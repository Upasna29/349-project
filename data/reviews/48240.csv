I LOVE this game.\n\nHowever, I cannot rate this positive at all.\n\nUPlay may be a joke, but it is a sufferable joke. The real problem is much scarier than that.\n\n----------\nSolidShield.\n----------\n\nWhat is SolidShield?\n\nSolidShield is a software DRM engine that was built for corporate applications, NOT computer games. In the business world, people only upgrade computers once every few years. By the time they upgrade a couple of times, the software is obsolete and has been superseded by a later version.\n\nMany gamers are completely different. A lot of us format our machines at least once a year, sometimes more often than that. A lot of us change our hardware semi-regularly as well, particularly video cards, hard disk drives and memory.\n\nThis is a huge problem, you see, because all of these changes change the hardware fingerprint that SolidShield uses to 'protect' its software payload. It's akin to the Windows activation system with the very major difference that it it is extremely hyperactive, and very intrusive.\n\nAccording to Ubisoft, who has said in the past that the PC gaming market is terrible, we are never allowed to change our hardware configurations. If we do, we are obligated to buy a new copy.\n\nUbisoft says piracy has caused them to require this ridiculous DRM system, which isn't suitable for games at all.\n\nI counter that the existence of SolidShield in this product is causing people to prefer pirating this game to buying it. After all, if you pirate it, you'll actually be able to install it when you feel like playing it in two years' time.\n\nI've never before seen a company that shows such a disdain for its customers. If it were up to me, I'd remove ALL DRM from Anno 2070, and give it away for free (or a lot less than its $60 price tag) as an apology to all of us for having to put up with this travesty.\n\nUntil TAGES SolidShield is COMPLETELY REMOVED from this product, I cannot see how anyone could possibly rate it positively.","January 6, 2015","false","054.2"," 4,458 of 4,834 people (92%) found this review helpful 186 people found this review funny","92","458","4","186","136"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tiberiusbrain/recommended/48240/","tiberiusbrain","ImperatorTiberius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tiberiusbrain/","94 products in account","Anno 2070 is a very good game! When compared to older Anno games they've really taken some bold moves and they do work well. However, I am NOT RECOMMENDING this very GOOD GAME. Related designs (the developer) has done nothing wrong, Ubisoft (the publisher) does a lot of things wrong. I will tell you a bit about the game, but also WARN you about Ubisoft and their pushy ways. I wish someone told me before I bought this game, because I wouldn't have bought it! Please read along!\n\nA few years ago I was playing CivCity Rome. Off course I had heard of Anno, but untill then I had never played it. Then I tried Anno 1404 and I was instantly sold. Anno is a citybuilding game that is always set in a specific era. Instead of needing power and water, your citizens would like to have food and goods that you need to create for them. You build your city (or cities) on a map consisting of a bunch of islands that each have their own resources which you will need to create the goods you people want. When their wishes have been met, they grow a level. This causes the house to grow and support more people but it also generates more taxes for each citizen living there. Anno always goes very deep, you have to manage the fleet of ships carrying the goods around, time them, have the right amounts in stock etc, and sometimes when I'm about 24hrs into one sandbox game, it starts to feel like a lot of work! You must keep the production going, sell excess goods, don't go bankrupt, build that monument, manage trade routs,,,\n\nAnno comes in many flavors, just pick your favorite age and go! The latest installments are the most consistently playing ones, and with this new Anno 2070 they really made the game a lot more accessible to new players and old players alike, when it comes to the amounts of resources in a map for instance. I have a few minor points of critisism about some of the made choices though. And for me, the futuristic theme is ok, but the style is a bit bland for my taste. For instance, in Anno 1404 the palet of colors was more vibrant on my led-tv for instance. I also like seeing dozens and dozens of wooden sail ships being processed at a big massive harbor, rectangular electric ships just aren't the same. When it comes to graphics in general, this Anno is really good looking with the later effects though. I still prefer 1404, but it's a matter of taste. The action (yes, there is also warfare, limited islands and resources mean war! sometimes) is still not really spectacular and really... I don't like it. I like the building and trading! I have not played this Anno a lot or a long time, but it plays familiar enough to judge that it is a good Anno. Related Design does not screw up their beloved Anno I think! Anno games are generally good, this one is no exception... however I personally still prefer Anno 1404, it also comes without Uplay, the reason I'm not recommending this game!\n\nI would score the game 8/10 if it weren't for the game's publisher Ubisoft. I would really like to warn you about them! Really annoying buggers they are!\n\nUsually here on Steam, when you buy a game it downloads and you can play it. No worries, no fuss. Sometimes there is some online DRM, annoying and pointless but ok... Sometimes it's an online game, understandable that they want you to create a seperate account with them.\n\nBut then comes along Ubisoft and their pushy Uplay "services". I know one thing, it's no DRM. When you buy a Ubisoft game here on Steam, as soon as you have paid for the game and you have downloaded it, it takes you away from Steam, pushes you to create an account at Uplay (which is Ubisoft's marketplace/Social Media), that is being published publicly.\n\nSo in other words: you're in Department store A, you buy product X and as you put it in a bag to take home with you a salesperson from Department store B comes along and forces you to create a public membership with their store, while you were in the first store to begin with!\n\nAfterwards, you can look in your settings to get your profile to be blocked from the public again if you want to, but as far as I'm concerned the damage has already been done. Who do they think they are, Facebook?!?\n\nWhen I accepted my fate and tried to apply for Uplay, it was impossible due to server problems! When I got tired of waiting to create my public humiliation, I went looking for fora. It seems ever since it's creation, Uplay has been plagued by downtime. When I waited these weeks in a row to create an acount and get confirmation I actually bought it, Uplay already existed over a year! And it also serves no further purpose. It does not autopatch the game, it just 'checks' if it's you and if you're allowed to play the game. Yes, what Steam already does. It annoys you with 'unlockable goodies' for games as you play (stuff that already was in the game and screenshots(!), but blocked because of idk, so you had something to unlock online), you can start finding your friends again, it needs to be constantly online while you play the game. Also it downloaded the game again as soon as I managed to create an account.\n\nLook at it this way. Valve is singlehanded carrying the PC-gaming sector by itself. It saved PC-Gaming and has achieved Cult-status. I mean, come on. Well over 60 Million people choose to be here on Steam. Ubisoft is just pushing their own store upon unsuspecting people walking around in this store! And then publicly humiliating them with their social media crap. They are trying to ply away the customers and public from Steam. If you have read this review, and then still buy any Ubisoft game... you clearly do not share this view of Steam, and I wish you a good day. To those that agree with me: if you have a game in your steam library that requires this Uplay crap, please write a review about it!\n\nWhen we look at EA, we can see that they have Origin as their store. When I buy an EA game here on Steam "(like Command and Conquer or the Sims), EA does not push me into an Origin account. We can all hate EA for a lot of reasons (for me it's Red Alert 3, C&C4 and that city game that came between simcity 4&5), but I give them credit for that! The games that do require Origin (Fifa, SW:TOR, Battlefield and Simcity) are not for sale here.\n\nI can accept another marketplace that digitally delivers games and software. No problem, competition is very healthy! But I cannot understand why Valve allows these practices. I mean, go ahead and try this in real life. Try to lure people from a Department store into another and I bet security is kicking you out! It's just common decency! I am not going to buy another Ubisoft game untill they either close Uplay entirely or stop pushing it with their games! That's 100% certain. I would probably have bought something there eventually, but not after this, I'm done with Ubisoft.\n\nAnno, to me, is a singleplayer game! I have played a very few games of Anno 1404 with a friend, but not a lot of people feel like going for a 24hr game in multiplayer. Still, with this whole Uplay non-sense it does not play offline! There is no reason to force something as intrusive as Uplay down our throat with a game like Anno. After that short period of being very angry with Uplay and Ubisoft I decided to delete the local content and delete Uplay. The whole attitude of Ubisoft with their Uplay causes me to score the game with 3/10.\n\nUbisoft, please change your ways! If you don't trust Valve and Steam in their sales, don't sell your games here! Stop pushing your complete store/social media like this!!! Related Designs, please ask Ubisoft to change their ways, or go find a new publisher, I am not buying the next Anno as long as Uplay is still on it. I'm also not playing Assassins Creed 3 or 4 or Far Cry 3!\n\nI have created a group about Uplay, please join if you agree: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/boycot-ubi","December 5, 2013","false","52.9"," 2,185 of 2,806 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","185","2","0","203"

Not worth anywhere near $30, and the DLC is pricey for how little it actually adds- most of it's just re-skins.\n\nAdditionally, I'd have to say that the gameplay is very lacking. It has 2 factions, but they play very similarly, and no matter what campaign you do most of what you build is repetitive.  All in all, a poorly-made game made nearly unplayable from DRM. 3/10, would not recommend.","November 1, 2014","false","74.7"," 564 of 706 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","564","706","5","0"

Very well done interface outside of actual game as well- with the factions, faction reputation, events, global voting events to 'elect' officials that boost different stats every week or so. I was, and still am, very impressed with this emmersion.\n\nUnfortunatley, its really no longer maintained well by Ubisoft. World events are, as of this posting, no longer going on (and you pay for these as part of game and DLC). Tremendous problems with their third party DRM ( in the multiple years I've owned this I have had no less than 5 issues that were gamebreaking and had to be resolved and hindered playability). In addition, since updated Uplay workings (around Sept 2015) I have had problems saving the game. It was working fine and then this happened - not sure 100% if it a causation effect or just a correlation. This is not a game where you finish too many levels in one sitting hence it has made the game all but unplayable for me!\n\nAs a game - I highly reccommend it. I very much enjoyed so many aspects. However...\nThe condition of the game, and how it simply just doesnt work well these days - I would not reccommend you buying.\nHope this helps a bit in your choice to buy or not!","October 28, 2015","false","111.9"," 229 of 272 people (84%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","84","229","272","7","5"

Okay, steam is not the problem - but registering at ubisoft is.\n\nBut i am really trying to start the game since one hour... not possible.

Starting ANNO 2070 in offline mode - it should work, right? The game launcher said, it's possible of course.\n\nHah! But not with the commander... "connection to server error" and a "Login" Message since 8 minutes. Huh, what about the offline mode?

I wouldn't do it again.\n\nIf you think, my review is totally wrong, then do a research within the STEAM forums or the internet itself. And trust me: The people are not the problem.

I call it an RTS, but it is an economy focused RTS, and can be played entirely without any combat or war what so ever.\n\nThe focus of the game is on building your society up and seeing to your peoples needs.\n\nThe single player features a story driven campaign which serves as a good starting point to learning the basics of game play. There is quite a steep learning curve to this game, but luckily there are a lot of resources online to aid new players. Also there are some really in depth guides hear on Steam that can help out in a variety of areas. Don't be put off by the massive amount of information involved in this game, you can learn how things work, and why you do it is very satisfying.\n\nGraphically Anno 2070 is demanding, and you'll want a high end card to get the best out of the graphics. But it looks great, for sure one of the better looking stratagy games out there.\n\nThis game is probably more like a city building game with a strong emphasis on economy, and supply chains. So if your into that, you'll really enjoy this.\n\nThe pace of the game can be slow a steady. If your looking to build up and make everything work, you need to take your time. So the game, once you get the hang of it, is very relaxing.\n\nIf you have any interest in this sort of thing at all, you should pick it up.

Take UPlay out of the picture and this game comes highly recommended!\n\nIt saddens me that there are so many negative reviews for this wonderful game, and all of them are due to the draconian implementation of Uplay. I've been lucky enough to not have any problems with Uplay or the DRM, so I will speak only to the game itself.\n\nIn the new, wet future, you are charged with rebuilding society and wrestling the dwindling resources from what is left of the waterlogged planet. Maps consist of several islands, both above and below water. Your goal is settle a colony and grow it accordingly to meet your citizens needs to work your way up to the tech level needed to satisfy the mission objectives. You start each map with a single ship, and enough supplies to get your first colony going. There are 2 major factions: "ecos" and industrialists, and the third faction, techs, are available to both. You can also start building with the opposite factions buildings after you have reached a certain level of citizens. Each faction has several tiers of development, with the highest tiers requiring an insane amount of scarce resources/factory combines to get the finished products needed to satisfy demand.\n\nEach map has different objectives, and you are given a lot of freedom in how you want to meet your goals. Do I want to spam out a lot of low end housing and industries, or work my way up the chain to produce more lucrative products? Either approach, or a combination of the two works - but your citizens get increasingly needy and harder to please the further up the tech trees you go. Random disasters and events (some scripted) also crop up to keep things interesting.\n\nIt's pretty easy to stay on top of things and zip through some of the earlier missions, where you only need to deal with a few different resources and citizens needs. The later missions, and especially the expansion ones, will have you scrambling for dozens of hours to keep up with your multi-island society of thousands of citizens. It is incredibly rewarding to finally beat one of these after whittling away at it for close to a week!\n\nImportant to note: There is some combat, but the focus here is supply & demand, logistics, and keeping your balance out of the red. If you like RTS games, or lots of action, you probably will not have a good time here.\n\nOne thing I really like with this game, and wish was the case more often, is that it does not hold your hand every step of the way. It runs you through the basics, theres a database/help module, and the many different types of alerts warn you when something major needs your attention. Systems are there to automate trading, both at each island depot themselves, and trade routes with ships. There are tons of technologies to research, and even more to unlock through discovery/rewards - however many of these that you will need to complete mission objectives are quite well hidden. This part could probably use more in-game explanation, as I had to search online several times to find out how to get what I needed.\n\nThis is definitely one of those games that makes you lose time and sleep - be careful playing if you have to be up early the next morning!","July 23, 2015","true","182.6"," 82 of 100 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","82","100","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamsWrath/recommended/48240/","SamsWrath","SamsWrath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamsWrath/","1551 products in account","Anno 2070 offers the perfect synergy of RTS, City Building and Trading. I recommend the complete edition because the Deep Sea expansion adds a layer of extra depth to the tech trees.\n\nIn Anno 2070, the size of your city is limited only by the size of your island--and there are some really BIG islands. If for some reason you aren't satisfied with your island, build some nukes, launch them, watch the pretty mushroom clouds and then move into your newly acquired glass parking lot (island). Don't feel like remediating nuclear radiation from your newly conquered paradise? Try sabotaging your enemies' main food source--destroy an oil tanker off the coast of an enemy island (preferably next to their fish hatcheries) and while he/she scrambles to clean up the oil, harass the cleanup crew with fast attack boats or helicopters and then send in your attack fleet. Even better, with the Deep Sea expansion, you can create tsunamis to wipe out your enemies' coastal holdings by destroying strategically placed geothermal power plants. After all, your citizens are worth more than your enemies' citizens, especially if your enemy happens to be the Eden faction... those hippie tree-hugging ♥♥♥♥s! Pick the Tycoons and use the power of coal and nuclear energy to crush the little Eco ♥♥♥♥♥! There's no Captain Planet to help them against your rain of nuclear fire! Crush them and their tree covered islands and pave over everything with concrete!\n\nAnno 2070 is not your typical city builder. As I explained earlier, this game is more of a hybrid City Builder, RTS and Trade Sim. Unlike traditional city builders, Anno 2070 has warfare. If warfare isn't your thing, you can play a peaceful game or you can eliminate your enemies through economic policy (hostile takeover). A hostile takeover is not as intricate as it sounds because all it involves is buying out enemy island shares until you have greater than 50% but, it adds another unique aspect to Anno 2070 game-play.\n\nAnother feature that sets Anno 2070 apart from other city builders is that you, the player, have 100% control over everything that is constructed. Compared to traditional city builders where the AI constructs buildings after the player zones an area for residential/commercial/industrial--Anno 2070 gives the player COMPLETE control over all structures: construction, destruction and placement. This is the perfect feature of the anal-retentive City-Building fanatic because it allows the control freak to CONTROL!\n\nPlacing buildings in Anno 2070 is almost like playing a puzzle game. Its always good to maximize space so when you're building in Anno 2070, be prepared to destroy and rebuild. I have over 200 hours in my current continuous game and I've rebuilt each of my major cities 3 times. I also razed and rebuilt the entire power grid across all 29 of my islands (largest map size). The reason for the rebuilding is pretty simple--I keep thinking of better and more efficient ways build, produce goods and house my citizens. My 3 largest cities started with max populations of: 29,000, 29,500 and 34,000 and each of them barely had enough power to keep on the lights. Now, those same islands boast populations of 34,500, 37,500 and 40,500 and each island has 1000+ excess power to share with the power grid.\n\nHonestly, this game is a blast! The only reason Anno 2070 doesn't have 'Overwhelmingly Positive' reviews is because people hate on the Uplay DRM. I agree that its annoying but, its no reason to avoid one of the best city builder/rts hybrids of all-time.\n\nEDIT: I noticed a number of people complaining that Uplay doesn't work for Anno 2070. Since I hadn't played in a few weeks I decided to boot it up and see if there was a problem. Uplay works just fine. The Steam version of Uplay is outdated. You need to update Uplay and everything works just fine.\n\nThe fix for this is so simple its mind boggling how many people fail to see it when its mentioned in numerous threads within the community hub. I know the Steam fan-boy knee-jerk reaction is to hate/blame any third party DRM so I guess I shouldn't be so surprised.\n\nEDIT 10/17/2015: I see the reviews for this game keep slipping BUT not because the game-play is bad. The reviews are slipping because a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥-♥♥♥ Steam fan-boys hate Uplay DRM. Sorry boys but, Uplay works just fine and has done ZERO to inhibit my Anno 2070 gaming experience.","November 15, 2014","true","544.7"," 470 of 705 people (67%) found this review helpful 47 people found this review funny","67","470","705","47","30"

However, there's a very big problem with trying to play it.\n\nShortly after acquiring the game, I got a new graphics card so I could attempt to run this on max graphics. However, I didn't realize that a "SolidShield" function would block me from playing the game. In addition to this, the game likes to crash. In my 70 odd hours of playing, the most I could play consecutively was maybe an hour and a half to two hours. My 70 hour campaign looks like a 40 hour campaign because of all the time I lost from crashing.\n\nThere's one other outstanding problem with this game - the online play is awful.\n\nBack when I bought this game (quite a while ago), when you invited your friends (lets say you're inviting 3), only 1 could get in and the other two would error out and not be able to join. The chances of getting all 3 players in were very slim, and if you wanted to save and come back to the game later, you'd have to go through the cumbersome process all over again.\n\nThere is an online DRM for this game that many seem to complain about, and I don't blame them. Having a game, specifically this one where you're in it for hours not interacting with others, is redundant. Ubisoft's stance on piracy and their expensive games have lead to this online DRM for practically every one of their games nowadays.\n\nIf Ubisoft fixes crashing bugs and if you don't upgrade your computer hardware while wanting to play this game, I'd recommend it. Unfortunetly, the bugs have been present for a long while and I doubt they'll be fixed, so I'm inclined to write this game a nevative review.","June 18, 2015","false","73.5"," 65 of 85 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","65","85","2","1"

Think of it like a far more advanced, far more stable, version of Sim City, with missions, singleplayer, NPCs, combat, and trading. Not to mention underwater city building.\n\nYou can choose from 2 factions in game - An ecologist faction and a trade faction, each one with its advantages and disadvantages. As the environment plays a fairly key role in the game, your decisions as to how your islands develop and the pollution they produce can seriously affect end-game production, as more and more buildings are required to cope with the diminished returns of crops and livestock. However, pollution is necessary for supplies and income to be produced en masse; you, the player, must decide on how you choose to build up your city(s)\n\nAnno 2070's soundtrack is nice, without being too overbearing; it's certainly more mellow than other games, but for good reason. It's a nice listen, and I never play the game with music set to off.\n\nThe game's graphics still look beautiful, even for a game that is 2 years old. The lighting and shadow effects are phenomenal, with water rendering that doesn't much detract from my FPS. What isn't shown in the screenshots is the underwater portions of the game, in that you can build supply depots and other research facilities under the sea. I strongly suggest if you're interested in that sort of thing you look up a video on it, it's rather amazing.\n\nOverall, the game is fun, very fun, enough to warrant a solid 8.5/10 from me; its seemingly laidback start to any game belies a hidden undertone of complexity not seen in most city building games such as this one.","December 27, 2013","true","23.0"," 59 of 80 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","59","80","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vadok/recommended/48240/","Vadok","UberVadok","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vadok/","20 products in account","Anno2070 is an economic game with Tier based progress system and basic elements of combat.\n\nThe game has decent Video, Music and Interface settings. At highest settings with "i5-2500K @ 3.30GHz", "GeForce GTX 560 Ti" on 1920x1080 I have significant frame rate drop, but nothing unplayable. At just high settings it looks fine and works excellent.\nYou have key bindings for the most useful actions, but any nondefault settings are stored on server, which means you have to reconfigure them for each offline session.\n\nGame launches via Uplay client. It is weird to see 2 game clients while playing Anno2070.\n\nThe story is about the future with rised level of sea. The gameplay is based around island colonization (including underwater plateaus), building cities and product chains.\nYou have 3 playable factions: Tycoons (or Global Trust - industrial conglomerate), Eco ( or Edem Initiative - global environment organisation) and Tech (or S.A.A.T - faction of scientists). There are third parties you may interact with during missions. There are aggresive parties, parties that are good for trade relationship, some may colonize islands. You may declare a war or do thier quests and gain reputation which gives access to different functions.\nIngame progress is usually the next one: setup Tier1 residences, goods and construstion material production; evolve to Tier2, setup Tier2 residences, goods and construstion material production and so on till Tier4. The difficulty rises with Tier progression because productions may require resources from different islands, you have to extend productions of previous Tiers and do not forget to upgrade residences, and everything requiers certain mount of construction materials at certain place. AFAIK there is no way to tell how much goods does population need and how much production you should build in order to support it. There is no even ingame indication how much ihabitances, let say, Tea plantation may support. You have to use some wiki information and demand calculator for it.\nEven so it seems very tence, at practis it takes a huge amount of time to reach late state of the game. Pure rush to Tier4 can take 1-1.5 hours.\nTech faction has interesting ability to research stuff (surprise!). It can give you items to boost production, extend raw matherial deposits, upgrades for your Ark etc.\nArk is basically your cross-mission storage for goods and upgrades which is available from the beginning of the mission. In some situations Ark functionality is partially unavailable.\n\nThere are natural disasters like Acid rains and Tornados. The last one can be very devastating. Your Nuclear Power Station can even explode and cause Nuclear Fallout if you are not careful.\n\nThe Combat system is presented by ships, aircrafts and submarines with their strengths and weaknesses. For the late game there are also nuclear missiles and power shields available.\n\nThe game also offers achievement system and Career progress with some unlocks like titles, skins for your avatar, Ark, some useful buildings and researches for Ark upgrade.\nThere are daily quests and World Events to help your Career progress. World Event offers new Easy, Medium and Hard missions chain with unlocks that depends on type of Event.\n\nThe game has Campaign, Continous mission, Single Missions and Domination mode.\n- Campaign is basically a big tutorial, has generic plot with its silly moments, but is ok, gives you a feeling of being involved in saving the world... again ;)\n- Continous mission is a mission created by player with wide variety of customization like third parties, amount of resources, win conditions etc. You may also make it as multiplayer by inviting people.\n- Single Missions are basically predefined Continous missions. Some of them can bring a real challange like "Power Games", so if you beat it you are somewhat prepared for the Domination mode.\n- Domination mode is where currently all peolpe are playing. It is a passive team multiplayer. You have map with different missions. Domination conflict has its length and time limit per day. If you don't spend all your day limit, it will transfer to the next day. You compete in achieving scores with specific goals like achieve Balance value, energy production, trade balance etc. You cannot meet neither your competitor nor teammate directly in mission. Once you get more scores than your opponent, you dominate mission and receive bonus scores. The winner is a team with the most scores at the end of conflict.\nThe problem with this mode is that most conflicts have 12 hours/day setting and usually the winner is not the skilled one but the one who spent the most its time. Also there is some domination rating, which AFAIK affects nothing. So unless you play versus skilled players (which are usually attracted by 1 hour/day setting) purely for fun, it quickly becomes boring.\n\nThe music is awesome! For 200+ hours of gaming I didn't get bored. It is very thematic and atmospheric.\n\nAnno 2070 has fair Business model which does not break game balance. It offers bonus contents which otherwise are available by compliting specific World Event or getting specific achievement.\n\nIf you like complex economy management, sick multitasking, strategic planing and step-by-step growth with Tier unlock, this is definitely for you. If you find yourself in situation when game says you "Dude, you have been playing for 6 hours! Stop it!", then you know this is your game!","November 28, 2013","true","799.1"," 57 of 84 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","57","84","0","1"

It is a great game to relax at due to its slow nature. You can even turn off military actions within your skirmish game so you can focus on building up your city and anything you want. You can take as many islands as you wish and build a city and production on every one of them. Eventually you can get to build underwater production which is an exciting addition to the game and a wonderful idea. Even after multiple hours of game time you can't actually finish building everything because there is simply so much to do and build.

And it pain me that I could not play it.\n\nBUT to play this game you have to install UPLAY and bend over to what ever decision Ubisoft make. And don't get me wrong. I don't mind a 'nicely done DRM that treat the customer right'. But I don't support DRM done wrong that consider every single buyer to be 'potential pirate'.\n\nThe fact that Ubisoft want every of their players connected constantly is only the proof they are completely out of their mind. They have imposed real bad DRM over the years (the destructive Starforce for example) and they have pushed the whole system over the edge.\n\nMixing a limit of 3 activation for a game, with the need to be constantly online is just.... how to say.... feeling like I need to pee in the check tube every time I connect to my computer and have the police of the town authorizing me to move around with an electronic bracer and a tailing car.\n\nTo emphasis this, when I added the game in my wishlist, the page was not 'clearly' indicating the 3rd party and 3 activation limits.\n\nBut when a friend offered the game to me, for my birthday, I first though "nice, will finally try it", before finding out it was asking for Uplay.\n\nHaving had my share of problem with Uplay with Assassin's Creed (preventing me from playing through the first, and even killing any desire I could have to try to play to the second and 3rd that I bought), I felt forced to install it nonetheless as it was a 'gift'.\n\nDon't take the 2 and half hours as an indication about my play time. As in fact it took me over an hour just to have uplay working. And once I had finally all that thing working, I ended up trying the game, and was in fact starting to 'enjoy' it when suddenly I was kicked of the game and lost my whole progress without any more information than "You lost connection to the uplay server".\n\nSo, if Ubisoft want to screw us over with their DRM, please don't give them any money. The only way to show them the light, is to vote with your wallet.\n\nExert your right to put bad companies out of buisness with your wallet.","October 29, 2015","false","2.3"," 31 of 42 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","31","42","0","0"

It is an above ground and underwater city builder with complex city management and trade.  HOWEVER, UPlay is a horrendous gaming network and a DRM of 3 installs is appalling (to say it kindly). When I discovered I could only install this on 3 machines I was quite disappointed.\n\nUbisoft support also seems seriously lacking. My son recently made purchase of a hardcopy ubisoft title, registered it to his account but could not download it - was just stuck in a registration loop. He was outright ignored by Ubisoft/Uplay official support contact - even after posting for help on their Facebook page. Eventually he exchanged the game for something worth twice as much (and not needing Uplay). So he posted again to their facebook to let them know he didnt want their assistance anymore because they are useless and he had solved his problem. Within minutes they deleted his post from the page making us well aware that Uplay had seen his original help request but they had deliberately ignored it.\n\nI'd hate to see what will happen when I have to contact them for a new key for Anno when I next upgrade my machine. If the same DRM restrictions exist for the new Anno when it is released I simply wont be buying it ... ever. In fact my experience with the few Uplay games I do own has taught me to be extremely wary of investing in any Ubisoft games again.","September 27, 2015","false","179.5"," 32 of 45 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","32","45","0","0"

I haven't played any other Anno games so I cannot comment on if this is a good or bad Anno game, but I've really enjoyed it. You have to build a city while managing a bunch of different resources, which are used to upgrade your city and advance up the technology chain. You can only get certain resources from some islands, so you need to either expand your empire or trade with other players. It's a little complex, and it can get very overwhelming in the late game when you are dealing with many islands and every resource, but it's really satisftying when everything clicks into place and you have a functioning chain of islands.\n\nThe big downside is the Uplay DRM. It's actually problem-free for me, but I can't deny that it is utterly useless. It runs in the background for no real reason, and you need to sign up for a Uplay account. If you're lucky like I am, that's all the  interaction you'll need to do with Uplay. I know some people have an avalanche of problems, so your mileage may vary.\n\nGet the Deep Sea expansion, because it adds a whole new faction to the game and it feels incomplete without it.\n\nI'm not sure if the campaign really goes anywhere, and the bulk of the game seems to be based around the sandbox-esque continuous game mode. So, if you're looking for goals and missions, you might want to look elsewhere. If you like managing cities and supply lines, and micromanagement is your game, you'll probably have a great time here.","October 7, 2014","true","54.2"," 28 of 43 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","28","43","0","0"

Using futuristic technology, you must build a city to complete various goals while balancing the favor of three factions.\n\nThe main campaign for Anno 2070 revolves around a rogue A.I. and the steps that you must take to protect your people while solving the puzzle of how to defeat it. The story is told through in game events as you complete quests, and through pre and post mission cutscenes. While story can be somewhat secondary in these types of games, I found it rather compelling and was definitely interested in what would happen next.\n\nFor the campaign mode, you will be designing your city so that you can complete certain goals given to you by one of three factions, which are representative of business, technology and environment. Towards later missions you will be balancing the needs of multiple factions, whose unique buildings or abilities you will need to complete your quests. Since your city is persistent through multiple levels, this can create some issues while you are planning. You may spend one whole mission optimizing your city for the tech faction, only to find out later that you will need high level buildings from the business faction to continue. Your cities are mostly built on islands, and square footage is at a premium, so this can be problematic. Luckily for the most part there is not much of a penalty for having to tear down a building to place something new in its place, but still you can find yourself having spent hours designing a city perfectly just to find out later you have to tear it down.\n\nGame balance is done very well. You will need to provide your citizens with certain goods, depending on what faction they are from, and most of these goods can be manufactured in your buildings. You will need to balance your cash, power supply and ecobalance to complete each mission, and luckily there are generally ways to increase each if you are patient.\n\nGraphics are top notch, as our sound effects and voice acting. A lot of effort was put into the creation of this game, and it shows.\n\nAfter completing the main storyline, there is still plenty to accomplish. There are council votes which you can participate in, and will give you bonuses to certain factions. There are many scenarios to play through. The main story can take you upwards of 20 hours or more to complete, and if you still want more to do, more is available.\n\nOverall, I would completely recommend Anno 2070. It has that one more turn mentality that can keep you hooked for hours at a time. There is so much to do even after the main campaign that you will definitely get your money's worth. Anno 2070 is highly polished, well balanced, and very, very entertaining.\n\nScore: A-","August 14, 2014","true","16.3"," 45 of 75 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","45","75","0","0"

Unlike other strategy games like Civilization, Meridian: New World, Starcraft, etc, this game focues on more realistic ideals. Economy, Citizens, Resources, and the Environment are the main aspects. Now you may say that this game sounds like any other, but it focuses on these aspects greatly. You can't just build a mine on a resource and expect it to instantly be accessible and have the resource flowing to your city. Time el facto is one thing, it takes time for resources to go from point a to point b. Citizens have needs and there are different demographics for citizens. They level up as you fulfill there desires earning you more technology and resources. The economy is based on your tax income and expenses. Unit maintenance, citizen's needs, tax rates, and trade all affect tax income. The important part is the environment. Disasters, cities, units, and resources are affected by how polluted or clean the environment is. Great game, Co-op is good, everything is good.","October 26, 2014","true","147.9"," 44 of 74 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","44","74","0","0"

I have never been able to launch it (I can get into the main menu). I have tried numerous times in five years. Ubisoft DRM stops me everytime. You can see I have 3.5 hours of time in-game. That's time spent attempting to connect to Ubisoft's servers, and also time the game (at the main menu) has been minimized while I've been troubleshooting. Nothing. Numerous support tickets over the years have not even yielded a single response. I have one open now that's been unanswered for a few hours shy of a week. Worse, I am not an exception to these issues. 62% of ~7000 reviews are positive, and quickly scanning the negative reviews shows that a large number of paying customers share this problem. That's at least 2500 customers that Ubisoft has basically written off over the years, and it doesn't even include the customers who don't own the game on Steam or haven't given it a thumbs up/thumbs down. That's bad. I wouldn't chance this if I were you.\n\nEdit: For anyone that's curious, after ten days I finally received a response from Ubisoft support. I was told I need to activate the game on Steam. In fairness, I'm not sure I made it perfectly clear in the support ticket that the game is installed on Steam, so I messaged them back. We'll see where it goes. It is worth noting I think the ticket classification which is essentially "key is already in use" corresponds with an error message you get in-game that tells you all the same. This is why I didn't specify in the ticket, as I thought it was obvious. If I was having an issue activating a game on Steam, I certainly would be contacting Steam. Ubisoft's prescribed steps don't even seem to work, as the Steam Product Activator doesn't recognize the CD key string as a valid string. Indeed, given the sheer number of reviews complaining about having the exact same problem I am having, you'd think Ubisoft would... well...","April 30","false","3.8"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","22","34","2","0"

When I write them, its hard to put my thoughts into words because my understanding of a game is almost always different than another person's understanding. Nonetheless, I need to write a review for Anno 2070 because i've spent enough time with this game to put my thoughts into words. TL;DR is at the bottom if you want it.\n\nI'll start with what most people consider the deal-breaker with Anno 2070, which is Ubisoft and their toadies Blue Byte and Related Design. Ubisoft, in their *infinite* knowledge, decided to shoehorn in their UPlay DRM for what seems to be no reason. In fact, all it does is break the game for some and make another hoop to jump through for others. Either way, its annoying. But reviews on Steam aren't gonna stop them, so I won't drag on about them.\n\nBut I will drag on about Blue Byte and Related Design. If these guys weren't owned by Ubisoft, I can make a safe bet that if these guys were runned by a more consumer-friendly company, than we wouldn't see issues like losing integral parts of the game overtime or having to jump through hoops to get the game running. But the problem is that these developers are too afraid of telling Ubisoft to shove-it, so we end up with all these issues in their games. I know that both of these developers can produce very amazing games, but because they can't be self aware we end up with carcasses of games overtime.\n\nEnough about the people, let's get to the game. It is basically the mammoth of the Anno 2070 franchise. More factions, more AI competitors, more goods, more everything! This was my first Anno game, and although it was a little overwhelming at first, I got the hang of it after a while. This game is luckily very well polished, and has been updated overtime to make a better experience. The soundtrack, graphics, and mechanics are all top notch. I couldn't have asked for anything more. I'm not gonna get into the gameplay, but once you look on YouTube or you play the campaign it'll become easy to get the hang of. I do want to warn you though that certain features are just plain different from when the older videos were made or when the campaign was made. As of writing this review for the game I am in the works of creating an updated tutorial/let's play for anyone who wants to get into this game now. That may be available at some point.\n\nLet's just address some new things before I end this review. The DLC is certainly worth it, and expands the game so much you can't resist. It will make your life easier. However, the only DLC you may want is the Deep Ocean expansion. The rest is just little cosmetics or things that will be a minor benefactor in the end. As for the current state of the game, they removed the 'World Events' system, which is a little bit of a pain, but you'll probably still be okay. The best part of Anno 2070, in my opinion, is the experience building and nuturing a whole civilization. That won't ever be going away, so if you wish to share that experience, then this game is certainly for you.\n\nTL;DR: Although Ubisoft and their Toadies are a pain, the actual game is a breath-taking experience that will be a staple of the city builder for a long time.","April 17","true","382.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

The production chain building and shipping from island to island is well done and is quite fun. It also offers a surprising amount of replayability. Also unlike some other old Ubisoft titles (Endwar springs to mind) the serverside portion of the game (voting on events, timed missions, ect) is still running and offers a good shakeup. Its worth noting that I haven't tried the domination multiplayer gamemode, but it looks like it is very good.\n\nI unfortunatly can't comment on the graphics because every computer I've run this game on is a potatoe, but thats my problem.\n\nOnto what caused so many people to vote this game down, the DRM. I personally haven't had any trouble with it but I installed Uplay before hand because of other games, so I don't speak for the majority of the playerbase aparently.\n\nThe elephant in the room, Tages, almost never caused me problems and when it did it was understandable. The only time I ran into an issue was when I was messing about with VM's and I only ran into the problem on the 5th VM try. All it took to fix it was talking to ubisoft support to get it sorted out, and I haven't had a problem since.\n\nAll in all, near perfect game (the combat is very obviously not the focus of gameplay or design work) with a little bit of annoyance related to DRM, but nothing that even got me close to upset. I'd recomend this game at anything up to $45, as the amount of enjoyment you can get out of it is amazing.","July 4, 2015","true","103.4"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","19","30","0","0"

The single player campagin starts as the corporate tycoons exploiting the earths resources, you can see the beautiful environment slowly fade and erode into nothingness. An island that once was inhabited by deer and bears becomes barren and the beautiful seascape of whales and dolphins becomes empty... This is until the game introduces the environmentally friendly faction which attempts to establish a balance with nature, with a slower production rate, yet sustainable resource consumption rate.\nSo far the game seems incredible, until they introduce the second campaign... there are so many random events with litttle to no explaination of solving them... such as poison fish, special build technologies, or most frustratingly telling you oil is available and buildable until a special event occurs.

Unfortunately in Anno 2070, the campaign got in my way: instead of having time to learn the ropes, experiment, and calculate building production, I was almost immediately forced into a time-critical deficit situation. For me, at least, it took out the parts I find fun about city builders.\n\nThere are lots of other ways to play Anno 2070, so I imagine it will work better for other styles of play. Certainly, with the three types of economies, the multiplayer features, and the frequent "event" chapters, there is a lot to do.

Managing the needs of your sector and cities within can sometimes be a juggling act in itself. If you're looking for the pace and speed of say Command & Conquer or Starcraft. This isn't for you. If liked those games, and also liked things like SimCity or other builders I think you'll enjoy this.\n\nThe amazing emmersive soundtrack, and top notch voice work, splended visuals, and solid gameplay really add up to an enjoyable experience be it for a quick daily mission game or, whole evening dive into continuous play. With multiple game modes, multiplayer drop-in, world-events, user interactions through elections and making choses, advancing up your career ladder.

I have spent 30 minutes so far navigating the jargon of Ubisoft, and I am NOT pleased with my experience.\nI even have an excellent gaming PC and fantastic internet ability, but the company is crap for requiring always-online server play. It nullifies the experience, especially when Ubisoft seems unable to actually provide the type of networking they need.\n\nIt's all bull and I won't buy another of their games EVER again. They were even keen to make me use another form because I happen to be several months under the age of 18, which I completely understand, but it would be nice if the website they directed me to was actually available.\n\nThe poor planning behind what looks like a beautiful experience has made me less keen to enjoy it. I'm glad I paid only $13 instead of the rediculous $50 price of the regular bundle. What baffoons these developers are! I'd even go as far to say it's worse than the launch of SimCity 2013. And that's saying something.\n\nLong rant short: great game, I love what I see, however, if your computer and ISP aren't up to the challenge, abandon all hope of getting to enjoy it. Meanwhile, I'm going to try again to actually play.","January 3, 2014","false","26.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The number of structures, units, etc. is stunning.  There are three different, largely unique buildings tracks, each with their own style and appearance.  The fun part is mastering each and then using them together.  While the diplomacy and combat are somewhat rudimentary, they are adequate and add a further level of complexity to already intricate gameplay.  Moreover, it is a gorgeous game.  You will play this game for one hundred hours and still be amazed by it.\n\nThe problem, of course, is getting past the first 5-10 hours.  This game has a very large learning curve and has almost no tutorial. What tutorial exists is a very bad one.  I believe this is why this game has received bad reviews in the past.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game highly, if you have the endurance to learn its gameplay.

The campaign does an insufficient job of explaining the parameters you are expected to operate within, and the free play lobs ridiculous and unnecessary obstacles at you (like starting you on an island that cannot support the medium level upgrades necessary to develop your civilization). The game play is severely extended to the point where it's beneficial to leave the game running for 30 min unattended to mine the resources necessary to advance another 10 min. The graphics are undeniably stunning, and the soundtrack incredible, but this is unfortunately icing on an otherwise pretty bland cake.\n\nAfter 15 hours of getting annoyed and flabbergasted at trying to figure out what I thought must surely be a pretty good game, I have given up.

I loaded the game within 11 minutes and it took me another 60 minutes to get the game installed, registered, activated and updated.

The initial experience is that it patches the patcher to patch the updater which updates the initial installation of uPlay garbage that Ubisoft inflicts upon you in order that you might eventually be allowed to play the game. After 5 patching screens, I get the UPlay program open, and still no way to play the actual game. Had to kill uPlay with task manager and restart, and finally got uPlay to acknowledge that, yes, I have the right to run the game. Thank you. Can I play now? No, actually, I need to put up with in-game ad for ANNO online, and a request to go fill out a survey about my ANNO playing experience on Survey Monkey. Really, guys? Are you serious?!\n\nWhen you do get to play, I find it to be too much story, too many distractions from game-characters, and campaign scenarios that are uneven in quality. For example, where you need to just build a city that produces so much fish, and then the scenario is over. Weak. It is also uneven in hand-holding, where I found it irritating to be told exactly what to do next, and then suddenly run into a situation where I had no idea of what to do to get some stat up to the critical level for the hokey scenario to finish.\n\nAs a game, it isn't terrible. If your video card is less than three years old, you might be OK on that front, though my dual-GPU card was definitely stressed to the point of an early heat-death... that was on the lowest settings, to be clear. On my new system, at the time of writing this, it works very quietly on the lowest settings. Now that I've reloaded it on my new system, I will probably enjoy it more, but my earlier experience has soured me on Ubisoft, and ANNO 2070, certainly.\n\nIt is, underneath the hokey storlline, an ANNO game in the end. But for me, I just cannot get over having to put up with the idiocy that is uPlay. I've promised myself to never pay money for a UbiSoft game again, due to that crap.\n\nIt's pretty. Underneath a butt-load of flourishes, bells, and overdone whistles, it is an ANNO game. But, I recommend dropping back to a previous ANNO and playing that instead.","December 26, 2013","false","116.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I'm not sure what Uplay is or what it does, but I don't like having it forced on me.  If it offers me something worthwhile, then I'll opt in.  Not giving me a choice simply shows that you have no confidence that I'd opt in if given the choice.  If you have no confidence in what your own software offers the consumer, then why should I?\n\n2.

But set against the backdrop of its predecessors, I can't recommend it. Every time I opened it up I was left feeling saddened by the missed opportunity.\n\nThere is a built-in conflict described between the eco-focused and development-focused factions, but this conflict isn't enforced by the game's resource exploitation models and tech trees. They took it halfway there with an eco-damage mechanic, but the two factions should have been forced to adopt diametrically opposed progress conditions, rather than the carbon copy mechanics we see here.\n\nAn example: both sides possess the same number of housing tech levels, with the same mechanic for evolving them (population numbers plus availability of secondary goods). Since there is very little crossover of secondary goods, there is no tension between eco and development factions when reaching the highest goal - the ecos don't care about lobsters and champagne, and there's enough rice farms to go around.\n\nInstead, we should have seen the developers require huge numbers of tightly-packed houses to advance, coupled with a flourishing economy; and the ecos requiring a low number of big-footprint houses coupled with minimal environmental impact. This means that the factions would always find it hard to coexist at the top development levels, and it'd always occur to one or the other that things would be so much simpler if the other's stuff would just start blowing up.\n\nWhich leads to the second problem. The tactical and strategic combat wasn't thought through very well at all. Put simply, you don't make rock-paper-scissors work better by restricting the number of choices players have. All three flavours of combat units - air, land, sea - should be available, and the balance between them should be a determining strategic factor. Strengths versus weaknesses. Instead we have a world with NO land-based forces except for the occasional (and limited) turret, restricted air availability, and a poor tech advancement tree.\n\nA caveat on the last: there is actually a brilliant research and development tree available via the scientist faction. Unfortunately, it doesn't have the impact on gameplay that it deserves. There is no need to pursue a technological race with your adversary, since it's far more efficient to just spam out more low-tech units.\n\nMakes me sad, considering how brilliant parts of this game are. Lost opportunity. Then again, maybe I should just get off my ♥♥♥♥ and learn modding, since the game is well supported in this area.","December 26, 2013","false","164.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Sure, it looks fantastic and at first glance has a lot of depth. After I bought it I was very excited of finally calling it my own. But that's where the trouble started. The Ubisoft launcher is a catastrophy to put it mildly. It took hours for countless updates to install and I had to enter my serials three times. Needless to say that my excitement about the game shrank considerably. The whole point of buying games on steam for me is to avoid all the nasty installation procedures, click a button and more or less start playing. The only good news here is, that after going through the hellfire of the initial installation the launcher is less agonizing. Still it may take 10 Minutes to just launch the game. Big fail.\n\nWhen you can FINALLY start to play you're pretty much on your own in a world you know only little about. There's a campaign mode which I tried to start with. Quickly I ran into trouble just because I couldn't figure out what to do in order to fulfill the goals. The game doesn't teach you at all. I abandoned the campaign mode and went for the sandbox. Youtube videos on how to play the game helped me to make some progress and pretty soon I settled on a bunch of islands doing great. The game became fun! Big plus ...\n\nBut that was about all I got. The game just became stale. There was nothing left to do. So the few moments of excitement went away and now I can't be bothered to turn the game on again. What a shame, but this game is honestly one of the most boring and repeatative games I have ever played. Despite it's beauty and appearant depth, there just isn't much of a challenge left to it once you've played for a few hours.\n\nSo I'm sorry to say that I can't recommend this great but utterly boring game. The ubisoft launcher alone kinda kills it to begin with, but the gameplay just didn't manage to excite me enough to forget about this.","February 15, 2014","false","16.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Much of the appeal of the original was finding your own solution to a very broad set of objectives, but 2070 adds a campaign that provides a rigid structure to the missions that feels far too constrained, and it has thrown in additional mechanics that serve only to restrict how you can build and interact with the world.\n\nIf you enjoy these kinds of management games, I'd recommend picking up 1404 plus its expansion, Venice, before even considering Anno 2070.","December 24, 2013","false","36.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

In order to play the game, after downloading, I had to sit through about 40 minutes of patches, including a forced membership with Ubisoft's useless 'Uplay', followed by patches for Uplay, followed by downloading the game again, through Ubisoft's sad little robotic clone of Steam. Steam says I have played this game for over an hour. I played it for 2 minutes last night, just to see that it works, only to have to sit through more updates, a faulty uplay connection, and the second download today! I don't even know if this is a good game or not, but if their choice in publisher is any indication of it's makers' good judgement and professionalism, then I have my doubts.\nI will never buy another title with the word 'Uplay' anywhere near it. Ubisoft might as well be on that list as well. This kind of abuse of a captive consumer makes pirating seem attractive, and justified. I believe in paying people for their hard work, but I work hard for my money too, and this waste of time feels like theft to me.","February 22, 2014","false","3.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Unfortunately, this game ends up frustrating the casual gamer due to its programming style of keeping the player constantly micro-managing items. Ends in wasting a lot of time and it is rather pointless as entertainment value of a game. The other game aspects such as missions and graphics are satisfactory and graphics are ok for mid range computing power. Noticed some slight bugs but otherwise pretty solid as a game build. I purchased game on a Steam sale but I would have regretted paying full price. The fun factor is only 5 out of 10. IF the micro-managing was made simpler and game play focusing more on building and battle tactics then this would have been a fun game. I would only recommend this to supertaskers, but because I am a casual to mid range gamer I would have to say purchase only when the price is in the bargain territory.","February 13, 2014","false","62.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However, it's not that interesting playing after a few times because the optimal action to take is always the same.  City building is completely rigid without fuziness, you always know exactly how much resources you have and need.  You can't advance without having satisfying the exact same condition, determined by the exact number of population and resources you have.  The lack of wiggle room, fuziness, and randomness makes city & unit building a mechanical task and a chore.\n\nThis migh not be an issue if you play the game for the combat, but if that's the case there are plenty of interesting RTS out there more focused on combat.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aurumlamina/recommended/48240/","aurumlamina","Aurumlamina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aurumlamina/","1108 products in account","For those of us looking for a top notch economic simulator with a focus on strategic city building, Anno 2070 will scratch that itch and then some.  You'll be expanding accross a number of islands (and viable plots of ocean floor) on each map that produce and grow independently from one another which makes creating trade routes imperative if you hope to make them prosper in the long run.  A fun campaign injects a story and special objectives into the game, but the large number of maps available keeps Anno 2070 playable for a long time after that.\n\nYour colonies themselves have a lot of customization available as you would imagine with a city builder.  Three different population types are available each with their own unique perks that they can offer.  There are the money-obsessed, capitalism-loving Tycoons, the beauty and clean living Ecos, and the science fanatics known as the Techs.  Each has several tiers of classes to unlock within them as long as you meet their ever-growing list of demands.  Workers may not ask for much but executives will require a significant, continued supply of resources that will take some commitment to produce.\n\nCreating and maintaining trade routes requires a level of micromanagement but when you hit that sweet spot and start shipping the near-perfect quantity of a resource from your single colony that produces it to all of your colonies that use it to produce more advanced goods you feel an incredible sense of accomplishment.  Watching the economy thrive and grow after having built it from the ground up is fantastic feeling.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone and everyone who enjoys city builders and economy simulators.  This is easily one of the best ones that I have played.  Few games of the genre manage to reach the depth of Anno 2070 (pun intended?) and I still start the game up from time to time even having completed the campaign quite some time ago.","January 20","true","27.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Especially the endgame is really complex with many things to do. Anno 2070 pushes the series to incredible highs and is amongst the best in its genre. The easy to learn controls and rules, new online options and the way you can build while preserving nature all make this the best strategy game of 2011.The developers have succeeded in creating a game faithful to the tradition and at the same time a game full of new elements and mechanics, that make it feel fresh. All that, plus a great campaign and a variety of multiplayer options make Anno 2070 an excellent game and even some technical issues can't change that.Ubisoft made a great decision in taking the Anno franchise to the future. Trading, building, doing quests, there is a ton of stuff to do. It's very interesting to see the environment play a big role and the effects of polution add a great new gameplay concept. Anno 2070 really is all about building and trading and won't be fulfilling for people that are looking to rage war.It's about expansion, trading, economics, boats, and staring at a lot of awfully pretty sci-fi buildings while you do so... which, frankly, is more than an enough for me.Glancing 60 years into the future and learning from old mistakes, Related Designs made a masterpiece.","February 24, 2014","true","22.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It appears to follow the path of the previous anno games which where great fun (even the one on the DS). However, i have not actually had the chance to play anno 2070 yet, due to the amount of time it took to update the game itself after download (expected). As i was greeted with the request for a serial key, i had to remind myself that it wasnt 2006 and that i did buy this game on steam (supposed to stop this), but ok, its only a few clicks ill roll with it. As i progressed though this, i was then greeted with a SECOND digital distrobution platform.. uplay. Hold on, did i not buy this game on steam? no uplay, uplay why are you updating.. ok ill wait. About 30 mins later, i was bored and lost a large chunk of my playtime for that session.\n\nA few days later i thought, hey uplay will be updated, ill give this another blast... uplay was not fully updated and took another 30 mins or so to get me updated. A which point i was greeted with a login screen within uplay... WHY is this game forcing me to sign into two platforms?\n\nTLDR: The game has a dual digital distribution, requireing two online accounts to use. Why? no idea.

It told me that the game would be registered against my Uplay account, but haven't I already done that?\n\nThen, I had to create a profile in the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Debra_Beretta/recommended/48240/","Debra_Beretta","Debra_Beretta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Debra_Beretta/","88 products in account","I was recommended this game by a friend of mine recently as I've been playing a lot of strategy/citybuilders. So far, I'm enjoying the scenario mode, I haven't played endless, MP or the individual missions but the only glaring issue I've found so far is lack of a real tutorial. The game prefers to throw information at you on an "as and when" basis, whereas I'm the kind of person who'd like a thorough run through of all the basics before I dive in. Still, that's nothing that would put me off as I'm a fairly fast learner, but I'm aware that there are those out there who might be put off by the level of complexity with just an in-game "manual" to refer to.\n\nThe gameplay is what you'd expect from games of this type, functional point and click with plenty of micromanagement. I loved how simple it is to manage your resources and trade networks and to quickly sell off any of your stockpiled surplus to make a few quick dollars, I've never been very good at budgeting so that was quite a help when my depots started to fill up.\n\nGraphically, it's absolutely gorgeous to look at with some absolutey beautiful levels of detail (the fat guys working the sugar beet production plantation made me giggle a bit) on structures, vehicles, NPCs and landscape, the underwater areas have fish, rays, jellyfish and other marine creatures which makes exploration something very enjoyable.\n\nIt sounds lovely too, a nice, non-intrusive score which nevertheless conveys the atmosphere of the game very well and the change of track from over- to underwater was a nice little touch. The NPCS voice actors are well chosen for their roles with my only criticism there being of Dr. Salman Devi.. where are you from, Davi?!\n\nI'd definitely give this a thumbs up to anyone familiar with strategy, citybuilding and suchlike. There are a wide range of expansions to keep you busy once you've cracked the game too which should push its longevity, definitely worth the money!","April 26, 2014","true","89.4"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Decades after the global warming that melted the polar caps and changed the face of the Earth, you are put in charge of an Ark: an aquatic base of operation that travels the seas to establish new settlements on oceanic islands, managing economy, resource exploitation and relations with other factions. This review includes all DLCs and the Deep Ocean expansion set.\n\nPros: This is a great addition to the Anno series, this time taking place in the fairly-near future without going too sci-fi (that's for Anno 2205 to do). Like past iterations of the franchise, you start with a limited amount of resources and must build industries with to make more building material. Citizen classes are upgraded by providing commodities, and the quantity of citizens you have of each various classes will unlock more buildings and options. The game looks great, factions are easily recognizable and the islands are gorgeous. You can play a continuous free-mode game or pick from a large selection of mission challenges. You also have a campaign mode which is a great gradual introduction to the evolving selection of buildings and to the factions you can side with. You pick between the economically-strong Global Trust or the ecologically-sustaining Eden Initiative factions, and can also ally yourself to the scientific and underwater-expert S.A.A.T. faction. The Uplay community is actually made use of for something else than serving as a DRM: the various factions will regularly put up proposals players can vote on, there are online elections to pick a governing faction that will offer changing bonuses, and the game downloads a temporary "mission-of-the-day" Daily Event.\n\nCons: The game doesn't have an actual tutorial, so even the introductory campaign will leave you wondering whether the next step is a building, an option, or an upgrade. Combat was obviously not the focus of the game which makes PvP multiplayer games hard to win. Although all three factions have different buildings and citizen needs, they ultimately are the same thing with different name on them: Global Trust uses has Distilleries while Eden Initiative has Tea Plantations, S.A.A.T. has a production chain for Carbon while Global Trust has one for Concrete, etc. The material a faction can't make itself is material it simply doesn't make use of, so there is little need to trade with other factions.\n\nVerdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list\n\nThis is a great city builder! Like other games of the Anno series, it's very different to manage building material and citizens commodities than the usual complexities of budget, taxes and municipal services. If you enjoyed past games of the franchise, or simply want to try a different formula than the other City Builders out there, I strongly recommend giving Anno 2070 - Complete Edition a try!\n\nP.S.: The included Uplay appears to be broken for many people, so you must manually download the latest version (which you can do here[static3.cdn.ubi.com]) or the game may not work at all. That's too bad for what is essentially a good game.\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","September 27, 2015","true","36.0"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

It has a fun atmoshpere. It promises cool city building with a focus on trading, resource management and tech.\n\nIt is blindingly tedious and complicated. And not the challenging kind of complicated, the, "What in the holy heck does the game want me to do to advance?!!!" kind of complicated.\n\nThis game is so frustrating becaue it really is the most beautiful and polished turd on the market for the building sim genre. You will love it for an hour, and then struggle to find enjoyment the next 8 or so before you finally realize this game has nothing to offer beyond tedious resource grinding for ever-decreasing gains.\n\nI want to like this game so hard. The premise, the gloss, even parts of the gameplay, but I just cannot recommend it. Especially after Steam and Uplay had a battle on my hard drive and installed it twice (only game thats ever done that). But that actually worked out for the best, because now when my friends ask, "How is ANNO 2070?" I can honestly reply, "It's so bad I deleted it twice!"\n\nEUIV, Civ V, SimCity, even CitiesXL (which has no trading) will offer a better experience.\n\ntl;dr: A very pretty, very polished trading sim with terrible gameplay mechanics and incredibly low replay value.","February 26, 2014","false","34.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sevaarcen/recommended/48240/","sevaarcen","Sevaarcen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sevaarcen/","197 products in account","I bought this game about a year and a half ago during the steam summer sale of 2013. I enjoyed the game at first, and learned about U-Play.... If I enjoyed it then why did I not recommend the game? I don't reccomend the game because I think that the core gameplay is dis-functional, and it's mostly notices after various games. This is a long review but in-depth. Read on for more info.\n\nEngine:\nLet me start out by saying that ever time, before i launch the game, i have to validate the game files or else the game crashes randomly. I looked it up and this is a known engine bug that existed in the last Anno games as well. Ubisoft must not have thought that the game-breaking bug needed to be fixed. (Remind you of any recent Ubisoftness)\n\n-Pros/Cons:\n+ It CAN work\n----- Bad Engine\n-- Crashes\n\nGeneral Gameplay:\n\nLet me start out by noting there are two player factions which change looks and core gameplay. Power production and even the resources you need to get to the new tiers change. I only have played with the Tycoons since they are my style but they both look fun. I've never taken the time to play extensively with the Initative. More details can be found below on each aspect of gameplay.\n\n++ Diversity\n\n- Resources:\nThe gameplay is supply chain and resource production. You build your iron mines, smelt it into steel, and then produce tools from the steel. Managing the buildings, citizens, supply and demand, food, and fleet can be a challenge at times. If you are into micro managing things than you're probably going to like the gameplay.\n\n-Pros/Cons: ~Meh\n+- Supply chain\n+- Management\n\n-Economy:\nThe problems arise in balance however. You start out with little money, barely enough to get your island under control and produce more. Often the money ammount is so low i cannot get the revenue i need, even through trading, to keep my island running smoothly, so that has made me loose many times. The money will make you loose more often than a war.\n\n-Pros/Cons: ~OH MY GOD HELP ME!!!!\n--- Horrible economic start, you start behind\n-- You'll keep encountering money issues until the late game\n+ More citizens = more taxes = more money\n- Diplomacy\n\n-War:\nSpeaking of war, war is bad. The AI start with a fully developed Island and fleet, not you however. This screws with the balance. Ships can really only start to be made in the mid-game, and AI has a fleet in the beggining. Even when you get the materials to make ships (supply chain) you can not make much ships. If by this point you have done something horrible, like building a building that makes the AI mad at you (more on this in a little bit), it's game over. Ships are so hard to build at the start i've only ever had one game where I could even produce ships, but I only ever made two because of the budget (money issues again). Im not sure how well balances war is if everyone has ships, i've never had more than one attacking ship.\n\n-Pros/Cons: ~Dunno, I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO WAGE WAR!\n----- Horribly unbalanced, game ruining\n-- AI always ahead\n-- Hard to make any fleet to defend\n-- money needed to do anything cool with a fleet\n++ no excessive micro managing during battles\n\n-Diplomacy:\nIf you ever try and use diplocy you will be mad. Diplomacy isn't like civ where your trading resouces, it's just you paying the AI for services, like delaying another AI, not expanding, ect.. The prices are steep so you'll most likely never have the money you need to do what you want done until the end game (more spending). If you're in the end game I don't see why you would nbeed their services though. As I mentioned earlier, the only actual diplomacy is where you do something that pisses the AI off and they send you a threat. You have two options, follow through with the demands or declare war. YAY for options.... If you actually have a fleet by the time you receive the threat you might be able to fight.\n\n-Pros/Cons: ~Never used\n-- Useless\n+-- AI Threats\n\n!! Example: I needed oil to start a new production line and get to the next tier, so I expanded and build oil wells. Then I receive a threat from the oil baron AI, "Destroy all your oil wells and production or declare war." I couldn't destroy my oil without consequences and didn't have the money to just buy his oil (More economy issues, again) so I was forced to declare war. I thought it would't be that bad and he'd just leave me alone mostly, but he charged in with high level warships and leveled my main island...\n\nIsland colonization:\nI actually liked this gameplay aspect. You can colonize other islands and produce good that can't be grown on your main island (depending on the island). Then you can create an automated trade route to exchange resources. The only problem is that you need a cargo ship, so one will always be busy. If you want to trade also you'll need at least two cargo ships or to stop the transport temporarily. If you need two ships you'd better be able to build the second one, so you'll need money (wow, more money needed. Cargo ships are the easiest ships to make though). If you chose to repurpose the main ship then it can stop the production chain which can cause unhappy citizens and then tax problems leading to a ruined economy in the long run (...).\n\n-Pros/Cons: ~I Enjoyed it\n++ Different islands\n+ You can intercept transports to ruin a players economy (works both ways)\n+ Underwater islands (This is more late game so i've never been able to use them)\n- Could maybe use even more island diversity\n\nGraphics:\nNow since im over with the gameplay let go into graphics. Not too bad actually. Futuristic looking, of course, so sleek building and interesting vehicles. Good graphics overall.\n\nPros/Cons: ~Good\n++ Futuristic\n+ Nice looking islands\n\nSound:\nIt's been a while since I've played and I mostly forget the sounds of the game, but I don't remember anything annoying me so thats a big plus. All i remember is that I liked it\n\nPros/Cons: ~?\n++ Nothing annoying\n+ It works\n\nThe Verdict:\nBuy this game if the gameplay is your style, you could enjoy it more than me.\n\n-For me though 5/10.","December 27, 2014","false","11.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Unfortunately I can't really review it properly because I have NEVER BEEN ABLE TO LOG IN TO UPLAY EVEN ONCE SINCE BUYING IT.  Uplay just says CD key in use, even though I'm logging into the exact same account that I made for the game.  I have been wanting to experience this game for YEARS and I paid full price for it.  I never knowingly bought another Ubisoft game since, as the way I see it, they literally just stole my money and ran with it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AKLANK/recommended/48240/","AKLANK","Klankers","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AKLANK/","284 products in account","Don't buy this on Steam.  Just don't.  Buy it elsewhere, because it's usable there.  Anno 2070 is essentially the block before Simcity 2014, by a different AAA publisher.  Always online DRM, launching through Uplay, and really-sketchy Steam integration makes this game impossible to recommend for the majority of audiences that want to play it for the first time.\n\nA few notes before the game critique:\nYou can still resolve issues with Uplay by installing Uplay before downloading and activating this game through Steam.  There's some manual patching you need to do, but that does put off a large portion of the audience.  Pick it up if you're willing to put in the effort to get it working; as of late 2015, Ubisoft hasn't addressed any of the fundamental problems with getting it running\nMake sure you have a machine you'll play through the entire game with, because this Steam version acts as one copy.  I can't play this copy anymore because I upgraded to Windows 10; and thus my previous machine (which I can't go back to) has this copy on it.  Make sure you've got it on a medium that Ubisoft trusts you to have it with, be it on Uplay originally or a physical copy.\nThis is not the game for you if you don't have great internet.  If you lose access to Uplay servers, you could forfeit your current work even on the single-player campaign.\nThe ProsAnno 2070 is a gorgeous addition to the series that adds a lot of addicting features.  Citizen management, faction alliances and tech research all feel much more interwoven than in previous titles, and given the futuristic asthetic, it seems pretty coherent.\n\nThough I don't think it was executed as well as it could have been, the story mode was very immersive and I found the real-world themes of industry vs environmentalism to be very engaging.  There's different styles you can set things up to appeal to the masses and obviously multitudes of methods to accomplish those means, which I found very encouraging for me to find my own solutions to problems I had (usually) brought upon myself.\n\nThe ConsAs a first time player, this was really, really hard for me to get into.  I actually went back and played Anno 1503 to sort of understand what the game was asking for and to acquire a general feel for how it's played.  Thereafter, though I like the very high-tech and modern feel of the game, I don't think the intro or tutorial to the game were well done at all.  Having gone through it's predacessors, I struggled re-learning the specifics of new units and buildings, as well as having the map  awareness or sense of scale to do quests at apropriate times.  It's a very challenging game, and it mostly leaves itself for the player to figure out.\n\nMy VerdictAnno 2070 is a game you likely won't play, and will regret not doing so.  Though it's built on the previous titles quite a bit, I don't think it inhibited my progress at any point and kept me coming back for more.  I ended up "sinking" many more hours in this installment than I did in 1503, and hope to play 2205 soon.\n\n8.25/10\n\nHowever in the current setup on Steam/Uplay, I do not recommend purchasing this game for the sake of your future playing it.  Anno isn't a game to be played for 5-10 hours and then put down - heavens no.  This is something that I find rivals Age of Empires, and you might end up sinking well over a hundred hours into it.  If you lose your copy (like I did) you would have been better off buying it somewhere else.\n","March 19","false","0.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Features such as the underwater islands are an interesting touch, but there is little that you can actually do with them.  Everything else about the game is just Anno 1404 with a few new building types and new names for everything.  I'm all for sequels to good games sticking with the format that works, but they have to add enough content to justify their price tag, and this one didn't.\n\nAs if to add insult to injury, the game also REQUIRES Ubisoft's UPlay launcher to start the game, which REQUIRES you to have a UPlay account (yet another username and password) and be always connected to the internet.  Aside from the fact that I object to this type of publisher account where it adds no value to the game for the consumer, but the software itself is unreliable and often fails to connect or crashes before I can even play the game.  Not to mention that this is on top of the existing TAGES DRM which imposes the 3 machine activation limit that was present in Anno 1404.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend people play Anno 1404 (with the Venice expansion pack) instead and save themselves the heavy price tag and immense frustration for a game that adds little to the fantastic Anno series.","November 30, 2014","false","26.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Misaniovent/recommended/48240/","Misaniovent","Misaniovent","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Misaniovent/","161 products in account","This is one of a few games that I see myself coming back to for years. I had two favorite games when I was a kid. One was Total Annihilation -- I particularly loved the navies and building my ports. The second was Simcity 2000. Creating a well-functioning system was satisfying to me. Even moreso when I could see it destroyed.\n\nThis is more or less what Anno offers. Anno lets you build a vibrantly complex system of factories, farms, and cities. They depend on you to improve their lives and when you find the balance to do so, it's very rewarding. Combat is secondary to the logistics and economics that are core to the game, but the naval combat is satisfying without being so complex and fast-paced that you cannot attend to the rest of your island empire. It's close to where it needs to be, but there's room for improvement, particularly when it comes time to actually conquer an island or quickly remove an enemy's production capacity. You can also fall victim to disasters: underwater earthquakes that bring tsunamis, massive tornados that will run across your islands like a laser from the sky, nuclear meltdowns and nuclear missiles that will send your people screaming for shelters.\n\nThis is also one of the most polished games I've played. There is an incredible amount of visual and audio detail everywhere in the game. Each tiny house has inhabitants. Every street has pedestrians -- pregnant ladies, playing children, hovering trucks. Panning across the oceans you're likely to see a pod of whales or, when you go underwater, a school of fish chased by a shark, with divers exploring in the background. It really makes the game feel alive.\n\nThe campaign is okay and the scenarios are worthwhile, but the meat of this game is in the sandbox. It also has a well-designed persistent system that lets you carry items and resources in your mobile headquarters from map to map, ensuring that you only ever have to start from scratch if you really want to and offering room for you to customize bonuses your empire receives so that you can put effort into certain strategies.","September 4, 2014","true","480.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The Anno series is unique and unlike other city building games. Anno is all about micro managing and making sure your islands have the correct resources while balancing production buildings. Once your citizens are satisified, they can level up into a more prestigous catergory which will require more needs to satisfy the upper class.\n\nThe game has awesome graphics, its very pleasing to the eyes.\n\nThe DRM used to be a lot worse than what it currently is. Don't let that hold you back from getting this game, its well worth the price. I paid full price for it but grabbed the DLC when it was on sale. The Deep Ocean DLC is worth if once you understand the mechanics of Anno.\n\nI also must note that the game has quite the multi player options. I found it very confusing and never used it, just always played Campaign.\n\nSome important campaign tips: Google good map seed numbers to get good maps that are very big and have lots of mines / rivers / resources / etc. Discover and inhabit as many islands as possible right away. If not, the AI will get it develop it to kick your ♥♥♥ at war. Keto is ♥♥♥♥♥. Hector is annoying but easy to beat as a beginner. Always check your productions lines are working correctly and you don't have huge shortages or surplases. Trading Carbon/Kerosene is the fastest and easiest way to get money fast.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n","December 26, 2014","true","533.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Uplay.\nI know, I know, it's a pain in the ♥♥♥, but it's mostly because Steam doesn't bother to update it (with good reason). The updates made by the launcher itself dont work, which means that you just have to download uplay off of Ubisoft. A 3 minute effort for hours of fun with a really nice game.\n\nDont listen to the negative reviews my friends, please, Uplay isn't that much of a hassle, and definitely shouldn't hinder your decision to buy.\n\nAnno Anno Anno.\n\nI loved the game. It's just hilariously fun to build up your island as a tycoon or tech and then decide you want to nuke everyone else. Loved those aspects of it. City building is fun and difficult, ensuring an interesting experience, and campaign seems quite entertaining too. The lore, which I have not really gone into much lately, is interesting on the surface, and I especially like the conflict between Tech, Tycoon, and Eco.\n\nCombat is interesting, with each faction sporting strengths and weaknesses, and I LOVE the whole submarine side of it, really recommend the DLC and all.\nDiplomacy is OK, but I've only scratched the surface and all, since I'm currently sanctioned by, let's check, every single faction on the map, because of my avid use of nuclear warheads. The islands I conquer are currently glass, but I think that I can monopolize on the cathedral building business.\n\n10/10 Would play again\n\n","December 31, 2014","true","13.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

A mixture of Total Annhiliation-style warfare and epic scale, with the micromanagement of Sim City, and the trading aspects of an empire management sim.\n\nIt does so many things right, that it will just suck out your free time, like a black hole.\n\nThe Tycoons are the remainder of the present-world high-industrial, short-term, high-profit, fast-building race; which have significant advantages in the early game as well as military, but struggle in the late game.\n\nThe Ecos are a future-gazing civilization which try to maintain and raise their "ecobalance" (the general health of an inhabited island). They are more difficult to learn, but more rewarded overall as they have beautiful architecture, and their late-game resource demands are significantly less difficult to micro-manage than the Tycoons. They do suffer from certain technology lacks- namely the Tycoon's nuclear reactors, and battleships.\n\nThe Techs and other races are "spoilers", so I'll let you discover their benefits and drawbacks on your own.\n\nOverall, Anno 2070 is highly worth the purchase, especially when it's on sale.

A third, science like organization unlocks later regardless.\n\nBut Anno is an awesome title, the game play is city building/god game, that rellys much more on trade and management of trades, that isn't really found in most games.

The gameplay is easy to get into but has a profound complexity which slowly unfolds in regular play as your city branches out and your responsibility grows. While single-player free play can entertain you for hours on end as you attempt to foster one or several factions under growing pressure from both the environment and challenger factions, multiplayer can refresh the gameplay and make Anno 2070 feel like a whole new game. The only real drawback for this title is that it's tied to U-Play.

You can build a civilization together. Dont forget to keep your citizens happy.\n\nYou fo need uplay to run the game. Everyone complaining about it not working, is trying to play the game without uplay installed. Well, just about everyone, I'm sure theres outliers.\n\nIt's an excellent addition to the Anno franchise and worthy of the title.","June 25, 2015","true","17.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although it may not have the exact same elements it does bring in an interesting naval combat ability. I really like the way the building feels and placing things the way you want feels easy. This is important since the islands you settle can be small. The vaarious production chains you have to mange are awesome and the trade routes are excellent.

The error dialog has no further explaination of what action to take and only permits you to close it.  I am left unable to play this game.\n\nEDIT: After three days I got a reply from Ubisoft customer support with instructions on how to re-install the Uplay launcher.  For some reason all of the slash characters in the email were removed (or invisible) which made links and paths to registry entries difficult to decipher.  After some difficulty I got the Uplay launcher working which resolved my issue and allowed the game to run.\n\nFor all the good work the game devs did on the actual game it's a shame that the Uplay launcher is as shoddy a piece of work as it is.  I'm not anti-DRM as long as it does NOT get in the way and is PROPERLY MAINTAINED AND SUPPORTED.  Telling customers to hand edit their registry is a VERY BAD idea.  That sort of thing is the entire reason for installers, updaters, and launchers.\n\nBottom line: I enjoy the gameplay but the mediocre customer support and sloppily designed and maintained launcher / DRM has damaged my respect for Ubisoft.  Since I finally got it working I'm happy enough to play the game but even with that if I had the option for a refund I'd take it.","July 3, 2014","false","471.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The UPlay feature is just like everyone describes - hard to get it to work.  You essentially have to modify the security settings on the Uplay folder.  Well I did all that, and was able to play Anno 2070.  Its a good game, complicated, intertwined, good graphics, well thought out, interesting game play.  I wish there was a tutorial, but that is a mnor gripe.   But over the next several days I realized ALL the other games in my Steam library stopped working in some fashion.  Either I could not even get another game to start, or the default key bindings kept getting messed up,  or the other game thought i had not signed into Steam when clearly I was signed in, etc, really weird things on games I have played for months without any problems.  Suddenly I realized what was going on, I uninstalled UPlay (the UBI game loader software) and Anno 2070 and guess what?  Everything else started working...   Guess what company is no longer getting my money?  ANYTHING regarding UBI Soft will be completely disregarded by me.  My advice unless they change something?  Do the same - vote with your money and stay away from this publisher's games, unless they remove their gameloader software!  Its not needed, that what Steam is for!","December 4, 2014","false","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It was released in November 2011 and is a great game. I've put 7 hour sessions into this game, and I show no signs of stopping. It is a new, futuristic step in the series, and is a strong one.\n\nThe basic premise of the game is that the world's sea levels have risen and previous landmasses have become islands, and uninhabitable wastelands have become paradises. It is your mission to repopulate the world from your ark - a kind of sea station.\n\nThe ocean is a major focus of this game Much of the expansion and all battle and trading is done by sea. This makes a unit's speed, carrying capacity, armour and damage ever more important. The trading mechanism works really well, being able to set up a different route with each unit is easy and intuitive.\n\nThe game is great. It has an interesting style and great development of cities - better in my opinion than the newer Sim Cities. For example, my capital city on my industrial playthrough was growing and I was doing well, and I expanded onto another island. When I went back to my capital, I realised how dense the smog was around the city. It's details like that that really help build immersion and realism.\n\nIt's easy to sink hours into a game and not reach the endgame, or even the midgame. If you are a fan of real time strategy games like Age of Empires, then this game is a perfect purchase for you. This award winning mixture of diplomacy, war and construction is sure to win you over to it.","June 13, 2014","true","8.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's an interesting game, but unless something changes, I may never buy from UbiSoft again.\n\nI'll start with the good parts.  Anno 2070 is basically Caesar meets Red Alert, with a clever mix of city-building and war that I've seldom seen elsewhere.  While this is ostensibly a real-time strategy game, the combat seems to take a back seat to the economic development of island settlements.  You'll have to manage raw materials, electricity, pollution levels, population, food and drinks, entertainment, and military.  Fortunately the pace is slow enough that this is actually possible.\n\nThere are three playable factions, each with different production chains, and specialties.  The Ecos are stereotypical environmentalists with wind farms and tea planations, the Scientists are exactly as you'd expect, eating artificial food and building nuclear power plants, and the Tycoons are your run-of-the-mill capitalists with smoke-belching coal plants and fast food chains.  I haven't played long enough to really contrast them, but so far it seems to work out nicely.\n\nSo all in all, it looks like a great game.  So why am I not recommending it?\n\nThe observant among you may have noticed the one-hour discrepancy between how long I've had it and how long I've actually been playing it.  Let me start this explanation with a question:  If you buy a game on Steam and hit the "Play" button, shouldn't it just... I don't know.... Play?\n\nNo, that would be too easy.  Starting Anno for the first time went something like this...\n...Download and install.  Just as easy as with any other title on Steam.  Took a little longer than usual, but no big deal.\n...Hit the play button... Hmm, it wants to optimize my graphics?  Sure, why not.  Save me some time cranking up all the video settings.... The game seems to load up, and throws some graphic on the screen, and then immediately returns to the desktop.  Uh, what?\n...Now it should launch the game, right?  Or at least a settings utility?  Nah, it has to launch an auto-updater.  Wait a second... Isn't that what Steam does?  Automatic updates?  Why is the game loading its own update utility?  Hmm...\n...A little while later, that finishes... Time to play, right?  Wrong.  Now it needs to set up UPlay.  Apparently Ubisoft is trying to make their own Steam, and it's required for this game.  Ugh... Ok, as long as it doesn't get in the way...\n...UPlay needs to update itself.  Two seconds after it finishes downloading, it has to update.  Did I accidentally buy an MMO?  Is this World of Warcraft?  I thought I just bought a game on Steam, a platform that keeps everything up to date on its own...  Alright, I'll go get a snack while this thing updates itself... Again.\n...It finished updating!  Time to play!  Oh, it wants a CD Key.  Sure, no problem.  Grab it from steam, paste it in.  Done!  Let's play!\n...Now it wants me to create a UPlay account... That's just for online multiplayer, right?  I don't really need that... Except you can't load the game without it.  Now I'm getting angry, and if I hadn't already paid for the game, I'd have uninstalled it right there.\n...Fine.  Here's a throwaway e-mail account.  I'll use my usual username and a simple password.... Ok, I'll use a longer password... Ok, I'll add numbers.  What the hell am I protecting, a bank account?  This is just a game!  Fine!  Now the password is annoying enough that I have to write it down somewhere.\n...The username is taken?  Fine, here's another one.... That too?  Fine, another... Another... Another.... Just take this stupid incompehensible string of letters.  I'll write that down too... Just let me play the game already!\n...So, made a UPlay account.  Oh, it's not just an account.  It's an entirely new application that's probably going to destabilize my computer like so many before it.  Well, I can at least put it in offline mode.  After all, I don't plan on doing multiplayer in this game, at least not right away.\n...Now I need to login to it.  So much for offline mode.   It made me turn that back off.  Oh well.... Username... Password... There.  What do you mean that's not a valid username?  It's the one I just created!  Try again... Nope.... Ok, here's a wild guess.  Maybe, when they say username, they really mean e-mail address.  So instead of using that username that took six tries to find one that wasn't already taken, let's just not use it at all.  So why couldn't the e-mail just be the damn username!?\n...Login with my e-mail and password.... FINALLY, time to play... Enter my CD-key... Didn't I do that already?  Fine, copy and paste... Nope, can't paste... Alt+Tab back and forth, entering a few characters at a time... Fine.\n...It's loading!  It's loading!  It's the actual game!  Woohoo!\n...Create a character name.  Sure, no problem!  Xentor!\n...It's taken.  Wait, what?  I thought this was my character name... Why does it have to be unique?  Great, it's another stupid username.  Let's try a couple.  Taken, taken, taken.  To hell with it.  I'll just use the same one I used for the stupid, useless, waste-of-time UPlay account.  Ok, that works.  Now NEVER ASK ME AGAIN.\n...The game is starting!  And the first thing it says?  It welcomes me to the game, addressing me by that stupid unique username.  The game now constantly refers to me as that gibberish username, because OBVIOUSLY anything readable was already taken.\n\nSo, to my new enemies at UbiSoft... Here's a tip.  If you're going to publish on Steam, let Steam handle the DRM, because you guys obviously have no clue what you're doing.  You just lost a customer.\n\nAnd to those of you reading this review, considering buying the game... I leave that choice to you.  The game itself is good, but UbiSoft has tried very hard to make sure that playing it just isn't worth the effort.\n\nGraphics/Sound: 8/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nOverall: 2/10.","June 29, 2014","false","28.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This makes it a matter of trial and error to determine how much of what you need to produce. Which I find very frustrating. While I really enjoyed the time I did play the game, I now find myself wishing I'd spent that $30 on beer instead. I have thus updated my review to not recommend the game. It's a brilliant game that's just poorly executed. However, if you're considering it, I do recommend reading the rest of my review. The straw that broke the camel's back for me may not bother you as much.\n\nOriginal review is all of the following.\n\nTL;DR: This game is sort of in the gray area between SimCity and Civilization (closer to Banished than SimCity as far as city-builders go, if you've played that). It's a brilliant game, but with very noticeable cons. As gameplay isn't really affected by these issues, I'd describe the experience of playing this game as sort of like seeing a fantastic movie in a crappy theatre with uncomfortable chairs and somebody texting a few rows up. You still really enjoy it, but there are small things that bother you a little bit the whole time.\n\nMore details: I have many things I like, or even love, about this game. Many things about it are simply brilliant. However, before getting to those, let me first list the caveats without which I would not recommend it. Some of these may be a dealbreaker for you.\n\n-Uplay is very, very annoying. I consider Steam like the iTunes of gaming, and it's as though one record label was like "okay well you can listen to our music through iTunes, but only if you also open up our other music player software and first validate that you did indeed buy the music." It doesn't prohibit playing, but it's very, very annoying. It's just an extra step that's both unnecessary and inconvenient. And those extra steps add quite a bit of time between purchasing and actually playing, probably a solid 20 minutes.\n-The interface and keyboard controls are very counterintuitive (x and y to rotate the camera, really?), and there's no tutorial on how to play. I only figured out how to use this game with extensive use of Google on my phone. This is the sort of stuff one might expect or tolerate from an inexperienced indie developer's first game, but from a big name like Ubisoft it just feels like laziness. Either way, it makes the learning curve much steeper than it should be, and led to a few exasperated shouting matches with my desktop.\n-The cities seem to lack some things that are fundamental in other city builders. For example, there seems to be very little by way of transportation management. However, there are certainly other areas of the gameplay that make up for this, it's still overall a good game. Not necessarily inferior to other city builders, but definitely different from them. Like I mentioned earlier, it's much closer to Banished than SimCity as far as city builders go. Don't expect SimCity (you place every single building, for example, which is like Banished but unlike SimCity).\n-At $30, I find it a little overpriced. $20 would be a deal, and $25 would be reasonable.\n\nHowever, now let me get to why I do still recommend this game:\n\n-The gameplay is *awesome.* I've only done "continuous" mode (as opposed to campaign mode), and It's somewhere in the middle ground between SimCity and Civilization. You build your city on your island, but you have to explore the surrounding area to discover neighbors or uninhabited islands, and can engage in diplomacy or trade with them. Each map has so many islands, and you can expand to the uninhabited ones. In fact, you have to do that or trade to be succesful, because no single island would be self-sufficient for an advanced city. The way cities almost "level" based on what different classes of people demand and can produce is simply brilliant.\n-The economy is *very* well done. This is really my favorite part of the game.\n-The difficulty levels are well done. Easy mode is easy, but not pointless. It's just an easier version of a still very interesting and rewarding strategy game.\n-The backstory is coherent, intelligent, and complex. Which doesn't necessarily affect gameplay, but is nonetheless something I really appreciate. It's not without its simplifications that may annoy some of the more pedantic players, but definitely a big step above the norm for this sort of thing. The world you build in is still a thoroughly sci-fi/fantasy world, though, it doesn't feel like anything that might actually be around 56 years from now.\n-There are a lot of small details that are well done. When you zoom in, for example, you can hear what people are saying based on their class and satisfaction level.\n\nSeveral things I have yet to try, so can't remark on:\n\n-Combat\n-Advanced diplomacy\n-Campaign mode\n\nOverall, I definitely think the pros make up for the cons. I wholeheartedly recommend it, as long as you know what to expect.","August 31, 2014","false","6.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Not much to say, other than that pretty much everything looks beautiful.\n\nMusic & sound: The music and sounds are pretty good and fitting but not the best I've heard imo 8/10.\n\nRessource management and economy system: Tedious in the long run. You have to build ships to transport ressources from island to island e.g. island 2 needs Uranium for nuclear energy but uranium is only available on island 1. Unless you import them, but that is quite expensive. The devs did however add a feature that allows your ships to load / unload themselves at your docks, which really helps a lot and makes transport of ressources more or less autonomous. Still, when you start to have 20+ transport ships, it feels kind of like you have a major weakness should you go into battle with the other players. Like should one of them get destroyed whether by a tornado or an enemy, your entire economy on one island might collapse. I suppose it could be lessened by making every ship carry one ressource each rather than several, but that can become expensive to maintain money-wise.\nI don't give it less than 7/10 due to the fact you can make your trade autonomous (almost 100%) and renew your ressources (I'm honestly not sure if it's a good or bad things you can renew otherwise non-renewable ressources in rl such as coal...) but I also don't give it a higher score because...Well like I kind of said, the system gets kind of complex and annoying in the long run.\nAnyway, 7/10.\n\nTrade: Pretty much the same as above, you just make your ships autonomously load and unload their cargo at other players / AI's docks. Decent trading system, but I feel it could be better somehow. 7/10.\n\nWarfare: Simple and ♥♥♥♥ imho. What can I say, it's a sim game, not a war game. You do have planes, ships, submarines and some other things I can't remember, but it's not quite a good wargame. 4/10.\n\nClimate / weather events: As you can pretty much guess from the description of the game on its store page, your actions affect the environment around you. If you choose to pollute your islands, it could have dramatic effects on your economy, your islands and the other players islands. Oh and it can also happen at sea, so your ships might get destroyed by a tornado all of a sudden. I can imagine that climate system can lead to war in some multiplayer matches. Your people can also oppose some of your actions such as running a nuclear powerplant, fearing a meltdown. You can with techs reduce it to 0%, but the people doesn't seem to care :S Environmentally wise in this game...Let's just say you don't want to run a "Business as usual." policy for long. 9/10.\n\nResearch and production: Research is insanely and annoyingly slow. You can speed it up and maybe I'm just doing it wrong, but researching new techs as well as producing things in your lab takes HOURS. Literally. Production of ships and other units is decent. It's great once you finish researching though, techs / items you can use to e.g. reduce pollution generated by your coal powerplants or techs that increase your production is great. You can also create...Items? That makes you able to dig up otherwise exhausted ressources. Awesome but also odd given how coal is non-renewable (in human eyes) in the rl. 5/10 due to the insanely slow research.\n\nMultiplayer: I haven't played it that much, but it's one of the few strategy games where I actually like multiplayer and don't prefer single player a lot more than multiplayer. I especially like how there are events and campaigns where players have to work together to complete them, followed by rewards if they succeed (they usually do) for example: "Defeat this terrorist by destroying his bases in these 3 maps." then players help do that and succeed if they complete the maps enough times (not repetitive though). One more thing I especially like that involve other players is...The voting. In the game you can vote for things which will affect your gameplay. It's been a while since I played the game so I don't remember the names and all, but you get to vote e.g. for a representative for the tycoons, which then will increase your production of certain buildings should they win the elections. Anyway, the multiplayer is pretty much similar to singleplayer, meaning it's not laggy or anything. I love CIV V but I hate the thing about having to wait for your turn more than in singleplayer. Anno 2070 doesn't have a similar problem to that, which is great. 10/10.\n\n\nConclusion: I give this game 8/10. I dislike the way to wage war in this game as well as all the cargo ships you end up building in order to transport ressources around. Oh and the slow research. Buy this game if you like sim and strategy games, but don't buy it for the combat system as you WILL be disappointed. I was at least.","June 2, 2012","true","93.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Goldobsidian/recommended/48240/","Goldobsidian","Goldobsidian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Goldobsidian/","209 products in account","**Pro's**\nTons of replay and achevements\nNice graphics\nLow system requirements\nChallanging to play with tons of micromagament\n2 and a half playable factions\n**Con's**\nTons of micromanagement, if you dont like that.\nUplay & DRM\n\n**Detailed walkthrough of experience**\nThe game is beautiful and runs very well on my 9 year old PC with max graphics. Causes a little system lag with other programs but minimizing the game fixes this problem in my experience. Outside of small bugs here and there you will encounter in any game this game runs flawlessly with some of the best pathing AI I have seen. Alot of stuff has to be unlocked though gameplay such as player colors, you start out with 4 or 5 colors and unlock more by playing for specific factions durring missions or free play when you complete achevements or special missions in the name of those factions.\n\nGraphically the world is very alive.... you can see towns foke walking around the streets, cars zipping around, police/fire/ambulances running from their buildings to emergency sites including things like hazmat teams quarenteening a house if an epidemic breaks out or fire coming out of a buildings windows if theirs a fire. The world changes based upon its Eco balance, the higher you get the greener and brighter everything seems, the lower you get the darker and gloomier everything looks. BAsed on gameplay settings the eco balance even has effects on your island, causing things like tornados (negative) or tropical thunder storms (positive).\n\nDLC is so well integrated into the game that you can bairly tell it wasnt a basic function, Im still lost on what some of the DLC is or does cause I bought the game and DLC all at once durring the summer sale. Most of the DLC is cosmetic items, such as fountains and parks that can add varity to how your cities look but is completely optional. Other DLC include technologys you cannot get though base game play such as the Eco Balance building Keeper 1.0, New player/account protrates/colors, a few new units, new missions. The only actual expansion to the game itself how ever is Deep Ocean, It adds a new civilization level to the technology faction, S.A.A.T, as well as new missions, buildings, achevements, technologies, disasters and more. If you buy any DLC Deep ocean is a must.\n\nModules and technology allow for nearly limitless customization, and micromagament can either be a fun or hair pulling experence. Missions are well made and challange you. Even with 100 hours into the game some missions are even still to hard for me to complete.\n\nAll maps are randomly generated based on values you can set in before generating the world. There is even artifacts that can be abled from past civilizations that effect the eco balance positively or negatively to even further add varity and challange to gameplay.\n\n2 and a half factions make this game very replayable, and due to the randomization of every map only more so. Why I say 2 and a half factions is because the 3rd research faction, S.A.A.T, does not have basic construction buildings for things like construction blocks or tools, making it impossible to play on its own. It is a supliment to the other two. Even mixing the basic two factions, Tycoons and Eco Warriors, can have benifits. Spit islands and use mining points for iron and copper and use the Tycoons coal diggers to fuel the smelters to provide Eco Warriors with tools to construct Eco Balance buildings. Thats just a simple example of how using both can come to an advantage.\n\nContinus gameplay is astonishing in this game, unlike most I have seen. You can build a civilization, get some base work done, stock up on some materials, load it all into your arc and leave. Start a new map and use all of that stockpile to quickly build a new civilization and keep going. Technology unlocks from research are account unlocks, meaning if you unlock it its unlocked forever. This does add a bit of a "level cap" of sorts to the game but you can always choose to restart by emptying everything, including technology upgrades from your arc and starting fresh with no help from previous games if you wish to keep playing continus mode. You can disable continus play all togeather in the game options when you make a map. Research how ever unless you disable it in the game options, is perminant, I havent figured out how to reset that other then to make a new account and buy the game again.\n\nI only have 1 comment to make on Uplay. Its useless. I dont mean Uplay itself is usesless, or poorly made, its just not needed, not required. You have to install the game though steam, download Uplay (automatic if you install with steam), make a Uplay account, Update the game. When you launch it from steam, steam launches Uplay then Uplay launches Anno 2070. Its annoying but has never gotten in the way. Steam Ingame overlay works, but you need to readd your friends to Uplays friends list to play online with them less I missed something\n\nOnline play is smooth and challanging in its own right though buyer be ware, DRM on this game is 24/7. BEFORE you panic, the game WILL run if you have launched it once with steam running, but all achements and online play will be disabled if you are playing in offline mode. Because certain things like research unlocks, Ark Storage and the like are bound to your account these will also be disabled. So if your looking to advance in the game your gonna have to be online with a live active connection. On that note, my significant other who uses Wild Blue Satalight internet can play this game online with only a little hickup now and then, in which case the game normally automatically reconnects unlike others. So less you are running dial up or a version air card or something like that, DRM should be the least of your concerns. I Have a DSL connection and I have never once had a connection issue related to this game. Offline play is good if your at a friends house and just want to burn time or at an airport waiting for a plane but not good for long term play unless you dont mind playing one map or starting over repeatedly.\n\nOver all I would give this game a 8 out of 10. Uplay is unneeded and accounts should be stored locally should you get disconnected so when you reconnect you dont have to reload a mission level or lose progress. Outside of that though the game is beautiful, runs fine, never crashed (yet), fun to play with hundreds of hours of play and replay and the randomization keeps everything interesting. I highly recommend this game over any other city/civilization builder. If you read this whole thing, I would like to take a second to thank you for honoring me by doing so even if you do not agree with my assement of the game.","July 2, 2014","true","169.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And this game can provide some time-killing with regards to learning how to build and manage your Oceanic Future theme city.\n\nWhat kills this game for me beyond the first 20 hours is that the AI has unlimited resources and no bases. So you are either building crap an a game where you can't lose, or you are fighting a tough AI that is sending a stream of unlimited warships until you overwhelm them. It's just so lame. I'm not even sure if killing their units matters as it seems like it just triggers them to generate more.\n\nI do want to say though, the GFX and visuals are amazing and I would have loved to play this game for hundreds of hours, but the single player/AI portion is garbage, and the game is a joke in terms of RTS balance/depth to be taken seriously to play on a multiplayer setting.\n\n\nFinally, I am concerned that this game may no longer work one day due to the DRM in it. Connecting to the login server (to play a single player game) is starting to take longer and longer. They will probably be forced to release a DRM-free'ing patch one day when the cost of running the DRM and customer support with that becomes too costly. In the meantime, I have geniune concerns of players being locked out from playing the game because their DRM servers aren't working and they don't seem to care that much.","November 1, 2015","false","47.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I played this game for many hours over a year ago, and I just built a new PC and wanted something to play.  All the new games are too expensive at the moment, so I thought I'd go back to Anno since the new release is coming soon I felt the nostalgia.  Boy, I had forgotten just what garbage Ubisoft is.  The fact that this game is getting mixed reviews is solely based on the horrible experience provided by their lousy uPlay system.  If they are going to release a game through steam, they had better be darned sure that it works.\n\nThat all said, the game itself is great.  If you can get through installing it - and then consequently repairing it and googling around for answers on how to actually make it run, then it's a nice reward.  Just be prepared for a lot of frustration.  You need to be someone who can hunt down problems and fix them, or else you won't even get to start the game.\n\nSo, I'm not actually recommending it since the newer game is coming.  I don't think there is any kind of important back story that you would want to play through before getting the newer game, so it's best to leave this one be.  Hopefully the install and configuration will be worked out in the new game and people can get back to reviewing the actual game and not the terrible company that is producing it.","October 9, 2015","false","862.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

After two separate registration checks (one during installation and one after launching), three rounds of updates (one for vanilla, one for uPlay, and a third for the DLC), and two new profiles (one for uPlay and one linked to uPlay), I really didn't have much of a desire to play Anno 2070 at all.\n\nWhen the game finally did boot up, well, let's just say I was a tad overwhelmed. Immediately, you're subjected to a barrage of notices (senate vote, world council vote, stock market ticker, world conflicts, corporate contracts) all on the main menu. Aside from an expository intro, you're given very little assistance in making sense of it all. Naturally, I decided to start with missions, of which there were several. None of them were labelled "tutorial."\n\nSo, I selected the campaign, assuming it'd begin with/as a tutorial. Much to my dismay, this did not seem to be the case. There were no handy pop-ups, no links to any in-game encyclopedias, no signs of help. Just some busybody executive yelling at me to pick up some supplies. I had no real idea what I was doing and wasn't in the mood to just ♥♥♥♥ around or waste my time floudering, so I quit.\n\nAnd that was my first experience with Anno 2070.
