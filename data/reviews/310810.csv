You control two funny alien engineers who are attached together by a hose and one is fat and one is tiny. By pressing a button you will transfer the air to the other Alien and he will become inflated. Using that mechanic, you will progress through multiple levels trying to get to the exit after activating some device that turns on the exit's teleporter.\n\nThis is very funny! When you switch size it makes a fart noise and there's a show host that comments your good and bad decisions. The color pallette is vivid and the graphics are great.\n\nThe Controls are very easy to get and the more you progress, new mechanics appear that will challenge your brain. There are also leaderboards for each levels to add a little bit of competition with the other players.\n\nThe game can be played solo, local Co-op and online co-op. Couch co-op is very fun and will make you laugh a great deal while online co-op can be a bit frustrating if you team up with a random troll that always switch size just to giggle at the fart noise.\n\nI recommend this game to everyone who loves co-op games, puzzles and quirky humor.","March 4, 2015","true","16.6"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","34","39","0","1"

This game is awesomely fun, but still a challenging puzzle game. Really makes you think outside the box. Love the added challenge of getting the bonus cola bottles. Though a few are still elduing my little Shiftlings.\n\nThe only downside I see is that it doesn't support profiles or reseting progress. So once you have the bottle, you can't reset your profile and try it again. Which greatly reduces replayability value. Unless you wanna try top the time trial boards.\n\n","March 9, 2015","true","44.2"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

At first I was a bit skeptical due to the price and from what i could see there weren't many videos on reviews or gameplay. So we took a gamble and were pleasantly suprised.\n\nThe game offers a nice variety of scenic levels, 5 areas in total from what I can gather, each consisting of 10 levels. We are about halfway through the game and the difficulty is starting to ramp up, but at a nice pace. The puzzles are very well thought out making you really think how to accomplish them. Along side that, the visuals and music are appealing and fit very well.\n\nAll in all I would recommend this, maybe a price drop would help.\n\nTo get our first impressions Check out our Playthough below...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uEJ32BBAs&index=1&list=PLcGeCu7dMAKcotBJBwhFbL7LcTsHh8yNf","March 15, 2015","true","5.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","10","10","2","0"

The controls are strait forward and very simple if you are using a PC controller mastery of the controls is childs play. For me the best part of the game is the commentary and the visuals.\n\nSummed up.\nEasy to play Platformer, Easy to learn controls, Challenging gameplay, Simple to learn mechanics, overall a good time.\nPerfect for anyone wanting to play a co-op game and also have a good time.","March 8, 2015","true","5.3"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

Switches move platforms and doors, blocks can be shoved around by the larger alien, instant-death traps are littered all over the 50+ levels and the level designs make excellent use of providing limitations for movement with a reasonable progression of difficulty as you learn new tricks to get around areas.\n\nThere's an interesting little meta story that goes along with your progression, allowing for an announcer to give commentary as you play through the levels... and there are times that gets a bit irritating, particularly if you're struggling through a difficult section where there'll be a quick quip every time you make a mistake and die, but overall it's pleasant enough.\n\nAs a solo-plyer game, you get to alternate control of each alien, or you can control both simultaneously, both following the same directions and jumping at the same time, and though that makes the timing tricky for some puzzles, its very workable. There is also the option to play co-op, and have each player control a single alien, which makes some things faster, but also more confusing.\n\nLimited replayability for time-attacks or item collection (3 semi-hidden collections per level that you can go back at any time and try to grab if you miss them on the first run-through, They are all findable, but some will require some brain-work to snag), but it's a fairly reasonable length game if you're only planning on a single run-through.","June 24, 2015","true","19.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I highly recomend it, based off my co-op experience. Interesting puzzles, some slight repetitive gameplay, but does get tougher as you progress, but each 'world' offers a different theme, and introduces new puzzle mechanics to keep it fresh enough. Really nice visuals/art style as well.","June 24, 2015","true","10.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
