The game is charming, funny and clever. Animations, musics and voice acting is awesome. Premise of the game is, there are 7 characters and you pick 3 of them at the begining of the game and try to get them out of the cave. Each character has a different story, a unique skill and their own levels. In order to get everyone out of the cave you need to play it at least 3 times. If you want to see everything the game has to offer (there are two endings for each character) you need at least 5 playthroughs. This may sound boring, but puzzle solving in this game is really fun. Also depending on your characters and the items you picked along the way, you can find some shortcuts in some levels.\n\nLong story short, even if you're not a fan of the genre, I say give this game a chance. You will not regret it.","February 4, 2014","true","13.6"," 77 of 86 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","77","86","2","0"

The game needs to be played a minimum of five times through to see every ending for every character, and long, slow ladder-climbing animations sometimes slow sections down to a tedious crawl. There’s a noticeable systematic use of padding to artificially increase playtime, a very obnoxious practice.\n\nThe stories for the individual characters are serviceable but kind of shallow so it’s not really a strong story-telling game. In particular the "good" endings for the characters make little sense and feel like an afterthought, as if they were too skittish to make a game full of nothing but lurid black comedy.\n\nThe reason I still recommend it is that the atmosphere and humor are quite good, so I enjoyed the game despite how sloppy it is in a few places. I wouldn’t advise paying full price for it, though.","December 5, 2015","true","11.8"," 62 of 66 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","62","66","4","0"

A twisted yet charming sense of humor. Quality voice work. Fun puzzles and scenarios that are interesting and just the right difficulty. Several playable characters, each one with their own unique themed level. And despite being limited to 30 FPS, the game still feels quite smooth (much less of a problem than I anticipated).\n\nUnfortunately, it's not without flaws. The controls are very floaty which makes platforming imprecise. The story-telling has its moments but feels a bit shallow at times. Worst of all, because you're tasked with controlling three characters at once, you'll find yourself constantly switching between them and moving them one by one. This gets repetitive very quickly and becomes more of a hassle than anything. Why there was no option to control all three at once is beyond me, but it could've gone a long way towards eliminating the annoying backtracking that hampers the game's pacing.\n\nWhile the game's significant backtracking/pacing issues keep it from being truly great, The Cave still excels at being a fun and humorous adventure game. One that warrants multiple playthroughs if you hope to experience everything it has to offer.","July 10, 2013","true","11.8"," 65 of 74 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","65","74","0","0"

I used to consider myself a Double Fine fan, considering practically every DF title to be an instant purchase. However, I consider their more recent releases to be of much lower quality than I would expect from a developer I admired so. The Cave was the first of these.\n\nFirst off, as a puzzle platformer, most of the puzzles in the game aren't particularly challenging or interesting, often consisting of a simple "find key, open door." Some puzzle mechanics are fun, such as the Time Traveller's ability to alter events in the past to change a level's layout in the future. Mechanics such as these aren't very common, as many of the puzzles are generic so that any character can complete them, likely to avoid conflicts in your party composition.\n\nEvery character has their own backstory which covers how or why they arrived at the titular Cave, but after going through the first couple of characters' levels, you'll notice the common theme pretty quickly and the story exploration becomes uninteresting. It almost feels like an attempt to make "another Psychonauts" by the nature of its writing, with The Cave's backstory exploration echoing similarly to the repressed memories in Psychonauts. However, many may find The Cave's characterization extremely lacking in comparison. Its humor is there but it lacks the quality writing underneath which made other DF titles work so well.\n\nThe Cave tops off its first (very short, no more than 4-5 hour) playthrough with a picture montage (yet again reminiscent of the repressed memories in Psychonauts) and a text notification informing you that you have beaten The Cave, rather than any sort of proper ending. The Cave encourages the player to go through the game at least three times to unveil every character's backstory, with the game not "actually" being beaten until then. Due to the repetition of solving many of the same puzzles across each playthrough, I was not interested in finishing the game a second time. The writing wasn't even interesting enough to convince me to power through the repetition of doing them again.\n\nAll in all, despite its many weak points, The Cave has a few interesting puzzle mechanics that make it worth playing, especially if it can be grabbed for 75% off or more. Unless it's a title you are very interested in, however, I'd avoid it altogether.","November 22, 2014","false","6.4"," 132 of 195 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","132","195","3","0"

Seven adventurers, each with a dark past, go down into a magical cave in a journey of self discovery.  At the beginning of the game (which is narrated throughout by The Cave itself), you choose three of the seven advernturers and descend.  Each section of The Cave is a puzzle that requires your three characters to work together.  Three of the sections are uniquely designed (by the sentient Cave) for the characters you've chosen.  In this way, The Cave encourages you to play though multiple times.\n\nThe drawback is that there's also three generic puzzle sections which you cannot skip.  I'm on my second playthrough, and while it's nice that the game shuffles the order of the puzzles, it can be a drag to re-solve old puzzles to get to new content.  And the achievements require you to play through the game... I don't know how many times, but I imagine The Cave's jokes (while clever) will start to wear thin on the fifth playthrough.  If you really want to get 100% achievements, you might consider reviewing the achievement list online before you play, despite the mild spoilers.\n\nI'd still recommend this game - the humor, art and story make this puzzle game very enjoyable and encourage multiple playthroughs.  May get monotonous if you're looking for all the achievements.\n\nA definite buy if it's on sale.","July 5, 2014","true","9.6"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","35","41","0","0"

I've heard it didn't get the best reviews, but in all honesty, i think they couldn't be more wrong.\n\nYou start your adventure choosing your selection of characters, there is about 7 completely different characters, with different personalities, story lines and lives. All looking to venture through the cave to find something they desire.\n\nYou pick three at a time, so it takes about 3 play throughs to see each story. I found the way you navigate the cave quite clever, your characters can only get into the section that’s for one of the three, so you aren’t dragging yourself through stories for people that aren’t even there.\nThen you have the same in-between puzzles that are the same on each play through. so you do a general puzzle, a characters story, general, story and go on like that until you have reached the end. Where even at the end you have a choice, to change the path of your characters. A sort of, "choose your ending", kind of thing. I didn't notice it at first. So completing it 3 times to see all the characters, then realising you could change the end, i completed it 3 more times. Even though the second 3 times were repetitive, i still enjoyed it a whole lot and didn't get bored.\n\nThe game has a wonderful kind of humour i love seeing in Double Fines games. "The Cave" as you know from the trailer, talks. He’s quite quirky and makes the journey that little more engaging. You can also collect fun little paintings along the way that opens up a little more about the past of your characters; you learn why they are there and what it is they are searching for.\n\nThe puzzles aren’t too difficult, and are somewhat easy to figure out, which personally, i liked. I hate getting stuck on a game, it “throws off my grove”. I only got stuck once, but after a break and a think, i had it. It flowed well for me and i even went as far as to collect all the achievements for the game, which one in particular proves this game has replay ability for me.\n\nAll in all, I loved this game. And I think it’s worth a try, despite what some reviews have said about it. It has great gameplay, nice music/ambient sounds, interesting characters and story lines, fun puzzles and a quirky sense of humour.\nDouble Fine, you've done it again.\n\n\nTL;DR : Fun, several playthroughs worth of replayability, great sense of humour, fun/quite simple puzzles and is worth every penny.","July 4, 2013","true","20.1"," 38 of 46 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","38","46","0","4"

It stands as one of the few games I can think of (the other being Portal 2) that feels like an amusement park attraction. The art is a treat to look at, all the locations are fascinating, the puzzles are neat, the writing is fantastic and the characters are charming. And like the aforementioned Portal 2 and its Aperture Science facility, as you get deeper and deeper into the eponymous Cave, things get stranger and cooler. The game has a constant and satisfying sense of momentum, moving you from set piece to set piece before all arriving at its quaint conclusion.

There is no split-screen or way to view your character while your friend plays theirs, you can only view one at a time. During certain parts of the game it forces you to play a single character for an entire level, leaving any friends you might be playing with to sit and be forced to watch you try and figure it out for the entire duration.\n\nThe levels are also unnecessarily big for what they need to be, leaving you to run around up and down ladders and ropes just to extend the play time.

Use Item A on mechanism B to open the next area. This would not be so bad if you did not have to control three separate characters at one time to pick up only one item and having to traverse a platform -esque dungeon to get to the other side, trying to micromanage where each player must be using some poor platforming and slow movements.\n\nOne of the biggest turn offs to the game is once your first run through is completed you get to go through the game again with another three players but the dungeons and puzzles all stay the same apart from the characters cave segment but with seven characters this means you will have to play the game three times with the last run through having players you have already played before! These short slideshow endings are most definitely not worth it.\nThe dialogue is mildly entertaining, limited and delivered mostly by the narration which  does repeat itself on each replay.\n\nThe game has a lot of charm and character but these alone will not hold up next to poorly implemented game design, mechanics and for a title that is trying to encourage replayabillity it comes off incredibly shallow.","November 25, 2013","false","4.5"," 158 of 260 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","158","260","0","8"

That means the player must play at least 3 times to complete the whole story. And each character has two entirely different endings: bad and happy ending. Hence more tries might be required if the player want to see all the endings. The story exclusive to each specific character is absolutely the essence of this puzzle game.

The Cave is funny (and the Cave's voice is HILARIOUS). It's Ron Gilbert funny, there are so many references, jokes, even the torches on the walls are funny in this game. The gamepad control system works fine, making the game highly enjoyable even on consoles, which is something new for an adventure. Having to choose three characters to descend in the Cave from a pool of seven guarantees a good replayability, since you have to beat the game at least 3 times to explore all the personal sections.\n\nNow the things I didn't like much.

I understand that to take adventure games in the next century we NEED to include new players and not only the hardcore old times fans, but still, I really wanted to get stuck, for old times sake :D and, on a different matter, the Cave as a character IS great, but this gameplay choice (platforming based puzzle solving) completely eliminates dialogue, which was Ron Gilbert's old point and click adventures real added value.\n\nDon't misunderstand me, I LOVED The Cave, but maybe my expectations were too high, I liked to dream about a gamechanging title, while this one is probably a first step, hopefully in the right direction, to really innovate the genre.

Having grown up with so many of his games as a young child it was partly thanks to Mr. Gilbert (amongst other icons from the era) that my love for the medium  blossomed continuing right through to my teens and eventually adulthood. Maniac Mansion was the very first computer game I ever bought with the pocket monies I had earned from doing odd jobs around the family house and I cherished it (although I never completed it nor got very far into it - this being the days of pre-internet where walkthroughs, hints and lets play's were distant and  unimaginable realities). Thanks to a little series known as Monkey Island, featuring an intrepid wanna-be pirate hero named Guybrush Threepwood, Gilbert's name would forever be etched into the far recesses of my game-loving mind and by default become a cause for celebration when releasing something new.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=388072415\nThe Cave, Ron Gilberts latest adventure creation, carries the DNA of both Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island in its veins. Where as his previous game, the Deathspank series, grew tiresome very quickly thanks to a titular hero that loved the sound of his own dumb voice as he rattled off one bad pun or joke too many, The Cave is ghoulishly funny. The Caves core mechanic should be instantly recognizable to anyone who has played Maniac Mansion. Offering seven characters from which you can choose any three to take on a spelunking adventure will determine the kind of adventure you will experience. Each one of the seven characters: an adventurer, scientist, monk, time-traveler, knight, set of twins and hillbilly have their own grim tale for you to uncover by exploring areas of the cave unique to them. Choose the knight and you will need to get the blessing of  marriage from a wayward king's daughters in order to retrieve a sword set in stone or choose the time-traveler and you will encounter a future where you will be required to decode its past in order to unlock its secrets.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=388071977\nDesire and greed are the motivating factors that drives each of these characters forward whether that be the twins plotting to murder their strict no-fun loving Victorian parents or a scientist hellbent on unleashing an atomic bomb into the world despite repeated efforts by npc's and the games narrator that doing so would be catastrophic. Each characters story arc acts as a darkly morbid cautionary tale and for the most part it's funny in a way that elicits giggles even when each character you choose is committing duplicitous acts in order to achieve their wants and needs.\n\nThe Cave plays out like a side-scrolling platformer with adventure/puzzle solving elements and sadly this is where the game struggles to make a lasting impression. Controls are fiddly and many of the puzzles you encounter will require excessive backtracking in order to complete. The Cave also overuses a certain mechanic - the dragging of crates and boxes in order to move the game forward - and it's this overuse that ends up making it feel a bit uninspired and generic in the puzzle solving department. While some of the incorporated puzzles are clever and require some out of the box thinking, too many rely on the lazy mechanic of dragging a box or crate to proceed. The Cave does, however, have a novel approach to replay value because finishing the game with your chosen three characters means you have four more characters each with their own individual areas within the cave to explore.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=388070985\nGilberts black humor does shine through The Cave even when some of the characters selfish tales lack the desired bite that accompanies the darkest of humor. As you progress through The Cave you will need to uncover each characters back-story by unlocking fragments from their past that are hidden deep within the cave itself and it's a pity that each characters tale is uncovered with as little fan-fare as possible. Static background drawings depicting a scene from the life and times of each characters is all you get. It would have been nice to have the narrator, who is the voice of the cave, recount each characters past which would have in turn added more gravitas to their greedy, selfish natures as we witness their slow undoings.\n\nThe Cave attempts to teach its players lessons about the nature of greed and letting one's desires run rampant without a care or thought for others but most of this stuff should already be apparent to all except the heartless, psychotic and pathological of you out there and as a throwback it's an interesting mix of old and new. As a game, The Cave is a bit of a mixed bag that never truly settles into its own identity but even Gilbert on a good (although not great) day is better than no Gilbert at all and while not all of The Cave comes together as planned it still offers up enough juicy adventure gaming goodness to warrant a purchase.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","February 6, 2015","true","9.3"," 58 of 94 people (62%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","62","58","94","4","12"

You choose a combination of 3 out of the 7 characters and descend to the Cave. The Cave features great humor and comedy especially the narration itself. The puzzles are not that challenging. Only two character stories gave me a hard a time. (The Monk and The Time Traveler) Each character story has their own key puzzle part. (meaning a "hard" part of the story) The combination of characters you choose affects your path through the cave but not entirely since there will be parts of your journey where you'll be doing the same puzzle over and over again especially when you tend to miss quite a lot of the collectible Cave paintings. For the whole part, the Cave is a bit short since I'm more indulged in heavy puzzle games making The Cave puzzles not much of a challenge but it's a game worth playing. I recommend this game to anyone who wants to experience a humor and comedy like no other with the addition of great stories and a puzzle platformer gameplay. This price is a bit too high for the game itself so I also highly encourage anyone to buy it when it's on sale, more preferably when it's on a 66% discount or higher.\n\nPros:\n+ Good graphics\n+ Great narration (has a lot of humor)\n+ Has great storylines with their own unique twists (One story per character)\n\nCons:\n+ The puzzles are very repetitive when you want to clear the game with a new set of characters.\n+ The Price is too much for the gameplay itself.\n\nOverall, it's a great game and I totally enjoyed the game and story despite the easy puzzles.","December 19, 2014","true","9.0"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

I was equally frustrated by the game for as much as it charmed me.\n\nThe Cave is a hybrid point-and-click adventure paired with the mechanics of a platformer. You're given a choice of seven characters to choose from (An Adventurer, Knight, Scientist, Time-Traveler, Hillbilly, pair of Twins, and Monk), each of which can change the journey of your playthrough.\n\nThe art design of the game is lovely and the voice work is doubly so. It has that Monkey Island charm that Ron Gilbert is so well-known for and it shows through the many humorous spouts of dialogue from the narrator and various people you meet in the cave. There are lots of little touches that will please even the most picky of gamers and it's in my opinion that the charm of this game is easily one of its strongest components.\n\nThe objective of the game is to discover the backstories of each character through a series of illustrations unlocked by finding symbols on the walls of the cave. At the start of each game you select 3 characters to journey through the cave with, each with a unique level attributed to them. Some are fun, such as the Knight's level in-which you steal an amulet from a dragon and end up destroying the kingdom in the process, but some are just tedious, such as the Adventurer's level, filled with puzzles that give you no indication of how to solve them. Along the way you play through each character's origin story which involves puzzle solving, block pushing, item-using, and so on. It's just such a shame that the endings of each character (of which there are two for each), only involve still pictures and no sort of interactive elements. If you want to get the opposite ending, you have to play through the entire game again with no real changes to the levels. The gameplay of The Cave can best be described as "tedious", and for a game that depends on multiple playthroughs this is a big problem.\n\nSorry Ron, but this adventure just wasn't up to par.","February 7, 2014","false","6.3"," 43 of 69 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","43","69","0","0"

Instead, you are uncovering each character's history and story. The cave somehow transforms into each of the characters stories as you progress through the game. Individual story set-pieces if you will.\n\nIt's a puzzle-platforming adventure game at heart so this means you will be switching between characters and backtracking quite a bit. It does get tiring sometimes and without the backtracking, the game would be much shorter than it already is. Climbing ladders (there's lots of them) becomes a chore and jumping down from higher places only to watch your character fall to their death becomes quite tedious.\n\nThe 7 characters include: A knight, a hillbilly, a scientist, a time traveller, a monk, an adventurer, and a set of twins which counts as one. You'll probably play the game 2 times to get 6 of the character's stories but to get the 7th you would have to play the game the third time and you may not think it's worth it unless you really like the game.\n\nPros  Interactive narrator\nDouble Fine Productions' signature brand of comedy\n7 Characters, each with their own ability\nSense of adventure\nFull controller support\nCons  Short campaign\nAfter you finish the game with all characters, there's no reason to go back\nMost puzzles are way too easy\nLinear level designs, one way to progress, one way to do things\nSupports local co-op but not recommended since the camera only follows one character\nMore to interact with would have been nice\nFinal Thoughts:\nI actually like the game but just because I like it, doesn't mean it will be everyone else's cup of tea. It will only appeal to some people. I expected something different but it didn't turn out too bad. Shame that it's so easy and so short. It's a good puzzle-platformer but it could have been better.

This comes from the ability to only pick up one item per character at a time. So there is no puzzle that requires multiple inventory actions on a single puzzle.\nThe puzzles are also fairly obvious, either way:\n*You need to cheat a "guess your weight" game. You have a barbell and a magician that can turn items invisible to help you.\n*You need to use an elevator, but the fuse is missing, luckily there's a fusebox with a fuse on the other side of the map that doesn't do anything.\n\nNot to mention that the puzzles are padded to increase the length of the game. There's a part where you need your companions to stand on different colored pressure plates while the third navigates a maze. Rather than just doing it once or twice to demonstrate that you understand the mechanics, you have to do it half a dozen times. The worse is a mansion themed level which is 4 stories tall and you constantly have to run up and down the halls to complethete it.\n\nAdditionally, the puzzles have similar solutions. This one is especially heinous. There are a total of 13 levels in the game and 7 of them are character specific while the others are generalized. Of those 6 general levels 2 of them have no puzzles. On top of that, the last 2 generalized levels have the exact same solution which involves tricking an NPC with a tape recorder. This is inexcusable and really shows they were running out of ideas.\n\nSpeaking of levels, when you enter character specific levels, your other two members become dead weight except for occassionally weighing down other objects. In the mansion themed level, your other two party members can't even be used. To make matters worse, there's a mine themed level where you need to navigate 3 levles of labyrinth like mazes, which is fairly time consuming. The catch is that every time you complete the puzzle on one of these levels, you need to individually walk each of the 3 members up to the next level and insert them in the puzzle. Its frustrating, time consuming, and only serves to pad the game.\n\nLuckily, the environment and style are pretty good and 2 of the NPCs are even charming.\n\nFinally, the game has no replay value, despite requiring a minimum of 5 replays to get all 14 endings. The puzzles are even easier once you know the solution, there's no reason to speed run, so you play the entire game again just to find out the "good" or "bad" ending for a character, which becomes pretty obvious before you even get it.\n*No replay value, but many replays.  To make matters worse, with a group of 3 comprised from 7 characters, you're 3rd play, you'll only be expericing 1 new level.\n\nFor all of these reasons, I cannot recommend The Cave, even though there were parts that I liked.","January 5","false","6.3"," 29 of 44 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","29","44","0","0"

This provides some level of replayability.\n\n+ The levels themselves are fun to play and each one provides its own unique puzzles to solve which makes the game interesting.\n\n+Nice graphical art style\n\n+ Game controls nicely with gamepad\n\nThe Average\n\nLike most games that focus on humor, the dialogue can be very hit or miss.\n\nIt can be a short game if you don't bother to replay it with the other characters.\n\n\nThe Bad\n\n- Because you have to switch between 3 characters to solve the puzzles in the game, this creates a lot of needless backtracking. A lot of the puzzles themselves revolve around you going to one side of the map picking up an item and having to go back to the other side. Over time this starts become very tedious.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is a very charming game, something you would normally expect from Ron Gilbert and Double Fine.

You choose 3 out of 7 characters, who all come with their unique abilities, background story and areas. You move around by climbing ladders and ropes. There are common areas where you need all three characters to solve the puzzles and specific character areas that need the respective character's ability to be solved.\n\nThe puzzles are stupidly hard, I played this game with my partner, and we couldn't of finished it without the aid of the walkthrough. You would need some very critical thinking in order to get past the second level without some sort of guide.\n\nAs this was my partners first proper PC game she had played, apart from Sims and WoW, I think it did a very good job of introducing different game mechanics for people who haven't even played this sort of game before.\n\nThis title is not very linear, which will catch many modern gamers by surprise, who are used to heavy handed scripted playing. The humor is dark and entertaining, so are the individual stories behind the characters. The art and mood is amazing in here too.\n\nThe annoying part of the game is that you often at times have to walk back and forth to solve puzzles, which is compounded by the fact that you sometimes need to move three characters to a specific location. A character summon function would have been handy here. But that doesn't ruin an excellent gaming experience for a low price.\n\nI hope the younger gamers will appreciate it despite the lack of heavy scripting from newer games. We both thoroughly enjoyed the game, but like I said, without the aid of a walkthrough, I fear there may of been an argument at times at deciding which way to do the puzzle!\n\nCheck out more reviews on http://completingthebacklog.blogspot.co.uk/","January 15, 2014","true","3.9"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","22","34","0","0"

However, afterwards is where it falls flat.\n\nThe game provides you with 7 heroes, each with a different story. Your first playthrough, you can complete 3.

It has a good sense of humor, even though some of it is hit-and-miss. It also does a decent job at managing the multiple stories. You'll be playing with 3 (out of 7) characters at the same time, all with their own story. As a result there's also a bit of replay value there for those who absolutely enjoyed it all the way through.\n\nAnd while I liked it there were still a few things that bothered me. The first and most obvious are the blurry graphics. Yes, it uses a certain style, but it was still below my expectations. It's nothing groundbreaking, not as a game or an engine, so I expected better here. The characters are well animated though. It reminded me of something... I can't quite put my finger on it. But I do know is that I've seen this animation style before.\n\nThe puzzles are actually pretty decent and require some thinking. I had to use a walkthrough more than once. You see, I'm not that bright ;) And except for The Walking Dead (which isn't really a traditional adventure anyway), (point-and-click) adventures usually aren't my cup of tea.\nSo forgive me if I say that I won't be playing it again with any of the other characters. One playthrough was more than enough for me. Like I said, it's a good game, but nothing extraordinary.\n\nBut, you might have an other opinion if you're a die hard adventure player, of course. I myself expected better from a studio that brought us the brilliant Brutal Legend, Psychonauts, Stacking and Costume Quest. You're better off playing any one of those.\n\n[Rating: 71/100]","February 9, 2013","true","4.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Even if you choose different characters, you WILL have to replay a few multiple times (even more if you want to see the alternate endings), so it gets extremely repetitive.","December 17, 2013","true","17.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Graphics, Voice Acting, Story and Writing are all good. No real dialogue apart from the narration.

Basically for each playthrough you choose 3 of the 7 available characters each with their own short chapter (the other two characters just tag along as deadweight when they are not in their chapter).\n\nPuzzles are relatively straightforward and require a lot of back and forth across the maps (probably why we don't see more 2d adventure game platformers). Trine 1 & 2 do everything The Cave does better (and Trine has combat too). But if you want more Trine, or just a simple puzzle platformer, then The Cave is a good adventure.\n\nGet it only on sale.","November 29, 2013","true","4.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/b-rom/recommended/221810/","b-rom","b-rom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/b-rom/","477 products in account","I have an opinion on the The Cave, but I'm having a hard time deciding exactly what it is.  It isn't a bad game, but it's quite a long ways from perfect.  If I were a teacher and The Cave was an assignment somebody had handed in, I would give it a passing grade, but it certainly wouldn't get a very high mark.\n\nHaving said that, I seem to have put a fair amount of time into it, and I do plan on finishing off the rest of the acheivements.  So there is something to be said about it.\n\nAt its heart The Cave is a puzzle based adventure game.  The controls are simple enough, and it's rare that you need to do anything particularly precise with them.  You control three characters, each with their own story and one special ability that generally acts as a key to their area that other characters can't access.  So every time you play you pass by the spots where a given character's story is to be told, and if that character is in your group you can go in, if not you carry on past.\n\nEach area is a collection of puzzles.  Some you can solve with one of the characters, some require you to position multiple characters and perform actions nearly simultaneously from across the map.  You never need to aim at anything, and there isn't any combat as such.  There is one logic / math sort of puzzle, but they have a way of getting the solution if you can't figure it out.  In all honesty, I found that puzzle a lot more clear than many of the puzzles in this game.  There is a lot of your typical adventure-game-logic where you need to think outside the box to come to the solution.  The "box" in the last sentence would refer to normal human experiences and behaviour.  So, to use a hypothetical example, you might be required to use a slice of bread to open a door to keep your finger-prints off of it.  Something you probably wouldn't think of otherwise.\n\nSo what does The Cave have going for it?  Well, the puzzles are generally fun, the narration is pretty much top notch, and it was nice to see the adventure game format return.  The story was pretty good, and while I have criticisms of it, they tend to be nit-picky sort of things.  A slight inconsistency of tone here, a lack of sympathetic character there.\n\nThe fun part of this though is what The Cave does wrong.  The number one thing, and this is a glaring issue from my perspective, is the repetition.  This game repeats its repititions.  It has loops inside loops.  I can't believe anybody would develop a game with this much repitition in it.  Have I said repitition too many times yet?  If you think so, you're going to get very annoyed at The Cave very quickly.\n\nRight off the bat there are seven characters, seven stories, and you can only have three characters in your group at a time.  If you can follow along with my advanced calculus, that means that in order to see every character's story, you will need to play the game to completion a minimum of three times and repeat two characters.  In addition, each play through has you puzzle your way through six areas.  Three that are character story dependent, and three that are there every time.  The puzzles never change anywhere, so if you play through the game the minimum number of times to see each character's story, you will still have those three sections mastered.But that's not all.  Each character has two possible endings.  So if you want to see the entire story for any given character, you need to play through twice, and the only difference is one decision right at the end.\n\nMoving away from the repitition, this is one of the buggiest games I have played in a long time.  It's not that uncommon, especially for a PC gamer, to see a game that crashes from time to time, or that has one specific graphics glitch.  The Cave is constantly tripping up, failing in some weird way or just acting funny.  It's like they didn't play test it all that much.  For instance, there are many places where you need to stand beside an object, like a crate or something, and push it around.  Well, frequently when you try and do so the character will start jittering around instead of pushing.  On one occasion I jumped a character onto the bottom step of a porch only to have her ghost through the step so she was standing inside it.  It took some doing to find the right set of moves to get her unstuck.  I've had the game just decide to stop listening to the keyboard (except for the escape key interestingly).  After my first time playing I quit the game and when I started it back up again, it had lost my saves and any connection to steam.  No acheivements rang in, I couldn't access the steam overlay, nothing.  But every other game worked fine with steam.  The next time I started the game, steam was back again, and any progress I had made in the intervening session was lost.\n\nAll in all I do recommend this game, but I do so with a lot of hesitation.  There's fun to be had here, and I do enjoy playing it, but at the same time it really isn't very polished.  If you have no other games that you want to play, and some money burning a hole in your pocket, then this might be a decent way to spend some time.  However, if you have other titles that you are interested in, pick them up first.","November 30, 2013","true","20.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have played it through six times now to get all the achievements and loved it each time. You pick three characters for each play through, each character has its unique level and there are some common levels. The puzzles and fun and satisfying, humour is great and the style is nice. There are a few little complaints you could make. Since each play through has the same common levels you end up doing those repeatedly but I didn't mind as they are fun. It is a little odd playing it with two people as you have to control three characters and end up stealing control from each other accidentally but that is not too bad once you get used to it. The only thing that did bother me is that each character has two endings and the way to get the good ending is completely not obvious, I would not have even known there was a good ending if I hadn't seen the Zero Punctuation review beforehand.

There are no tasking platforming elements, which is great since there is quite a bit of backtracking involved. The puzzles are simple and amount to little more than scouring the area for items whose purpose is usually easy to sort out, or arranging your characters so that they 'work together' to solve a puzzle. This generally means that most of the game's content is in travelling and taking in the sights rather than elaborate puzzles and dialogue trees, which is good only if you're expecting this.\n\nThere are two main highlights for me: the narration by the Cave itself, and the surprisingly dark storylines of each of the 7 characters. The characters themselves have subtle personality, even though they don't have any dialogue. Each character's area is well designed and wonderful to experience, and made me want to play through each person's story.\n\nI'd recommend this game for people who enjoy a slower paced game, who like to soak in atmosphere and interesting stories, and who aren't looking for a particularly difficult challenge.","December 20, 2013","true","7.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They range from very simple to relatively puzzling, but generally you can figure each one out with a few minutes of lateral thinking. If you're stuck, there's plenty of guides out there too.\n\nThe heart of this game isn't about the puzzles, however. The quirky, dark humour and the metaphor that emerges as you delve deeper drive you forward. The Cave is more than just a puzzle game, it holds a message that moves the game closer to being a piece of art.","January 26, 2013","true","14.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This means that you can have 2 completely unique playthroughs, but then if you want to see the 7th character's storyline you'll have to do a third playthrough with mostly repeated content.\n\nSecond, I feel like this game would have benefitted from more voice acting, although I understand this might have been due to budget restrictions, but if it was a stylistic choice then I just don't get it.\n\nThe characters you play as are supposed to have these big dark backstories that you uncover, but there's never any opportunities to show their personalities, even when I was playing as particular characters I felt like the story that was being revealed was for NPCs not the characters I was controlling. I think this could have been showed off more through voice acting.\n\nHowever, the game is still very charming. You're led through the game by The Cave itself, an omniscient narrator who has a dry sense of humor as he details all of your experiences. It's actually pretty fun. In addition, there's quite a lot to like about many of the levels, especially the ones that are specific to certain characters. The hillbilly's carnival level in particular was  a lot of fun.\n\nThe games not very challenging. If you're paying attention most puzzles are pretty easy. However, there are certain parts that seem to drag on.\n\nIt's definitely not perfect, but overall I think it's a decent game, although the writing isn't quite up to what I expect from Double Fine.","September 6, 2015","true","7.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For example the characters jump several seconds AFTER you hit the jump button, and they will often run on after you release the arrow key (so if you want/need them to stand in an exact location, forget the keyboard and just use the mouse).\n\nThis can make certain puzzles a struggle too, since even after you've worked out what to do, actually completing the puzzle is made even more difficult due to the above control issue, and on several areas where you have to do a lot of difficult jumping and climbing make one mistake and you have to do the entire puzzle all over again, the under/over reactive controls can be adjusted to, but still make some areas a lot harder than they should be.\n\nThat said this game has plenty of charm, character, a good re playability value, and the narration can be genuinely funny. The controls may work better with a controller rather than the keyboard (I haven't got one to test it out). .

To me, it is definently worth playing through with every character and even playing through twich with each one to see both the good and the bad endings.  Every character has their own masterfully crafted level.  The only level I would complain even a little about is one of the "in-between" levels about the miner.  Other than that, every level is packed with personality and very clever puzzles. (My personal favorite level was the Hillbilly's, but they are all fantastic)  The writing in this game is some of the best dark humor I have come across.  The narration done by the cave itself is extremely well written and the voice acting is just as great.  I have read some reveiws where the game was lambasted for "excessive back-tracking".  I really have to disagree with that as (with the exception of the miner level) back tracking is usually not more that 10-15 seconds as you travel between puzzle hotspots.  The complaints I read about this seemed really exageratted to me and shouldn't be a turn off to anyone wanting to play this game.

It wasn't everything I hoped for (it wasn't that genre of game brought back to life) but it is a solid game.\n\nThe game focuses primarily on using more than one character to solve a puzzle, and how you solve a puzzle may depend on what three characters you select at the beginning.  There is a story to each character and every character comes with an extra level of their own to find a solution to.   I've played through once and I'll definitey be playing through again with the other characters.\n\nSo it's got a few tricks that were in Maniac Mansion, a similarly grim sense of humour and the obligatory references (keep an eye open for Chuck the Plant!), but it's a lot more linear than Maniac Mansion (definite level progression, not so much exploring one large setting) and characters can only hold one item at a time (no amassing large quantities of stuff and trying to work out things to do with them).

Launch nuclear warheads for fun and profit! Kill your coworker to become Employee of All Time! Become the Karma master by ensuring that the current holder of the title isn't around to claim it! Be a Billhilly!\n\nThe Cave allows you to play as three of seven unique characters, each with their own mannerisms and animations. As you descend the depths of The Cave, you'll have to utilize their abilities to conquer whatever bizarre challenge lies in the way leading up to their own personal section of The Cave where your "hero" is perfectly willing to show how far he/she is willing to go to obtain his/her goals.\n\nA typical playthrough will take about 3 or 4 hours, even if you don't know what you're doing. There's a lot of backtracking and out-of-the-box thinking, akin to Adventure games, and there are some platforming segments but they're hardly difficult since dying doesn't change a thing. If you don't mind the backtracking, wait until your second or third playthrough (since there are seven characters and you can only take three at a time. You'd be crazy not to experience the story of every character). It didn't bother me at all and - let's face it - a lot of games these days have backtracking, even on a larger scale than this. Only the third playthrough will tire on you unless you pick your two favorite characters to accompany the last guy since four sections of The Cave will always remain the same no matter which characters you pick.\n\nThe game really isn't difficult or mentally taxing but it isn't very long either, which can be a good thing. So I recommend this game to anyone, just as long as the repetion and lack of action doesn't throttle you and you can stomach doing something evil.

You pick three of the seven characters at the start to play through set stages combined with character specific stages, both of which optimise on the characters abilities. I must have finished this over six times to get all of the good and bad endings, collectables and achievements and it did not turn repetitive, if anything it felt like a speed run after learning everything. The Cave himself and the events inside have some good humour which goes well with all the evil deeds being performed. The game is best played with three players but it isn't a hindrance if you play through alone, just bear in mind this game if you ever have bored friends over.","February 8, 2013","true","18.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Was expecting puzzles to exploit the game's gimmick - that you bring three characters along, and each has their own ability.  Unfortunately, while the puzzles are clever, they're more to do with using items in clever ways than using the character abilities (except for each character-specific area, where their tale unfolds).\n\nStill, for what it is, and the price, it's a fun game and worth the money.  Great sense of humor and interesting story for each character.

The game is fun. It reminds me of a blend of Limbo and Trine. The puzzles aren't too hard, but there are some really good ones in there that had me stumped for a while. There are seven characters to choose from, but only three can be chosen for each run thru the game. To see the whole game, it will need to be finished at least twice. I did complete all the character-specific levels. The Scientist and the Time Traveler levels were my favorites. They were all good, though, except for possibly the level for The Monk. It was too short and too easy. It was still ok tho. There are several sections that are a part of every run-through regardless of the characters chosen. The writing is funny and the voice acting is really well done. It took about 12 or so hours to see all of the game. The art style is cartoony and pleasant. The graphics are serviceable, but nothing special. The first time dynamite blew up, the explosion crashed the game. Other than that, it ran flawlessly at a smooth 60fps throughout. My biggest gripe with the game is the amount of back tracking. There is so much back-and-worth when trying to figure out the puzzles for the first time and climbing ropes takes forever. It's not a huge deal, but its something that's ever present.

If you're a fan of Ron Gilbert or the Team at Double Fine then you probably already own this, but for everyone else this game rides the line of adventure/platformer way over on the adventure side.

The evil ending is the basic ending built into the game, but I haven't figured out how to unlock a happy ending yet.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkStarSword/recommended/221810/","DarkStarSword","DarkStarSword","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkStarSword/","853 products in account","The puzzles in this game are not all that bad - they are in fact the game's one *and only* strength.\n\nOn the other hand, the puzzles could have been a lot better - they could have been designed with multiple solutions using various character specific abilities that would make you feel really clever to figure out the different ways to solve them. They could have, but they didn't. What a waste.\n\nWhen there were multiple solutions, they too were just lame. There's one point where the scientist can use her 1337 hacking skillz to open a door... or, you could just pull the lever right next to it. Another where the Adventurer can grapple over a pit of spikes... that she could have just jumped over. When you can do something profoundly different (like using the Monk's telekinesis to obtain a guarded item early, or carry an extra hotdog with you for 3/4 of the game to shortcut a later puzzle), it felt more like an exploit of a poorly thought out level design rather than something sneaky you could do as a deliberate design decision by the writer.\n\nThe writing in this game is just bad - it's clearly trying to be funny, but I don't think I even smiled once while playing, and I certainly didn't laugh. The Cave is sentient and provides a narrative voice, but the voice actor simply reads the jokes off the script in an almost monotonic voice with no emotion whatsoever. The other voice actors aren't much better, but really the problem is that the script is just lame and didn't really give them any room to shine.\n\nThe story reminds me of the type of work I'd have submitted for high school English (if not worse) - in my mind I could create really interesting characters, with a dark unsettling past that I'd put together in an unusual and interesting setting and have some event spiral out of control of the characters, bringing their best and worst traits out as they had to reluctantly work together to overcome... yeah, what I wrote on the paper was little more than a Star Trek rip off.\n\nI can tell that in the writers mind he had developed seven really interesting characters with a dark past that are going to commit some terrible atrocity in the cave - unfortunately the game fails to develop any kind of connection to the characters and we feel absolutely nothing for the characters and no remorse for the evil deed that they do.\n\nI'm not nuking the Earth as the Scientist because the game has developed a connection with her and I can see that she believes that it is really her last option to eliminate an oppressive government that only pretends to listen to it's intellectuals as a facade so they can continue pretending that planting a few trees will solve climate change and that dumping three million cubic metres of mining dredge spoil on the Great Barrier Reef won't have any adverse affects (spoiler: it's not actually that interesting, she just wants money).\n\nNo, I'm simply turning the three launch keys because it's the only way the game will let me progress.\n\nThe game has good & bad endings for each of the characters, but they boil down to a single choice at the end of the game to take a souvenir (bad ending), or return it to the gift shop (good ending) - that's just lame (as are the chalkboard endings), and it doesn't even let you save before the decision to see the other ending without playing through the entire game AGAIN (MINIMUM FIVE PLAYTHROUGHS TO SEE ALL THE ENDINGS - what a waste of time). They could have had the bad ending be the easy solution to the character specific puzzles (e.g. launch the nuke) and the good ending be a much harder alternate solution to the same puzzle (perhaps the Scientist could have found a way to trick the bad guy with the money into giving the warhead a push because it was "stuck", then swap the warhead with him and launch it into the ocean - the world is saved and she still gets rich), but no, it's just more wasted potential.\n\nAnd speaking of time wasting, can Ron Gilbert please get off his pretentious butt and stop padding his games (which he has done since the Monkey Island games - but at least they had good writing to carry them through) and wasting players time with unskippable cutscenes and forcing multiple playthroughs (THREE MINIMUM) just to play all the puzzles, and even more playthroughs (FIVE MINIMUM) to see all the different endings. And each of those playthroughs requires you to sit through those same unskippable cutscenes again (they aren't very long, but once I've seen them once I really don't care to watch them again, what with the terrible writing and wasting time and all), as well as play a bunch of common puzzles again - not difficult, just a complete and utter waste of time. There is absolutely no reason why the game couldn't have let you take all seven characters on the one playthrough and play all the puzzles (perhaps selecting three for each puzzle or section).\n\n\nIf you want an interesting platformer with multiple characters and a good story, go play Trine. It's puzzles aren't as good as The Cave, but it is a much better game overall.\n\nIf you want a point and click puzzle/adventure game with multiple characters and some really good wit and humour, go play The Book of Unwritten Tales. There are tonnes of really good adventure games coming out these days, just not from the industry "veterans".\n\nAnd, for the love of God can we please stop throwing money at Double Fine on kickstarter? We're as bad as the big name publishers, thinking that they will make good games because just because they had a couple of hits in the past!","February 2, 2014","false","12.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

The Ron Gilbert name--man behind legendary games Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion-- followed by the Double Fine logo and promotional material (mainly the character trailers) got me to invest in this hybrid game of platforming and item collecting and witty antics that are a staple of adventure games. The Cave fails to capitalize on any strengths of its genres.\n\nPlatforming is not fun. The game never tries to make jumping fun or innovative. Most envoirments are just elaborate corridors with road blocks disguised as puzzles at best and "match with the best character's 'get out of jail free power'" at its worst. It never comes close to mimick a traditional platformer. Platforming here is padding to get to the next vender for keys and their doors. The game never challenges your relfex skills, but that's okay because movement is terrible; floaty physics and hit detection, followed by falling death, and it's too simple to die from fall damage. It doesn't take much distance to make vertical space deadly, and you will die because you want to go through areas as fast a possible. Dying makes you respawn, but that can either net closer t your destination or back to redo your mistake again.\n\nMany puzzles revolve around fetching things and making Player Characters (PCs) stand around. You must move each inividual character by controling him or her; there is no way to make the other two characters follow your selected spelunker. The games tries to mediate by having them warp to your controled person on selected events, but it's annoying when a certain puzzle requires two PCs and your nearest comrade is meters away. Multiplyer makes you share the screen. That's bad.\n\nThe biggest problem is the characters, or lack thereof. The game already hints at a "dark, terrible secret" in each persona. While it's not a requirement for characters in a story to be likable, they have to be interesting. They are not interesting. None of the PCs talk, only the Cave and minor charactors do. PCs do not attempt to express themselves in other ways. They do not react in in-fame cut-scenes or express any emotion besides waiting, pushing things, and dying. Wall paintings barely flesh out their backstories, but not enough to characterize.\n\nThe humor is good. The Cave's monologues are the highlight, and one-liners from other characters are clever, but it's not enough to trench through the along mediocre gameplay and level design.","February 18, 2013","false","4.9"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","1"

The problem with not having all that much money but having way too much time on my hands as a child. That's first world problems for you.\n\nI'm not going to say it's for everyone, though. The humor is rather dry and often at least a little bit macabre (the twins, for instance) but if you like dark humor (which I love) this game will at least be fun for that.\n\nThere are a few problems. There are some odd glitches every now and again, though they are not all that frequent (unless you're doing the no deaths runthrough, when every deadly glitch rears its ugly head). The biggest problem is that you can't skip any of the cutscenes or dialogue. Don't get me wrong, both are superb in this game (I'm pretty sure Grey DeLisle voices at least one of them, too) but since this is a game that relies on multiple playthroughs, the skip feature really should have been included. I mean, trying to do the no deaths playthrough alone will probably have you just leaving the room on occasion to do other things while you wait.\n\nSaying all that, this game is just too much fun to pass up. It's worth the price and if it's on sale, doubly so.

They are: The Knight; The Cientist; The Adventurer; The Twins; The Monk; The Time Traveler; and The Hillbilly. You'll be taken on a journey to find what they desire most and what they would do to get it. The cave is divided into seven character themed stages and three unchangable stages that are interconnected. So whenever you play you'll go through three stages based on each of the characters you choose at the start and three that will aways be the same. The Cave is filled with puzzles, interesting stories and a funny narrator. The only problem I have with the game is the fact that to play with three new characters I had to go through the other three unchangable levels and there was still one character left to play with, but this one I watched on Youtube. Overall the puzzles are really good, but some are better than others. I would recommend you to play with the Cientist, the Time Traveler and the Hillbilly, because they have the best stages. Then play with the Adventurer, the Twins and the Monk, which are ok. The Knight has the worst stage, but it is on the start of the cave so you can easily play it as the last character and then watch his endings on Youtube.","January 14, 2014","true","8.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Well, despite having solved all the main puzzles in the game I bothered to unlock both endings for all the characters, so that says something.\n\nOn the bad side, "The Cave" is plagued by various bugs (keyboard suddenly not responding, and the keyboard controls actually being outright broken for one of the Monk's puzzles) that require restarting the game, and there is a woeful lack of ability to skip the cutscenes as far as I know (or the method to skip the cutscenes wasn't included in the meger in-game instruction).\n\nIt's an interesting concept with various nice touches.  The puzzles aren't too difficult for veterens of the genre, but most of the character special abilities are of limited use outside their own special sequences.\n\nStorywise -- and in adventure games, this does matter -- it's one of those tales that is layered with room for reflection.  In a change of pace for the genre, the "Good" endings are the alternative endings (which I discovered in a most cinematic way, dawning on me shortly before point of no return, mimicing the whole touching Hollywood moment) and some routes create an equally satsifying story, depending on character.  The presentation of characters like The Twins contrasted by characters like The Adventurer make you wonder if the adventure in The Cave is a warning, a reflection, or a second shot at redemption (or all three).\n\nIn closing, The Cave's strengths lie in its concept, puzzles and story where its weaknesses are the graphics, controls and various bugs that while aren't crippling are definitely annoying.","December 28, 2013","true","17.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You will want to play through this game more than once just so you can experience all of the characters and collect their cave paintings and endings.\n\nThis leads into where the game comes up short.

The four mandatory dungeons are the gift shop [extremely tedious], the mines [extremely tedious], the zoo [a little tedious (can be skipped by bringing a hotdog from the gift shop)], and the island [pretty tedious].\nThe mandatory dungeons are tedious enough the first time, the prospect of having to go through them again may be enough to dissuade you from replaying the game.\nHere is how you complete the gift shop (tutorial) dungeon so you know what I'm talking about: Walk all the way to the end, grab a crank, walk all the way back, use crank on well, grab bucket, walk all the way to the end, place bucket, grab fuse, walk all the way back, place fuse, grab hotdog, walk all the way to the end, place hotdog, with a second character grab fuse, walk all the way to the end, replace fuse.\nThen there is the fact that the "sultry and mysterious" intro along with all character interactions are unskippable. You will spend a bit of time listening to speeches you have already heard before you can move on if you choose to replay this.\n\nThis next part isn't so much a con, it's what makes what I said above so bad though. Each of the seven characters has two endings; a good and a bad. You can only see one per playthrough so if you want to experience all fourteen endings you will have to play through the game at least five times.\n\nIt may seem like I'm really ragging on this game, but it is very enjoyable and you will probably have a ton of fun with it, even if you choose to replay it (a couple times).\nHowever, if you have a short attention span or dislike doing the same thing two or more times this might not be the game for you.","January 29, 2013","true","13.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

They are: The Knight; The Cientist; The Adventurer; The Twins; The Monk; The Time Traveler; and The Hillbilly. You'll be taken on a journey to find what they desire most and what they would do to get it. The cave is divided into seven character themed stages and three unchangable stages that are interconnected. So whenever you play you'll go through three stages based on each of the characters you choose at the start and three that will aways be the same. The Cave is filled with puzzles, interesting stories and a funny narrator. The only problem I have with the game is the fact that to play with three new characters I had to go through the other three unchangable levels and there was still one character left to play with, but this one I watched on Youtube. Overall the puzzles are really good, but some are better than others. I would recommend you to play with the Cientist, the Time Traveler and the Hillbilly, because they have the best stages. Then play with the Adventurer, the Twins and the Monk, which are ok. The Knight has the worst stage, but it is on the start of the cave so you can easily play it as the last character and then watch his endings on Youtube.","January 14, 2014","true","8.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Well, despite having solved all the main puzzles in the game I bothered to unlock both endings for all the characters, so that says something.\n\nOn the bad side, "The Cave" is plagued by various bugs (keyboard suddenly not responding, and the keyboard controls actually being outright broken for one of the Monk's puzzles) that require restarting the game, and there is a woeful lack of ability to skip the cutscenes as far as I know (or the method to skip the cutscenes wasn't included in the meger in-game instruction).\n\nIt's an interesting concept with various nice touches.  The puzzles aren't too difficult for veterens of the genre, but most of the character special abilities are of limited use outside their own special sequences.\n\nStorywise -- and in adventure games, this does matter -- it's one of those tales that is layered with room for reflection.  In a change of pace for the genre, the "Good" endings are the alternative endings (which I discovered in a most cinematic way, dawning on me shortly before point of no return, mimicing the whole touching Hollywood moment) and some routes create an equally satsifying story, depending on character.  The presentation of characters like The Twins contrasted by characters like The Adventurer make you wonder if the adventure in The Cave is a warning, a reflection, or a second shot at redemption (or all three).\n\nIn closing, The Cave's strengths lie in its concept, puzzles and story where its weaknesses are the graphics, controls and various bugs that while aren't crippling are definitely annoying.","December 28, 2013","true","17.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is a side scroller point&click, the controls are legacy of both genres and you will have no problem getting into it whether you are more comfortable with one or the other genre.\n\nI personally like Point&Clicks and the idea of The Cave in general, everything is fine, descent ambiance, good story-telling (Stunning narrator voice).\n\nThe game is built around several characters, you will choose three characters for each of your run, and go through The Cave that will lead to different path depending on which characters you choose.\n\nThe problem is that half of a The Cave run is the same, regardless of which character you choose. The number of character available isn't a multiple of three (That means that you will have to go through the path of two characters two times). That completely breaks apart the idea of a replayable game, because you basically have to go through the same content several time to get the new content (Which is annoying and pointless in a point & click game, it's a repetitive mindboggling grind).\n\nIf you have the time and patience (I am usually really patient, and I have a lot of time for games, though I hadn't enough) You will probably enjoy all the content of the game, and be really happy with it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jkflesh/recommended/221810/","jkflesh","Richard Whitman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jkflesh/","372 products in account","Many, if not all, cultural phenomena can be traced back successfully to a point of origin, something that Hunter S. Thompson would call a “long fine flash“ condensing the energy of an entire generation, ushering forward the new and unexpected. For adventure games that point was late 80s and the reason was Ron Gilbert with his crew at LucasArts. When the team was busy laying the foundations of an entire genre with Maniac Mansion, my parents were still enjoying a carefree and childless life so, unfortunately, I have missed what some consider the golden era of point-and-click adventure games. Even later on, my path has rarely crossed with the classics, being a primarily console gamer and all, but finally the genre has caught up to me and sparked my interest like not many do (maybe it was the top hat). Finally, upon seeing the trailer for The Cave, the title that Ron Gilbert was returning to adventure games, I knew that fate was giving me a chance to confront the past of the genre and maybe even the future. After finishing the game I’m pretty sure I saw neither.\n\nThe game starts with the player being greeted by the titular Cave, who will also be the narrator further on, and being given a choice of 3 out of 7 distinct characters with vague names such as The Scientist, The Adventurer, The Monk and so on. Each of the characters not only has a unique ability to them but also an exclusive storyline. Quite soon you will realize that the narration is something different from what we are accustomed to – none of the characters, except the Cave, have any dialogue and their past is discovered by the player in comic book-like pages that are plastered on the walls with an occasional nod or hint from the omniscient narrator. The Cave offers a rather rarely seen exposition by gameplay where you unravel the mysteries by your own actions – and most of them are not what would be generally considered “nice”. You accidentally murder people on your quest to get the treasure, push the switch or any other achievement-trope you can think off which generates an unique feeling of dread of what will the next area and next puzzle bring. The pinnacle of suspense is by far the campaign for The Twins, which presents us with two children determined to break away from their over-loving parents – at all costs (think of Tim Burton when his creative juices were still running). It is easy to spoil what happens in The Cave so I will not go into further details as the stories presented are not exactly complex, yet they somehow latch on to you, as every parable should.\n\nThe gameplay is broken into 6 areas – 3 unique to their characters interwoven with 3 more general with everybody in your team taking part in the action. As you go further down, the spelunking will take you from an old mine through a monster-infested route up to an isolated island whose only residents are an old hermit, his parrot and his dog (hilarity ensues). The puzzles contained within the sectors, while not very creative or fresh, flow naturally from one to another and very rarely do you feel like your path is being artificially blocked. When you leave the island you have seen the worst side of your back-stabbing, money-grubbing, fame-craving team and you are ready for a catharsis, a moment where you can make all wrongs into rights and somehow redeem your ensemble. Unfortunately, you are thrown to the entrance of the Cave where you uncover the last page of the comic book. The game ends.\n\nWith 4 hours on the clock you feel cheated, not only by the game time (you still have other characters to play after all) but by the lack of resolution. After all you have went through, it feels like the game-creators have thrown the towel in mid-sentence and called it quits, leaving the player yearning for a proper ending to a story they have witnessed. With each next playthrough the feeling only intensifies. Once again you are forced to complete the same general areas which offer nothing new – not in terms of cooperation which boils down to “have three people pull three levers” and not in terms of using unique abilities to solve puzzles. The platforming, with which the game is abounded, is stiff and rather annoying, not surprising given Gilbert's detest of it. You begin to long for a normal inventory instead of going to-and-fro carrying items one at a time. The character-specific areas feel wonderful and refreshing but once again the crew’s struggles feel futile in the wake of the ending. Even the addition of a “good” ending that can be achieved is meaningless, as it feels tacked on and irritatingly un-final.\n\nWhen you look back on The Cave you see an unpolished gem that, with a bit more work and thought put into it, might be seen as an example of proper gameplay-driven narrative dealing with common, but not trivial, themes. It is a journey that does as much well as it does bad leaving the player with a thirst for more. As for my dilemma – unfortunately it is neither the past nor the future but the present, in all it’s wobbly, uncertain and disappointing glory.\n\nhttp://www.gatheryourparty.com/articles/2013/03/29/the-cave-review/\n\n(Do not buy this at full price.)","November 28, 2013","false","7.3"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","2"

Yes, the game supports couch multiplayer, but actually it does not work well. It is part of the puzzles to do something with one character while you leave the others do something else. This means characters can, and often do get off-screen. The result is that your buddy is just watching you as you walk, and walk, and walk, and walk... My daughter was totally bored and quickly abandoned me.\n\nAll together this is not a bad game but not a good one, either. I, at least, had no joy when the characters reached to bottom of the Cave and had no inspiration to try a different set of characters which would present me some different parts of the Cave.","December 16, 2014","false","5.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

You can take control of a group of three quite unique and well desighned characters from a pool of seven as you lead them to face their dark secrets and gain the one thing they truely desire.\n\nThe problem with this game come in three factors. One, while the characters look interesting at first glance. you quickly realize that the only view into what make them up is literaly a seven page comic that you find pieces of alonge the way. None of them will say anything about the things and events around them which is a heavy staple in any adventure game. Having differnt people observe the same places that you have to go through every playthough in seperat ways would drastically cut down on the monotonus parts of this game which leads to...\n\nFactor number two which is that several of the puzzles while clever are hanpered by long hallway and slow ladders seperating each puzzle piece. This is also compounded by the fact that each member of your group can only carry one item at a time neccesitating constant back and forth even well you do find out what to do. One play through was hard enough which leads to.....\n\nFactor number three which is that if you want to get all of the ending comic panels you HAVE to play the game from start to end SIX TIMES. you have seven people to play as each with a good and bad ending which is decided by one final choice and a hidden one at that. Also you would think that playing as new people would change the game drastically but eachs person's dark deed moment is sectioned off into a different stage. I could see which ones I was missing as I passed the themed enterance down the cave.\n\nIt pains me to pick this game to pieces because I really wanted this to be good. It had a good consept from under used genre. I was even reminded of a lighthearted silent hill as wierd as that sounds because both are about people with dark pasts venturing into a location that changes itself to force that dark secret into the person's face, But it's held back by bad use of the three person mechanic, shallow characters, and tedious puzzles.","January 28, 2014","false","3.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

For one or two playthroughs.\n\nUnfortunately, if you're like me, and you want to finish a game in it's entirety, you're probably gonna have a bad time. This game demands to be replayed. Not because of any merit as a "good game" deserving of replaying, the replayability is forced on you.\n\nNow this might not seem like a big deal. But it really is, you start to notice how ridiculously slow this game is as soon as you jump into your second playthrough (you'll probably notice it in your first playthrough, but it's not quite as annoying then). It takes ages to do even the simplest of tasks, like climbing a rope, or ladder.\n\nOn top of being slow, this game is repetitive and boring. Sure, the different characters have their own personal level, but that's as much variation as you're gonna find. Between each character level, you have "interlude" levels, which are also always the same, no matter what characters you choose.\n\nAnd finally, the story, if you can even call it that. The writing is just stupid. The Cave itself is a character, who narrates the game, with bad jokes and cheap foreshadowing. Apparently, The Cave is trying to teach you, and the characters, some kind of deep, moral lesson, but everything about this "lesson" is rather ambiguous. The playable characters themselves have absolutely zero depth to them, they just aren't interesting. The only story you get for them are some drawings and a handful of captions to go with them.\n\nSo, if you don't really care about getting the most of your game, and you enjoy platformers, you might like this game. And even then, don't pick it up at full price, wait for it it hit a steep discount, or end up in a bundle.\n\nOtherwise?

The game has a handful or fairly interesting stories to tell, but the gameplay itself is just a mess. This is a platformer game that wants you to control three characters at a time to move through various puzzles and situations - and each character has their own unique power that helps them with puzzles. While that sounds fun, the problem is that each of the character's abilities are more or less irrelevant.\n\nThe game is broken up into areas where you have all three of your characters at your disposal - where non of your abilities matter and you're really just playing as one character and annoyingly dragging the other two along for the ride - or you're playing sections meant specifically for one of your individual characters that is suited to their unique power. These sections really don't make up for the others in creativity or enjoyment - they're fairly dull gameplay wise through and through. This game is really about the story, which I generally don't mind at all - but with games like that, the gameplay really has to either supplement the story or get out of the way. The problem with The Cave is that the gameplay isn't just in the way, but it is really just a chore to slog through for anyone with basic platforming skills. Your final product is a game with a few good stories with a lot of not fun stuff in the way of them. This game sounds fun on paper, but I wouldn't let that fool you - The Cave never meets its potential and will likely leave you sometimes bored, sometimes frustrated, and mostly underwhelmed.","January 8, 2015","false","9.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has some nice puzzles, good voice acting (mostly narrative), and some dark humor. The game centers around 7 different characters, from who you can take 3 with you per playthrough. There are ca. 7 puzzle sets per playthrough, that means 4 common ones which are identical in every playhtrough, and 3 which are character specific. And there lies the big problem of the game... you need at least 3 playthroughs to see most of the game (although in the 3rd playthrough, only 1 of the 7 puzzlesets is still new and unique!) an there is a lot of backtracking. You even need 5 complete playthroughs to get all achievements/see the whole story, although only 1% is still novel, and that is quite boring. It was already a chore for me to do 3 playthroughs, thats all I will do.","December 30, 2015","true","13.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The dialog and art style are the two good qualities this game offers.  The frequent backtracking regarding puzzles, need to repeat the game multiple times for completion, and obtuseness of some puzzles (or ease for some) are only some of the negatives.\n\nThe worst part of my experience (having played this one and one half years after release) was the game-breaking bug of one of my characters falling into nothingness and being deleted from my three available slots.  This left me unable to continue in the game.  The only thing left for me to do is to restart from the beginning which I will not be doing any time soon as replaying these puzzles is tedious at best.\n\nAs an aside, while the game allows for multiplayer, this may as well be reduced to pass and play with a controller.

The puzzles seem to be all over the board with not a lot of hints on what you should be doing, tho overall its a find key open door concept for most things.\n\nThe game has different areas, some seem based on the characters and others are inaccessible, perhaps trying to promote replayability by picking the other available heroes a second time. No real tool tips on why you should pick certain characters to start off.\n\nThe game overall has a nice design and I will probably finish it eventually, but at times it seems forced to be multiple games in one, too all over the board, hard to get imersed in to the world or the game play with 3 characters if you compare it to something like Trine.\n\nEdit:Just got the the end, and there is no ending, you are basically encouraged to start over with other characters, which in turn will make you replay about half of the same game play to once again, get to no ending.

After my first playthrough I got to admit it was pretty fun, but the next two runs got boring and repetitive since your force to play through the same puzzle areas just to get the new part of the cave thats base on a different character you choose. The worse part in playing this is on the 3rd run you not only force to do the same puzzle areas but the same two character special areas with nothing new to challange you whatsoever just to get to the last area you have not explore.  Each characters in the game have a special trait in which to solve different puzzles. unfortunately they can only use them productively in their own special world thus making them unreliable when it comes to the  regular repetitive puzzle areas we all love so much. honestly the creaters could have made a better game if they allow us  to choose any of the seven characters on the fly and explore the whole cave in one run with added puzzles that requires more than one of their special abilities. I did enjoy the visuals, story, and voice acting since it reminds me of nightmare before christmas, Overall I say it's better to pass since it's a reptitive grind just to experiance the whole game. It would have been fine if they made it a one time playthrough with extra levels that extands the use of their abilities.

While co-operative gameplay may be different, playing alone will require you to make the same journey to the next puzzle for each of the three characters you control, meaning a minimum of 3-times for one-way, 6-times if you need to double-back (and you likely will), and any number more if you get stuck. This game offers little more than repetition and traversing the more-or-less linier path, which is rendered a chore by the clunky and innacurate controls. If you're looking for a fun, beautiful, side-scrolling action-puzzler, you're far better off with Trine (which also offers 3-player co-op).\n\nIf you're a die-hard fan of Double-Fine, as I am, give it a go. There are nods to your favourite games and glimmers of that humor we all love (not to mention the beautiful drawn-art and character design), yet within an hour I was bored and frustrated, and by two I'm writing this, not expecting the experiance to improve. Do yourself a favour and get a copy of Brutal Legend: a visually stunning and rich world full of action, humor and emotion that this game seems devoid of.","December 26, 2013","false","8.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

To describe it in one sentence would be "One big glorious shared masturbation between Tim Schafer and the other Double Fine guys and every single one of their fans".\n\nThe way I see it, this is like Psychonauts but with the focus entirely on dialog and character development. It's also what Psychonauts would have been like if it were not for EA and LucasArts being moral watchdog pieces of ♥♥♥♥. It explores pretty dark motivations and is not afraid of showing fairly brutal murder that the cartoony aesthetic makes more grim for some reason. Especially because of how The Cave reacts to it so non-chalantly. He's seen this cycle repeat for thousands of years.\n\nThis is where the spoilers start. From what I can tell The Cave is a purgatory of sorts. Characters are stuck in a loop of reincarnation and retreading their paths until they can not be total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and be redeemed. It really makes the playthroughs seamless from both a story and technical standpoint.\n\nSpeaking of technical standpoint, from the perspective of a programmer I am absolutely in love with this game for a few reasons. Firstly, it uses Buddha (appropriate name hm?) which as far as I can tell is an engine that Double Fine wrote for their stuff in house and uses Lua as an extension language. They used it for Costume Quest and probably Stacking and others. I deeply admire and respect when people write engines that are reusable and aren't just marketing throw-aways. Damn shame that Double Fine is keeping it proprietary though.\n\nBesides that, the story justifies the reuse of game assets marvelously. It uses mostly the same map but with minor changes for each character that opens pathways and other branches. It gets a little bit repetitive when you're doing the generic transition levels but still. I rarely see such a robust way of extending a game in a non-intrusive manner.","November 29, 2014","true","14.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Even if you don't care about achievements, you'd have to play three separate times just to see every playable character. I love double fine, but man does this game stink.

I doubt that you'd be surprised to hear that this game was developed by Double Fine, as the Psychonauts-esque zaniness and humour remains present in this title.\n\nThe game is not without its peeves though. Take for example the fact that there are 7 characters with unique stories, yet you cannot adventure with more than 3 of them at the same time. This means playing through the game 3 times, once with 2 characters you've already played with, left as irritating third wheels. What's more, each character has a good ending and a bad ending, which means playing through the game more than once with each character anyway in order to obtain all the endings (Which I wouldn't personally recommend doing, seeing as the endings change very little) There are even several default levels in-between the character driven story levels, which you have to play every time, and playing through these levels becomes tedious very quickly, as you are often forced to backtrack in these stages.\n\nDespite all this, I'd recommend this title.

I loved Psychonauts, and I was hoping for the clever humor that was present in that game to be in this one. In aspects, the game is pretty funny. It was interesting enough to get me to continue playing.\n\nBut the gameplay. I found myself exceedingly frustrated during the gameplay. I like games where I can dive in, where I don't have to read the instructions and learn a whole new complex system. I found myself stuck about an hour into the game. Each of the seven characters have their own individual power, and it was at this point in the game I would have to use that. Except I didn't know that. It was a very frustrating ten minutes until I started looking through the menu for something like hints or tips or something, and then I saw that each character had a power. "Okay, that makes sense. Let's keep playing," I thought to myself.\n\nAfter completing the first character story area, I found myself a bit stuck again. I knew what I needed, but I didn't know how to get it. Luckily, I figured that out fairly quickly. I performed 2/3 of the tasks for the miner, and I found myself stuck on the third. I figured that to solve it, I had to use an object that I had earlier. I didn't know why, I just thought, "Why else would they give me this thing if I'm not going to use it?" And so I tried it. It didn't work. It was at that time that I gave up and looked at a guide. I figured out that my set up was right, I was taking the right path but there was one little thing that I had to do that I didn't do. How I would have been able to figure it out on my own, I have no idea.\n\nAnd that's what I think the problem is with this game. At times, it's pretty obvious what you're supposed to do. But the approach is so particular. You can spend five to ten to fifteen minutes attempting the same action--near the actual solution--but not continue the story because there is some subtle (or maybe completely absent) detail that tells you how to solve a puzzle. The movement in this game is really wonky too. I find myself running into spikes all of the time. Having to control three characters--make them all climb the same rope, ever so slowly, is tedious work as well.\n\nI'm glad that I purchased this game on sale, but I'm sad that I paid money at all.","September 16, 2014","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its meets many of those expectations without any doubts. Wonderful visuals without having to drift backwards in graphics quality.  Seems many old school adventure game developers feel that in order to get that old school feel the graphics need to suffer. In this case it proves you can have both classic gaming wrapped in charming graphics.  Very interesting twist having 7 characters to choose from, each with their own unique skills or special abilities.\n\nThis goes along with a lot of the more recent adventure style games requiring multiple characters. One needs to be sent to hold a certain lever, another to pull on something else while the 3rd is there to accomplish the task. Each of 7 characters has a special gift or ability. The adventurer had her lasso in order to swing from over head features while the "Twins" can leave phantoms of themselves in place. Overall a great title, certainly does not disappoint. Puzzles are hard to enough to keep me interested. Very little if NO hand holding with this one. One thing the screenshots dont do justice to just how charming and nice the graphics are. Very well done title.","January 25, 2013","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","5"

You choose 3 of 7 characters to enter the cave and each character will have their own puzzle level with 3 constant puzzle levels that the player must always play through.\n\nFor the old school adventure aficionados, the Cave won't be a challenge and may not live up to the experiences of games such as Monkey Island. For the rest the Cave sits as an enjoyable puzzle game with simple control schemes and interesting puzzle levels.\n\nThere are 7 total characters each with a different special ability, the only issue I have with the abilities is that most of them are really only used in their specific levels, otherwise some of the abilities are pretty useless through out the rest of the game. There are characters that will allow you to get through certain puzzles quicker than normal but no puzzle requires a character outside of the main character for that story. Each character has their own story to tell, mostly told through their own level as well as through the storyboards that you pick up throughout the game.\n\nDue to only being able to play 3 characters at a time, multiple playthroughs of the game are needed to see everyone's ending. This only causes problems when you have to play the default puzzles that always show up in the game. It would have been better if there was say 6 default puzzles and 3 random ones would be dropped in everytime you played to keep the player guessing as to which puzzle was next. I got bored of the default puzzles real quick after playthrough 5 and up.\n\nThe main dialogue in the game comes from the Cave itself and is really well written. Sure you'll get bored of it after playing through the game several times but on first play through it's enjoyable to listen to.\n\nThe Cave is an adventure game worth playing but don't come in expecting it to replicate the old school adventure games.","January 1, 2015","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gilbert designed the game with more than one player in mind though, so if you have a like minded sibling or a spouse on hand, definitely let them take over once you're done with your playtrough(s) and help them get trough the game to see endings you haven't witnessed.

And look -- there is key. Oh, what should you do?". The platforming is also on the easy side and mainly a way to have something to do while ferrying said key to said door.\n\nThe environments are visually interesting. Each character has their own ability, and a unique game section, most of which have some combination of plot/backstory related to that character.  That's the highlight of the game; it is fun to see the special areas, and a few of them have genuinely interesting puzzles.\n\nExcept there is one extremely annoying aspect: You can take three characters per game. So to experience all seven stories, you will have to play the game three times -- and the common areas aren't interesting enough to make play number three be other than a drag. Oh, and if you avoid spoilers by not reading how to do the achievements until after your play-through, it is quite likely to need a fourth play-through.\n\nSo, it is a mixed bag.

Highlights I think were the twins area, the explorer area, and the tropical island.\n\nGraphics were just right for the tone of the game, and I played it to completion three times to experience all the different character areas.","December 13, 2014","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just as good as The trine games (if not better)!  Very smooth cartoon graphics, a cast of 7 diverse, playable characters.  Each character has a unique abilty as well.  My favorite aspect of the game is how each character has their own "level" can only be played when you have them in your party (only 3 in your party  per playthrough), so you can't experience the full game in one playthrough.  Now you're probably thinking "I don't want to have to play the game more than once". The beauty of this though is that it each playthrough feels different, because you're not replaying it in the same sequence and learning new things ech time you have a new character.  Another great feature is that you can only solve certain puzzles with specific characters because their abilities are rquired.  Don't worry though, you can always progress!  Anyway, my first playthrough took me about 5+ hours, and I'm currently on my second.  I hope to see some more amazing and challenging puzzlers like this in the future!\n\nP.S.  The narrator is the actual cave that you are traversing.  The story is cheesy, but also very funny at times.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/idylles/recommended/221810/","idylles","idylles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/idylles/","19 products in account","I think the most impressive feature of this game can be found in the multiple choice set up.  Choosing from seven characters you pick three and switch between their skills – e.g. teleportation, a brief moment of immortality, Telekinesis, etc. –  to travel through the cave and ultimately "survive" the game.  Characters each have their own backstory which are experienced through areas assigned to their stereotypical being.  As the adventurerer you will find yourself in a pyramid recovering a sarcophagus while, as the Monk, you search for enlightenment in a temple.\n\nAll of the above enables you to replay this game without experiencing déjà vu – which is a main reason why many of my games end up on a high shelf – so you can still experience different stories after your first time.\n\nIn terms of tone, The Cave is a dour adventure – existing through puzzles – but you can still find yourself grinning by the quirky humour of the cave and the lively gameplay.  The puzzles are never unbearable or difficult.  Given, they aren't difficult at all and constantly having to switch between characters can get weary but, eventually, the game's design and concept makes up for that.  The game will save you some time as you can't leave behind a character due to a lack of switching.  You can either go no further wihout the help of another character or if you are too far ahead they'll eventually follow you to where you are.  The variation in character skills and environments also helps.\n\nSummed up, The Cave is great if you're looking to have some casual fun.  It won't challenge your mind.  You'll find yourself in a world where everything is turned into a joke – sometimes subtle or even cruel – yet the story is well constructed and narrated.  All that through the enjoyable voice of Stephen Stanton. Because after all, you experience the stories through The – speaking – Cave, which on its own is a cheerful concept.\n\nIt's a matter of whether you can enjoy a charming, casual game.  Don't expect challenging puzzles and levels that need a large amount of time.  This game can be seen as a piece of art, something to enjoy, rather than something you have to fight through.  8/10","July 13, 2014","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game forces painfully slow backtracking as you figure out a puzzle. Funnily enough, what's worse is when you can't backtrack: Because you frequently pass points of no return accidentally and the game autosaves, you can't have fun exploring an area you've completed because you risk losing access to collectibles or missable achievements. If that is a part of gaming you enjoy, it pretty much forces you to play with a guide open to keep you from missing anything, completely devaluing the collectibles and achievements.\n\nHowever the most aggregious, avoidable design sin is tha for each playthrough you select 3 out of 7 characters (I'll say it again: Three) to take through the campaign, which changes three character specific levels to the game. Did you catch that? The selection of three out of seven? If you are going to obligate replays like this, why not have a number of playable characters that is divisible by three!? This is infuriating and since several puzzles in the cave are permenant fixtures, not character specific, this means you have to play through some puzzles 3 times, and other puzzles (for the two characters you'll play twice) 2 times. Getting all achievements demands a total of 5 playthroughs, but by then you'll have lost all interest.\n\nThere are some great indie-like titles on Steam, I encourage you to find them instead of buying this one, regardless of the price.","July 28, 2014","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story and narration is filled with dark humor which lifted my frustrations at times. The puzzles are fairly challenging without a guide, but are quite simple with a few tips and tricks.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/idylles/recommended/221810/","idylles","idylles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/idylles/","19 products in account","I think the most impressive feature of this game can be found in the multiple choice set up.  Choosing from seven characters you pick three and switch between their skills – e.g. teleportation, a brief moment of immortality, Telekinesis, etc. –  to travel through the cave and ultimately "survive" the game.  Characters each have their own backstory which are experienced through areas assigned to their stereotypical being.  As the adventurerer you will find yourself in a pyramid recovering a sarcophagus while, as the Monk, you search for enlightenment in a temple.\n\nAll of the above enables you to replay this game without experiencing déjà vu – which is a main reason why many of my games end up on a high shelf – so you can still experience different stories after your first time.\n\nIn terms of tone, The Cave is a dour adventure – existing through puzzles – but you can still find yourself grinning by the quirky humour of the cave and the lively gameplay.  The puzzles are never unbearable or difficult.  Given, they aren't difficult at all and constantly having to switch between characters can get weary but, eventually, the game's design and concept makes up for that.  The game will save you some time as you can't leave behind a character due to a lack of switching.  You can either go no further wihout the help of another character or if you are too far ahead they'll eventually follow you to where you are.  The variation in character skills and environments also helps.\n\nSummed up, The Cave is great if you're looking to have some casual fun.  It won't challenge your mind.  You'll find yourself in a world where everything is turned into a joke – sometimes subtle or even cruel – yet the story is well constructed and narrated.  All that through the enjoyable voice of Stephen Stanton. Because after all, you experience the stories through The – speaking – Cave, which on its own is a cheerful concept.\n\nIt's a matter of whether you can enjoy a charming, casual game.  Don't expect challenging puzzles and levels that need a large amount of time.  This game can be seen as a piece of art, something to enjoy, rather than something you have to fight through.  8/10","July 13, 2014","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I hate playing them. The Cave is no different.\n\nTo begin with, it's an adventure game mixed with platforming, which means that all the inevitable back-and-forth wandering you have to do is no made even more tedious by jumping puzzles. It seems an odd combination that is unlikely to attract fans of either genre. Worse, the platforming isn't particularly challenging, and the adventuring is pretty shallow. I enjoyed neither portion.\n\nAdd to this the lack of clues or direction; is that thing I am standing in front of not working because it is just background art or because I'm not carrying the right item? And if I have the right item, which of my three characters is carrying it (hint: it is always the one furthest away). These are problems adventure games encountered - and solved - two decades ago and it is irritating to see them return.\n\nWorse, the story isn't particularly engaging and - to enjoy it to its fullest - requires multiple playthroughs. I couldn't even stomach the one.\n\nMaybe one day I'll watch the game as a Lets Play, but I've no interest to actually play the game myself anytime soon.\n","June 24, 2014","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although there are times where dialogue with in-game characters can get annoying when you're running back and forth trying to figure things out.\n\nPuzzles were unique and challenging. However, the time travel level, I found, was a little far fetched so it took me a while (and some hints) to get through that one. There were some levels too, that became monotonous & time consuming due to backtracking by having not chosen the appropriate character for a particular task or just simply trying to find clues on what you needed to do.\n\nI do like the fact you had to choose the character best suited to solve a particular part of the puzzle and that you can get through the most levels with whichever 3 characters you choose. Some levels aren't available if you don't have the characters to get through them, but you can always go back and replay with new characters - which is nice.\n\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend playing.

I'm currently playing with a knight who has the power of invincibility; an adventurer who can swing a grappling hook; and twins who have the ability to duplicate themselves. When you access special areas of the cave, you uncover scenes from your characters' pasts. Also, each character has a special quest that occurs in a unique area of the cave. (The knight is tasked by a king to defeat a dragon and retrieve an amulet for his daughter.)\n\nYou switch control between the three characters as you advance through the cave. Often, teamwork is required as you must position the characters in certain areas or have them perform tasks simultaneously. There are monsters, but there is no combat. Instead, you must figure out how to get past monsters with strategy alone. For one early example, you "battle" a dragon with a hot dog and a claw like those found in an arcade game.\n\nControls are simple, consisting of moving side to side, jumping, climbing, and picking up and using various objects. Characters can only hold one object at a time, and certain objects are needed to advance through different areas of the cave. Because it's not always obvious which objects must be used, you will often find yourself doubling back to retrieve dropped objects. This is a new type of game for me, so I've found myself running around aimlessly quite a bit, experimenting with different combinations of characters and objects to try to advance.\n\nSo far, I've experienced no glitches. What I have experienced are clever puzzles, beautiful visuals, and a game that will lend itself to re-playability as I will want to try out all of the characters.","June 12, 2015","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't think that would be a problem (because I like exploring), but when you need to navigate the same series of sprawling passages over and over again to solve a puzzle -- especially when it's a trial-and-error puzzle that involves a prop you need to re-collect every time you fail -- you start to wonder what the developers were thinking. All the running around gets frustrating, which leads me to the walkthrough page faster than I'd like: if I've got to do so much ditch-digging just to try something that I don't know will work, I'd rather spoil it for myself.\n\nBut I still recommend the game if you know what you're in for.

The game play reminded me a lot of the old Vikings games, minus the perma-deaths, where you had to rely on the abilities of more than one person to get a job done.  The character levels and the “transition” levels (those stages usually between the character specific ones) were pretty fun and the puzzles, while not that hard, did give my brain a little exercise.     I won’t even bother gush over the art style or script for this game because you’d have to be made of stone not to like them.\n\nThis all being said, I did have a few problems with it.  First off, seven was not the lucky number here, it should have been nine.  The reason for this is that, by the time you get to the third round of the game, you have now exhausted playing all but a single character.  This means you have to repeat at least two people’s levels.  Knowing exactly what to do makes for a less fun experience the second or third time around.  I say “third time around” because of my second complaint.  I would have loved to see this game provide more than three “transition” stages.  Again, the ideal number would have been nine.  If the game designers had given each character their own transitional stage, then you would have never felt like you were playing the same game twice.  Tedium is the worst enemy of the “one solution only” adventure game.  If you have already solved the puzzle once, what value is there in solving it exactly the same way again?\n\nOf course, even after saying that, I would still recommend this game to anyone who wants an excuse to laugh and enjoy a few hours running around a sentient cave.  Just remember, sometimes your greatest desires can be your own worst enemy.","February 10, 2014","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Torusthebanana/recommended/221810/","Torusthebanana","Torus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Torusthebanana/","574 products in account","My experience with Double Fine's games are that they tend to be equal parts hit and miss. The hit is usually in the concepts, and the miss will be in the execution. This game's no different.\n\nThis game is basically a hybrid between a point & click adventure and a platformer, with a party of 3 characters running around at once, and many puzzles based on using 2 or 3 at the same time. Said party of 3 gets stuck in a sentient, talking Cave, which challenges them to learn a valuable life lesson. Failure implied not escaping from the Cave.\n\nThe concept is interesting, the art & music also work well. It's all remniscent of a brighter version of Tim Burton's puppet movies. It also has a dark sense of humor, and some exploration is required to get the full story on the characters you're playing with. That covers the hits.\n\nThe problems lie in the execution:\nEach character has a special ability, and a special section of the cave dedicated to them. Sadly, those sections are also the only bits where the different abilities really matter. Outside, there's a few points where you can use them, but there's always a generic solution close-by that renders the different abilities mostly obsolete.\nAs a minor gripe, the game also doesn't offer any real hints that the special abilities exist, unless you open the "How to play" option in the menu.\n\nThe controls for the platforming also feel sloppy at times, not a huge distraction as there's no real precision jumping etc. involved - the adventuring is definitely the dominant gameplay. But it can get annoying at times.\nThe most baffling design choice though, is the fact that despite death having no penalties, you can easily fall to your "death"  anyway. This really serves no point, and just results in lost time as you turn into a puff of smoke and float back to a previous checkpoint.\n\nOverall: recommended if you're a fan of point'n'click adventures and want to play one with a twist. If that's not your thing, you'll probably want to pass on this though.\n\n\n","February 3, 2014","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So this is why adventurers come to seek out its secrets in the pursuit of the objects of their desire and you being the one to guide them through their quest.\n\nYou get to pick 3 out of 7 characters, each with a unique ability and a unique set of rooms only available when this character is in your party as you try to get to the bottom of the cave and retrieve your object of desire. Puzzles do offer a variety of possible solutions depending on your party members that make a couple play through with all characters fun. Same parts though are very repetitve as they are part of any given play through.\n\nFor a budget price this little piece of a game is a gem if you like some sarcastic humour. Its not really anything that you can play on endless still after you unlocked the last achievement though.","December 29, 2013","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If one should pick a game-category for THE CAVE, surely it would be an adventure game.\nYou can pick up items use them on something or combine them to find solutions for tasks & quests throughout the game.\nOnly that every character can pick up just one item at a time.\nThis makes it really a fresh and easy puzzle game not as complicated as some classic adventures with a fast gameplay and a rewarding story.\n\nFor THE CAVE not being platform-game/jump&run, the gameplay is great. It makes a lot of fun jumping around and hanging from cliffs, climbing up ropes and ladders while finding solutions for the puzzles. I played with keyboard which works great. You could also use the mouse or both. Characters are able to walk or run and every one of them has its own special ability. This means you can jump, use things, pick items up or drop em and use your special ability. Of course your character needs a little bit of time to completly stop out of a move, but you´ll get used to it. I don´t see no bad gameplay here!\n(many reviews say this, but I really can´t verify this at all)\n\nThe graphics are really amazing on this one: Characters, items, backgrounds, sequences and effects are simply beautiful and go very well together with the comic drawings you find throughout the game, that are part of the characters story.\nAlso the sounds and the music are wonderful. A very pleasing atmospheric soundtrack suiting the situations very well.\nThe Voice of the Actors truely are fantastic and make you laugh out loud. It´s actually great that the characters don´t talk, as THE CAVE does the talking as an all knowing epic narrator. Literally EPIC!\n\nThe puzzles are fair and not to hard, sometimes you are stuck, but mostly because of missing a path or trying to solve puzzles all alone instead of using "a little help from your friends" like the beatles told you already.\nTeamwork is really important in this game, so if you stuck try changing more often between your teammates.\nSometimes pulling is better than pushing in some occasions but you should be able to solve any puzzle without further help, of course there is the internet, what even the programmers tell you at one point in the game. But you really won´t need it, use your brains and be proud of your cleverness!\n\nI think the story is really nice and well told. It is separeted between the characters, like THE CAVE says "It´s about them".\nBut it's also about THE CAVE itself, what it is and does with people, that enter it.\nBut, see for yourself... (MUUUAHHHA HA  HAAA HAAARGH).\n\nOverall: A great adventure game with good puzzles and a lot of dark humor, a nice story with interesting characters about virtues & vices, inside a beautiful programmed and animated talking/narrating CAVE. Even if you know some puzzles already, it makes a lot of fun to play them again, being faster and more familiar with the puzzles and the gameplay. This is really a game you will have fun for a longer time than playing it through once. (Even after knowing almost all stories, I will try to unlock all the achievements, as I´m really somehow stuck IN THE CAVE. I just like it down there!)\nSo in my opinion the metascore is really not representative, but every good gamer knows what he´s looking for best for himself, anyways. So if you like good puzzles while running, swimming and climbing through a mysterious world full of neat creatures and various rooms of action, in one game that you can play through in an evening or two.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Torusthebanana/recommended/221810/","Torusthebanana","Torus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Torusthebanana/","574 products in account","My experience with Double Fine's games are that they tend to be equal parts hit and miss. The hit is usually in the concepts, and the miss will be in the execution. This game's no different.\n\nThis game is basically a hybrid between a point & click adventure and a platformer, with a party of 3 characters running around at once, and many puzzles based on using 2 or 3 at the same time. Said party of 3 gets stuck in a sentient, talking Cave, which challenges them to learn a valuable life lesson. Failure implied not escaping from the Cave.\n\nThe concept is interesting, the art & music also work well. It's all remniscent of a brighter version of Tim Burton's puppet movies. It also has a dark sense of humor, and some exploration is required to get the full story on the characters you're playing with. That covers the hits.\n\nThe problems lie in the execution:\nEach character has a special ability, and a special section of the cave dedicated to them. Sadly, those sections are also the only bits where the different abilities really matter. Outside, there's a few points where you can use them, but there's always a generic solution close-by that renders the different abilities mostly obsolete.\nAs a minor gripe, the game also doesn't offer any real hints that the special abilities exist, unless you open the "How to play" option in the menu.\n\nThe controls for the platforming also feel sloppy at times, not a huge distraction as there's no real precision jumping etc. involved - the adventuring is definitely the dominant gameplay. But it can get annoying at times.\nThe most baffling design choice though, is the fact that despite death having no penalties, you can easily fall to your "death"  anyway. This really serves no point, and just results in lost time as you turn into a puff of smoke and float back to a previous checkpoint.\n\nOverall: recommended if you're a fan of point'n'click adventures and want to play one with a twist. If that's not your thing, you'll probably want to pass on this though.\n\n\n","February 3, 2014","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stroper/recommended/221810/","stroper","English Muffin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stroper/","522 products in account","Before I get into my complaints about this game, I just want to make it clear that I did, overall, really enjoy playing this game and would happily buy the sequel if they ever get around to making one.  The game play reminded me a lot of the old Vikings games, minus the perma-deaths, where you had to rely on the abilities of more than one person to get a job done.  The character levels and the “transition” levels (those stages usually between the character specific ones) were pretty fun and the puzzles, while not that hard, did give my brain a little exercise.     I won’t even bother gush over the art style or script for this game because you’d have to be made of stone not to like them.\n\nThis all being said, I did have a few problems with it.  First off, seven was not the lucky number here, it should have been nine.  The reason for this is that, by the time you get to the third round of the game, you have now exhausted playing all but a single character.  This means you have to repeat at least two people’s levels.  Knowing exactly what to do makes for a less fun experience the second or third time around.  I say “third time around” because of my second complaint.  I would have loved to see this game provide more than three “transition” stages.  Again, the ideal number would have been nine.  If the game designers had given each character their own transitional stage, then you would have never felt like you were playing the same game twice.  Tedium is the worst enemy of the “one solution only” adventure game.  If you have already solved the puzzle once, what value is there in solving it exactly the same way again?\n\nOf course, even after saying that, I would still recommend this game to anyone who wants an excuse to laugh and enjoy a few hours running around a sentient cave.  Just remember, sometimes your greatest desires can be your own worst enemy.","February 10, 2014","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gilbert designed the game with more than one player in mind though, so if you have a like minded sibling or a spouse on hand, definitely let them take over once you're done with your playtrough(s) and help them get trough the game to see endings you haven't witnessed. As for the rest of us who don’t, finishing it is a repetitive chore, albeit not a totally unpleasant one.\nRecommended, though to physics puzzle platformer/Gilbert fans only.","December 27, 2014","true","16.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You choose 3 of 7 characters to enter the cave and each character will have their own puzzle level with 3 constant puzzle levels that the player must always play through.\n\nFor the old school adventure aficionados, the Cave won't be a challenge and may not live up to the experiences of games such as Monkey Island. For the rest the Cave sits as an enjoyable puzzle game with simple control schemes and interesting puzzle levels.\n\nThere are 7 total characters each with a different special ability, the only issue I have with the abilities is that most of them are really only used in their specific levels, otherwise some of the abilities are pretty useless through out the rest of the game. There are characters that will allow you to get through certain puzzles quicker than normal but no puzzle requires a character outside of the main character for that story. Each character has their own story to tell, mostly told through their own level as well as through the storyboards that you pick up throughout the game.\n\nDue to only being able to play 3 characters at a time, multiple playthroughs of the game are needed to see everyone's ending. This only causes problems when you have to play the default puzzles that always show up in the game. It would have been better if there was say 6 default puzzles and 3 random ones would be dropped in everytime you played to keep the player guessing as to which puzzle was next. I got bored of the default puzzles real quick after playthrough 5 and up.\n\nThe main dialogue in the game comes from the Cave itself and is really well written. Sure you'll get bored of it after playing through the game several times but on first play through it's enjoyable to listen to.\n\nThe Cave is an adventure game worth playing but don't come in expecting it to replicate the old school adventure games.","January 1, 2015","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music and controls are okay. But the main thing are the stories of the set of characters three of which you choose for an adventure in and narrated by The Cave.\n\n+ Interesting stories and good narration\n+ Nice elevator-music-like background music\n+ Multiple adventures through The Cave with almost no feeling of repetition\n+ Mostly good controls, controller recommended\n-- Missing button to start a new game when in a game\n- Mostly unskippable cut-scenes and no fast-forwarding for text\n- Walking doesn't save you from walking over edges\n- Inconsistent Time Traveller controls\n- Dropping stuff when quitting Cave Paintings\n- Some glitches\n\nAt the start of the game you basically choose your adventure by selecting three out of seven characters. Each of the seven characters has their own 1 (and a bit) story which, connected by some sort of communal stories, is narrated by The Cave and supported by Cave Paintings.\nDuring those stories you travel through The Cave and have to solve basically self-contained puzzles in a point-and-click fashion, although this works well with a controller, where each character can carry at most one item. The music is not to memorable but is in no way off-putting.\nAlthough the game encourages multiple play-throughs you can avoid the feeling of repetition by coming up with a number of different approaches after the first encounter, some of them seriously reducing the time for specific parts.\n\nIn the context of achievements I found the controls somewhat lacking. Their is a do-not-die achievement that would seriously benefit if the walking mechanic also prevented chars from walking over edges. Instead characters have sort of roll-out phase which may well let you walk into the next pit and death. This nuisance was aggravated by the facts that 1. there is now way to start a new game without first quitting the game altogether, restarting it from steam, then choose and confirm you want to start a new game; and 2. cut-scenes are mostly unskippable. That's a strange thing games sometimes do. If a player has seen that cut-scene five times in the last hour they may actually know it well enough. Anyway the player should simply be able to decide whether to skip or not.\n\nSome minor gripes:\n* When leaving Cave Paintings the character sometimes drops the item they are holding.\n* The Time Traveller can basically travel over, not stand on, water, except sometimes that doesn't work.\n* The Adventurer can swing through the first lever gate when it's half open.\n* On top of the Island the Cave Painting sometimes doesn't show.\n\nOverall, what sells The Cave are the stories and the way they are narrated. Additionally it's interesting to come up with short-cuts through the game. Apart from the missing restart mechanic and mandatory cut-scenes I seriously enjoyed The Cave and thus recommend it,","April 13, 2015","true","39.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/audeez/recommended/221810/","audeez","Audeez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/audeez/","297 products in account","I didn't buy The Cave immediately when it was originally released and this is mainly because I'm not a Ron Gilbert, Tim Schafer, or Double Fine fanboy. I like all of those things, but the only Ron Gilbert game I ever played was Maniac Mansion (which was great, but I was like 8 years old), and both Tim Schafer and Double Fine have shown me that they can do as much bad as good sometimes (cough ... Brutal Legend .. cough). I did eventually acquire The Cave though and having finally played it, found I enjoyed it.\n\nRight up front, the presentation of this game is top notch. The art, controls (I used an Xbox controller), and sound were excellent. The core conceit of the game design (choosing 3 out of 7 characters to go through the cave) I felt was a bit lacking though. The game makes concessions for your not having certain characters (and their abilities) with you and with the exception of completely optional cave painting unlocks and very minor shortcuts, your choice of characters is purely narrative. This isn't horrible, but it means you'll have to play through the game 3 times to get all the character stories and content, repeating the non-character specific areas of the game each time.\n\nThe actual control of the multiple characters works rather well and for the most part the puzzles designed to rely on them are interesting as opposed to frustrating. My one gripe with the controlling multiple characters is the backtracking that takes place for each one in many instances. While there are checkpoint-like locations where the two other characters will instantly appear at the side of your controlled character in order to alleviate the tedium of treading the same ground again, some puzzles still require going back and forth through the same area with two or more characters in order to solve a puzzle.\n\nIn the end, The Cave is a pleasant blend of adventure and puzzle genres with what I would consider to be an entry-level to intermediate difficulty. What it may lack in complexity it makes up for in charm and I'd recommend it if you're looking for a mild puzzler with good personality.","December 30, 2014","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are no loading screens.  It features a tutorial that teaches you how to play while allowing you to progress.\n\nUnfortunately, this game has very little replay value.  Each character gets their own unique level, however all of the transitions are identical to one another.  After your first play through, the mandatory tutorial becomes tedious.  Until you reach a new character's dedicated level, the transitions become a grind.\n\nI very much hoped for a Spelunky-like procedural level generation at least in the transitions between each character's static rooms, but I was let down.  Much of this game is static and repetitive, though it is certainly very good looking.  I wish the developers would have put more resources into making the game playable more than once rather than making it shiny.\n\nWait for a sale, I wouldn't recommend paying more than $5 for this game.","December 10, 2015","false","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't think that would be a problem (because I like exploring), but when you need to navigate the same series of sprawling passages over and over again to solve a puzzle -- especially when it's a trial-and-error puzzle that involves a prop you need to re-collect every time you fail -- you start to wonder what the developers were thinking. All the running around gets frustrating, which leads me to the walkthrough page faster than I'd like: if I've got to do so much ditch-digging just to try something that I don't know will work, I'd rather spoil it for myself.\n\nBut I still recommend the game if you know what you're in for.

Some are very important choices. Some are not. Many of our choices are between good and evil. The choices we make, however, determine to a large extent our happiness or our unhappiness, because we have to live with the consequences of our choices." -James E. Faust\n\nOkay, besides from quotes from BrainyQuote, you probably clicked on this review to see if "The Cave" is any good. Well...it can be argued. The Cave is a puzzle solver follwoing 7 adventurers and there quest in The Cave. You'll pick 3 out of the 7 at the start, and play the whole thing with those 3. That's my first gripe with The Cave, it essentially makes you play it 3 times if you want to know all the storys. Yes, there's change in each story, but it is not worth playing 3 times. And, if you passed basic math, you'll notice that 7 isn't divisible by 3, so one character you'll have to play again. I think The Cave should of just given you all 7 to play as, and maybe only take 3 into an area.\n\nMy first, and most likely only, playthrough I took the Twins, the Hilbilly, and the Time Traveler and still thought that I got what I paid for. Story telling is what The Cave excels at, giving you snipits of a characters backstory at a time. It's intresting to see how screwed up everyone is, and makes you want to find out more.\n\nThen there's gameplay, and it's a typical puzzle game. Click this, click that, maybe click that. If you're lost, you play the "Does this go with this, this, or this" game, seeing as there isnt a hint system. The only thing negative I can say is that jumping is a little wonky. You'll want to jump to a ledge and accidentally fall to your death. Oh, you die from tall falls, so watch out.\n\nOverall, The Cave is just...alright. Is it $15 alright? Ehhhh....do your research. Look into gameplay of it, maybe watch a walkthrough of one person's story. Though, if you love puzzle solvers, buy this.","June 23, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/km_logic/recommended/221810/","km_logic","KM_Logic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/km_logic/","3 products in account","Players choose three of the seven available characters, each with unique talents. I'm currently playing with a knight who has the power of invincibility; an adventurer who can swing a grappling hook; and twins who have the ability to duplicate themselves. When you access special areas of the cave, you uncover scenes from your characters' pasts. Also, each character has a special quest that occurs in a unique area of the cave. (The knight is tasked by a king to defeat a dragon and retrieve an amulet for his daughter.)\n\nYou switch control between the three characters as you advance through the cave. Often, teamwork is required as you must position the characters in certain areas or have them perform tasks simultaneously. There are monsters, but there is no combat. Instead, you must figure out how to get past monsters with strategy alone. For one early example, you "battle" a dragon with a hot dog and a claw like those found in an arcade game.\n\nControls are simple, consisting of moving side to side, jumping, climbing, and picking up and using various objects. Characters can only hold one object at a time, and certain objects are needed to advance through different areas of the cave. Because it's not always obvious which objects must be used, you will often find yourself doubling back to retrieve dropped objects. This is a new type of game for me, so I've found myself running around aimlessly quite a bit, experimenting with different combinations of characters and objects to try to advance.\n\nSo far, I've experienced no glitches. What I have experienced are clever puzzles, beautiful visuals, and a game that will lend itself to re-playability as I will want to try out all of the characters.","June 12, 2015","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are 7 different characters to play with, each with his/her own abilities and backgrounds. You must choose 3 of them and enter the cave to discover their true nature, and help them cooperate to survive.\n\nThe game is handled with a very good, and dark, sense of humor, and alternative paths depend on what characters you pick, adding replayability.\n\nThe game is very well done, and there are very clever puzzles in it. Well, we should not expect less from Ron Gilbert. The drawings are amazing, and the designers paid great attention to details. The music and sounds are simple but add a lot to the experience, and the voice acting is top notch.\n\nI did not give 5 stars because the game itself is very short. Moreover, even when playing with a new set of characters, there are parts of the cave that are repetitive. Maybe if they had done more sections that could be played by all characters and made them appear randomly, it would have added a lot of replay value, and would have made it more fun to try to get everyone through.\n\nTarget audience: Casual players. It is too easy for hardcore gamers, though it can be enjoyed by anyone.","May 9, 2014","true","31.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When not on sale it's also worth the money. It's a nice simple platformer puzzle game with a wacky cast and a talking cave and alternate endings. So its worth the price. It's a nice enjoyable ride narrated by a talking cave. Each play through takes a few hours depending on how well you know each story you are playing through. Go ahead and give it a shot.","June 29, 2015","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/marcelcasella/recommended/221810/","marcelcasella","Mars Attack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/marcelcasella/","87 products in account","It is a puzzle solving game that reminds of the old Monkey Island days.\n\nThe Cave, which is the main character, serves as a guide as you explore its depths. There are 7 different characters to play with, each with his/her own abilities and backgrounds. You must choose 3 of them and enter the cave to discover their true nature, and help them cooperate to survive.\n\nThe game is handled with a very good, and dark, sense of humor, and alternative paths depend on what characters you pick, adding replayability.\n\nThe game is very well done, and there are very clever puzzles in it. Well, we should not expect less from Ron Gilbert. The drawings are amazing, and the designers paid great attention to details. The music and sounds are simple but add a lot to the experience, and the voice acting is top notch.\n\nI did not give 5 stars because the game itself is very short. Moreover, even when playing with a new set of characters, there are parts of the cave that are repetitive. Maybe if they had done more sections that could be played by all characters and made them appear randomly, it would have added a lot of replay value, and would have made it more fun to try to get everyone through.\n\nTarget audience: Casual players. It is too easy for hardcore gamers, though it can be enjoyed by anyone.","May 9, 2014","true","31.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although there are times where dialogue with in-game characters can get annoying when you're running back and forth trying to figure things out.\n\nPuzzles were unique and challenging. However, the time travel level, I found, was a little far fetched so it took me a while (and some hints) to get through that one. There were some levels too, that became monotonous & time consuming due to backtracking by having not chosen the appropriate character for a particular task or just simply trying to find clues on what you needed to do.\n\nI do like the fact you had to choose the character best suited to solve a particular part of the puzzle and that you can get through the most levels with whichever 3 characters you choose. Some levels aren't available if you don't have the characters to get through them, but you can always go back and replay with new characters - which is nice.\n\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend playing. It was fun!","July 11, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Beautiful platformer with some great puzzle action. Requires the skills of all three of your characters to clear the levels so you better get to understand what they can do that is special. I love the pseudo 3D scrolling environment and the commentator is a great touch. Hours of great game play to be had. Once you're done, turn around and play it again with three different characters to have a totally new experience.
