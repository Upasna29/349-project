Why is that, you ask? Because the match-making system pairs newcomers (with only their starter decks) against these sharkers. If you think it's "fun" or "challenging" to play against someone who has 40+ arsenal of devastating cards while you've only got a starter deck, then by all means play the game and enjoy in this sadomasochistic merry-go-round. The game has potential, so it's kinda sad to see that pay-2-win and an unfair matchmaking system (there are almost always around ~200 players online, so I don't see why shouldn't a newbie be matched with a newbie) makes it a title to stay clear of... at least until (and if) these issues are adressed properly (alongside the ridiculous paywall for the new heroes.)","April 27, 2014","false","10.6"," 148 of 203 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","148","203","3","22"

It's taking very long in early access, and I would not invest in it unless you're OK with an indefinite release date. there aren't really enough players in game atm to keep a steady flow of live games, and I dont enjoy asynchronous mode with this game.\n\nIt's currently in early access as I write this review, so there is somewhat of a low population. Worsened by the fact that this is a tactical ccg genre, it is already a smaller niche audience. The matches take very long (20-40 minutes on average). The grind is pretty slow. It is not very pay-2-win, but it is pay to skip or pay to accelerate. You don't have to grind for 3000 gold for a new deck, when you can plop down $5 for that deck. They are intending to give all 3 starter decks for free (which is what they announced for future plans). Buying more cards/decks doesn't necessarily give you an assured win, but it helps to optimize your deck's strategy (boom, rush, turtle, etc). Everything you can buy with real money, you can buy with in-game currency. The deck you will have in a 1-2 month's time, you can get right away by purchasing with real money. But then after 1-2 months of playing, you'll be re-earning tons of cards you've actually bought with card packs.\n\nOverall, I am a hardcore fan of the tactics genre, so I will recommend this to other hardcore fans. But I hope they make their game more accessible to the general audience. Games are very long, it is hard to find other new players or AI to practice against, and it will take a few weeks of grinding before you get a really competitive deck.\n\nNewbies in particular will have a hard time, since its low population, you will get matched with more experienced players very often. While this may seem very unfair at the start, you will gain a more competitive deck over time and understand the game better by playing better players. I reached top 20 rankings after two weeks of playing, but only after matching top 10 players consistently. It is a shark tank for newbies at the moment, and many do not survive :-) If you don't have the patience or dedication to get through the initial hump, this game probably isn't for you.\n\nI was deciding between Conquest, Scrolls and Faeria for a tactical CCG. But Faeria will be in closed beta until end of 2014 and Scrolls is dead, so you might as well try Conquest out anyway, because 1) what's the harm in trying, 2) it's free to try out.  gl hf.","July 19, 2014","true","221.1"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","2"

It just makes you go through a lot of hassle to get something you want. That, or you just do it the dirty way by forking over money and gambling for digital cards. And it's for that reason I have a bit of trouble recommending this to people.\n\nIf you guys want to see the basic gist of the game, here's a quick look video showing off its gameplay and most of its good side. It's long for a quick look, but strategy games always never go quick. And for those of you who like to keep things brief, I'll leave the summary below.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/VzypW8CM2-0\n\nI'll start by saying the gameplay is solid. The way to win the game is simple, just kill the enemy hero and the towers on their side, but what makes it fun is the mechanics behind it. There's tons of interesting units and spells that do a variety of things, and the units themselves all have specific abilities on top of filling the board. The heroes you control have powerful special abilities and can transform into even bigger monsters that dominate your foes. The resource mechanic of gems, action points, and cards flow well together. Are you out of actions? Then use gems to squeeze 3 more beatings out on your opponent. Running out of cards? Sacrifice one gem to luckily draw the spell you need to finish off a unit. And if you're short on gems, there are plenty of cards that give you more, and units can easily build mines to increase the flow once again. Combine it all together and you got yourself a mashup of meat and magic pounding against each other in the center of the battlefield. And the one named the victor is usually the one with the best chemistry and tactics.\n\nBut now that I got the reason you should play this game out of the way, I have to tell you about the stuff dragging the game through the dirt.\n\nYou start the game by selecting a hero out of 3 separate factions (basically the typical fantasy dwarfs, elves, and undead. Nothing new or unique). What you really don't know is that you're choosing the ONLY hero you can play without forking over money or gold. That's right, you pretty much go on a blind date that ends up as a shotgun wedding, so I hope you're happy with what you pick. Sure you can start a new account for free, but why should you have to go through the hassle just to try out another playstyle? And if you do, you won't be able to pool all your cards together from your other accounts, so it highly discourages you from changing right off the bat.\n\nAnother peeve of mine is most of the cards you get as rewards you can't even use. Imagine how I felt after I played multiple 30 minute matches, opened up a deck with the gold I acquired, and I could only use a SINGLE card out of the 5 given to me. One of the cards was even a component you can only make use of by combining 3 other ones to MAYBE craft a card you need. And even then, you need to level up your hero/faction in order to even craft the bloody thing in the first place.\n\nAnd speaking of crafting, let me tell you a little more on how bad it is. Plain and simple, you cannot craft the all the cards you really want and make the deck that suits your playstyle. Instead, you can only make 4 for the faction you have. And even then they smear dirt in your face because you have to get lucky with crafting drops in order to do it. It's just a sad, sad joke.\n\nNow don't get me wrong. I get the reason they do this. It's a FTP game, and they want to make money by charging you for more cards. That's perfectly fine and acceptable. But why should they limit you so greatly to just playing a single hero? Sure I may like him, but I want to see/test if I'd like another one better. I want diversity! What they should be charging for is just cards that tweak each faction, or at least grant us one of each of the factions' heroes so we at least can grasp the basic mechanics behind each one. That way when I get a card for a certain faction, I can actually use the damn thing without it being completely useless to me. I'm even able to overlook the garbage cards you can't use in anything besides crafting if they at least grant you access to other heroes from the very start.\n\nAnd since we're still on the topic of their business model, nothing pisses me off more than a token system that almost NEVER comes out even. This isn't Chuck E. Cheese. There should be straight cash bundles for everything I want. Most people don't want leftover hot dogs without buns. But that's the kind of crap you're gonna be dealing with as you'll have to overbuy crystals in order to get what you really want. It's just dirty business practice.\n\n*(updated) It looks like they have some straight cash bundles on steam now, which is a good start. Let's hope they stay there*\n\nBut still, I think the enjoyment I had in the game outweighed my annoyances. But just marginally. It being a FTP game made that so. I also would've listed that lacking playerbase as a negative since it's so hard to find a match, but with this being released on steam, it will hopefully fix that. That, and they are promising to implement a card auction/trading system, so hopefully that'll also fix the card issues just as long as they don't milk you. It is only early access, and they are probably going to listen to their community so that some of these issues are fixed. If they have good sense, anyway.\n\nSo all-in-all, I think you should give this game a shot and see if it's for you, just as long as what I listed doesn't bother you. It's still fun and a decent time-waster that'll put your brain to work. And my brain certainly needs work.","April 23, 2014","true","3.2"," 56 of 94 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","56","94","0","5"

There is nothing really wrong with the combat or strategy, but more with the intensity, or in this case, lack there of. If you play this game, I hope you don't have any plans for about the next hour, not because you'll be playing many rounds of this because it's so addicting, but more because it's so slow. I have never been so bored playing a game before. It takes the computer about 10 seconds at least to make a move, when it takes me about 2-5 at most. Many other games (like Civilization) will decide what move to make in about 1 second. When it was my opponents turn, I basically went on YouTube and watch some videos, just to arrive like 5 minutes later to see that my opponent is still moving. My next problem, isn't anything to do with the combat or action, but the game in it's entirety. I found this game to be extremely similar in concept and design, to Mojang's game "Scrolls", scaringly similar. But, let's assume this game has no relation to "Scrolls" at all. My only other complaint is that there is no way to adjust the sound or music. Yes, you can "enable" and "disable" it, but no meter or slide to let you increase or decrease audio to your liking. In the end, I'd have to give this game a 4/10, and that's being a little nice. The slow-paced combat just takes so much out of the game, and the resembalence to "Scrolls" is a bit concerning. However, this game is "free to play", and it doesn't take up a lot of space on your computer. So, I'd say, install the game, play it yourself, and if you don't like it, at least you didn't get ripped off by having to pay $20 or worse. If you like the game "Scrolls" you might enjoy this ... however you likely will not.","May 6, 2014","false","1.2"," 34 of 55 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","34","55","0","4"

It's a good turn-based, strategy game on a grid. The gameplay is reminiscent of Final Fantasy Tactics, so definitely check it out if you loved FFT mechanics and wished it was online and multiplayer.  The battle system is easy enough to pick up and a fun challenge to master.\n\nI do have some beef with this game. It's still in the beta stage, so I experienced a few bugs (inability to deploy in the middle of a match or a unit completely disappearing for no reason), but they were few and far between. Although the game is free-to-play, my main beef is that you will need some 'dinero' to compete seriously.\n\nOverall, it's a good tactical game and has the potential of being a great tactical game.

The bad reviews for this game almost made me pass it up and that would truly have been a shame because I would have missed out on such a gem.\n\nThis game has everything.  Upgradeable cards, asynchronious play,  a good mix of ccg and board game elements, and a micro- reward system.  Every turn you play you get something.  It might be some gold or some clan experience(which lets you craft better clan specific units), crafting material or even a random card.\n\nYes, there is some pay to win aspects.  However, all content can be bought with in game currency so it will just take you a bit longer to get something if you don't want to pay.  From what I see it does not cause an imbalance.  I have not paid a cent and  have played 10 games so far and have won 9 of them.  The other downside is that the playerbase is small right now.

First of all, the payed features are mostly fair in that almost all parts of the game are acessible for free, albeit with a bit of playtime. I got the game yesterday, I play for free, and I'm already 267 on the leaderboards, so you can't really say it's pay to win. Second, it was stated on the conquest of champions announcements forum that all the heros would be available for free after the beta. So the pay features will become free after beta.\nNow that I've cleared up that little tid bit, let's talk about the gameplay. The game is a very fun, and doing well for being in beta. There are a decent amount of cards out right now, and more to be released soon(I'm fairly sure by the end of the month, I could be wrong.) There are a couple of issues such as servers bugging out every once in a while, and the fact that the community is a bit small right now, but other than that, the game is very well made.

The tutorial and practice mode aren't great so you do have to put SOME effort into learning how to play the game yourself (people tend to be happy to offer advice too). And off course you have to be somewhat competent at tactics games to begin with.\n\nAlso have no idea what kind of matchmaking problems people were talking about but they appear to have been solved. The game only ever paired me with people roughly equal in rank.\nAs for time...most quick matches take about 20-30 minutes on average which I don't find excessively long for a turn based game.\n\nAnd a little bit of advice for new players to start out with: Take the enhancements out of your starter deck as soon as possible and replace them with whatever free soldiers or spells you might have gotten (you get FREE CARDS just for playing the game, one free card, leveling component, gold reward or experience every TURN of the game you complete and five more at the end if you win).","September 2, 2014","true","100.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

So there's been alot of new updates, new expansion was released, lots of things changed, etc.\n\nThe UI of the game looks great, I can expect it to look fantastic later but it's a good improvement\nright now. There are rewards for playing everyday and milestones for tons of things like transforming\nyour hero x amount of times, killing this and that x amount of times, etc. I find quick matches pretty much instantly, extended match still takes awhile but you can just queue a bunch of times and they will most likely be filled up within a day. The game lets you buy heroes and card packs with in-game\ncurrency now so you don't NEED to spend money! They also give crystals as rewards which is great!\nOverall, this game is just getting better and better and it's still unfinished.\n\nI'd recommend this game to any fan of Strategy games.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n\nDisregard what's written below, that is a review from a long long long time ago when the game was\nnearly released.\n\nThis game is absolutely amazing. In its Early Access version, there are bugs but many players including me post on the forums about what's up and the devs quickly try to get everything fixed. There's currently 2 modes you can play which is 'quick match' and 'extended match'. Quick matches are timed and usually end within 10-30 minutes. Extended matches last days because once you take your turn you can log out or do something else until your opponent takes their turn. I love logging in everyday to take my turn for 20-40 extended matches. It just gives me something more to do everyday. There are currently 3 factions in this game each with 2 different Heroes of each faction and tons of units to select from. You choose a hero and 29 other cards to fill your deck with because 30 is the minimum deck amount but of course you can have a 100 card deck if you wanted to. You get a reward for each turn you take in the game whether it's a card, gold to buy from the store or faction XP to level up or a crafting material which is used to craft cards for each faction. Separating my collection of cards into different decks and testing them is really satisfying and it makes me want to play more. The devs are working hard on the expansion for the game which has more cards and heroes I think and it will be so exciting as this game develops. The community for this game is great too, there's no trash-talking, just friendly chatting and fun.\n\nI'd recommend this game to any fan of Strategy games.","April 23, 2014","true","339.4"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","1"

It's one of the most balanced CCG games i've played in a while with the free decks being just as good as the bought ones if played right. E.G. Free heros have cheaper but weaker units so can rush effectively early game but the bought ones have more expensive and powerful units which can win out over numbers if played right. But the free/bought argument isn't so much of an issue as in every game i've played i've earned at least 1 card during game play and if you win you get another 5 random cards, so as you play you can build and edit your decks. You also earn gold which can be spent on new heros and decks, it accumulates slowly around 50-100 per match i've found but you can get rewarded with more as you level up/play the game daily.\n\nThe drawback I've found so far is that there isn't a trading system implemented yet, which is a shame but they do plan on adding that to the game. But apart from that it looks like it'll turn out to be a pretty good game aslong as they keep content from all expansions available to F2P players and keep it balanced. =)","October 8, 2014","true","60.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I don't like the business model at all, and I'm not talking about the ability to buy cards/decks/in-game currency with real money, that's expected, but just the way it's setup forces you to pay extra for specific things you want so they can get a little extra money (a lot of games do this, but it's still unacceptable to me imo). Scroll down further for a brief explanation of gameplay if you just don't care about my gripes with the way the purchases are setup.\n\nHere is the current tier (gems are the premium in-game currency to buy things like decks):\n$2 = 12 gems\n$5 = 35 gems\n$15 = 120 gems\n$35 = 320 gems\n\nSo how much do hero decks and card packs cost?\n6 card pack (3 common, 2 uncommon, 1 "mine" card) = 10 gems\n"Deluxe" 7 card pack (1 rare, 2 uncommon, 3 common, 1 mine) = 25 gems\n\nNot too bad there right? Slightly cheaper than real life booster packs.\n\nHero decks which include a hero card and around 30 other cards (it varies) cost 40 gems. Already I hate this just because there is no gem tier where you can buy this with, you either have to spend 7 dollars or 15 dollars. To me this is a shady tactic to try and get people to spend more money since you get more for your money as the price goes up.\n\nAside from that though, each Hero deck varies quite a bit but are priced the same which makes no sense to me. For example, Krak Ironbark and Declan Ravenshoe come with 34 cards each, only 4 uncommon cards and the rest common. Blight Mistmantle comes with 36 cards, 7 which are uncommon and 2 rare. The cards aren't random so I'm not sure why they are all priced equally. Either way, it just rubs me the wrong way.\n\nYou can also buy gold, the normal in-game currency for real money too.\n12 gems = 6k\n35 gems = 17.5k\n120 gems = 60k\n320 gems = 160k\n\nThere is a normal card pack with 5 randoms that's 1000 gold, aside from that I'm not sure if there's anything else you can spend gold on. Crafting and fusion doesn't appear to take gold, this may change later. This might be a huge disadvantage for people who can't or don't want to spend real money. 5 dollars for 17 card packs with gold seems quite significant.\n\n====================\n\nGameplay\nThe overall idea is pretty neat. You deploy cards as units on a battlefield, there are spawnpoints you can capture so you can deploy cards closer to the enemy, you can capture mines to increase your resource generation, your hero card can... "transcend" into whatever if you accumulate enough extra resources (ones you don't use get added to your hero, you need 10 to transcend). I say transcend in quotes because I was expecting something epic to happen, I'm not sure ANYTHING happened visually because I couldn't see any difference. I may have blinked and missed it and it was so similar that it didn't look like anything happened, or nothing simply happened and it just gained an extra ability/damage.\n\nThere are some interesting card combos as the undead so far and I haven't run into many issues aside from the tutorial freezing when loading level 2 and having to start over again. Luckily they're short.\n\nAs of right now there are only 70 players online, the nice thing is that you can have matches over the course of several hours or days and Steam will notify you when it's your turn. This is a cool mechanic that you don't see too often in games. The only thing I can think of off the top of my head that still does this are probably facebook games like scrabble, and I know a few rts games might still do this. You can play live as well.\n\nMatchmaking might be a huge issue for some people. I honestly don't know if there is any matchmaking at all beyond simply pairing you up with completely random people out of everyone who's online. Matches can take quite a long time, the timer for each move is around 2 minutes 30 seconds and most of the time either you or your opponent will use up most of that timer (at least when you start out, I'm sure later you will go through turns faster). Another cool thing during matches though is that you seem to get random cards or gold or exp after every turn. I'm not sure how great of a card you can get but it's still nice.\n\n====================\nOverall thoughts\nOverall, it's pretty fun and I do like the idea, however, I can't speak much about the matchmaking and that sort of stuff because 80-90% of the people online are complete newbies so you're likely to face off against one of them. That means I have no idea if the match making is good or bad until it makes me play against someone that's obviously way higher ranked. I also can't speak about how the in-game purchases with real money affect the game overall. To me it is a bit concerning so I would be cautious about it.\n\nThe game is a very small install, I think 200-300mb, so it's at the very least worth a try if the gameplay sounds interesting to you. It might be a good game to play casually using the extended match feature, but I can't imagine how long those would take to complete if my first game took me around an hour to finish.\n\n====================\n\n(Initially I was going to give this a "No" for the recommendation, at the last minute I am changing it to a yes just because there is plenty to like about it and it's such a small download that it's at least worth a TRY. For long term or serious play I don't think I could recommend it, so make your own decision based on this and other reviews.\nI obviously haven't played it that long, maybe after more games and 5-10 hours of gameplay my recommendation could easily turn into a solid "No" but I don't think I will play it that long and I don't feel like it's fair to not recommend the game based off of assumptions of what the game will be like 5 hours from now, whether that means discovering the match making sucks or it's too "pay to win")","May 10, 2014","true","3.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It abled me to do alot more then with out it, I highly recommend buying it. IF you plan on playing this game. Also it might not be a pay 2 win game.

It's a decent strategy game. A lot more tactics than some other free card type games, that's for sure. The game feels 'slow' to me, the sounds effects and music are kinda generic, though the quality is high. The various concept arts used in pictures is nice, but the in game models are cartoon-ish(not a negative comment btw) and I don't really like the style. I do, however, like the resource management in this game, where you have 5-ish Gold Mines(you can capture more) that generate resources for you that are used for casting cards. Units must also be cast on special summoning tiles. You start with 3, but can capture more. Oh, and by capturing more Mines/Spawns, there are neutral ones in the center, and you can capture your opponents.\n\nThere's single-player practice opponents you can play against, and a great tutorial in my opinion. It covers all the details you need, but does it quickly without the rushed feeling. The speed part is what most games have trouble with.\n\nMultiplayer wise, there's a 'Live Battle' and a 'Extended/Asynchronous Battle'. Live match is like it sounds: 2 people join and play a game. Extended is basically the 'pass-wait-play' model that mobile multiplayer games use, where you take your turn, a message is sent to your opponent telling them to get the lead out of their ♥♥♥(take their turn), then it's sent back to you. You can take as much time as you want(within reason), while Live mode is timed.This is great for people with busy lives or unstable connections, where they can play a whole game with someone without having to worry about time. It even has a option with steam where you can take your turn, turn it off, and Steam will tell you when it's your turn. This can be turned off if you don't want it.\n\nRegardless of my neutral feelings for the game, it's free, and everyone who likes strategy games should definitely try it out.\n\nP.S: I didn't spend enough time to judge the Microtransactions, but it doesn't look P2W. Booster packs are rather cheap-ish, and playing games, winning or losing, gives you enough gold to buy Packs often enough. Also, completing the numerous daily challenges also nets you with a decent amount of cards, so I really don't think it's P2W. Yet at least.\n\nIt didn't bug me about buy Crystals, the currency bought with real money. The shop itself is pretty low key also.","April 23, 2014","true","0.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

They've solved pretty much all of the root causes that created problems in Pox, and they've deepened the strategy to boot. The visual style is not to my personal liking, but the game more than makes up for it in my eyes.\n\nAnd for people that never played Pox Nora: This is how CCGs should be made. Plain and simple. There's a strategic depth here that you will not find in any other game, and a tactical depth that is just about as immense. Give it a try! It can be played without spending a dime, so checking it out is really bloody simple. That said, if you want to invest any significant time and effort into it you should probably consider at least a buy-in big enough to get a few additional heroes.\n\nPros:\n- Strategic and tactical depth on a level you will not find anywhere else\n- The "extended game" play mode that lets you take turns when you have time.\n- Ability to play the game on an even level with either no, or very small, monetary investment\n- A development team that are ridiculously quick at fixing bugs that the players report (as in, a couple of days)\n\nCons:\n- The visual style is kind of meh\n- Still in development, so plenty bugs for everyone\n- Rather shallow card pool for now. First expansion isn't that far off though, so not a real con.\n- The amount of actual work you'll get done is in severe jeopardy.

I don't like the business model at all, and I'm not talking about the ability to buy cards/decks/in-game currency with real money, that's expected, but just the way it's setup forces you to pay extra for specific things you want so they can get a little extra money (a lot of games do this, but it's still unacceptable to me imo). Scroll down further for a brief explanation of gameplay if you just don't care about my gripes with the way the purchases are setup.\n\nHere is the current tier (gems are the premium in-game currency to buy things like decks):\n$2 = 12 gems\n$5 = 35 gems\n$15 = 120 gems\n$35 = 320 gems\n\nSo how much do hero decks and card packs cost?\n6 card pack (3 common, 2 uncommon, 1 "mine" card) = 10 gems\n"Deluxe" 7 card pack (1 rare, 2 uncommon, 3 common, 1 mine) = 25 gems\n\nNot too bad there right? Slightly cheaper than real life booster packs.\n\nHero decks which include a hero card and around 30 other cards (it varies) cost 40 gems. Already I hate this just because there is no gem tier where you can buy this with, you either have to spend 7 dollars or 15 dollars. To me this is a shady tactic to try and get people to spend more money since you get more for your money as the price goes up.\n\nAside from that though, each Hero deck varies quite a bit but are priced the same which makes no sense to me. For example, Krak Ironbark and Declan Ravenshoe come with 34 cards each, only 4 uncommon cards and the rest common. Blight Mistmantle comes with 36 cards, 7 which are uncommon and 2 rare. The cards aren't random so I'm not sure why they are all priced equally.

I gave the developers $19.99 when this game 1st came on Steam, and there was talk of making people pay again for an "expansion" while the game is STILL to this day in beta. The whole moneymaking sceme of this game turned me off and I quit playing because of it. I see they gave the "expansion" content to people that paid for the pack that I did, but the damage was done already in my case, cause I'd be damned if I gave them 20 bucks for a game still in beta, and then have them try to charge me again for an "expansion" while the game was still IN beta...if a game is in beta...its not an EXPANSION...its adding more content for the official release. When I paid for Minecraft, they didnt say...oh! we are putting horses in the game...but only if you pay us another 20 bucks before release. There was some good strategy involved in playing this game, and it was decent, but since the talk of a paid "expansion" while still in beta, I havent touched this game on principle, so even though they added the content in question to those that paid, the developers can take my 20 bucks, but also my bad review, and the fact I'm unable to recommend the game with the glimpses into the plans they had rolling in their heads about how to make the most money they could before the game was even out...Here's a tip...if you need money for development of a game, dont make early access FREE TO PLAY, make the finished product free to play, and give the people that paid you money early, some kind of bonus for backing your project. I followed this game early, the plans the developers had, and what they saw for the future, it wasn't a pretty picture for people paying to play it, and the incentive to pay wasn't there...so just go F2P on this one, and take out of it what you can, while you can, cause I dont see this game being around very long if they try to screw the people giving them money to cater to the free to play people who whine about the game being pay to win.","October 19, 2014","false","130.9"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","12","24","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dhirvish/recommended/266450/","Dhirvish","Wakko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dhirvish/","42 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHighly recommend.  I hope to be playing this one for a long time.  Turn based card/chess game.\n\nPros\n-Very easy to pick up, I felt like an adequate player after a handful of games\n-standard pve 'practice mode'\n-'quick match' feature which is like speed chess, you've got 2 minutes to a turn.  EVERY turn you and your opponent get in-game cash, upgrade tokens for your cards, XP OR new card.  Huge motivator to play these ranked games.\n-LIMITED movement.  You don't get to move every single peice each turn, you've got a set number of 'actions' you can do each turn, so around mid-game you have to start parsing them out wisely to your pieces and choose which abilities to use strategically.  Combine this with huge boards, a mana pool where any overflow POWERS your hero's 'special' power and you've got limitless strategies and counter strategies.\n-Ranking system of course\n-You can 'level' up your cards by sacrificing other extra cards or special cards which are only used for that purpose.  I've got half my deck leveled up to 2 a few hours into the game.  So this moves at a good pace and allows you to actually feel some progress.\n-Quests\n-The awesomely unique feature of this game is the 'extended game' mode, which is basically a shoutout to the old correspondence chess games.  You and your opponent take turns playing OFFLINE.  Meaning you can take as long as you want on a turn, then leave the game, and they'll be sent an email to either/both their steam account and/or registered email account.  Then they can login when they want to play.  3 days without a turn = forfeit.  Its a really nice option for a lot of the 25-50yr crowd who have jobs and don't have hours to sit and play\n\nCons\n-There is no 'practice' mode vs players.  This is a HUGE drawback as you can only test out a deck vs AI.\n-Limited number of players.  I only saw 20-40 players at a time, that was the full spectrum of all ranked, so that means youve only got max 10-15ish people at your level online at any given moment for a quick match.  There appear to be 1000+ people on the ranked boards.  Hard to tell.\n-Takes a LONG LONG time to get a new 'leader' which allows you to adjust your playstyle (I have 200 gold after several hours, it takes 3000-4000 for just one hero).  And I mean it may take weeks, so you're basically stuck with the deck you start with.  May want to read some reviews/forums before you pick one.  They need a 'discount' on the second leader you buy or gold needs to drop just a bit more frequently.\n-Takes a LONG time to buy any decent packs.  Can get the cheapo ones, but you may just end up with upgrades instead of usable cards.\n-1/3 of all cards that drop will be for the deck you are using.  The other 2/3 will be for the decks you can't use until you can buy a new hero.\n-Of the 1/3 cards that drop for your deck, I'm seeing maybe 1/5 to 1/10 that are NOT duplicates that you can't use, since you can use only 2 of each card.  Your deck grows very very slowly.\n-Heavy potential for pay to play.  But there are lots of opportunities to outsmart your opponent.\n-I'm not sure about the ranking system yet, my first match I was throw in with someone that had literally twice as many cards as I did.  I totally held my own, but given how few players there are online, I feel like this has the possibility of repeating itself too often.\n\nThe cons are frustratingly significant, but the actual games are diametrically just as great.  There's deep strategy in the placement of the actionable items on the board combined with spells, spawn nodes, playable cards, enchantments and your hero.  You need a LOT of patience, but I think it's worth it.  The upside also being that ALL the cons could be easily fixed/tweaked.  No clue how responsive devs are to feedback.  More players would honestly make a serious dent in the cons.","August 8, 2014","true","51.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The reason why is because this game is clearly a COMPLETE RIP-OFF of the "Heroes of Might and Magic" games, which are actually better, (even though they have to be bought, in order to be played) and of course, they don't make you spend money, just to play as another faction, than the one YOU JUST CHOSE.

BIG BUT...  the last patch ruined it.\n\n1. Pre spawned guys = total change to deck play and construction and even more advantage for player who goes first ...\n\n2. Changed new card aquisition.  Now you can only really have a chance at an exotic IF you spend really money.. .Pay to win anyone?\n\n3.  As a player who has almost every card and need just 2 or 3 more exotics to have them all I have virtually no hope of ever getting them... I will constantly get cards I already have lots of copies of.  As a new player YOU HAVE NO chance vs the old guard who already have the exotics...  unless you spend say 1000$ on gems...  yeah right...\n\nWilll check back in a few months to see if devs fix this colossal error.\n\nEWW\n\n\n\n\nWell I have been playing for about 3 weeks now.   Please remember the game is in BETA still so changes are being tried out and  adjustments are being made.  The Dev's have listened to the community.\n--The matchmaking is better.  Not perfect but improving.\n--After recent patch they quickly got feedback that income (mana) was too low and hot fixed it that day.\n\nYes if you spend a fortune in $$$ you will have good cards... That won't make you good.  In my first week and a half I lost games to guys with better cards not better strategy.  I did not have a rare or exotic card in my deck.  I still got to rank 37.\n\nToday I have built some good cards... Spent 20$ to support developement and have 3 competative decks...  As of writing this review I am ranked #1 (for last 2 days).\n\nThe game is NOT "pay to win"\nIt is fun.\nCrafting and Fusion (upgrading your cards) require you to play games to get materials.\n\nThe Extended mode is one of my favorite game types... load up 50 games vs a variety of opponents.  Play your turn and come back in a few hours play them again.  Best option for new players to get cards and experience.\n\nEWW","July 27, 2014","false","689.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You collect cards that can be units, items, or spells.  Use these cards on a battlefield grid against your opponent.  You move all your units and take actions in one round, then it's your opponent's move.  The goal is to kill their leader and destroy their shrine.  There are three factions to play (Dwarves, Elves, Demons) and each faction have multiple leaders and their distinct units and spells.\n\nLater on you can upgrade your unit cards up to five levels.
