Just to be able to walk around and look at the art style is enough for me It's absolutely beautiful. I'd love to see some clones of this art style work its way into other genres, because im really enjoying looking at it.\n\nAs far as the gameplay itself, i have to admit it does leave a bit to be desired. Theres nothing really wrong with it so far from what ive seen, but there isnt anything groundbreaking either. It is a simple shoot em up, with simple controls. Although i see there is a lot of upgrading that can be done to your ship so that may change later on in the game, there may just be tools to come that make the gameplay more complex.\n\nMy opinion is, if you're even the slightest bit interested, go ahead and grab it now while its on sale. Hell, grab it while its not on sale. $4? Extremely nice game for that price. AND it drops trading cards, so you could get a bit of that 3-4 dollars back if you wish","December 17, 2013","true","2.7"," 50 of 64 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","50","64","0","0"

Helping a character involves playing a level in the horizontal shooter.\nThere's a plot in this half, and it's not that bad actually. The Doodles are in a war with the geometrical Logicians and it is your job to find out what's going on with the Logicians and how to stop the war.\nThe main gripe with this segment is that the controls are very, very weird. With three control schemes available (keyboard, mouse and controller. Mouse being the default) you'd think there was something in there for everyone's tastes.\nJumping is floaty to the point where it's almost impossible to accurately steer where your little doodle guy is going. This isn't such a big deal at first, but for some reason the developers decided that precision platforming is exactly what would make the second half better.\n\nOn the horizontal shooter side\nThe first impression here is a lot better, which is good since this is the meat of the game.\nYou fly around in a little ship with 4 customizable parts (2 weapons, a hull and a type of special weapon with limited uses) destroying or dodging all enemies until you get to the boss of the level, that you then have to defeat. You then get Ink to spend on getting new parts and upgrading existing parts (Ink can also be earned in the platformer half, but has no use there).\nPricing on new gear is very high though, so you'll need to fly a lot of missions before you're able to get that heat seeking missile pod (not the ultimate weapon, just my personal favourite).\nThere's some finesse where some enemies have armour that can only be bypassed with melee weapons, so it's generally a good idea to bring one gun and one melee weapon.\nWhat frustrated me here is a minor detail, but one that I couldn't exclude here. The heat seeker missiles I mentioned are excellent when they work as intended, and are even capable of getting around those pesky melee-only shields. However, the targeting on them is way off. Missed enemies that are by now far behind you and out view, scenery, enemies that haven't spawned yet, everything gets targeted by it. This is more apparent on some levels than on others, but especially since it's such a late-game weapon where players will have had to save up Ink for dozens of missions, it just reeks of poor design and/or testing.\n\nBallpoint Universe isn't a bad game, but beyond the distinctive graphics there just isn't anything exceptional there.\nYou can enjoy it, but the same can be said more so of a lot of other games on offer.","September 1, 2014","false","9.8"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirUseless/recommended/259390/","SirUseless","Seabeast","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirUseless/","173 products in account","Ballpoint Universe is truly an astonishing game with a unique artstyle since everything in the game is drawn with a ballpoint pen! The graphics are so detailed and you can really see how much love and passion has gone into making the game. For this to be a game made by only three people, it's amazing.\n\nNow that I've gotten that covered let's talk a little bit about the key features and gameplay. The story isn't too linear and you can choose if you want to do a mission or not which is good because it means that you are not going to be stuck on a part just because you are unable to beat it. You can in a sense explore the hand drawn world freely just to admire the artstyle and graphics. The controls are pretty good although the mouse might sometimes bug out a bit but it doesn't seem to be such a huge deal. The game is a shoot-em-up adventure indie game and even though I don't consider myself a big shoot-em-up fan this is really quite enjoyable. The whole shoot-em-up aspect of the game is relatively well excecuted and it is fun blowing  evil doodles out of the sky.\nThere is a fair amount of customization/personalization of your spaceship and there seems to be a lot of different weapons and accessories. The currency ingame is ink which makes sense since that is what everyone and everything in the game is made of. The ink that you collect through missions can be used for things like weapons for your ship and spinning the wheel of fortune for more ink.\n\nAs for the story there is some but for the hardcore story fans it might be too little of it but this isn't the kind of game that would need a really heavy story. If I was to try and explain the story I would probably say that it is basically about a doodle who is helping his fellow doodles in the fight against the evil doodles which in the game are called Logicians.\nThe game also features some great relaxing music and even though the tracks are pretty repetetive you don't want to turn it off.\n\nIt costs barely anything and you could easily get several hours out of it. Even though I haven't dived into it too deeply yet I can see myself playing it for more than a few hours when I get the chance. Even if you aren't quite sure if you want to buy it or not you should really consider it since it really is an experience to say the least. Innovative games like this one is what makes me love indie titles as much as I do.\n\nI won't deny that the game has a few flaws but I believe that even the harshest critic could have a really good time if you try to see what the game does well instead of what it does badly.\n\nAn overall great game and for the little money that you spend on it, you get enough out of it that it kind of is a must buy for almost everyone.\n\n- Liam","December 29, 2013","true","1.8"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

From the odd mix of 80% shootemup and 20% adventure platforming, the awkward controls that you need to get used to and the odd but cutely presented story and characters that come with it. My wife really liked the main character, but was questioning her nose. At the start it all is a bit confusing cause it’s not often you start a game like that, to be honest I think that was the 1st game of this kind I ever played to begin with and I really enjoyed the game as a whole. It's not too hard or easy, the weapon and ship upgrades are numerous and feel pretty unique (by design anyway). It's fun to see the uses for each item “even the crappy ones” and just start collecting everything while finishing the rather short storyline. Plenty of replay ability if you want to get each and every achievement, as long as you don't mind some repetitiveness. I think the story mode could have done with one or two more worlds though, but it's enough for its price (and budget, I presume). Just the pleasure of looking at all worlds which created the artist (developer) is worth it all.","December 10, 2014","true","7.6"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/259390/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2002 products in account","Well, this one really caught me by surprise. When I first saw Ballpoint Universe - Infinite on Steam Greenlight it didn't really caught my attention but the more I saw it on several youtube videos and some gaming website news the more I got fond of the artstyle, slowly I started developing a certain "appreciation" for the fact that everything on the game was hand drawn. Then when I got the game and finally played I was completely blown away by it, the way that the 2D sprites that were completely hand drawn and the way the animations were made really fitted the world and the background and everything felt really smooth. You can say that Ballpoint Universe is both a platformer and a sidescrolling shooter, like something like Syder Arcade. You control your little doll with the mouse, and let me warn you, it is kinda frustrating at the begining because your character moves towards where you have the cursor so in certain parts where high precision platforming is required you might fail a few times until you get the hang of it. Now, the shooting part is where you'll spend most of your time probably, at the begining of each stage you get to equip, upgrade or buy parts for your ship. Your ship has 4 slots, one on the top which starts out with a blade that activates when you're next to an enemy, one on the bottom which at first has a machine gun that fires in short bursts, one which is the hull of the ship and the last one is your active ability which you can use after you kill a certain number of enemies and you "build" up your star counter, it basicly works like a combo system. By upgrading your weapons you get increased range, bigger spread, bigger magazines / faster reload time, by upgrading your hull you can get various benefits such as increased health, homing missiles etc and by upgrading your active ability I believe it only improves the performance of that ability. These upgrades and new parts can be acquired by spending ink which is the game currency and you can get it by killing enemies, destroying obstacles and achieving a higher rank on a mission. Each mission has 3 ranks which you can get by completing them, if you don't die a single time during that mission or if you recover a life you'll end the mission with 5 lifes and that will give you the gold rank, having atleast lifes by the end of the mission will grant you the silver rank and 1 life will grant you the bronze rank. If I recall correctly the bronze rank gives you 100 ink while the silver rank gives you 200 ink and the gold rank gives you a collectible, which as the name indicates, you can collect either by getting gold rank on all the missions and by finding some hidden in the levels.  The shooting gameplay is fairly standard but yet really satisfying, your melee weapon triggers as soon as you get in range of an enemy or obstacle and by left clicking you trigger your ranged weapon and eventually when you build up your star meter the middle mouse button will trigger your special ability, usually by the end of the mission you will fight a boss and as the game progresses the game throws at you more and more enemies which you can either kill or completly avoid. Overall I think that where the game really shines is it's graphical presentation, the soundtrack (which is really good, dare I say Electronic Super Joy level of awesomeness) and the plot. I do realize that the plot might not be that interesting for some people because it's really kind of weird but I do believe that given the graphic style chosen by the developer it makes sense and it really fits together. That said I honestly think this is a very good game which surprised me alot, I wasn't really expecting this to be this polished and really well put together, it certainly is a must play for indie games fans and art enthusiasts.","January 20, 2014","true","4.7"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","19","26","0","3"

They were just really wonky no matter what settings I used. The gamepad joystick was too sensitive for the shooting parts, but not sensitive enough on the menus. And the mouse controls were horrible for the platforming bits.\n\nThe platforming bits seemed unnecessary. Why not just give us a menu-based level hub instead of constantly shifting between two types of gameplay?\n\nThe shoot em parts were quite fun, but felt like they could have been done a lot better. The worst part was how often enemies would go off screen. If enemies go off screen in a shooter, they’re not supposed to come back!! But in this game, they do, quite often. Most of the enemy movement patterns depended on your movement, so you often had to move in a way that would keep them on screen. That’s pretty annoying.\n\nAnyway, I played the game for the artstyle, and it surely delivered on unique graphics. The melee weapons on your ship were fun too. But overall I wasn’t too impressed.","June 24, 2014","false","2.1"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","1"

This game plays like a shmup( Shoot them up) if you're not familiar with games where you're a spaceship to destrory enemy planes or aliens. But what's unique about the game is everything is done in Ballpoint; you're always introduced to new and vibrant art that keeps coming in your face. When I first played this game, I was confused either to say if it was a platformer and a shmup. I feel like the platforming sections are really weak and presents a flaw when you're trying to go to many platforms. Controls don't feel tight so you have to rely on your mouse or keyboard/game pad for the jumping sections. The game works as you collect inkblots to upgrade, buy new parts to your ship which adds a lot of customization to how you want to approach things. You want a sword and gun combo? Done. You want to protect yourself and use missiles? Done. You just want to go commando and use dual melee or guns? Sure thing. Its very rewarding when you upgrade because it helps with ranking on missions. I recommend this to anyone who wants to try it out, the game can keep you playing for hours and it's not entirely hard ( The wheel can give you 40k inkblots if you're having trouble) if you're new.","June 29, 2014","true","7.6"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","Perhaps if this was solely a horizontal sidescrolling shoot 'em up and not half a 2D platformer with somewhat awkward controls & somewhat difficult to navigate areas this would be an alright game.\n\nThe parts where it's a shooter work okay for the most part. Controls are all with the mouse by default and allows quick movement from one end of the screen to another. As you kill baddies in said shooter you're supposed to collect "ink" to upgrade and buy new items & modifications for your ship. It can be a bit of a challenge of its own to get said ink because they're around enemies & gunfire often and they disappear fairly quickly so you can't necessarily wait for them to come to you all that much. The upgrades and items you buy for the ship with the ink really come in handy though from what I found the guns that spew bullets are extremely weak even when upgraded to the max. To sort of compensate for that you also get a heavy-damage-dealing melee weapon that automatically attacks whatever's in front of the ship so should they come within range. It adds a bit more depth to the gameplay; you can either keep shooting while easily seeing something that can kill you at a safe distance or get close for faster kills while figuring out when to back off when it looks like the ship's in a dangerous spot.\nThere are a good chunk of shooter levels in this game but unfortunately I found out that I'd have to do a series of very lackluster 2D platforming to even unlock these levels, which is what ruins this game for me.\n\nThere's hardly anything to the platforming; jump over here, jump that pit, talk to this person to MAYBE unlock an actual shooter level. By default you use the mouse to run, jump, and interact which feels very awkward to play with. You can set it in the pause menu to move around via the keyboard instead (which works a lot better) however when you're about to get to the shooter levels there's a good chance you'll want to switch back to the mouse controls, at least I did since I got to be more precise with the mouse during those levels.\nNavigating and just plain running around through the platforming areas is a tedious task of its own. Anything important you get to do is often a bit of a ways off and the artstyle, though pretty cool, I think makes navigating a lot more confusing, espcially when running to the foreground and background.\n\nIt's not something I'd want to finish if it means going through a lot of tedious platforming that hardly rewards much.","July 10, 2015","false","3.8"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

However, it's not like most of the classics. While there are plenty of bullets to dodge, pinpoint movements to make, and crazy bosses to beat, this game adds in a few things that make the genre a bit easier to swallow for the less skilled players... like me.\n\nThis game helps ease the difficulty of the genre by giving you upgrades rather than powerups. Basically, when you destroy enemies, they drop ink. You collect the ink and use it as currency in the shops between rounds. In these shops, you can buy and equip parts to your ship, with a total of four parts. There are two weapon slots, one for the top and one for the bottom. There's also a wing slot, which is generally a passive ability, and also a nose slot, which is a special weapon that you have to build up power for. You build up that power by killing enemies in a row without getting hit. The weapon slots are interesting because there are three basic weapon types: guns, shields, and melee weapons. Guns are obviously projectiles. These are good for ranged combat but enemies with shields will block bullets. That's where melee weapons come in. Melee weapons break shields and generally do decent damage, but they are rather slow and require you to get close enough to the enemy to use them, which can get you killed on the quicker enemies. Shields are used for blocking and/or deflecting enemy fire. These are especially good in levels with lots of firing foes. Each type has their use and knowing which works best for you and for the situation will help you complete the missions. Also, buying new items and upgrades will grant you aillies. There is a gun ally, nose ally, and wing ally, each with their own passive benefits. Once you get them you keep them for good and can level them up a bit as well. All of this gives you an incentive to keep playing because even if a mission is really hard, you can always get more items and upgrades to help you, as well as customize yourself differently for new strategies.\n\nThere are also 2D platforming parts of the game. This is where you will travel the overworld. Basically, at the start of the game you can try out infinite space, an endless mode of fighting enemies until you die. This is a nice way to experiement and extend the gameplay, but you'll want to explore the overworld more for the actual missions. By talking to NPCs scattered throughout the overworld, you can be sent on missions. There's a vague story attached to these missions, but it generally boils down to fighting off swarms of enemies in different locations. Once you complete any mission, it is then selectable from your pause menu, so you don't have to explore the vast overworld every time you want to do them again. Also in this overworld are golden sketches that you can collect. They are often hidden, though sometimes are carried by NPCs. Also, some are unlocked by completing the missions without losing a life. Others... I'm not even sure how to get. Either I missed them or it's not clear what to do to get them so... I don't know what to tell you other than... sorry. However, I DO want to make it clear, this doesn't exactly make this a hybrid game. It's still a space shooter. These overworld segments are just for the purpose of story, finding missions, and collecting sketches. There are some parts where you'll need to talk to people, do some platforming, and can even die... but you respawn at one of the many checkpoints and ultimately there are only so many ways to go. It's fun and interesting, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it part of the gameplay. It's more like a big and stylized interactive menu.\n\nI also want to mention the presentation here. All of the game is gone from drawings from a ballpoint pen... at least from what I've heard and gathered. This is something you can really appreciate if you ever used to doodle at all. It reminds me a lot of some of the stuff I'd draw on the sides of my papers in school when I was younger. This is where the overworld shines, actually. There are a lot of things out there. Different characters, environments, and backgrounds create visuals that are simple yet pleasingly detailed. The music in the game is actually pretty cool, giving a quirky yet energetic vibe. And the character monologues are weird and goofy in a way that doesn't feel like they're trying too hard. It all comes together in an interesting and unique experience. But, as you know, there are always downsides.\n\nThis game doesn't have many downsides, but it has a few. Let's start with the minor ones. There IS controller support... but for some reason the game only detects ONE specific slot for it... where my mouse was plugged in. Kind of annoying with the placement, but not a big deal. Also, getting all the gold medals on the missions is mostly doable with certain items and setups and you really feel like you can eventually get there... except for one. On one particular mission, the challenge does NOT come from enemies and your ship loadout. Instead, the challenge comes from dodging parts of the environment that will kill you on contact... and they move. Now, there aren't a lot of parts for that and it's nowhere near impossible, but it just doesn't fit with the rest of the game. It tests your skills in flying, not your planning for combat. One actual downside worth noting is that, while you are encouraged to customize your ship in order to counter specific challenges, you don't HAVE to strategically plan your builds. I got through most of the game using the two weakest guns, and I managed to beat the game with the setup of two gun. It's nice to have the freedom to play how you want, but it also takes away some of the value of having different setups. It's not so much about strategy and planning as it is about finding the setup you like the most. Also, having the missions spread out over the overworld, and the overworld segments in general, were a bit out of place. They felt like annoying padding at times. Not that I didn't enjoy the overworld and characters and exploration. I did. But forcing you to do 2D platforming to unlock horizontal space shooting levels of actual gameplay is not the most convenient choice.\n\nOverall, Ballpoint Universe - Infinite is a lot of fun. It gives a lot of replayability with the different ship builds and upgrades. It has an interesting and appealing style. The real kicker is that it's only four bucks! It's hours of fun for just four bucks and it's worth it. If you like horizontal space shooters with progression and customizaion, check it out. Ballpoint Universe - Infinite gets a 7/10. (And yes, that's good.)","February 14, 2015","true","10.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The game is a shooter, with some platforming/exploring bits in between areas.\n\nBallpoint Universe would be a bit on the easy side for shooter fans, but as a shooter-unsavvy gamer, the difficulty was about right for me.  The levels are fairly short, which makes dying and having to restart a level non-frustrating.  Overall, even with a few deaths per level, I made steady progress and never felt a level was unfair.\n\nYou can upgrade and customize your ship using Ink that you collect from destroyed enemies. The different weapons feel varied, and for some levels it makes sense to perhaps not use your usual kit, and change it up (eg. I found it useful on occasion to equip two melee weapons instead of melee + gun. I never bothered with shields, but that's another option if you like playing in that style).  The grind was minimal in terms of getting good enough equipment to finish the game, but if you want to upgrade EVERYTHING, you'll be in the game quite a while.\n\nIn addition to the story mode, there's an Infinite mode where you can see how long you can last. Also, once you pass a level in Story mode you can revisit that level any time from the Start screen and try to do better. There's enough there to keep you busy.\n\nOn the other hand, I found the platforming fairly frustrating due to the weird controls and collision-detection. Luckily here's no consequence for dying by falling off edges, otherwise I might have given up early on. I found using the mouse nigh-impossible for the platform parts, and ended up using an XBox 360 controller (which I recommend for both the platformer and shooter parts).\n\nAs mentioned before, the game is beautiful (and prompted me to whip out the F12 button for the first time on Steam ;) ). As an illustrator/game dev myself, my kudos to the artist for creating such a lovely-looking gameworld. The music is also very good and fits the game perfectly.\n\nIf you're looking for a casual shooter you can dip into to have a short game once in a while, you can't go wrong with $4 for Ballpoint Universe.","January 16, 2014","true","10.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

Lemur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nalgasdlemur/","949 products in account","I was pleasantly surprised by how much fun I had with this. I'd heard that it was a great looking game that was kind of meh in the gameplay department, but I thought it was a fairly competent shmup. There's nothing particularly novel in terms of mechanics or level/enemy design, but there are enough different loadout options to let you make it suit any playstyle, and that's where the aesthetics kick in to keep it interesting too.\n\nIt's definitely on the easy side, so I took advantage of the loadout system to set a self-imposed challenge for myself and decided to see if I could play through a shmup without shooting/using any active abilities. The melee weapons are all auto-triggered when you're close enough to be within range, and I just ignored the special abilities entirely that require you to push a button to activate them. It turns out the weapons and other equipment in the game are balanced well enough that it's entirely possible to do that and play through the game using nothing other than movement, so good on them for that.\n\nAlthough speaking of movement, that's one of the problems with the game. Between stages in campaign mode (there's also infinite arcade mode) there are minor platforming segments to get to the next level where you can talk to NPCs and find out more about the story and retry levels and whatnot. The platforming is COMPLETE BALLS no matter what input device you're using. The collision detection is kinda broken (just try jumping while standing next to a wall), you will flop over and slide off moving platforms when you jump onto them (have fun at the end of the game), and so on. I sincerely hope they never make a platform game.\n\nDefinitely recommend a controller for it, but if not, at least use your keyboard for the platforming bits. The main shmup part is playable with whatever you're comfortable with, but the platforming is awkward with a controller, quite annoying with a keyboard, and borderline impossible with a mouse.","January 26, 2014","true","11.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's very awkward to control, there's too much acceleration going on everywhere, you have to change control modes constantly and the physics feel that everything is about to collapse at any second.\n\nBut I persevered, and after getting used to it's controls, I found myself liking it a lot. I love arcade shmups, and after figuring out how to buy weapons and equiping them, shooting sections very fun, although I found them too easy at first, I was having a blast in the later sections. There's no way you'll have enough ink to buy all weapons and try them without grinding, so I stuck to the ones I know I would liked and upgraded them to the max. Also, ♥♥♥♥ kamikazes, one touch and you lose a life, no matter how much you have.\n\nPersonally, I would've liked a score system, which also could have alleviated the frustration of losing a life trying to get a gold by gaining one after hitting certain number. It would be a nicer bonus for your skill than having a star that makes a short blast of bullets.\n\nAlso, the graphics are very unique and cool, but sometimes I feel this game is kind of egotistical, shoving them in your face. This is really a problem with a boss that shows up in front of the camera and blocks your view of the enemies, I dont mind it too much in the overworld, but it can be annoying. The opnly other graphical problem is in the last level, when all the objects being white becomes a problem, there were times that I didnt know where I was, what was attacking me and where it came from.\n\nAnd lastly, I think that the game would be better if it had less focus on the overworld, specially platforming in there, and different music.

Either bounding box issues or, again, the wack controls (and/or just something about the jump trajectory envelope) make it seem cheap and low-tech, like a phone game, or a flash game, as you are constantly denied on fundamental jumps.\n\nCool and fun, until it's not.

It's artwork isn't "beautiful" but still charming and occasionally complicatedly pretty. It's all sketchy and papery. Real cool. A lot of stylized designs like Monty Python animation or different cartoony styles.\n\nAhem, anyways. This is a SHMUP. But it's really interesting. You run around in a 2D platforming area, occasionally finding collectables, but mostly just talking to people and accepting missions. Once you accept a mission, you launch up to a brief (or long) SHMUP section, collecting ink, that ends in a boss and are graded and rewarded based on how many lives you have at the end of it (1 is Bronze, 3 is Silver, 5 is Gold). There is also an "Endless Space" area you can go to at any time as long as you have the units of payment for it and it's pretty much a place to collect ink for upgrades. You start where you left off or died last time in neverending waves of enemies.\n\nThe upgrades and combat is where it actually is a bit different than standard SHMUP fare. You have a top and a bottom weapon, a nose which determines your overload ability which you get by killing enemies without being hit for an extended period, and a body which determines health and passives your ship has. What's cool is that a lot of the weapons aren't standard fare. There are three main types; projectiles, melee and shields.\n\nProjectiles are your bullet weapons and are actually quite varied. There's one that fires in diagonals, one that fires a buckshot cluster that spreads as it gets further away, one that fires a slow shot that pierces and so on. They really vary it up a lot.\n\nMelee is where the game gets really interesting. Melee attacks mean you have to get your ship close to the enemies. They are generally much stronger than projectiles, but as a result are more risky to use. There are enemies that can only be damaged by melee so it pays to have one equipped. Likewise, there are lots of types. Swords that slash near it in an arc, a spear that shoots in front with greater range and hits enemies on coming back but doesn't hit above or below you, a blade that simply circles your ship, a chainsaw and so on. They are really cool and fun to use.\n\nLast is shields, which are fairly simple; they block attacks. They are likewise varied in how they are used, some reflecting shots but having less strength, some a wider area, some spiky so they do damage if you hit with them. They can be real life savers on certain bullety bosses.\n\nThere are a couple annoyances in the platforming part with how...odd your character moves and sometimes the screen can get so cluttered it's hard to see shots coming for you (and your hitbox is...indeterminate most of the time) but honestly any bad parts to this game are easily washed away by how fun it is to get right into the swing of things and how quick the levels play out. Getting a perfect on each level sure is a pain in the ♥♥♥ in a fun way.\n\nAnd that's pretty much it. You're a little squiggly doodle who comes out of the Idea Spring and is immediately conscripted into the war against the Logiticians or whatever they're called which are trying to oppress you with their straight lines and harsh angles. You just gotta be free and squiggly!\n\nThe game is cheap and mad fun.

As the game describes, the world is entirely drawn with ballpoint. The environments are done with great detail and patterns, and the background colors are just a level of high on its own. The sprites can become repetitive but that point can be ignored altogether.\n\nGame is pretty straight forward, if you guys are fans of R-Type shooters, this one is neat-o. (With short Mario platforming breaks in the middle of shoot 'em up waves) Ship customization, while not so deep, is interesting enough to work on. Controls can be a bit of an issue but the game does support several options - you can switch between Keyboard, Mouse, and Gamepad on the fly.\n\nSoundtrack compliments the art style sufficiently - it's sci-fi but fits the doodle world with mixes of heavy overlays to chirpy switch ups.\n\nThere is low involvement when it comes to a story but we are taking a break from all the deep plots at the moment. You basically are a doodle in a doodle world, with doodle ships in a doodle war.\n\nMy only real gripe about it is the achievement system not unlocking properly at the moment. Whether it's my own internet connection that's the problem or something on the game's end, I can't really say right now.\n\nOverall I do recommend getting this game, as a leisurely break from all the complicated titles out there.

I'd say about 90% of your time is spent playing the main course of the game, the side-scrolling shmup portions. The difficulty level is surprisingly not punishing, which is very different from the shmups I'm used to where you have to practice until perfect to make any progress. Ballpoint Universe takes a more forgiving approach by allowing you to gain points for levels via fallen enemies, you keep those even if you die and can upgrade offensive and defensive maneuvers. The variety and customization is quite nice though I find there are too many largely ineffectual types of bullet patterns/weapons. The keyboard controls aren't good, the mouse controls are much better. Gamepad seems like it would be ideal for this type of game. The levels themselves are pleasing, a variety of enemy types to learn, distinctive music to listen to, and often beautiful visuals. Typical for this genre but definitely no slouch here.\n\nAnother thing I really like is the other 10% of the game where you're in this side-scrolling adventure game portion. You can talk to other creatures, find collectibles on your journey, and have a bit of non-linear choice in stages. If you're doing poorly at a particular stage for example it's often possible to seek out alternate paths and come back later.\n\nTo bring up some complaints though, navigation during this phase is dreadful with the mouse configuration so I often switch to KB config and back to M again for battle phases. It's a hassle. Also, the graphics could be crisper and higher resolution. The paper-like textures are not as convincing on a larger display.\n\nTo sum it up, this is extremely good for the asking price.

I actually began playing it to get the Steam Trading Cards to sell on the market.  I didn't know what to expect since I hadn't even bothered watching the trailer before playing.\n\nWithin the first 5 mins the artsyle rubbed me the wrong way and I said to myself, "Well, I was right not to have high hopes coming into this."  After realising it wasn't just a platformer, but a side-scrolling shooter, I was taken aback.  I was also surpised at how addicting it was, wanting to grind for ink (currency) for my next gun or sword for my airship.  That 5 minutes turned into 1.5 hours with little regret :)\n\nThere are a nice variety of weapons to choose from for both weapon slots, a slot for special abilities/weapons, and another slot for defensive upgrades such as health.  Every single slot item can also be upgraded up to 3 times each.  During combat in your airship there are rewards given for acheiving bronze, silver, or gold rating dependign on how many lives you survive with from your airship mission.  When not in combat (during platforming) there are hidden "trophies" to collect throughout the game.  I'm not entirely sure of there purpose, but I'm sure it will be revealed soon enough.\n\nTL;DR this game has a unique artsyle that will probably grow on you if it hasn't yet, addictive gameplay with a multitude of fun weaponry and upgrades to purchase, and can be quite challenging.

The game itself feels very Jekyll and Hyde. On the one hand you have the shmup half of the gameplay that feels solid, albeit nothing spectacular. It starts to lose a lot of its challenge once you begin to upgrade your ship beyond your original parts, but I still had a fair amount of fun with it thanks largely to its highly detailed art design and a decent soundtrack.\n\nWhen you aren't playing through the shmup portion of the game, though, you'll be struggling with the platforming portion. I say without hyperbole that these are probably the worst platforming controls I've ever experienced in any game. Even the simplest of jumps can start to feel like monumental efforts. The end of the game in particular features some sequences that are far more difficult and frustrating than they have any right to be.\n\nIf Ballpoint Universe was just a shmup I'd have no problem recommending it. It's a basic shooter but the art style alone is worth experiencing. The platforming simply cannot be ignored, though. It's atrocious and nearly ruins the game. I'd probably give the game a "thumbs middle" if that were an option.","February 2, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The design of the characters and enviroments are creative and varied.  (The "Logicians" are less varied, but I suppose that's the point)\nThe story mode is short (It took me 3 hours to get gold on every level) and the plot itself is fairly simple.  Some levels can be hard to find and I found myself completly skipping one or two of them.  The story mode doesn't provide to great a challenge, but I still enjoyed replaying levels until I acheived gold.\nThe game's Infinite Mode is where all the replay value lies.  It provides a decent challenge. The difficulty ramps up each wave to the point of ridiculousness.\nOverall its an Ok game.  I'd give a 6/10.  It losses points for the platforming segments.

I actually began playing it to get the Steam Trading Cards to sell on the market.  I didn't know what to expect since I hadn't even bothered watching the trailer before playing.\n\nWithin the first 5 mins the artsyle rubbed me the wrong way and I said to myself, "Well, I was right not to have high hopes coming into this."  After realising it wasn't just a platformer, but a side-scrolling shooter, I was taken aback.  I was also surpised at how addicting it was, wanting to grind for ink (currency) for my next gun or sword for my airship.  That 5 minutes turned into 1.5 hours with little regret :)\n\nThere are a nice variety of weapons to choose from for both weapon slots, a slot for special abilities/weapons, and another slot for defensive upgrades such as health.  Every single slot item can also be upgraded up to 3 times each.  During combat in your airship there are rewards given for acheiving bronze, silver, or gold rating dependign on how many lives you survive with from your airship mission.  When not in combat (during platforming) there are hidden "trophies" to collect throughout the game.  I'm not entirely sure of there purpose, but I'm sure it will be revealed soon enough.\n\nTL;DR this game has a unique artsyle that will probably grow on you if it hasn't yet, addictive gameplay with a multitude of fun weaponry and upgrades to purchase, and can be quite challenging.

That said I still keep playing it as it is entertaining for several reasons and I've got lots of hours left still to spend on this game.\n\nThis game is great if your collection of games need a simple game for when you don't want to concentrate too much on a complex mission or boss fight. Don't get me wrong, Ballpoint Universe can be challenging too. But it is different from other indie games and though you might want to skip the dialog I advise against it as the little jokes about a universe made of doodles who fight logic and order are worth the time.","June 27, 2014","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/259390/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Ballpoint Universe - Infine is a small indie game with a beautiful artstyle, as you can see from any screenshot.\nIt has 2 components. First and foremost, it is a shoot 'em up game. Its story, however, is told through a 2D platformer, between the shooting sections.\n\nOverall, I think it fits the price, as a game. Despite being beautiful, its mechanics aren't too noteworthy (although not at all bad), and it has a few technical and design issues. On the other hand, it looks amazing, and it does a good job of entertaining you for a few hours.\n\nLet's start with its presentation.\nEverything in this game is hand-drawn. It has a very surreal style to it, even psychadelic, at times. But it fits the theme.\nThe texture work is impressive, with the weird patterns fitting all together, and the NPC and Boss design is also great! Everything seems out of this world and yet beautiful.\n\nThis is all well and good, but it has a few issues. First off, and this comes to the scale of this game, is the fact that some textures look low res, there are a few conflicts that lead to graphical bugs, and the fact that everything is a plane gives it a very fragile feel, at times. Just a little bit of depth (like cardboard) would have helped it.\n\nBut it still looks very good! And the issues are most likely because of its budget, so I don't want to be too harsh on it.\n\nAll that was regarding the platformer side. On the shoot 'em up side, the only issue I've had is the fact that the enemies explode into some very obstructive textures. This means that when you're surrounded by enemies, you'll often get killed by something that you literally can not see, and it's annoying, at times.\nBut that's my main issue with it. There's a very clear distiction between the background and foreground, and the levels look quite good.\nAnother minor thing is that the enemies have some parts of their body that do damage to you, and other that don't. Unfortunately, there's no visual distinction between these, which is a problem, specially with Boss Fights, whenever you need to get closer.\nAlso, despite the player having a small hitbox, it usually blends with the rest of the ship, making it very hard to do some tight dodges. Simply giving it a different color would have helped a lot. But hey, it didn't detract too much from the game.\n\n\nMusic and SoundEffects didn't really do much for the game, in my opinion. They weren't bad, but I think they should've gone one step further with it. They felt a bit generic, and did very little to enchance the very surreal sense of the art style, in my opinion.\nThere's also the lack of separate audio sliders. It's just lazy.\n\nBefore going over the gameplay itself, let's talk about the interface and controls.\nThe interface was pretty simple, but was surprisingly good. Whenever you paused the game, you would have a lot of info at hand right away, regarding missions, collectibles, changing the controls, going into infinite mode (more on that later), etc. Everything was a click away, so good job on that!\nThe controls, on the other hand, were a really big issue. This game has some of the weirdest control schemes I think I've seen in a while.\nYou have 3 options: Mouse, Keyboard, or Gamepad. The Gamepad felt like the Mouse, and made it even harder to navigate the menus.\nMouse and Keyboard were good and serviceable, on 2 separate parts. For the platforming sections, the mouse is almost impossible. Know how you pan out the screen in a RTS, or MOBA? Well, it's the same here. You drag the mouse to move the character, and click to jump/interact. It doesn't work. At all. It's so imprecise... I have no clue why this is here. It makes no sense. For this section, the keyboard is significantly better, although the character still bounces around a lot, and the platforming hitbox is dodgy. The moving platforms also interact very weirdly with the character, everything feels just... awkward and bad. And that's unfortunate. But, for the most part (not all), the developers were aware of this fact, and kept platforming to a minimum.\nFor the shmup part, the mouse works really well. Simple move it to move your ship, and click to shoot. Simple and effective. The keyboard however, doesn't work very well. Because of this, you'll be constantly switching between control schemes... And this issue hasn't been fixed at all, so beware.\n\n\nAlright, gameplay then!\nThere's not much to be said regarding the platforming. It's mostly just a vehicle for the story, and to show you how beautiful their art is. There are Golden Sketches scattered around the world that you may want to collect (for compeltionist's sake), but other than that, you're there to look around, and talk to the different characters, learning more about the world and its people. The story was pretty straightforward and wacky, but in a good way.\nFor the most part, there's barely any platforming, unless you're looking for the sketches. To reach some, there's some more precise platforming. And that way is okay. It still feels really bad, but it's not in the way. Unfortunately, in the later sections of the game, there is some more obligatory platforming. And it shows how bad it is! There are some bad physics interactions, you'll get stuck several times, etc, etc. It's bad. And I don't know why they decided to go back with their design choice and put platforming into it! It only hurts the game.\n\nThe shooting is far more interesting. You have an infinite mode (with 60 balanced waves, after that is just madness), and you have the story missions.\nIt did not enjoy the infinite mode. The story missions were pretty fun, though.\nBy completing missions and destroying enemies, you'll collect Ink. You'll use this to buy more parts for your ship, and also upgrade them. This is shared between the 2 modes. The missions rewards you for your performance (perfection will also get you a Golden Sketch). And these are the best way of getting said Ink. The missions are far more rewarding, and let you experiment quite a lot with the parts.\n\nThe infinite mode, however, doesn't reward you with much, so you're just playing the same thing over and over. (You can spend a special coin to start out from the place you died, and you get these by defeating bosses, so you'll progress quite quickly, which avoids repetition)\nThe missions, on the other hand, feel far more different from one another, both visually, and gameplay-wise. Some are just defeating waves of enemies, while others have environmental hazards that require timing to avoid. I really enjoyed completing the missions and getting all the rewards.\n\nYou have 2 weapon slots, a body, and a special move. There are melee, ranged, and also shields, as weapons. The body provides more health, and one of 4 different effects. The special move is like a finisher.\nThe melee is far riskier, but also deals heavy damage, and destroyes shield. This was my favourite playstyle, and it felt different from most shmups because of it! Some blades did forward damage, some damage all around the ship, wide arcs, etc. There's good variety here! And the same with the guns. Unfortunately, the game doesn't get to show you everything before feeling very grindy and unrewarding, which is a huge issue for me.\nWhile doing the story, it's great! You'll try out 3-4 combinations. After that, however, the ink payment is very low, and you're not pushed into trying out the different weapons, which would have been the joy of discovery in this game! Well, but it isn't. And that's very unfortunate.\n\nEnemy and Boss variety is really great as well. Lots of different bullet patterns, some will try to melee you... more variety than I expected!\n\nOverall, give it a go! It has lots of issues, but its incredible visuals are worth the price tag. It's a great example of a small indie idea enhanced a bit to make it a full game!\n","July 13, 2014","true","6.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

What at a glance I had thought to be an artistic platformer (as so many indie games these days are), turned out to be an artistic platformer/upgradable shooter. Although I was a little put-off from getting the wrong idea of the game, I continued to play and started to really enjoy it! Ballpoint Universe allows the player to use keyboard, mouse, or a gamepad at their will, allowing a wide variety of choices. The game has a surprisingly interesting story, and provides much inspiration with it's monochromatic artwork and interesting design.\nBallpoint Universe is a must-have for casual and artistic gamers alike, for it provides a fun and inspirational casual game for all to enjoy.","July 13, 2014","true","6.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/recommended/259390/","Soupinator","Soüp®: Legendary Edition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/","1293 products in account","Ballpoint Universe is a very unique game taking after scrolling shooter games like Raiden.  The game's graphics are almost entirely hand-drawn with, like the name says, a ballpoint pen.  This gives the game a very unique look and the lore of the game is designed around that as well.  I greatly enjoyed this aspect of the game, though I think the story could have been fleshed out better.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty standard sidescrolling shooter fare but features an upgradable ship with a good variety of weapons and hull upgrades that provide different bonuses.  It even features melee weapons which are extremely powerful but obviously dangerous to use and shields to protect your ship.  I haven't played a similar game with permanent upgrades or melee weapons and it's a nice change of pace.\n\nThe game is pretty easy with enemies not posing much of a challenge if you have decent upgrades on your ship.  There is a lot of enemy variety however and they are all very creative, being very different from what I've seen in other games.  It makes the game much more enjoyable than a standard side-scrolling shooter with equivalent difficulty.\n\nMy main criticism of the game is the overworld.  Outside of the ship missions the game plays like a 2D platformer with the player exploring the game world to find information about the story and new missions.  Unfortunately the platforming controls don't work particularly well, especially jumping which completely kills your momentum with even a small bump against an object and makes climbing stairs much more difficult than it should be.  The areas are quite large and can be confusing to navigate, especially since there is no map function than I have been able to find.  Near the end of the game you need to jump across moving platforms which makes the poor controls even more of an issue.\n\nThis is only a small mark on the game however.  The platforming is only required to play through the story and endless mode is available from the start.  The rest of the game is very enjoyable and if you're the type of person who wants greater difficulty, endless mode increases difficulty as you progress through the waves, moving towards a full fledged bullet hell game later on.","February 19, 2014","true","4.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The art style, obviously, is the most notable and unique aspect of the game.  It's consistently good (and weird) throughout the game and, along with the music, adds a ton of atmosphere.  The "ideas vs logicians" story fits in perfectly.  There are a wide variety of upgrades to acquire for your ship, including some genuinely useful melee weapons.\n\nHere's the biggest issue: the controls.  Do not expect precise movement like most shooters.  The platforming segments are better with the keyboard, or maybe controller, but the movement and physics feel wonky no matter what.  It's doable, but prepare for some frustration.\n\nThe flying missions should be played with the mouse.  It's highly unusual, but because the ship moves as fast as you can move the cursor, it seems as though the game was meant to be played like this.  That advantage will be required on the harder missions.\n\nControl schemes must be switched manually by going into the menu, unless there's a shortcut I missed.\n\nControl issues are often a death sentence for this kind of game, but once I stopped resisting the mouse, and bought some better equipment, the good started to outweigh the bad.  The developers appear to have been confident about going their own way here, and the result is a game that's fresh and worthwhile.

The gameplay is a mix of 2D adventure platforming and a shoot-em-up.\n\nThe controls are a bit difficult at first and I found myself switching from mouse to keyboard controls for precise maneuvering, but there's no way I could control the ship for the shoot-em-up portions with the keyboard; that really requires the mouse.\n\nI also found the selection of weapons for your ship to be really mind-boggling, in a good way. The melee elements are unique and a refreshing change.\n\nThere are some minor glitches and I'd love to know if the developer is working on improvements and/or additional levels (or a whole new title!).\n\nOverall, for the price, this game can't be beat.

From the odd mix of 80% shootemup and 20% adventure platforming, the beermat doodles brought to live in a beermat doodle world, the awkward controls that you need to get used to and the odd but cutely presented story and characters that come with it.\n\nI didn't like it first time around, but at a second glance I suddenly got into it and I really enjoyed the game as a whole. It's not too hard or easy, the weapon and ship upgrades are numerous and feel pretty unique (by design anyway). It's fun to see the uses for each item -even the crappy ones- and just start collecting everything while finishing the rather short storyline. Plenty of replayability if you want to get each and every achievement, as long as you don't mind some repetitiveness. I think the story mode could have done with one or two more worlds though, but it's enough for its price (and budget, I presume).\n\nSo yeah, it's worth the 4 euros that it's currently at, but you can also wait for a discount if you're in doubt.

"Intriguing", you may say, much as I did. Well unfortunately, that is where the pros end and the cons begins because Ballpoint Universe is a complete and utter mess beyond those two qualities.\n\nLet's start with the default button mapping: frankly, it's a joke. There are three control schemes available and not a one of them is configured in such a way to mirror the standardized control schemes of any certified staples in either the platforming or shoot'em up genres. Sure, you can remap them (only through the launch menu like other Unity-based titles, though), but it begs the question: have the developers played anything other than their own work? Well, let this be a foreshadowing for what's to come.\n\nThe side scrolling segments more or less make for a glorified map screen; you can talk to various characters, acquire some of the golden sketches and locate available shooting stages to play. To navigate through the game world with the mouse or a gamepad is practically unfeasible, though a logically configured keyboard is at least serviceable and other than the jerky movement of our protagonist, there's not much to complain about here. Sure, the puzzle solving is mindless, but it is functional.\n\nWhere I really lose my patience is when the game switches to a shoot' em up. Movement with the keyboard causes your ship to fly all over the screen at the slightest tap making it a worthless input method. Only here does the mouse shine, but Tyrian this isn't; Ballpoint Universe is bottom of the barrel, indie shoot 'em up garbage. There appear to be a number of optional pieces for building your ship, though as of six lengthy stages in, I have yet to find anything other than the freebies given at the start. The defaults can each be upgraded by three levels by spending ink, the game's currency, though this does little to improve their viability. On the positive, the trash mobs have little variety and never move with more than one pattern making upgrades pointless, anyway. On the down side, this makes for an incredibly dull, uneventful outing, causing the player to die almost exclusively from a monotonous lack of engaging stimulation as opposed to genuine challenge. Disorientation caused by both the screen shake effect and nauseating parallax scrolling (particularly on 'Brethren') don't help out much, either.\n\nHonestly, this is one of the most baffling games I've played and for all the wrong reasons. It's as if Arachnid Games have deliberately created something that completely misses the point as to why anyone would play a platformer or shoot 'em up in the first place... broken controls, dreadful gameplay and an intellectually insulting waste of immaculate hand-drawn art all make Ballpoint Universe of the worst games I've ever had the misfortune of adding to my Steam library, case closed.","August 10, 2014","false","2.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

Based on the trailer, it kind of seems like it's equally divided between platformer and shmup gameplay, but it's not.  Since I'm not really a big shmup fan, this was a bit of a letdown.\n\nAdditionally, the platformer sections are really weakly executed.  The controls are clunky, and it's kind of a confusing, aimless experience.  You're thrown into it without any sense of direction or purpose. I liked the concept of switching between gameplay styles, but exploring felt like a chore (and I have a strong preference for platformer-style play).\n\nIn the shoot 'em up sections, I felt like the melee weapons were absurdly stronger than the shooting weapons... and working up to getting upgrades felt repetitive and not very rewarding.

Based on the trailer, it kind of seems like it's equally divided between platformer and shmup gameplay, but it's not.  Since I'm not really a big shmup fan, this was a bit of a letdown.\n\nAdditionally, the platformer sections are really weakly executed.  The controls are clunky, and it's kind of a confusing, aimless experience.  You're thrown into it without any sense of direction or purpose. I liked the concept of switching between gameplay styles, but exploring felt like a chore (and I have a strong preference for platformer-style play).\n\nIn the shoot 'em up sections, I felt like the melee weapons were absurdly stronger than the shooting weapons... and working up to getting upgrades felt repetitive and not very rewarding.  Admittedly though, I didn't play very long, so I didn't explore many of the customization options, which seem to be one of the strengths of the game.\n\ntl;dr- The art is as nice as advertised, but the gameplay felt too clunky and drawn out (haha) to be enjoyable for me.

I normally hate shmups.  Make of that what you will.\n\nIt can set a bad first impression, though, since it also has platforming sections with wonky physics.  Fortunately, you can change your control method in the pause menu, so you don't have to move with the mouse during these parts.\n\nPlatforming is certainly the weakest point, but thankfully not the main one.  The shooter levels are much better.  There is mouse control, which is basically vital to this genre IMO, and it follows the bullet hell formula, so there's plenty of precise dodging.  Most bosses are comprised of several parts, and it's satisfying to break them down piece by piece.  You get five lives per stage with extra rewards for finishing with more remaining, so it's not super punishing but still rewards you for doing well.\n\nThere's a good selection of weapons, including strong melee weapons to reward high risk strategies and shields to absorb and reflect oncoming bullets.  You buy and upgrade items with ink from defeated enemies.  Each purchase contributes toward unlocking satellite allies, so upgrades to weaker items are not wasted.\n\nThe ballpoint pen artstyle is nice to look at without being too busy.  I felt like I had a clear view of what to avoid.  The music is also pleasant and the sound effects offer a decent sense of feedback.\n\nI'd say this game is worth a try.  Just don't let the platforming segments put you off and it should prove to be enjoyable overall.","November 4, 2014","true","18.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The fact that there is health, but I die instantly to direct ship collision rather than bullets is partly because of the melee weapon being the best especially early on and many times becomes the only option offensively.\n\nEssentially the player is given great incentive to get close to spazzing enemies that kill on touch. Bullets are easy enough to dodge thanks to the speed, but I often overshoot and die due to the problem mentioned earlier. Upgrading the gatling guns makes it mildly more tolerable, but is still kind of weak when upgraded. These are just the starter weapons, but I've no patience to hunt for them blindly.\n\nThe pacifistic platforming sections are even a bit annoying in that any wall you jump into will bounce you away leaving you to make the jump again. Anything even moderately high and I have to back up to make the jump. This is a huge pain as is if I didn't have to deal with the mouse acceleration controlling the characters run speed. Worse, I have no clue in this sea of recurring characters demanding mission requests which one will give me one of those new weapons! The dialogue isn't even witty. It's just super annoying with the only upside being that you are looking at some moderately good line art. Even then I feel it's an excuse the lack of cohesion.\n\nSloppy controls, poorly balanced offensive options, bland house music, but at least there are notably unique visuals. This game is a huge disappointment to me as a fan of the genre. Maybe get it to dazzle a petty kid, but anyone looking for a decent shmup, whether casual or hardcore, look elsewhere. I cannot recommend this confetti covered flawed game, however I can recommend at least Jamestown or Binding of Isaac: Rebirth as alternatives on Steam.","November 26, 2014","false","1.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OperationalOperator/recommended/259390/","OperationalOperator","Ridah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OperationalOperator/","519 products in account","Glitchy, Frustratingly broken, and just not a good game in general.\n\nI have had countless 3 or so times where saves mysteriously deleted themselves or reset or where just the game glitches. I can't explain the frustration. Theres a bunch of glitches in the game, one being that the homing rockets  will home at things not on the screen and will continue doing this for entire missions/levels. To fix this you have to update to the beta version. Doing this literally Effs your saves up. I have no understanding why this game has so much impetus to screw your saves up or why the programmer has decided saves arn't sacred.\n\nControls arn't particularly good. They feel wish washy and innacurate regardless of sensitivity so its easy to go to far or not far enough and ram into a wall. What I ended up doing is just slamming my stick up and down and flying through bullets trying to get lucky and not get hit because I feel theres a better chance of that then accurately missing the bullets.\n\nSounds pretty decent. Nothing to really comment on.\n\nBut now for the actual game part. The design sucks ♥♥♥. Most of the weapons are either overtly expensive or just suck. Do you really want a gun that dousn't shoot where your aiming? Or a blade that only hacks at enemies right in front of you, or a shield that only blocks when not firing and takes up a weapon slot? There just dousn't seem to be much thought put into making it fun so much as just designing a game in theory that would be fun. Bosses/enemies are reused in the earlier levels and later ones and some enemies are simply annoying. There are a few enemies that will try and ram you to kill you, which after 1 enemy type is enough. Some enemies will have seeming constraints tied to the player and they move to mirror the player which is just annoying and frustrating when you have a screen of stuff going on or just them alone. Atleast in the fashion they mirror you.\n\nWhen playing most of the scenarios just arn't very fun, situations get reused. Onions falling from the sky happens way to often and some levels are hard to tell apart.\n\nI say ♥♥♥♥ everything and get the revolver first and then play the lottery or just cheat to get the homing missiles. Without them your essentially fighting with pea shooters and then you can play as you want from then on.\n\nGraphics is probably the main selling point of the game and I don't like them. They don't look especially crisp when playing and are somewhat blurry to my eyes. Nothing really pops and just ends up looking a bit weird and to a degree it all kinda blurs together.\n\nSuffice to say I didn't get to beat this. After the game keeps eating saves you just say ♥♥♥♥ it, this is to be expected with indie games of questionable sources.\n\nIts just not a very good game, it could have really used some testing and some more development time put into it as you can really see the possibility of a good game, but possibilities don't make for good games on there own. I really tried to give this game a try, but when you spend 7+ hours and saves keep dissappearing you say ♥♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t especially when the gameplay you can get from other...better games. I don't like grinding to get better gear in any game because its ♥♥♥♥ing stupid.\n\nSuffice to say Im angry and frustrated with this game and Im not sure if I will even try again to beat it. Its not a horrible but it sure ain't what most would call a good game. Better than some, worse than some others.","July 17, 2014","false","7.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vazcarlo/recommended/259390/","vazcarlo","GC Positive","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vazcarlo/","570 products in account","Made by Arachnid Games, Ballpoint Universe is a mix between platformer and shoot-em up set in a world hand drawn in entirely, you guessed it, ballpoint pen that is inhabited by Doodles, and their rigid counterparts Logicians. You, a small little Doodle, must get in your ship and stop the Logicians from converting everything into logical rigid, and more efficient forms like squares, triangles, weird skeleton heads and...half faces that shoot teeth at you...Yeah! From start to finish the art is decidely...okay. NPCs models are often reused almost to a repetitive degree, and don't really stand out. The doodles for the most part can be categorized as one of these: Bald hitchhiker, zombie tv, boot soldier, or potted plant that has lost its pot. Backgrounds and environments are hit or miss. Sometimes they're interesting and warrant exploration, but that feeling quickly wanes as you'll be going back to some of these places as the story progresses. The art during the shoot em up sections tends to follow this trend with the added nuisance of having scenery in the foreground that blocks your view of the action. The platforming is basic stuff the whole game through. Jump up stairs, jump on moving platforms. That's basically it. The controls aren't very good; Doodle slips and slides across the ground, and you will quickly discover that the real challenge during these sections is mastering the floaty gameplay. Seriously, you have no traction. If you're on a slope, poor Doodle tumbles and fumbles to his death assuming nothing catches him mid-roll. Upon landing, he'll slide a little bit more past your landing point and often times roll right off the platform, and in multiple cases jumps so fast that he ricochets off the wall of a ledge and falls (and then subsequently) rolls off the same place you jumped from. No matter how tall the ledge in question is. In one instance, I had to purposefully miss a jump, allow Doodle to roll himself into a corner, and then jump only to land on my mark and roll off of it until I realized that since I was in a corner and would ricochet off the ledge next to me the air-time would be enough to send Doodle past half of the jumping puzzle. While the platforming bits are probably the most difficult parts of the game, they do not take up most of the time you'll playing it. Each platforming section is broken up by missions given to you by certain npcs you encounter as you progress. During each mission, you blast and slash your way through enemies, fight a boss, and then collect medals based on how well you performed. Killing an enemy unit during missions drop Ink that you can collect to upgrade your ship. Considering this is a world consisting of Ink, I like to think the your ship grows stronger and runs on the blood of your enemies. The shoot em up gameplay is admittedly solid. Your ship is made of four parts: Two weapon slots, a nose, and the wings. Each part can be changed and upgraded extensively, and each part also provides different upgrades to the ship as a whole. Guns have different firing patterns, the nose of your ship determines what kind of special blast it has equipped, wings provide support bonuses and health, and melee weapons have varying ranges for attacking. There is room for creativity. You can mix and match parts any way you want, so it's very possible to have a ship that looks very different from the one you start with. However despite this the shoot em up segments suffer from a few hiccups. The first most predominately being boss designs. With one or two exceptions...they suck. With such a small selection of missions to play, it's a little anti-climactic to be fighting the same boss I already defeated two missions ago. Especially if this time around it's the same boss fight. There's even one case where the missions are back to back and the boss is exactly the same. The second issue is the pacing of these levels. The missions feel slow and drag on, with enemies lethargically drifting around the screen, and half the time don't even shoot in your general direction. I should take the chance to note that the music, while being the game's strongest aspect, drives home the relaxed pace of these levels. Maybe it's just me, but when I hear this:\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/docprop/doc-prop-saddle?in=docprop/sets/ballpoint-universe-original\n\nat the ship select screen, I get excited, and then I get treated to this after hitting the GO button:\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/docprop/doc-prop-mad-ploppage-the?in=docprop/sets/ballpoint-universe-original\n\nAnd I feel like I've just been told to stop getting excited about blowing ♥♥♥♥ up. My personal peeve with the game is the way it punishes melee weapons. Don't get me wrong: An enemy moving around the screen to avoid me? That's fine. Enemies that form lines and fire barrages to prevent me from getting close? Fine. Enemies that kamikaze to kill me? That's all okay, but an enemy mirroring my movements and going off screen to where I can't hit them? Not good. It makes a slow shoot em up segment even slower, forcing me to hug the left side of the screen until they slowly saunter back into view so I can hit them once before they fly out of view again. That's boring, and especially annoying when a level boss does it.\nUltimately, it's not a great game, it's not even a good game. It's decent, and no amount of ballpoint pen drawings or ship customization can change the fact that it falls flat in both of its genres. Add to all that the very short campaign of about two to four hours, and it's safe to assume that while Ballpoint Universe looks good on paper it certainly doesn't make the cut. Feel free to skip it, and use your money toward something else. Buy steam cards or something I don't know.","December 20, 2013","false","3.1"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","0"

Ballpoint Universe: Infinite centers around you being a doodle and fighting a vague logic based enemy. You fight using a customizable ship that lets you purchase and upgrade 2 weapons (swords, shields or guns), a nosepiece that controls super attacks and a body that gives health and other bonuses. You fight the Logic enemy in a side scrolling shooter and at the end of each section fight a boss with various destructible parts. The enemies in these sections are varied and it is always fun to replay them for the perfect rank. The art style is unique creating a world from something as simple as paper sketches. The only complaint I have is the platforming which involves you only using the mouse. This is only emphasized in 2-3 sections and all are near the middle or end of the game so it is not a deal breaker. However it does feel lazy that they couldn’t give alternate controls for these sections because these 2D sections are how you navigate the world outside of missions. You can also collect golden stickers in this section which may or may not do something if you get them all.

I really enjoy the dual-weapon upgrade system, though the lack of a practice mode makes choosing what to purchase *extremely* tricky--and I guess that sums up the game more than anything else.","February 13, 2014","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If this is a game you're debating whether its worth it or not, make no mistake, this is a genuine gem from a time when Kickstarter was still fresh and exciting.

No configuration is wrong, either, and while its easy to set yourself into a single set of stuff to upgrade further, variety is often key to get by certain tricky areas and enemies.\n\nI could ramble on, but all this nostalgic speak makes me want to dive back in for a trip through memory lane. If this is a game you're debating whether its worth it or not, make no mistake, this is a genuine gem from a time when Kickstarter was still fresh and exciting. Just do yourself a favor and play it with a gamepad. Platforming with a mouse is the weirdest experience you can imagine.","November 2, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The platforming parts feel a bit neglected and kind of get in the way of the better shoot 'em up parts which is the main gameplay. There are a lot of costumization options for your ship, most noticeable is the large choice of weapons. You can have 2 weapons at the same time, there are a lot of guns with varying attack speeds and damages, there are swords with different sizes and some sort of whips with different ranges. Enemies drop ink which you can then use to get more upgrades for your ship. Game is about 3 hours long.","November 3, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As far as doodles may be creative they won't make you stop to take screenshots.\n\nThe soundtrack is.. not that pleasant. Made me feel uneasy instead of relaxed or whatever it was supposed to induce.\n\nI personally disliked the main chracter that you impersonate and didn't feel like playing him, this is a shame. I think a good addition would be to allow the player to choose his character from a variety of doodles.\n","November 21, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Artwork is great, music fits perfectly; it works especially well when you transition to a battle-run. Tons of options for customizing your ship. And having the option for having a melee weapon attacehd the the ship is great. I wasnt crazy about it at first but the more I got around to using it the more I realized how helpful it is. The upgrading options are numerous and each option is also upgradable. So, you get a new weapon, try it out. If you hate it, now worries. Dont waste your cash (Ink) on making it stronger. Get something else and leave it alone.\n\nI do like the way the creator made the flat 2d worlds more 2.5D by being able to move into back and foregrounds across bridges. It was a nice touch to have that take place in front of you rather than having the screen fade to black or transition you. For those that dont own the game you must realize that youre on a quest in this hand-drawn world. And when you encounter other characters it gives you the option to hop into your ship and battle. Passing thru the turn-styles for game saves is nice and you never have to go too far or look too hard for them. However, I think this game wouldve worked a little better with a manual save option or an auto-save every time you leave a battle. Its  anice artistic touch but this game already has plenty of wonderful artistic touches. There is such a thing as too much of a good thing.\n\n","February 17","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Leider haben die entwickler vergessen, dass es nicht ausreicht, "Kunst" zu machen, sondern das es da auch spieler gibt, die das Spiel auch spielen wollen. Da ist das erste große Minnus, daß nicht erklärt wird, weder wie Gsmepad oder Tasten belegt sind. Auch wird man in einer undurchsichtigen Geschichte völlig allein gelassen. Aber was soll es? Schließlich machen die Entwickler in Kunst, nicht wahr ?  Da möchte man dann sicherlich auch gerne in ein Museum für "Modern Art" , was im übrigen auch der einzige Platz ist, wo ich mir dieses Spiel vorstellen kann. Ich aber bin diese halbgaren, nur halb gedachten und schludrig programmierten spiele wirklich leid und werde dieses spiel auch aus meiner Bibliothek entfernen lassen.","May 17","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Adding little dots as weapon fire making them fight in an imaginary combat, most of the time resulting in a page full of smudges as explosions happened and stuff were 'destroyed'! Well if you miss that, then Ballpoint Universe: Infinite is right on 'point' to satisfy all the doddle commanders out there!\n\nBallpoint Universe: Infinite is an arcade shooter with some platforming action and lots of upgrades to choose from! To my big surprise, misled by the 'infinite' of the title, the game has a lovely story that you will uncover step by step as you play. You are a newdrawn doodle exploring an 'almost' 2,5D world (there is the concept of depth and you will notice some models to be closer of further away from the camera in each level), in which you will find doddle npcs to talk to, missions to take, a lot of exploring and some platform jumping. At the beginning you may feel that you have no idea why you do what you do or what is your purpose, these are revealed later on the story. There are tons of collectibles to find called 'golden doddles', some hidden in plain sight, while others through fake walls, also acing a mission will grant you one golden doddle! The main game, the shooter part, happens during the numerous story missions or at the infinite mode. The infinite mode, as the name hints, you play till you die. You gain resources called 'ink' by destroying stuff and you can see all enemies and bosses appearing in this mode. Additionally missions award you ink depending on your performance and for any destroyed enemy, you can always repeat a mission to improve it or to get some ink by the defeated enemies of that mission. With the ink you can upgrade and improve your ship, so you do better at missions or infinite mode thus more ink and more upgrades! Your ship consist of 4 parts, 2 weapons, 1 wing or hull and 1 nose. There are many weapons, from melee blades and shields to shotguns and rockets, each with its very own design, effectiveness and fire mode! The wing affects your hitpoints and may add special abilities, like ink magnet, to your craft. Lastly the nose defines what your special ability will do and how many times you can use it in succession. Each and every part is upgradeable up to level 3, upgrading weapons and noses will increase the overall damage of that part, while wings add durability and special skill effectiveness.\n\nBy 'right on point', besides the obvious pun, I want to highlight that everything you will see in this game is drawn by hand in notebooks or blank pages. You 'll be able to see the blue and red lines of a notebook page in many places! The models besides the big variety, feel unique and magnificently well made, even in the tiniest details. From ship parts to bosses, combat backgrounds to the numerous levels you will wonder as part of the story, each feels magnificent and carefully made. Even the level design is superb as many of the golden doodles are surprisingly well hidden!\n\nThe game has 3 control options, either keyboard, mouse or controller. Each really easy to grasp and use effectively. Personally I favored the mouse for two reasons, one, I felt it was better during combat, and two, it felt challenging to do the platform jumping with it! However it is advisable to change between them until you find which suits you most. The music, while not something exceptional, feels just enough to highlight each phase of the game, either the platforming or the combat! The only negative for me, is that you can't touch the markings that were created in the back of the page after you finished that well made sketch/doodle! Definitely an unappreciated title as it is a reminder that game development can be an art!\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThis game was given to me by the steamified group.\nFor similar reviews and great giveaways feel free to visit http://www.steamified.com","May 31","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
