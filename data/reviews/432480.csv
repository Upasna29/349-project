The thing that it lacks the most is a bit more content, most of the game you are running around spamming your left-mouse button hoping that you kill someone. Another thing it lacks is players, you can rarely find people playing on the servers.\n\nCons\n*Nicely made 3rd person models.\n*Multiple weapon choices.\n*Clean UI.\n*Plenty of good maps to choose from.\n*Guy insulting you each time you die.\n\nCons\n*Lacks more content\n*Repetitive, all you do is just shoot at other people hoping you get a kill. Something like a Co-Op or a campaign mode would be a great addition.\n*Lacks active players.\n*Achievements, holy ♥♥♥♥, how the hell do you expect people to get 1000 kills?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/432480/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTouch Orchestra is a small indie game studio that is located in Brno, Czech Republic. Grenade Madness is their first game on Steam but they also developed Rail Heads for mobile devices.\n\nRather than a review – the game in its current stage has the potential to grow rapidly and very significantly through its development – I thought that some of my own personal observations would prove better.\n\nI tried to play the game on Wednesday. I logged into the game to find completely empty servers. I wondered if the game had bots you could play with when this was the case. Thankfully I found that the game could indeed be played with bots. Fifteen minutes later, which is a standard round, and the following screen shot was the result:\n\nlink to screenshot[images.akamai.steamusercontent.com]\n\nI am used to playing with that type of ping being from Australia. If we Aussies don’t have local servers then the ping is going to be 200-350 on a good connection so please ignore the ping result. What I am specifically asking you to look at here is the scoreboard particularly ‘kills.’ This is a standard result of games with bots. The results were similar when I started a game with just one other person. You only lose “kills” when you commit suicide (-1 to kills each time you commit suicide). Rounds are fifteen minutes long. The “best” bot in this round killed itself at minimum fifteen times. The other two were in the twenties for a total of 63 suicides in a 15 minute round. That equates to 4.2+ suicides by the computer AI every minute. It’s more than that really if you want to get into the mathematics. There were 129 total kills in my game. I had 14 total kills and I may have killed myself more than once by accident as well. That type of AI is just unacceptable in a game like this when there are only 4 players/bots on a map.\n\nWhen playing with just another player the bots are just as bad at killing themselves. The game turns into a bit of a farce as you are constantly chasing your real life opponent around the map and taking the cheap bot kills when they’re not too busy killing themselves. So how do they manage to kill themselves? In the most stupid way possible. There were multiple occasions where I would think that I was getting close to killing a bot and it would turn to face a wall, shoot a grenade on the wall directly in front of its face and literally stand there as it blew itself to smithereens. The game is called Grenade Madness and not Suicide Madness.\n\nUnfortunately when I returned to play the next morning the servers were once again empty. The devs were awesome enough to provide a bounty of keys so I ran a quick giveaway on the Steamified Steam group in order to get some community members to play the game with. What I discovered was that you really need three or four players to have a meaningful game. A single bot wont kill you but it’s a pretty cool game when you have a number of real people to play with. It’s an easy game to learn – if you’ve ever played any sort of shooter you’re going to be set before you start – so it makes rounds easy to get into and a lot of fun. If you have a group of competent players it’s going to be some of the best fun that you can have and even more so if they’re a group of friends. So as much as I’ve ♥♥♥♥♥ed about the shortcomings of the game there are a lot of strengths and the game is a ton of fun.  The action is fast and furious, the kills and suicides occur very quickly, and given the difference in weapons (knife, grenade and block placing launcher) there is room for quick thinking strategies to be employed.\n\nMy favorite part of the game play are the knife fights. Though grenades can be launched and that is fun there’s nothing quite like being in the midst of close combat where you knife your opponent to death. And if there’s another player in the distance who shoots a grenade into your area he can get a smart double kill. You can even use the block grenade to put an obstacle in the unsuspecting way of your opponent. Although I must note that one time that I tried this I got my opponent stuck in the wall. The assorted arrangement of power ups are also quite handy and well thought out.\n\nI didn’t investigate this myself but apparently you can change a number of the settings within the game. A member of the Steamified community established his own random room and changed the base settings of the game. At one point he, and the bots, were running around three to five times faster than what I was capable of. Therefore if you are to play on a random server I would be a little skeptical as to what the settings in that particular room are.\n\nI must note that I loved the voice overs. When you commit suicide, for example, the robotic computer voice over will say “What have you done?” which is quite funny and when somebody else kills you you’ll occasionally hear “Try harder” which made me laugh quite sadistically. It’s small touches such as these that really can aide the game to reach its potential. The graphics are suitable but you’ll be sure to notice that there are currently clipping issues within the game.\n\nI think that about does it but I’d like to close this by thanking the Steamified community for being as fantastically awesome as you are. Yes, some of you got a free game out of it but it was an enormous amount of fun playing the game with you. If you could write a review for yourself and post it on the game’s store page – positive and negative – I am certain that the devs at Touch Orchestra will really appreciate it. It’s a surefire way that they get the information that they require to make their game the best that it can possibly be for you.\n","May 2","true","1.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I feel that the game is clearly unfinished even with it being in Steam Early Access. To begin the game does not support borderless window mode which is my personal favorite because I multitask a lot. It also doesn’t have in depth video settings, it only have presets. You can’t change anything. You set a resolution and go with or without full screen which makes you restricted to customizing anything the way that you would like it. Sensitivitiy also felt sluggish to me and after going into mouse settings it said volume instead of sensitivitiy so I tried to tweak it a bit but I didn’t think that it actually changed anything.\n\nIn regards to gameplay, there was literally 0 players online but the game does support bots. I found it frustrating even on my own local custom server as it felt laggy. I had about 70-80+ ping most of the time and it felt like that. The game was often drawing me back and the AI felt really terrible. I have never seen anything like it in my gaming experience so far – bots wont attack you even if you facestab them with a knife. They just randomly shoot guns trying to commit suicide and the only way that you might get killed by them is to walk into their grenades of your own accord so for me there was literally no point playing the game for more than ten minutes.\n\nPROS:Concept – (the game is close-quarter based shooter with you either building your defense and making your own castle so that you can hide or going ham shooting grenades everywhere.)\n\nGraphics – (even though you can’t change anything and customize it the way that you would want the game itself has a beautiful and eye catching graphical style)\n\nFastbased shooter – (What I mean by that is that the game is not boring because the short-quartered maps so you can easily go on a rampage running around shooting everywhere and there is no chance of camping which I personally like.)\n\nBots – (even though the current AI doesn’t feel like they are enemies it is still good that the game supports them considering the low player base)\nCONS:Bots – (even though they’re implemented there’s a lot to work on, there is literally no resistance provided by them, they will not face towards you even if you are stabbing them in the face)\n\nPing – (this is probably the first game that I have encountered having a ping issue on a local server. I had a ping jumping around 70-90+ and it was really feeling laggy and sluggish and drawing me back.)\n\nThis review is part of the Steamified[www.steamified.com] Community Reviews.

You just connect to the servrer and play.. And the controls are simple so it's really this kind of instant fun. Some of the maps look unfinished but overall the graphics looks great (see all screenshots)\n\nThe crate gun really makes the game more fun so make sure you have it in your loadout!  Also I would love the opportunity to design custom maps or the character (the robot is not as beautiful as the environment). Anyway good luck with the development and the final release. I can't wait for it..","April 16","true","2.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"
