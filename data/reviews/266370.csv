Developer last contact on April 28 of 2016, Current playerbase is dead[steamcharts.com]. Although you can play with and against AI.\n\nThe game is fun, you drive a car (or control a turret) and your objective is to win by either driving or killing (as a turret) your racer's rivals. It remind me of Harms Way for the Xbox 360. However, as the Store Page says, it's in Alpha and is an unfinished product, there are few maps, to unlock some stuff you need to play a lot, and without an active playerbase it gets repetitive quickly, the driving controls need improvement, and most of the updates I remember, were new player models (cars). It still has some issues and with the way its being updated, I don't think it's worth the purchase right now.\n\nDo keep in mind it took them 2 years to apply an update that just changed the way turrets could get ammo and the removal of class progression barriers. The last update was on April 27 of 2016 but the in-game version still shows as the November 11 of 2014 one.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=681282398\n\n‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ | Disliked it","April 26, 2015","false","3.1"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","34","38","0","2"

The mixture of shooting and driving is really something cool, as I'm a racing fan, and i have friends that want to game but don't race.\n\nI do have one issue with it, in that there is absolutely no playerbase at the moment. We tested this to see if we could get ourselves up in the leaderboard and no points have shifted for any of the other teams in months.\n\nI haven't seen any updates for this game in a long time either. However, if the developers are still working on this and they are going to keep updating it and promoting it, it will be a great game. The idea is there, and I wouldn't stop anyone from purchasing it, but it is much better if you have a partner to be on your team.\n\nUPDATE:\nAfter months and months, there is still little playerbase and no new updates. I retract my previous review. While this game is fun to play, I feel that the developers have dropped this title and that is unfortunate.

This game supports controller and keyboard use at the same time, which i happen to like because i can aim better using a mouse in a turret and drive better using a controller. The game eniviroment looks pretty good and even has hazards such as rocks that can damage you. I would like to see weather effects though. One thing that sucks though is car respawn, when a car dies it will respawn in the middle of the track, which wouldnt be bad if it had a no clipping phase to it, but instead you can run right into them and wreck pretty bad.( i know you might say dodge, but i was right on his a$$ the whole game then he died and respawned in a second giving me no time to dodge.) As for sound effects the game is PAR if not sub-par with music and vehicles. still dont have much to say about sound quality. This game also allows single player racing against AI controlled cars, or alone where player can pick turret or car.","May 9, 2014","true","1.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I have quite a few "Alpha / Beta" Steam games so I am accustomed to unfinished games and would recomend this to anyone who liked racing or blowing s*** up.\n\nIf you can get the people then the game is great however it seems there is not much of a following at the moment seeing there is never anyone playing it seems.

It's like Trackmania with turrets, where a gunner and driver are paired together. Four drivers speed down the track included with the Alpha as they race to grab power-ups and avoid gunfire from turrets. The teammates can swap between any available turret locations on the map. Is a turret occupied by an opponent? Take it out and steal it from the enemy. Drivers can grab missile turret upgrades or debuff enemy turrets, as well as grab Nitro and Shield pickups. It's a fairly simplistic formula that keeps things balanced and straightforward. Unfortunately, I could only play against the AI so it's tough to tell how the whole game will pan out. If memory serves me correctly, the Live Arcade had a smiliar entry from the same team. From what I can tell, however, Alpha 1 has a bit of interesting content, a teaser, if you will. If they can iron out some of the loose car handling and reign in turret damage, this could be a fantastic title.","March 29, 2014","true","0.4"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Basically you and another person team up, one of you in turret and other in car and if you are in turret you try and kill enemy racers and if you are a racer you try and get past the other racers.

Nah.\n\nThe graphics are pretty sweet and the idea is conceptually awesome, and that's about everything good I have to say about the game. There's no real teamwork involved for a game that is 100% co-op (teams of 2v2v2v2) and it just feels really repetitive. I think the fact that there's noone to play with makes it like that, mincing up bots just gets old fast when there isn't a true "career" mode. There's just a couple unlocks whicht are fun to get and try, but then you're looking for something else and there is just nothing else there. I pretty much got bored before I even made it to a point in the game where the gunner gets to really play (re: mobile turrets, I'm pretty sure they're a thing, not sure if the feature has even been introduced yet).

Calibre 10 is an abandoned access title. The developers are entirely absent from the forums and haven't updated the game in any way for more than a year and half.\n\nThe idea was great--4 teams, two per team, one races while the other teammate controls turrets on the track and tries to destroy the other racers. This is the kind of game that relies on players being online, everyone stopped playing once the developers stopped updating the game. The game does have bot support but they aren't very smart, it's a bummer they didn't add local multiplayer.\n\nHost an empty online game and play with the bots for an hour or two and you'll have seen everything the game has to offer. Controller support is in race only, you can use the analog stick but it's just mapped to the keyboard arrow controls. When I look at what they had planned and how the game plays it would appear that the game is lacking 90% of the planned content.","September 25, 2015","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought this game on sale.  I had seen it ages ago and it looked good but I noticed the lack of updates so I did not buy it.  But for under ¬£4 I thought 'what the heck' and bought it anyway.  The problem with this game is the lack of updates and the fact it is not properly playable.  The devs need to get their act in order and finish this game because people have paid good money to support it.  I putting a 'no' recommendation for now, but if the game starts getting updates, I will change it to a 'yes'.","May 3","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
