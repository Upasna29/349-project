And while this game has been ported to Linux and Mac OS there is still a glaring problem with the multiplayer. There is no bloody cross-platform multiplayer allowed. That is, if one person with a Windows machine wants to play with a friend running a Linux Mint 17 machine, well tough ♥♥♥♥, they can't play together. The term cross-platform shouldn't even be used in these situations, each platform is the same in this case, they are all PC's. Seriously, it's just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized use of the word cross-platform which is usually asscociated with PC's and consoles not being able to play multiplayer games.\n\nSeriously Team17, get this crap fixed.

They're actually two totally different games) released in 2009 and while it's one of the older titles in the Worms franchise, it is definintely the one with the most features, gameplay modes, options, and overall fun out of the games I've played.\n\nUp to four teams each control a squad of four worms with customizable names, voices, and hats (in fact the Steam version has TF2-themed hats just for this occasion) and an arsenal of weapons ranging from rocket launchers, grenades, flamethrowers, and air strikes to ninja ropes, teleporters, and magnets to a variety of exploding wildlife and grandmas to the mighty meteorific field-wide death of Armageddon.  These worms will use said weapons to blow the living hell out of each other in a manner befitting old-school Looney Toons designed by Michael Bay.  Each worm only has a finite amount of time to make a move, inch across the battlefield, use whatever weapon or item they wish and end their turn.  A surprsing amount of things can get done during this time, but moves must be planned very carefully as just about any situation can be used against you somehow if your opponent is creative enough.\n\nThe controls on the weapons are all fairly simplistic but at the same time surprisingly complicated.  The physics engine is very in depth taking into account, angle, power put behind the shot or throw, wind power and direction, and the presence of any obstacles.  The precision in which things can be done is fairly impressive and a competent player can do things that might not even seem possible.  It is worthy to note while keyboard controls are present, a controller is generally recommended for this game due to how strange buttons are mapped originally, but this can be changed.  Gravity effects everything BUT the terrain you're standing on.  The randomly generated maps and backgrounds will stay put no matter how many pieces are blown apart until you're either sitting in a crater, traverssing tunnels, or recreating Bastion.  However, even a remaining pixel can be the difference between a hit or a miss in some cases so keeping track of what was destroyed how can sometimes work to your advantage but freak accidents can always happen.\n\nOne thing that's consistent throughout any worms game, especially in multiplayer, is that no matter how good one side is compared to the other, random chain reactions and other assorted problems can show up as a result of anything happening.  A grenade could be thrown and throw an enemy worm into a mine, which detonates a nearby gas canister that lights an area on fire that eats through the ground and frees up a hole for someone else to fall into- right onto a health crate that fell down previously.  But by no means is this a luck-based game.  Freak happenings aside, the mechanics, complex physics, and sheer creativity allowed in the vast arsenal of weapons and tools requires quick reflexes, careful planning, and a good knowledge of how the game works and mastering these can take quite a bit of practice.\n\nWhile this game is best played with friends, the single-player campaign is long and full of missions ranging from puzzles to challenges, to simply difficult missions and the AI at later levels is surprsingly advanced given how complex the rest of the game is.  Unfortunately, the campaign isn't really worth playing more than once as each mission has a special 'trick' to it that can render it fairly easy in the hands of a skilled player.  The actual multiplayer is where most of the action is.  Randomly generated landscapes of a variety of colors, themes and backgrounds from ancient Egypt to Hell to outer space never makes for the same game twice and customizable maps and game modes allow for more exacting factors to be controlled ahead of time should you wish it.  Due to the antics of how the game works, I recommend you play with actual friends either in person (It's worth noting that local multiplayer only needs a single controller) or online, but online multiplayer is also a perfectly viable option.  Fair warning to those who care, however: There is no word censor in this game and enemy team or word names you come across online can be inappropriate.\n\nOverall this is a fantastic multiplayer game that, if plugged into a large monitor, projector, or TV can make a fantastic couch party game that doesn't rely heavily on the RNG, but has just enough chance to allow laughs at a chain of explosions due to a misplaced land mine.  There's enough customization to keep games from getting boring or samey and custom teams are always fun to deal with and it's very easy to personify the little guys and give each of your team a distinct personality or strategy type in your head.  The single-player allows for a lot of time invested and makes for good practice and a rewarding experience by itself.  Still, only get this game if you plan on playing it with friends.","October 29, 2014","true","28.0"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","22","24","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheAnthonyNL/recommended/22600/","TheAnthonyNL","TheAnthonyNL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheAnthonyNL/","3345 products in account","Get ready folks, 2D Worms and back in action!\nTeam 17 presents: The Return of Worms in Worms ReloadedEver since the time the team switched from 2D to 3D, the Worms games had become mediocre. However, the developers have heard the fans voices - reverting back to the old school 2D classic we all know to love! After winning the game in a giveaway, I decided I'd review it right here for you guys!\n\nWhat is Worms ReloadedWorms is a 2D platform game which can be played alone or with friends online.The main attraction to the game is that you can blow your enemies to smithereens, destroying them in any way you want to, whether that be prod of kamikazes!\n\nIf you wish to know more about the specifics of this game, check them out on steam. As well as this, you can check out the official website here for more information on the entire Worms games series!\n\nCampaignIn the campaign mode, you'll compete in up to 35 single player missions, as well as having warzone missions to keep you entertained once those have been completed. As well as this, for those who have never played the game, there is quite an informative tutorial, giving you all the intel required to play and master Worms.\n\nAs well as this, you also have other game modes to experience. You could try your luck with the bodycount mode, which is basically a survival - beware, only the experienced player will beat this, you'll have to be amazing at the game to survive!\n\nAs for the campaign, it's not really all too difficult. Planning beforehand and strategizing your movements will allow you to easily defeat the campaign. Along with the side-missions, the single player will probably give you around 10 to 15 hours of solid, fun gameplay.\n\nGameplayThe gameplay is the same formula all the other games of the series has used, the movement is done via a simple input with the arrow keys, and jumping with the enter key. Shooting and aiming is done with the space bar and arrow keys (up and down), with different weapons being selected with your mouse.\n\nThe game is amazingly fun, the unpredictability of the enemy team and the amount of customizability with weapons and other factors make it amazingly fun, giving you the nostalgic feeling of being back in the early 00's playing the old-school Worms game we all know and love.\n\nThe acrobatic techniques such as backflips and other amazing stunts help you scale platforms otherwise not possible with a normal jump. With many platforms and different maps to consider (though they'll all destructible), the Worms game offers a unique experience like no other!\n\nNote; As for the controls, the game can also be played with a gamepad as well. It's absolutely great, works like a charm and is a lot less clumsy than the keyboard and mouse configuration.\n\nAfter playing the game extensively, I'll rate the gameplay 9/10. It's fun, very well polished and comes across as a great aspect of the game.\n\nMultiplayerThe multiplayer is really what makes the game what it is. Without it, it'd be a lot less fun and let's be honest, who wants to fire against the AI all day? New features to this great addition to the series include voice chat and the ability to invite steam friends when making a private match.\n\nMultiplayer provides two options when hosting matches, private or public games. Once your friend/enemy appears in your lobby, you can start warming up for the battle. There are some options above your name which details the value of worms you have and what color your team will be.\n\nBefore starting the game, the host is able to choose what level you are going to battle in. As well as the levels included in the game, user-created levels can be used, which is quite challenging and amazingly fun, especially if you have not played the map before.\n\nThe option for online chat is always there, in every game. Screaming down the microphone is always fun, and with the press of a button you can chat to all your fellow worms within any online game that you play on the servers. It's best to play with friends, but it's also great to take your aggression out on those strangers from around the world!\n\nUpon playing this game a lot via online and with a few friends, I'd rate the multiplayer portion of the game around 8/10. There are some flaws and the voice chat definitely needs some work, but other than that it's filled with epic, fun maps that will keep you entertained for many hours.\n\nNote: You can play with 2~4 players at once in a multiplayer match, as well as playing LAN if you have some friends over.\n\nGraphicsGraphics are amazing to see, there are a lot of new HD effects, all of which enhance the bomb explosions, jetpack animations etc. The developers have also added a nice little feature in the game, the worms scream when in danger.\n\nThere are also upgrades on the visual and aesthetic measures of the game, including new voices, new gravestones, as well as the addition of odd, funny hats for the worms, which is a welcomed addition to the game too.\n\nBecause of the vast improvements from the game's predecessors, I'll be rating this game a 9/10 for graphics. It's been vastly improved, giving the Worms games a whole new look and feel to it. Absolutely stunning visuals, especially for a game within this genre!\n\nExtra & SpecialsFor everyone who took a pre-order of this, you'll receive exclusive in-game items, as well as the DLC. If you play or have Team Fortess 2, you'll have been rewarded with some special items for that, too.\n\nAs well as this, Worms Reloaded has a in-game shop, where you can buy hats, landscapes, missions, weapons, gravestones and forts for your Worms.\n\nSince the Summer of 2011 there has been alot of DLC releases.\n\nConclusionThis game is worth buying, it brings back the old 2D Worms with a bang and a sense of nostalgia, which is always a good thing. Achievements have made a comeback too, which is always great to see in a game like this.\n\nI'd recommend this to all my friends over here! So hurry up and grab this game today! It's time to blast some worms out of the park!\n\nNOTE: Old review i wrote for a website.","March 9","true","8.9"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

At first I couldn't believe my eyes. How could've I missed this game? I decided to take a look what kind of game it was. Seeing only a single screenshot I knew I had to get this game. It reminded me of the simpler times. It reminded me about my old Pentium 2 PC that just barely ran Worms Armageddon.\n\nWorms Reloaded is a 2D-strategy game developed by Team 17. The game features a team based action-strategy experience where you have to eliminate the enemy team with wacky and fun wepaons. Those of you who are not familiar what makes Worms game differ from other strategic games is the way weapons, items and environment change the phase of the gameplay. You can use your weapons for dealing damage or blasting your way through dirt. Weapons can be used to modify your surrondings and tools can be used as deadly weapons. The way you use the gadgets you are given is the key to fun and challenging gameplay.\n\nThe game features different kind of game modes ranging from basic campaing missions to elimination game mode towards more challenging game modes like time trials and puzzles. There's a lot of thing to do and is definetly worth playing even as a single-player experience.\n\nEven though Worms Reloaded could be argued to be a modern Worms game it still feels right and controls like a classic 2D-Worms game. It even pays homage to older Worms games by including some older maps in the game. And that makes Worms Reloaded worth buying. It is well made. It is fresh. It is amazing.\n\nLastly, as a bit of a personal suggestion, I would suggest for you to get the DLCs. I usually never get them but seeing how many hours they add to the game (easily 50 hours) it is more than advised for you to get them if you enjoyed the base game.\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","March 14","true","13.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

I could not recommend it because there exists on Steam a better alternative: Worms Armageddon which is the game this one was trying to remake.\n\nThe term "reloaded" even reflects the dirty hollywoodian habit of rehashing stuff that was already good in the first place (and ultimately failing, remember The Matrix Reloaded?). The problem revolves around Team 17 trying too hard to be worthy of the cult phenomenon that was W.A and satisfying themselves with a paint job and a few additions that are not impressive enough to care about.\n\nGraphics sure are improved (although one might object, as I do, that the original sprites were better and that W.A was updated to work with HD resolutions giving a great feel to an "old" game) but maps and weapons are mostly imported straight back from the past (fan service has its limits) even outside of the retro pack DLC and worse: you can only get 4 worms team making rounds shorter and less strategic. Maybe the point was making the game more adapted to casual gamers, but then why make the game less fun in the same place?\n\nThen there are the ugly flaws: bad physics as illustrated by the behaviour of the ninja rope or the rebound of grenades (the original had the pride of pixel-perfect precision) and an AI level that can no more be adjusted or even shown on screen making some worms dumb as hell and others able to make humanly impossible shots ("cheating" by using perfect trajectory predictions). Some missions designed to be hard end up just being frustrating.\n\nThe developers should really move on instead of making the same game over and over and suffer the same fate as Activision. But if you really need a fun game that has great local and online multiplayer as well as a good solo campaign, look no further than Worms Armageddon, all praise the worm!","August 17, 2014","false","37.1"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","17","29","0","1"

New weapons, new graphics, more diverse campaign missions, and more customization (hats, victory dances, worm colour on top of added sound banks) definitely see the worms franchise moving forward.\n\nHowever, like I said, I'm a hardcore Worms Armageddon (1999) player and the gameplay mechanics (or the engine, I guess?) has been overhauled and it's just not the same for me. Also, teams can only have a max of 8 worms and the in depth scheme customization that I'm used to isn't present.\n\nIf you're new to the Worms series, I'd definitely recommend this game. However, I go back to the old Worms Armageddon to get my fix.

Mavka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kj-mavka/","587 products in account","I'm pretty sure most of us remember the Worms games from our childhood and that should be enough of a reason to re-start playing an oldie. Not only that it brings back memories from what feels like ages ago, but more importantly, it makes new ones aswell. Childhood memories are previous, regardless if they have been good or bad, they matter, and for that reason you should try the new and improved versions of those old games.\nIn my opinion, this game is the perfect evolution of the older Worms games, simply because it improved graphics and movement, but didn't go all the way to the 3D trend. I think 3D should be left for complex games of other genres, not this type. The best about this game is that the idea is simple and to the point, which is why Worms Reloaded is one of the most perfect editions.\nI think you should try it, especially that it's not that short and you won't get bored of it, not need to say goodbye to it too soon. You can play campaign mode, casual with friends or online matches with other people. There's also additional challenges and things like that.\nThe price is fair, and it has plenty of achievements that will keep you busy.\nAll in all, what more reasons do you need?

STOP READING THIS AND BUY IT NOW!!\n\nIf you have played a Worms game before, this is one is still a blast.  I played Worms Armegeddon when it came out, installed it on my high school's network harddrive so that every student who logged on could access it and play wonderfully silly local games.  And, boy, did we.  All the time.  And you could hear cursing and laughter throughout the computer lab (followed by everyone alt-tabbing or turning off the computer monitor when a teacher came over to question what we were doing).\n\nAlmost fifteen years later, Reloaded has been brought back all that hilarious joy that's definitely on par with Armageddon.  Local and online multiplayer is wonderful.  Lots of cursing and laughter with friends (we don't have to hide it from any teachers this time).  And really this is why you buy this game.  Hilarious, goofy weapons to blow up your friends and curse/laugh when you fail miserably and accidentally blast yourself to smithereens.\n\n\nWhat?  You're still reading?  All right, I can say more.\nGood things:\n-Steam Achievements: a ton of achievements that make you work (some are ridiculously hard).\n-Multiple platforms:  I play on Mac and Windows both.  It's nice to have an option.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: You cannot play across platforms online (I have to play on my Windows laptop when playing with friends since most of them don't have a Mac).\n-Map Editor is fun.\n\nSome Blah things:\n-The single player campaign is nice but it felt a bit short.  For a really great extended Solo experience, you'll want to buy the DLC or the Game of the Year Edition.  (GOTY includes all DLC and provides some excellent challenges.)\n-A LOT of Steam Achievements are linked to the DLC, so you'll have to purchase them separately or the GOTY Edition to get all of them.  BUT DLC only works for Windows.  So even when buying GOTY Edition, you can only play the base game on Mac and Linux.\n\nThe game is worth the money at full price, but it goes on sale pretty often, so I recommend keeping an eye open to snag the game for $5 or better.

The multiplayer is totally dead. I only see 1 game being played at any given time worldwide. This is sad. Reloaded was a genuine effort to blend Armageddon with modern sensibilities. It's still probably the best game for people with weaker systems but who want a solid update from Worms of old, without any drastic changes. I have a great system, and even the newer games like Clan Wars dont run perfect for me, like this game does. They really did a great job recreating the old sprites here. Unfortunately, without multiplayer, it's a weak experience. I gave up around mission 22 on the campaign, and none of the other solo content interests me.\n\nSuch a shame. At the time, I really felt like this was Team 17's comeback. But hey, if you want to stay hardcore, Armageddon still has players online.

After 2min you have  assemble your own team if you didn't like to take a preassembled one. The controls are quite the same as in all the old Worms versions. Click the right mouse button to choose your weapon, aim with the arrow keys, and then hold the spacebar as long as you need, to determine the right amount of power. All the old weapons, as Bazooka, Grenade, Baseball bat, donkey etc. and even some new ones are aviable to bring you the full mass of destruction on your screen.\nIf you liked one of the old 2D Worms game, I totallly recommend this game, and say this one is a "Must have".","September 24, 2014","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is an acceptable return to form after a series of mediocre follow-ups to the true gems of the series, Worms Armageddon and Worms World Party.\n\nHowever, unlike those gems, Reloaded lacks flair. The humorous, challenging missions of the past are gone, replaced almost solely by "just kill all the bad guys" objectives. Less emphasis is placed on skill, aim, and maneuvering, and more on easy weapons and utilities. The ninja rope, star item of the entire series, is virtually ignored for jet packs.\n\nIf you're desperate for a Worms game, this should fill the hole.

You are here to battle other Worms in this turn based 2D platform battlegrounds! You enoy some weapons, like rocket launcher, grenade, air strikes, bunker busters, and even armagedon! The game is best played on a large TV, using a controller, in your living room! And you can also play local multiplayer, because there is noone playing this online.\n\nAnyway, I'd say you will play this game for about 3-10h (varies if you do or do not play it the way I recommended).","November 4, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They are party games that perfectly mix skill and luck, and do it with such flair that even if you're coming dead last, you never really stop having fun with all the crazy weapons and situations that arise.\n\n\nWorms - Reloaded is I believe the "newest" iteration of this franchise, and I have to say that it isn't really the best... at least in terms of actually being a fun party game to play with friends.\n\nLets go back a decade or so to the playstation one, the good old PSX. Worms World Party had just been released, and it was the most fun I could ask for on a disk-based entertainment system. Sure, the previous iteration "Worms Armageddon" had a fantastic campaign, awesome music, HILARIOUS cutscenes, but as a party game it immediately loses out because A NEW GAME HAS NOTHING UNLOCKED! No weapons, no cool teams, nothing. Just the most basic weapons and voice packs. World Party has everything unlocked from the very beginning, and that made it perfect. He stuck that mother in at a party and went to town on each other's worms.\n\nThis is not a reason to hate on a game. Some people enjoy there being some challenge and unlockables to collect so you have a reason to play. Smash brothers brawl did this and was a huge hit... would the game have been better if everything was unlocked from the very beginning? Well... I think it would have, but it isn't my place to say.\n\nWorms reloaded is the exact same game you played ten years ago. It is exactly the same. Same graphics, same voice packs, same weapons (with a few new ones). We opened this game up to play at a LAN a few days ago, and were immediately disappointed to see that the concrete donkey, the holy hand grenade and the banana bomb were all disabled. Guitar hero learned after it's third iteration that players want everything available at the start, as gamers we no longer valued achievement over fun, we wanted to be able to put in a game and do everything that game allowed us to do. People still say guitar hero 3 was the apex before the series' downfall, thanks to it catering to the 'casuals' of the world. I disagree completely. Like it or not, casual gaming is here, and in many ways, it is better. Worms Reloaded is a brilliant casual party game, but it is nostalgia blind, catering to the completionists and achievement hunters of the world, which takes away from it, somewhat... but once again, that comes down to personal interpretation.\n\nI still reccommend this game, but if you're at a LAN and someone can emulate old playstation one games... World Party is still better.","October 5, 2014","true","6.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And, after actually learning Armageddon's controls and spending a lot of time with it, I have to agree.\n\nI used to think this one was a lot more solid, too, and was the definitive Worms game in my eyes. But after playing a lot of Armageddon, once again, that has changed.\n\nHowever, no one can argue that this one is a LOT more intuitive. You can use a gamepad if you want, and the keys are remappable for whatever method you're using. You aren't stuck having to look up the complicated and confusing controls of Armageddon on the internet (Though, they work pretty well once you know them. And they were actually quite easy to learn).\n\nThe fact is that if you want to get into Worms, or get your friends into worms, this is the best way to do it, bar none.\n\nAlso, Worms Reloaded is the best version of Worms 2: Armageddon. Don't settle for the less refined console releases. This game will run on whatever computer you have; you have no excuse.\n\n(Another thing to note, is that this game does have some features that Armageddon doesn't, though that works both ways; Armageddon has a lot of things Reloaded doesn't have either. If you enjoy this one, try Armageddon. And, you know.....vice-versa)","March 23, 2015","true","24.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Whenever I want to relax, have fun and enjoy a good few laughs dispatching foes without the pressure of real time vigilance demanded by first person shooters, Worms is most definitely where it's at.\n\nIf you're new to Worms, Reloaded is perhaps the best iteration through which to get acquainted with this loveable series. It's visually crisp and vibrant whilst being effortless to run for the majority of systems, with gameplay that is unwaveringly slick and reponsive; a refined culmination of all the earlier iterations that adhere to the classic 2-D visual format.\n\nThere's one prevalent trait of Worms games that makes them somewhat notorious - it's ever so easy to make a blunder, whether it's by virtue of throwing a grenade only to have it fall in the vicinity of an ally or even bounce right back at you; underestimating the amount of jetpack fuel required to reach your desired destination and then dropping like an ill-fated little stone; fumbling an ambitious attempt to ninja rope across a body of water and plopping straight into it - the list of both witnessed and hypothetical follies goes on, and this is a notable part of what makes Worms so pricelessly tide-turning and amusing although unsuitable for those excessively proud individuals who could never so much as poke fun at themselves!","February 19, 2013","true","64.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I find this to be an untenable situation, and for this reason the game is unplayable. There was apparently a third party solution at one point, but a patch has broken the mod. My recommendation.. nah. Team17 needs to get there act together.\n","June 29, 2014","false","0.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","1"

Well, the AI is either frustratingly intelligent, shooting with 100% accuracy, or incredibly dumb, blowing themselves up. There is no in between. The AI just isn't balanced. If you can look past that, it's pretty much the same as the previous 2D Worms games. There's definitely fun to be had here; the weapons are fun and easy to use. There is a lot of customization and randomization and the voices of the Worms are pretty hilarious.

Worms Reloaded features up to four player online and offline multi-player, voice support, a raft of crazy new weapons and the return of some iconic weapons from the brand’s celebrated past.\nWe all know and love Worms, Worms Reloaded brings all we love and gives it a new lick of paint. Its all here from holy hand grenades to exploding sheep and even the odd poke for good measure.\n\n\nStory:\nThere is no story per-say to worms, but it does feature a campaign mode that’s pretty comprehensive. Worms is simply about worms at war, there’s no rhyme or reason to it. But you will come to love your own group of worms. Worms has always oozed character and Reloaded is no different.\n\nGameplay:\nIf you have ever played Worms then nothing has changed, but if its not broken why fix it. Worms plays beautifully, even someone who hasn’t played before will soon be comfortable with the controls. In fact I put this to the test when reviewing it, we had a gaming night and after a few minutes my 8 year old had mastered the controls. For me that’s where Worms really shines, Its good to play on your own but even better with friends. There are very few games that span generations, but Worms achieves this as its loved by young and old alike.\n\nPresentation:\nThe graphics looked great ten years ago and nothing has really changed, its still those loveable little guys brandishing heavy artillery. It wont push your system even without a discreet graphics card, but its all well drawn and looks great.\nWorms isn’t about amazing graphics, its about fun. The presentation is great and you really will love these little guys but Crysis its not, nor does it want to be. The animation is smooth and its visually appealing.\n\nIf you want to read my full review and others visit http://cyberusuk.com","April 7, 2015","true","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a bit cut down from Armageddon but still runs nicely on lower-end systems, more than can be said for Revolution and onwards. The single-player is complete balls thanks to the AI (as it has more or less always been in Worms), but it's still a perfectly valid party game, and with the exception of the occasional hiccup, works pretty well online. There's no real reason to get any of the DLC except maybe Forts if you're really into that mode, just grab the base game on sale sometime.","May 12, 2014","true","23.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","2"

Reloaded has been recieved slightly above average compared to its older games. But thats all a bunch of lies, this game is probably one of the best games that got me thinking "which weapon should I use", "how will X weapon work when the wind is X", "theres a mine over here, and an explosive crate over there, if I can shoot just right, I'll be able to create a chain reaction". This game emphasizes strategy. You can't just go Rambo and shoot like a maniac. You have to slowly plan your attacks to win. (Also your a Worm who can easily get hurt and you have to take turns) To get the most out of this game, play with friends, especially on voice chat, laughs are guarenteed. Also if you like cosmetics like TF2, there KINDA in this game, TF2 gave Lumbrius Leads to people who bought it but IT EXPIRED so don't get ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Worms has alot of hats for your Worms to wear. (My favorite is the Scout hat on the Worms) Compared to Armagedon and World Party, this game is slightly under them, but the reason I own this one and not the older or newer ones is that the olders one, I have just not on Steam, and the newer ones got bad reviews.","March 24, 2014","true","67.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Theres no in-between. This game has gotten old, outdated and pretty much outlived itself even with the graphic improvements. Just the same I still love coming back to this game and still play it every once in the while. The biggest problem with this game is us human players with human reflexes can not master most of the weapons in this crazy game. Most of our aiming is go by our gut guess and feeling which is half of the time waaay off and even close isn't close enough 3/4th of the time. Now the computer is another story. Unless the shot is physically impossible to make you will see shots you you will will almost never make that are dead on. Forunatelly the computer does have an idiot mode but even in that if you fight multiple worm AI armies you will find the AI's of all the worms teaming up against you. This game shines best when you play it with friends and better yet friends vs AI worms. Are there better games out there? Yes but very few match the humor and cute ways to kill cute worms with weapons of mass destruction that have a habbit of back-firing on you a lot of the time. Is this game dated? Definitely but very few games of that time made it this far and Worms show why.","July 19, 2015","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also Steam Cloud saves!\nNice graphics that are definitely a step up from Armageddon's ageing '98 256-colour look. Now with cute dancing animations!\nUI is a bit clunky but much MUCH better than Armageddon's.\nEnhanced level generator capable of generating more types of levels.\nMany of the weapons have been streamlined and are easier to use.\nNew customisation options for pimping your teams.\nNew speech banks, while keeping some of the classic Armageddon banks. (it only gets feta!)\nIntegrated speech bank editor.\nCons:Only matchmaking, no WormNET/Servers. Online community is dead, go get Armageddon if this is what you want.\nNo LAN support...\nGenerally less weapons/items than Armageddon. (some of them I don't miss)\nDoesn't seem to be a way to make maps out of images.\nNo cross-platform multiplayer (can't play a game with a copy for a different OS), which doesn't affect me since all my friends use Windows.\nAI is even worse now. It either does something really stupid or it pulls off a shot with perfect accuracy, even on the lowest difficulty (tends to do more of the latter on higher difficulties).\nCustom speech banks are not synced by Steam Cloud.\nNot as much modding support as Armageddon.\nNo Whoopsie speech bank :C (I'll come back y'know!)\nSome of the content is locked behind DLC, which isn't the case with Armageddon.\nOverall, I recommend this game to newcomers to the series and people who just want to play with their friends. People who would rather join the Worms community will be better off purchasing Armageddon instead, so long as they can put up with its age.\n","July 8, 2015","true","56.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Reloaded has been recieved slightly above average compared to its older games. But thats all a bunch of lies, this game is probably one of the best games that got me thinking "which weapon should I use", "how will X weapon work when the wind is X", "theres a mine over here, and an explosive crate over there, if I can shoot just right, I'll be able to create a chain reaction". This game emphasizes strategy. You can't just go Rambo and shoot like a maniac. You have to slowly plan your attacks to win. (Also your a Worm who can easily get hurt and you have to take turns) To get the most out of this game, play with friends, especially on voice chat, laughs are guarenteed. Also if you like cosmetics like TF2, there KINDA in this game, TF2 gave Lumbrius Leads to people who bought it but IT EXPIRED so don't get ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Worms has alot of hats for your Worms to wear. (My favorite is the Scout hat on the Worms) Compared to Armagedon and World Party, this game is slightly under them, but the reason I own this one and not the older or newer ones is that the olders one, I have just not on Steam, and the newer ones got bad reviews.","March 24, 2014","true","67.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since this game is indeed fun (I've personally logged 200+ hrs into the game since getting it at release) and is a good reincarnation of the Worms series. Although, it does have its differences with the previous games. These are that you can only have up to four worms per team, as opposed to the traditional eight. Also, the maximum map size is smaller than WA and WWP (which explains the four worm limit, as Team17 thought it'd be a little too much to have eight worms a team with that map size)","September 27, 2011","true","248.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This ones an odd one. Worms has allways been a fav of mine. This game standing alone from the others is good in the sense that it has the customary augented graphics and UI and expanded arsenal. It also retains classic qualities like sudden death and the forts which gives it wallop too. In addition there are customization featues that are alot of fun like hats, forts, the ability to name worms (Which never gets old despite it well, being old) and the new and hilarious voice tweaks.\nFor me this is the best thing about this game, the best thing since in the very first version you could use paint to draw a new type of grave stone for your team. Leading to inevitable innuendo like phallic tombstones for example, and more sinister ones like a caricature of my own face. Anyway the goods on this late edition is the fact you can biuld your own sound bank of replies and comments to add to a team. This is a very tedious process I warn you, but ultimately immensely rewarding. I only managed it with online convertion software and an infernal production line of file management to get together an array of voices to fit the teams. And it took days, actual days! But by the nine was it worth it! However apart from this you won't see alot of useful new features and the game runs and feels like World Party did making it in my mind a 5 out of 10. But with its ability to add voices recorded of yourself or some other nutter to its characters this beast gets much wilder with a final mark of...\n6/10","November 29, 2013","true","61.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Worms is one of the mainstays of the 'artillery game' genres, alongside Scorched Earth and Gunbound. True to the nature of the genre, Worms has everything an artillery game needs: response and easy-to-use controls, a colorful atmosphere, a sense of humor, and weapons. Lots of weapons. Definitely a great little casual game, one where you can afford to sit down, play a couple of rounds, and laugh your ♥♥♥ off watching annelids carry bazookas, fire shotguns, and scream like little girl worms when a grenade lands right next to them. This game is by no means serious, and if you can handle a game which laughs at itself while they try to blow the crap out of you, pick this one up. Your worms are surprisingly cusomizable, and there is a game mode for everyone, from the crazy survival-mode Rambos to the challenge-map experts. Of course, not much else compares to blowing up friends, since games like these were born for multiplayer.

Problem is, this is a console port, and it shows. The UI is buggy and oversimplified, obviously designed for use with a control pad rather than mouse and keyboard. The controls in-game are just plain awful (no mouse aim... I need to say that twice: NO MOUSE AIM) and can't be re-bound (seriously?)\n\nA couple more minor complaints: firstly, the levels are too small. It's obviously going for the same size maps as W:A, but that was designed for older systems that didn't have the resources for huge battles; it's 2014 and I have 2GB of VRAM, let me have my 20-on-20 worm-war. Secondly, it's rather annoyingly DLC-heavy, and while the game is still fun without any of it, I wish it wouldn't promote itself quite so much. I've already bought your game, and I want to see it, not ads.\n\nOther than that, it's pretty fun, and it could still be fantastic, if the devs ever decide to get off their asses and patch it into a real PC version. But controls can make or break a game, and in this case, they broke it hard.","July 7, 2014","false","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gave up on the Puzzle DLC after four levels of tedium.\n\nThe AI in the single player is the worst offender. Even on the easiest difficulty, it seems that all enemy worms are capable of throwing a grenade through the most improbable gap and hitting you square in the face regardless of wind speed or obstacles, and it is ♥♥♥♥ING.

Reloaded has been recieved slightly above average compared to its older games. But thats all a bunch of lies, this game is probably one of the best games that got me thinking "which weapon should I use", "how will X weapon work when the wind is X", "theres a mine over here, and an explosive crate over there, if I can shoot just right, I'll be able to create a chain reaction". This game emphasizes strategy. You can't just go Rambo and shoot like a maniac. You have to slowly plan your attacks to win. (Also your a Worm who can easily get hurt and you have to take turns) To get the most out of this game, play with friends, especially on voice chat, laughs are guarenteed. Also if you like cosmetics like TF2, there KINDA in this game, TF2 gave Lumbrius Leads to people who bought it but IT EXPIRED so don't get ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Worms has alot of hats for your Worms to wear. (My favorite is the Scout hat on the Worms) Compared to Armagedon and World Party, this game is slightly under them, but the reason I own this one and not the older or newer ones is that the olders one, I have just not on Steam, and the newer ones got bad reviews.","March 24, 2014","true","67.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The premise is exactly the same, the weapons are exactly the same (save for a few new ones), the physics, humour, & the modes which people will be spending 90% of their time are exactly the same.

But there is no neat way of previewing maps (like there was in armaggedon) or simple way to quickly change match options (like there was in armaggedon).
