"http://steamcommunity.com/id/suspectfenster/recommended/219890/","suspectfenster","fenster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/suspectfenster/","150 products in account","Antichamber is easy to dismiss as a Portal clone at first glance; it is a first person puzzle game wherein you move from chamber to chamber, equipped with a puzzle “gun” which interacts with your environment.  But while Portal deals mostly in learning the rules of its mechanics and then adding complexity to those mechanics, Antichamber is a game which aims to subvert your expectations about how a puzzle should fundamentally work.  It makes you question the unspoken rules that video games abide by.  Frequently, it is simply brilliant and mind blowing, though occasionally it’s too obscure or random for its own good (especially in later parts of the game).\n\nThere’s no real story to speak of in Antichamber, but the entire experience is expertly accented in a very sterile atmosphere and minimal graphics.  Sound design is also minimal, but well done.  Certain audio cues can give you hints to where you are in the world, and the simple tick-tock of a clock can become a fixture of an entire portion of the game.  It’s definitely a polished game which looks and feels nice.\n\nOf course, the real meat of Antichamber is the puzzles, and it’s hard to say much about them without revealing part of what makes this game special.  Suffice it to say that it is one of the most unique and creative games that I have ever played.  Environments are frequently non-Euclidean in nature, and rely heavily on perspective or understanding the rules of the universe which Antichamber itself has defined.\n\nThere is inherent difficulty in designing that kind of puzzle; if you don’t abide necessarily by the rules of physics or perspective that we’ve come to rely on, puzzles can have arbitrarily hard solutions.  For the most part, especially in early parts of the game, Antichamber does an excellent job of staying consistent and teaching you the ways of its mind-melting world.\n\nBut in the later hours, you are bound to run into situations where a puzzle solution will feel almost entirely arbitrary.  Frustration will set in, and occasionally solutions don’t have the satisfying payoff they were designed for. There was one instance where I resorted to some online hints because, it turns out, I had completed an earlier puzzle in a non-traditional way and didn’t have the resources the game expected me to have.  It took quite a bit of digging before finally understanding how I was supposed to complete the prior puzzle so I could complete the current one.\n\nOne very smart addition to curb some of this difficulty is the ability to, at any point, press escape and jump out to the central hub of the world.  From there, you can see your progress and also a map of the entire area you have so-far discovered.  You can jump in to any area you’ve previously visited, and I found it helpful to jump from puzzle to puzzle I didn’t know how to solve.  Typically inspiration would strike somewhere, and my frustrations would yield relatively quickly.\n\nOverall, Antichamber is a smart, mostly incredible puzzle game.  Moments of frustration are almost inevitable here, and for the most part the balance is hit just right so that frustration results in joyous satisfaction when you make progress. It occasionally missteps and frustration just leads to greater frustration, but it’s easy to forgive when so much of the game is so good.  Highly recommended.","November 17, 2014","true","7.2"," 243 of 250 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","243","250","4","0"

It is a puzzle adventure game similar to Portal. You have many different types of guns that can modify the blocks around you to help you solve puzzles. In addition, Antichamber uses a variety of different ways to mess with your head, such as the countless numbers of geometrical paradoxies. For example, you can walk through walls that you thought were solid. If you turn around at almost any point of the game the end will be right behind you.

Then this is the game for you.\n\nAntichamber is a game that throws you into a maze like a blind puppy. You are left to wonder around, confused and completely alone. Every turn you make is just another step in no direction. While you can beat the game in only 5 minutes, the real fun is how deep into the game can you get before getting extremely confused? I mean, I haven't even finished the game yet myself, but I have had so much fun. Oh, and do NOT use a walkthrough. Even though the game is a maze, it is only one maze. It doesn't change. If you use a walkthrough, you just basically wasted the $20/$10/$6.66/Whatever you paid for it. There really isn't much else to say about the game without ruining it. It's got simply yet beautiful visuals, and the "puzzles" are very immersive. Most parts of the maze don't care only about where you where. There are times where it depend son where you are looking, or HOW you are walking.\n\nIf you want some brain bending, buy this. If you just want a game to waste a good 5-15 hours on, then buy this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/219890/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nThe Definition of Antichamber is “Brainteaser”. Antichamber is an indie puzzle game developed by Alexander Bruce (“Demruth”), Antichamber was released 2013 and is an excellent puzzle game that you should get right now.\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: To my understanding there really isn't a “story”, not in the literal sense. You start the game working your way through puzzle after puzzle trying to get to the exit. There is a strong sense of progression and rewards for completing various puzzles, so in a way that's the story driving you... completing the puzzles and getting to the end.\n\nGameplay: The controls are very straightforward, and the game explains how to play as you play... Unless you miss one of the hints like I did once I got the yellow gun. I had to wander around the game for hours before returning to the original place I picked up the gun and noticed the tutorial tip.\nAs you progress through the game you obtain a gun, then upgrade that gun to get a different unique ability that will help you solve new puzzles and sometimes make the old puzzles easier. Just like any good puzzle game, each puzzle is tougher then the last, and often times dynamically different.\nThis is probably one of the hardest puzzle games I've ever played, Antichamber forces you to think about puzzle games in a whole different way (“To think outside the box”), and after you've gotten used to thinking a certain way for one puzzle the next requires you to think of a solution a different way.\nThere were a number of times playing Antichamber I thought “Yeah! I broke that puzzle with my creative solution” only to find out that the game actually EXPECTED me to figure that solution out the way I did. Expect twisted solutions, creative planning, strategic thinking, and down right mind screwing.\n\nAchievements: At the time that I'm writing this review, there aren't any achievements (07/23/15) but they could easily be added later with a patch. The game already has many goals and hidden pathways that you can find. Including added difficulty if you're trying to beat the game in a short time.\n\nPrice: Antichamber is priced at $19.99, as most people who have consistently read my reviews knows, I like to spend an hour playing a game for every dollar.\nSo far I've spent 6.3 hours in the game, but it has a high replay value because puzzle games are always easy to come back to play, even after beating them. (I forget solutions to the puzzles and go through the whole process again!)\nAll in all, this game is definitely worth it to me, because I've enjoyed the challenges and the puzzles I've figured out on my own. (Just saying, I haven't looked up any solutions, if I got stuck I would go to another puzzle in the game!)\n\nConclusion: To quickly recap: Story, Not applicable. Gameplay, excellent, challenging, exciting, confusing, winning. Achievements, Not Applicable at this time. Price, fair, better if you purchase it when on sale.\nI recommend this game to people who enjoy puzzle games (especially difficult puzzle games) For those of you who have played Portal... think of some of the most twisted... crazy... test chambers you might play on Portal? This game is like that, almost the whole time. It's awesome.\nI think this game deserves a play, and even if you're not fond of puzzle games, the developers are indie so they could definitely use the support!\nAs always, thanks for reading my review.","July 23, 2015","true","8.2"," 91 of 95 people (96%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","96","91","95","9","2"

Even through a relatively simple mechanic of interaction with the environment - i.e laying blcoks down and picking them up - it cultivates a very real sense of agency for the player.\n\nThe game is not linear at all, in fact most of my difficulties happened because I was trying to do some puzzles before I had the rescources to do them. The paths branch off in all directions, and there are multiple ways into nearly every room. Each puzzle teaches you specific aspects of the rules, with later puzzles and abilites building and expanding on those lessons. All of this happens in a place where the laws of physics and spacial reality do not apply. I've had lots of my friends try playing this game, its crazy to see how differently they approach things.\n\nMy favorite part of the game though is how you create the narrative for yourself.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/219890/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Antichamber wants to screw with you. An abstract puzzle game, it exists in a world built upon its own rules, requiring you to shed conventional logic and adopt an out of the box mindset to progress through the labyrinthine chamber you find yourself in. Up is down, going backwards moves you forward, and nothing can be taken at face value. It's one of the smartest games I've ever played; thoughtfully evolving at every step, as my feeble brain scrambled to keep up.\n\nTo attempt and describe Antichamber would be counterproductive, and a rather hopeless task. The foundation of the experience is designed around self discovery and interpretation, making any outside explanation of how to solve the absurdly clever puzzles and navigate the twisting level layouts detrimental to someone playing the game for the first time. At its core, Antichamber involves manipulating the rules of its world to allow you to overcome seemingly impossible tasks and continue onward toward the next puzzle. More often than not this involves interacting with blocks placed throughout, by way of a gun whose functions extend far beyond the simple ability to move and delete.\n\nThough outwardly simplistic and plain, Antichamber's art direction (and to a lesser extent its sound design) is as purposely and meticulously designed as its puzzles; with clean lines and intelligent use of color all playing a large role in telegraphing integral aspects of the puzzles. Its basic graphical design also accounts for a huge portion of how atmospheric Antichamber can be. Often times I'd find myself so drawn into the experience that I'd look up to find to my surprise I'd been engross in it for hours, as time becomes rather meaningless once you begin to make your way through the chamber. It feels like being inside an abstract painting, with as much artistry and inverted syllogism as you would expect.\n\nThe moments when you manage to solve a puzzle and move forward in Antichamber is one of the most satisfying feelings I've ever had in a puzzle game, which is why it's unfortunate that its intelligence can at times become a handicap; blocking the player from continuing onward and giving little knowledge of how to do so or where they might should head in instances where its functionally impossible to progress without collecting an upgrade first. This is a deliberate aspect of Antichamber's design and a large factor in why solving its conundrums is so empowering, but it has the unshakable counter effect of turning people away on the basis that the game is simply too smart for them (especially early on). It's a shame because once you begin to understand the way the world works the game really opens up and you can finally appreciate it in all its glory, but to get there you'll inevitably be hitting your head against the wall quite a bit as you try and make sense of it all.\n\nAntichamber is a rather intimidating game even to those with a mind for puzzles and an ease at thinking irrationally, but its one that's worth forcing yourself through the first few confounding hours for the brilliant moments of understanding that follow. The ingenuity of Alexander Bruce's abstruse creation is mindboggling (which I mean quite literally), and an incredible accomplishment that I honestly cannot believe came together without falling apart under the weight of its own ambition. I still only barely understand it, but even my limited intelligence can appreciate how remarkable Antichamber is; making me feel clever even as I can fell it silently mocking me for being the comparative imbecile I am.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","July 27, 2014","true","7.5"," 69 of 73 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","69","73","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/recommended/219890/","noibn","noibn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/","1756 products in account","Early on in Antichamber, you will come across a room comprised of large floating letters that state "W T F ?". This pretty much sums up the experience... but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's quite refreshing, actually. But let's start at the beginning - what is Antichamber exactly? It's not easy to explain. It's a puzzle game, but the puzzles you solve are not exactly of a traditional nature. The game is set in some sort of nondescript facility, comprised of interconnected hallways and chambers. Visually, the world is quite simple, made up mostly of bright white walls with a spattering of color here and there. You explore in first person and must figure out how to solve each room in order to progress. And that's where it gets even harder to explain. The solutions are far from clear-cut and there is no one main mechanic that is used from start to finish. You just have to think, experiment, and explore. Eventually you will find a tool that is able to manipulate small cubes that are scattered throughout the facility. But unlike in a puzzle game like Portal for instance, the cube "gun" is not the only component of the puzzle-solving experience (though it does become so later on). Rather, at first, you will likely just spend a couple of hours exploring, getting lost, and trying to figure out just what the hell is going on. It takes a little while to adapt to how the game wants you to think, but once you have learned how to solve certain problems, it opens up more of the world for you to explore. I know this explanation sounds very vague, but it's almost impossible not to be when trying to explain this game - it is very... unconventional. That said, I thought the game was really cool, though I can definitely see that it would not be for everyone. If you like games that have a clear goal, explain their mechanics well, and don't require much thinking, then this is most definitely not the game for you. If, on the other hand, you are curious to try something that is vague, never provides anything in the way of explanation, and has some truly "out-there" puzzles to solve, you just might find Antichamber to be a breath of fresh air. All in all, this is a worthy experiment in the puzzle game genre, and unlike anything else I have ever played. Check it out if you think it may interest you - just don't hold me responsible for how much hair you end up pulling out of your head in frustration.\n\nFinal Grade: B+","June 2, 2013","true","7.1"," 69 of 79 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","69","79","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dinoracha/recommended/219890/","dinoracha","Dinoracha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dinoracha/","426 products in account","A game like Antichamber should not be played by people like myself; games that have puzzles that go beyond merely logic, reasoning, memorization or problem solving and into the realm of beating your head against it until a solution reveals itself do not sit entirely well with me. This is more an issue with myself than those types of games for sure, but while Antichamber does take a couple of cues from Portal, this title is a drastically different experience that, while at times went way over my head, I can still recommend to people who want a puzzler that's different from your Trines or Professor Laytons or Mysts.\n\nI'm really the wrong demographic for this kind of game, but Antichamber's advertising suckered me in since I wanted an exploration-based puzzle game in similar veins to La-Mulana; puzzles that were made to crush lesser minds. While I did get that vibe and happily did so, Antichamber sometimes felt like it could get away with whatever it wanted and did so with crossed arms and shrugged shoulders to the player. The Steam store page does say, quote, 'Antichamber is a mind-bending psychological exploration game where nothing can be taken for granted. Discover an Escher-like world where hallways wrap around upon each other, spaces reconfigure themselves, and accomplishing the impossible may just be the only way forward'. 'Accomplishing the impossible' may sound quite romantic to a player thinking about buying the game, but there are some cases where the impossible is possible, it just requires a ridiculous solution. To talk about these cases would just be absolute shameful spoilers and would take away from your experience, but the big pro tip here is that just when you think you've tried absolutely everything and are ready to give up, you actually haven't tried absolutely everything and need to try again. Not every puzzle in Antichamber is this 'impossible', as for a majority of the game your challenges are quite tame; blocks, switches, platforming, interacting with the environment, toying with some anomaly that's keeping you from progressing... Many of these can be solved just through expirimentation, trial and error or simple application of your brain, and for quite some time you can chug through the game at a steady rate, only meeting major opposition when you near the end of the game - And I mean major. Again, perhaps I'm the wrong kind of person for this kind of game, but at some point I ran up against puzzles where just nothing clicked and I found myself spinning my wheels in perpetual defeat, and that's where my enjoyment of the game took a heavy drop.\n\nWhat kept me from really getting sour on the game is that at just about any time you can return to the main 'hub' room where you can look at a map of the 'facility' (players have insinuated there's a story some kind, but there's no plot in Antichamber at all) and then teleport elsewhere. This means that you can zip around the game and try assaulting a puzzle again or from a different angle, never being stuck against just one challenge forever until you complete it. This is an absolute god-send of a feature, and one that no doubt has kept many players (including myself) from quitting the game with a bitter aftertaste. It's also incredibly useful since you can stumble upon shortcuts or alternate exits everywhere that will take you all over the place, sometimes not quite in the direction you wanted to go. If you keep hallway-wrapping into a room you've visited or accidentally fall off a bridge that melts if you're looking at it, being able to warp back and try again keeps frustration down to a minimum, especially when you're trying to find the matter 'guns' to further manipulate blocks that you need for switches, platforms or other impede your progress.\n\nThe 'guns' is the aforementioned cue from Portal, and how they help you get around the game is the other. Again, to talk in detail about the puzzles you'll encounter would be shameful spoilers, but each new gun upgrade you find unlocks that much more of the game, with a myriad of possible solutions and new challenges to run into, which is a good feeling of constantly asking yourself 'what's next?' when you unlock this door or find a way past this chasm. You'll be looking forward to the next puzzle and not to the designs of the rooms as a whole since the game's sterile white environment at times feels just downright oppressive on the eyes, save for the splashes of bold, full colors that are strangely relieving when mixed in with the 'music' that is nothing but ambiance noises that I feel were designed to keep the player as relaxed as possible when hopping around the game trying to figure out a new solution. Color doesn't play any sort of theme like in Okami, but it does serve as something to take hold of your attention and to differentiate one route from another to avoid confusion.\n\nWhile it sounds like I haven't had the greatest time with Antichamber, I walked away from it (and completed it) quite satisfied with the experience I had, and some minor technical hiccups like major frame-rate hitches during transitions and broken floor geometry were just that - Hiccups. Antichamber brings to the table a wildly different kind of puzzle game that sometimes can feel like it's cheating in order to challenge you, but overcoming these challenges brings personal accomplishment that is its own high. My overall enjoyment of the game left something to be desired, but I can still happily recommend Antichamber to those looking for a puzzle game that doesn't follow conventional rules.","October 14, 2014","true","10.1"," 59 of 67 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","59","67","2","0"

Yep, math and puzzles are not my best.\n\nBut, this game is different. Sure, it does take a lot of thinking, so after a long while of moving around aimlessly, I said "Well, why not checking a walkthrough? ♥♥♥♥ it, I'll do it, I really wanna finish this game, but my head hurts and I don't wanna end up killing myself."\n\nAnd...Jesus. This game.\n\nI freaking love the simplistic design of it, sometimes it looks as if somebody was just drawing lines on a piece of white paper with a pencil. Sure, that looks....Bland at times. But what really shines in here, is when you are suddenly walking in pitch black rooms with bright colors, bright colors in white rooms that look like splattered ink, stuff like that. This game does really make you feel like you are trapped alone in some kind of weird ever changing place like in that movie, The Cube. The M.C Escher like geometry in here is awesome, too.\n\nControl wise, it's the bare basics of a first person game, nothing too great about this one, but it isn't bad, neither.\n\nSound....Well....there is silence, silence, the ocassional ambient sounds, and look! Silence. It really builds up the atmosphere of loneliness, creepy at times, too, like in a certain pitch black tunnel.\n\n\nYou will frequently get lost, cry, and more often than not, you will say to yourself "Where the ♥♥♥♥ am I?"\n\nAlso, another one of the things I love so much about this game.\nThis game is full of signs with simple white drawings on a black background. When you click each one, you will get a phrase. All of those phrases are perfect for your everyday life, for succeeding, and for when you are truly down and depressed.\n\nSome examples:\n\n"Failing to succeed does not mean failing to progress."\n"A dead end will only stop you if you don't try to move through it."\n"When you've hit rock bottom, the only way is up."\n"If you never stop trying, you will get there eventually."\n"Falling down teaches us how to get up and try again"\n"We can appreciate the entire journey by looking back at how far we have come."\n\nThere is 120 of those, and jeez, it's definitely one of my favorite points about this game.\n\nAll in all, definitely try it, if you love a challenge and thinking outside of the box, here you go! If you are like me, who wants to see the game and read the signs, then, there are also walkthroughs you can follow, so don't sweat it.\n\nBTW......The ending.....Wtf. I'm speechless.","January 26, 2015","true","7.0"," 42 of 47 people (89%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","89","42","47","10","0"

The graphics really add to the atmosphere and the music is alright if nothing special, while it's enjoyable at first it simply loops for the duration of the game and becomes old rather quickly. The puzzles are extremely diverse and become progressively harder as the game goes on, and while easy at first can and will become very challenging.

Most of the details, including some very fine ones, are not revealed directly to you. You MUST experiment to work your way through this game.\n- I like the design concept of the "main menu".\n- The graphics are super simplistic (MSPaint simplistic), but I actually like that for this particular experience.\n\n(Possible) Cons:\n\n- The abstract puzzle solving! For the most part, I enjoyed exploring what I thought might be the solution to a puzzle and being wrong. There were a few times, though, when being right felt kind of dumb.\n- I crashed the game about five times. Every time was due to one specific mechanic, wherein the game engine is evidently not designed to handle what I was doing to it.\n- There is no real story and reaching the game's end is underwhelming.

The game clearly has its own consistent internal logic and random things don't just occur to mess with the player's head. However, many of Antichamber's puzzles depend on upsetting the usual order of things to - if the tablets of advice hidden around the game are to be believed - teach a lesson about life.  It is not terribly uncommon, for example, to turn around and find yourself in a different place than where you came from. It makes no logical sense, but over time, it becomes a reasonable solution. While still sporting more straightforward puzzles like covering a series of sensors with a limited number of blocks, Antichamber seems to more often beg the player to look at the problem sideways. Instead of looking for tools to get around obstacles, understand that every situation may not operate under the same set of rules. Be willing to adjust assumptions based on new observations. But these observations need to be made independently by the player as the game itself provides no real external assistance; even the ultimate purpose of the game isn't handed to the player. Without guidance, you're left to discover your own meaning to the strange and sometimes inconsistent world around you - just as everyone must do as they progress through life.","October 12, 2015","true","11.0"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","22","22","2","0"

Antichamber is one of a kind. If I was to compare it to any other games I have played, the closest would be the Portal franchise, but even that is only similar in first impression, usage of a non-lethal weapon-like instrument and making you use your brain. There, the similarity ends.\nWhile in most other titles the game teaches you in the beginning about its own peculiarities, Antichamber does not. You are never prepared for the quirks of its play with spatial dimensions, unstable matter or anything else you encounter. You are to figure out everyrhing by yourself. And this is one of it's many beauties.\nThis is not a game just about puzzles. It is a game about self-exploration through solving puzzles. The philosophical pictures and phrases that you find while solving puzzles don't only help you understand the weird world of Antichamber, but can also help you in the weird real world.\nNowadays there are many games, ranging from Crysis to Portal that to a smaller or greater extent make you think out of the box in order to overcome a certain obstacle. Well, Antichamber isn't one of those. It has NO BOX. You can never be sure about what you will find if you keep walking forward. Or if you turn. Or even if you look back. Or if you look forward again after looking back. Sometimes, you fell as if the only way to solve a puzzle is by tricking the game mechanic and after solving it, you realise that this is exactly the way the puzzle was intended to be solved. At the same time, unlike many other games of similar genre, it strangely feels alive on its own. The rooms, the dimensions do not just stay there where you left them. It leaves an impression that while you are absent from the rooms and corridors, they continue to live on their own. The cubes move around, the walls relocate. As soon as you appear in that strange, distorted universe, you feel alien in there. But this alienation is not of a menacing kind, but of a kind that encourages you to explore the world around you. And as you do that, the Antichamber more and more feels more than an strange trans-dimensional labyrinth. It feels like it is a being that functions independently and when you come there, it decides to interact with you.\n","December 4, 2013","true","26.0"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

Puzzles were challenging without ever really feeling unfair (except for one instance: but it turned out to be an optional puzzle so i don't feel like I missed very much.) Great fun for anyone that loves the puzzle genre and can handle the potential headaches of navigating things that don't quite make sense, unless you force it to.\n\nThings that annoyed me: There are a few precise platforming moments that feel awkward in the FPS scheme, and there was one puzzle that relied on an annoying jumping mechanic where I knew how to solve it but couldn't make the stiff platforming work 'properly' for lack of a better word.\n\nEverything else was fantastic. I beat the game and I still have some puzzles left unsolved. Some of them seem to lead to hidden side areas that only exist for the satisfaction of getting there.","November 21, 2014","true","8.1"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","0"

The first thing the player sees are these words: "Every journey is a series of choices. The first is to begin the journey." Players then turn to find a second wall labeled "All You Need to Know" that displays the options and the control scheme for the game, as well as a third wall labeled "Choose Your Destination" that acts as Antichamber's sort of level select feature. The map on this wall is initially only one room big, forcing players to select the very first room with only a vague idea of what this first "level" might hold for them.\n\nFrom there Antichamber is very loosely organized, with players often being presented with multiple paths that lead to separate rooms on the map. Antichamber is often called a puzzle game, though its developers have more accurately labeled it a "mind-bending psychological exploration game". And in order to play Antichamber, your mind will have to bend—often into complex, pretzel-like contortions. The puzzle rooms of Antichamber frequently involve doing the opposite of what you expect. Each one requires creative thinking and the rooms often make up there own set of rules in order to solve them and then expect the player to figure each one out. Some rooms want you to walk quietly. Some rooms are shy and don't want you to look at them. Some rooms will only play fair if you walk backwards the whole time you're in them. Each puzzle is odd and unique, though I rarely found myself being frustrated. More often, I was enamored with their perturbingly unorthodox logic.\n\nShould players grow irritated with a puzzle, however, a simple press of the ESC button will bring you straight back to where you started: the Main Hub. As you continue through the game, your map slowly expands into twisted corridors with labeled puzzle rooms listed on it, allowing you to transport yourself to any puzzle you've already encountered (though not always solved!). Along the way, players will often come upon black and white signs hanging on the walls in the hallways of Antichamber. The very first wall of the game, called the Moral Wall by fans, collects these signs, each one a black and white cartoon picture containing some sage words of advice when clicked.\n\nThe true beginning of Antichamber begins a handful of puzzle rooms in, when the player collects their very first Matter Gun, a weapon whose only ability is to collect and shoot out little colored cubes. There are five Matter Guns total, with each new gun being an upgrade from the last.  Each one comes with its own set of abilities and rules that make more complex puzzles solvable, but in order to use the guns players are required to discover these abilities and rules with very little direction from the game itself. It's this lack of direction that makes Antichamber so clever: the game never tells you how a puzzle should be solved or even how to use most of the equipment it gives you to solve those puzzles. Players are required to pave their own way, developing and creating new techniques to tackle constantly changing challenges and sticky situations. Soon players end up with a large set of skills that have slowly been discovered through hours of trial and error.\n\nAntichamber's journey has a quiet, unstated goal: there are no waypoints or quest lists to follow. Your only clue on where to go is the mysterious, flowing worm of black matter that appears early on in the game and the undeniable urge to delve deeper into the mysteries of Antichamber's hallways. However, a game like Antichamber does not need a strong sense of character or story. Antichamber places a higher value on gameplay and ingenuity than narrative, though the game is no less immersive because of it. In fact, Antichamber's atmosphere is enhanced by the silence of its white hallways and the player's fumbling, stumbling exploration of its convoluted structure.\n\nPeople often believe Antichamber to be a sort of Portal clone—you're locked in an inescapable labyrinth, armed with a dubiously effective gun, and presented with a series of puzzles to solve. However, Antichamber is barely comparable to Portal. It is a more somber game, with a much less linear style of gameplay that is focused more on discovery and learning than the progression of a plot. You do not connect things, you create and destroy. You guess and postulate and trip and balk. There's no smooth sequences of flying through the air or near misses with laser beams or perfectly timed jumps. There's only a slow contemplation and the constant sensation of reaching into a dark hole and feeling your fingertips graze against something warm and smoky before it just slips away.\n\nThere are some games that I'm afraid to review. They're often games that, no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to find any noticeable flaws—games that I've become so pleased with that I would almost dare to call myself biased. Antichamber is one of those games that I've fallen in love with, a kind of unflinchingly blind sort of love that leaves me unable to see any of its faults. As such, it's no surprise that I'm giving it a positive review with the addition of a rarely ordered command: buy this game. Buy it now, and let yourself flounder in its often backwards and inside out logic.","January 2, 2015","true","13.9"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","14","14","2","0"

For that reason I'll avoid talking about specific puzzles in this review.\n\nAntichamber regularly breaks the rules. It does so very carefully, building upon its own kind of logic. Puzzle solutions that might seem too random or illogical if they were in another game, here are made to work through a masterful progression that subtly teaches you how to explore each new challenge.\n\nIn many ways it feels like you are visiting another universe that is similar, but not entirely the same as our own. As you play you are constantly questioning things that you otherwise would take for granted in order to learn the laws of this place. As you look around, the visuals are simple and easy to discern, yet often striking. Occasionally there are some uninteresting white rooms but by and large their use of line weight, perspective, color and contrast make for a memorable display.\n\nThe most familiar and comforting aspects of this world are its sounds. Sounds of nature, from birds chirping to thunderclaps, are at times paired with the right swaths of color to evoke serene feelings of home. The music is mostly content to quietly set the mood until the final stages of the game where it livens up slightly with a primal drum beat. This is at once both unexpected and strangely fitting with all the sounds of the wilderness featured prior.\n\nEach of the puzzles you solve typically rewards you with, and is sometimes preceded by, a sign on the wall that has a picture and a short phrase. They are written with a double meaning: part lifestyle mantra, part hint or clever tie-in to the puzzle you've just completed. I've seen some negative responses to these posters, calling them pretentious and full of themselves. I disagree. I see them as cute, tongue-in-cheek rewards for our efforts that are meant to be taken about as seriously as a fortune cookie. They may also be teaching you to play more than realized. Without a discernible over-arching story to the game, they further add to the game by giving it a voice and a bit of personality.\n\nMy chief complaint stems out of a system that I don't want to detail in order to avoid spoilers. Let's just say that in the middle portion of the game you are sometimes able to manufacture materials needed to solve puzzles. However, the process to do so isn't interesting and got tiresome as I had to repeat it while piecing together the proper solution to the problem at hand. It may be that I played things too conservatively by making more than I needed, but in a game that throws you so many curveballs, can you blame me? This problem is alleviated toward the end, but I would argue that this relief should have been fit in sooner.\n\nAntichamber exceeded my expectations and ranks in as one of the best puzzle games I've ever played.","May 6","true","7.9"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

The game attempts to make you forget everything you learned from playing first person games in the past, and learn new rules that apply only within its world. This might leave you confused at first, but you soon learn to play by the game's own rules and this is when the experience becomes something truly remarkable. The puzzles are very creative and some of them will have you squeeze every bit of brain you have to solve them. The art direction and music both combine to put you in a sort of zen mood where you are focused on understanding the world and solving the puzzles. Sometimes the controls don't do what you want them to do and this can be frustrating.

Knowing about it early on in it's "Hazard: The Journey of Life" stages, when it was merely a mod for UT3, I knew it was on it's way to becoming a great title; 2013 GOTY possibility.\nSoon after release, I collaborated on Reddit with /u/raulness to become the Antichamber subreddit community head. I invite any Redditors to come down to /r/antichamber for a visit. We are mainly speedrun-oriented, but any Antichamber content is accepted.\nThen a few days later, I was able to collaborate with Prochamber on the Antichamber Wiki to become one of the two Antichamber Wiki Admins. We still have a lot of unfinished work to be done on the wiki, so I invite you all to come visit and make a few edits; don't be scared to add wrong information, it can be fixed.\nFinally, I learned of a small community who were speedrunning it, and attempting to route out the best/fastest possible path. Within a few days I was able to head this community as well. I've spent countless hours (well... you can see the number right there, but that's beside the point) routing and running in this community, learning more than I ever thought I would know about this great game (Edit: Like all the bug abuse that we thought was completely impossible for the first 6-7 months of release).\nWhether you're looking for a new speedgame, or just something great for a casual playthrough, Antichamber is amazing.

After playing it myself, I have to say this game feels more like "learning to *think* backwards."\n\nAntichamber is a first-person puzzle game that plays with the idea of non-newtonian space. This means that if you walk down a hallway and turn around, what's behind you isn't necessarily the same as what you just walked through. There are a couple of points in the game where the only way to progress is to walk right back where you came from, which turns out not to be the same place at all.\nThe process of learning to deal with non-newtonian space is confusing for some, although I have to admit that I am not one of those people. If you approach each room as a puzzle and ignore your ideas of what is in front of you or behind you, (as well as some real-world ideas like 'common sense,') the game itself is not actually very difficult.\nWhat nailed this game for me was the atmosphere. Set in what many have described as an Escher-esque world, the game's stark minimalism and use of visual space meant that even though the entire complex is built out of white walls, there was always something interesting to look at or think about. In some ways, I found this atmosphere to better than that of Portal - while GlaDos made the Portal series fun to listen to, with an ever-present and witty dialogue that provided much of the tone and narrative depth for the game, Antichamber removes the narrator entirely and forces the player to decide how much - or how little - narrative is present in the game at all. The lack of a Narrator Voice lets the game's own tone settle in the player's thoughts more closely, a tone that I can only describe at varying times as 'child-like discovery' and 'calm confusion', as oxymoronic as that last statement might seem.\nAntichamber is the kind of game that is best played without a guide, not knowing where to go next, with as much or as little confusion as that might bring you. This is one of those few interesting games that can intrigue storytellers and non-story gamers alike with a dialogue and narrative that barely exist, in a setting that does not conform to the vast majority of popular videogames.","January 7, 2015","true","4.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","1"

While we're describing it concisely, another description: "incredibly well made."  The level of polish and detail put into every aspect of this game is admirable on its own, but the developers get a fair amount of extra credit for doing so on a game that focuses so heavily on things that break the laws of physics.\n\nThe puzzles here are very well done, some being relatively simple while others take some complex reasoning to understand.  None of it is using cheap "gotcha" logic, that annoying brand of "the only way you'll figure this out is by guessing randomly" that entirely too many puzzle games fall afoul of.  There is a firm logic to this game, even if that logic could never work in our reality.\n\nAs far as the setting of the game goes, it's truly minimalistic (as I mentioned before).  There's no lore, no narration, no plot structure to speak of.  The rooms themselves are all but untextured, relying on cell-shaded lines to show boundaries for the most part.  This would present a challenge in most other game genres, but for a puzzle game it's wonderful.  No distractions, no hamfisted attempts at making this more than what it is.  The conclusion to the final puzzle, such as it is, is a little confusing given the lack of context, but that's arguably what was intended.  By and large, the gameplay-focused setting is an outstanding choice.  Here are your controls, here are some puzzles, figure it out, and have fun.\n\nThe only other thing that can really be talked about in this game is the overall enjoyment factor, and I'm happy to say it's quite high.  The well-designed but often intensely clever puzzles are a head trip to figure out and very satisfying to solve.   Even the ones you've already figured out can be fun to revisit as you gain upgraded equipment, especially as some of them have multiple ways of being solved and multiple paths to take from there.\n\nSo, conclusion time: this game is great at two things: breaking your brain, and presenting you with fun puzzles to solve.  While it's not the first game to present the player with impossible physics, I can think of no other game that demonstrates so many and in such variety, much less making them the sole focus of a very enjoyable game.  It's enough that I would say even if you don't like puzzle games you should play Antichamber at least once, if only for the experience.","April 1, 2015","true","10.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

At first sight it may seem sharp with such colors, but after the first 5-10 minutes of gameplay you get used to it.\nTricks with space in this game are the best I've ever seen. Some of them can be found in Super Mario Bros. (in the last castle) or in The Stanley Parable. Unlike these games, Antichamber is a game about such tricks themselves.\nThis game doesn't have a plot in usual meaning. In the beginning you just appear somewhere and start to explore environment and game mechanics. After you find the first "gun" things become much more intresting.\nIf you like psychological, thought-out, extraordinary games, then you would  surely love this game.\nP.S. This game was developed for ~8 years (2006-2013, as it is said in developer's notes inside the game)","December 28, 2013","true","9.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Because it's so confusing in the beginning that I lacked solid elements on which to build a judgement. Said judgement began to form halfway through, and never really deviated until the end.\n\nThe first thing that strikes about Antichamber is its very unique and distinct graphical personality. It's essentially a black-and-white cell-shaded world made of straight lines, with touches of primary colours here and there, a couple shades of grey, and (almost) no gradient. It sure doesn't look bad in screenshots, but it needs to be experienced rather than just seen to really appreciate it. The graphics are striking, and even though they barely vary throughout the game, Antichamber is short enough that it doesn't become a problem.\n\nGoing hand in hand with the unique look is the great soundtrack. I say soundtrack, but in truth there isn't any "song". It's more a collection of ambient soundscapes that blend seamlessly into each other as you navigate the mazes. It's beautiful but also unsettling because, in stark contrast with the cold and precide graphics, the sounds are very organic and often originate from real-life sounds like pigeons cooing, for example. There is a soundtrack CD/digital download (actually, there are two of them) on bandcamp, which I will probably buy at some point even though they are just static renditions of the organic/procedural in-game soundscapes.\n\nSo, unquestionably, Antichamber is a great place to explore. But Antichamber is not Proteus: It's a real game, with puzzles to solve. And this is where stuff start to disappoint somewhat.\n\nPuzzles come in two varieties. The first kind involves finding your way in Antichamber's very personal take on geometry. This is not the kind of place where turning left four consecutive times will necessarily take you back to your starting point. Antichamber's space folds on itself in all kinds of intricate ways. Somehow, those puzzles are reminiscent of the parts in games like Dungeon Master (or Legend of Grimrock) where only a specific sequence of moves will let you advance and any other sequence would lead you in circles. And, if your memory of them is similar to mine, these were usually not the best parts. Of course, it's more diverse than that. Strictly speaking, many of the "strange geometry" puzzles involve completely different mechanisms, but the feeling is kind of the same. In essence, those puzzles are less about thinking your way through than about trying everything that crosses your mind.\n\nThe second variety involves cube manipulation. Early on you'll get some "gun" that will let you manipulate the small cubes that feature in many puzzles. Those are usually solved by filling some space with the cubes. Achieving this will often unlock doors and let you progress. There are different "guns" that will progressively allow you to manipulate cubes in new ways. These puzzles are much more logical in nature than the first kind. But they're not always well designed. Very frequently, I would solve them in way that felt inelegant. I thought I was using a glitch-like solution and that there must have been a more clever, satisfying way to solve them. Unfortunately, it appears that it isn't always the case: the game's official FAQ acknowledges that some solutions may feel "like a clever exploit of the mechanics" or "like a slow brute force way of doing things".\n\nAntichamber is very non-linear. Not just geometrically, but also in temrs of progressions. You have access to a vast array of unsolved puzzles at all times. The positive consequence is that there wasn't a single moment when I felt completely stuck. Every time I fired the game, however briefly, I would at least solve a couple of puzzles. This is good, and all the better because Antichamber can be approached as a pick-up-and-play experience if one feels like it: It loads lightning-fast and constantly saves your progress.\n\nThere is a flipside to this non-linearity: you also have access to many puzzles which you cannot solve because you don't have the right gun. And you have no way of distinguishing them from those you can solve. Another collateral damage of non-linearity is that many times, I solved a difficult puzzle only to find myself at a place I had already reached through another puzzle. It's hard to find a great sense of accomplishment in those cases.\n\nOne last grief: NOT EVERYONE HAS A QWERTY KEYBOARD!!! I don't want to change my Windows keyboard settings every time I play a game just because my A and W keys are not where you think they are! Let the user customize the controls.\n\nOverall, I would still recommend Antichamber because it's a unique experience. It's also a beautiful one. The puzzles do get in the way, but because they are not that difficult (despite first appearances)and because Antichamber is short, it's bearable. Just don't expect that the puzzle design will come anywhere near Portal-quality and you should be fine.","November 30, 2013","true","6.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Most people compare it to Portal, which is a fair parallel although Portal is more weighted towards personality and humor whereas Antichamber is focused almost enitrely on the puzzles and your environment.\n\nThe game is not super long - assuming you don't get stuck on puzzles for a really long time - so most people are probably looking at 5-10 hours of gameplay before "beating" the game unless you are some kind of puzzle god. Fun fact: the world record speedruns around around 2-3 minutes for this game! Of course, the game is always fun to play through more than once and trying to go for speed aids replayability. It's also fun to play with friends though it can be hard to draw the line between bestowing small hints to them and giving too much away so that the puzzle is spoiled.\n\nThe puzzles reward lateral thinking. Many puzzles can be solved in different ways; sometimes they can be solved before they are "supposed to be" solve. Sometimes puzzles can even be skipped entirely. The game subtly hints to the player that the game is more about exploring and becoming a stronger thinker than "winning" the game. Some areas don't really lead anywhere and aren't necessary for the technical completion.\n\nBeyond the gameplay, Antichamber is an example of incredible design. The visuals at first glance are simple: most of the environment is white. The floors and walls are devoid of detail. There aren't a whole lot of colors beyond white and black in some areas of the game. That's not to say the graphics are bad though. Every visual is clearly thought through and offers a innovative beauty. Distractions are eliminated with this choice. The space through which you navigate is not too small and not too large.\n\nThe interesting part about the physical layout though is that the game uses a lot of non-euclidean geometry. Not only is this entertaining and fascinating to explore, it lends a sense of mystique to this world you are thrust into. Through the warping of space and dimensional conventions, Antichamber toys with your brain and is constantly threatening to trick your mind.\n\nThe audio choices are also fantastic for Antichamber. There's nothing distracting - nothing loud or obnoxious - to draw attention away from the game. There is quiet music of sorts, although the atmospheric sound is mostly relaxing noises reminiscent of beaches and birds among other things. It is quiet and along with the simplistic visual design creates a really unique personality for the game that totally won me over right away. The quiet reminds you of how truly empty the space is and how alone you are as the player.\n\nYou're not entirely alone though. Throughout the game there are simple black pictures present on walls. Clicking these changes the picture into a brief sentence. These sentences are usually vaguely motivational in nature and also serve as subtle hints to aid in progressing further into the game. I adore their presence and it really is a great example of design. It makes you feel less alone because it's almost like the game is sentient and congratulating you when you discover new areas.\n\nThere is no narration to the game, no real characters, no story, and no explanation even when you win. Similar to a game like The Stanley Parable, Antichamber forces you to draw your own conclusions. Is it just a cool game, or is there symbolism to be found and suggested meanings? It's up to the player to decide whether or not to try and delve deeper or not. Open-ended experiences always tickle my fancy.\n\n","May 20","true","7.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Think again.  Assume a corridor will still take you to the same place if you walk down it facing backwards?  Think again.  Assume if you walk around a corner and then walk back around the same corner that you'll end up in the same place you started from?  Think again.\n\nEvery time you get stuck in Antichamber it's either because you have an unspoken assumption about the way 3D games work.  Inspect your assumptions and work out which assumption to discard, and suddenly the whole game opens up again as what seemed like an intractable problem is solved by an action that - in retrospect - now seems as simple as "turn left" or "walk backwards"... but which you were never even aware was an option before.\n\nIf you like your assumptions unchallenged, this is not the game for you.  If you want your intuitions about 3D spatial navigation violently rearranged in the same way as Portal did your understanding of physics and mechanics, this might be the game for you.

It is NOT.\n\nIn summary, you draw cubes from rooms and you can lay them in another point of the room to solve a puzzle e.g. building a stair climb up a ledge or placing it in a socket to close/open a door. Doesn't sound much interesting, but the chambers take place in some sort of mind-bending reality, playing with your perspective: rooms look like something else depending from where you are looking... Its hard to explain without spoiling the exploration feeling, I'm doing my best here! Expect many WTH moments.\n\nPuzzles are usually not trivial, some are even quite challenging, and the mind-bending mechanic is rarely used to impose "fake" difficulty (that is, the puzzles follow a logic that you can as well follow). Some chambers require some dexterity.\n\nI have two critiques about the game:\n- No achievements... c'mon...\n- Some of the puzzles are initially presented in a point in which you just cannot solve them.

No matter the price, if you haven't played this game you must play this game.\n\nQuick *spoilerish* review here, expanded *nonspoiler* review below. It is a simplistically drawn puzzle game that makes You the biggest obstacle. Rooms often disappear and floors sometimes appear where there were none. Everything you come across will twist your brain. You walk around trying to solve puzzles in order to move on, but there is no set order you have to go in; two people will likely progress in two completely different ways. You start the game without instruction and have to figure things out as you go, almost entirely by experimentation. There are some areas that require extra equipment that you find later on, and hitting those roadblocks early is sometimes quite frustrating but they will make sense once you come back to them later. There is a central mechanic that allows you to revisit any area you've been to before, which is nice if you want to put certain puzzles on hold and try them again later. Sometimes the game makes you feel so frustrated you want to give up, and other times it is addictive to the point where you won't let yourself stop. There are also cute little placards that give quips summarizing whatever task you've just completed, which in their entirety tell a story all their own. In this game there is a lot of trying, a LOT of failing (even though there is no real way to fail the game--you can always go somewhere else), and the biggest sense of accomplishment you might ever feel in any video game.\n\nWalk around, solve brain-scrambling puzzles, get frustrated, try again, ????, profit.\n9.8 / 10, absolutely must must Must buy.\n\n\nAnd now, a slightly more eloquent, *spoiler-free* review:\nThe user reviews are Overwhelmingly Positive for a reason. Rather, for lots of reasons. This game is unlike anything I'd tried before. It is a puzzle game in the sense that the game itself is a puzzle: you have to figure out how the game works as you go along. And the rules keep changing.\n\nThe in-game puzzles themselves are often difficult but it's mostly due to the limitations you've set up within your own mind. You have to unlearn a lot of what other games have established as how FPS-style games are "supposed" to work. In certain ways, it might be easier for many non-gamers because, as my mother (who had never played a videogame before, and whom I forced to play this, yes) explained after handily solving several of the puzzles, "I didn't know you couldn't do that."\n\nYou can't take anything as granted. This game takes well-established tropes and warps some and downright breaks the rest. To fully succeed, you have to unlearn a lot of normal video game mechanics.. often things as simple as if-I-walk-out-of-a-room-and-turn-around-I-expect-it-to-still-be-the-same-room-I-walked-out-of. Yeah. Nope. This game makes you twist your mind inside out in order to solve some of the puzzles. Often the game was hard simply because my brain couldn't think sideways enough for it. It messes with your mind so much MC Escher would get dizzy. Please know that I relish a good mind messing, and Antichamber takes the cake.\n\nA nice part of the game is that there is never a time when you "fail" a puzzle. There is no "You Lose" scenario. Everything you do, even if it isn't what you intended on doing, will lead you somewhere. The puzzles have definite solutions, but you can't do anything "wrong" in the game. Not in the sense that you lose and have to start over. It all builds on itself. The game also does a very good job of subtly teaching you skills you can use later for more complex puzzles. Even though it is a brain-melting puzzle game, in a sense you are eased into things. There is never an unsolvable puzzle, you just might not have learned what to do yet. However, this game requires you to think so far outside the box that you end up thinking outside the other box that the first box was sitting in. It isn't just a sitdown, jigsaw puzzle, you-know-what-to-do-but-you-just-have-to-figure-out-how-to-do-it type puzzle game, it is also a learning-new-things-as-you-go type puzzle game. I loved (almost.. grr) every second of it.\n\nExcept maybe for Portal --and it's a close race-- there is no game I would more fervently recommend than Antichamber. That blue thumbs up isn't big enough for how strongly I recommend it.\n\nIf nothing else, the title is a pun.","October 2, 2015","true","22.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

Or perhaps, they are inspired by those philosophical axioms, then acquire an obscure sense of life atittude.\n\nGaming experience is incredibly good. Players will feel a great sence of achievement after beating every puzzles. Yes, puzzles are so well-designed that I regard them as arts. To beat them requires players to be good observants--in game, nothing is trivil, every single things maybe extremely helpful. Besides, players need to understand and master the function of different guns, and try to combine them, which make puzzles more challenging--but I reckon this is exactly what you want, isn't it?\n\nBut I have to say, Antichamber has a unique arts style which is attractive for some people, but it may be too overwhelming to others. It is not hard to find intensive color clash in game, sometimes it may cause uncomfortableness or nausea.

There are many types of simluation games, and this one does very well at simulating the process of being on drugs.\n\nFor the most part, Antichamber is a very simple game. You walk into walls to get guns so you can turn the black box man into an optical illusion. You can also click on pictures of bears and children that give hints along the way.\n\nIf you want a challenge of a game, this is the game for you as it tests your ability to stay sane while it spits weed out of your computer that you unintentionally smoke during the game. This likely explains why I feel different after playing an hour or two of this game.\n\nAll of the puzzles in this game are actually much more logical than they may seem, though you only find this out after you FINISH the puzzle and click on the hint duck pictures. Assuming you are NOT on drugs and can in fact read, I recommend you read the hints and take them into consideration. The signs never lie, just like people on the internet.\n\nIf I had to rate this game, I would probably give it a 400.20/420. There wasn't really a story at all, I guess is why that is. Otherwise I'd give it a full blazed 420/420. The art style is so simple yet fantastic, the puzzles are much more difficult than I was prepared for, and there were so many moments that I went "OH that was SO satisying to finish!" though I may have been saying that about the weed that kept coming out of my computer.

Escher is, search his work up. You've probably seen one or two of his pieces before and never realized it. If you already know and love Escher, then you will not only appreciate Antichamber's look, but you will likely enjoy playing it.\n\nFirst of all, this game is not easily comparable to Portal. They have similar aesthetics; you are in first person, you are some voiceless being, and you simply interact with the very concrete world around you to solve puzzles as they arrive, until everything you've come across is no longer a mystery. The similarities stop there. Portal is linear; it has humor, it has lore, it makes you feel your situation like you are a character in a world with the odds against you, and it pushes you forward through each puzzle with just enough to solve it and move on.\n\nAntichamber, in this aspect, is the exact opposite. You will not feel like someone else, like someone installed into the lore, or like a character who needs to escape from their situation. You will start with absolutely no clue what you're doing or what you can do, and you will come across each challenge using only a portion of it, and then have to return to a room later just to suddenly realize what everything was supposed to do all along. All the pieces of the puzzle will click together. Then you move forward.\n\nEvery single room in this game is available to you at all times. It's not linear, not at all. If you run into a dead end, you press your Escape key, return to the start of that room and try to figure out what you did wrong previously, or jump somewhere completely different all the way across the map and find out what you can now do that you never used to be able to. However; things are still connected. There's nothing meaningless. You'll have to fail a lot in order to succeed in the end.\n\nI've addressed these specific things about Antichamber because the majority of the complaints in the Negative reviews section seems to be built on the idea that these are bad things. Tedious trial-and-error, statements trying too hard to sound wise, a lack of any direction to what needs to be solved next. Are they bad things? Do they go against the definition of a puzzle game? No. Those kinds of things are purely subjective. In this review I am not telling you to buy this game. I'm not going to try to convince absolutely everyone that this game will be in their taste. I have told you what Antichamber is.\n\nThe only honest reviews you read from the Negative section about Antichamber will be the ones that say "This game is not my cup of tea."","September 22, 2014","true","16.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

What about it?\n\nIs it a good game?\nWell, we can get to that in a minute, but don't you want to ask me some more specific questions first?\n\nUm, okay. How about you start out by telling us what it is.\nWell, the title lies. It's not Antichamber. It's (lots of)Antichamber(s). Lots and lots of antichambers.\nIt's a game set in a highly linear, and highly surreal maze. In order to proceed through the area, you must solve physical puzzles. Sometimes based on resource management, sometimes based on clue decifering, and sometimes just based on trial and error, the puzzes often prove to be challenging. Ususally when I finish playing Antichamber my brain is sore.\n\nOkay. So now that we know what it is, how would you rate the gameplay?\nThe best word to describe it is unique.\nThere are plenty of other first person physical puzzle games, such as Portal or the Talos Principle, but this one stands as a completely different game.\nThe world is very surreal. There are parts where you fall through the floor when you look down. Where a room changes depending on where you're looking from. Where a hallway changes if you walk backwards rather than forwards.\nAnd I love the unpredictability of it. There's no experience like it.\n\nWhy don't you describe the visuals to us.\nSure.\nTo match the surreality of the environment, the graphics are simple, yet abstract. They fall into the same category as the gameplay: unique.\nColors are bold, and the visual contrast between different materials in the game make it easier for one to distinguish key items that are vital in the solving of puzzIes.\nThey're also high resolution. *oooooooo, high resolutionnnn*\n\nDo you find yourself wanting to come back and re-do the puzzles?\nI think you're asking about replay value. If so, I wouldn't say it has a lot of it.\nGranted, though, Antichamber is a puzzle game, and as the puzzles can only be solved in one way, there really isn't any point of returning to replay the game. Unless you just freaking love it.\nHowever, it must be remembered that few puzzle games do have very much replay value, due to their linearity.\n\nWhat about the cost? Is it worth the $20?\nI don't want to say this, but I need to. It really isn't worth $20.\nI actually got it for less than half price, as I traded for it. I would say it's worth at least it's sale price ($5), but not the full price. But that's just my opinion.\n\nAlright alright alright. Looks like we're just about done. What are your overall thoughts?\nI would say that overall Antichamber is a great game.\nIt's creative, innovative, unique, and it's exactly what the puzzle genre needed.\nIt's worth your time. See if you can get it on sale.\nFor puzzle fans, this is a must have. No, an essential... ugh  JUST BUY IT OKAY .\n\nHave fun.\n\n~ caleb4est","July 19, 2015","true","2.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

It will force you to think outside the box. And that is not an easy task for most of us.\n\nThe game itself consists of a mostly seamless world (until you get to a part where you're being forced to teleport out of it), with puzzles in every corner. Not all of these puzzles have to be finished for you to complete the game, but you do have to collect the 4 different guns in order to advance and finish the game. Once again, not an easy task.\n\nI'd love to explain some of these puzzles to you but that would spoil them and it's too difficult to even try anyway. It's something you have to experience, if only for a short while.\n\nAntichamber has another cool feature; the use of in-game achievements. The rooms use icons/pictures and text to act as in-game achievements. Seeing them lets you know if you've been there before and it might even give you a subtle hint on what to do. You'll have to solve every puzzle there is so fill up your wall.\nIt would've been nice if there were Steam achievements involved as well, but hey, you can't have everything I guess.\n\nOne annoying thing is that if you press Escape you have to start over if you wish to continue the puzzle you were working on. There's no pause button, if you press Esc you're back in the 'main menu' where you can select which puzzle you want to solve and see your achievements. Quite annoying if you want to take a little break.\n\nOh, as you may have noticed the graphics are a mix of simplistic, artistic and futurustic styles, and while they're not always hi def, they're cool to look at. It's really something special.\n\nHmm, I don't know what to say to you. I wish I could recommend this game to anyone out there, but I think it's a 'love it or hate it' game. As a game though, it's a success !\n\n[Rating: 77/100]","February 16, 2013","true","7.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Lox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/weird_vector/","209 products in account","If you liked Portal and wanted to play something else like that you're in tough position. There's simply not many things like that. Then there's Antichamber. It can't really be compared to Portal as it's a completely different kind of game apart from being a first-person puzzle game, but if you enjoyed "thinking with portals" you should check it out.\n\nFirst thing you see on the promotional materials and after starting the game is the incredibly simplistic and sterile art direction. Accompanied by subtle and fitting soundtrack, it sets the tone for the whole game and dramatically helps it being what it is. Antichamber simply wouldn't work with more realistic approach to graphics.\n\nAs for the game's mind-bending properties - they're there, but mostly in the first part of the game. New game mechanics introduced to the player along the way are not particularly special or interesting although not bad either - what's bad is their use. It comes down mostly to solving yet another puzzle embodied in the wall in order to open yet another door. It's rather disappointing and makes the game not use most of its potential.\n\nStory-wise, there's literally nothing to guide you. Not a single word of explanation who you are, where are you, what are you trying to do etc. You have to think for yourself. And it works. I really liked how it's all very ambiguous yet not pretentious, and this approach fits the game perfectly. Plus the ending is very cool. It kind of saved the overall experience for me as I was getting more and more tired and disappointed in the middle section of the game.\n\nIn overall I really think this is a game worth playing. It has its flaws - mostly poor use of mechanics and repetitiveness at some points, which is a pretty major thing - but makes up for it in other aspects. There's not enough of games of this kind to miss this one.","February 21, 2014","true","6.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FatIibrarian/recommended/219890/","FatIibrarian","Moira Aetherpom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FatIibrarian/","537 products in account","----A 3D Real Engine ran puzzler, that left me short of words at the end. An indie game I passed by and played a couple years after its release, that has some pretty clever puzzles, from the simple movement of blocks, to the outright mass replication of the same few blocks to (in my case) an entire floor of the same block set you started with. Mind you I missed some puzzles more than likely, and the mystery of the pink roaming block is yet to be cleared as of this review, but what I did from a standard start-to-finish playthrough of this gem, I can safely say theres plenty to do that I've yet to see myself. You get pretty much thrown into the world, with no real spoken start, just signs that can be used as proverbs for life, or big hints for the games. Even the silly little cartoon drawings in them made me chuckle from time to time, while others made me reflect on life.\n\n----The controls itself, were pretty direct, and the menu was thrown into the nexus room, not saying that it was a messy move, mind you, it in fact was quite the opposite. The Esc menu itself was actually something you returned to often, whether you wanted to or not. It in of itself, was a nexus that almost acted like a brick wall, but at the same time, an indicator for where you are in progress. Sensitive and precise, you can easily snag a block from across the room and place it elsewhere, which it requires you to do exactly that in some puzzles. Even when you gain new abilities though a differently colored "Matter Gun" (as I like to call it), it gives you a lesson on the basics, and leaves you to notice the rest on your own. The controls are quite simple and limited to your three mouse buttons (left and right click, and mouse wheel click) and the standard WASD to move. Those familiar with FPS games in terms of controls, won't feel too alien to the game, at the same time, anyone can just simply pick it up.\n\n----The gameplay, is puzzles, puzzles puzzles puzzles. Not that its bad as well, in fact its quite nice, since the puzzles aren't simple after a while, and involve some true out-of-the-box thinking. I can't say too much about the puzzles without spoiling too much, but your worse enemy is your eyes. Theres also no bugs that I've found, only the occasional graphics flicker in very miniscule zones, which is very ignorable, and likely due to my GPU. Also your ESC menu is a damn room with a map to warp from place to place on. So the puzzles won't be so draggish if you have to repeat them for some form of progress.\n\n----The music is sort of there, not that I'm complaining about its subtlty, since its all atmospheric sounds and music. From a meadow to a swamp, you pretty much get placed in a rather clear state of mind, and in my opinion, a good clear mind for some of these puzzles.\n\n----The graphics are simple, and yet clever in reason. Even the graphics will make you wonder if its part of the solution. Hint hint.\n\n----The difficulty is wholy dependent on you, this could be the easiest game you will ever play, or the hardest one you will even attempt. With the game throwing you for loops, sending you into "Dead-ends" or just outright dumping you somewhere else entirely, new or familiar. Things change around you, causing you to miss things, or notice them outright. It keeps you on your toes, and tries to fool you into thinking some parts are pointless, while others may get you somewhere.\n\n----All in all, the game is a fantastic grab, even if I got it on Humble bundle, and did this review after it was done and over. Its still worth a purchase and some time. Though personally, for the purest experience, don't use any guides, considering it can easily reduce the effect of the game. I don't want to review this game on a numbered scale, because that stuff is so askewed lately for game reviews, so if you're into puzzle games, or just into something to sink your time into between breaks of other games, hell even just to play it, I say its highly recommended.","March 23, 2014","true","9.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Now there's a sentence that doesn't apply to most games.\n\nThe visuals are very simple; the hallways are mostly white, with only black lines to indicate where corners are. Colors are very important in this game; they can help you orient yourself as the world changes around you (did I mention that you can be walking down a hallway, get to the end, turn around, and see a completely different hallway behind you?). The color of your gun also determines what its powers are. There are several sections of the game, each requiring a different gun to solve its puzzles.\n\nSpeaking of puzzles, they are a doozy. Because the game does not rely on traditional notions of geometry, they can really do whatever they want. I don't want to spoil any of the puzzles, but don't feel discouraged if you can't solve one the first time you try. Sometimes there is a tool or technique that you have to get in a different chamber first. And even if you get completely stuck, you can just hit Esc at any time and go to the Antichamber.\n\nThe antichamber serves as a main menu. The game's options and controls are all plastered over one wall, a map of all of the chambers you have been to (you can travel to any one of them from the antichamber) a view of what claims to be the exit, and a big chalkboard of the lessons you have learned.\n\nThose lessons are my favorite thing about the game. They are often placed just before or after a puzzle, and they contain a life lesson that pertains to that particular puzzle.\n\nI've played about three hours of the game, and I have discovered two different colors of the gun, and I think there are two more. I'm kind of stuck though, and I might have to bite the bullet and look at some walkthroughs.\n\nI would say that a reasonable price for this game is $10, so you should definitely wait until it is on sale to pick it up.","September 8, 2013","true","3.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This is something unusual, that's for sure.\n\nA lot of things are not as they seem. Entering a door might lead you back to where you were. Walls may not be walls and air might turn into floors. Right off the bat you are tricked completely. That's the fun bit about this game. There are some clues spread about, but you really have to be willing to think unconventionally if you're going to get anywhere. It really had me intrigued.\n\nEventually you are given a gun of various types. These let you place and manipulate cubes. This is necessary to solve most of the puzzles. It makes a new twist on things, and for every new type of gun, you get a-ha moments and can solve puzzles you previously struggled with.\n\nThere are a lot of puzzles to solve, however, eventually they actually become rather easy, and can be solved in different ways. It might just be that you get used to thinking differently, but the curiosity you had in the very beginning loses momentum as you get deeper in the game. Sometimes you'll just get stuck too, and that was a bit deterring. I had to cheat some times.\n\nThere's very little information on what your purpose is. Don't get me wrong, there doesn't have to be a narrative, however, the game gives you a map, but it doesn't tell you how to read it. I learned how, just a short while before I managed to finish the game. Had I known sooner, perhaps I wouldn't have gotten stuck so often.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a soundtrack, sadly, and the sound volume is rather low. The visual style is really cool and different, if not a bit "glitchy" at times. The ending was surprising, but honestly a little disappointing.\n\nThis isn't Portal. It's not quite like any other game out there. I can't say that about many games these days. It's refreshing. I guess it has some similarities with Stanley's Parable, except there's not a lot of humor. If you like puzzle games I can easily recommend it.

In order to overcome all of the self-constructing walls, false passages, and invisible portals of the labyrinth, the player must indeed take a few steps backwards, by abandoning his or her sense of spatial reasoning.\n\nBesides the dead-ends and regressions, there are no enemies in Antichamber, and the only shooting comes in the form of an upgradable, cube-shooting device. Developer Alexander Bruce proves himself a master of extra-dimensional gameplay, creating challenges that push the player further and further beyond the comforts of conventional physics. He also preys on a few gaming conventions, from a tutorial which must be disobeyed in order to advance, to rooms which are best navigated by walking through them backward. One of Bruce's more frequent tricks is to make many divergent paths lead to the same destination, rendering the player's choices irrelevant. To avoid covering the same ground under the illusion of forward progress, the player must move slowly and be perceptive.\n\nThanks to some incredibly polished audio and visuals, it is quite enjoyable to move slowly. Crisp sounds and rich colors create an other-worldly atmosphere, completed by Siddhartha Barnhoorn's ambient compositions, which feature digitally-manipulated recordings of Japanese instruments. The graphics are functional as well as beautiful, with correct paths often presenting themselves in recurring shapes, colors and sprites. Responsive control guarantees that you'll get around easily, even when building cube stairways or leaping across chasms.\n\nThe average player should be able to complete the game in ten to twelve hours (although experienced gamers, Bruce claims, will have a harder time with certain challenges that were designed to counter traditional first-person tactics). Ten hours might be a little more bewilderment than some can handle, and the second half of the game, with its emphasis on cube manipulation, can get particularly dizzying. If you are prone to existential nausea, I would recommend this game in small doses.\n\nWhat makes Antichamber so absorbing-- and in my opinion, important-- is that it allows us to experience impossible geometry. In Bruce's words: “Things that are completely incomprehensible by looking at mathematical formulas on paper, like quantum mechanics or non-Euclidean space, [are] presented in a way that allows the player to interact with them more directly and understand their ramifications.” In the real world, we will never experience a closed loop with an exit point, or a single door that opens onto an unlimited number of rooms. We will never take a step that moves us in more than one direction, or jump down a chute to find higher ground. Antichamber gives us these mind-altering opportunities.\n\nTL;DR -- An immersive and puzzling, three-dimensional exhibition of four-dimensional space.\n","December 15, 2013","true","7.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Haven't enjoyed a puzzle game as much since Portal 2 and the Talos Principle.\n\nThe game does not hold your hand quite as much as the above, however. There are some "learning puzzles" and hints, but some of the basic mechanics and moves are left for you to discover. I came across some while fooling around rather randomly, and this can be a source of additional excitement or frustration, depending on how long it takes to discover. If you are stuck, it probably means you have missed something about the mechanics.\n\nOn the other hand there are several paths possible which is great since if you are stuck you can simply switch to another puzzle room and avoid getting too frustrated, possibly coming back to it later with a fresher mind or improved knowledge of the mechanics.\n\nOnly real downside is that is is fairly short, I finished my first playthorugh in 12 h, so you may want to wait for a sale.","April 11","true","14.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Seeing that the rabbit hole goes still further when I thought there couldn't be any more. I am impressed at the scope and the style. Some things could have been slightly better signposted but figuring out some of the mechanics even exist as a possibility is a real treat when you pull it off for yourself. Hopefully you are quite good at navigating, as those skills will pay off almost as well as knowing for puzzles. If there is an easy puzzle and a hard puzzle, do the easy one first. Follow that path, and by the time you get back to that spot you will have likely revealed what you need to do for the harder bit. Sometimes it will take ability upgrades that enable more. Better to keep yourself moving as the game is not well suited to keeping a pace, often happy to let you bounce off walls.\n\nMore than spoilers on the puzzles, more than any sort of plot hook, the real thing to manage to not spoil this game is your expectations. The puzzles aren't always ideal. There can definitely be parts where you know how to do it and just make a bad play of it and need to start the area again. Some bits are repetitive even without that. Navigating is more of a challenge than I might otherwise excuse. The mechanics are often obtuse needing you to just get lucky to discover. For me though, what may be frustration at other times has more often been pure triumphant joy. 5/5","May 22","true","18.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

The less you know about Antichamber going in the more likely you’ll enjoy your stay, so I advise against learning more than is necessary to pique your interest.\n\nThe game throws you into a bleak world with physical laws of its own, no tutorial and no clear goal besides a glimpse of a door labeled EXIT.  The labyrinth is mostly comprised of sterile white rooms and corridors peppered with bursts of color, which usually indicate a puzzle or test.   While these are clearly distinguishable from one another, somehow the lines between them quickly begin to blur and cause some confusion as to what you’re actually accomplishing or what is required to progress.  As a result the experience is, at times, a disconnected mess of warping back to the interactive map in the starting room to reset an area or avoid repeating a puzzle for the tenth time.\n\nIn spite of this, Antichamber is fun and certainly an original concept—one I’ll gladly never forget—even if it's not as much of a peek into the human psyche as I'd hoped; progression ends up being bottlenecked more by traditional elements of game design than the human mind.\n\nMany areas in Antichamber initially seem exciting to work through but are ultimately unrewarding, some feel completely unfinished and, even if patched, it’s too late for those who have already endured the experiments. The game is still a must play in my opinion, and I look forward to the developer’s next project, even if the odds are stacked against it being remotely as original as Antichamber.","April 16, 2013","true","10.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","3"

Escher designed it. The similarities to Portal are obvious: Antichamber is a first-person puzzle-platform game in which a key tool to solving the levels is a kind of gun for manipulating the world. But those similarities are big structural elements, as far as the actual experience of gameplay and the nature of the puzzles Antichamber is unique, and well worth attention in its own right.\n\nAntichamber is very abstract; it essentially omits characters and plot altogether. As a player, you are not even told who you are. Instead, you simply find yourself in a world of stark geometric forms from which you are seeking an escape. The system of interconnected rooms and corridors you find yourself in is essentially one big level, without any marked division into stages. But as you discover solution to various puzzles, and gain new tools, more and more areas will become accessible to you. To help with disorientation you may return at any time to a kind of antechamber which provides a map of your progress and also doubles as the game’s only menu.\n\nAll this sounds rather stark, but the real delight of antechamber is its hard-edged surreality. This is where Escher comes into it. Instead of trying, like most 3D games, to give you the impression that you are in a real, physical space, Antichamber revels in the fact that you aren’t. Instead you are in a world where the geometrically impossible is actual: staircases deposit your back where you started, hallways connect to different places depending on how you use them, doors change where they open to when you turn your back. Relatedly, the game eschews realistic-looking textures for vivid monochrome, including a lot of white.\n\nThe puzzles also defy expectations. If you’ve played a lot of puzzle games you’ll notice this right away. Unlike many games which tell you what sort of solution you’re looking for and give you a series of puzzles on a common theme, Antichamber leaves you to figure it out for yourself—to wander around and play with the world until you have insight. Some puzzles are of a type players of puzzle platformers will more or less recognize, but others require an entirely different approach, more like lateral thinking. This makes each breakthrough feel like a flash of brilliance. Enigmatic little clues are found on the walls at intervals, some to help you have the needed insight, others just to provide general good advice.\n\nAll this to say, Antichamber is a great game for the puzzle aficionado, provided she is somewhat patient. Solving this game was really engaging and satisfying. Even after accomplishing your main objective various rooms will, likely, still have something hidden in them. But, also, Antichamber gives you the fun of simply exploring. The place you find yourself is not conventionally beautiful, but it is fascinating, and much has been included simply to fascinate. Among other things, there are several hidden rooms in antechamber which preserve artifacts from its development, and others where it seems the level designers are simply showing off what they can do with the faux physics of their world. Antichamber provides you with a digital artifact worth simply looking at.\n\nThere are a few downsides to this. That you are not restricted to working on a single, clearly delineated problem is both a blessing and a curse. Being dropped into this labyrinth without much direction, unsure where to even start looking for solutions, can seem daunting. There were points in my first play through where I had to just put the game down to come back to later, and others where I spent a lot of time on challenges that turned out not to really advance me (for instance because I’d been trying to access a point which was meant to be easily reachable much later in the game). Also, this would be a poor choice for somebody not already familiar with this sort of videogame. This is a puzzle game for gamers.\n\nBut, overall, I’d rate this as one of the very best puzzle platformers I’ve played, in a category with things like Braid and Portal. It is well worth a look.","July 23, 2015","true","20.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Overall, it's a great buy for anyone that wants to try something different and insightful or is just looking for a mental challenge.\n\nFrom r/gaming 6 months after I wrote this: http://www.livememe.com/9mjb40x","July 15, 2013","true","10.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","8"

This game has some major issues like, how do i get people to shoot, and how to get a real gun not some stupid block placer thing. The problem is that this game just isn't as good as it's predecessor, namely Marvel Vs. Capcom 2. In that game i could shoot all the bad guys i want, but in this one I am supposed to think with my brain to do a riddle? I really think Square Enix missed the mark on this one, it doesn't even have fan favorite character Blanka, who everyone loved when he first appeared in Final Fantasy 7 eating mud in the Lindblum dump.

I would highly, highly recommend this game. At first glance a lot of the puzzles appear to be cheep tricks but they grow to be rather fun and most importantly, intellectually stimulating (what puzzle games are supposed to do).\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of this game is that the puzzles can be solved in a plethora of ways. Where as in most puzzle games, each puzzle only has one solution: the developers intended solution. Which may be quite obscure and therefore difficult to disconcern (which DOES NOT make for a good puzzle game).\n\nHere however, there are many ways to solve a puzzle here and the skills you learn along the way are being constantly tested and reapplied in a perfect balance that neither sees intense reptition (of practicing skills) nore far reaches (i.e. learning algebra I then being expecting to jump straight into calculus).\n\nFuthermore, theres a very limited factor of aggravation- most puzzle games like to have a few puzzles that require you to do something very precise within a very limited window and when you fail, require you do to the whole puzzle over again. While there is SOME of that here, the amount that you have to redo is significantly shorter than most other puzzle games (as youll see when you learn to properly wield the transport system).\n\n\n\nMy ONLY complaint about this game is that you need a pair of sunglasses to play it, really guys, turn down the brightness which you cannot do in game. The options you can configure in game are quite limited (mostly resolution), you have to go into the config files to manually rebind keys and lower the intense brightness (EVERYTHING is vibrant, VIBRANT colors, usually pure white).\n\nWhile not being stone set linear like most puzzle games, there are multiple paths to take especially if you cannot figure out a particular puzzle, but ultimately you have to have completed a central goal (the weapon portrayed in some of the SS's) to progress on to additional paths. So its not entirely free lance- carve your own path but, its close. As such It has very limited replayability, especially as most of the puzzles revolve around learning a central key hidden method (quite satisfying when you find them on your own).\n\n\nNow its not the mind f*** that all the reviewers claim it to be. However its very fun to explore, and can be sort hard to follow spacially, but you'll get it rather quick off the bat.\n\nI *HIGHLY* recommend this for puzzle game lovers.","September 21, 2013","true","7.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's not about acquiring an upgrade and remembering where that purple door you previously couldn't open was. It's about acquiring an upgrade, acquiring a new way of thinking, and THEN progressing. And the feeling of satisfaction you get when you solve this game's completely unique puzzles, when you figure out the mechanics behind this alien world; that feeling of not just exploring, but understanding - that feeling is really, really great.\nAlso, while the game may not exactly look nice on screenshots, it knows how to create amazing and atmospheric moments with it's seemingly primitive building blocks. The final area of the game literally made my jaw drop.\n\nAntichamber is the most unique Metroidvania you will ever have the privilege of playing.

It takes all you believe to know about how puzzle games work, and turns it upside-down. There will be a lot of moments when you are so confused that you will need to take a break from the game, just to suddenly notice the solution to a puzzle come up in your mind without you even thinking about it.\n\nThe game is logical, yet messes with your logic in a way that will leave you in awe, slowly realizing the scale of the entire thing.\n\nAs you progress, you will unlock more and more powerful tools, allowing you to solve more complex puzzles, but also backtrack and find alternate paths and solutions to previous puzzles. But only a portion of these tools will be actual in-game upgrades, while the rest is simply knowledge you gain while solving the puzzles. Seriously, this game can be beaten in about 20 minutes, but it took me more than 10 hours, and might take you even longer, because I had some puzzles spoiled for me.\n\nOh, and regarding spoilers: Don't watch any videos, except for the trailer on the Steam store page. Every bit of every video might possibly spoil something so important it can cut your game time in half and leave you wishing you never found out about it.\n\nTo decide if you want the game, ask yourself the following:\nDoes the trailer look interesting, even if it's just a tiny bit?\nAre you fine with the game's visual style? (personally, I love it, it's simplistic and effective, but some people seem to be feeling nauseous after playing the game for a bit, so you might want to watch out for that... again, the trailer should be enough to figure that out)\nAre you interested in puzzle games?\n\nIf you answered yes to those questions, definitely get the game.","December 24, 2013","true","9.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Beyond that, every other step is a chance to trip over some spacial awareness wrecking passage or infinitely looping hallway. Depending on how lost you get yourself, this might account for half your playtime before getting to the actual puzzle part of the game.\nThere is more to the game than just wandering lost in a building that's actively trying to get you more lost, and when you reach the point where you're intended to start solving puzzles, Antichamber does finally start to get some cohesion going on, so it's not just a "walking around lost and confused" simulation.\nMy biggest complaint (SPOILERS) is that there's no explanation for what's happening in the game, right up to the end. Not that there's anything wrong with making a game with no story; but Antichamber has the trappings and suggestions that there's something bigger going on, but there's nothing concrete.\nAside from all that, some of the late game puzzles can be pretty dense and difficult to figure out, and the visual motif with the outlines and primary colors can get kind of obnoxious when the game demands that you jump across giant holes in the ground.\nNone of these complaints are enough to keep me from issuing a reccomendation, however, since it's still a very rare example of an artsy game that doesn't feel like the video game equivilent of a coffee house art snob, scoffing at all the "normal" games for not being deep enough. Antichamber is good right at face value, on its own merits and for its own reasons.

This game makes you make mistakes so you can learn and go forward, puzzles are a binary; right and wrong.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this game and I hope more people play it.","January 3, 2015","true","9.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In attempting to chase this fabled quality, videogames have usually attempted two things in tandem. To obtain better graphics, and to be realistic.\n\nAntichamber is without a doubt one of the most immersive games i have ever played. Yet it defies these two so-called requirements. It is visually striking without advanced graphical technology, and it is enthrallingly, lovingly absorbing while fully embracing its nature as a virtual environment where the laws of physics need not be obeyed.\n\nPartly it owes this immersive nature to its simple design. Its stark colours and environments that follow their own aesthetics. Partly it owes this to its tremendous audio work. But mostly it owes this i feel to the underlying theme of unreality that it embraces.\n\nBy embracing, not shunning, the fact that it is not real, Antichamber becomes more immersive than any other game i can think of. It simply immerses you into a world of unreality which is not your own - and the fact that more videogames dont do this is to their fault.\n\nI feel Antichamber is a little glimpse into the future. Of what artificial and virtual environments will really be like. To play is to be drawn into a world where space is nothing but an illusion, and you must get used to this to function within it. To walk down a hallway only to discover when you turn around that behind you is now a door to a new area, to discover entire rooms hidden inside a two dimensional image, to have window panes you can look through only to discover that in doing so you were transported into the area you were peering into.\n\nAs you delve into its world, the beautiful sounds, calming words and general serenity of its environment ease you into this new way of thinking, this new domain of non-euclidean geometry. And it is to the games credit to say that to leave Antichamber - because real life comes calling, or because a puzzle has temporarily defeated you - feels distinctly wrong. Like spending so much time on a trampoline that walking on solid earth makes you question your steps. Because Antichamber opens your mind to what can be done when you realise that a piece of space can be reused as many times as you wish. To snap back to reality is to realize how limiting physics truly is. You walk your home imagining how much better it would be if this was there, and that was here. How much easier it would be if space would only agree to bend in such a way that better things were possible.\n\nMost puzzles in the game are incredibly, viciously easy. You simply will not find them easy, you will find them brain-wracking, because that clever mind of yours was designed for a space which follows rules that are as easily ignored as anything could be.\n\nOverall, i would greatly recommend Antichamber. If any game deserves the 'games are art' badge, it is one that both shows how incredibly novel videogames can be, and gives us a glimpse into the virtual worlds our descendants will be exploring.","January 21, 2015","true","7.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is no actual story nor narration, only pictures and proverbs suitable for every puzzle solved, yet somehow there is a feeling that you are being guided and all puzzles are leading you to a very certain goal\n• Graphics are as basic as you can get, everything is made of cubes, amount of polygons is minimal, and there are little to no textures, yet somehow everything is gorgeous and pleasant to look at\n• Puzzles are inventive, innovative and unique, but all of them has logical solution. It's far from impossible, yet you WILL have to change the way you think more that several times throughout the game. Last (and only) time I was so impressed with game puzzles is when I played Braid.\n• Game mechanics is just like everything else in this game - simple and awesome. Whole experience reminds of a lot Portal, but not as linear, you actually have several paths to choose from and there are lots of puzzles you can find if you explore the map.\nWhat I love the most about mechanics is that you are free to experiment with the game physics and features. Personally I'm not sure if I solved some of the puzzles correct way, it sometimes feel as if I found a workaround that wasn't intended by developers. Which is an awesome feeling for me.\n\nSo hell yeah, I recommend this game. It's a MUST for every puzzle lover.\n\n\n\n","April 1, 2015","true","6.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's art in it's most purest form. It's about learning to think in non-linear paths, about approaching situations in different ways and memorizing and advancing in ways you're not used to. In more ways than one, this game is absolute madness, playing tricks with positioning that no sane mind would be able to memorize.\nHowever, in that process, it does offer a whole array of puzzles that make you feel good once you figure them out (okay...most of 'em. There are one or two really frustrating amongst them). The pictures and text feel better than all superfluous "achievement unlocked"'s combined.\n\nThe aesthetics may take some getting used to. It's all white, white and more white, but it grows on you. Coupled with the soft music, it really puts your mind at ease.\n\nAt first, I thought the whole game would be about brain puzzles. And while that was true, the block gun (and variants) do a good job of spicing things up without sacrificing neither the puzzle element nor the atmosphere.\n\nI normally take the time to point out some the game's flaws, but in this case it would be a shame. Yes, some puzzles are frustrating, but is it because they ARE frustrating or because it requires the sort of thinking I personally am not accustomed to? It's probably the latter. And I really can't bring myself to criticizing the confusing structure of the whole, as it's that very structure that I come to adore. I mean...how many other games do you know where there's a 7-floor tower, complete with a sort-of-elevator shaft in the middle...where those seven floors are rooms that are located directly next to each other?\n\nI just finished it for the second time (first time being a few years ago). As expected, I had sort of forgotten the harder puzzles, making it all the more challenging. And I'll probably replay it again in a few years from now. For puzzle games, that's a pretty unique feat. Take it for what it's worth. If there was a contest for best puzzle game ever, I'd not only nominate this, but criticise everyone who doesn't at least considers it.\n\nIn summary: best puzzle game ever. And I don't throw these nominations around lightly. ABSOLUTELY recommended.","March 9, 2015","true","14.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/terrorbite/recommended/219890/","terrorbite","TerrorBite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/terrorbite/","211 products in account","Antichamber is a psychological puzzle game which will blow your mind. Splashes of psychedelic color punctuate an otherwise monochrome, cel-shaded world of ambient music, non-euclidean geometry and constant surprises. Throughout it all, the theme of life's journey prevails, echoing the game's original working title: “Hazard: The Journey of Life”.\n\nWhen you open the game, you will find yourself in the Antechamber, a small square room. One wall lists your progress in the current game, one wall functions as the settings menu, one wall is glass through which the Exit can be seen, and the final wall is a map of the Chamber itself. When you begin, only the starting point will be revealed on the map.\n\nClicking this point will transport you to the Chamber. Here you will discover a world that will challenge everything you know and expect about how a first-person game should work. Distance and position mean nothing here. But there are rules. The Chamber will teach you its rules, if you are willing to learn by examining your environment and the way it works. Antichamber provides encouragement via black panels on the walls. Clicking these will reveal a short message that often affirms the solution of the puzzle you just completed, but rarely offers hints.\n\nYou can return to the Antechamber at any time by pressing Esc. You can then use the map to return to any point in the Chamber that you already visited, though any changes you had made in the Chamber will be reset. You are generally guided in the right direction as you progress from one room or hallway to the next, and if you become completely lost Antichamber will draw arrows on the floor or walls to guide you in the right general direction.\n\nNothing is impossible. There are only rules that have not been understood, or tools that have not yet been acquired. Don't be afraid to try anything, even if it seems dangerous or silly. Many puzzles require a tool to complete. You will collect the first tool early in the game, and upgraded versions of it await that can do more. Puzzles involving cubes will generally match the color of the tool that is required.\n\n“Antichamber is a game that’s about you, the player, and your experience of trying to get through the game. It’s not about trying to explicitly tell you a story. [...] There’s a lot of metaphor spread throughout the game, both in terms of the messages you get after completing puzzles and in terms of what the experience as a whole means, but much of that is left open to interpretation.” --Alexander Bruce, creator of Antichamber\n\nAntichamber is beautiful, enigmatic, challenging, at times frustrating. At first glance it seems crazy, but by the end you will understand its rules. All that's left is what you make of it. What will Antichamber mean to you?\n\nHighly recommend, unless you give up easily or are prone to fits of rage.","February 24, 2014","true","43.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Much of the fun of Antichamber comes from figuring out the strange logic that governs things, and using it to make sense out of situations that wouldn't make sense in any other game. It rewards exploration and experimenting more than it does logically deducing the answer on the spot, and fairly often the solution to something can come about by accident while you try everything you can imagine.\n\nHaving a mostly non-linear map that opens up more as you collect new abilities makes it much more fun to progress through than a straight, linear sequence of puzzles and for the most part there is enough direction that the temptation to look at a guide is rarely there. It's an unusual sort of puzzle game that plays smoothly and maintains a certain level of immersion instead of just leaving you wandering in circles in frustration. It can trick you and mess with you, and it is very satisfying to overcome its illusions and quirks.\n\nOn the negative side, your results may vary, but I did find it very hard on the eyes with all the glaring white backgrounds.

My preconceptions were that this was going to be another portal clone - well that thought was shattered pretty quickly. It's more of a personal experience that focuses on how you approach Antichamber.\n\nPuzzles are unique, different, and mindblowing. The only way i can describe when encountering them is the difference between veteren gamers and new gamers. Veteren gamers understand, and take for granted the logic and rules governed by most video games, while new gamers have to learn this process. For Antichamber, it abides by it's own rules - to the point that veteren gamers have to unlearn everything, while new gamers can learn the world without being hindered by pre-existing gamer knowledge. Unless you are a wizard that is!\n\nThe game progresses well, as you learn new concepts and apply them to other puzzles ... until the game pulls the rug under your feet like the slave you are. Here is an idea of what was going through my head for the majority of the puzzles. "WHAT"?, "Ok....", "WHY AM I HERE", "WHERE DO I GO", "THIS GAME SENSE NONE".\n\nStuck on a puzzle? No problem, move on to another and come back to it later. The intuitive map allows you to choose where to go next.\n\nAesthetics are simple with a uniquely distinctive art style. A white background with bright colours. The right contrast to entice you into the world, yet not distracting when taking in the environment to solve a puzzle. Accompanying the visuals is a soundtrack with various natural sounds.\n\nThe only negatives i can think of is if you don't like puzzles then this will be a frustrating experience. I had to take a break after solving several, although that comes with the genre more than anything.\n\nI have been gaming for a long time and nothing has been quite as fresh and breathtaking of a experience than this game.

Though it plays a lot like a First Person Shooter, the object isn't to race through it as quickly as possible and shoot everything in sight; rather, it's appeal lies in the opportunity to explore the world in which you find yourself.  I used to enjoy playing games like Quake, not to blow up monsters, but to try and find all of the secrets and bonuses - this game appeals in the same way.\n\nAnother thing to note is that, even though the game is advertised as "breaking all the rules" as far as gameplay expectations are concerned, the key to solving the game's puzzles is to work out that there actually ARE rules (while the map is definitely non-linear, you can still fidn your way around if you remember how places are connected - and certain symbolic features of the game all work the same way).\n\nIn short, while Antichamber isn't *truly* a rule-breaker, it *is* a game changer, and a welcome breath of fresh air.

Beyond that, every other step is a chance to trip over some spacial awareness wrecking passage or infinitely looping hallway. Depending on how lost you get yourself, this might account for half your playtime before getting to the actual puzzle part of the game.\nThere is more to the game than just wandering lost in a building that's actively trying to get you more lost, and when you reach the point where you're intended to start solving puzzles, Antichamber does finally start to get some cohesion going on, so it's not just a "walking around lost and confused" simulation.\nMy biggest complaint (SPOILERS) is that there's no explanation for what's happening in the game, right up to the end. Not that there's anything wrong with making a game with no story; but Antichamber has the trappings and suggestions that there's something bigger going on, but there's nothing concrete.\nAside from all that, some of the late game puzzles can be pretty dense and difficult to figure out, and the visual motif with the outlines and primary colors can get kind of obnoxious when the game demands that you jump across giant holes in the ground.\nNone of these complaints are enough to keep me from issuing a reccomendation, however, since it's still a very rare example of an artsy game that doesn't feel like the video game equivilent of a coffee house art snob, scoffing at all the "normal" games for not being deep enough. Antichamber is good right at face value, on its own merits and for its own reasons.

When you do, you cannot shut up about it, believe me, I know. What starts out as a simple first person exploration of this seemingly monochromatic puzzle world quickly turns into an unbelievable concept game defying the normal laws of physics and reality.\n\nThe further into the games non-linear progression, the more unusual the puzzles become, requiring some un-orthodox ways of thinking. Things really start to get interesting as new "guns" are unlocked, allowing the user to manipulate matter in different ways, upping the puzzle solving possibilities, all while maintaining the stark no-nonsense interface.

It loves to mess with your perception above all else, things change and defy logic most of the time.\n\nA really cool thing about this game is that every single puzzle translates into some kind of a life lesson or simply motivational quotes. Sometimes the solution will not be hard but will require you do take a different approach, to think outside of the box. Then, the game will re-assess what you did with a little motivational poster that gets put on the wall of the main hub.\n\nThe game feels very mysterious and you're not given a lot of explanation. This is not a game that you play to finish. It's a game that you play to sit back, relax and think. There is actually a conclusion to the game (that I absolutely loved) although it only really ends once you run out of rooms to explore.\n\nThe game makes impressive use of the Unreal Engine and the environment constantly reacts in ways that you would not expect. It is filled with impossible rooms and patterns and requires a ton of open-minded thinking. Honestly, it can get a bit overwhelming at times. Sometimes you feel clever for solving the puzzles and sometimes you're just completely lost in how not rational things are, although there is always a very methodic way to solve them.\n\nIt's also really hard to pick this game back up after not playing for a while. You unlock new mechanics as you progress through the game and not remembering one of them can make solving some puzzles very difficult. Since it's not very long, I would suggest starting over if you haven't played in a while.\n\nAs a side note, I was slighlty more disappointed with the game's technical side. Options are embedded inside the game, there are no menus, which is very cool on its own... But because of this, I could not set the resolution past 1920x1200, there was no anti-aliasing (and the aliasing is fairly bad in this game) or any other graphical options. I don't think there are any keybind options either (I believe this can be done through the Ini files). I would definitely have liked a bit more of these options.\n\nI did not go through all the rooms myself and the game lasted me about 4h30 (played a bit offline so maybe add a few hours to that) for about 75-80% completion. I would expect around 3-4 hours more for 100%. It does feel much, much longer than this however, which is not a bad thing. It's a bit expensive at 22$ for that playtime but honestly, I think it's worth it if this is your kind of game.","February 21","true","4.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Now I'm stuck on a small bit for a moment so I'm giving my head a rest and to write this review. After I exited the game it felt like I was just day dreaming and that everything was going on inside my head. The game's artistic style is something that I really enjoy, it has a nice feeling to it with both vibrant colours and darkish areas. The music and sounds sort of enhance that feeling of daydreaming as well complementing the visuals. At the start you feel a mix of emotions as you don't know what really to expect (if you haven't researched the game at all like me). Things will freak you out but curiosity will get the better of you so many times in this game but it will both reward that curiosity and punish it. Navigation at first seems random and it looks like it's in a random format but once you get the hang of it you can sort of navigate around the levels. The gameplay is fun and the puzzles have a range of difficulties which I will not spoil for you. Controls are alright and pretty easy to use. Should you play this game? Yes, I recommend it. Will I continue to play this game? Once my head recovers.","March 22","true","4.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

You can go through the only door in a room, and come out the other side back in the same room you started in. It makes the puzzles more fun and unique. Granted it can get quite frustrating at times, if you feel like you are going around in circles and not getting anywhere, but suddenly you figure out how to move on from that loop, you almost feel like you've cheated the "Antichamber".\n\nThere’s also these little pictures either at the start or end of puzzles, which you can in ways 'collect' for your wall in the main room. The best part about them is that they act as hints for the puzzles, and they double as nice notes that have little life lesson type morals that also reflect on the puzzles. Not in a cheesy kind of way, it's actually nice to read them and see how they are linked to the puzzle you are about to start, or just finished.\nFrom what I remember, there isn't really any music in the game, just nice ambient sounds that change from puzzle to puzzle, area to area. The graphics and general atmosphere of the game is awesome. I remember when I first seen this game, the first thing that popped into my head was that it kind of has a whole "Negative" look going on. Seeing as the base colour is white, it makes the game all that more unique.\nAll in all this game is amazing and definitely worth a go for anyone that enjoys first person puzzle games. I was actually a little sad when I reached the end.","July 12, 2013","true","18.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game has no story, and a very simplistic visuals. Audio does add to the atmosphere though. The game begins with extremely easy tasks, but the difficulty slowly raises the further you go. What surprised me is that this is not a portal clone at all, whatever screenshots suggest, but it's a puzzle game nonetheless, and the chaces are that if you enjoyed Portal, then you will also enjoy Antichamber. To every puzzle you encounter there is a hint provided. Hints are philosophical reflections, which also give solutions to puzzles - but they are not straightforward and require some logical thinking (you may figure out every puzzle the first time without trial & error style of play - which was the case in Portal too many a time - but as the puzzles become more and more complex you will finally encounter ones that are too difficult for that, unless you are smarter than the developer or me at least). Fortunately, the philosophical reflections are not of 2deep4u kind, so you are not constantly molested with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stuff. They are very simple and kind of cute. It's like the guy who made this game wasn't a typical recluse indie developer suffering from affective disorders and egocentrism, but actually a reasonable and smart dude. The gameworld consist of multiple corridors, which branch in many ways and it's the player who chooses which way he prefers to go (or rather - how he solves puzzles, because they often have multiple solutions). At any time you may come back to any previously encountered puzzle and solve it again, perhaps in a different way leading you to another branch of the "chamber".\n\nOverall, I enjoy this game a lot, despite my inner prejudice towards puzzle and adventure games.","June 21, 2015","true","5.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","6","10","3","0"

The idea of the areas being more open-ended in the sense that you have multiple (sometimes circular or repeatedly dead-end) paths is not necessarily bad, but I feel like it was exhaustively used.\n\nSo many people bring up M.C. Escher and talk about this game as being "art", but I never got a feeling of art from it at any point. Really, the game just had 3 styles to it with the rooms, as I went along: simple and obvious puzzles; really confusing ones that took forever to run around over and over; and then other more obvious puzzles that were explicitly tedious (e.g., having to make sure you get some blocks exactly and don't lose them or clip them with the ray gun, otherwise you have to restart the rooms).\n\nAnd then you had things like the "hints"/messages you come across. Basically, they are taunts from the developer. I never got any sort of emotional reaction out of them as if they were special messages - the majority of them were just some cheesy comment relative to the puzzle you just completed. Very rarely would you see a hint about something you were about to do (or about a split in a path).\n\nI think that most of the game is doable, but is it actually that fun? To me, it really wasn't.","April 19","false","4.0"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","12","22","2","0"

I bought this game because it looked interesting and different, and had some good reviews.  And it IS interesting.  The word "different," however, does not fully convey the magnitude of its strangeness.\n\nThis is a game with which I have a love/hate relationship.  I love the concept -- a game that subverts physical rules and creates its own completely bizarre and disorienting (albeit very very minimalist) world.  I love the break from conventional big-name first-person games that do nothing but show you pretty scenery in which you run around and kill people.  And I initially loved the challenge of solving these weird, brain-teasing puzzles.\n\nThat is, until I started to hate it.  I hate the fact that the gameworld very very frequently loops back on itself and you find yourself solving the same puzzles that you went through quite a while ago.  Perhaps there is a way to play this game so that you avoid all of these loop-back pitfalls; I don't know.  But all too often, I'd fall through a hole that suddenly materializes, or I'd turn a corner, and I'm back at a place that I had passed a long time ago.  This is enough to make me turn off the game in utter frustration.\n\nI also hate the save-game mechanics, which are completely checkpoint-based and not controllable by the player, and do NOT let you save  wherever you want to save.  The checkpoints are too far apart, for one thing.  For another, because of the way that the game loops back on itself, and the fact that the gameworld is so completely disorienting anyway, these checkpoints are rendered fairly useless.  So I'm back at this weird eye in the wall.  For the 29th time.  Except something might be a bit different about it this time around.  You see the problem here?\n\nThis game is like a practical joke on the player.\n\nStill, after these long periods of utter frustration and downtime (quitting the game in disgust), after a few days or a week there is a strange compulsion to give it another go.  To see if any progress can be made THIS TIME.  It's masochistic in a way.  The fascinating, mindbending puzzles keep calling me back, my frustration with the game notwithstanding. I have not finished this game yet, not sure if I'll even be compelled to make it that far.  We'll see.","December 13, 2014","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sure, it does have game mechanics, and those mechanics can be legitimately enjoyable in their own right, but that's not what this game is here for.  Antichamber makes you want to think deeply and seriously about what you're doing, what you're playing, and how you're living, which essentially means that it is extremely confusing and doesn't mind keeping you in the dark for as long as possible.\n\nIt borders on really frustrating, but Antichamber's greatest strength is that it never makes you feel bad for not understanding it.  No matter how "well" or "poorly" you play it, the game will always find a way to show you a witty statement or remark or make you think about the world of both reality and in the game.  You can never "lose" in Antichamber.  You can just get lost in it for a while, which is totally fine by the game.\n\nIf you're a patient type that likes to think more seriously about the games they play and don't mind taking some time to let the experience unfold, then Antichamber is a great experience.

It runs on the Unreal 3 engine so everything works well\n\nGame play:  Everything is totally original.  You will see so many game making innovations from the menu which is literally in first person mode to the crazy colors that make you feel like you are in space odyssey 2001.

The game world is a minimalistic 3D environment that plays with the concept of non-euclidean space ranging from hallways that infinitely loop back on themselves to doors that change destination depending on your perspective.\n\nThe game is quite imaginative at times, avoiding the pitfalls of a lot of similar puzzle games by not having a lot of arbitrary timed puzzles or gating progress by requiring the solving of one particular puzzle. Antichamber takes a vaguely open-world approach to exploration and this means you often have three or more re-visitable branches to explore at any one time.\n\nDon't expect a story though, Antichamber leaves the narrative up to the player, hinting at a deeper meaning through symbolism. The game world is dotted with surprisingly relevant inspirational quotes accompanied by clever little pictures. Collecting all of these soon becomes your measure of completion, even after reaching the pretty spectacular ending level.\n\nAdmittedly, there are a few puzzles requiring a silly amount of planning but these are few and far between. Most of the time, you can come back to these puzzles at a later time with more knowledge and tools and solve them more easily. That is how non-linear gameplay is supposed to be done,; take notes game developers! In addition to some easter-egg rooms, there are even a few bizarrely unfinished areas, hinting that the creator may have had further areas in mind, although there sems to be no real plans to expand the game. Finding these areas is no easy task, and some of the hardest puzzles in the game reside in these places. It's a little sad they didn't get used, even just as an easter egg or something.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, whether or not you will like Antichamber depends on if you are the kind of person who doesn't mind a puzzle game where you are invited to take your time exploring every corner. At worst, Antichamber can be a bit of a confusing labyrinth, but at best it is a forgiving puzzle game with outside-the-box visuals and a great sense of variety.","January 7, 2014","true","20.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its a journey that feels like something you didn't feel before. I cant explain that feeling. You need to find that yourself;\n\nYou are in a place that based upon chamber that aren't chamber. While solving puzzles and having white walls around you. You can also hear the birds and the air. I dont why but it feels like you are walking in a park but you are solving puzzle with a strange gun that contains cubes that can be used for solving the puzzles around you.\n\nGameplay is really basic. You have a gun, you can pick up cubes that has a different color, first its blue, then its changes when you get better guns.\n\nEvery gun adds a new feature. Puzzle gets harder everytime you get a new gun.\n\nOk, here is a example of a puzzle. You walk on a square white corridor, floor and ceiling is white too. You see two ladder, one is red and one is blue. One is going down and other goes up. You choose one. Lets say you chose blue one that goes up. You walk a little bit and you end up in that first place that you can choose up and down. You choose another one, it goes on for a while. After two times or more you realize this is not gonna go anywhere. So you walk back. Other then finding out the blue ladder that you chose before, you end up in a different corridor you didnt see before. You scrolling around in a corridor and you end up in a place that there is gonna be another puzzle more confusing than this.\nThis puzzle I just tried to explain to you is the least confusing one, for me anyway.\n\nYou can beat the game in 10 minutes (Trust me, I tried and completed in 9:38 minutes) but this game is big. İt is open world but it also linear (I think thats why they call this game ''Antchamber''). I beat the game about ten times now and I can find new rooms that I never saw before so easily, just by wondering around.\n\nI give this game 10/10 very easily. Im not even joking or making IGN jokes that are stopped being funny about a year now.","December 23, 2013","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Similar to Portal in some ways, it's more of a contemplative game that rely on perception and out-of-the-box thinking (sometimes quite literally).\n\nWith unique visuals (that might not please everyone) and superb sound design, this game will give you plenty of challenge (maybe a bit too much if you're not enclined to look for help) and will reward you for it.\n\nOn the downside, controls are not that good (you will need to edit config files for that) and the "block" agencing mechanic is not optimal in a 3D environment (keyboard/mouse as well as X360 controller) which will lead to frustration, especially when a specific timing is required. It should also be noted that the game is still unfinished in some ways and there are some bugs that might never be fixed (nothing game-breaking as I witnessed).","April 12, 2014","true","10.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The puzzles themselves are not what makes this game unique, but the line being constantly crossed between what's real and unreal. The game isn't "oh so crazy" that trying to navigate logically will screw you over, but it also does not obey the rules of space. I wanted to keep playing, to the end, without stopping, and I do believe that would be the best way to do it for the experience. The ambient track is slightly unsettling/calming, and the whole concept and execution has loads of meaning which is up for you to find yourself. I do believe this was very well done, except I do think it could've done without the signs everywhere with cliché life lessons for hints.

But a clear or comprehensible storyline is essentially non-existent in this game. However, this is by no means a shortcoming of the game; rather it allows the player to use their imagination to determine what is actually happening while keeping the focus on what it should be focussing on, that is the gameplay and puzzles.\n\nThe puzzles themselves started out fairly simple while you begin to take in and understand exactly what you have to do in this antichamber into which you've been thrusted. This point of the game I personally found a little tedious as there is quite a bit of wandering to do amongst the seemingly endless chambers. However, once you find the cube gun (I don't know what it is actually called, but hey) the game becomes much more linear and allows you to explore your new tool's full capabilities, which leads to some fairly interesting results. In addition to this, the pacing is excellent in that the difficulty increases proportionately to the amount you know about how to fully utilise the gun. This is coupled with little life lessons that appear before and/or after completion of a puzzle that perfectly describe the impending problem or its solution. I really liked this addition as it is kind of like your own little pocket Confucious that could help you solve real-world problems if you can find the appropriate connections and parallels. While the puzzles aren't the most difficult I've ever done, they are certainly the ones most capable of ... ahem ... BLOWING YOUR MIND.\n\nWith that note I move onto the aspect I enjoyed the most, the graphics. The game uses a limited colour palette, with most rooms being white with black borders. However this makes the use of colour that much more effective as it can go from bland to completely vibrant in a couple of seconds, completely changing the mood and re-energising the player. This is definitely one of the strong points of the game as it really makes the entire experience feel surreal, as if you really are in a non-existent room, outside of time and space, a chamber that isn't really a chamber: an Antichamber (Dun dun DUUUN)\n\nAside from this, I will admit that I found the controls a little imprecise at times which led to some minor drawbacks, but overall this is my only other complaint with the game. It is by no means perfect, nor is it high on my list of amazing games, but I definitely enjoyed the short time I spent playing this game and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone fond of puzzles.","December 21, 2013","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Similar to Portal in some ways, it's more of a contemplative game that rely on perception and out-of-the-box thinking (sometimes quite literally).\n\nWith unique visuals (that might not please everyone) and superb sound design, this game will give you plenty of challenge (maybe a bit too much if you're not enclined to look for help) and will reward you for it.\n\nOn the downside, controls are not that good (you will need to edit config files for that) and the "block" agencing mechanic is not optimal in a 3D environment (keyboard/mouse as well as X360 controller) which will lead to frustration, especially when a specific timing is required.

Yes, you can succeed in 'Antichamber,' sometimes on accident; there are puzzles to solve, and there is a goal. But the goal doesn't really matter; 'Antichamber' is definitely about the things you see on the journey rather than the destination or even the journey itself. The puzzles should be maddening, but they're not. There is a soothing, peaceful detachment to the game, as you wander around the impossible, intricate maze. The mechanic of the space around you warping based on your perception doesn't get old, though there are times when you just really, really want to get past a door - and have absolutely no idea how to do so.\n\nIt's definitely not for everyone, but it's worth a look for no other reason than just to see it.

Antichamber is full of the first sort. The visuals are fairly stark and minimalist. It's a deliberate aesthetic choice, and one that works brilliantly. There's nothing to distract from the sheer strangeness of the environment and its seeming utter disregard for the basic laws of spatial navigation.

It is a very fresh experience that promotes self-investigation. The closest thing to the game telling you its actual rules are these parables you come across. Antichamber does not play out in strict Euclidean space, and the laws of physics are not expressed the same as we experience them in real life. This produces a world with its own flavor and intrinsic beauty. Learning the way the world works in Antichamber IS the driving force of its gameplay, and WOW is it done well.","January 6, 2014","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unlike Portal, which gave you brain-bending ways to explore the physics of the real world (flinging, wheeeeeee!), Antichamber dispenses with the real world altogether. Turn around and you may not see the room you just came from. Turn a corner and find yourself where you were. Rooms overlap, you can go up by going sideways, and things disappear when you stop looking...\n\nAll of this sounds like it doesn't make sense, but very pleasingly it does. The place runs on logic and self-consistency and everything (well, I suspect most things) has a well-reasoned solution. The puzzles are solid, polished, and nothing's so hard that you can't solve it.

From a map that's jam-packed with secrets and rooms to a puzzling boss level, this game gets better and better.

It is an excellent addition to any gaming library thanks to its challenging puzzles and its psychological manipulation of common expectations.\n\nWhile the basic cell-shaded graphics may be down to the game's budget, Antichamber pulls them off brilliantly. Bright primary colours blanket areas where other games might use high quality textures, and interesting particle effects stand out as a visual cue rather than as something to be expected. This adds to the game's poignant art style, as well as making it run smoothly on less capable computers.\n\nAntichamber's gameplay mechanics switch between bending the fabric of reality and rule-oriented cube placement. Many puzzles' currencies are doled out as these collectable cubes, with different colours representing possible hints towards a solution. Other puzzles involving movement, physics, and even view orientation are welcome additions that are interspersed regularly. The pacing flows nicely between areas, and each puzzle is unique enough to stay fresh. Rooms that seem inaccessible earlier on will eventually be attainable once new techniques of manipulating cubes are discovered. While this does make for a lot of back-tracking, Antichamber's theme revolves around revisiting the impossible.\n\nAside from teaching the basics of how to utilize its tools, the game leaves interaction with its cubed building-blocks up to the player. The imposed experiential learning leads to many “Eureka!” moments during Antichamber's journey. The game balances them perfectly with some of the more difficult challenges; each solution is just enough of an ego boost to keep spirits high before perplexing players with a new situation. Even the more stupefying tasks never seem arduous, in part because of their basic elegance but also thanks to the omnipresent musical atmosphere.\n\nExcellent sound effects are probably the main reason why Antichamber maintains such a calm ambiance. Whether splashing through a shallow pond or standing on a windy mountaintop, the sounds of nature are always present and never get tedious. This contrast between the game's claustrophobic interiors and its superb outdoor soundscape is very mentally stimulating and adds to Antichamber's aloofness. Thankfully, the oddly juxtaposed soundtrack avoids over-complicating itself, which keeps the focus on exploring and solving puzzles.\n\nDepending on how thoroughly it's completed, expect this journey to last between eight to twelve hours. Although certain puzzles are inevitably stumping, pulling through them is what makes Antichamber so satisfying to play. Its engrossing atmosphere and frequent instances of disbelief combine to form one of this generation's most appealing puzzle games.","August 3, 2013","true","17.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The game takes place entirely in what is like a maze of puzzles and all the while twisting back on itself and bending the rules of reality to both mind boggling as well as enchanting levels. The puzzles do get challenging and while there is no real story, the cryptic messages found on the walls throughout the game sort of give the sense that you are being watched, not by some character but rather by the antichamber itself. It is a beautiful concept of creating a sort of relationship with the environment and unlocking its secrets and learning that there really are some rules, is an incredibly rewading experience.

The only complaint I had about the game was that the immersion can wear on you. Enough time in the chambers and you begin to actually feel that tinge of hopelessness, and stress that your character would likely experience.

There are quite a few ways you have to manipulate blocks to get around, some of which won't be immediately obvious. And, as well-demonstrated in the trailer, the game loves looping around in ways that would be entirely impossible in geometry as we normally experience it.\n\nThe only downside is that the game is rather short (I finished it within four hours) and has relatively limited replayability.

Only the box is 4 dimentional. Or is it?\nAntichamber throws all conventional puzzling out the window, and constantly forces you to improvise, observe, and think. Sometimes the solution can be as simple as 'look in a specific direction'. Because in Antichamber, rules of physics do not apply. Or they do, and you just do not understand how. The experience is the definition of non-linearity and is pretty much one of a kind. If you like to challenge your mind and are not repulsed by somewhat unpleasant art-style, if you'd like to expirience something unique, get Antichamber.

Yes, you can succeed in 'Antichamber,' sometimes on accident; there are puzzles to solve, and there is a goal. But the goal doesn't really matter; 'Antichamber' is definitely about the things you see on the journey rather than the destination or even the journey itself. The puzzles should be maddening, but they're not. There is a soothing, peaceful detachment to the game, as you wander around the impossible, intricate maze. The mechanic of the space around you warping based on your perception doesn't get old, though there are times when you just really, really want to get past a door - and have absolutely no idea how to do so.\n\nIt's definitely not for everyone, but it's worth a look for no other reason than just to see it.

It is an excellent addition to any gaming library thanks to its challenging puzzles and its psychological manipulation of common expectations.\n\nWhile the basic cell-shaded graphics may be down to the game's budget, Antichamber pulls them off brilliantly. Bright primary colours blanket areas where other games might use high quality textures, and interesting particle effects stand out as a visual cue rather than as something to be expected. This adds to the game's poignant art style, as well as making it run smoothly on less capable computers.\n\nAntichamber's gameplay mechanics switch between bending the fabric of reality and rule-oriented cube placement. Many puzzles' currencies are doled out as these collectable cubes, with different colours representing possible hints towards a solution. Other puzzles involving movement, physics, and even view orientation are welcome additions that are interspersed regularly. The pacing flows nicely between areas, and each puzzle is unique enough to stay fresh. Rooms that seem inaccessible earlier on will eventually be attainable once new techniques of manipulating cubes are discovered. While this does make for a lot of back-tracking, Antichamber's theme revolves around revisiting the impossible.\n\nAside from teaching the basics of how to utilize its tools, the game leaves interaction with its cubed building-blocks up to the player. The imposed experiential learning leads to many “Eureka!” moments during Antichamber's journey. The game balances them perfectly with some of the more difficult challenges; each solution is just enough of an ego boost to keep spirits high before perplexing players with a new situation. Even the more stupefying tasks never seem arduous, in part because of their basic elegance but also thanks to the omnipresent musical atmosphere.\n\nExcellent sound effects are probably the main reason why Antichamber maintains such a calm ambiance. Whether splashing through a shallow pond or standing on a windy mountaintop, the sounds of nature are always present and never get tedious. This contrast between the game's claustrophobic interiors and its superb outdoor soundscape is very mentally stimulating and adds to Antichamber's aloofness. Thankfully, the oddly juxtaposed soundtrack avoids over-complicating itself, which keeps the focus on exploring and solving puzzles.\n\nDepending on how thoroughly it's completed, expect this journey to last between eight to twelve hours. Although certain puzzles are inevitably stumping, pulling through them is what makes Antichamber so satisfying to play. Its engrossing atmosphere and frequent instances of disbelief combine to form one of this generation's most appealing puzzle games.","August 3, 2013","true","17.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

But a clear or comprehensible storyline is essentially non-existent in this game. However, this is by no means a shortcoming of the game; rather it allows the player to use their imagination to determine what is actually happening while keeping the focus on what it should be focussing on, that is the gameplay and puzzles.\n\nThe puzzles themselves started out fairly simple while you begin to take in and understand exactly what you have to do in this antichamber into which you've been thrusted. This point of the game I personally found a little tedious as there is quite a bit of wandering to do amongst the seemingly endless chambers. However, once you find the cube gun (I don't know what it is actually called, but hey) the game becomes much more linear and allows you to explore your new tool's full capabilities, which leads to some fairly interesting results. In addition to this, the pacing is excellent in that the difficulty increases proportionately to the amount you know about how to fully utilise the gun. This is coupled with little life lessons that appear before and/or after completion of a puzzle that perfectly describe the impending problem or its solution. I really liked this addition as it is kind of like your own little pocket Confucious that could help you solve real-world problems if you can find the appropriate connections and parallels. While the puzzles aren't the most difficult I've ever done, they are certainly the ones most capable of ... ahem ... BLOWING YOUR MIND.\n\nWith that note I move onto the aspect I enjoyed the most, the graphics. The game uses a limited colour palette, with most rooms being white with black borders. However this makes the use of colour that much more effective as it can go from bland to completely vibrant in a couple of seconds, completely changing the mood and re-energising the player. This is definitely one of the strong points of the game as it really makes the entire experience feel surreal, as if you really are in a non-existent room, outside of time and space, a chamber that isn't really a chamber: an Antichamber (Dun dun DUUUN)\n\nAside from this, I will admit that I found the controls a little imprecise at times which led to some minor drawbacks, but overall this is my only other complaint with the game. It is by no means perfect, nor is it high on my list of amazing games, but I definitely enjoyed the short time I spent playing this game and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone fond of puzzles.","December 21, 2013","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Then the games begin.\n\nI don't think I'll ever enjoy a puzzler quite like I enjoyed this one.","December 23, 2013","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you like puzzle games then you'll like this. Antichamber is a puzzle/adventure game that messes with your mind. As Nerd³ said "When you play this game, you need to think outside of the box. And i mean REALLY think outside the box." When you play this you may come across a room where you're just like 'HOW THE **** DO I DO THIS?' then you go back a couple of rooms and when you get back there with a different 'gun', you think 'how did I not know how to do this?'.

However, once you get into the game you're in for hours of entertainment and mind-bending puzzles. You'll encounter situations that would otherwise occur only in an M. C. Escher painting, and the first casualty of the game will be your basic sense of geometric logic. Your mind will twist in a way that puts even Portal to shame, that you can't help but wonder in amazement how the developers even got the engine to behave like they wanted it to. And when you do finally end up solving the puzzles, the sense of accomplishment you get from it is like almost nothing else.\n\nIf you don't have this game in your Steam Library, you should fix that problem ASAP, because this game really is that fun.

The only thing I'm not sure I like is the fact that you'll encounter plenty of puzzles that cannot be solved until you revist them later with a new manipulation tool. There are positives to that approach but I also think it leads to a lot of confusion and frustration that could easilly put someone off.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this.

The ambient track is slightly unsettling/calming, and the whole concept and execution has loads of meaning which is up for you to find yourself.

However, once you get into the game you're in for hours of entertainment and mind-bending puzzles. You'll encounter situations that would otherwise occur only in an M. C. Escher painting, and the first casualty of the game will be your basic sense of geometric logic. Your mind will twist in a way that puts even Portal to shame, that you can't help but wonder in amazement how the developers even got the engine to behave like they wanted it to. And when you do finally end up solving the puzzles, the sense of accomplishment you get from it is like almost nothing else.\n\nIf you don't have this game in your Steam Library, you should fix that problem ASAP, because this game really is that fun. It has an extremely simple control scheme, but the game is so complex and deep that it definitely beats many other titles out there.","January 3, 2014","true","8.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Whoever enters this place, leave here all your preconceived ideas about what games are, along with your definition of logic. Might as well put your sanity in a box and kick it goodbye until you finish Antichamber.  That's what I did after 10 minutes, and it felt great. For the 5 hours it lasted, I enjoyed being toyed around by an unending flow of pseudo-philosophical panels, a weird mix of portal-like puzzles and weird thingies, made of cubes, eyes and colors. I came sceptical, I shouldn't have. I came thinking forward is forward, that up is up, and that I was smart.\n\nTurns out I was wrong.\n\nSo, what is Antichamber ? Definitely not a game that'll make you laugh. Definitely not a game that'll make you feel accomplished. Hell, I don't even know if I can call it a game. But if you are willing to take a probe up your try something new, something that will challenge everything you know, then go forward. You won't understand everything. You won't like everything. You probably won't play more than 30mn at a time.

It's not like anything like you've seen before. Looking at the game screenshots you can clearly see that its graphics are awesome. But if you will buy this game, you will experience something more than just brilliant game. Throughout the game the very matter of your mind will change and you will look at things around you differrently. Every room you will encounter will require you to forget all you have learnt throughout your real life. The game itself will crush your common sense just as you will notice that there are no such thing as x, y and z axis. walking through the door can lead you to the room that was above you seconds ago. Besides messing with your brain with mind-twisting puzzles Antichamber guides you through your life with signs you can read after completing each challenge. (Shhh! Antichamber is also full of easter eggs!)  Antichamber is a clearly philosophical game as it doesn't have a plot. (Yes, that's right. You just spawn in the dark room and follow instructions how to enter the Antichamber.) The Antichamber shows the whole life cycle. For example, if at first you knew nothing about the game and the very simple element of the game puzzled you, at the end of the game even the most complex mind-breaker will not take more than five minutes to solve. Antichamber is a definite must-play.\n\n10/10","December 14, 2013","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sure, it does have game mechanics, and those mechanics can be legitimately enjoyable in their own right, but that's not what this game is here for.  Antichamber makes you want to think deeply and seriously about what you're doing, what you're playing, and how you're living, which essentially means that it is extremely confusing and doesn't mind keeping you in the dark for as long as possible.\n\nIt borders on really frustrating, but Antichamber's greatest strength is that it never makes you feel bad for not understanding it.  No matter how "well" or "poorly" you play it, the game will always find a way to show you a witty statement or remark or make you think about the world of both reality and in the game.  You can never "lose" in Antichamber.  You can just get lost in it for a while, which is totally fine by the game.\n\nIf you're a patient type that likes to think more seriously about the games they play and don't mind taking some time to let the experience unfold, then Antichamber is a great experience.

This game will have you wander, ponder, and whatever else that rhymes with yonder.\n\nI can honestly say this is one of the most unique puzzle games I've ever experianced. Filled with a somewhat eerie atmosphere and seemingly complicated puzzles, this game helps you think in and out of the box simultaniously. Each notes/hints you encounter are designed to help you think differently than you normally would to solve the problem infront of you, as well as give you something to think about in real life. I strongly recommend this game, as it will most likely be a unique experience that you won't regret having.\n\nMy score: 9.5/10","February 23, 2014","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No spoilers of course.\n\nAntichamber is a puzzle game unlike literally anything you've ever known. It's got the same 'how did I not get that, I'm so dumb' feeling as Portal/Portal 2, but also has the feel of the Stanley Parable. Like the Stanley Parable, the secret of Antichamber isn't what happens, but the underlying meaning and denseness of what's going on. It's hard to explain, but that's what it's like.\n\nThe Good:\n\nAntichamber is something just fantastically mental. While it has the just puzzle elements of other games like Portal, the rest of it depends on your understanding of what the bloody hell is going on. The messing of perspective and non-euclidian nature of shapes and things is totally new and bonkers. Also it looks very nice too. While not particularly graphically exiting, it does have a nice colour scheme, base white with other colours painted onto it. And the exploration of the one HUGE  level (No loading screens!) and manipulation of 'stuff' with your four guns opens possibilities. Sometimes to go fowards, you have to backtrack, get something and try again.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe puzzles can certainly be very weak. After obtaining the guns, rather than being perspective neural nightmares, they just become block puzzles. Some can be very, very difficult, so you'll either wonder around aimlessly for while for something to do, or just google the answer. And also it doesn't support some resolutions, like 1600x900. Finally, I would say for £15, I think it's a little overpriced. Maybe £10 pounds would be more reasonable.\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nIf you just want something new and ingenious, just buy it. While you may forget it after you get stuck on one puzzle for 1000 years, the 999 years beforehand will most likely be fantastically bonkers.","February 14, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

This game pulls off the trick of creating a 3d environment out of an Escher drawing. The game takes place entirely in what is like a maze of puzzles and all the while twisting back on itself and bending the rules of reality to both mind boggling as well as enchanting levels. The puzzles do get challenging and while there is no real story, the cryptic messages found on the walls throughout the game sort of give the sense that you are being watched, not by some character but rather by the antichamber itself. It is a beautiful concept of creating a sort of relationship with the environment and unlocking its secrets and learning that there really are some rules, is an incredibly rewading experience.

Yes, you can succeed in 'Antichamber,' sometimes on accident; there are puzzles to solve, and there is a goal. But the goal doesn't really matter; 'Antichamber' is definitely about the things you see on the journey rather than the destination or even the journey itself. The puzzles should be maddening, but they're not. There is a soothing, peaceful detachment to the game, as you wander around the impossible, intricate maze. The mechanic of the space around you warping based on your perception doesn't get old, though there are times when you just really, really want to get past a door - and have absolutely no idea how to do so.\n\nIt's definitely not for everyone, but it's worth a look for no other reason than just to see it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OllyTrolly/recommended/219890/","OllyTrolly","OllyTrolly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OllyTrolly/","562 products in account","I guess in a nutshell I'd say this is the lateral puzzle-solving brother of Portal's more logical puzzle-solving. Where in Portal the rules are pretty clear early on, and you have to use those rules to further yourself through the game, Antichamber continually asks what the rules actually are. Later on in the game it evolves into some slightly more logical puzzle-solving, but even then it feels like a nice blend of lateral and logical.\n\nThe visual style is very effective at what it does, even sometimes quite pretty (there's a particular 'gallery' in the game full of cool geometry and optical illusions that I love). As in Portal, a stark, simple aesthetic is used to bring attention to what's important, although in this game the use of colour is more important and also kind of trippy.\n\nThe story feels a little odd, as it is mainly relayed through wall doodles that reveal 'insights' about life that relate to how you solve or have solved a puzzle. Of all the parts of the game I'd say that's the weakest, but I don't think it really dilutes the experience, and it at least signposts your route through the world.\n\nI've seen that some people don't enjoy that this game refuses to hold your hand, but that's precisely what I loved so much about it. Being confused by a seemingly impossible puzzle only to realise it was obvious if I just thought about it in a different way, was really entertaining and satisfying. If you enjoy lateral thinking, if you enjoy inventive puzzle games, or even if you just enjoy being challenged and surprised, I can't recommend this game enough. One of the best puzzle games ever made in my opinion.","January 9","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The fact that I'm uncertain about that already tells you a whole lot about this game. In technical terms, one would describe it best as a first-person Metroidvania puzzler; but most conventional genre descriptors are far too generic for this convention-defier. If you love puzzles that are so headache-inducingly ingenious that the preposterous becomes intuitive, or if you just like to have your gray matter tickled, I'd definitely recommend this game.\n\nOne downside I'd note, though, is that - for some people, such as myself - the game is not only figuratively, but also literally headache-inducing. I'm not sure whether it's the brightness of the visuals, the ambient sound design, or what, but I found it difficult to play this game for extended stretches of time, which is a shame because the game is quite addicting!\n\nOh, I should also add, the game was very kindly gifted to me; I would not say it's worth its current price tag, though how long you'll be playing it will strongly depend on your wits and your willpower to resist looking up strategy guides.","December 20, 2014","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On first play, I thought it was interesting and clever but also very frustrating. Second time I played, I found the first manipulation device and it all started to click. The puzzles are often hard but always logical within the rules that antichamber lays out (so far at least).\nThe introduction of new concepts is well paced. The only thing I'm not sure I like is the fact that you'll encounter plenty of puzzles that cannot be solved until you revist them later with a new manipulation tool. There are positives to that approach but I also think it leads to a lot of confusion and frustration that could easilly put someone off.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DragonSeishiroLeonhart/recommended/219890/","DragonSeishiroLeonhart","Seishiro Leonhart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DragonSeishiroLeonhart/","278 products in account","Antichamber, a game which hardly makes sense, except that sense is not required here, because all you have to really use is your brain, making your way through your "life".\nBasically this game is to teach some meanings of life, in a fun way, you have to make through various puzzles using tips used in real life, like for example: If you only think of right now, you won't have enough for later. Things that you mother and father would tell you during the course of your life.\nI can say that this game is not really supposed to have a story, I could say that this is mostly a game to think to solve the puzzles, and maybe learn something which is going to be REALLY useful in your life, in a fun way, until you are able to finish your "quest" or as it can be seen in this game, your "life".\n\nGraphics: I'll say that the graphic is quite simple, but yet very attractive and colorful (I love colorful games!) in some parts, and the block gun look very interesting and ironically, reverses the conditions colors I like to use specially in survival games (Blue for perfect health, Green for little damage, yellow for medium damage and red for heavy damage), being the first on the blue and the last the Red gun, as a little downside, I think most of the corridors were a little lifeless, the walls were all white, it gives you a strange feeling of lolyness, maybe it was the intention of the game (9.5/10)\nStory: Like mentioned before, I believe this game wasn't really made to have a story, except for learning some meanings of life in a fun way, and the player (which the appearance is unknown) must pass the challenges in his "life", none of the happenings made any sense at all, like, why (s)he was there, who was (s)he, and what happened in the ending (I'll avoid making spoilers). The story didn't make much sense, so I'm afraid the story will get a so so rating, but hey! Just because the story is confusing somewhat doesn't mean the game is bad! (6/10)\nSound: Whoa, how I did like the sounds in the game, the sounds gave quite a good touch to the game, when you are falling at a very high speed, that good sound of the air passing on your ears, when you land, and the sounds of you moving, absorbing and firing the blocks, gave a great touch to the game, in any moment I never got tired of the sound effects, and the music was very calm, a perfect music to let the player think through the puzzles, I simply have nothing but good things to say about the sounds (10/10)\nDepth: Depending on how well can you think on the solution of the puzzles, the game can take quite a while to beat (I almost beat the game 100% in around 20 hours, being some of those hours idle), and having various different paths, including some deadends, if you are looking to explore everything in the game, it's going to take a while, if you are just aiming to find the exit, the game will be a bit shorter, looking at the map (there is a map of the rooms explored on the wall of the game start chamber), the game seems to have needed to have a few more rooms. (8/10)\nAddictiveness: Awesome, I can safely say that until I could find almost all the black signs (you can see all the black signs you found during the game on the game start chamber), I never got tired of the game, but after I've given up to find the last 5 black signs, I didn't really feel like playing again. (8/10)\nDifficulty: I can say that the difficulty is at it's exact point to the human mind, the challenges fits exactly accordingly to a smart person, I had to put a lot of thought through the challenges, to solve 'em, some were simple, and some you had to be more experienced and have more "Tools" to work them out.

With a very steep learning curve, it's definitely a smart game made for smart gamers. The minimalist soundtrack of natural sounds, from bird calls to the crackling of a fireplace, really lulled me into a sense of immersion, curiosity and peacefulness. The art style of Antichamber starkly contrasts the hyperrealism of blockbuster games like Call of Duty: environments are sparse, with deliberate use of color and contours, but very little detail. Furthermore, the few visual cues available serve as hints or teach new game mechanics, even if their meaning is ambiguous at first. What I enjoyed most about Antichamber, after reading several interviews with developer Alexander Bruce, is that the game serves as an allegory for life's vicissitudes - sometimes you're up, and other times, you're down. The cartoon plaques in each of the game's rooms are captioned with pithy quotes (e.g. failing to succeed does not mean failing to progress) that serve not only advise the player about how to solve each puzzle, but also how live more gracefully. A must-play for gamers seeking a cerebral, but rewarding challenge.","February 27","true","12.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The design is incredibly clever, and the satisfaction you get from solving another puzzle to move forward will make you feel equally cunning.

I enetered this game expecting it to be akin to Portal, and while it was in some senses, they are two entirely different experiences. Portal gets you to think with...portals, and Antichamber just simply requires you to think outside the box. While it is a simple concept, some of the challenges can prove to be quite difficult.\nI really cant find many problems with this game. The only thing that comes to mind is that sometimes the  game can  double up on the solution to puzzles. This is quite noticable around midway through the game, when around 2-3 of the puzzles have the same solution. That being said, the sheer uniqueness of some of the other puzzles more than make up for this.\nSome may find that the game isn't extremely replayable. However, for me this wasn't too much of a problem, and I thoroughly enjoyed the game even on my second playthrough.\n\nOverall, amazing game, an extremely unique game to the genre, and a must-buy during sales.\n9/10","July 14, 2015","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/219890/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Antichamber is a weird game to review, as it stands on a league of its own. It's not trying to be a good game. On the contrary, it's actually throwing most conventions out the window, and challenging the player to see it through.\n\nLet's say it's a first person puzzle game. If you need a comparison, Portal would be a decent choice. However, where Portal clearly gives you the mechanics and expects you to use them to solve the puzzles, Antichamber makes you dig a lot to find those mechanics and how it all fits and interacts. The game is purposely trying to bend the players' minds at every turn, and it certainly succeeds in doing exactly that!\n\nI'm not going to do the usual review on this game. It simply wouldn't work, and would achieve nothing. So I'm going to try to convey the game's fundamental aspects, and you'll then judge for yourself if you're interested enough.\n\n\nThe game also has some Metroid-vania elements regarding its map. However, while those games obey "real-world" rules, Antichamber laughs at them. The whole game is a non-Euclidian maze (meaning it doesn't obey 3D geometry rules -- when you turn back, the rooms may have changed; maybe you can go down enough that you're back where you're started; you get the idea). However, you are given a very useful map, which functions almost as a progress meter. With its use, you'll know *some* of the connected areas, but above all else, you'll know when there are still ways to uncover in a given room.\n\nAntichamber is essentially about sheer willpower and deconstruction. You're not given anything. Instead, you need to find it yourself, and then experiment with your new tools to solve more of the puzzles. The game also has a few signs with messages, giving you feedback for your actions (and the meaning of life, if you're so inclined). It works almost as post-tutorialization. The game is about learning for yourself. About having to learn to progress. Since the knowledge you had previously (as conventions) doesn't work, you'll have to start from the very beginning. To solidify your discoveries, the game usually gives you a short phrase (and picture) to relate it to life itself. And it helps giving context to what you're doing, setting it all in stone.\nEventually, you'll be able to make the game's logic almost conventional, weirdly enough. You adapt to the weird world you've been thrown in, and it feels great to realize how far you've come.\n\nThere are lots of branching paths, each leading to a new puzzle. However, you have a Hub Area in which you can jump into every puzzle directly (after you've found it). It would be impossible to complete the game without it, since traversing the map is everything but convenient. This is also something that goes well with the fact that you'll be stuck a lot.\nEither you haven't learned a certain mechanic well enough, or you're lacking a certain tool for a puzzle. But you'll be forced to turn back. And the game helps you with that a lot. So you'll be constantly trying out new puzzles, and shying away from others. It's fine. The game was made with that very intent, and it uses that to its advantage, avoiding a lot of frustration.\n\n\nAnother aspect is that there are mostly no wrong actions. Everything is a choice, and the game responds to everything you do -- it may just not be the answer you were looking for.\nI've seen the question on the forums "What's the point"? Well... there is not point, other than discovery, and basically deconstructing the world until you master its own way of thinking. You don't have anyone to save or kill. No reward waiting for you either. But curiosity will certaily keep you moving forward -- well, maybe not technically forward... up and to the right, maybe. Maybe backwards, who knows? -- and it's incredibly rewarding to solve some puzzles that were particularly difficult to you.\n\n\nIt is a very, very unique game. And it's hard to explain what it is or why anyone should play it. But I'll say this: it's the game I'd recommend to most people, even if they're not into games. And that's because it's an unique experience, not necessarily tied to traditional games. The same may happen with movies or even music. People may not like movies all that much, but there are some that are worth watching anyway, for one reason or another.\n\nAgain, it's on a league of its own. It also shares some similarities with Fez, in that regard. However, Fez requires you to take knowledge from outside of the game, while Antichamber requires you to throw all knowledge away.\n\nThere are also some Dev Rooms that will give you some information about the development of the game. It's nice that they're there.\n\n\n\nIf you want to be challenged, dazed and confused... Definitely get this game. And play it through without a guide, otherwise its charm is all lost. Persistence is important, but it's one of the most rewarding games I've played in a long, long time. And it works nicely as food for thought as well.\nI have never played anything even remotely close to Antichamber (not saying it's the best game I've ever played, simply that it's very different from everything else I came across), and it's a well executed game. It's interesting not only in concept, but in practice as well. Give it a go!","October 5, 2014","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It mostly deals with cube excursion and teaching lessons that do not alway follow the general laws of nature. The game is something that should be played by any puzzle game fan. It definitely makes you think and promotes the idea of anything is possible and just leaves you confused sometimes but that is why you are able to work at different locations of the place when you choose. It gives you a wide variety of puzzles as well as plenty of them to solve. The gameplay is solid and enjoyable, at least if you are not stuff on the same puzzle for a hour or more. The graphics are not amazing but that was openly expressed by the developers that they did not want to distract from the experience with fancy environments or graphics. Even without flashy effects and realistic atmosphere, the game still makes a fine puzzle game. I have had no trouble with any bugs or anything that break the game so it is good all around and I recommend it to puzzle video game fans mostly but still fun more most people I would say.","July 27, 2015","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While I'm far from considering myself a "classic gamer", one thing I find a bit exasperating about almost all modern games is how they will persistently hold your hand in a manner that, even if it doesn’t remove the challenge entirely, certainly does a lot to insult your intelligence. You will not run into this problem in Antichamber, and this for me is its main charm. Much like the very first Legend of Zelda game, AC starts you out in an unknown, unexplained world and you have to learn the rules by yourself, some writing on the walls telling you how to control your newfound matter gun (which I didn't even find until maybe 2 hours in playing the game and honestly completely forgot about until I did) and upgrades the only real guides you'll be getting, aside from some delightful life lessons you only receive after completing the puzzles they refer to. The simple puzzles quickly become daunting and brain-teasing, though a small few can become a bit tedious (and one puzzle in particular, albeit optional and only leading to an extra dev room, is complete and utter BS). However, for the most part the game has an excellent track record of keeping your mind stimulated and providing many rewarding and even cathartic moments, and many puzzles are an absolute joy for me to replay over and over again.\n\nI also love the game’s minimalist presentation. You’ll be spending a lot of your time in pure white hallways, frequently visiting rooms that sport a color scheme ripped out of an MS Paint palette, but the game finds ways to use even its graphic simplicity to its advantage (many of the game’s puzzles and tricks wouldn’t work too well, I don’t think, in a more detailed aesthetic). I’ve seen people refer to the game as “ugly”, and while it certainly isn’t too easy on the eyes, it still finds ways to look just as charming as it plays.\n\nAt a glance, the game could easily be describled as "Portal with blocks” (even though development on this game started a year before Portal was released), but what sets it apart from its mad scientist peer more than anything is while Portal follows a very linear storyline, AC is completely open, nonlinear, and ready and waiting to have every conceivable corner explored—as soon as you figure out your way around. Another important difference that makes AC stand on its own is that where Portal’s theme is based around physics, science and strict logic, AC’s theme is its complete and utter deconstruction of your preconceptions of logic and reality, and while logic isn’t necessarily completely absent from the game, it has created its own, new set of rules that, again, you have to figure out for yourself.\n\nThis game did have me stumped on more than a few occasions and I will admit have committed the sin of using a walkthrough to help me through a few of them (although all but one of them ended up being dev rooms), but after seeing the answers its clear that a player’s inability to proceed really does simply stem from their lack of ability to put pieces together rather than a negligence of giving you all the tools you need and teaching you how to use them—there are plenty of subtle, clever lessons leading up to larger problems, but it’s up to you to actually learn them and keep them in your head.\n\nOverall, I’d say my only big complaint with Antichamber is that there isn’t more of it. There’s no real extra content aside from the hidden dev rooms, and apart from restarting your save file to finish with a faster time there isn’t exactly much in the way of replay value, and asking for a sequel to a game like this in my opinion would be outrageous. Still, if Bruce does come up with something, I’d love to see it and will be the first in line to get it. :) This game is without a doubt one of the finest I’ve played and is an absolute must-have for puzzle game enthusiasts.","June 19, 2015","true","20.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The last part really doesn't deliver the same quality of level design as the first part and I really loved exploring the different rooms, but once you reach the exit stretch of the game that basically becomes irrelevant.\n\nStill, I highly enjoyed the game overall, the puzzles can be a bit of a brain twister at times, especially since a couple of times the solution, even if you've guessed it, lacks a clear definite response for the player. And it really helps that the aesthetic is so minimalist, while it is striking and at times quite beautiful to look at, it also manages to not take away the mind of the player from the puzzles.\n\nI think however that the game could've been better by actually having a plot. As it stands you're just trying to progress through the challenges you see not unlike Portal, but the difference there is that Portal actually told a story. Not just you being some lab-rat in a cage of an insane computer, it also uses its environments to flesh out the world this is taking place with scribbling on the walls and hints to what actually happened and how the weighted companion cubes are actually coffins for previous participants and scientists, etc. and there's nothing of that sort in Antichamber.\n\nAnd finally, I think $20 is a bit much to ask for this game. I get that trying to create a 3D representation of what a 4 dimensional world looks like does require some brainpower and talent to realize, but I've beaten the game in 3.5 hours which isn't much. I'm not saying that the game should've been longer, not at all, it's quite a good length although I've read that on subsequent playthroughs, the game takes less than a half hour to complete so it doesn't have replay value. I've bought it at the Humble Bundle for $0.50 and for that it's a steal, but I can't recommend it to others for the full price. If you can get it for $10 at a sale, that would be a fair price in my estimation.","March 31, 2014","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Things that you mother and father would tell you during the course of your life.\nI can say that this game is not really supposed to have a story, I could say that this is mostly a game to think to solve the puzzles, and maybe learn something which is going to be REALLY useful in your life, in a fun way, until you are able to finish your "quest" or as it can be seen in this game, your "life".\n\nGraphics: I'll say that the graphic is quite simple, but yet very attractive and colorful (I love colorful games!) in some parts, and the block gun look very interesting and ironically, reverses the conditions colors I like to use specially in survival games (Blue for perfect health, Green for little damage, yellow for medium damage and red for heavy damage), being the first on the blue and the last the Red gun, as a little downside, I think most of the corridors were a little lifeless, the walls were all white, it gives you a strange feeling of lolyness, maybe it was the intention of the game (9.5/10)\nStory: Like mentioned before, I believe this game wasn't really made to have a story, except for learning some meanings of life in a fun way, and the player (which the appearance is unknown) must pass the challenges in his "life", none of the happenings made any sense at all, like, why (s)he was there, who was (s)he, and what happened in the ending (I'll avoid making spoilers). The story didn't make much sense, so I'm afraid the story will get a so so rating, but hey! Just because the story is confusing somewhat doesn't mean the game is bad! (6/10)\nSound: Whoa, how I did like the sounds in the game, the sounds gave quite a good touch to the game, when you are falling at a very high speed, that good sound of the air passing on your ears, when you land, and the sounds of you moving, absorbing and firing the blocks, gave a great touch to the game, in any moment I never got tired of the sound effects, and the music was very calm, a perfect music to let the player think through the puzzles, I simply have nothing but good things to say about the sounds (10/10)\nDepth: Depending on how well can you think on the solution of the puzzles, the game can take quite a while to beat (I almost beat the game 100% in around 20 hours, being some of those hours idle), and having various different paths, including some deadends, if you are looking to explore everything in the game, it's going to take a while, if you are just aiming to find the exit, the game will be a bit shorter, looking at the map (there is a map of the rooms explored on the wall of the game start chamber), the game seems to have needed to have a few more rooms. (8/10)\nAddictiveness: Awesome, I can safely say that until I could find almost all the black signs (you can see all the black signs you found during the game on the game start chamber), I never got tired of the game, but after I've given up to find the last 5 black signs, I didn't really feel like playing again. (8/10)\nDifficulty: I can say that the difficulty is at it's exact point to the human mind, the challenges fits exactly accordingly to a smart person, I had to put a lot of thought through the challenges, to solve 'em, some were simple, and some you had to be more experienced and have more "Tools" to work them out.

The fact that I'm uncertain about that already tells you a whole lot about this game. In technical terms, one would describe it best as a first-person Metroidvania puzzler; but most conventional genre descriptors are far too generic for this convention-defier. If you love puzzles that are so headache-inducingly ingenious that the preposterous becomes intuitive, or if you just like to have your gray matter tickled, I'd definitely recommend this game.\n\nOne downside I'd note, though, is that - for some people, such as myself - the game is not only figuratively, but also literally headache-inducing. I'm not sure whether it's the brightness of the visuals, the ambient sound design, or what, but I found it difficult to play this game for extended stretches of time, which is a shame because the game is quite addicting!\n\nOh, I should also add, the game was very kindly gifted to me; I would not say it's worth its current price tag, though how long you'll be playing it will strongly depend on your wits and your willpower to resist looking up strategy guides.","December 20, 2014","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Without any narration, player development, or any real plot, it drew me in.  It makes you think more than most games would. The game is designed in such a way that most of the time you overthink the solution to things. The game holds your hand for the first little while and teaches you the basics, but then it throws you out. The ambience is a nice touch. It isn't just the same track throughout the whole game, it's different tracks in different parts of the game. The game is mostly non-linear and will frustrate you a lot. I would compare this game to the Stanley Parable and Portal, but a lot harder.\n\nThe only thing I would like to change would have some hints as to who and where I am.

It mostly deals with cube excursion and teaching lessons that do not alway follow the general laws of nature. The game is something that should be played by any puzzle game fan. It definitely makes you think and promotes the idea of anything is possible and just leaves you confused sometimes but that is why you are able to work at different locations of the place when you choose. It gives you a wide variety of puzzles as well as plenty of them to solve. The gameplay is solid and enjoyable, at least if you are not stuff on the same puzzle for a hour or more. The graphics are not amazing but that was openly expressed by the developers that they did not want to distract from the experience with fancy environments or graphics. Even without flashy effects and realistic atmosphere, the game still makes a fine puzzle game. I have had no trouble with any bugs or anything that break the game so it is good all around and I recommend it to puzzle video game fans mostly but still fun more most people I would say.","July 27, 2015","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toukotamago/recommended/219890/","toukotamago","a simple egg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toukotamago/","19 products in account","I don't think I've fallen in love with a game more instantaneously than I have with Antichamber. While I'm far from considering myself a "classic gamer", one thing I find a bit exasperating about almost all modern games is how they will persistently hold your hand in a manner that, even if it doesn’t remove the challenge entirely, certainly does a lot to insult your intelligence. You will not run into this problem in Antichamber, and this for me is its main charm. Much like the very first Legend of Zelda game, AC starts you out in an unknown, unexplained world and you have to learn the rules by yourself, some writing on the walls telling you how to control your newfound matter gun (which I didn't even find until maybe 2 hours in playing the game and honestly completely forgot about until I did) and upgrades the only real guides you'll be getting, aside from some delightful life lessons you only receive after completing the puzzles they refer to. The simple puzzles quickly become daunting and brain-teasing, though a small few can become a bit tedious (and one puzzle in particular, albeit optional and only leading to an extra dev room, is complete and utter BS). However, for the most part the game has an excellent track record of keeping your mind stimulated and providing many rewarding and even cathartic moments, and many puzzles are an absolute joy for me to replay over and over again.\n\nI also love the game’s minimalist presentation. You’ll be spending a lot of your time in pure white hallways, frequently visiting rooms that sport a color scheme ripped out of an MS Paint palette, but the game finds ways to use even its graphic simplicity to its advantage (many of the game’s puzzles and tricks wouldn’t work too well, I don’t think, in a more detailed aesthetic). I’ve seen people refer to the game as “ugly”, and while it certainly isn’t too easy on the eyes, it still finds ways to look just as charming as it plays.\n\nAt a glance, the game could easily be describled as "Portal with blocks” (even though development on this game started a year before Portal was released), but what sets it apart from its mad scientist peer more than anything is while Portal follows a very linear storyline, AC is completely open, nonlinear, and ready and waiting to have every conceivable corner explored—as soon as you figure out your way around. Another important difference that makes AC stand on its own is that where Portal’s theme is based around physics, science and strict logic, AC’s theme is its complete and utter deconstruction of your preconceptions of logic and reality, and while logic isn’t necessarily completely absent from the game, it has created its own, new set of rules that, again, you have to figure out for yourself.\n\nThis game did have me stumped on more than a few occasions and I will admit have committed the sin of using a walkthrough to help me through a few of them (although all but one of them ended up being dev rooms), but after seeing the answers its clear that a player’s inability to proceed really does simply stem from their lack of ability to put pieces together rather than a negligence of giving you all the tools you need and teaching you how to use them—there are plenty of subtle, clever lessons leading up to larger problems, but it’s up to you to actually learn them and keep them in your head.\n\nOverall, I’d say my only big complaint with Antichamber is that there isn’t more of it. There’s no real extra content aside from the hidden dev rooms, and apart from restarting your save file to finish with a faster time there isn’t exactly much in the way of replay value, and asking for a sequel to a game like this in my opinion would be outrageous. Still, if Bruce does come up with something, I’d love to see it and will be the first in line to get it. :) This game is without a doubt one of the finest I’ve played and is an absolute must-have for puzzle game enthusiasts.","June 19, 2015","true","20.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Antichamber is a puzzle game you'll be glad you played. You're alone, in this mesmerising but minimal world and it just feels so right. There's something healing, almost therapeutic about the combination of being secluded, the visuals and sounds with Antichamber. Everything is so fluid, atmospheric kind of timeless. That's even before we get to the mind warping beautifully created physics of the game.\n\nYou never stop learning new concepts in this game, even to the very end; it's a game that keeps giving but it's never too impossible, all puzzles can be done if you're willing to read the signs and listen to the game. It's almost as if Antichamber talks to you, and the game changes with your every move.

First thing I was told before I started playing it was: "Don't watch any videos on internet or anything about it, just play it with no expects" and so I did.\nIt has completely changed my point of view about videogames and their stories. It doesnt matter what your kind of games is, if you are a kid or an old man, you play Undertale or Call of Duty, or even Train Simulator, if you are open minded enough this game will just break it (your mind).\nIt is not a complex plot, indeed there is no other plot rather than your personal history and self evolution, maybe this was not the intention of the creator (maybe yes, indeed), but, at some point, antichamber changes your life. My only recomendation here is to play this game alone, with no hurry at all (with this I mean to play it when you plan to have a 2/3 hours gaming sesion), reading everything carefully and enjoying the visual experience. I haven't said anything about the game itself because I feel like I would be spoiling it.
