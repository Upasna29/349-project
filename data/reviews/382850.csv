Point Blank.\n\nPoint blank was a free shooter game.\nFrancisco and joao played point blank and they liked it.\nIt became their favourite game. They came from school everyday, start up skype, start up Point Blank and they played.\nThey were happy.\n\nBut something was wrong.\nThe weapons were horribly balanced, there were hackers everywhere, pay-to-win, you coudn't buy good weapons without real life money, weapons only lasted for 100 or 500 games (altough they were extremely expensive), some weapons only lasted for 30 days...\n\nBut Francisco and Joao were happy.\n\nBut it became worse. Weapons didn't last games... they lasted days... Francisco saw all the weapons he had bought with game money becoming near useless...all that grind...all those unfair deaths by wall/fast-knife/bomb hackers...\n\nFrancisco and joao stopped playing Point Blank.\n\nThe top 500 players were hackers.\n\nThe game was in the Brazilian instance, not american one.\n\n5 years later, Francisco (who had moved to France in the meanwhile) found a game on Steam store.\n\nThe carachter looked jsut like the terrorrist guy on Point Blank.\n\n"Wait a minute" he said... Point Blank=PB. Piercing Blow=PB\n\nSo Francisco download the piece of ♥♥♥♥, wrote a review telling his own story and unnistaled the game.\nHe had to warn others of scammers devellopers and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games.\n\n\n\nPros:\n\nI haven't really played it here, but i played it before (nearly 800 hours) so the felling is good.\nSlightly good graphics... for 2010.\nDinossaurs, i think. There were dinossaurs in the old game so i think there are here.\nA good variety of weapons (altought many are the same, only different skins and stats)\n\nCons:\nHackers\nUnfriendly community.\nPay to win garbage\nBad interface\nBad devellopers\nThe devellopers are so ashamed of Point Blank, they just renamed it.\nBad story, really. Point Blank was just freedom fighters against swat, it was simple and awesome. This is just "racism here, racism there, blaaa blaaa blaaa, FREEDOOOOOM"\nBad physics\nAn overrall ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.\nThis game is nothing but a copy of Point Blank, but they knew we already hated Point Blank because it became an uselless Pay-to win fillled with hackers, bad graphics, and of course unballlenced weapons (AUG i'm looking at you, you sexy ♥♥♥♥♥).\nAn overrall rather good game for 2010, but now it's aged.\n\n\n2/10 only because of nostalgia\n\n\nEdit:\n\nI actually just saw the story...Omg.\nIt's...it's...it's ♥♥♥♥!!\nLOL\n\nThe terrorist want to attain their needs? WHAT ♥♥♥♥ING NEEDS?\n\nYou tried to do a story Zepetto, but now we can see that it was made by a 12 year old call of duty fan.\n\nGG you stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\n\nSecond edit:\n\nFrancisco has recovered from his sickness due to having played 8 minutes of this steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nHe is now well and playing good games...*whispers...Mount and blade....end whisper*.\n\n\nPs: to those who didn't understood. I am Francisco. Point Blank used to be my childhood. No longer.\n\n♥♥♥♥ Piercing Blow, ♥♥♥♥ Point Blank, last but not least ♥♥♥♥ PROJECT BLACKOUT!!\n\n\nThanks to faridschreuder to reminding me of Project Blackout.\n\nAnd thank you all for the 114/124 usefull and 73 who find it funny. Francisco and Joao have moved on from ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games...and they love you all.\nPeace.\n\nSo many people comment here, and SO MANY thought this was funny. Lol, just a little life experience on a steam review can be funny... Well, thank you for those who found this review helpful.\n\nKnow that EVERYTHING i've written here is true, this game is the exact same as Point blank, only EVEN WORSE than the other.","November 15, 2015","false","0.1"," 2,100 of 2,238 people (94%) found this review helpful 1,746 people found this review funny","94","100","2","746","114"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/johncarver/recommended/382850/","johncarver","John","http://steamcommunity.com/id/johncarver/","40 products in account","The game, when you first look at it, looks like your generic FPS with subpar graphics and near CounterStrike-like mechanics. However, when you actually get your hands on the game, you find that it's something all together different.\n\nSomething all together worse than you thought. Man, is this game a mess.\n\nLet's weigh the pro's and con's.\n\nPro's\n*Game is very quick to download, and likely will uninstall even faster.\n*Controls are solid, and almost identical to CounterStrike, with the exception of ADS (Aiming down the sights)\n*Game is rather easy to run, even on a mediocre setup, even though the game defaults to extremely low from the start.\n*Game has a Bot fighting mode, which allows you to get away from the game's horrid community.\n*The Knife Fight game mode is actually the game's strong point, where it is likely to be the only mode you'll have fun in.\n\nCon's\n*Game is very hit-or-miss on start-up. It will either force feed you an error, or give you a blank black screen until you close out of it and try again. Even then, it will take a few moments to get the game running to your correct resolution, and graphical choice.\n*Overall gameplay is absolutely abysmal, and barely functioning.\n*Gunplay feels like it's trying so desperately to be just like CounterStrike, but trying to force in elements of Call of Duty by giving the false hope of aiming down the sights of your weapons (when and only when they have scopes). In reality, it's still random if the guns will even work at all. This, topped with the fact that all guns are one-shot-kill to the head, makes for a frustrating experience no matter what map you're on, or what weapon you use.\n*The maps on the game are uninspired and boring. All that really sticks out is whether they're symetrical, or asymetrcial.\n*The game's overall server stability is shoddy at best. You'll be falling in and out of games.\n*The spawning in this game is horrible. No matter what game mode you play, you will either be camping the enemy spawn, or are in the process of being spawn-camped, yourself. This, coupled with extraordinarily long respawn times, makes for an utterly keyboard-breakingly terrible time.\n*The game's community, small as it is, is mainly dominated with young children who likely downloaded the game simply because it had female soldiers in it that you can make wear bikinis, and their constant bickering in the chat boxes in game will remind you frequently to their presence. This game suffers from the same "Spam GO GO GO as soon as you enter a game lobby" problem that the late FEAR Online did, and lobbies will next to always clear out as soon as the game ends.\n*As this is a small community, you will find yourself being bombarded relentlessly with invites to join rooms. There is no way, as far as I know, to stop this and it will weigh on your nerves very quickly.\n*NOTHING, and I will repeat, NOTHING in this game is permanent. At all. All weapons, costumes, add ons, power ups, and everything in between have very strict pay walls that, at best, go up to 30 days. You will have to constantly empty your wallet into this game if you even HOPE to survive in the game modes, as all of the starter weapons and free weapons are utter garbage. That's if you're stupid enough to pour any type of money into this game at all.\n*Game is very ugly. Murky textures, and bland colors really make this game look terrible.\n*Game is POORLY moderated. As a result, you will frequently run into hackers and people exploiting the game's horrible engine.\n\nAll in all, this is a rushed mess; simply a clone of Garena's Point Blank 2 slapped onto Steam with a new (and even more ridiculous) name, and littered to the brim with so many pay walls and Pay-to-Win aspects, that Aeria Games would question their design choices.\n\nUnless you're masochistic, I'd suggest staying away from this cashgrab.","November 22, 2015","false","6.9"," 365 of 409 people (89%) found this review helpful 106 people found this review funny","89","365","409","106","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/misterff1/recommended/382850/","misterff1","Misterff1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/misterff1/","165 products in account","Piercing Blow: Broken edition\nEver wanted a Counter Strike type of game that’s completely broken? Neither did I, but Zepetto Corporation decided the world needed another cluster♥♥♥♥ in the ever expanding library of broken videogames. Prepare for a rant, because you’re going to get one…\n\n\n\nFirst Second run\nOh the first run of this game… I am not the type of person to cry, but I felt the urge to do just that this time. I think it’s best to explain this by telling you the first ten minutes I experienced with this game:\n\nWhen I started the game for the first time, I got a black screen. The music started to play and I knew that the menu was actually loaded because of the sounds. So I decided to hit enter twice and guess what? That closes the game. I should have kept it closed, but I decided to give it another try and oh joy, it worked this time....in 4:3 screen format.\n\nNow when I see a game do that, I immediately search for a settings button so I can rectify this and immediately tweak the rest of the graphical settings. But hey, why add such a button when you are in the first menu? Nah, I first needed to join a channel before I was even able to set a nickname and select a character. Still no settings button to be found.\n\nSo I selected a character, selected a gun type called ‘machine’, (because apparently that’s a gun type now) and created the character. But no no no, the game didn’t want me to use a ‘machine’ and decided to give me an assault rifle instead.\n\nThankfully there was a settings button now, so I figured I was past the worst part. I was not. When opening the settings I immediately noticed that you need to restart the game for more than half of the settings in that menu! Luckily the developers were so kind to leave out half of the important stuff so I did not have to bother with more than 15 popups saying I needed to restart. Thank you developers, that’s very kind of you /s.\n\nSo after all this time, all I achieved was getting a nickname (for which you are required to manually click the namecheck button somehow), creating a character that was not even the same as what I got after I created it and changing my resolution and some other settings. Remember I said ten minutes? That was ten minutes.\n\nAre you crying yet? No? Let me tell you a little story about gameplay then…\n\n\n\nGameplay\nAfter clicking through a couple of floating coins and ignoring 17000 join requests (thanks again devs, I really like that you added a random invite button there), I finally got into a game. And boy is it broken.\n\nWhen playing a match in this game, you will immediately notice similarities with Counter Strike and that should be a good thing. Except it is not anywhere near as good as CS. The game types are pretty similar and when you are dead, you need to wait until the next round. That much is okay about this game. What is not is the fact that it is unbalanced as hell! Sure, there is some kind of hack detection present in the game, but since some weapons are extremely OP, you can expect lots of kiddies whining about HAXXX nonetheless. Oh and when you áre able to respawn, you can expect the entire enemy team to be standing at your spawn point, ready to blow your head off after you lose invulnerability.\n\nI don’t think I even need to go any further on that subject as this should basically be enough to stop you from playing it already.\n\n\n\nMicro transactions\nWhile I am not a fan of this system, I normally accept the fact that it is present in a Free2Play title. Developers have to earn their money some way, right?\n\nWhile this game does not really have ridiculously high prices for their micro transactions, they stuff you buy with it is extremely pricey which means you have to buy a lot stuff anyway. Well, technically the items are not that pricey, but if you have to rebuy them EVERY 24 HOURS that’s still going to suck up all the coins you bought in no time.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nI have seen some bad videogames over the years now, but this one is really somewhere on the top of that list. The developers claim it won some prices in Thailand for Best Casual Game in 2011 and say that the world ‘raves about this game’, but obviously that’s just fake. This game is a complete cluster♥♥♥♥ that starts making you angry before you even enter your first match.\n\nWhile the game does seem very well optimized and is functional in some areas, it screws up on so many levels that I cannot possible give this a rating higher than a\n\n2/10\n\nPlease, if you install this game, only install it so you can hit the uninstall button. That’s the only satisfying experience you will get from it.","November 24, 2015","false","1.5"," 144 of 161 people (89%) found this review helpful 76 people found this review funny","89","144","161","76","5"

The recoil patterns are there, the footsteps and walk is there. However, snipers aren't even accurate, headshots deal little damage, you CANNOT perma any guns whatsoever is horrendous, and the recoil is just messed up.\nFirst off, you have around a 50% chance to shoot the guy you're scoped in at and this is while you are standing STILL. Second, the headshots seem like they barely do damage. It's probably because of the helmet but if that's the case then the hitbox for that thing is pretty big.\nThird, you are unable to perma any guns. At all. You can only rent and quantity buy. Quantity buy is where you buy a set quantity, say 100, and every time you finish a game using that gun, the quantity goes down by 1. Eventually, you run out of guns to use and get back to using the default guns.\nFinally, recoil. Long story short, the SMG and AR have more recoil than a LMG. Go figure.\n\ntldr: Don't download this. The 1.6 gb that this game takes up is better suited for your porn collection.\n\nUpdate #1: Changed description of how quantity weapons work. I had it wrong. It goes down by game not death.","November 10, 2015","false","0.7"," 196 of 256 people (77%) found this review helpful 97 people found this review funny","77","196","256","97","22"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OhioNitsud/recommended/382850/","OhioNitsud","Nitsud (Rebuilding PC)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OhioNitsud/","136 products in account","Quite possibly one of the worst F2P shooters ever in the planet. I don't think it's 100% P2W because you still have a slight chance to kill the veterans who have better guns, especially during an event where they give you a ton of items to try for free and tens of thousands of points to use (the nonpremium currency). I can see why people call it a CS clone but it's your typical cheap-looking, F2P shooter more than anything else. The loose aiming, slow and limited movement and the dated graphics, how the menus look are all what you'd expect.\n\nA few things I especially didn't like about the game: both teams can freely walk into each others spawn. There is no barrier to keep each other out so eventually every TDM comes down to which team can push up and abuse each others spawn the most. With each life you are given a limited amount of ammo for your primary gun. There is no buy or refill ammo. Once your out, you gotta rely on your secondary or melee. I've seen a couple dudes exploiting maps to have cover that makes them invincible. I dare not to go into some servers called, "Teh hak is bak" or "Hacker is on!!!". They could be just trolling or it could be true. I don't want to find out.\n\nI can't recommend this game at all. There's so many better shooters released nowadays that a game like this should be last on your list. Only give this a try if you're extremely bored, curious or like to watch train wrecks.","November 13, 2015","false","4.2"," 103 of 128 people (80%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","80","103","128","10","0"

After playing crossfire many years back I said screw it and gave this game a shot. What happened in this hour? 3 game crashes, and the game didn't manage to capture my attention as I played it. Little maps, and servers for new players are low at the moment so you have to play against higher ranked people who are much better. That's not bad considering the fact that it's my fault for playing there but you do get stomped. Also, almost all the guns are bought with an ingame currency which is bought with real money. To make a good game you want more guns with actual currency you can earn, not buy. That leads to the pay 2 win thought and makes the game crumble.

But let's get to the pros and cons of this game\n\nPros:\n-Easy to run, don't need a high end computer\n-Easy game, honestly all you need is a fast firing smg and steady hands. This game is easier to RNG than CoD\n-Can pick up weapons, YES finally they added that option. It used to be that you couldn't pick up enemy team's weapons. Now you can. So just camp and kill some casher, take his weapon and enjoy\n-That's about it\n\nCons:\n-Extrememly Pay2Win, okay yes it's a easy game but the option of guns that you don't need to grind for days unlocking and doesn't require real money are either slow firing high damage or fast firing low damage. Basically they're all pretty ♥♥♥♥. You need to cash in some decent amount of money to get a good gun (Aug)\n-Guns are not Permanant. Okay if I am going to cash in this game at least make the guns permanant. But no, instead, you get quantities or days.\n-♥♥♥♥ Developers. Cmon, all you guys did was change the name from Project Blackout to Piercing Blow. There's no change to game mechanics or shop. All they do is add variants of weapons and make it more expensive. Added camo and "increased accuracy"? +10000 points to buy!\n-♥♥♥♥ GMs. This should be a Pro. It is so easy to wallhack in this game without getting caught (I would know, I wallhacked for 5 months and I am still not banned, Sue me ♥♥♥♥)\n-Hackers everywhere, AY YOU GOT ME LMAO\n-Toxic community, during the time I was playing this long enough to write a review, there's one game where I planted the bomb, jumped out of the window and headshotted someone. Proceed to get raged on by some kid who doesn't even speak English\n-Not Optimized, You know how I said it is easy to run? Yeah it is, just put everything on low and you should be good. I used to play this on my laptop with IntelHD3000 graphics. But I was fps lagging when I was playing on 1920 on my current PC.\n\nOverall this game is only fun to play when you have good guns, It's a shame that there are no good guns purchasable using Points (in game currency). It's not a hard game.","December 13, 2015","false","0.7"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","30","36","2","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strykaz/recommended/382850/","strykaz","Phaze","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strykaz/","30 products in account","Just to clarify on some of the previous reviews.\n\nTL;DR: This game used to be reasonable and fun, now it's an example of how a Snowball can catch a lot of dirt on its way down the hills.\n\nThe invites: You can disable game invites entirely, or leave them only enabled for Friends and Clan.\n\nThe game: It's not a copy of Garena's Point Blank. This IS Point Blank. This version of Piercing Blow (oh, I witnessed the name change and I died) is actually Project\n\nBlackout, formerly published by GameRage, who weren't getting enough profit from the game, and dropped it (after all, it IS a huge money-grab). The new managers decided to\n\ninclude this same update that the Garena managers did, with all the class/outfit bullcrap, rather than the old inventory, perk and leveling system PB had, which was, in fact,\n\nmuch better.\n\nNow here's a few fun facts:\n\nThe maps: They (at least some) are "blatantly disguised" copies of Counter-Strike maps. For example: Look at Downtown and try to compare it to Dust2. Small houses making\n\ntunnels into B, a CT base going under A(bombsites have been switched when comparing to Dust2, though), a straight passageway right into mid that can make sniper battles from\n\nbase to base. Pretty much a "city" themed Dust2.\n\nCash-shop: It used to be much worse, but better at the same time. You used to have items like Quick-Swap, Quick-Reload, Less Respawn Time, XP/Money boosters that boosted\n\ndifferent ammounts depending on how much you paid, characters that would boost XP, Credits or Mobility and HP, you could not get any of the ridiculously skinny female\n\ncharacters without paying (though you could get the default female characters, which are much skinnier than the default fat guy), the masks (which give ridiculous stats like\n\nan almost guaranteed second chance after being shot in the head, or more penetration to cancel that second chance).\n\nThe servers: They have been horrible for as long as I can remember. Not even back in GameRage do I recall having stable connections (Oh, but I can play on Russian, Arab and\n\nLatino-American servers with barely any lag) and all my friends suffered from the same.\nThe game's always been Pay2Win, but after the transition to this "PB Extreme" game-revamp, which, in fact, was a complete throw-up, the gameplay itself went down a lot.\n\nI used to have fun in this game with friends. We used to have fun to a point where one of my friends got a REALLY high-ranked account and got banned for "hacking". He decided\n\nhe didn't want to stop playing, so he started over, and he got banned AGAIN for "hacking". The game is too "community-managed", to the point where too much reports will get\n\nyou banned for allegedly hacking, even if you're active in the forums, constantly posting videos of cool plays you do. It's ALWAYS been this way.\n\nI am not going to lie, I believe this game has potential as a fun Free-To-Play game, but, even though I've moved onto other games, if I ever play it again, I'll tell you\n\nright now: I'll be playing on a server other than Piercing Blow. The old Point Blank/Project Blackout with the old level skills and old shop is much better, not to mention\n\nthat there are a few PB's where you actually can get GOOD permanent weapons without having to spend a single penny.\n\nAll in all, this all just means I'm extremely sad because of how this game went downhill in such a shameless way. After all, this game was one of the reasons I have some of\n\nthe best friends I could ask for.\n\n*Phew* /rant over, sorry for the wall of text.","November 22, 2015","false","0.3"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","14","18","4","0"

Here are my pros and cons:\n\nPro:\n\n- really nice weapon physics (you feel the power!)\n- iron sight aiming\n- accolades - lots of them: headshot, double kill. ...\n- fast and addictive gameplay\n- gore! - you really see your enemy bleeding loads while being shot\n- headshots are one shot kills no matter what weapon you use (helmet protection can sometimes help you survive)\n- interactive maps - some walls even break from shots\n- community  is friendly and uses the chat\n- low system recommendation\n- weapon variety\n- as far as I experienced it is a balanced game\n\nCon:\n\n- to much restrictions for free users - no grenade launchers, some weapons are only obtainable via cash shop\n- rediculous looking premium characters that mess up the concept  of the game - semi nude women, men in underwear ...\n- bugs, mostly with the Interface\n- to much content that boosts you besides your skills - not just cosmetic parts\n- could simply turn to yet another p2w title n\n\nI wouldn't say that it's a p2w game right now but its on the edge to become one. If the devs won't make any steps towards  a fair gameplay I think this game will be dead before it really was alive here on Steam. Best wishes to the Team and Google luck with your release. Here is my thumbs up which could easily turn into a dislike if the cash shop will ruin the game.","November 14, 2015","true","6.8"," 76 of 144 people (53%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","53","76","144","9","4"

It's like finding your toilet door is locked so you go to another toilet somewhere in your house, even though you know that the outcome is just gonna be ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥, waiting to be flushed away forever so that you'll completly forget about it. So after unlocking this ♥♥♥♥ from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that conceals it, I started playing the "game". As soon as I began, the first words I uttered whilst looking at the screen were, "What the ♥♥♥♥ do I do now?". Eventually, the "game" asked me to create a nickname, which was made by smashing my hand on the keyboard, and thus the real "game" started with me turning the horrid music to mute. I tried to join a match, but this game has one of my least favourite things in any disfunctional game, a ready option... I have no problem when this is done well; in this "game" it wasn't at all... During the time I spent waiting it said that most of the people were ready, but some were "setting" or some ♥♥♥♥, WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?!?!?!?!?! Anyways, long ♥♥♥♥♥♥ match short, only remember dying and that the only weapon I got kills with was my secondary weapon(AKA, the pistol), I did what everyone else did after playing this ♥♥♥♥... Uninstalled it.\n1.5/10, the 0.5 is for the fact it's free and the 1 is for the fun in unstalling it.\n♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME!!!\nP.S.

I launched the game and it would tab out and all there would be left of the game is a box with a progress bar on it and two words saying, "Please Wait..." And the game would crash after about 30 seconds, I was not able to run this game, I don't know if it's my PC specs or what, I don't believe it would be that, mainly because I have a phenom quad core processor, a 650 TI graphics card, and a 3 TB hard drive, so I don't think it's my specs as ♥♥♥♥ as they are. Because the recommended settings aren't even that high, my biggest problem with the game though, is that I couldn't go into the shop, the settings, or anything like that, I even tried rushing making a character to get into a server, I wasn't fast enough because when I tried to type I immediately got the box saying, "Please Wait..." And then a message from my computer saying the game has crashed and it would like to terminate the process.

The pay2win features have been dialed down massively\n\nPreviously the quantity system was a massive issue like seriously it was only 100 lifes. Now its 100 matches, meaning you will enjoy your gun for around 1000times longer then before. Its a lot better then when i last played it thats for sure.\n\nchallenges are generous and each level gives you a lot of stuff. Basically within around 20-30minutes of gameplay you will have enough gear to last 60-90days depending on your skill.\n\nEvery weapon can either be brought with points or real money and you get more money per match now so its a reasonable chance that you will neevr run out of weapons like you did back in the day.\n\nIts got dated graphics, very dated but that means i get 1000fps at 4k which is hilarious.\n\nIf you download via steam then you get 30days free OP weapons for every class so you can match the vets of the game out of the bat.\n\n\nIts stable and i think ill enjoy it for a few more hours.\n\nthe 10 year old me back in the day played this back with the x1300 pro.\n\nThe 18 year old me is back with a gtx 680 still living in the past to live the old days.\n\nIts a lot of fun so its worth a shot, not sure why this has so much hate on it, its a lot better then majority of the free2play games on steam.\n","November 11, 2015","true","4.0"," 50 of 100 people (50%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","50","50","100","12","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatCrazyGuyNT/recommended/382850/","ThatCrazyGuyNT","ThatCrazyGuy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatCrazyGuyNT/","181 products in account","Piercing Blow (PB) is one of the latest free to play FPS games to be released to the Steam store. It's already gathered a large amount of negative reviews and after playing the game for less than 20 minutes I could already see why.\n\nLet's begin with the main menu. The menu you are greeted with is very minimalist which in most cases is usually a good thing and generally makes the game more user-friendly, but in the case of PB less is not good. From the main menu screen you can see your stats (such as kills, deaths, wins and losses), you can a access a browser that allows you to join open channels for matches in game and you can shut down you game. That's it for the main menu. One glaring issue is the lack of an options menu for changing your video, audio, control and general games settings. This should not be an issue even in a free to play title such as PB, also a large amount of the options on the main menu are blocked and in accessible to the user. These options become accessible once you select a channel to join along with the games options menu. One question that needs to be asked is “Why aren't these options available to us on the main menu?” Especially the game’s options menu. The options provided in the main menu are reasonable for a free to play game.\n\nNow that the main menu is covered let's move onto the gameplay. The gameplay wasn't as bad as I expected it be. The controls were easy to use. It feels like a FPS and plays like one it's just when I play it I can't help but feel like I've seen it before. It's pretty clear from the way the levels and some of the gamemodes are designed that this game took alot of inspiration from Counter-Strike Source, however it seems like PB is just a free to play clone of CS:S and not a unique title.\n\nAnother point that needs to be addressed is the inventory menu. At least from my experience this menu is very glitchy and I found myself stuck in the menu alot without any way of getting out. Also when I open up the game after shutting it down for some reason my loadout reverts to the default and I have to reequip my weapons all over again.\n\nThroughout the review I have not mentioned the games graphics yet, this is because the game was originally released in 2007 and since then there have been many improvements in the way graphics have been designed it would be unfair to judge it based on today’s standards. However for a game that was released 3 years after CS:S I have to say the graphics look worse than the graphics in CS:S. It seems that the only parts of the game that are designed well from a graphical standpoint are the character models and weapons. I would have expected the game to have had decent map textures for a game released in 2007 and just shows how little attention to detail the developers had for the games graphics.\n\nOverall, this game looks like it was put on steam as a re-release to help boost the game’s player population, but has very few unique qualities that would make it an entertaining FPS. The game borrows a lot of ideas from Counter Strike: Source, but does not develop upon these ideas at all. Piercing Blow is a very good example what a free to play FPS should not be like and the developers should learn from the mistakes made with this game.\n\n(Since I’ve only played the game for a short amount of time some aspects of the game may have been missed out. I will add to this review at a later date.)","November 30, 2015","false","0.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","3"

Hit register never fails. If you didn't get the shot you missed.. period.\n2. Doesn't take a lot of time to get in to the groove of the game, but mastering it takes much longer.\n3. Can run on low-end (2011-2012 amd/nvidia chipsets ) PC's perfectly on high/medium settings.\n4. There is always some kind of event or give away.\n5. As you rank up, you receive items to help you throughout your experience.\n6. There is missions/quests to help you rank up faster, so less time worrying about how low your rank is.\n7. Built-in enhancement system for your character(s) (You can pick more than one character). These enhancements are class-chosen (Assault Rifler, SMG, Sniper) and so on. The enhancements are things like accuracy, firing your gun faster, reloading faster, throwing grenades farther, so on.\n8. A fresh experience for a player who has played common FPS's.\n9. It has a tutorial that gives you free in-game points.\n\nCons\n1. Poor in-game recording tool. You will be better off using tools like Fraps and ShadowPlay.\n2. Slightly P2W, but you can easily destroy enemies who have equipped pay-to-win items.\n3. The game mechanics a majority of the time are highly unrealistic, compared to games like CS:GO. Please don't say this game is a copy of CS:GO, dear god it was released 5 years before GO.\n4. Extremely limited PVE mode. It is a deathmatch mode where you can go up to vs. 8 bots, and the more kills you get, the higher their difficulty increases.\n5. The weapons are not permanent in any way. There is quanity (guns purchased with points) and days (equipment purchased with points/ real money or guns purchased with real money). The default set options for these gun purchases I believe are 1 day, 3 days, and 1 month. You can buy more days, but these are the defaults.","November 10, 2015","true","3.0"," 53 of 109 people (49%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","49","53","109","12","5"

You won't see EXTREAME DETAIL AND THICK SHADOW RENDERING here!\n\nLots of appearance customization, and a lot of the in-game items last for a few days or uses. I wore a bikini to a firefight lol\n\nI wouldn't play this competitively, although I've read that actual competitions done in-game has a different set of rules. I would play this with friends and talk trash lol\n\nAlso in the options you can change how you hold your weapon (right or left handed), for any lefties!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordUlric/recommended/382850/","LordUlric","MOD_Ulric","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordUlric/","41 products in account","So ,  alot of player is giving this game a bad review such as if the game it self is new. I will clearn some facts\n\nQ: is the game pay to win?\nA: No , it truly is not  we have point guns that match the cash gun as well as simaller  gear to that of cash gear mainly to help support the game and its funding is which  is main reasoning behind  the fact their is premium gear.\n\nQ: Can yo prove this  is not  Pay to win ? Show some gameplay of point gear\nA: Sure cause im constantly streaming point gear occasionally use cash items for   goofing off :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuniojYOh-Q   42-16 with the f2000 reload which is a point gun also  one the least accurate assult riffles and under powered assult riffles in the game.\nHere is also a game where i  go 35-9 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fixP6IcA5RU\noh just so can see the gm weho cash stacks here is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DajqU_44L7s  i went 12-4 in this match.\n\n\nQ: Why are GM's and moderators  inactive !\nA: I do not know why players say this i am constantly online usually round  7-8 hours a day  sometimes even longer ! Due to my insomnia  i do not sleep so i spend a high amount of time   going from room to room pubing and checking on players,  even recently did a  26 hour live stream !!!! for my first   24 horu stream ever on my twice and chose  pb for my game of choice !!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\nQ: You do this review cause you are paid  huh ?\nA: Acutally moderators are not paid,  truly we donate our time and service  to the community naturally i would not turn away donations on my stream tho! :D\n\n\nQ: OMFG BAN THE LAGGERS !?\nA: We do have a region lock in effect and sadly some players use VPNS cause they love our game so much they wish to continue to play ! Yes i know i hate being lag shot  also but truly you will run into laggers in all games online period console or pc regardless!\n\nQ: why did you rip off counter strike\nA:  Well  they didn't,   just  look up all fps in  era of 2000-2005 and compare truly all fps  are comparably the same !\n\n\nQ: THE GAME IS OVER HACKED!!!!!!!!!!!\nA: Compared to what? Honestly please link me any free to play shooter game without  a hack community clearly you are new to gaming i am very sorry tho i do try my best to capture each and every hacker to ban list along with the GM team ! We do our best and sadly cheating is a life style which is in  high demand of children for all games not only the pointblank/piercing blow franchise :(\n\nQ: Why does the graphics look so bad?\nA: Cause the game play is great and solid in terms of controls and way it feels in all modes the game is also running on dx9 as it is about  8 years old if not mistaken XD\n\n\n\nI have been playing this game for over a year now i have become a community  moderator i have seen all the  ins and out of this game  i have made many friends and  endured many headaches from this game truly tho i always come back cause i personally enjoy the game.  Sadly many are miss informed on the hack issue as it is about the same as any free to play fps on the market currently as well as laggers are the norm in online gaming.  All though i think some things would be better handled another way the game is truly not broken and  it has not died the community is very  active!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nNot to mention also the gms run constant e vents login bonus so even if you can not afford cash you will get cash  gear to have fun with.  For the competitive gamers  out there   we do have a national and international tournament !!!!! we also do monthly online tournaments  to   earn   large sums of cash in game and even 5,000 in game cash for simply playing even if you lose !\n\nI would recommend this game which is why i stream it and have recommended to many friends who have downloaded , play and enjoy the game very much so. Oh also before anyone says   i simply  have nothing els to play i still chose this compaird to my main  games\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EFdE2PeX-U\n\nas you can see , surly this game has alot to offer  as you can tell by my selection of games *slightly outdated invatory is  3 weeks old lol*\n\nAlso  you can see i chose to use points over cash in game  when you review my invatory  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2N5H1CoeiFc   i have lots of cash guns i simply choose not to use them :)\n\nAll i have to say  is   if you wanna go by a review and toss a good game up when you have chance to build many friends and join a nice community outside of the trolls  which all games have then your really gana miss out ! Not many games have mods and gms as active as this game or as devoted truly. Anyways im going to resume my stream<3 ill post some psg1   videos  later to show  sniper games are not pay to win as well :D  I do hope many of you find this   helpfull , also if anyone needs help whisper me in game MOD_Ulric  :)  HAVE A GREAT DAY ALL AND GOOD LUCK IN YOUR GAME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\n-Mod_Ulric","November 28, 2015","true","19.8"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","1"

I think that they think that it is supposed to be realistic, but It's not.\nIt's just a game to play when you are bored and you don't feel like playing anything else.\nI personally like the games feel. I think that it is pretty evenly balanced and all in all a pretty good game for a free to play game.","November 18, 2015","true","0.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

For being a free to play game it will have to somewhat rely on in-game currency that u can buy so that they can afford to run the servers. This game has been shutdown several times and relaunched due to popular demand, i know that since i have been a player of this community for a while now.\nThe game features a lot of similarities to CS in its mechanics, but the game feels and flows the same way as a CoD game would. It is fast paced.\nThe weapon system features a method of buying a weapon for a set amount of time (10-90 days), which i udnerstand considering they are f2p and need something to offer besides cosmetics to get some extra revenue. this does not interrupt the gameplay in my opinion since if you play enough (as i have) you will afford several weapon when your original weapon "runs out". The mechanic of buying weapons on a set amount of time might be discouraging, but if you play the game you will earn enough to buy it again. It isnt pay to win.\nAll in all this is a good game that is free to play and runs well on a low budget PC.","March 3","true","8.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Besides CS GO and TF2 being one of my top FPS games on the computer, I think that Piercing Blow made its way up and is starter to tower TF2 and CS GO. The fun fast paced aspect and the characterization added into it changes the whole gameplay and well the whole game overall. Out of 5 stars I would give it a 4. I know it sounds like im drooling over the game, but in reality im not. There some things I would like to change. The maps are some what annoying to play on. A lot of them are small and complex. As soon as you turn your back you are either dead or down to 15 HP. Alos the starting guns are extremely annoying to get the hang of. The recoil and damage are way to out of placed. The damage can be extremely low and the recoil can be too high. But overall the game is really good and is highly recommended!","November 24, 2015","true","9.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

And here some hints:\n○ Once account created you cannot change it. Make it unique, so when making a 'chain killer', opponents remember your nick.\n○ Keep your cash/money balanced never spend' em all. (you start with 50 000).\n○ The fastest way earn money and skill - just go to novice server (for beginners) and will gain much exp.

I recommend this game to anyone who wants to have fun and also play competitive, Zepetto host a Online tournament every month which you can win In-game cash to buy the better weapons,skins,helments and much more! you can also cash if you wish. Alot of people say this game is cash to win, it is not! if you have the skill to headline then you do not need to cash, Cash is a luxery for the game if you want to be one up on most players it is not mandatory! Soon as you complete the Weapon missons you can buy a AUG A3 ,P90 Ext,L115A1 Ext for points to use! yes it dosen't have as much bullets as the cash version but it still does the job!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tjGROOVe/recommended/382850/","tjGROOVe","man poops in vietnams only sink","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tjGROOVe/","80 products in account","This is an old(ish) free to play game that went by multiple names, I knew this game as Project Blackout, that was its name in North America almost over six years ago. Back in Korea, its place of conception, this was known as Point Blank. Reception to the game was relatively warm.\n\nI can tell you why it received some warm thoughts back then, and that's because the guns were varied, the character models were surprisingly detailed at the time; and the maps had some interesting gimmicks going on. We had toasters at the time and we didn't have to bug our parents to buy the game for us.\n\nOther free-to-play games at the time were Crossfire, Soldier Front and WolfTeam. But Project Blackout/Piercing Blow was a lot slicker in its presentation.\n\nPiercing Blow and the games that I mentioned are all F2P Korean FPSes. They were all developed on the cheap, they were cheap for the consumer, and the publishers got signifigant returns. They sought to mimic popular titles and in this case it was Counter-Strike 1.6 and Source. You had to pay for those games. In some parts of the world, this wasn't an option - especially in South America and other places where games are a massive luxury. Thanks for to free to play games, they were offered an alternative. For a game to be successful in Korea, it had to be free, so don't confuse this for them trying to directly advertise towards anybody else.\n\nAnd that's partially why these games are dying, CS 1.6 and Source are considered relics and tastes have changed. Kids don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about Source, and they sure as hell won't touch 1.6.\n\nKorean free-to-play shooters aren't doing very well and this is all thanks to fatigue given to us by AAA publishers. If its not the fatigue that bothers the casual player, then it might be the dated presentation that this game now has to offer. If you look at the other reviews, most of them will mention its graphics - blissfully unaware of the game's age and overall purpose.\n\nMainstream tastes generally forecast the future of these games. If the forecast is bleak, then you're in trouble. It's simply the dangerous life of riding off of the coattails. If the person wearing the coat dies, then those on the coattails have no success to ride off of.\n\nRegardless, A game that's free to play is pretty hard to make money off of without being creative. Especially if its older and lacks the refinement of big-budget free to play games today, so its only natural that the game is pay-to-win. At one point, when the game was named Project Blackout, this wasn't a huge problem. Now, its a game-breaking issue.\n\nWeapon synergy is dead in this game, back in the day, you'd actually see people with Sniper Rifles doing their thing, and shotguns were an often occurance. But now, you only see people with Golden P90s. Premium SMGs have godlike spread and accuracy with a seemingly never ending magazine. If you want to win, then pull out your credit card and buy yourself a golden P90. If you're not gonna buy a P90, then don't expect to win confrontations very often.\n\nThe game has little to no lag compensation, so because of this the player is forced to lead their shots. But what really sucks is the fact that there's no numerical latency values, so you can never be too sure of how far you should shoot ahead. (if you're dealing with a person that has 500ms of lag, you'll know to aim around a half of a second ahead.) I can't really blame the game for this, because it has no control over who decides to pick up and play. Unless they decide to do an IP block against South American nations (which a game actually decided to do, I just forgot which one.)\n\nOccasionally, fun can be had, but its often shortlived. What we're seeing is a Korean Free-to-play game at its end of life/endgame, festering to the brim with guns that have tattoo art (actually not far off from CSGO, although F2p games have been doing skins of guns for way longer); golden guns having statistical advantages over their non-shiny counter parts; and cosmetics that give you an advantage.\n\nStay away from this game. This game doesn't have fun as one of its intentions, it prefers money.\n\nThis game is published by Zepetto U.S.A, which is interesting as Zepetto were the guys who actually developed this game.","May 10","false","2.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

This game is most certainly not pay 2 win anymore. Yes it takes a little while of grinding to unlock the good guns but what game doesn't? If you know what gun to buy at lower level then you can get by untill you unlock the good guns. You cant expect to play this game and have all the perks the higher level players have and expect to be as good instantly. They put there time in to level up, has nothing to do with cash.\n\nThis is typical NA e-sports. I play cs as well and i'm pretty good. If someone is better then you to cry ♥♥♥♥♥ and moan. In this game all you need is a good gun, and there is many guns to choose from that are viable competitively..\n\nThis game is fast paced, people comparing it to CSGO are probably ♥♥♥♥♥♥ FPS players. This game has also been out for 5 years. Csgo wasn't out in 2010. The international tournament uses a competitive rule set and many of the players and teams on this game can play with a competitive rule set and often encourage it, discouraging\npay 2 win. This game has massive user bases in every country except North America.The reason for this is the past publishers of the game were terrible.\n\nThe new publishers of this game are the owners of the company that produced the game and they are the first good publisher this game has had since it's release and they took over a year ago..\nThe new game has a much more balanced system and a better credit system that makes it nearly impossible to run out of in game currency.

Unlike CS where you're thrown in with players who have played for years and stomp a mudhole in you as soon as you spawn.. The maps in this game are pretty great, the weapons are vast, Plus you can be a dinosaur if you choose.. A DINOSAUR!!! All in all a very fun play.","November 24, 2015","true","30.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can eitherbuy the guns (p2w) or you can just play the game and get some good weopons. The grind is there though which makes you wanna buy the guns but once you get a good gun, you'll probably be going 69 to 4. Yes, I was part of the tryhards. The grenade spam ruins the game (at least for me), which is why I haven't played it that much on this account. I do recommend this game.

Not quite sure why this game has mostly negative reviews.. It's quite fun in many ways. Great weapons, Great community. I have never been a fan of the Counter Strike series.. But this is fun. I especially like the fact that you can ADS, and it's a game you can get good at quickly.. Unlike CS where you're thrown in with players who have played for years and stomp a mudhole in you as soon as you spawn.. The maps in this game are pretty great, the weapons are vast, Plus you can be a dinosaur if you choose.. A DINOSAUR!!! All in all a very fun play.","November 24, 2015","true","30.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In all seriousness this game is decent, coming from CS 1.6, CS:S and now CS:GO, i was doing well, i wanted to give this game a chance by reinstalling it and trying it, but it wont work. So i just decided in writing a negavtive review, this game has a  very big future if they fix the crashes and all the bugs and stuff, in all my 30 minute I found no  bugs, but I saw other peoples reviews and they were saying that the game is ♥♥♥♥ and it relates to cs but its a "♥♥♥♥♥♥ cs" tbh, thsi game has a good future but they really need to remove the AUG, Yes it is  a gun and is popular in use, but i get pwned by it from long distances while im running in my spawn with my assoult rifle and they just ♥♥♥♥ing spray me down from range like its Call of Duty. This game is good with a good future, but has alot of downsides that just makes the game kinda ♥♥♥♥. If the makers improve this, fix the crashes and maybe make the menu a bit less confusing, maybe i will comeback with a positive review and have a few hours in the game. But at the moment the game has a future if the makers even bother with making it a bit better, I hope the makers make a sequeal maybe or just have a huge update fixing everything reviewers like me are having problems with, my overall rating out of ten is 3/10, it could be better though, This game heavely dissapointed me... I thought i was gonnna have a blast with my friends.. but seems like csgo is the right choice for me instead of this. Sad ending? haha no. Just forget that "but seems" ending because thats quite sad and be happy.","November 26, 2015","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Whenever buying a gun using real money, we can only use that item for one day, that is a COMPLETE waste of money, in the beginning starter players are given powerful guns to waste. The video preveiwing this game is imensely misleading, a suggestion is adding a campaign and storyline, would have made this game better - consider all these things and play the game yourself, you will see the problems.","January 22","false","28.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

This game, many years ago... (5+/6+ years possibly [highly speculative]) was called Point Blank. Then, after what I assume only to be a commercial failure, Zepetto games re-released it with the name Project Blackout (3+/4+ years ago [also speculative]). Now it has been re-re-released under the name Piercing Blow. Same game, different name. SSDD. Basically, the point of this game is to waste your money on temporary guns, wreck people with them, then lose them after their time period/use period is over. HOWEVER, if you're the kind of person who DOESN'T spend money on these kinds of games, then your gameplay experience is summed up with this: getting romped on by people who paid for weapons and skins. This game is the very definition of pay to win. I only installed it on here just so I could write this review, as to hopefully warn any of you from wasting disk space on it. I WARN YOU, WHATEVER EXCITING THING YOU THOUGHT THIS GAME WAS, IT ISN'T. If you're looking for a similarly styled, but much more well-made f2p fps WITH permanent NON-PAID-FOR/MICROTRANSACTION weapons, try something like Alliance of Valiant Arms.","April 13","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RealorFake/recommended/382850/","RealorFake","Phazez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RealorFake/","158 products in account","Honestly was looking forward to playing this game. That said, after playing this game for a few rounds I have come to terms that the "anti-cheat" software really isnt there. It's a pay to win game, the more money you put into the game for better guns, the more accurate and more powerful the guns are. The in-game points currency isnt really there for use, its there to have something other then cash purchases. The guns you can buy with in-game currency are really useless, I purchased the AK thinking that it would be powerful but inaccurate, like most ak's are in every other game, but in this case the AK is terrible. It has no power and no accuracy what so ever. As a free to play FPS, this is pretty far down on the list. Its to Pay to Win and could be over looked if the basic weapons, such as, the AK and M4 were a bit more powerful to give the true free to play players a chance. Over all I would give this game a 4/10\n\n","April 28","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
