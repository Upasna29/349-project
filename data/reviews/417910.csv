The biggest problem is they will be region locking everybody so now it will REALLY be a dead game for anyone outside Europe. Its a shame I spent 30 hours on this game in the last 3 days, spent 20 dollers on 2 accounts and premium status to try and support it, along with combatting the negative misleading reviews on Steam. But i've come to realise after all that.... AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS IF YOU ARE NOT FROM EUROPE. You will just pour money into a game that hasnt even been thought out yet.\n\nJust about every system in the game is broken or hasnt even been thought out properly yet. The combat is beyond exploitable, players just spam 1 single attack over and over again to keep you in a constant stun. Its like, didnt you think about that when you built the combat system you dumb ♥♥♥♥♥? I understand this is early access but it feels like these developers are using alphabet blocks for the first time as babies...\n\nAnd if you had any brains, you would just avoid this game all together. Its one of those cash grabs that will never come out of early access. Its lead by two developers who seem like theyve never seen how an MMO works.\n\nSo yeah, now i've certainly built a grudge and will be doing everything in my power to destroy its reputation on steam. Stay away from this peasent filled game developed by some eggheads in a war torn country.","January 26","false","33.9"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","0"

Then I tried to join conquest (that was pretty fast) and the tip kindly informed me that drinks are refilled after respawn (P2W yeah). Ok, I thought, let's see what's the game like now. Well, awful is not enough to describe it. Graph has improved from what I remember, but every other aspect is unchanged or even worse.\nThere were only 2 other players on the map. You could rolldodge like some freaking sonic before and now you have to mash the button to make the idiot do that. There's STILL no way to lock on the enemy. The controls became less responsive than before. As it's still EA I have a little hope it will improve, but only little.","January 25","false","2.9"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","10","18","0","0"

There is no bigger shame for oposite team fans than to lose a flag :)\nI would also like to suggest blood & gore, and that you can actualy customize clothes (amblems,colors...)\nRest of things im interested in are already stated in game description that will come with future updates.\n\nThere are two type of currency in-game Respect Points(RP) and Gold, RP are earned by simply playing game, while gold is only buyable with real money?! But wait a minute, this isnt Pay2Win game, you can also with RP buy same stuff as with gold, only you would need a bit more grinding. I also heard that ¨maybe¨ there should be exchange option added, to switch RP to Gold, like in Wargaming games, we will yet see if it will happen with times to come.\nThe best thing there is that if someone do play with premium acc, with energy drinks, that may give him stronger hit, HP rege, and you just started playing game, you can still kick his a**. overskill him, or just throw brick to his head xD\n\nGraphic for current state is very decent and satisfactory.\nSound OK for now, but I would love to see emotes, yell,rage...etc\n\n\nOverall;\nIf you are in fighting games, this is a MUST BUY! Hooligan Fighters offer so much for acceptable money.\n\nGraphic:         8/10\nSound  :      7,5/10\nGameplay:  8,5/10","January 22","true","17.2"," 19 of 37 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","19","37","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fantis6/recommended/417910/","fantis6","fantis6","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fantis6/","2600 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHooligan Fighters is MMO fighting game what based at close combat fight.\nThis game game just some days ago come to steam and now in Early Access. At the moment game have two game modes. For playing you should crate own character. After this you can start a fight. In a fights you can use punches and kicks also you can grab a thing from the land for example stone. After all battle you got XP and cash to. When you level up you can you unlock new fighting skills and clothes to buy. For buy this you can use the money what you earned in battles or premium. Also you can buy boosters or ability changer cards. The controls are enough simple,  you can learn it fast. Sounds are okey, graphic in some moments looks good, but a character not very detailed. The game at the moment have some bugs and the fight are also not looks to smooth even though you turn a graphic to minimal.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+some fresh air in this genre\n+many combo possibility in fight\n+can play up to 10 vs 10\n\n-a characters not to detailed\n-some bugs\n-the fight not to smooth\n\nSo, im mentioned at the start, the game now in early access because this at the moment can be some problems in game, but the developers work with it, so i hope especially the fights been fixed in closest time. This game have a good potential, so i think when its get full release its come to really enjoyable game.","January 22","true","4.1"," 18 of 38 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","18","38","0","0"
