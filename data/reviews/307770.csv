This game add's a new chapter to the survival horror experience that puts Resident evil and Silent hill to shame.\n\nIt has graphic scenes such as giving you the option of ripping out the reproductive organs of any horse you click on and also allows you to watch as the various horses sodomize eachother.\n\nReview update 2016: What makes Horses happy? Apperently not 4'x8' living conditions.","August 7, 2014","true","2.3"," 123 of 183 people (67%) found this review helpful 82 people found this review funny","67","123","183","82","2"

Most have coat color choices as well. Wish they had made this expansion for Wildlife Park 3 as well. I definitely enjoy being able to have horses in a game without the tweeny gameplay of having to brush and "doll up" your horse. Just note that as a part of the Wildlife Park series, there is "realistic" breeding, so a word of caution to people who may be buying this for younger children.","October 19, 2014","true","22.6"," 24 of 24 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","24","24","0","0"

Especially those who're fed up about cathing butterflies...\n\n+ Most facts and scenarios are well researched.\n+ Easy to learn and understand\n+ Good variation among the missions\n+++ Unlike most other horse games, this one isn't cutified. There are no missions about petting cute bunnies , catching butterflies etc. The focus is more reality oiented than that.\n\n- The zoom is limited. One needs to be able to zoom out more while building.\n- The herd composition doesn't matter, which is quite unrealistic. In real life stallions don't get along with each other if there are mares in the same herd.\n- The missions are quite few and simple","June 23, 2015","true","0.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"
