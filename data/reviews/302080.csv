Bus Driver puts you in the driver's seat of several different buses on several different routes that you have to chose from. While it would be easy to dismiss a game like this, I will give it credit for having a subtle, deep and nuanced driving system.\n\nIts a game that takes patience that I'm surprised I had when I am so used to playing fast pace arcade style racers. Each route can take around ten minutes, but later routes require more time. Its a real time investment and commitment that some people can muster, but there is always a challenge.\n\nThe driving is complex, slamming on the brakes might stop you faster, but it'll adjudicate your passengers into anger. Driving through a red light will get points deducted.Even changing lanes without using your turning signal is another infraction. Of course for every punishment there can be a reward. The game will give you points for successful stops at red lights and even lane changes. Cars behind you at red lights will honk for you to go, but your job as a bus driver is just tune it out.\n\nHappy passengers will give you score bonuses. If you drive a full mile with no penalties or if your passengers stay happy, you earn a score. There is always incentive to keep everything running smooth in an environment that without patience can go catastrophic.\n\nBecause you're driving long buses, the mundane becomes the challenge and the focus. Turning a corner can turn into an accident; too wide and you'll run into the wrong lane if not slam into oncoming traffic. There is no damage for any accident, just a point deduction. If you turn too sharp, you could take out a lamp post, street light or hit a wall.\n\nYour goal is so simple, yet challenging; stop at designated points, pick up passengers and drop them off; that's it. Oh it sounds simple, but its still difficult. Stopping without slamming on your brakes, having to rush to your next stop without infractions and of course waiting for people to get on or off your bus. You never see them enter or leave, they just disappear from the bus stop.\n\nFor what it lacks in human animations, it makes up for details in the city you drive in. There are firetrucks, ambulances, cars and other buses, but there are nice touches everywhere. Broken down semi trailers require you to shift lanes. You'll find construction here and there and parked cars can litter a road. I never expected the game to go that far to make the world feel real.\n\nAnother interesting diversity of the game are the highways and off ramps. Its more than just flat surfaces, you'll have to deal with the bus and all of its weight and momentum going up or down inclines. When you drive fast enough, the bus begins to rock. I'm not sure if that's the wind rocking you. It all blends together to make a more believable experience that you need to control these bus beasts.\n\nWhile this is a believable, almost simulation like experience, the points system makes it still feel like a game. At the end of each route, you're score is tallies for passengers, delivery time, bonuses and penalties. The score then gets saved and the top six high scores stay with that route. Its good encouragement to keep trying to do better and better.\n\nThe game is broken up into six tiers, each of which has six or so routes with different buses. Each of the buses might look different, but they all feel the same. Perhaps there is some subtle nuance between them, but I never felt it. Once you finish a few routes, the next tier is unlocked.\n\nYour routes take place in the same fictional city, but this city has a diverse array of places like downtown streets, snowy mountain roads, an airport roundabout and serine vistas overlooking ponds. While the graphics could be better, they are acceptable and around the good level. There are far worse games graphically, but if you expect to be dazzled, you'll be disappointed.\n\nTo guide you from stop to stop is your GPS that gives you a red dot and you just follow the path. Even better than that is the roads themselves will have flashing arrows indicating your next turn or if you go forward through a five corner crossroad.\n\nOn top of the city is the environment that changes from route to route. Downpours, night and fog are all here; as is bright and happy days. The rain never felt like it had an effect on the brakes like coming down a hill does.\n\nThere are only two types of cameras, one that follows behind the bus, which can make it difficult to see any cars directly in front of you. The camera seems to be slightly to the side of the bus, which feels off, but it does allow you to see a bit down your nose. The other camera puts you into the grill of your bus. I would say its first person, but in this case, you see what your headlights do. You won't find any behind the wheel angles here, in fact it makes me feel like I'm less of a bus driver and more of the bus itself.\n\nFor a game called Bus Driver, I expected more of a career and the ability to select a driver to be my character. Instead the routes have text blurbs explaining them, but they're almost always the same. Later tiers offer a few deviations, such as follow a helicopter, ignore the laws and get prisoners to a new penitentiary without injury. Its this sort of ingenuity that surprised me.\n\nIn terms of sound and music, Bus Driver is bare bones. The only music is in the menus and while playing the game itself, you'll hear the hypnotic hum of the engine and other realistic sounds such as air brakes and horns.\n\nIts a game that is still engaging and enjoyable on some level, so why do I say stay away from it? Bus Driver is a very niche game. There are better games out there, but if you prefer driving games to racing games, this may be up your alley. Its a cheap game, but if it goes on sale, take a risk. Just expect the worst and you might end up having a delightful experience, or laughing that you can anger your passengers from braking too hard.","September 1, 2015","true","2.2"," 68 of 74 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","68","74","4","0"

Not the Steam version.\n\nA classic from SCS.\n\nThe game is basically broken up into bite-sized missions where you take a specific bus type on a single route, picking up and dropping off passengers in a variety of locations and weather conditions. Early missions are usually under five minutes, steadily increasing over more advanced tiers. You're scored in real time along the way for obeying common traffic rules and docked points for upsetting your passengers (breaking too hard, running lights, etc.) along the way. At the end of your route your score is tallied and put in a high-score table.\n\nPresentation-wise, the graphics are dated (technically), but since it's a '07 title it takes next to nothing to crank all the settings up to 11, giving the game a clean, inviting look. It comes off as super charming, with a vivid and colorful pallet.  The constantly-updating UI overlays just scream classic SEGA sit-down arcade racer fun.  Overall, the game has a very unique look that gives it a lot of personality.  And because it's going for a more cartoonish look, I think it's aged FAR better visually than older SCS truck-sim titles of the same period.\n\nFinally, the game can be very challenging as you get further into the missions.  Obeying traffic laws while keeping your passengers happy and on time takes strict focus, which tests your meddle over longer 10 & 15+ minute routes.\n\nI think Bus Driver is a hidden gem from SCS that could be too easily overlooked based on the screenshots.  The game is a ton of fun, more arcade in nature than the simulation that SCS is known for.  Great for short-burst gaming or prolonged sessions.  It's got a nice price tag too.\n\nSCS has a free demo for it on thier website.\n\nhttp://www.scssoft.com/download_bus_driver_demo.php\n\nPlay it with a 360 pad if you can.\n\nIf you enjoyed ETS2 and are curious to try some SCS history, you can't go wrong with Bus Driver.","June 4, 2014","true","2.1"," 50 of 53 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","50","53","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/302080/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Bus Driver offers 12 unique and detailed buses to drive around cities, suburbs, and the outlying countryside. Your goal is simple; drive from stop to stop, pick up and drop off passengers, and try to stay on time while obeying traffic laws and not wrecking the bus. Easy huh? Not quite.\n\nThere are 30 routes divided into 5 tiers of increasing difficulty where the timetables are shorter, the routes are longer, and traffic and weather conditions get even more challenging. Depending on the bus you are driving and the particular mission, your duties might vary slightly. One mission might have you taking kids to school while the next might have you transporting tourists on a sightseeing tour or visiting businessmen to a convention center from the airport. And things get really exciting when you get to drive the prison bus and transport prisoners from the jail to the courthouse complete with police roadblocks, chopper escort, and a free pass on obeying traffic laws.\n\nI won't lie, Bus Driver can be a bit boring and repetitive, but I'm guessing real-life bus drivers didn't pick their vocation for the thrills. The buses are painfully slow and aside from the few missions where you actually get to go out on the highway you are seldom going to achieve speeds greater than 30-40mph. But that is probably a good thing since just about the time you do get "moving" you find yourself quickly approaching a bus stop or a red light or some crazy driver pulls into your lane and cuts you off.\n\nThe rules for each mission are simple. You have a list of stops and an interval time assigned to each. You need to get to each stop on time, then stay until the designated departure time. This part really threw me, because I always wanted to leave once everybody had boarded so I had extra time to get to the next stop, but you really can't leave early or you might miss a straggler. Remember "no child left behind" applies to school buses too.\n\nNo matter how hard you try it's impossible to stay on time. Between traffic and stop lights my best percentage for staying on time was 47%. There is no real penalty, just a lack of bonus points when your final score is tabulated at the end of your route. You will get penalized for breaking traffic laws, driving recklessly, and of course, crashing the bus. There is even a meter to judge how hard you are applying the brakes. If you brake too hard and cause discomfort to your passengers, points will be deducted.\n\nThe game tracks a lot of information like the current happiness of your passengers, how many are sitting, standing, getting off at the next stop, etc. When you pull into a bus stop and open the door the loading and unloading counters tick off the people that board and disembark the bus and a timer counts how long each stop takes. One clever element I found while driving the prison bus; the passengers start off with red angry icons and get happier with each sudden stop and wreck.\n\nBeing a simulation it is imperative to obey all traffic laws, even ones that we, as everyday drivers, might have become a bit lax in. You must signal when pulling away from the curb and changing lanes. You must stop for red lights and not drive too far into the intersection. You even have the four-way flashers for the school bus. The only bus-specific law I didn't see implemented was stopping and opening the door at railroad crossings.\n\nBus Driver has a massive city with multiple areas of diversity, so each missions looks and plays out differently. Sure, there is a bit of overlap in the scenery by the time you reach the third or forth tier, but the routes are always different as are the stops. There is even a day and night cycle and rain and snowy weather, which also affect the handling of your bus. Nothing is scarier than starting to fishtail a shuttle bus in the snow as you speed away from the airport.\n\nOf course a driving game is only as good as the controls and physics. Bus Driver nails the physics of these massive vehicles with special attention to momentum and a larger turn radius that makes right turns challenging. The game defaults to keyboard control and it gets the job done while being a bit awkward at times. It's really hard to make a smooth arcing turn with a keyboard. I played the first tier with the keyboard then broke out my gamepad for the rest of the game, but even that presented some interesting challenges, especially with the gas and brake, which were overly sensitive. I really had to learn how to feather the brakes to keep my passengers from screaming in terror.\n\nI had my doubts about how good a game called Bus Driver would actually look, or even how well I needed to look. It�s a fairly utilitarian game design that doesn't lend itself to flashing visuals or special effects, but that didn't stop the designers from really making the most out of the opportunity to create a massive living city. Each area of the game world is quite distinct but blends naturally into each adjoining section so you won't even notice when you go from the narrow streets of the city to the curvy mountain roads or the passenger pick-up lane at the airport. It just looks and feels real.\n\nThere are nice subtle effects, especially for the weather. Leaves will float off trees, headlights will illuminate the road ahead, and there are nice lens flare effects off all the lighting. The city architecture is diverse enough but the textures and signage definitely gets repetitive. The framerate is really smooth and there is support for all screen resolutions, even widescreen modes.\n\nThe traffic models are excellent with a nice assortment of cars, trucks, and other buses. Naturally, the bus models received the most attention and the look fantastic, complete with realistic physics that cause them to tip slightly during sharp turns. Working brake lights, turns signals and flashers complete the design. There are no pedestrians on the streets and the design for the passengers is limited to static images of people at the bus stop who magically vanish and appear inside your bus.\n\nThe one thing I really wanted was some selection for camera views. The "behind the bus" angle works when you are going straight, but making turns, especially sharp turns, often became blind turns as the camera takes way too long to swing back in behind the bus. It also gets dangerous when following other cars. Despite the bus turning transparent, it is too easy to rear-end another car, especially in the confines of a tunnel.\n\nThere is a very pleasant jazz theme for the opening title sequence and menus. It's part piano, part drums, and part guitar, and totally enjoyable. Once you get into the game you'll be left with the sounds of traffic, the click of turn signals, the ding sound when you open and close your bus door, the purr of the engine and the hiss of the air brakes. You can even honk your horn but nobody seems to get out of the way when you do, even when you are carrying a busload of prisoner which a chopper flying above you.\n\nOf course the best sound effect is the one you don't want to hear - your passengers screaming out in terror when you lock up your brakes, hit a car or glance off a guardrail. I was also amused at the cheers from the prisoners who enjoyed my reckless driving and the cheers, whistles, and applause at the end of each mission always strokes my ego, even if I didn't get a high score.\n\nBus Driver is a surprisingly engaging driving simulation that might just give you some insight into the daily lives of real bus drivers around the world. It's great fun in a non-traditional game setting where you actually feel good about obeying traffic laws and driving safe, rather than running from the police and driving like a madman.","March 5","true","26.3"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","27","29","2","1"

This game is very good to pass the time, and has decent graphics. However, it is not so much of a simluator as a game and there is no free-roam capability (but you can still drive anywhere while playing a mission). This is simular to Euro Truck Simulator 2 in the way that it is very picky; you get points docked for not turning on your blinkers while switching lanes, and the controls can sometimes be a challenge around corners. I recommend you should go through the controls before playing your first mission, because they don't tell you on their own. Another thing: You can't manipulate the camera. Most of the time, the camera is fine, but when driving in the neighboorhoods where there are a lot of trees, they get in the way of your view. The camera sometimes tries to move to help but usually doesn't make things better. The traffic lights also seem to be rigged; they don't stay green if you're approaching them. This annoys me a lot when I'm driving in the city, where there are 5-lane roads that are completely empty, and I am speeding down one towards a green light, which suddenly turns yellow (for what seems like a fraction of a second) and then red. 200 points lost for a traffic light offense. The AI of the other cars on the road isn't the greatest it could have been, too, and they don't seem to do anything when you honk at them.

And I'm not going to lie, I expected it to be a pretty terrible game. I mean it came along with like six other no-name games for less than $3; how good could it be? I don't know why I even bought that bundle now that I think about it, I was probably drunk or something. However, after playing 'Bus Driver' for a few hours I can safely admit that this is one of the best simulation games that I have ever played. And even though it is truly a simulation game it also feels like an arcade game at the same time. But that probably has something to do with the look and the feel of the game. Just think 'Crazy Taxi' with a bus and some rules.\n\nNow I know that rules don't sound like the most fun thing ever, but the best part of this game is, you guessed it, following the rules. Don't forget to use your turn signal, don't rattle the passengers too much or they'll leave, don't brake too often, don't brake too little, etc. You can see where I'm going with this. Another great aspect of this game is how true-to-bus the steering is, making it a pretty difficult game at times. So if you've ever wondered what the life of a bus driver was like, grab this game while you can.

Meanwhile I'm still trying to go straight and the bus is stuck to me like f**king gum.  I finally get to a stop and have to back up still stuck to the other bus, while still getting penalized for points for being in a collision.  I fnally got un-stuck and drove off while my customers are p*ssed and my points went out the window.\n\nIs this a game to fufill your desire to drive a bus?  Yes.  Is it a game that you can love AND hate?  YES.  It's a lot of fun, but it's old and has a lot of stupid things that can get annoying.\n\nYou're always pressured to be the quickest way possible and with the crappy mechanics, it makes it harder.  I've been on time, and found out you have to wait until you reach the time before you can go, which is realistic, but then I end up being late for the last one for no reason.  The timing doesn't make sense.  ALSO, they perfectly timed the lights, traffic and everything else to make sure if you are the fastest, you will make all green lights... but if you are a few seconds behind, you end up being screwed and have to wait at a red light being honked at.\n\nIn some missions, you literally have a free ride, you just drive straight and there's like 20 cars in the left lane, but the right lane is free so you can get the fastest time possibile.  So that takes you out of the immersion not having cars in front of you stopped at the lights and stuff.\n\nAlso the AI stops INSTANTLY and goes to full speed from a stop INSTANTLY.\n\nThe braking?  If you're using a keyboard you have to keep tapping brake and if you go a big too far... BAM -100 points and all your customers scream like you put your pants down to show your big hairy shlong.\n\nPROS:\n\nOkay graphics for its time\nFun at times\nFun to play in different conditions\nMany different buses and missions\n\nCONS:\n\nDrivers honk at you for stopping at red light\nALWAYS pressured to be on time\nBraking is annoying\nCrappy AI\nWeird turning that really screws you up\nBad points system - 200 points for going through a red... 50 points for hitting something\nNo free roam (Or I couldn't find it)\nNo cockpit view, only bumper view and third-person\n\nOverall this game is fun, but buy when it's on sale.  There's a lot of bugs and it's annoying.  I still beat all the different missions.","December 4, 2015","true","8.2"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","11","11","5","0"

The city (and suburbs) we're driving in for the missions is large and detailed. There are weather effects like snow, rain, storms, and I personally found that snow-covered roads do affect the driving slightly.\n\nThe game runs flawlessly on my Win7 64-bit system with an AMD Radeon card.

That being said I'm not someone who would shy away from a "free" game so after playing hours and hours of ETS2 I got bored of my truck and decided to give Bus Driver a shot.\n\nBoy was I disappointed, your start out at "tier 1" in which are maybe about 5/10 ten bus jobs I'm not really sure. I went with the very first one your typical yellow American schoolbus. The first thing I noticed (besides the outdated graphics which where to be expected) was that there wasn't an actual "inside view" in this game you have two views either the classic "look from above view" or the "all the way upfront" view in which you are low to the road and only see the road.\n\nBeing a little disappointed and probably a bit spoiled by ETS2 I decided to start driving and it actually went pretty well until I got to the first corner. It steers extremely heavy which might or might not make the game realistic I wouldn't know but it makes driving it a huge pain in the ♥♥♥ and not something you'd do for very long.\n\nSo here I came to my first stop I nicely parked it in the designated spot and waited. It probably took me about 10 seconds to figure out that the green text on the top of the game had stopped giving it's normal traffic plus or minus points depending whether or not you stick to the rules and it had been replaced with "press enter to open the door".\n\nNow this probably supposed to be the fun part of the game when you have picked up your passengers they will be happy or unhappy depending on whether you stick to the traffic rules, drop them off on time, don't brake too hard and several other factors.\n\nI myself got bored of this very quickly because there is very little traffic on the road which made it way to easy. Nonetheless I found myself to the end with quite an acceptable score and wondered how much I'd get paid. Well you don't you see your score on the highscore list and you select the next level. Kind of like your old fashioned arcade game with the joystick and the 3 buttons.\n\nI ended up playing 2 more levels to see if there was any difference whatsoever in the busses and I must admit they drove a little better then the first bus but not enough to be a game changer.\n\nMy advise if you are a fan of the old fashioned arcade games or simply haven't gamed a lot you might enjoy this game. If you've had a taste of what the games today are capable of do not buy this game you will be sorely disappointed.","November 7, 2014","false","0.3"," 25 of 44 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","25","44","0","0"

I bought this in the sale for £1.39 and it was definitely worth the price. I like the funky music on the options screens as well.\n\nIt took me a while to realise you are not supposed to go through red lights and that you have to indicate when you leave a bus stop, but then I am no driver and have also played far too much Grand Theft Auto.

A pity there isn't more content, though. I suppose it is kind of a simulator, but the gameplay is quite simplified. This makes it easy to just pick up the game whenever you feel like completing a mission or two and then forget about it for a week. A proper controller is recommended, since most of the driving requires quite a bit of accuracy and finesse.

Not saying it looks terrible but does look old. However the resolution does support 1680*1050 so thats a plus. So it looks  good on a modern system as in you dont see any black bars on the side. The game is very arcade like. The bus does feel heavy and does take some time to stop and you get penalized for not using blinkers and braking to hard and so forth. You get bonus points for not running red lights and using your blinkers.\n\nThe people act like cardboard cutouts. They do not move they just disappear into the bus and out of the bus. The city is big and somewhat ok looking. The fast food places where you drop people off have animated signs and their is weather effects in the game like snow. The camera view is not great. You have 2 views  one in the very front and the chase one. The chase camera is a little on the lazy side and doesnt always give you a good view. I went with the front of the bus view for better control of the bus.\n\nThe music is terrible and not good. Sound effects are good. My Xbox360 gamepad I did finally get it to work however  I could not get the braking right so  I used Joy to key. Its free and works well. You can look this up online to download and use. They do have different buses you can drive so thats a plus. Overall I would recommend this if you can get it on sale. The original asking price of $10 dollars is a lot on the steep side. I bought it online for $4 dollars with 7 other games. The sale is still going on for another 12 days. Bundle Stars online. Also the other nice plus is the missions dont last all that long. Its very arcade like game.\n\nSo I finished the game. Took 7 hours. I had fun playing it. Some of the faults of the game that stand out lane changes penalties sometimes are random. Bus can go out of control very quickly. A very much arcade like experience.","November 20, 2014","true","7.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

I have only played this game 2.3 hours but it seemed ALOOOOT longer than that. I only bothered to complete 2 of the 6 ingame tiers. On Steam, I put the game in my completed category because the games tiers are exactly the same, only with longer distances and different busses.\n\nEverything in this game looks terrible. It has a nice cell shaded vibe, but being a simulator released in 2007, it is plain awful. The controls are clunky (a bus probably does drive clunky though), the music is okay, and it just feels like work to play this game. I’m sure you’re thinking something like this, “But it is a game that simulates a real job!” Good point, but it is a game. Euro Truck Simulator 2 managed to make it fun and it’s even made by the same developers.\n\nThe only thing I can give this game is okay music and initial pleasure when I played it for the first time, but that died quickly. If this review doesn’t make you not want to buy this game, then buy it on a very steep sale or in a bundle like I did.\n\nI rate this game a 2/10\n\nFor more reviews, check out my game reviews here: www.gonemadgaming.com\n\n~rhillfake\n\n3DS Friend Code: 2595-3048-4554 || Steam\Origin\Other: rhillfake || Xbox Live: WasBottlehead99","December 29, 2015","false","2.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The game isn't nearly as good as either.  The controls are horrible, the sound is dull and uninspiring, and the point system in this game makes very little sense.\n\nThe passenger models are super creepy.  Actually, this game's graphics in general are creepy.  It has that weird stage of 3D models and environments where some of it looks 2D and some of it looks 3D.\n\nStill, something about it is fun.  The missions are pretty quick and easy and I found amusement seeing how fast I could get the bus going without swerving and crashing on turns.  I'm just glad that SCS Software made this game and decided that they could improve on it to create the VASTLY superior Euro Truck Simulator 2.    3/10.

I enjoyed Euro Truck Simulator 2 so I thought this wouldn't be so bad. I was wrong. For starters, this game lagged like no tomorrow and I had the graphic settings down too low. I quit after completeing tier one and I'm glad I did. This game took away score for every little thing. One round I ended up with a score of 13. The gameplay is driving around a bus with a fixed camera, which gets annoying after the free roaming camera in Euro Truck. This game also makes you park your bus in a small space to drop off your passengers rather than the automatic parking in Euro Truck. If you want a driving sim, just go for Euro Truck Simulator 2.

First of all the camera angle of this game is AWFUL!! when you turn a bus, the camera angle doesn't follow the bus, so you could see the side of the bus when you're turning. Also, the traffic light is a troll. the traffic light literally turn red as you're  about 150m away to enter the crossing. and there no way you can use the brake to stop in time. speaking of which, Why does this game limit you're using the brake, in other SCS game, non of them have brake meter, which limit you how hard you can brake, and it's also stupid because with the brake meter that only allow you to brake at a certain point, it takes forever to stop the bus. and it feel like some of the bus braking is so unrealistic. The speed of the bus is also unrealistic. First of all how could a city bus can drive 40MPH on a street road, while when the tour bus go on the highway it can only go as fast as 55MPH, which most tour bus can go 60 or even 70 MPH on city Highway. The map is pretty big, but I don't get why one part of the map is like summer weather like and the other part where the airport is fill with snow? The bus are pretty cool, the weather is somewhat realistic. The AI is better than euro truck simulator 2. but the graphic look pretty outdated. so if you want to buy a REAL Bus simulator game try OSMI, or bus simulator 2012, that has better graphic and more realism than this game","June 29, 2014","false","4.7"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","7","20","0","0"

Driving a buss instead of a truck like in the other SCS games, can be a bit less freedom inspiring. This game is not about driving from town to town delivering stuff, it is about driving in A town, delivering people. You get points for proper blinker usage, not breaking to hard, stopping for red lights, transporting people and... thats it i think. An immediate free roam mode (pick a line and drive it) would have been good, instead of forcing the player to take tutorials. Can i recommend it?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the1observant/recommended/302080/","the1observant","the1observant","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the1observant/","40 products in account","It's using older modeling graphics, but it's still cute enough to play around with. I can tell that Bus Driver was just a practice run to test ideas with, and anybody who has also played ETS2 would know what I'm talking about (but that's another story for some other day) - :)\n\nI'm not a wheel controller person, I'm strictly a keyboarder who knows how to simulate a wheel on arrow keys. But the technique requires good clean coding in the game for it to work properly. Fortunately, Bus Driver does have good keyboard response times and works well with a USB keyboard.\n\nThe game is broken up into 6 scenarios across 6 different Tiers = 36 missions. Obviously Tier 6 has the tricky missions, more stops, more turns, more intersections and traffic lights, and rush traffic that deliberately gets in your way, but I still find them just as easy as the previous Tiers as long as you watch your speed.\n\nMy favorite missions are 3-5, 4-5, and 6-5 ... these are all prison bus missions where you must transport prisoners to a specific location. Now, usually you have to keep passengers Happy, but in these missions you have to keep the prisoners Unhappy while trying to keep up with a helicopter flying overhead. However, it's actually more fun to become a rogue bus driver and give the prisoners some joy by deliberately doing demolition style driving and ramming cop cars. It's hillarious entertainment for sure.\n\nBus Driver is okay with the low-end expectations of a simulator, so I'm not going to go there. But, what I will do is list some things the game is missing...\n1. There is NO cockpit view, in fact what little you can see inside the buses is limited to side shots while stopping at bus stops and turning sharply in chase view mode.\n2. The passengers are totally static. They do not move. They are not animated in any way. They just stand still, suddenly disappear during pickup, and different ones sort of teleport to the inside of the bus. I'm sorry, but this was a really lame d__khead move for the developers to stoop that cheap, and I KNOW they could have done better.\n3. Bus engine SFX are not authentic. They are low grade and totally manufactured out of thin air.\n4. Apparently the handicapped is SOL in this game, because there's not a chair lift in sight anywhere!\n5. There are no bus trains. Not all that surprising considering the pedestrian population appears to be unrealistically tiny and wouldn't need the trains anyway.\n6. There is no bus damage or malfunctions available. You just lose points for colliding into things.\n7. Dual position traffic lights do not exist in this game. There's only one set of traffic lights way the h_ll over on the opposite side of the intersection and that's it. They are very wide intersections which make those traffic lights look like peanut shells with faint LED's on them. It's better to drive at night than day in this game.\n8. A.I. vehicle physics are virtually non-existent in this game. Example... A.I. vehicles instantly take off at max speed when a traffic light turns green, including the other A.I. buses! They also brake instantly while you're struggling to come to a stop without brake spiking. Not fair, Not fair!\n9. None of the buses have a properly configured transmission, so don't expect any of them to behave correctly especially while climbing hills, or when jab stopping to change direction.\n\n... I'm stopping right there. That's enough for the wall of shame, I think.\n\nChanged my mind. I think I will note some of the best features of Bus Driver...\n1. Love the weather system, which includes rain, thunder, snow and slippery roads. In fact, you're not having fun unless you're driving a bus sideways down the highway. You can also sort of drift the turns, but wheel spin is not being calculated to support it fully. It's an "almost" feature - LOL. (hey, I can't help it, I'm a natural lead footer!)\n2. Buses will do at least an automatic dual kneel, but since the passengers never actually walk up to the bus, this feature is mostly cosmetic.\n3. Bus doors actually move open/close, but again... purely cosmetic since the passengers are expert teleporters.\n4. When I mess up, the passenger screams and yells make me laugh every time.\n5. You are penalized for not using turn signals properly. This is a challenge by itself especially when you come across other vehicles that are parked in the bus lane, and you're trying to race the clock for a better score.\n6. In addition to being able to roam freely anywhere a road is... If you can maintain a steady speed, then you can also roam freely "off-road style", provided you don't drive off the flat Earth, or hit a barrier or ditch and get stuck. (speed is the trick). Some things you can drive completely through, others you can't.\n7. For the fun of it... you can drive in reverse the wrong way and not get penalized, but you need at least 1 mirror to watch for traffic and you still have to use turn signals. Has absolutely nothing to do with the missions, but it's still fun to do. (how many of you will actually go try this, just to see if I'm lying?)\n8. This should be # 1, but ... The game has NEVER crashed with me! (knock on wood).\n\nWell, that wraps up my fun review today. I've got some bus passengers to terrorize. Cheerio!","February 22, 2015","false","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Probably because I was in a not so serious mood. Reading the reviews at that time I still could not believe it was a serious game. I was under the impression it would just be a game where you could screw over passengers and what not. Hours later I was not busy trying to cause accidents but I was busy trying to be a responsible bus driver. This game became very serious.\n\nI really enjoy this game. Driving on the highway has never been this calming. You just have to put on some background music and off you go! This game even got me to use blinkers! I have never bothered in any game with blinkers but in this game I really do try my best to keep to the rules of the road.\n\nOfcourse no game is without a flaw or two and the same goes for bus driver. My biggest annoyance with this game is the timer. I understand that, as a bus driver, you need to be on time at the next stop. However, especially in later levels, this is almost impossible to do. Even if you were to drive through red lights (point deduction of 200) you will not make it. I suppose thats realistic as most of the time bus drivers are not in time but seeing as how it does count up at the end of the level I feel that that could have been made a little better. Not to mention that no matter which bus I drive there is an automatic speed limit on it. There are other busses in the same level that are going faster then I am.\n\nAll in all it's a nice game to play.

It lacks any flair or fancy, has no real incentives for the player to actually keep playing, beyond holding off more difficult levels until a few levels from easier tiers are completed, and it's virtually impossible to play without a controller (You can get along fine with just WASD, but good luck braking at red lights/bus stops without being penalised for braking too hard).\nThat being said, it's oddly alright to just waste time and chill in? As a game I didn't even know I had in my steam library until a few weeks ago, it's decent enough. Don't pay full price for it, though. I'm recommending this for anyone who is unsure of playing it after discovering they own it, or for anyone considering purchasing a bundle including this game, or purchasing this game alone when heavily discounted.\n\nTo sum it up in bullet points:\n+ Decent difficulty curve\n+ Has some unexpected variations on some levels\n+ One of the very few driving sim games I've played that actually penalises you for not indicating before switching lanes\n- You essentially -need- a gamepad with pressure sensitivity to play, as keyboard controls mean avoiding braking too hard is near impossible\n- AI vehicles in-game go between 0 and full-speed instantly, making negotiating red lights difficult if there's anyone in front in your lane\n- On some levels, the spawn point is off the side of the road, and you must drive across oncoming traffic to head in the right direction. The game seems unaware that it has imposed this upon you, and will penalise you for driving on the wrong side of the road as you cross over.","May 28, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
