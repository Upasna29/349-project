For the price, I don't really think I can rag on it that much. It is rather short, which I actually liked (and expected).\nI did like the voice-overs; I felt they gave a bit more color and personality to the game.\n\nMy biggest issue is actually that it reminds me a LOT of a free game I played on Kongregate called "The Company of Myself." The gameplay AND story is almost exactly the same... and the Kongregate game had smoother/tighter controls and a much heavier story/ending.\n\nThat said, I was a little disappointed that it didn't seem to have anything fresh or new to add, but for what it was I did enjoy it.","February 20","true","1.2"," 34 of 48 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","34","48","2","5"

The platformer utilizes puzzle based objectives that can only be completed through using 2 characters simultaneously. One character can use his shadow while the other can do an attack, and both characters can perform a double jump.\n\nThe game can be completed in about 1.5 hours or less; which makes the price fair for this title. The gameplay and character attributes were pretty fun, graphics were pleasant and voice acting added a nice touch. The story didn't do it for me and the controls are frustrating and clunky at times; these were the only negatives that popped out.\n\nWorth the $1; but usually on sale for next to nothing!\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

By moving around and copying yourself, you must find your way through the levels.\n\nPlease check out my Quick Review Video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXm6eRrL-98\nYou move around, and then make a shadow of yourself as you return to the starting location. Your shadow carries out the actions you made. You can repeat many times and use your shadows to complete the levels.\n\nPros:\n-Cheap to buy\n-Steam Trading Cards\n-Music was pleasant\n-Good concept with the shadows (reminded me a little of Braid)\n-Simple, casual gameplay if you're looking for something quick\n\nCons:\n-Voice acting was irritating and over-done\n-Short (but for the cost this was expected)\n-Mediocre story\n\nOverall, I did enjoy the gameplay, but wish it had been longer. The voice acting was the most annoying part for me to experience. But after buying the game on sale, and selling the trading cards, it only cost me about $0.30, I feel I got my money's worth.","February 25","true","4.4"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","3"

There is really not much to say about this game so let's keep it short.\nBeautiful concept. It's very simple yet along with great music can really touch your hearth. Short puzzle story about love.\nOk visual design but even less to say about the graphics overall - it's there - and that's basicly it.\nThere are some minor glitches and bugs with movement and as much as i like the way game teaches you controls it's also undercooked and half of it you will get using trials and errors method.\nOverall you should get and try it. I mean for real, it's cheap, it's good rest from bigger titles you play and it's just does marvelous job. I rarely but yet have this weak spot in love, desires, dream area that only few games can spark in strangely touching way and probably last time I felt it in To the Moon, though Broken Dreams definitely ain't as high and it's different in term of gameplay too. Maybe it's stupid, maybe not. Who cares. I will definitely play it some more in next day with fiance.\nEkhm, and not only coz I want do play it with her but because playing 2-player stages on your own is kinda... yea you get it...\nFrankCastle51 out.","February 20","true","11.1"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","14","23","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fiznit/recommended/444480/","fiznit","fizzy flask","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fiznit/","379 products in account","Not worth the dollar. Not sure why this has such rave reviews. Its flash game quality and the core gameplay is using mimics of your past gameplay to climb to new hights. This mechanic has been done by several flash games already and this game doesnt do it very well. The shadow replays dont always follow the same patterns and sometimes you get different outcomes of what they do from the same action This is pretty bad, and makes some of the later puzzles near impossible.\nLevels where you have to platform through a maze of invisible walls and platforms also make sme appearances and I dont see how they could be fun for anyone. Though this game is marked as multiplayer, most of the game only has 1 character and the 2 player puzzles are all babyishly easy. DONT BUY THIS FOR MULTIPLAYER!\nCalming music was ok. Other than that this game was a completely bad experience. You can also probablly clear the game in less than an hour. I gave up after half an hour at which point I had 3 levels left to do. Any time I have logged past that was probablly idling for trading cards. YAY IDLING FOR TRADING CARDS 10/10! :-D","March 27","false","2.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

You follow Jack who is trying to get back to his love Michelle. We will need to use his shadow in a sort of Braid-like gameplay. Well, except when you're controlling both him and Michelle. Then you have to use both WASD and the arrow keys to move them.\n\nThe music, while nice at first, can get a bit repetitive. I'm not really a fan of when you're trying to have a serious story but the characters are saying stuff like, "I can use the right key to get to Michelle" (so as to tell the player the controls). The voice acting feels a little like it was on low quality microphones at times. The backgrounds are quite nice, however the sprites feel fairly downgraded from how they were on Flash/Android.\n\nThe game is a nice little time killer, though some trial and error things may get annoying to you. It's also available for free from the Google Play Store, and as mentioned before it is also available as a Flash game. There are some extra, more challenging, levels in the Steam version though, if you want to try and challenge yourself to those. This gets a weak recommendation from me, but there was some things I definitely didn't enjoy as much.","February 21","true","3.6"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","0"

The mechanics of shadows are interesting, but easy after you get used to it. Some levels were catching and took some minutes to figure out, but they were the minority. Most of them were obvious or just boring. Out of 30, I'd say only 2 or 3 were challenges.\n\nThe story promised well, but made no sense in the end (?). Seemed a metaphor about love and selfishness, but it didn't leave me anything. The protagonist isn't really someone to be remembered too.\nThe music is ok, nothing great, but nothing bad either.\nI actually liked the voice acting, even if sometimes it was overdone, but that's me.\n\nNot worth 1 dollar, I am happy I got it for 35 cents with medal coupons.

The voice acting in the game is.. not great. The shadows that seperate from you and repeat your movements can be buggy, and frustrating at times. The game is the perfect amount of time for a game of this price, I finished about half of it in about a half an hour. There's one thing that made me stop playing, and for gods sake, stop putting invisable mazes in games. The invisable maze in this game is a pain, not to mention (I suppose) you need to use the shadow dupes to get through. If you're consistent with platformers, and have the extra money, I'd recommend this game despite it's flaws.","February 20","true","0.4"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","12","22","2","0"

The shadow is needed to complete puzzles too. whenever you are using the shadow it will be like a ghost which is doing the exact same walking patterns as you did. Sometimes you need them to step on those head in order to move on. Like making a bridge. It somehow sometimes reminds me of the lemmings but its not close to that. The game is very short and levels are quite easy to beat. There are around 30 levels and you are able to complete the game in less then a hour. For it's price i think it is worth it.\n\nFully voiced over sound.\nText font is really terrible and difficult to read.\nMusic is repititve and there is only 1 track.\nGame is short.\nSimple Controls.\n\n\n\nOther things.\nMusic could be annoying after awhile.\nYou can't have a gangbang with your shadows.\nI Completed the game in 47 Minutes.\n\nPlaythrough: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NibBgtURKyk\n\n-------------------\n\nI Give this game a 7/10","April 7","true","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I really like this game, I love this style of puzzle game and the voice acting (for the guy anyway) is pretty solid and adds to the feel of the game. The art style is pretty nice and the music is calming. I'd give this a 9/10. For a cheap little game it is quite satisfying.","April 7","true","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You create "shadows" of your character that serve as platforms to higher areas, in order to beat most of the levels you will have to do it multiple times. It only took an hour to beat the whole game but i enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who fancies an uncomplicated experience which puts you in a happy mood.","February 21","true","3.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"
