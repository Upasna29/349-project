This is the game for you.\nAll the tables are based on real tables, and does a pretty good job of it. So after playing the tables in this game, you already know what to shoot for out in the real world, and your scores will be that much greater.\nHowever, Make sure you run this game in DX11, and make sure you adjust the lighting. (I usually go for 10-15% room brightness and 90-100% lamp brightness, to better emulate how games typically will look like in the real world.)\n\n\nNow for the bad parts. (Why you shouldn't buy this game)\n\nDX11\nMost people will not know how to run this game in DX11, so the game will look like crap tbh. And when you see the same machine in the real world, it will not look familiar at first. (because in RL it will be much darker.) in short, this game will not look like the screenshots to most people. (I'm sure this issue will eventually be addressed.)\n\nPricing\nMy biggest complaint here is that you have to pay extra to get access to "Pro-menus"\nThis means you can't tweak the tables to match Tournament settings, where extra balls are usually turned off. This is the biggest complaint I have about that. Some might argue, but I feel this is just a moneygrab.\n\nFPS\nThe game is locked at max 60fps. As someone who has been used to playing at 120fps on another game, this looks terrible. When the ball moves quickly across the table it looks like a series of frames, not movement. Not only does this look bad, but diminishes the feel of the game. For something intended to emulate real world pinball, this is something that need to be improved. Monitors with higher refresh rates are more and more common, and is cheaper than ever, as monitor makers now focuses on 4k and g-sync/free-sync.\n\nNudging = unrealistic\nIn this game, nudging shakes the table and moves the ball a bit afterwards. In the real world, you shake the table a bit, but the ball will just stay in place. (like moving a carpet under a ball, the ball just rolls in place dues to the inertia of the ball, and pinball are quite heavy.) So in the real world, you nudge a part of the machine into the ball to make it move, like a bumper, wall or the flipper. (I make a point of only nudging when "slap saving" or a wall/bumper would hit the ball to move it. So that I don't develop any unrealistic habits for when I play RL tables.)\n\nPhysics are generally bad.\nIt does a good job of trying to emulate the feel of playing a real table, but combined with 60fps, the collision handling is just horrible. Many times the ball has moved into the same space of the flipper, resulting in the ball shooting off in the direction nearest to open space. Like straight through the object, out the other side. (the nudging doesn't even follow any laws of physics.)\n\n3D\nAlthough you can play the game in 3D, like with Nvidia 3D vision, the game consists of 2D objects, albeit layered. So although bumpers and ramps stick "out", they are still 2D flat. The ramps looks especially dull.\n\n\nConclusion.\n+ If you want something that emulates real pinball, this is definately the game for you. Buy it!\n- If you want a pinball game that looks better, plays better and takes advantage of all the possibilities a pinball game on the computer can give you. You might not want to buy this game.\n\nBut overall, this is still a fun game to play, even if this is the "second" pinball game you buy ;)","September 13, 2015","true","385.2"," 64 of 72 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","64","72","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sysg3n/recommended/238260/","Sysg3n","Sysgen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sysg3n/","4617 products in account","As pinball goes the game play is terrific and Pinball Arcade has been absent from Steam for far too long.  The fact that it had to go through Greenlight is more testament to Valve's incompetence and lack of understanding of the genre.\n\nFarsight includes a free table with the distribution of their platform.  Tales of Arabian Nights is outrageously good.  Personally I can sit in one spot from dusk until dawn ignoring hunger or nature calling playing this table.  The music, sound and game-play are all top notch.  Unfortunately the pot ain't all roses and there are some weeds, hopefully not permanently.\n\nGraphically the package is a disappointment.  I don't know much about the studio but there are many aspects of the package that are missing or not up to par and diminish what should be one the premier titles on the steam store.\n\nThe game has shipped with post-processing bug so you must turn off this feature (some tables)  which denigrates the graphical presentation even further.  Still, when it works post-processing is no more than a gimmick to cover up the textural inadequacies of the tables.\n\nThe distribution model of the tables created quite a stir when Pinball Arcade made it's Steam debut.  Table packages were treated as IAPs or in app purchases and not as Steam recognized downloadable content.  Problems with this model included the inability to send Steam gifts or the guarantee that tables would be available if Farsight ever went under though I'm unsure exactly where IAP content is hosted.  The claim for the model was said to be based on that there were too many table packages in too many configurations, "normal" vs "pro"  (more on that will follow), table packs, season packs, custom ball packs.   Farsight responded and negotiated a compromise with Valve where the "normal" and "pro" season packs would be published as official Steam downloadable content and each would have it's own product page.  Personally I'm waiting for this to happen before buying any tables.  The rest would remain as IAPs, still a concern.\n\nThe "normal" and "pro" packages just seem unnecessary and unwarranted.  Do people who buy the "normal" tables not want the ability to scan the tables or occasionally fiddle with the menu?  Sure, I understand that such features are not absolute must haves but the classification of the packages without these features as "normal" is misguided and has been mishandled.  Lacking such features in a pinball package is not "normal" and paying up to 75% more for them is wrong and further, should not be marketed to me as "pro".  It's a joke and an insult to fans of the studio.\n\nUsually I'm all in for this genre.  I would of gladly purchased all of their content day one but their incompetent marketing has left a bad taste.  I will own all of the "pro" tables but I'm not paying a mark-up for a faux "pro" marketing technique meant to take advantage of the naive consumer.  I would of bought the package at the "pro" unit price if there was no such demarcation between "normal and "pro" but I'll wait for the "pro" season discount.  If that never comes then so be it.  It's principle and besides, the free table , "pro" mind you, Tales of Arabian Knights is just remarkable, so no rush.\n\nPinball Arcade without question is the best pinball experience to be had.  That's no offense to my friends @ZEN with have worked hard and put out a quality product as well.  In many aspects ZEN's product presentation is vastly superior.  The question is can Farsight deliver more than their excellent engine.  Can they improve the presentation, the interface, improve the distribution of their downloadable content,  improve the textures and lighting of their tables.  Provide Steam integration in the form of Steam friends leader-boards and make the Steam leader-boards just for Steam users, not lump us in with phone and tablet users.\n\nGet your act together Farsight.  Your product does not cast a positive light on your studio.  We expect a polished product.  Pinball Arcade is not that polished product though the pinball is stupendous.\n\nAddendum: February 19th, 2014: A Steam friends list implementation has been effected, however it is not integrated meaning you have to be logged into a Farsight account. Your Steam friends show with their Farsight names, therefore your friends may not be recognizable. The posted scores are not Steam specific in that if a friend plays on another platform such as IOS, the scores will show as well.   This implementation is a step in the right direction but it is not optimal.\n\nAddendum: September 30th, 2014:  Sometime ago FS corrected the issue with not being able to recognize Steam friends.\n\nAddendum: April 17th, 2015:  DX11 Beta is here and the difference in graphic fidelity is huge.  Good work Farsight.  The update was a long time coming but much appreciated.","November 11, 2013","true","298.0"," 168 of 230 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","168","230","0","22"

Very fun! It has a much different feel than Pinball FX 2, if you own that,  the flipper and ball action will feel much different. More of a feel of a real pinball machine. It took me a few weeks to get totally used to it and now the differences don't bother me. So if you do purchase the game give it some time to get the feel for it and th adjustment will happen. The graphics and sound are good, most of the tables I have (I have pack one only) feel just like they did when I played the real thing years ago. I enjoy nearly all the tables in pack one except for 3 or 4 of them.

The ball felt a little light. Maybe I just got use to the physics of the FX2 ball, but regardless, I still enjoyed the game. I've played other pinball games where the ball just doesn't feel right at all, and it ruins the entire game.\n\nI grew up during the arcade era. I immediately recognized a ton of tables I would see and wanted to play, but didn't due to me being so bad at pinabll, that i'd just end up wasting the $1 my dad would give me and just play for like 5 mins. He was good at pinball, he would constantly earn free games that he would let me have after he was done with his original credit.\n\nThere's not much to say really. If you like pinbal, this game is worth a shot. It's really nice how they recreated real tables. It's hard for people not to compare this game with FX2. They're both good pinball games that offer something different. FX offering stuff that could never be produced in a real table, like beaming down your ball in a light saber. I personally like that, but could also go for a bit more realistic experience. This definitely makes you feel like you have one of those giant pinball machines in your home.","June 22, 2014","true","5.6"," 36 of 45 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","36","45","0","1"

It is what it is.\n\nAs a small child I spent much of my time at the beach resorts of Myrtle Beach & Surfside Beach, both (then) small towns in South Carolina, USA. Their beachfront pavillions were filled with 10-cent wonders at a time when children of any age could wander freely, alone. I remember the feeling of a pocket full of parent's pennies, waiting to to be magically converted to dimes for 4-in-a-strip sepia photos, flattened friendship tokens, skeeball to be turned into tickets (never really understanding why banked shots worked best), shooting galleries with actual pellets, and most magical of all, pinball. And spending those dimes with the feeling of a slight sunburn in a time when we still had ozone, but didn't yet have sunscreen. And going home when the pennies, and most of the magic, were gone, fingertips smelling like stale tobacco, having spent the last dimes on snowcones.\n\nA week ago these memories were undescribable, and quit vague. Then I acquired Pinball Arcade, and all these memories became so very, very real. And memories about becoming a teenager, meeting girls (or wishing to), learning to drive, going to the prom. Going to bars for the first time, usually alone. But even when alone, pinball was there to comfort me when I was unable to talk to girls. Pinball as a way to meet other guys like me that may have never been my friends otherwise. Yes, these VERY tables, over several decades.\n\nSo I thank Pinball Arcade for reminding me of the pain, and the absolute joy, of childhood, adolesence, and growing into adulthood in a way that nothing else on Earth could have reminded me. Thank you for the pinball, and for allowing me to express myself in this pseudo-review.","September 24, 2014","true","110.0"," 38 of 49 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","38","49","0","5"

I first fell in love with it on the Playstation 3 and eventually moved to the Steam version, which I like much more. I highly recommend getting the season packages. In fact, this is put out by a fairly small outfit with a lot of dedication and passion for pinball, so I pay extra for the pro pack to help support them. I don't even mess with the extra stuff that comes with the pro, except maybe ball skins. They're just worth it.\n\nIf you don't know, buying a past season gives you all the games from that season, since they've already released. Your game (Pinball Arcade) updates a few minutes after your purchase, so there isn't an install, unless things have changed since I bought one last. If you buy the current season, there may only be a few games but be patient. Similar to a current season of TV episodes, the games are still being released and you'll get them as they come until the purchased season is over. It gives you something to look forward to!\n\nAs an 80s kid, I didn't have money for plunking into pinball or arcade machines. I was one of those who would stand around and watch others play, just to feel the excitement. My father worked in a factory and would sometimes bring home an actual pinball that popped out of a big machine on occasion. I settled for rolling that around on the floor (sad, I know!)\n\nBut now, I have more than I could ever dream at my fingertips! And they're so realistic! Farsight takes the actual tables and dissects them, ensuring we get as authentic an experience as possible besides playing the real thing. And while owning real pinball machines sounds great, think of the upkeep and expense, not to mention the room you'd need. It's a romantic thought, but this is way better.\n\nI have a number of pinball video games, but there are two that rule supreme for me: Pinball FX2 (Zen) and Pinball Arcade. I love Zen Pinball for the fantasy angle. They make excellent tables that never existed so anything is possible, especially with Marvel and Star Wars! But when I want to play something that was actually crafted and made the rounds back when I was wishing I could play, that's when Pinball Arcade comes through for me.\n\nI play using a Logitech Gamepad F310, by the way, and it works great!\n\nThis is my first time actually sitting down and writing a review here (I think), so I hope it was worth a poop.","September 2, 2015","true","11.4"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","21","24","3","0"

However, as I  got to play more of the tables from all of the initial seasons 1,2 and 3, I found many of the tables were brilliant and played almost like the real thing.  I can actually remember a couple of the tables  contained within this series from my days as a student.  There's a wide variety of table types and apart from a couple that I found difficult to  keep the pinballs in play, most were  a pleasure to play.  The graphics may be slightly  rougher than Pinball FX, but I think that's because the developer has tried to capture the original feel of the tables rather than create totally  new digital only tables[ it works.\n\nI have found the  high score achievements  in the main were very easy to acquire.  As for pledging money towards  development of more tables for future  seasons. if you buy the seasons on Steam, you pay for all future  tables that are to be added to that season, so beware when backing the tables via Kickstarter.    I've backed  four or five tables via Kickstarter, not realizing they were part of the same Pinball Arcade set as the Steam version, which I purchased earlier this year when they were released,  so I've wasted a good $100 which could have been spent buying at least a couple of the Pro season packs.\n\nI mentioned this to the  developers, who have been really good about it and  offered extra's, or the option to gift  the tables I've backed that i already purchased via Steam.\n\nOne positive that the FX tables have over the arcade version is that you can buy  most of the tables seperately, which means you can build up your collection slowly; very useful if you are strapped for cash.  That said, overall  I think the season packs that   you get for the Pinball  Arcade version are much better value for money.\n\n\nOnce all of season 4's tables are added there will be over 50 tables to play.  The first of season 4 has already been added, i.e.  'Phantom of the Opera', the last of Season three was added recently i.e.  'Bram Stokers Dracula'.   Don't   be scared off by the price of these  season packs, when you consider how many tqables are contained within each pack you'll realise  that they  are excellent value for money; moreso if you buy them in a sale later this year.  Season 4 will probably be excluded from the sales,  at least until it's got it's full complement of tables, (10 in all).  The main difference between the  season packs and the Pro packs is that you get  lots of extra's such as  selectable balls, backgrounds etc.  You may be able to purchase these balls as packs via the basic version of the game, but i can't say for certain as I purchased the Pro versions.  I did have to buy one of the ball packs, but it was  dirt cheap (£0.69).\n\n\nCheck out some videos of game play:\n\n\n[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnmQEgO5Zag][b]Bram Stokers Dracula[/b][/url]\n[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xQyXa3vO0][b]Junk Yard[/b][/url]\n[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV4KsPqh0yg][b]Phantom of the Opera[/b][/url]\n[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUskwM5iOjQ][b]Diner[/b][/url]\n[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SkixSnzvyM][b]Fun House[/b][/url]\n[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf5ZzDbIxNA][b]Harley Davidson 3rd Edition[/b][/url]\n[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Qb_2wq_qI][b]Attack from Mars[/b][/url]\n[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXfCLX8TYt8][b]Terminator 2[/b][/url]\n[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDVX3zVES6E][b]Black Knight 2000[/b][/url]\n[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVkiWyH7i60][b]High Roller Casino[/b]\n[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf0a4W5dmVU][b]Cue Ball wizard[/b]\n[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dq4QvsWYWvs][b]Fish Tales[/b]\n[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnRXbUmaIe0][b]Cirqus Voltaire[/b]\n[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG73i6U2tSQ][b]Star Trek: The Next Generation[/b]\n[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyza_2eVY9A][b]Flight 2000[/b]\n[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6PhTtiam9Y][b]Taxi[/b]\n[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxvKvEqWbnA][b]Cactus Canyon[/b]\n[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SNzBBgy_hQ][b]Medieval Madness[/b]\n[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVsJGnX_1OQ][b]Pin*Bot[/b]","October 12, 2014","true","34.6"," 31 of 42 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","31","42","0","9"

It's just one of those things you have to persevere with. If you do, you will be rewarded with an experience that hones your instincts like a sport. There is strategy to it, patience, luck, and the need for twitch reflexes. Basically, everything's a target and you are constantly scoring points and bonuses, so it has a highly addictive effect on the reward system of your brain.\n\nA great deal of production time was invested in making the original pinball machines, and that finds its way into the game. Buying all of the tables in Pinball Arcade may seem expensive to some people, but compared to the cost of owning dozens of actual pinball tables, it is extremely cheap. You can even play the table Tales of the Arabian Nights for free. Some of the tables are works of art in game form, and most people will not encounter pinball machines in their local area the way they used to up until the late 1990s.\n\nThe tables in Pinball Arcade are replicas of ones from the stables of Williams, Gottlieb, Bally, Stern, Data East, and Sega. Farsight Studios (the company behind Pinball Arcade) have produced a string of previous games that attempt to achieve authenticity and pay homage to the history and culture of pinball.\n\nPinball Arcade plays more like real pinball than any other pinball video game does. It manages to look fantastic without adding a layer of graphical effects that couldn't be incorporated into real tables. The tables appear mechanical, although they are of course simulated. The relatively accurate physics programmed in means the ball behaves quite realistically. I think most people who have played much real pinball would agree that Pinball Arcade is the closest simulation out, and the next best thing to real pinball.\n\nLike most other pinball games, there is a lot crammed into an area that's a different shape to a landscape orientation monitor. Thankfully, in Pinball Arcade, you can swivel the monitor 90° into portrait mode if you have that kind of monitor. Even without this, the game is highly enjoyable and without doubt the best pinball video game yet made, in my opinion.","November 4, 2013","true","145.4"," 61 of 96 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","61","96","0","1"

Not only do they stick to their promise of authetic tables, they deliver an extremely satisfying experience with them too.\n\nPinball Arcade is classified as "Free to Play" with an initial free offering with "Tales of the Arabian Nights" table that is in no way limited. You have a full table that happens to be one of the most popular tables ever made! The table in itself is certainly a dream to play on with changing skill-shots and a number of stories that you progress through as you play.\n\nOther tables are available for purchase which will provide for many other experiences. My absolute favorite table, "Cirqus Voltaire" is bundled in with the also-amazing "Funhouse" which is probably the easiest $5 to spend on anything in this set.\n\nThe physics feel great, and with the recent addition of vibration through Xbox 360 controllers (or other controllers), it gets as close to playing the original thing as you can get. Visually a lot of these tables are not only faithful, but extremely good looking, the post processing alone giving the harsher glare that I remember from the original table in itself, and even better is that care was made to ensure that the dot-matrix-display was embedded in "Cirqus Voltaire" as it should be.\n\nThe one downside at the moment is that there is no "cabinet" orientation, meaning that for the time being the tables will have to be played in a standard aspect ratio (4:3, 16:9, 16:10). It has been said that there will be an update that not only offers a cabinet orientation, but that it will also use dual screens so that the game can be used in dedicated virtual pinball cabinets with one simulating the table, and the other simulate the backboards.\n\nThis is an extremely well done simulator for pinball. While competitors may be good with their own works, Pinball Arcade flies by in a stunning fashion with licensed tables that are faithful, beautiful, and always work. There's more to come too, with the possibilities of "The Addams Family" and other major tables coming in as well!","November 7, 2013","true","11.8"," 60 of 101 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","60","101","0","0"

Pinball Hall Of Fame Gotlieb Collection and Pinball Hall Of Fame Williams Collection from the PS2 system with some added tables that you may have heard of before. There are about 21 tables total from what I counted and all faithfully play to the original tables. However depending on your system , if you think you meet the system requirements - Be ready for slowdown at certain momemnts of the game if your system resolution is very very high. If your on a machine that barely go over the system requirements, do Windowed full screen mode at the highest screen res you can do, this will turn off V Sync and provide a more smooth experience at the cost of minor screen tearing.\n\nI applaud Farsight Studios for bringing these games to the PC and this sale was killer but I was ultimately was dissapointed at the price point which may scare lots of people off due to its $30 price tag per pack. $4.99 is too expensive for individual tables that only give access to 2 tables most.

It is the closest I've ever come to playing a real pinball table in a virtual environment. While the game can't quite recreate all of the unusual ball physics you might see in a real table (such as smacking the ball against the topglass on freak bounces), it does as good a job as you could expect for a computer. Not only that, but you can always be sure that the parts for your table are in perfect working order, which is not something that can be said of random tables in an arcade.\n\nEvery table is not only lovingly reproduced here, but you get extras such as detailed instructions on how to play the table, how each game mode works and a general understanding that not only helps you in the game but if you encounter the real tables as well. With a bit of work, you can even play in portrait mode on a side-rotated monitor for a beautiful lengthened table experience. The still images on the store page here really don't do justice to the program in action.\n\nThe awesome part is that you don't have to just take my word for it; the game comes with Tales of the Arabian Nights for free, which allows you to really get a feel for what the game is capable of. The other tables have to be bought and on their own, the packs seem a bit on the pricy side (especially since I've never seen them on sale), but when you consider what you're getting, the cost per table is $1.50 or less--the cost of three plays in an actual arcade--which is really a steal when you consider what goes into the creation of each table. The Pro options open up some new features that are fantastic for true pinball afficionados, but for those who just want to play the tables as they might find them in an arcade (and not be able to switch things up as if they owned the table themselves), they aren't really necessary.\n\nFor those considering buying, Season 1 just slightly edges out Season 2 by virtue of having more tables as well as the inclusion of such greats as Bride of Pin-Bot and Twilight Zone. As of the time of this review, Season 3 is for sale but its contents haven't been decided. I actually own tables for the game on a console, so I haven't gotten around to picking them up on PC yet.\n\nIf you enjoy real or digital pinball, there's no reason that you shouldn't download this and give the free table included a shot.","December 26, 2013","true","9.9"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

As much as I looked forward to Pinball Arcade's PC release, I was equally disappointed at the poor quality of the release.  Bad lighting, no customizable camera movement, a lack of a decent operator menu for the tables and very shoddy, bug ridden or just plain incomplete translations of some games.\n\nIn addition, you have to create a separate account to keep track of leaderboard scores and you have to add money to your steam wallet to buy individual tables.  On top of this , they won't allow you to buy single tables so you're forced to get one table for $5 and you're often stuck with a second table you don't care about.\n\nNotice the reviews they cite? "Mobile Game of the year?" Plus, IGN's review is gushing over the (much better) PS4 version, not the PC version.\n\nOne of the tables are free so try it for yourself.  Then fire up a game like Pro Pinball: Timeshock, Big Race USA, or Fantastic Journey and you'll see how good pinball can be.

Free demo versions that allow one to play up to the first high score are also available for each table.\n2)    Like Visual Pinball, The Pinball Arcade's tables are recreations from real tables that I grew up with. They are not impossible virtual creations that are made much easier in order to expand pinball appeal to a larger audience. If that is 'your bag', check out Pinball FX2.\n3)    Although much of this subjective, The Pinball Arcade's implementation feels more polished than Visual Pinball.  One example is how the lighting on the board is 3D rendered. Visual Pinball's table-lighting effects are statically added using an image tool. Although the ball physics could probably be proved to be superior (one way or the other) mathematically, I can only say that I find the ball behavior of The Pinball Arcade to feel more realistic. That is not a slam. I would expect that a product that had developers paid to work on it all day every day would have more polish than a product whose developers are contributing “as they have time”.\n4)    Plug and Play. Download and launch. It’s that simple. On the other hand, Visual Pinball takes quite a bit of R&D to get going (even with an abundance of available documentation). That said, Visual Pinball is worth every bit of blood, sweat, and tears that are required to it going.\n5)    Supporting TPA (The Pinball Arcade) is really good for the game. The fact that it is available on just about every mobile platform has really rekindled pinball interest with the masses.\n\nCons\n1)    The tables are pretty expensive unless you buy a season at a time.\n2)    The tables are not stored with a "Pinball Arcade account"; but rather, the store for which you purchased the engine that plays the tables. On one hand, I would expect to be able to buy the content in the cloud (like an Amazon kindle book) and then play it on any device that had the kindle app (buying the version of the app native to that platform if necessary). On the other hand, extra maps for Call of Duty on PC, Xbox, and Playstation do not transfer between each other. At $30 a season, I'm going to have to pick just one platform. I am probably choosing Steam since I can at least go from PC/Mac (with XArcade Tankstick) and use a Netbook on the go. Then again, I'd much rather use a tablet for mobile. So, I may go with TPA on iOS for mobile and stick with Visual Pinball on the desktop.","November 18, 2014","true","17.0"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","1"

The lights, sounds, backglass art, ball physics, flippers, tilt inertia, everything. These are licenced, authentic replicas of actual pinball tables like you would find in the arcade.\n\nThis is a game for people who want the feel of an actual, physical pinball table--maybe to practice and learn the rules and scoring of individual tables, or just to play in lieu of paying 50 cents a game at the arcade. If you're looking for pinball that plays like a video game, this isn't it. Some tables are unforgiving, complicated, and skills like flipper control can take a long time to master (just like their real counterparts).\n\nMost people look at the DLC prices and go "what the hell, $120 for pinball?" It seems like a lot compared to typical games, but it really isn't for a game like this. The $30 DLC is for around 20 tables per pack, and individual tables can be unlocked for a few dollars. You can demo any table you want, with the only restrictions being a score cap that will stop play if your score exceeds the high score list. A real pinball machine is usually 50 cents a play, so it's not uncommon to spend $20 a night on pinball in the arcade. When you look at this this way, it's a steal to be able to practice and play at home for the price. Remember, these are actual, licensed, replicated machines, not something some programmer thought up in their basement. Note that if you want to buy a table pack, you can buy either the regular or "pro" pack, you don't need both, so the total DLC pricing appears as about twice what it actually is. The pro pack has no impact on the games themselves, but it does give you other options like being able to modify some of the table settings, like tilt control.\n\nThis includes "Tales of the Arabian Nights" already unlocked and ready to play. Purely personal opinion, but Theater of Magic, Scared Stiff, and Bride of Pin-Bot are great tables for brand new players--fairly simple, the production value is great, and even if you have bad aim, there's plenty to hit. Here is a IPDB's list of the top 10 rated pinball games if you're looking for some new tables to master:\n\n#1 	Twilight Zone\n#2	Medieval Madness\n#3	Theatre of Magic\n#4	Monster Bash\n#5	Star Trek: The Next Generation\n#6	The Addams Family\n#7	White Water\n#8	Indiana Jones: The Pinball Adventure\n#9	Tales of the Arabian Nights\n#10	Star Trek (Enterprise Limited Edition)","October 25, 2014","true","10.1"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","0"

You know, without the bar, the rye, or the cigarettes. Maybe some 80s tunes, if nobody's around.\n\nI don't know how the makers of this game got the licenses to those Williams pinballs, but I really wish they hadn't. The execution here is barely adequate at every turn, in stark contrast to the overall excellent (which is something I never thought I'd say for a Microsoft Studios game) Pinball FX2. How is this game disappointing, specifically?\n\nWell: the UI doesn't work properly, in addition to being just plain ugly. Try changing key bindings, if you want an exercise in frustration. There doesn't seem to be any nod whatsoever to the sorts of niceties that Steam supports, utterly unlike the incredibly well-done leaderboard/friend functionality in Pinball FX2. The physics are just... wrong. The ball doesn't react to 'gravity' in a convincing way, and it only takes seconds of play for the illusion to be broken. The ball shudders and strobes as it 'rolls' in exactly the sort of way a real ball doesn't. Textures are inconsistent, weirdly low-resolution all over the place, and the lighting model is... odd. The 'room' in which the pinball table stands sports textures right out of the early 90s. Maybe that's a sly nod to the time period, but I doubt it.\n\nThis is, as far as I can tell, a straight-across port of the iPad game, right down to the touch-centric interface. But a game that looked and sounded adequate on an iPad2, and was worth every cent of the price -- free -- just doesn't cut it on a modern gaming PC without an attempt at least a little polish.\n\nWorst of all, if you're a Williams afficionado, at least, is that they utterly failed to capture the truly distinct and unique feel of Williams machine flippers. Which is doubly ironic, because in playing Pinball FX2 for the last week or so, one thing I actually said to myself was "these flippers feel just like Williams' used to".\n\nBut to add insult to mediocrity, to actually get to play the Williams lineup of tables -- how I miss you, Pinbot! or Black Knight! -- the publishers of this game expect you to fork out $160 (Edit: 'only' $70 to $90, apparently) in DLC.\n\nAre you high, guys? Seriously?\n\nThere is no way I can recommend this game to anyone but the most serious pinball fans, and even then, even though you might recapture some of the memories they're expecting you to pay through the nose for, you're going to be disappointed with the lack of polish and the pretty significant technical failings.\n\nIf this goes on sale, with all $160 (edit: $70 to $90, apparently) worth of DLC (so far), for maybe 10 bucks, sometime, it might be worth it. But putting the lipstick of a reasonable price on it still won't make the cynical laziness of execution here any more attractive. Playing this for the few minutes left me more annoyed than anything else -- I hope if you take the plunge for the one free table at least, you have a better time with it.","November 26, 2013","false","0.2"," 105 of 190 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","105","190","2","6"

For example, the flippers in the game are bouncy as they should be, but they completely lack the rubbery friction which is so important when you're trying to catch the ball.\n\nThe controls are nowhere near as responsive as a pinball game requires. Tried with both a normal ♥♥♥♥♥♥ keyboard and an Xbox 360 controller. The controller was better, but it simply wasn't possible for me to play with the keyboard.","September 15, 2015","false","15.6"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","0"

I've played enough of this game to get a general impression of the quality.  I had downloaded it years ago but thought the price of the packs were too high so I uninstalled it.  I recently got an urge to play pinball so I purchased Pinball FX2 as it was cheaper and had good reviews.  While Pinball FX2 is a good game (I bought about eight tables), I found it a bit gimmicky.  I had only played the free Arabian table on Pinball Arcade and thought it was O.K. but it wasn't enough to convince me to spend the bucks to buy a pack.  But I did some research and read some reviews and in the end I took the plunge and bought Season Pack One.  Boy am I glad I did because it is really good.  The authenticity of the tables I find amazing and it has to be as close to playing the real classic pinball tables on a pc as you can get.  I found Pinball FX2 to be more flash over substance where as Pinball Arcade is more of a passion of love.  I read some reviews complaining about a 'delay' in the flippers but that is all part of the authenticity.  On the old pinball machines it was all mechanical so it would seem like a 'delay' anyway because of the moving parts.\n\nAs for the price, for the £22.99 or so I paid for pack one, I got about 21 tables so that works out at about a pound per table which is very good value for money.  The price may seem high but it is totally worth it.  A single table on Pinball FX2 starts at about £1.99 so it is a no-brainer.\n\nI'm just pretty amazed by the realism of the tables - very impressive !\n\nEdit (4/5/2016)\n\nAfter some more game time I am updating my review.  I have now tried out a lot of the tables on Pinball Arcade and whilst they are still very good, my only gripe is that they seem to all be retro tables.  I wish there were more modern tables but all the tables seem to be pre-1980's.  Anyway, I played Pinball FX2 some more and found a table view I liked and after playing it some more I found it to be more enjoyable than previously thought and not so gimmicky.\n\nSo my final conlusion is if you want a retro and realistic pinball simulator with lots of classic tables, than Pinball Arcade is the one to go for, but if you want modern mechanics and tables, then Pinball FX2 is the one to go for.","April 30","true","2.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","2"

Growing up, I had a huge interest in Computers and Video Games. However my true passion was always Pinball. My first computer was a commodore 64 which I got for Christmas of 1983. The first real game I purchased for the C64 was EA's Pinball Construction Set  PC Link Here [www.myabandonware.com].  It was simple as hell, but still you were able to create multiball games with it.\n\nAbout 10 years ago I was introducted to Visual Pinball which blew my mind, free pinball tables that can be created by everyone and anyone with an interest and started out banging tables I remembered creating in the 80's using PCS, then onto Future pinball and anything else that tried to recreate that feeling of real play.\n\nFast forward to today and we have finally have TPA on the PC and nothing out there has yet to even come close to this;  I mean it may not be perfect (DX11), I can think of many things that should be added (Cabinet Mode.) However it has been a start to a near perfect Authenic Collection of pinball tables recreated for the PC.\n\nOne addition I would love to see with TPA is side by side double player action with my steam friends, where each player plays on the left or right side of the screen, multi screen or even each player having its own window. I cannot see it taking up much bandwith and this would be excellent for tournaments and competition events. Are there any others who share this same type of interest.\n\nHere is a some Canadian Badass trivia.

Say you buy a season for $30 and like two of the tables enough to play them regularly, you easily got the same entertainment value as you would have gotten from buying a couple other individual games.

It's not free unless your idea of fun is playing a few minutes of each game and then stopping.   I guess everyone has access to at least one pinball table for free, but "Arabian Nights" isn't my favorite table really, so I can't imagine anyone just playing that table over and over.\n\nStill, it's got a great collection of real simulated pinball tables with some classics going back to the earliest days of pinball to more modern releases that you might remember from 20 years ago.  (Do they still make pinball tables? It has been so long since I've been out to an arcade or even a bar that would have one to know)\n\nAnyway, some particularly good pinball tables to mention:  Star Trek:TNG, Black Knight 2000, Terminator, Elvira and the party monsters, Creature from the Black Lagoon, No Good Gofers, Funhouse, and Champion Pub.  Some of these I remember playing the actual table and it does a good job of bringing back the feeling of playing (minus the loss of quarters from my pockets) and others I discovered from playing them in this collection.\n\nThere are table packs, and "seasons" you can buy into, and even in the seasons you can choose the regular or the "pro" version.  It's obvious why you'd want to buy the seasons instead of the individual tables (you save some cash) but why would you want the pro version?  Supposedly there's a few tables with some not-so-nice words that are spoken, and the pro versions allow you to unlock this (I heard, but could be wrong) and the pro version allows you to mess with the table mechanics more and "cheat".\n\nWhile it might be nice to have the pro version, it's not a necessity.\n\nAt the time of this writing they are just beginning season 4.  I've got all of them up to the end of season 3, and I will probably eventually get season 4.  If you're a fan of real pinball machines, check this out.  If you're a fan of old pinball machines or rare pinball machines, check this out.

Of course, you can get a package that saves you TON OF MONEY, by paying about 25 euroes and receiving 10 tables.\n\nIf you do not pay, you can play effectively for about 5 minutes of time since there is a highscore cap you can reach before the game boots you out, but hey, you are able to repeat this countless of times!\nYou cannot save your highscore since you haven't payed, but there is one (1.) free table you can play.\n\nThere are aparently some other free tables, which you have to find in the sea of pay to play ones, but I managed it. After I found one free table, it also asked me to purchase it. Bug or feature, I have no idea.\n\nThe game itself is not that bad, graphics and gameplay are both decent. Camera is a bit tricky on some tables because it automatically follows the ball to certain edge of the table, making it really awkward to use the flippers as the ball comes back. Controls are quite simple and easy to use, although they are not what I would assume them to be.\n\nOverall:\nIf you are not a pinball fanatic who has mountains of cash to burn, I recommend avoiding this game.\n\n\nEDIT1 - For the developers:\n\nThe game is pretty bad with its current system, however, it has potential.\nHere are some of things I believe should be done in order to sell the game better and make it more successful:\n\n1. Remove the message on start up. No one likes a self brag.\n2. Cut the game and sell it. The game doesn't really need 3.5GB to operate, when a person that downloads it uses only 1 table. Also, why is this game free? It obviously is made with the intention to sell and that is alright. Put the price on the game, 5eur. Comes with 5 tables, Nothing else. Make DLC's containing 10 tables each that would upgrade to the game and sell them at whatever price you wish.\n3. Release a Demo. Allow players to download a free demo, containing only 1 free table - how it comes now.\n4. Do not bug the players to purchase ingame. It is offsetting.

First world problems, I know. =P\n\nI purchased 2 tables (bride of Pinbot and medieval madness) on a recomendation for like $4.99 for both and imho these tables were a steal. If I would have just tried these boards on the trial I wouldnt have bought them because the amount of time it takes to really see how the board works is much more than the trial gives you.\n\nSo, I would recomend asking people who've played or watching some youtube videos before picking what to buy because it really can be confusing.\n\nAs far as how good these tables are compared to  the originals they are based on- I have no idea.

Everytime I play that table, once I hit over 200 million, there are no more pinballs for me to play with. All you do is hear the music, watch the probes move back and forth, and nothing happens. You can "call an attendant," but since no ball is visably stuck on the screen, you're screwed. It's a shame that if you do well on a very popular table, all of your success is wiped out on a glitch.\n\nThis problem has been around for years with this table, and other tables if you check around, and I thought someone at Williams ( or whoever is in charge of software quality control ) would try to fix the problem by now.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rasufelle/recommended/238260/","rasufelle","Guerilla Grue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rasufelle/","909 products in account","HOLY. COW.\n\nI've always enjoyed pinball games. Unfortunately, given the fact I live in a very rural area I've always had to make do with video game pinball tables, only having played real physical units a time or three. Despite that the history and design of the real tables have always fascinated me, and I've longed for a way I could experience some of the real classics.\n\nWell, here's the answer.\n\nIn terms of production values as a video game Pinball Arcade is a little lacking in some areas. Overall visual fidelity isn't the greatest given the simplicity of its subject matter, and in all honesty the presentation of the game's menus isn't the most user friendly, with a strangely syrupy-feeling lag between menu selection inputs and their taking effect on-screen. In-game, though, things are completely different, with tight controls and a solidly reliable camera that makes actually playing the tables themselves a joy. Perhaps its simply my inexperience, but the physics of the tables do, at times, feel a bit on the floaty side, however.\n\nWhat really takes the cake in the game's presentation, at least for me, are the snippets of table background available when you launch each table. For players just looking to play some pinball these might seem like a bit of an annoyance, but for those who appreciate the history of the industry, or the history of games in general, these blurbs are fascinating and offer insight into the development of pinball games as a whole.\n\nThe visual issues and physics mentioned above are nitpicky issues, but part of what makes them stand out is the price of the overall package. At thirty dollars or more a pop for each "season," or five dollars a piece to buy tables individually, the tables in Pinball Arcade feel like they come at a stomach-churning premium, especially when compared to its competitors. Doubtless the premium is partially due to licensing costs for the various tables from their original producers, but when alternatives like Pinball FX offer cheaper tables with arguably (from a video game perspective) more complex gameplay and higher production values, it can be hard to justify to oneself the pricing here. That said, there's something to be said for featuring "real" tables as opposed to completely unrealistic fantasy models, and when the content of each season is taken into account the price discrepancy isn't as great as it at first seems, since each season consists of 10 or more unique tables, meaning tables average out to about 3 dollars a pop if the basic version of each season is purchased, less for the Season 1 tables since there are 14 of them.\n\nIf you're a pinball aficionado, Pinball Arcade is definitely the game to look at, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates more about game design than just the latest graphics engine and online shooting. The tables play nicely, and the extras make for a unique, well-valued package. If, on the other hand, you're turned off by the idea of solid-state hardware and often incredibly dated table aesthetics, then look elsewhere.","June 18, 2015","true","24.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's technically the grandfather of all modern video games, mechanical pinball was the first arcade game. They've been around longer then any video arcade game. They're an important part of not just gaming culture, but the entertainment industry, right up there with any other fine art. And if you think about it, the amazing effort put into every specific machine is extraordinary. Just imagine putting all those little gears and lights and gizmos together, so someone can slap some flippers around to get a high score.\n\nAnyways, enough about my praise of the pinball machine and onto the review. Farsight has done an excellent job recreating over 40 pinball tables (to date) and releasing them in virtual form. There has been other attempts at true 3d virtual pinball recreations, mostly those PS2 games, but the amount of tables to choose from was small, and the graphics, quite poor. They were poor representations of the tables. Now, why should the casual game be interested in this? Because simply put, the pinball experience is something unique to it. If you have not already tried a pinball table before, a *REAL* one, not something like Pinball FX, then you should defintely download the demo and try out the free table of the week. It's a real treat to see everything about the IRL machine recreated in minute detail. The lights the ramps the targets the animitronics, the dialogue, the dot matrix displays, and the charm of even the older mechanical machines are all recreated virtually.\n\nLike I've said, you've got over 40 tables to choose from, with another 20 tables planned for release in 2014. Let me go over how the game isn't really free to play, but more like an actual paid game. You can buy individual tables for 4.99 each. Some of the tables are surely worth it, you've got legendary classics like Medieval Madness, Terminator 2, and quirky and rare tables like Cactus Canyon, and Going Nuts. You've got tables from all eras, old electro mechanical pins like Genie, and some of the more early released 1980s efforts by Balley like Black Knight and Class of 1812, both of which I highly reccomend, picking them up via the season 1 pack. The season packs cost 29.99 and come with 20 tables each. You're only paying for a few dollars per table, but if you want you can pick up individual tables of the more popular ones like T2 and Medieval Madness for 5 dollars each. I do not reccomend picking up the Pro pack, for 2 extra dollars you get a small change to the ini file and the option to access to the operator menu. Which also invalidates your score.\n\nComparsions to Pinball FX2 can and will be made. Pinball FX is notably cheaper.. you can get Humble Bundle keys which contain 2/3 of the tables for a dollar. But a majority of the tables are Marvel liscenced virtual pins made only for the game. And a lot of them don't have very fun goals. Take a look at Farsights virtual repesentation of Funhouse on Pinball Arcade, which came out in 1990, side by side with Zen Studio's newest lisceneced table from Marvel, Dr. Strange and you'll see the difference. Funhouse is 20 years older and 20 times more fun. This is because the table's featured in Pinball Arcade are much better designed, have more satisfying rewards, and have a snappier pace.\n\nVirtual pinball in itself is a niche, but a niche defintely worth trying out. It's actually quite accessable, unlike most games that are niche - rougelikes for example. I would reccomend anyone with a passing interest to try out the game (Dont think its free to play, its defintely not, but they provide one fully functional table every month.) If you've played a pinball machine in your life, and you enjoyed it, download this game and give it a try.\n","December 22, 2013","true","214.6"," 25 of 48 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","25","48","0","5"

They do an excellent job simulating the sights/sounds that you remembered from these wonderful machines.\nThe physics feel very real, but there will never be quirks that develop as these simulators will never show wear and tear.\n\nI've trial-played most of the tables, and the one I'm very disappointed in is the White Water. This is an excellent game in person (continue to play) with a much nicer tri-color backlight display and the sound effects of this simulation game are atrocious.\n\nOverall though, this has been an excellent and fun experience. I've showed my kids that this is really fun stuff and even cooler in person! (albeit more difficult for sure)\n\nA++ guys; keep the tables coming!

Depends on how you look at them. we could easily be paying for each individual table at a time. as they stand season packs do add another thing and that is a chance to try a table that you never would consider before.

No need for Gimmics or Special FX it's as close as you can get without playing the actual Pinball table. Although come to think of it sometimes it's better because there's no dodgy flipper or bad reflections as many Arcades place the tables (in the UK at least) too close to a window.\n\nThe DX11 version is the Mutts Nutts (or DB if you prefer !) and with season 5 upon us there are now over 40 tables available. Sure there are a few crap one's but with 3 of my all time arcade favourites in Fish Tales, The Getaway High Speed 2 & Funhouse faithfully reproduced I can't really complain.\n\nThe interface is getting a bit clunky now with the number of tables available as you have to scroll through a long list to find the table of your choice. Perhaps a future update will address this with search options or being able to arrange the tables by say season, year or manufacturer as well as a favourites option. When the disc versions of Pinball Arcade\nHall of Fame came out on PS2 & Wii all the tables were represented in an Arcade with so many tables in each room which worked well so something along those lines would be good as well. My only real gripe is the Pro version of the tables which is just a rip off. Why not make them available for free if you achieve all the wizard goals on a table ?.\n\nAbove all it's so much fun to play and although I'm a seasoned player I still get frustrated when a ball drains unexpectedly or I tilt the table just short of my all time high score !. But that's what it's all about realistic gameplay that draws you in to having another go. I'm sure you won't regret buying it but I would wait for a sale before buying the earlier seasons. Who know you may get as good as me with lots of practice but I doubt it ! :).","November 15, 2015","true","186.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I really enjoy playing the actual tables and if you are pulled towards nostalgia then its great. The biggest problem I have is with the ball physics, but even that isn't a simple good or bad. Some of the tables, like Bride of Pinbot, play great. Other tables, like Funhouse and Tales of Arabian Nights, have terrible physics and the ball seems to defy gravity, floating all around the table. I have seen some people trying to argue that all of the tables play great with real physics; can only assume they live on the moon. It is something you get used to, but it does make it hard to track the ball and makes for readjusting when switching back to a better table. I am surprised they made Tales of Arabain Nights the free table as it is a complete turn-off. This tells me the company is in complete denial if they think that table is good and a sales conviner\n. I actually didn't buy the Season packs until I read that some tables have great physics and others, like Tales, are terrible. There are also some issues with camera angles being not always the greatest choices especially if you don't want the camera to jump around and track the ball (I'm not a fan of that). I've noticed some tables, like Theater of Magic, have times where they are choppy for a second or two while most run smoothly all of the time.\nOverall, I recommend this to a pinball fan. I pretty much consider a handfull of the tables (Funhouse and Tales of Arabian Nights for instance) and won't touch them. I'm not sure if they will ever correct the physics for those and I am not sure as to why different tables have better physics than others.\nIf you are new to pinball, I think Pinball FX is much better with consistently smooth physics. After that, if the pinball bug bites,  try Pinball Arcade, but you should check out something other than the free game.","August 16, 2014","false","34.9"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xanija/recommended/238260/","xanija","Xanija","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xanija/","267 products in account","This game is a dream come true for me. I played pinball on real machines when I was a few years younger and since I discovered it first on Android a few months ago, it's easily the game I've spent most time on this year.\n\nWhy is it so good (and what is not so good)?\n\nThese pinball tables are all digital versions of original tables. Farsight spends a lot of effort into realistic physics, ROM emulations, digitalising the artwork etc. You can feel, they are pinball enthusiasts. I might not be an expert for all pinball games on the market. I tested a few, but this was exactly what I was looking for. Most pinball games have features, which are impossible on a real table, especially when you look at Pinball FX2 in comparison. I will come back to FX2 later in this review.\n\nThis game offers table for every kind of pinball fans: Are you looking for some nostalgic pinball experience, you might want to play "Big Shot", "Central Park" or the never released "Goin' Nuts", a table which really drives me nuts. It starts with a 3 ball multiball and shooting at dropdown target increases a timer. Once you only have left one ball, the timer is a countdown. If it reaches zero, your turn is over.\n\nOr do you look for some easy to play tables of the 90's? Try "Scared Stiff", a great Bally Table or "Attack from Mars". If you prefer tables with a deep ruleset, check out "Ripley's believe it or not" or "Twilight Zone"\n\nA word on the Season Table Packs: Currently you can buy Season One and Two in different versions. A standard pack and a pro pack. If you don't plan to use the operator menu of a table and just want to play, as you would play a real table, I recommend to go with the standard pack.\n\nThen you will see there are different prices for Season One and Two. Although Season One is the cheaper pack (at time of writing this review, this might change), it probably has the better tables. At least this seems to be the general consensus. This doesn't mean the tables in Season Two are bad. There are some great highlights in there, like Centaur, Terminator 2, Tee'd off, Whirlwind, Whitewater etc. But in my opinion there are more great tables in Season One. You might want to get both (I have both seasons on Android and will have Season Two on PC as well eventually - I'm hoping for a price drop with start of Season 3) [edit 17.12.2013: The price has dropped indeed with start of Season 3].\n\nThe table "Tales of the Arabian Nights" is completely free to play, without any time or point limits. All other tables need to be purchased.\n\nOk, coming to the issues of Pinball Arcade: First of all, the menus are a pain. Ok for touch screens (not good looking there either, but they fit their purpose). Selecting a table when owning all 41 could be made easier (Farsight, please check out Pinball FX2 for an idea). Also it isn't really good to navigate through the menu with the controller. Improvement is required here, both in presentation and in usability.\n\nSecondly, some tables have bugs. Sometimes the camera doesn't behave as it should. Or table goals are not recognised (For example I had to get 2 x Lost in the Zone before the game decided to give me the Wizard goal for it - although I already had wizard goals active). I have not encountered any gamebreaking issues yet.\n\nPresentation of the game: Clearly said, I like the way the tables are presented in graphics and sound. Although Pinball FX2 looks more polished, for me the Pinball Arcade tables look more realistic. Same is for gameplay. Don't get me wrong, I like Pinball FX2 as well. In the end it's probably more a question of your personal taste.\n\nThanks for reading, I hope it helps you on your decision. I also recommend to watch the videos of Pinballwiz45b in the Community-Hub. Not only he is a fantastic pinball player, you will also get a nice impression of the tables.\n\n[Update 17.12.2013]\nNow that season 3 has come out, the price for season 2 has been lowered, so all seasons are now available the same price.\n\nPlease note the following for season 3:\n\n- It will only contain 10 tables, and by the time of writing this, we don't know all tables it will contain. It's significantly less than season 1 with 21 tables and season 2 with 19 tables.\n\n- Right now there's only the first table out. Usually Farsight releases 1 table pack (which is now just one table, so it's not really a table pack any more) every month.\n\n- Currently they released Fish Tales and they announced to have Whodunnit, Junkyard and Black Knight 2K\n\n- Farsight now also offers a free table of the month, which you can play without restrictions. The first free table of the month is Whirlwind","December 6, 2013","true","579.1"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","2"

Every sound, graphic and animation you remember has been faithfully reproduced.\n\nIn short, it's everything you want a pinball game to be!\n\nNow for the negative; The menu graphics and fonts are large and clunky, and in general not very visually appealing, and changing graphic settings can only be done outside of the game, but both of these aspects can be largely ignored.\n\nThe main downfall of this game is however, is pricing. While, for a pinball game, it hits all of the right sweet spots, to be able to play more than just one table, you need to spend a heck of a lot.\n\nTo buy Season One (to essentially convert your "Demo" into a full game), it costs almost twice the price of Skyrim!

Most of these landmark arcade tables are professionally well recreated with a staggering attention to detail in glorious 1080p. Yes, many complained that you have to pay for additional tables - and pro packs might be costly for what they really give. Multiplayer ( tournaments ) and DirectX11 features also not available at the release, only later in 2014.  Otherwise gameplay remains rock solid, fluid, physics quite decent,  though as any video pinball  we might sometimes feel gravity/ball weight not as severe as real tables ( thus developers targeting a wider community ). At the same time, experts still need to work hard in order to level up in the leaderboards and completing some challenging 'wizard goals'.\n\nPros:  package of authentic and licensed tables; a blast to play; beautiful and detailed graphics; wide array of goals to achieve.\n\nCons ( minor ) : gravity/ball physics not always as realistic as purists would have liked; no tournaments several weeks after release.","December 22, 2013","true","62.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I bought that table and played it and it's just as I remember playing it when I was in high school -- with the exception of some of the audio is missing because it's "too suggestive" (which is stupid because the whole game is about double entendre).  Big fan.  As for the other tables, the most I can tell you is you'll have to play the demos and see if you like them or not.

From it's fluid and realistic ball physics to the attention to details given to the large selection of tables available, it's easy to see why this latest Farsight release as been so highly praised. A collection of some of pinball's most famous tables are at your fingertips, and you're spoilt for choice with legendary tables such as Star Trek The Next Generation, Black Hole, Terminator 2, Bride of Pin-Bot and Theatre of Magic to name just a few. Plus there's the added bonus of the fact that you can experience the Tales of the Arabian Nights table absolutely free of charge.\n\nYes there are other pinball games available, but no other features tables based on their actual real life counterpart and none even come close to being able to match how it plays a game of Pinball.

The tables are pretty spendy, but it is probably justified by licensing costs. The engine itself is pretty good, but the ball moves faster and feels lighter than it would on an actual pinball table, even immaculate condition machines, which I have played a few. This is only a minor annoyance and the pitch perfect tables are worth the price of admission. The first season is far and away the best deal and has most of the tables you would want anyways.\n\nThe package is far from perfect however. The UI is awful and little has been done to update it for this platform which really hurts the overall package. The lack of integration with Steam is a missed opportunity considering competing for a high score is a big draw to pinball.\n\nIf you love playing actual pinball, this game is for you.\n\nIf nostalgia isn't part of the package for you, you may be better served with Pinball FX2 which boasts friendslist integration so you can easily see how your friends did on each table and try to beat their top score (which is the reason FX2 is getting more play time from me these days).","December 10, 2014","true","77.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is as close as you are going to get to perfect pinball on a PC outside a cabinet based sim, and then I'd probably recommend still using this software. I've been able to scratch my pinball itch with all these tables. I've purchased two seasons worth of tables for no small amount of money. I've spent more cash on this game than any other for the last several years. The physics are spot on and most of your typical pinball strategies are applicable. Many of the tables virtualized in this game are quite rare and hard to get to play. Some are great playing and not very popular in the arcades (aka Black Rose). While there is no real substitute for a real table, this is pretty good way to relive some of your favorite tables. Black Rose, Medieval Madness, Star Trek, Bride of Pinbot, and Adams Family are just a few of the ones I recommend you try out.

If I were to break this review down in scores of 1 to 10, I would give each of the following these scores:\n\nPresentation: 8/10 - A wide range of tables, producers, styles, and time frames of pinball, from the basic bell & whistle games to the more recent electronic gems like Addams Family. My down marks for this is that the PC version does not include the history of pinball videos that the Android version does, which to me greatly enhances the package, or lack thereof.\n\nGraphics: 8/10 - Since Farsight got the licenses for these tables, their dedication to accuracy shows. Some pieces are missing, (Christopher Lloyd - Addams Family), due to contractual agreements, but wherever possible, FS has stuck as close to the original design of the table as they can. There was recently an update to DirectX 11, and if you have the system to run it, the graphical improvement is definitely noticeable.\n\nGameplay: 7.5/10 - Gameplay only suffers IMO due to an over adbundance of the need to "nudge" or shake a table, and if you are someone like myself who doesn't use this 'ability', the tables seem to penalize you by the ball consistently draining on side lanes, taking odd tracks, and a general REPEAT of the same ball play even in multiple player games. Also, as Steam Achievements are included in PA, once you have obtained a few decent scores on a game, it seems as the difficulty is somehow magically increased, thus making further achievements difficult if not almost impossible (Addams Family Super Bear Bonus for example). Aside from this each table has its on nuances and tricks, from Terminator 2, to Haunted House.\n\nVariety: 8.5/10 - It is here where PA shines as they have tables from the major players in the profession, Bally, Williams, Gotlieb, wide-body tables, multi-level tables, and of course, the most popular pinball table in history, Addams Family.\n\nPrice: 6/10 - As has been mentioned in other reviews, the pricing model for PA is IMO its biggest weakness. Tales of Arabian Nights comes as a free table, but the other tables all have to be purchased, either seperately, or through Season packs. I have all of the tables except for a couple from Season 3, all but 3 from Season 4, and none from Season 5 yet, and had these season packs gone on sale at an earlier date, I could have saved about 20 - 30% of my total cost in the game. Also, even though PA is cross-platform (Steam, IOS, Android, console, PC), purchases on one platform do not carry over to the others. So if you want for example the Addams Family on both your tablet and your PC, you would be paying for 2 copies. The before mentioned missing history videos are a part of this as well.\n\n\nIn conclustion, Pinball Arcade is a great recreation and a good way to travel back to the time when smokey rooms, stale coke, and the sounds of pinball machines filled the air. It is not perfect, but then what is?","August 15, 2015","true","370.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Sometimes the ball will stutter or move erratically.  Sometimes the ball will move suddenly through a gate.  There are certain bugs that are unique to some table.\n\nOverall, if you are a fan of pinball, you have to purchase this game.  I would recommend sticking with the standard versions and avoiding the pro versions, and using that money that you saved to buy all of the seasons.","April 2","true","53.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The Web and Timeshock, which came out in 1995 and 1997 respectively, actually felt like a real table.\n\nUgly menu that's up in your face all the time. Want to play a two player game? You can't just hit "Start" twice like you would on the real game. Instead you have to go into the menu, set players to two and then start the game.\nThis setting isn't even remembered between games. If you want to start another multiplayer game after both players drain their last ball, you have to go into the menu again.\n\nFor some reason I can't enter my initials with a gamepad, even though it works during gameplay.

Its my favorite pinball machine by far.  Imagine my delight when I found out that it could be purchased and played legally.  My elation was short lived when I saw the prices for the Pinball Arcade tables.  Even though the table packs would have to drop 75-90% for me to even consider purchasing them I figured I could just pick up Twilight Zone for a fiver and be done with it.  Fortunately for me I tried the TZ table before purchasing.  It is not the same game that I am familiar with.  The visuals are pretty close but the sounds are way off.  And these inaccuracies are present on other licensed property tables.  If I am going to pay out the nose I expect a product as advertised.\n\nNormally I would wait for a Steam sale and pick it up on the cheap but it appears these DLC packs never go on sale.  Maybe they will lower the price once the developers squeeze out the die-hard pinball wizards.  In the end the issues that surround Pinball Arcade make it a no-brainer uninstall.","December 26, 2013","false","0.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","2"

Icing on the cake.  Sadly however, icing is all this really is.  I was underwhelmed by the ball physics, which felt rather ping-pong ball light, and the flipper action lacked weight.  Worse still - the inability to intuitively set the view to a simple overhead that doesn't require any screen flipping was a complete deal killer for me.  It's possible I suppose, that the ability to put the view the way I want it does exist - and if someone would like to point it out to me, I'll give this another fair shot.  But for now? It was uninstalled very quickly indeed and I've no plans to return to it.\n\nWith that said - pinball still kicks ♥♥♥. So what to do?  I have one word for you : timeshock!   The ProPinball series of original pinball tables is the absolute gold standard for computer-based pinball as far as I'm concerned, and that opinion hasn't changed in over a decade.  Head over to Greenlight and check out the HD editions they're currently trying to put to the light of day.  If you love pinball - these guys deserve your support unreservedly.\n\nOther alternatives - the Pinball FX2 on Steam is in most cases, acceptable and entertaining, though not exceptional. If you absolutely have to have your real-world modeled pinball?  Google PinMAME and do a little research.  It's more work to set up, but it'll get you the real-world tables you crave.\n\n","November 30, 2013","false","0.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The other 50 tables that came downloaded can only be played until you hit a high score and then you're kicked out, although you're allowed to replay them as many times as you want.\n\nIf you're downloading this looking for a free game to waste a couple of hours on, then it shouldn't matter since you can still have fun flailing the tables around with the tilting feature, and if you end up losing all your balls before you hit a high score then the limits won't be a real issue for you.\n\nThe problem is that after a while you just get tired of the game, there's no way for you to move on or unlock any more tables freely. Taking out highscores leaves you with really no point to replay a table or try to improve. Instead you feel punished for improving. It's like minigolf, the worse you are, the longer you get to play it. The better you are at getting points, the faster you'll be kicked out off the tables.\nI wish the free version of the game would give you more. I'd love it if you could unlock one more free table by completing achievements, or even just being able to choose backround music to replace the silence/crappy music of some pinball tables.\n\nWhen you go to buy a table, it just feels unneedlessly complicated to give three options of buying, but none of them let you just buy the single table you want! Your choices are to buy the 30$ season pack, a 5$ pack for 2 tables, and then ussually a 8$ "Pro" pack version that never has it's differences explained ingame.\nYou're out of luck if you just want a single table in the pack, and the second table included is one that you couldn't care less about. There's not much flexibility with your choices or any real alternatives to that, and it just doesn't feel like a value if part of the price you're paying is for a table you'll never use.\n","December 22, 2013","false","2.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

And for almost as long as there have been video games, there have been video games attempting to bring the pinball experience into a video game.\n\nFor my entire life, I've played pinball, and tried pinball video games. None of them came close - they could not adequately imitate the freedom of a steel ball rolling freely across a painted wooden table, hitting things, and bouncing back out. They made games that looked like pinball, but didn't feel like Pinball. Even the Pinball FX series, as good as it is, still doesn't feel like a real ball spinning across a table freely.\n\nPinball Arcade is the first game I've ever felt came as close as possible to what pinball is. And they do this not by imitating pinball, but by digitizing pinball - by taking real pinball tables, and scanning them - not just taking pictures of the machines, but by taking them apart and scanning each and every part fully and completely - not just how the parts look, but how they weigh, feel, and act. As a result, they end up doing what other pinball games never have - they make the game feel very, very close to playing the same pinball table as you would find in an arcade. The tables offered are recreations of the same tables, and for all but a minor detail, they feel the same.\n\nI have a hard time believing that any video game pinball can get the same tactile feel that true pinball tables have, and this is the one aspect that Pinball Arcade doesn't adequately duplicate. But they're closer than any other video game pinball has ever been - as close as I believe is possible. But if it's possible to take that last step, and get the same tactile sensation of having the ball roll across the table and feel the faint vibrations in your hands... I think that the team at Farsight Studios are the people who can make it happen.\n\nThe only downside that Pinball Arcade has right now is that their core UI for selecting tables is based on a touch-screen or controller system, and doesn't work cleanly with a computer's mouse-based interface, and almost doesn't work at all by keyboard. This is supposedly being updated and revamped soon, though, so I don't really mark them down too hard on this. The gameplay - when you're actually playing the pinball machine - is still very well-done.\n\nIf you like real-life pinball, this is the game you want to play.","October 2, 2014","true","34.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

In this age of bleep blop beloop 8-bit graphics there sat in the corner the legacy of the last great gaming icons. The pinball machines. Like dinosaur bones they just looked really cool but no one would really play those when you had sitdown SpyHunter or Tron Discs to drop tokens on.\nYet I was attracted to these machines, whose art and design were always such a pleasure to see. And when games started rising to 2 tokens per play, the pinball machines stayed at one. So i started playing them, Black Knight, Fun House, Adams Family, etc.... and I gained an appreciation for the ancestor to my hobby.\n\nNow all the arcades are dead. Im an old guy with a job i work too hard at. So when I found out about this recreation of the machines that were so cool to me back in the day, I immediately loved it. These painstakingly recreated pinball machines pull me right back into that mall arcade in 1986.\n\nIf youre a retro gamer, if you like pinball...you will appreciate this game.\n\n8 out of 10.","December 7, 2014","true","63.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Reynolds/recommended/238260/","Brian_Reynolds","Brian Reynolds","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Reynolds/","620 products in account","Quick review to start: Holy cow is this ever fun to play!  The only caveat to recommending the Pinball Arcade is that, naturally, it's all about pinball and maybe that doesn't float your boat.  I do believe that pinball is universally entertaining however if you accept the inherent gameplay mechanics and so if you play this game you'll find happiness.\n\nThis is the second major pinball system on Steam now, but I will rate it unquestionably the best.  Why?  Because it *feels* perfect.  All the physics involved has a very satisfying sense of weight to it... the ball accelerates believably, the timing of when you strike the ball with your flippers affects the trajectory properly, and the rebounds from bumpers and sidewalls fits your expectations just *right*.  This is absolutely the best playing pinball experience you'll find on Steam.  There IS still room for improvement however but those are fiddly details that you'll hardly notice (the ball never leaves the table surface making certain actions reliably consistent compared with reality, the flippers are rock-solid and don't have any "spongeyness" that happens with real tables, and the friction of the table surface and steel rails is constant which again makes the ball behavior suffer no random deviations).\n\nI've been familiar with pinball games, but I'm not a nut for the genre, and so I'm not bothered by the lack of absolute authenticity with the real tables.  Each game that's recreated here scores high by replicating a faithful experience.  You probably won't be able to "train" on these virtual recreations and expect perfect knowledge about how to work the real thing, but you WILL get all the entertainment that was built into the original games.  And on the note about those original games.... WOW!  The variety of tables to play is astonishing from truly old school pinball experiences from the 1960's to classic 70's and 80's table complete with early arcade sounds (I *love* those sounds!) to the zenith of pinball evolution in the mid 1990's.  The Pinball Arcade is truly a museum piece approach to the genre that shows no favorites for any one time period or manufacturer.  The breadth of choice is very, very nice!\n\nSome other things to note: all the tables present in this game are recreations of the originals which were designed to eat your money.  This is important to remember because even though there's no longer any quarters being spent to play there can be a lot of frustrating moments where your game ends prematurely because happenstance physics will cause your ball to drain no matter how skillful you can play.  It's possible to "nudge" the machine in multiple directions in an attempt to coax the ball into a different trajectory but I can't count how many times I've had terrible games because the ball just dumps itself down the drain prematurely.  Another important thing is that the game is going to be receiving a visual upgrade in 2014 when the developers release a DirectX 11 patch that adds much more modern lighting support and (hopefully!) texture map resolution bumps.  The game looks great already but these two additions will make the experience even more lifelike and exciting.\n\nI do have some gripes to make about the game however.  Currently there's no support for Steam Friends in game, which is something that Zen Studio's "Pinball FX 2" supports and I miss it.  You are encouraged to make a FarSight Studios account in order to have your scores ranked against other people, but there's something mighty satisfying about seeing your scores compared with people you actually know on Steam, and that's just not present right now.  Another complaint is that the Steam release still shows heavy connections to the Pinball Arcade releases on lower performance hardware (tablets, iphone, Android, etc.).  The game still PLAYS fantastic, but there's a level of spit and polish to the user interface and camera controls that's just not right for a PC game and cheapens the experience.\n\nThe last thing I have to say about the base Pinball Arcade experience concerns the Free-to-Play nature of the title.  "Free-to-Play"... eh.... it is and it isn't.  When you download the game from Steam you will be downloading ALL the tables which you can play as long as you want UP UNTIL THE FIRST HIGH SCORE.  This is actually rather generous because it means there's no time's-up-and-you're-locked-out-until-you-buy penalty, and in practice I found that the minimum high score threshold is high enough for you to play for a good amount of time in a single game and it's only when you really start getting your skill up that you find yourself hitting that ceiling.  Once you do starting bumping up to that limit you'll likely have found some favorite tables to play and you can then purchase them individually or all at once via the Season Packs.  There's even one pinball machine you can play forever (Tales of the Arabian Nights) that is extremely fun and definitely not a "throwaway bone" for the FTP monicker.\n\nFor all that this offers for free I say check it out right away and see if it finds a place in your heart... there's a lot to love here and I daresay if you're not a pinball fan when you start playing you will be when you're finished.","November 29, 2013","true","89.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Granted, if you're not into pinball, there's nothing really here for you, but without spending any money you do get full access to one table and can demo every other table without paying a dime.\n\nPROS: Very good (though not perfect) physics, table designs are nearly spot-on to the real machines, includes a mix of various tables from the most popular to the least popular, as well as from the most common to the absurdly rare, actual ROM data is being used so the tables have all of their hidden features and everything, all of which are documented in-game, extensive instructions available for every table to make learning the rulesets much easier.\n\nCONS: Default configuration and camera settings are garbage for anyone looking to REALLY play the game, so you need to reconfigure everything, the "Call Attendant" feature for dealing with issues can't handle most of the problems which crop up (which are thankfully few and far between), very expensive if you want "pro" access to all the tables (extra configuration settings and options for examining the table)... still cheaper than owning just a single REAL machine. :P","June 8, 2014","true","564.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

If you've ever played any of the tables featured, definitely check it out.\n\nI've also come to appreciate the game as kind of a historical museum. I'm not really a pinball afficianado, but I do like browsing through the tables and seeing how trends came and went over the decades. The transition from electromechanical to solid state, the way targets gave way to ramps, the fascination with multiple playfields and flippers that slowly died out, etc. I dunno, it's interesting.\n\nIf I had to criticize the game, I'm not a fan of how most tables come in packs of two. I bought Cactus Canyon and found myself saddled with Central Park. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the charms of an electromechanical table, but I'd really prefer something more traditional, like Big Shot. But if I bought Big Shot I'd also get Scared Stiff, which I didn't care too much for, and yeah, you see where this is going.\n\nI'm not knowledgable enough to discuss the physics and how accurate they are. It SEEMS like the ball should be going faster than it is. Compare any gameplay video of a table in Pinball Arcade to a video of its real-life counterpart and you can definitely see a difference. Maybe it's just a matter of perspective. Most videos of real pinball games are shot either from the side or from straight up, and it's been far too long since I've been to an arcade to remember if it feels any different.","November 29, 2013","true","131.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I wouldn't say "Arabian Nights" plays precisely like the arcade- the slope of the table seems a little steep- but on the positive side, I've seen very few real-world versions of the table where every moving part worked as well and smoothly as it should, so that's definitely a plus.\n\nThe death of this for me is disk space. 11.3 GB for the one free table I play once in a blue moon. Pinball is like solitaire for me- something I pick up when I want a quick, ten minute game fix, not a three-hour session. I would be far more likely to consider buying more content if the game didn't seem to store every bloody table on my hard drive under the premise that I *might* want to buy them and they should be instantly available the moment I did. As 'tis, I let this go to free up the hard disk space.\n\nSome reviewers have commented that this seems like a port from one of the mobile versions, but I'm going to hazard a guess that the mobile versions don't try to store every possible sale item on your tablet.\n\nBad call on that decision, Farsight.

I highly recommend Pinball Arcade for those "purists" who don't love having a bunch of cartoon characters dancing around the table as you play.\n\nThe physics are entertaining but not as accurate as some rabid fans might suggest and I truly hope Farsight further tweaks them.  Occasionally the game will get weird with "helium ball" or super slowdown where everything including sound & music runs and stays at around 1/4 speed.  These things will right themselves after restarting Steam.\n\nAnother issue on my laptop, which has Intel integrated + Nvidia dedicated graphics, is that Pinball Arcade's configuration utility only recognizes the integrated graphics.  Performance is still fine, but the flipper has about a 1/5 second input lag (really bad for pinball) which can be somewhat alleviated by turning off v-sync.  Hello screen tearing!  On my desktop PC that only has dedicated Nvidia graphics, there is no problem.\n\nHopefully the promised upgrades (already in use on PS4 and Xbone) will be added to Pinball Arcade soon.","December 14, 2014","true","29.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you are a legitimate pinball enthusiast, this game is well worth purchasing.\n\nThough table packs are rather pricey, the amount of fun and satisfaction you can get out of one (Especially the first two seasons) are well worth it. Unlike Pinball FX 2 it's major competitor, tables in Pinball Arcade are LEGITIMATE real life tables that you know, love, loathe and remember.\n\nClassics like FunHouse, Creature from the Black Lagoon, Star Trek TNG and Terminator 2 are all masterfully restored with realistic physics, all the legitimate features, bells and whistles of the original table. Marvellously simulated, these classic tables come with custom ball capability (Whether for visibility or just for shiggles), multiplayer options and a plethora of views to suit your taste.\n\nThe goals are realistically achievable and if you fancy yourself a wizard you can post your scores online to try to out-flip the rest of the cyberverse.\n\nLots of pros, with the 2 cons being A) price as the content rarely goes on sale and B) the lack of cross-platform account sync. (IE Though I have Season 2 Table Pack unlocked on my PC, I can't play those tables on my Android.)\n\nIs this something you typical demanding ADD gamer case will want to splurge on? Probably not. But if you're a pinball enthusiast who has a hard time finding a place with solid tables to play or even who wants to practice for the real deal, you need to have Pinball Arcade (And ideally, seasons one or two table packs, if not both.)","December 19, 2014","true","22.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Leading the charge for commercial video pinball sim, Pinball Arcade seeks to emulate authentic tables as closely as possible.\n\nA digital platform, the base package includes (depending on version) either 1 or 4 real life tables of historical note. New tables are added in packs of 2 as they’re recreated. Farsight has done a good job of mixing older tables with new; simple but groundbreaking boards such as Black Hole are represented along with relatively modern bombastic crowd pleasers such as Medieval Madness.\n\nA strong aspect of the package is well-explained rule sheets with visual aids. If you thought pinball was sheer randomness, and never knew most tables have an intricate sequence of modes to activate for huge jackpots, Farsight’s respect for the game is contagious.\n\nThe only downside is a fundamentals-first ethic, leaving the presentation with the look of a cheap iOS game even in the console versions. Farsight intends to update the front end, but it’s a drag compared to the virtual arcade hangouts in the developer’s earlier generation Pinball Hall of Fame collections. Still, the play is what matters here. When at the table it’s the next best thing to owning a real machine.","September 22, 2014","true","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I mean, really, you got the next gen graphics of a SEGA Dreamcast, all puckered up in the nice package of a Nalgene Hiker's Cantene. (Made in the US of A version, of course.) Now look hun, you may be saying right now, Patroklos, what does a Tabuu designed wallet from Six Flags have to do with the greatest 3rd Person Shooter in Bumble Bee Blast's history? Well I'll tell yah. Personally, I preffered the original Sonic the Hedgehog over Generations or Ep. 4, but in the end, you know, they all dah same. Now look here, tight skirtz on alligators may be rockin' thecaboose, but the only viable class in this game is the SMG genre. Trying to pull some S4 plays with CQC tactics just ain't gonna work no more. You'll get smoked, yah damned grease monkey.

I am very tempted to get a cheap TV and an old laptop and mount the TV on legs for a dedicated portrait video pinball "cabinet".

Non of the competing pinball games of the recent years even come close to the overall presentation and feeling of Pinball arcade.\n\nEvery table in this game is an extremely detailed digital replica of a realworld table. Everything is faithfully simulated, every light, sound and even the backboards. Nice touch: Every table comes with a little bit of trivia, where you can learn about it's original creators and history.\n\nThe pinball machines are sold separately or in season packs. Buying a season pass saves you a good amount of money over buying the tables separately. The amount and variety of tables in every season is spot on. OK, some tables are not my cup of tea, but the majority is very interesting and I love playing them.\n\nThere is just one little thing that I don't like about this game: The developers want extra cash for a so called "pro" version of their tables. The difference is that you are able to access the operators menu that every table has, where you are able to change the amount of balls or at what score you get an extra ball. It seems a bit greedy to me, that I would have to pay extra for something like that.\n\nFor an arcade freak like me this game is just great and highly recommended.\nMy verdict: 9/10 - Great game.","February 9, 2014","true","63.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

As a 20 year veteren as a Arcade/Pinball technician, I love that FarSight is making real world tables to bring back the memories from when Pinball Arcades were in their hayday.\n\nFarSight is getting very comfortable in this niche and each table brings more nostalgia and excitement with each release.\n\nThe one thing that keeps me from liking Zen Studios tables more is that there nudging is not as fluent and realistic as it is in The Pinball Arcade. You get like 2 nudges per 15 seconds and then instant tilt no matter what.  Also, straight down the middle shot in Pinball FX 2 can not be diverted like you can in FarSights Pinball Arcade.   I enjoy PA tables so much that when they start supporting Xbox One (which they stated they will), I'll buy the tables all over again.\n\nHere's to more happy pinballing in the future.

Hoping someday that we'll see extra features like customizable light upgrades and swappable parts for each table, along with multiple monitor support, and DMD options but that's just a specific wish of mine, the game is great right now and it's definitely worth picking up if not only to support the creation of future content from Farsight.","July 28, 2015","true","39.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I couldn't quite believe it was the same game, all of the tables look so much better, especially Black Hole, Attack From Mars, and Circus Voltaire. You can even adjust the room lighting (to around 20%) so as to give the feeling of a real arcade, and adjust the lamp brightness accordingly (55% or lower seems good). When playing with the nVidia 3D surround turned on (press Ctrl T to disable/enable it), there is still a little issue with the light from some of the brighter bulbs appearing to be rendered at a slightly incorrect perspective, i.e. "floating" above the table. I'll try to bring this bug to Farsight's attention, to see if they can get it fixed, but in the meantime just lowering the bulb brightness slightly to around 45% when playing in 3D surround mode with DX11 seems to be sufficient.  Note: the room and bulb settings are under each table's options menu, they're not set from the game's launcher. At the moment, to get into fullscreen mode, you can either select it from the DX11 settings in the game's configuration launcher, or press the Alt-Enter key combination while running the game itself. At the moment, when running with DX11, the game only makes use of the center monitor in nVidia 3D surround mode (whereas when running in DX9 mode it uses all three monitors), so it feels slightly less immersive. It'd be nice to get full 5760x1080 resolution working in landscape mode like it does in DX9 mode. But overall, the DX11 support is such a huge improvement that I feel it already brings this game up to "must-have" status among all games on the PC platform. Awesome job, Farsight!","May 25, 2015","true","82.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The games look great and sound great. The issue is that the physics are not 1:1 to a real Pinball machine. So the Pinball's feel "videogamey". So things like bumbs and other trick shots can be difficult to pull off. But if you want something that is close to what one of these machines plays like, there is not another platform that has all these offical classic pinball machines.  Also the games are sold in packs or solo. The best deal is to get season 1-2 when they go on sale, since those seasons have all the big name pins from the 60's to the 90's. Overall the best way to play pinball without dropping 5k on a used machine or driving miles away to play a single pinball machine.","April 16","true","29.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I've enjoyed the tables themselves but overall, nothing is so impressive that it feels like a fair value. You pay for a season because its stupid to buy individual tables but then you end up with a few table that are fun and you wanted, and a buch that are kind of crap. The menus and UI are complete junk. Clunky, ugly, annoying. Exactly the same as it was in the console game "william's pinball arcade" that came out years ago. Same music and sound FX too! Maybe thats why im turned off by the prices. I paid $10 for that disc and it had so many tables. All you had to do was unlock them by playing. I get it, they have to pay fees, whatever, if they made it more worthwhile to pay $30+ per season I wouldn't care.

We had three TOM's in my hometown (Athens GA) and at least two always had broken Trunks, which if you know TOM then you know a broken Trunk makes the game unplayable.\n\nIt took a second to get used to using the triggers on my controller, but once I did it was almost just-like the real thing.\n\nThe game, all together, is a little pricey but there's plenty of value for the money.","July 15, 2014","true","47.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In Pinball FX2 every table is new and the creators often chose to do things that work in a computer game but could never fly in an actual physical machine. The design here has a different feel. When the ball bounces off a bumper it seems more real and not like a digital object with a metallic texture.\n\nIf the tables were priced a little lower I'd snap a bunch up. Eventually I'll probably get one of the packs of tables, but the cost is a bit more than I would spend in an impulse buy, which is how I make most of my Steam purchases.

At first, I didn't care much for the old school approach. It isn't REALLY accurate. If it were, I could smack and kick the table.....and lose ridiculous amounts of quarters just to get my name on the top score. (I don;'t think that will be happening on this.)\nI've found a few tables I played back in the day. That's what won me over....nostalgia.\nHaving said that, Pinball FX2 is modern and faster and fits the times. This one is NOT real pinball. It's a simulation of real pinball. There are things in REAL pinball that you can do with hand /eye/body cooridantion that you can't do here.\nWhat do I mean by body? When paying real pinball,you can move, angle , shake the table, nudge lightly or hard. That's impossible to duplicate . So, to me, having been a real arcade-troll who actually played Elvira's table, and the Black Hole table, anyone who says this is real ...hasn't played real pinball.\nWhy do I like PinballFX2 better? It could be nothing more than the modern feel and the graphics. The gameplay is fairly similar....although Pinball Arcade doesn't alllow for a small space between lower flippers, which is accurate, FX2 makes up for it in speed and the need to be extremely accurate . It also employs video game animations and character models.\n\nDoes that mean I don't like this game? Nah. It's fine I just think the argument that it's REAL and FX2 isn't is absurd.\n\nThe other thing is, Pinball FX offers up better graphics out of the box....no need to have any special video card bs....or knowledge of how to change your video settings so you can play. THAT'S effed up.  They need to fix that and lower the prices. They want you to think they've done something special. They didn't even design the tables if you think about it. So....why pay more? I don't know. Seems like nothing more than el;itism and greed to me.","June 24, 2014","true","55.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I keep getting sent to support page support@farsightstudios.com That page DOES NOT WORK! Be warned.","April 29","true","78.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

I will edit the review if and when I buy and play more tables.\n\nThe pinball physics engine is really good for the most part. There are some noticeable ball speed issues where they seem to move at unrealistically fast speeds in comparison to real-life pinball machines. Depending on the table, there are some major differences between the quality of the textures and sounds, but it's usually acceptable. The worst textures are of the flooring and walls, but those can't really be considered as being parts of the tables. It would be nice if the developers actually made an effort to polish every facet of the game though, since the flooring and walls are also part of the gaming experience. At the time of this writing we are waiting on an apparently big DirectX 11 patch, but there's no telling if the overall look and presentation will actually be improved or if more negative aspects will be erroneously added because of the update. Let's hope it's a positive change.\n\nSome tables seem to be plagued by various bugs. I'm not sure if these bugs are also present in the real-life machines, but in Ripley's Believe It or Not, there are some game breaking bugs. Balls will get stuck and the game engine doesn't recognize some key moments, and these bugs will make you stuck. The only way to fix it is to quit the game and go back. I've contacted support about these bugs and they said that they are aware of these bugs and are working on fixes at the time of this writing.\n\nAll four tables I played seem to be emulated well, despite the issues I've mentioned earlier. What's great about Pinball Arcade is that all tables available are based on actual real-life machines. You won't find any digital pinball related gimmicks or gameplay mechanics. This game is almost like an unlimited, interactive museum of these classic gaming machines where physics, reflexes, and skills are all that matter. On the other hand, in addition to the lack of overall polish and some bugs, my other complaint is about their pricing model. I understand some people may feel that $30 per pack is reasonable, but I feel that it's a mistake. If the prices were lower and if there were good sales, I'm sure they would sell much more on Steam. It also seems like the Steam/PC platform is not their priority, as they appear to be spending much more time with other platforms. Overall, if you have an interest in playing real-life pinball machines on your PC, this is probably one of the best options available, and new tables are supposed to be added on a monthly basis.\n\nPinball Arcade is good.","January 29, 2015","true","52.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The same thing goes for the 'other' pinball games.\nThe pricing is not where the fault lies.  It's the actual gameplay that I didn't like.

It is nothing short of a work of art and nostalgia plays a big part. There really is something about playing on tables you have actually played in reality. Personally though I can take art or leave it. And in comparison with FX2 as a COMPUTER GAME Pinball Arcade is not going to please such a wide audience. The difference between the two is comparable to a top level flight sim and a  very good, playable, air-combat game. It depends exactly what you want. Some have complained about the price of the table packs and that it is listed as "free". I disagree - there is a lot here for your money IF real tables are what you are after and the fact that you can try them all for free makes its claims perfectly valid. 89%","November 22, 2013","true","0.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

I started playing to learn the tables at my local tavern and have become so much better.  Only bad thing is you dont realize how many quarters your throwing at home.......when i get to the tavern it's shocking.  For me, 1/4 games are great.....maybe i just need more practice.  Completing a table for free vs. 20$ at the tavern is a mega plus!  As a side, pinball fx2 is fantastic too, but very different.  This is realistic pinball, whereas fx2 throws in alot of animation and such.

The new DX11 version of the game looks much better. Pinball is a lightshow - and now this feels like it too. Fingers crossed for better textures and higher poly models.\n\nAlso, I do hope they improve physics with even better ball on flipper interactions. They are so close to nailing the feel. All the real flipper tricks should be possible in game. Ball should hit the glass at times - like they do in Pro Pinball. Not sure if the ball jumps at all in pinball arcade?

It's not free to play. It's a demo. The game has fairly good reproductions of a decent number of tables and if they were free to play on, things would be great... but they are not. I am told there's a new free table every month.... never found one. There's only one table I can find that you can play for free.\n\nThe rest of the tables have a score limit applied to them. exceed this score...and that's it, the game wants you to buy a table pack to continue. This would be ok if the score limit was set to a reasonably high level... but in every case, it's set so low that you don't even get a chance to determine whether the table would actually be one you'd be prepared to pay for. It takes almost as long to navigate the clonky menu system than the game itself will run for.\n\nEssentially, think of this as a film. You're sat in the cinema, you're munching popcorn, there's been a few trailers, the lights dim, the words "filmed in Panavision" appear on screen.... and then the film stops, the lights come up and someone immediately tries to sell you the film on blu-ray based on what you've seen so far... in the form of a box-set, bundled with some other films you've not had a chance to check out properly. These boxsets, they're not cheap either.

There's just no replacing the feel of a real pinball flying around a table with real targets, bumpers, and ramps, imperfections and all.\n\nOnce you get over that expectation, though, if you have any appreciation for classic pinball at all, you need to pick this up.  It's clear the developers have a deep appreciation for pinball, from the table effects to the challenges and detailed instructions so you can finally see just how each bonus worked on those tables you could never figure out.  Just because it can't be perfect doesn't mean it's not an outright fun nostalgia trip that's cheaper than actually buying and maintaining real pinball tables.","June 19, 2014","true","64.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Not great, but good. Sadly, they chose to use the same user interface, which I think isn't very good. Particularly not on a big computer screen. While the graphics are vibrant, there's something odd about the zooming/scaling causing jagged edges. I saw this on Android too. Anti-aliasing might help a bit, but still. Lastly, I wish they sold the tables as DLCs through Steam instead of in-game.\n\nAnyway, this is the only proper pinball game on Steam at the moment. If you like pinball, you can't do much better.\n\nI'd recommend checking out Pro Pinball too though, which have gotten a bit old, but are still very very good. They are also remaking them eventually.","November 5, 2013","true","5.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It's absolutely ridiculous. On top of it all, these "exact recreations" of real-life pinball tables (the entire gimmick of this game) are complete let-downs. These tables seem barely realistic at all and the physics and responsiveness are very wonky as well.\n\nAll in all, it screams ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port job (of a game that was already kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥), and it is a shining example of the free-to-play business model being used shamefully terribly.\n\nThere are other, better pinball video games out there which, despite not meant to be recreations of real-life licensed tables, nail the feel of pinball better and with night-and-day difference of video game development craft and quality. Go play Zen Pinball or Pokemon Pinball or Sonic Spinball or Metroid Prime Pinball or 3D Pinball for Windows: Space Cadet... Those are all much better pinball games than this. Pinball FX2 and Dream Pinball 3D are some other ones that are actually on Steam as well, and, although I have never played those, odds are that they are much better than The Pinball Arcade here. It honestly wouldn't be that hard a feat to accomplish. This game is an insult.\n\nIf you want more details and the specifics for how and why The Pinball Arcade sucks and is garbage, this is a pretty spot-on review from another fellow on Steam:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/stavrosthewonderchicken/recommended/238260/","July 13, 2014","false","2.2"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

I am not a hardcore pinball player, neither am I a casual one. I am somewhere in the middle.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, I own all the Season 1 tables. I also own all the tables by Zen Studious, a rival pinball company from FarSight.\n\nTo be honest, I enjoy playing pinball from Zen Studious than from FarSight on the PC. The reason being, the tables I played from FarSight just does not feel right. Mind you, in real life, I have never played these tables from FarSight on a table board before. The controls just does not seem to feel right.\n\nHowever for all the Pinball enthusiasts out there, I would recommend this to them as well. There is no doubt that it was fun playing these tables from FarSight. For the casual players, I would recommend them to try the tables from Zen Studious.\n\nSo I would give this game a hesitant recommendation. If there is a button that says "Neutral" on this review, I would most definitely click that.","September 1, 2014","true","38.8"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfbeast71/recommended/238260/","wolfbeast71","Wolfbeast","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfbeast71/","149 products in account","The problem with this game is the way it's marketed. It has been from the start.\nLet me be absolutely clear from the start: this is NOT a free to play game. In it's "free" form, you are playing a demo table, and if you want to get down to playing several tables you have to start forking over money - and quite a bit of it, too.\nThe "DLCs" are not additions to a full game, they are the bundles of tables per "season" that you would otherwise have to buy individually. You can play "trials" of tables you haven't bought yet but they will slap you in the face the moment you actually score decently on them (can't finish a game - you're given the choice "buy now or quit playing")\ni.e.: Free-to-play part = game DEMO. DLC = game.\n\nThen, the actual gameplay:\nThe menu system looks like it's been thrown together by amateurs, is very nonresponsive to input, clumsy to navigate, and there is no steam integration whatsoever.\nThe actual simulation is decent, with proper recreations of table layouts and features of the pinball machines offered, although it lacks the responsive feel and proper physics I've seen in other pinball simulations on the PC. You'd think that in 2013, they'd be able to get physics down as accurately as it gets, but no, not in this one.\nGraphics: very hit and miss; seems the programmers like excessive amounts of bloom lighting, which actually provides a handicap and makes things ugly. Some of the textures used (especially in the surroundings) are simply poor and blurry. Camera angles can be odd, too.\n\nAll in all, I don't recommend it, even for pinball enthusiasts (I'm one, loved playing the hell out of the real deal, lots of nostalgia looking over the lineup) - it's just too poorly executed with trying to push it as if it was free to play, and simply lacking in what you'd really expect from something with all the big names on them.","December 5, 2013","false","1.4"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/penguincamp/recommended/238260/","penguincamp","Flubberdub","http://steamcommunity.com/id/penguincamp/","46 products in account","--A Review By Penguincamp--\n\nWell, I was planning to go to this Pinball Expo that was near my town, but it was cancelled for some reason. I was pretty upset about that, being a big pinball fan, and that put me right in the mood for this game, which I found just recently. I downloaded it and played it, and this is what I have to say about it.\n\nFirst off, the remaking of each pinball machine is actually pretty impressive. I saw some of my favorites such as "Taxi" "Funhouse" "Gorgar" and "Firepower" and they loooked pretty decent compared to their originals. The sounds from each pinball machine doesn't really have a difference compared to the originals as well. There's not a bad variety of pinball machines either, most of them from the more popular pinball companies (Williams, Gottlieb, Bally, Stern).\n\nThe gameplay isn't the best, but it's still bearable. Sometimes the timing of the flippers are a bit off, but I'm just going to ignore that, because in most computer/tablet pinball games I've played, the flippers are always a bit off. The pinball itself has pretty good reactions to the flippers and is pretty accurate. On the top left corner they show the screen on the original pinball machine, as well as the match cutscenes, which is a nice touch. Unfortunately, I don't really know if the match sequence works or not, because one time I actually got a match, but it didn't give me a second try or anything like that, but maybe it was because I was in freeplay mode (I'll talk about that in a second). And I don't think there's actually a way to "shoot again", except in the Harley Davidson pinball machine, which is really disappointing, frustrating, and upsetting.\n\nBut the main reason I don't recommend this is because you can't actually play a full game unless you really suck. They charge you $9 a pinball machine unless you do two things: 1. Buy the Table pack for $30 (with 21 other machines) costing $1.30 a pinball machine; or 2. Play freeplay mode, where you can only play up to a certain score. Nobody's going to pay $1.30 for a SINGLE PINBALL MACHINE, MUCH LESS $9!!!! (If you are going to pay that much I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings or something). If I was in charge of this game, I would probably give people 5 random free pinball machines and charge, I don't know, 50¢ for a pinball machine. MAYBE EVEN 25¢. Unless you love pinball but suck at video games or your a millionaire that loves pinball but just doesn't have enough room in his house to purchase a physical pinball machine, this game really isn't worth your time unless you are starved for pinball so much you will cry your face off unless you get your hands on a pinball machine.","January 5, 2014","false","39.8"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

The graphics are pretty bad (well, tablet quality really), but most importantly the ball physics are seriously off. Is this the best you can do, FarSight? You claim to be the ultimate accurate sim of real-life pinball machines and you can't get the physics down, after years of development? Take a look at the Pro Pinball series which still hasn't been matched in terms of ball physics. What we have here is about as accurate as a real pinball table covered with ice. I've owned and played actual pinball machines for a decade now and I can tell you that the ball should *not* go across the table at 45 degrees when I plunge it from the tip of the flipper. It should go *up*; not to the side! This makes aiming impossible if you're coming from real-life pinball. It's funny, the Future Pinball project had the exact same problem with ball physics. I wonder why...\n\nNot to mention the poor and unrealistic sound effects used for the mechanics; these too seem awfully familiar from open source community attempts at pinball simulation from ages ago... you couldn't get a real machine and an audio tech to sample it for you?\n\nI've been waiting for a properly simulated real-life pinball machine on PC for as long as I've played pinball, but it seems impossible to do right judging by this effort.\n\nFrom an experienced pinball player in real life: not recommended.","July 11, 2015","false","0.1"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","1"

(Tales of Arabian Nights) The rest of the tables either have to be purchased as a season or in table packs. Otherwise the other tables have a score limit.\n\nThe only problem with this game is that the texture and lighting quality is quite bad, is the same as the playstation 2 pinball game released years ago called "Pinball Hall of Fame". In fact this game is almost a port of Pinball Hall of Fame and not a brand new game. Despite many requests for improved textures and lighting Farsight has chosen not to address these issues. I am quite confused as to why farsight is releasing new tables with the quality of playstation 2 textures and lighting.\n\nAlthough I own all four seasons for the Pinball Arcade. The developer ignoring small requests makes me wish I had simply kept money. For a better pinball experience with superior graphics and developer support I recommend zen pinball. Until developer commits to improving the visual quality of it's game I suggest you avoid this title.","December 31, 2014","false","115.4"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","31","4","13","0","0"

This alone makes me never, ever, want to trust these people with a purchase.\n\nThat's right, I had one of the collections in my library, and it was removed for no reason (as it was for many people).\n\n\nLike PBFX2, the game itself is a poor console port with graphics that are actually superior on consoles than pc. "they are working on it" lol.\n\nIf you format / install on other computers, you will have your high scores overwritten. This dev is clueless on how to make a game work correctly.\n\nThe tables are nice recreations of real tables, but the whole thing is very feature lacking, you have to pay double for such features as "free look" meaning getting to move the camera around... which is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. And frankly most of the time the tables just aren't that fun.\nAlso the collections are very expensive.\n\nDon't support console scrub developers who don't care or understand how to make a PC game.

It's a very novel idea--it allows you to play numerous real life machines in about a 6/10 or 7/10 enviornment.  Why do I rate it so low?  The physics.  The good news is that we're far beyond the early 90s where multiballs just pass through other balls.  The bad news is if you want a 'real' experience, you'd be best to look at the Pro Pinball! series by Empire Interactive from many years ago.\n\nExamples of differences between real pinball/this game:  Flippers don't have the same hydraulic movement that they do in real life--many tricks you can do because of the motion of the flipper are altered or not possible (drop catches for one).  The playfields have no dings / scratches / variable friction (Pro Pinball series actually simulates a 'worn in' machine to your liking) so the ball will travel in a pefectly consistent manner.  Flipper power is inconsistent--I've never seen a machine in my life that had flippers so powerful on Star Trek TNG.\n\nThere are very very few solid physics simulations on top of good gameplay for pinball machines.  It's basically the group that made monster's fair + the pro pinball series, followed by everyone else.  The pinball arcade belongs in the group of virtual pinball machines I'd definitely consider playing and are better than 75% of those out there, and loosely just as good as another 15%-20%.  It's not that 5% though and that's why I'd not recommend it.  Try it--make sure you're happy with what you're getting before shelling out the dosh.  It's enjoyable and can be a wicked fun night of nostalgia.","February 8","false","0.5"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

Now, the pay as you play feature would be fine, except it forces you into buying tables by season, as opposed to choosing individual tables you want in your collection.

I've changed my review several times for PA. At its best, Pinball Arcade is great. Tables like Fun House and Taxi are gems - well designed and fair tables.\n\nUnfortunately the majority of the tables are very poorly designed. They aren't bad because the developers of PA did a bad job, PA does an accurate job, as far as I can tell, of recreating these tables. Unfortunately, these badly designed tables are designed to lighten your wallet by draining the ball with incredible frequency. That would be annoying in the arcade, on the computer it is annoying and pointless. Not that FarSight can do anything about this, they are doing their job in accurately recreating these tables.\n\nI'm sure pinball experts will say that the problem is that I lack skill with pinball. I'm sure this is true, but a well designed game will give you an incentive to build your skill by rewarding you with higher scores. Having the ball drain through no fault of the player is not an incentive to continue playing, it is an incentive to move on to a better designed pinball table - a Pinball FX2 table.","May 26","false","52.1"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","3","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MistaX88/recommended/238260/","MistaX88","MistaX88","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MistaX88/","127 products in account","Just like with Pinball FX2, Pinball Arcade is worth a try since you can play one table for free and you can try out some of the other tables for a short amount of time. There is also the added bonus of "free table of the month" where different tables are available to play in full when you select "play trial version".\n\nI played FX2 before I played this, so I will probably go into some comparisons with that, so this review might be more helpful for those who have played that one are are wondering if this game is also worth it. I'll start out with the pros:\n\nPros:\n-Well done recreations of real life pinball tables.\n-Decent virtual pinball physics (but different feeling than FX2, I'll elaborate later).\n-Plenty of great, tried and true classic tables to pick from. A few aren't so good but with how many tables there are you will still get your money's worth. I suggest buying them in the packs (and from what I've heard, people are having issues with in game purchases for the Steam version of this game, so you might be best off sticking to the packs).\n\nCons:\n-Textures and lighting definitely need some improvement (improved lighting for the PS4 version, yet we're still left behind here on the PC).\n-Though physics are decent, ball can sometimes be a bit too fast and bouncy, sometimes making it all the way up ramps after a bounce that should barely have made it past the ramp entry.\n-Terrible UI. The menu system looks like it came from a half-broken game from the mid-90's, and it doesn't feel very responsive. Tables are selected from one long list and can't be sorted in any way.\n-The extra features you get for the "pro versions" of the tables are not worth the extra price. I don't see why anyone should have to pay extra just to have access to the operator menu and a few other minor bells and whistles.\n\nNow, a bit more on the physics and the feel of the game. I did a short review for Pinball FX2 a while ago and was perhaps a bit over-zealous calling the physics spot-on. The physics in both these games feel very good, the best I've ever felt in a pinball videogame, but they are both a bit different and reality actually falls right in the middle of the two. If you are used to Pinball FX2 but have never played a real table, I can describe the ball as being a bit "heavy" and it makes flipper catching and gaining control just a bit too easy. In Pinball Arcade, the ball seems to feel a bit "light", sometimes traveling too fast and making some wierd bounces that send it up ramps and into places it normally would never go (yet despite the extra bouncing I almost never see "airballs"). It also makes flipping catching and gaining control a bit more difficult.\n\nIf you've never played on a real pinball table (or have only played a few times and it was a long time ago or something similar) then this probably won't bother you. However, if you have at least some experience on any of the real life tables in Pinball Arcade then this can become frustrating at times. Balls will bounce into outlanes more than usual and sometimes you'll be struggling to pull off flipper catches that you know you can repeat over and over again in reality. However, this extra difficulty is balanced a bit in the scoring by the fact that the ball might also bounce into places or make it up ramps that might not actually happen in reality.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game. It's a solid pinball title that does a decent job recreating real life tables. Just don't expect it to be perfect.","January 7, 2015","true","18.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought it a year or two, back on XBOX 360, and every table pack they released.. the problem is, they only released 3 or 4, then stopped.. while the content kept coming on the PSN store.  I don't care why, but it REALLY sucks I had to pay for stuff twice, just to be able to get an up-to-date version.  That being said, if you have never bought this before, it is REALLY good (I own every table released by Zen Pinball on XBOX, but I really like how these are authentic tables.. ones I actually played growing up).  Zen Pinball has the edge as far as overall performance and presentation, but this is not far off at all.  Despite my jaded perspective towards feeling like the developer's screwed me, I HIGHLY recommend this.  At least get it for free while you can still get a free table (and a pretty decent one from the pick) and see for yourselves.","November 5, 2013","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The physics feel realistic and the tables are lushly recreated replicas of physical pinball machines. The game features a good mix of popular tables, lesser known machines, and classics that're likely older than you are. Unfortunately, pricing is an issue; the game is 'free' with only one table, and limited demos of all other tables, and tables are only sold in packs of two and 'season' sets of all the tables released in a certain timeframe. These season sets are also at set prices, even as they place less tables in later seasons.  If there's only a couple of tables you want to play, they're likely bundled with another table you may or may not want, or you may pay for a whole season set, or get the 'pro' edition, which allows you to play with the physics and for certain licensed tables lets you scan the playfield to see the art, which is frustrating as it's not an intrisic feature included in all tables so you can see the work that was put into recreating these machines. Regardless, it's fun pick-up-and-play game, and it can help you learn-and play- the history of video games. Try your favorite table or wait for a season / pro set to go on sale. Recommended tables from Season One (only season I have) include Big Shot, Creature From The Black Lagoon In 3-D, Taxi, and Theater of Magic.","October 11, 2014","true","47.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you've never played pinball you can get a knack for it playing this game and will you be able to play real boards (after you get used to that board's flippers). My wife and I have had a great amount of fun playing many of the boards, but our favorite has to be Medieval Madness.","October 11, 2014","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
