I'll be honest, I went into this game expecting to hate it.  I'm happy that I was wrong and I offer my sincere apologies to '11-Bit Studios' for doubting you! A respectful bow and a tip of the hat to you! :)\n\nThis gem flew under the radar for lots of people. If you're a fan of the genre, you'll not be disappointed! The UI is very slick looking and responsive. It's also easy to pick-up and play thanks to a simple control scheme and well-done tutorial system. You can feel the passion, time, and quality, that the developers poured into this game. The production values alone are impressive. If you're just looking to have a good time and kick-back with a genre you know and love, stay the course! But If you've got a wii-touch of Sadism inside you that craves a seemingly unfair situation, like me, then the game has plenty of challenges to quench that hunger, too. Especially during that last couple of Campaign Missions.\n\nThat isn't to say, the game has no flaws. There are moments during the story, that are cliche and can be seen coming a mile away. While having a fully voiced cast can add a lot to a game experience, it only takes one person to ruin it. Certain cutscenes (seems like the unskippable ones?) move your camera/focus towards a scene on the other side of the map, without pausing the action. I've lost count of how many units have fallen in the line of cutscene-fire. A dislike of mine that probably doesn't bother anybody else, is the Commander's skill-set. The skills themselves are fine. It's the fact that the Commander is unable to offer any regular(gun) damage of his own. Even if it's just a tiny amount...every little bit, counts.\n\nSince I don't wanna end this review on a sour note, I definatly recommend this game","April 19, 2015","true","4.3"," 42 of 50 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","42","50","0","0"

Its a top down somewhat tower defense game... only in reverse. You lead a squad of vehicles that must take clear cut streets through enemy defenses, but you select the route and your caravan just keeps following the path you set for them. So imagine a train that cannot stop on a tracks with multiple paths. If something blocks your train track, you divert your train at the next intersection by going to a tactical route map and just clicking on the intersection to point their next direction to head in. Its really as easy as that. You don't control the vehicles so much as just point out the route to take. You do have a player character to control. There is a 'speed up / turbo' button to make the game go faster.\n\nSince you're going through a warzone, the enemy has turrets, and other defenses setup to slow you down. So this is like you play the part of a GPS and they'll do the fighting as they come upon enemies. You can buy more vehicles for your caravan, upgrade current vehicles (for the same price as buying them new) and assign their formations. Like do you select a less defensive more offensive vehicle to go first or do you select a more defensive less offensive vehicle? Another thing to consider is range of attack. The 'attack crawler' vehicle has a longer range, but it is considerably weaker than the 'defender APCs.' Eventually you'll get shielders that will provide a shield for the vehicles directly in front and in back of them in the caravan train. There are also tanks that you will unlock later. In all the game's player vehicles seem limited in diversity.\n\nAs a commander, you have abilities that you collect. The first is to repair your vehicles in a radius of where it is used for a specific time as the train keeps rolling. Your player character isn't limited to staying with the caravan, he can go out and wander to find things. This is a very simple yet engaging. The only downside is the controls could be better. A lot of times my commander was accidentally walking all over the place when I wanted him to repair things. Just because you hit the abilities menu, then select the ability with the mouse. Well when you use the mouse it makes your player character walk. The other abilities are, smoke screens that will cover vehicles in a radius preventing some cannons from hitting them and then decoys that will attract larger cannons that would otherwise accurately hit your vehicles in a smoke screen. Finally, there is a bomb target to bluntly bomb enemies. It might seem cheap, but it is useful for wide beam cannons that keep streaming a draining vehicles.\n\nEventually the challenge outweighs the fun just gets too much on even the normal difficulty. When you have limited resources, money and enemies keep getting more and more powerful, such as giving enemies a damage radius to every bullet and enemies that ressurect destroyed towers. Once one of your vehicles is destroyed, I find myself wanting restart from the last checkpoint, because I know that one vehicle down will make my train too weak to beat later levels.\n\nEach level seems healthy time wise and you get to select your level of difficulty. It is definitely worth a play. Good instructions, good voice work explaining everything in a simple manner.","June 26, 2013","true","18.2"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","31","35","0","0"

Without these ability, your troops will surely get killed and you will fail, so keep an eye on them.\n\nThe graphics of Anomaly: Warzone Earth is beautiful, not so advanced, but very pleasing on the eye, perfectly crafted.

I was incredibly impressed.  The menu and UI is slick, the control scheme is well thought out and plays almost entirely with the mouse right out of the box.  It has controller support and touch control support (mobile game) and the backgrounds and models are beautifully rendered and look high quality.  The gameplay is interesting too - it's kind of a reverse tower defense.  I found it refreshing and fun, and the difficulty really ramps up in the later levels.  I played on Casual, if you turn it up to really hard I'm sure it would knock your socks off.  There are also online leaderboards and automatic ranking notifications, challenge modes, and it's fully voice acted.  Everything in the game screams care and quality.  No corners were cut and you could tell the developers spent the time to make sure things were done *right*.\n\nAnomaly is good for pick up and play gaming, but I think grinding it out would get tedious after awhile - it's great for mobile gaming and to kill time a level at a time on the PC.  I'd recommend picking it up if you're looking for something to play intermitantly or giving it a shot if you picked it up in an indie bundle and have it sitting in your library.

You're in control of "invading" units in pre-built maps. At the beginning of each stage, you select your squad based on money you have. You can set/change route of your squad any time you want, change their formation, upgrade their abilities, sell/buy units during mission. You'll have different goals like getting to the end point, destroying some towers along the route, escorting safely some unit to the end, etc. Enemy towers doesn't respawn (in most levels), nor upgrade, so you can plan your strategy ahead.\n\nBesides your squad "on rails", you control the commander - unit which can freely roam the field. His mission is to provide help to your squad with healing, diversions and air strike. He can also be killed, but he respawns after several seconds, unlike other units. Commander is equally important as your other units, so you must learn to use him wisely.\n\nOnce you get familiar with game mechanics, you can finish this game with almost same unit formation every time on any difficulty, but nevertheless, game is addictive and very fun to play. I highly recommend playing in combination with steam achievements which adds interesting tasks to do during missions (which also makes the game more difficult).\n\nOverall, if you like tower defense games, you probably won't regret getting this game.","December 27, 2015","true","38.7"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

I had no idea this would actually be all that entertaining. I'm a big fan of tower defense games, and this is a pretty good example of it flipped over. The graphics are very nice, the only other TD game. The game is beautifully voiced. Has a typical, yet working storyline. The mechanics are very dynamic, fast-paced, yet easy to learn.

But was I wrong! This is actually surprisingly well made and fun for the most part of it!\n\nFor the main game there is 14 missions and 3 side (Bonus?) missions. Now don't get me wrong that sounds like a small number but there is pleanty of awesome gameplay and things to do to keep you interested for hours! Hence, here is my thoughts on it:\n\nPros:\n‚ô¶ Great Graphics\n‚ô¶ Amazing Voice Overs (Every game needs high quality voice overs like this one)\n‚ô¶ Awesome Gameplay that is challenging at times and will take you hours to finish (It took me 12.5hours to get all but 2 achievements)\n‚ô¶ Medals per level make the game that little bit more fun and challenging (This is an awesome concept that makes you want to keep playing to get them all)\n‚ô¶ 44 Achievements with achievements per level (This is epic as there is not only gold medals to achieve but individual achievements per level for doing certain challenge type things unrelated to the levels main objects which keeps the levels interesting for a longer time)\n‚ô¶ 3 difficulties per level (These add an even more challenging and fun aspect to the game)\n‚ô¶ Steam Trading Cards\n‚ô¶ Leaderboards (Even though some of the scores seem impossible to get, this is a nice addition as each level is ranked individually and you can compare your score to friends and the global Steam users which adds a nice competitive aspect to the game)\n\nCons:\n‚ô¶ Bonus levels Baghdad Mayhem and Tokyo Raid seem repetitive (This is bad as they are wave based and just seems like the levels were last minute as every wave is the same)\n‚ô¶ Bonus levels are numbered weirdly (Levels 1 and 3 are in Baghdad Mayhem and 2 is in Tokyo Raid. IMO they should have made them seperate from each other as they pretty much are)\n‚ô¶ Tokyo Raid's highscores seem unreachable (I destroyed almost every tower bar like 3 and was nowhere near number 1 highscore)\n‚ô¶ The way you unlock some Medals seems unconsistant (For example Directiveness in one level may be really straight forward and then you do the same the same things you did in the next level to get the directiveness medal and it doesn't unlock which is really annoying)\n‚ô¶ Story could have been better (Seemed kind of lame to me, some may enjoy it though)\n‚ô¶ Some Cutscenes seemingly don't pause the game which is annoying as I've come back to the game to find my unit die due to the timing of the cutscene (Really annoying as you only have limited money per level!!).\n\nOverall, for a Reverse Tower defense where you control the units the game is on par with many hours of fun, challenging and competitive gameplay to be had. Despite the repetitiveness of the Bonus levels and the bad Storyline the game is interesting, has many achievements and you will enjoy playing it and coming back to better your score or beat your difficulty or even beat your highscore or your friends! Well worth buying and playing if you are appealed by the concept of Reverse Tower Defense!\n\n","April 23, 2015","true","12.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","1"

There are several different enemy towers, and each one can pose a serious threat if you don't approach it with good strategy. And in addition to encountering various tower setups, the game often throws other challenges your way too, such as needing to get across a bridge in the area before it gets destroyed, or having to evade powerful area artillery strikes from the enemy, and so on.\n\nThe game is really fun if you like tactical gameplay, but it's also pretty relentless and hard, even on Casual difficulty. If you're looking for a casual, relaxing game, you won't find it here. But if you're seeking a challenge, you'll be right at home. Unfortunately the game's checkpoint system can sometimes work against you. If you happened to reach a chekpoint when you're low on ability supplies and your vehicles are in poor shape, you might find yourself unable to make progress past the next area, and returning back to the previous section becomes impossible after a checkpoint. These times could cause you having to restart the whole level from the beginning.\n\nIn addition to the 14 campaign missions, you also get some bonus challenges (Baghdad Mayhem and Tokyo Raid) which you can try out, where you're given a series of tasks (not related to the story) in an area and you must complete them. Overall, the presentation is pretty good. Great visuals, adrenaline-pumping music, and nice voice acting.

The levels are well varied in type, as well as some interesting challenge mode to boot after you finish the main campaign.\n\nOnce you work out the optimum build order, you will soon find your self powering through the levels. I especially like how you control a commander, which helps out by using powerups, such as a repair or activate a shield around your convoy of units.\n\nI can highly recommend Anomaly for anyone's time, with the addition of challenge modes, there is hours of gametime here.","March 10, 2015","true","14.3"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","19","31","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/91200/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1777 products in account","The premise behind Anomaly: Warzone Earth is that of reverse tower defense. Instead of setting up your defense towers in lanes and waiting for the enemy to attack, your job is to attack towers that have been set up by aliens through various campaign missions. While this may sound like it makes the tower  defense genre more interesting, and provides a much needed change in a fairly strict genre, the truth is, it does not. Graphically, it's serviceable. The developers did a decent job porting the game from mobile devices, even though there aren't that many options besides resolution. The artwork varies from creatively rendered post-apocalyptic cities around the world, to alien structures and weaponry. Voice acting is below average, but it isn't too bad. The British accent in particular sounds fake and over the top. As for the plot, it's your below average teenage action science fiction with very little substance and grossly lacking in twists. Overall,  Anomaly: Warzone Earth is predictable from beginning to end, if you can stomach finishing the game. From its presentation, to the mechanics, to the storyline, there isn't anything that rewards the player, or provides a sense of accomplishment and value. Playing the game feels more like an annoyance. It also suffers from a severe lack of depth and range. There are only four unit types, six enemy types, and only four commander abilities that can only be activated if you pick up their ability icons that are dropped on the map by supply planes. There is very little variation from mission to mission, and even though upgrading your units is an option, there is very little reason to do so, as you will need to get more units on the field instead. Having only one or two upgraded units go through the lanes is guaranteed suicide. Another very serious problem with Anomaly: Warzone Earth is the difficulty. Even at the easiest setting, there will be some more advanced campaign missions that are nearly impossible to beat unless you do exactly what the developers wanted you to by design. There is no choice to be made. Finishing those artificially difficult missions is not due to skill or through learned strategies, but by saving and repeating the same abilities you have been abusing of throughout the entire campaign. There is no strategy nor skill involved. You simply repeat the same steps over and over, for every mission. It doesn't really matter what enemies you are facing, or what the pointless mission objective is. The game gives you a false sense of decision making, and a false sense of strategy. It feels like all actions being done in-game are worthless and with no consequences. It's almost like the game plays itself. Only needing you to click a bit, instead of looking stupid as you poke your phone or your tablet, if you were playing on the game's original mobile platform. There are many other tower defense games that provide the player with actual choice of action and strategy. Anomaly: Warzone Earth does nothing to make the tower defense genre better. In fact, it makes it worse.\n\nAnomaly: Warzone Earth is mediocre.","March 20, 2014","false","5.4"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

It will not give you many ways to accomplish missions, most of the times the scripted events are so obvious that you will know for sure when an ''anomaly'' hits the short route you decided to take, giving you only the choice to switch to the longer, more risky route.\nDespite of these scripted events and a bit of failed voice acting from every character, this is a very good game. It's refreshing an old, almost lost genre.\n\nPros:\n+ Tower defense at its best, plus somethig more\n+ Suspanse at every corner, especially on higher difficulties\n+ The AI is surprisingly good for an almost indie game\n+ Nice and simple leaderboards display, depending on the difficulty you play\n\nCons:\n- Short campaign; tiny fast-paced levels\n- Scripted events will become obvious before they even happen, after 1h of gameplay\n- The buy/sell/upgrade function is simple.

What started out as fun turned into annoying and micro. If you want to be any kind of efficient at the game you have to micro your units order to keep the damage off of them. Adding to that you have annoying missions. I just completed an escort one, I mean what is that doing in this kind of game? I just couldn't keep myself playing, felt more like I was forcing myself to beat it rather then enjoy it. I won't finish.\n\n(Old review based mostly on Demo) : Great twist on the tower defense genre by reversing it. Instead of building towers to defend you are maneuverings to destroy them. The strategy elements are there in the tactical view where you tell the units what path to take. However you only directly control a single unit which has four abilities to support the units on the field. Add to the the ability to change the order of the units  as well as upgrade them and you have a fun addicting game.","December 27, 2011","false","5.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The basic strategy is to maneuver through the streets in such a way that you bite off a few towers at a time. Take on too many at once and you quickly find yourself overwhelmed, burning through your allotted health and decoy upgrades.\n\nDespite thin gameplay, the game's presentation is excellent.

Game mechanics are simple with 6 unit types vs 6 tower types. The story introduces new game elements at a perfect pace. Achievements are mostly easy. The Advanced difficulty ones are clever and put a twist on each of the 14 missions similar to Starcraft 2's Hard Story achievements. Further replayability is there with the contrasting gold medals forcing you to play each mission differently. Tokyo Raid gold medals are very time consuming and challenging though so it's not all easy.

Also it is not very well optimated game - it runs too heavy for a game what it is.\n\nIt has some good things going on - and I while definitely recommend Anomaly: Warzone Earth Mobile Campaign for android gaming device - and the music of Piotr Musial is brilliant in all anomaly games - however as hundreds of great games exist, Anomaly: Warzone Earth is probably not worth your time.","November 25, 2013","false","2.3"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/91200/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","TLDR: Anomaly Warzone Earth is a ‚Äúreverse tower defense‚Äù game where you control a convoy trying to get through the mazes of enemy tower placements in an urban setting. Mix up your unit loadout and upgrade your units on the fly as you run alongside them using ‚Äúspecial powers.‚Äù\n\nAccording to the game‚Äôs opening cinematic, in the not too distant future a bunch of mysterious objects fall from the sky, and end up encasing themselves is massive domes that the military call anomalies. You play a military commander tasked with infiltrating the anomalies and eliminating the alien menace inside.\n\nThe game‚Äôs single player campaign has 14 discrete levels, where you control not only the commander on the field, but the convoy of vehicles which you need to guide through the level. It‚Äôs your choice whether to avoid or engage the alien towers that are set up all over the maps by manipulating the routes they take, similar to switching train tracks on railroads. Generally you should choose to find and destroy them since you earn money with which to upgrade or purchase more units. You get access to about half a dozen different unit types by the end of the game but it‚Äôs likely that you‚Äôll stick to your favorites and just upgrade rather than having a large group of weak units. The vehicles are autonomous, you don‚Äôt choose who they fire at, just which direction they take through the cities. The ‚Äúskill‚Äù portion of the game is in how you use your special powers in the field. Your little commander unit doesn‚Äôt have guns of his own, but he can ‚Äúcast spells‚Äù such as repair, smoke screen, or decoy that make all the difference when your convoy is under fire. By the last level, you‚Äôll be a spell casting fiend, just firing off your skills left and right as you‚Äôre bombarded by an overwhelming number (and variety) of enemy towers.\n\nPros:\n+The game‚Äôs story is engaging and frames each level so you don‚Äôt just have 14 maps to play, you‚Äôre actually advancing the story, exploring the anomalies and the aliens‚Äô plans.\n+The variety of units you can use and enemy towers is surprisingly complex. Some of the enemy towers are a major pain in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, like the one that absorbs energy if you use a special power within its line of sight.\n\nCons:\n-The game is quite difficult at times, despite the ‚Äúcasual‚Äù difficulty setting. I tried replaying the game recently after about a year, just to experience the story again‚Ä¶ and I couldn‚Äôt finish it again. It was fun the first playthrough, but the replayability value of the game just isn‚Äôt that high.\n\nOverall, the game is enjoyable and challenging, and the download size is under a gigabyte so go ahead and give it a try. I ended up not playing the different game modes though, like survival and mayhem. I guess I was just burnt out by the end.\n","August 24, 2015","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The opening intro video made me curious to play the game and see what was going on.\n\n\nI always liked Tower Defenses, but this one as a story within, beautiful graphics and some nice animations.\nYou are not defending, you are attaking. You can choose your paths and change whenever you want, to make strategic plans yourself. Your skills will help you survive and the ability to change the speed of the troops is veryuseful at some points.\n\n\nThe voice acting makes the game enjoyable and I really hope that the sequel implements a multiplayer feature.\n\nSo if you love Tower Defense, in the attacking side and love a "Aliens Invade the modern Earth" story (like Falling Skies or even War of the Worlds) then I would definitely recommend you to try this game.\n\nThe only I would add or change in this game is the mouse pointer, which sometimes makes me confused when there's a lot of action going on. I can't seem to see where is it and sometimes I have to make the character move to realize where is the mouse pointer.\n\n\nOther than the mouse problem:\n9/10","September 2, 2014","true","44.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

To assist in accomplishing this, you're given a series of powers (repair, mask your units' visibility, calling in air strikes, etc) with limited uses, as well as funds to buy/upgrade your units.\n\nThis was my first experience with this sort of game and I found it to be very fun - the variety of enemy towers and layout of levels provided a continually varied experience, and I was more than satisfied to run through the game. On each level you're judged on a few metrics (towers destroyed, units lost, and time) which allows for a certain amount of replayability to get different medals.

Very smooth framerate.\n\nSound: The voice activng is pretty bad and the music is repetetive, but it doesn't take away much from gameplay.\n\nGameplay: 3 modes (Casual, Advanced and Hardcore) makes Anomaly quite fun and challenging...if you want it to be. Very easy to grasp and smooth difficulty scaling. Very polished game.\n\nConclusion: If you are looking for a game with a good story, this isn't it.

I'd periodically lose my little guy on the screen from all the action and it made moving/scrolling a nuissance at times as my guy would be stuck on the backside of building or something and not moving.

And on the top of that you can't even save properly - only by checkpoints, which sometimes are placed without any thought given to it.

It's a game where you build and upgrade towers to defeat waves of enemies and, later on, bosses trying to destroy your [insert something random here like a base or village]. If you've seen one of them you've seen pretty much all of them. Not this one though. This one is different. It's a reverse-tower defense title, meaning you have to run with an actual character and guide your tanks across a city. Along the way alien towers spawn on the sides of the road and it's up to you to change your formation, help them out yourself with dropping small nukes and smoke bombs and create a safe path using a virtual map of the city. It's actually quite refreshing and I suggest to anyone who loves TD games (like I do) to buy and try.\n\n[Rating: 85/100]","June 12, 2011","true","6.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is a great game. And this time I really didn't know what to expect at all from the game when I bought it. I just found the artstyle so appealing. I thought this would be another modern RTS game, this time with really stylish graphics that I'd enjoy to look at but never really gonna like to play ... but man was I wrong ...\n\nAt it's core Anomaly is a Tower Defense game. Only this time you're not playing the defending but the offending forces. So this time around you are playing a commander of a motorised squad that will attack the towers but can't be controlled directly by you. You can offcourse set the routes for your squad and you have some special abilities like repairing, laying smoke curtains to hide or placing decoys to protect your units and so on.\n\nThe style of the graphics, the sound, the music, the voice overs event the menus ... everything is blended perfectly alltogether to give a pretty unique gameplay experience of a sort I personally haven't encountered before.\n\nThis game sucks you right in from the first minute because of its very unique style and easy accessibility featuring perfect XBox 360 controller support. Even the story is nicely spread out through the campaign. On top of that it seems to feature a good portion of replayability by offering a ton of missions: First there is the story mode, then there are two campaigns based on locations from the story mode and after that you can still play on in some bonus missions with extra difficulty and slight twitches to the original gameplay mechanics.\n\nI liked very much what I've seen unti now and I can wholeheartedly recommend you to buy this game, exspecially when it's on sale. But I must say (and I don't say this often) this game is even worth it's full price. So go on and get it if you're in for some thrilling action strategy sort of game you haven't seen anywhere else before.\n\n@ngel","October 6, 2014","true","4.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game is pretty intense and every second matters. The game has multiple difficulty settings that fit all levels of player experience. Only complaint is they could have added more save points to make the game a little less frusterating but overall it's still a good and fun game.\n\nBonus: This game is also available for Android and iOS but you will have to pay for it a second time.

It's Tower Defense-y enough for fans of the genre I guess, but far from being as tedious and slow.\n\nWhen the action gets hot, positioning and multitasking become key and the game does a splendid job at making you feel awesome about blowing up cityblock-sized holes into the enemy defense line.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brogbo/recommended/91200/","Brogbo","DrBrogbo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brogbo/","1650 products in account","A very refreshing take on the tower defense series.\n\nThe graphics are really good, and the music is pretty driving as well. The voice acting is good as well, other than the HORRIBLE fake Japanese accents. How hard is it to find someone with an actual Japanese accent?\n\nSuperficial stuff aside, the gameplay is really solid. It's a blast having to manage your team, forming a good balance between offense and defense, planning your route strategically, all while using your commander to jump into the fray to heal units or call in strikes without getting him killed. It's really a welcome layer of strategy on top of the (what I consider to be) tedious tower defense genre.\n\nWhat didn't work so much for me was how the game seems to demand perfection. Granted, that's pretty much the tower defense genre anyway, but I was hoping this game would take a step backwards in that regard. If you lose even one of your units, not only will you most likely not have the resources needed to replace it, but you will be facing a DRASTICALLY harder battle. Borderline impossible, on any difficulty other than casual.\n\nUnfortunately, that means you will be doomed to replay the same mission over and over until you find the perfect formula for success.\n\nI am not a fan of games that devolve that way, but I genuinely enjoyed this one. I didn't play any of the extra modes though, as I was mostly done with it by the time I replayed the final mission for the 2-dozenth time.\n\nMy suggestion is to give a rating to the tower defense genre as a whole on a scale of 1-100 and add 20 points to it. If you like/love tower defense games, you will enjoy this. If you are meh about them, you will still probably enjoy this. If you have never found a tower defense game that you really liked, then only pick this up in a massive sale.","February 15, 2013","true","4.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravenize/recommended/91200/","ravenize","Ravenize > *","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravenize/","338 products in account","I got really excited when I frist heard about this "reverse tower defense" or "tower offense" game. I played the first few levels and then it took me YEARS between then and ever feeling motivated to play the game again. I finally did and finished it and to my surprise it's only a couple hours long. Even doing everything I wanted to (bonus missions, mission-specific achievements, etc.) did not add that much time.\n\nBut I'm thankful for the short length, because I did not enjoy it.\n\nThe game's concept is great, but the execution is not good. Despite the fact that the game keeps introducing new enemies and units right up through the last mission - which actually sucked because you never had the full system figured out until the very end - I found myself oscillating between two very undesirable points.\n\nThe first was more common: most levels were so easy as to be boring, even on higher difficulties. The second was shear frustration: getting stuck. The checkpoint system is totally inconsistent, as in some levels it will repeatedly reward you the same check point an infinite number of times, so that you can just get it as many times as you want, even every 10 seconds. But in other levels you'll go 15 minutes of gameplay without one and then have to reload. Frustraing. Annoying. And because of the set paths and limited resources if you do get a checkpoint late in a hard level where you don't have much money or health or abilities it might actually be impossible to finish the level and you have to restart. Accepting that is a painful process, but in some cases it's the only way forward.\n\nSo for such a short game with a cool concept I feel like I got disproportionately frustrated and annoyed.\n\nThe icing on the cake is that the story and the dialogue are abysmal.","February 13, 2015","false","15.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Pro clicks include making vehicles move, shoot and sometimes heal.  The graphics are amazing on my broken laptop screen, and the music/sound really swelled me up and lifted my spirits when I turned it off.\nYou may hear that this game is boring but let me tell you they are wrong.  I have not experienced pulse pounding action like this since I turned on my computer five minutes ago.  From the first "level" (do they still call these levels?) the game grips you with it's high octane mixture of vehicles moving, and you pointing at things to kill/heal.  I lost 6 pounds playing this game due to the anxiety and sweat that filled my being.\nI'm better now, so I can come back and tell you about this amazing game.  Buy it now.

If you hate escort missions or any game where you have a companion that keeps taking all the aggro and its your job to stand by and keep them alive... well you are going to hate this game.\n\nI think it is a creative take with a good design.

Boring.\n\nIt is basically following the standard of tower defense and action games, but it also attempts to place a detailed story within the game, which I wasn't able to follow. To me it felt like I was being force-fed to believe and understand everything that was going on. Gameplay was also lacking my interest, and just seemed to be covered up by so-called "graphics".\n\nEh, it was good for a key giveaway game.","June 13, 2014","false","3.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's two big flaws though are that the difficulty spikes badly: missions 1-9 = too easy, mission 10 = insanely hard. And timed missions. They are horrible, as they are in most games. Trust me, game developers, nobody wants ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing timed missions in games, nobody. They aren't fun, just stressful.\nI didn't plan on buying Anomaly 2, but I bought the sequel anyway because I stupidly based my purchase on a hope and prayer that they would remove timed missions and fix the difficulty spike. I am sure that neither of those things will happen, so it's basically yet again a waste of $15 on Steam because I have a Steam buying addiction.","May 7, 2013","false","11.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I like the idea of being able to be on the other side of the tower wall for once. Sadly... I'm not really into the play style that much. It's not bad, it's just not what I\ thought it would beo. I was hoping for something like the old WarCraft 3 custom map, Stronghold v3.4 (which most of you probably haven't played). This, of course is completely different. It's a good time waster, something to do when you have nothing else to do. Or maybe, this looks like something you can't wait to play! Either way, if it looks interesting to you, I'd recommend you check it out.","October 5, 2014","true","0.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

You plan your route carefully with planning and thought, after you get to choose the loadout of vehicles you wish, after you try and survive the terrors of the Alien lifeforms which has taken over Baghdad and other ares round that part. Overall it makes me feel like I am playing a tower defense game, but instead of planning to defend whatever I need, I am actually moving through, while the Alien lifeforms is planning its way on defending either its power cores or just trying to ruin your day by just shooting you non-stop. Overall the graphics and music are great, the voice acting is good and the story is actually quite a good story, kinda weird as I was just expecting soldiers trying to move their way through either a group of terrorists or shooting their way through to get out of Baghdad, like Jagged Alliance or Doorkickers.\n\nThe game is great, short, but challenging as you may die a lot for poor planning, but thankfully their is a good checkpoint system where if you die or want to start over again, you can just start from the checkpoint. A great first game from 11 Bit Studios!\n\nRECOMMENDED :)","June 7, 2014","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That is, the game is uncomplicated enough that you can easily see the results of your choices: Maybe you need a unit with longer range? Maybe a different path through the environment would help? Maybe trading some firepower for a shield unit really is the way to go? Maybe the shortest path isn't actually the best one?\n\nIn all cases, the feedback loop between your choices and game outcomes is short, easy to parse, and fun. When you do make a fatal mistake, the punishment is rarely so high that you become frustrated. Also, the game's "macro" pacing seems excellent. There's always a new tower or new twist to adapt to, and yet there's also always time to get a handle on the new problem. The game beautifully manages to act as its own tutorial without giving you the feeling that it's all strange or forced.\n\nFrom my perspective, the developers show real genius in their ability to polish and present a "low budget" concept.

Tower offense has proven to be a nice way to play with the same 'feel-good' rush you get when you upgrade a new unit and then take down an enemy with it. If you like tower defense or Defense Grid: Awakening, you have to download the demo of this and then buy it. The music adds punch to each map and is used to create tension rather than annoy. It's well-composed enough to even be easily ignored so you can concentrate on keeping that shield generator up. The unit variance is perfectly balanced so that you don't have too many, and the resource acquisition is paced well enough so you never feel like your being short-changed (on casual). There are three modes; casual, advanced and hardcore. I'm not sure what they do to scale the difficulty, but it could be anything from tapering the resupplies to raising the damage done by enemy towers. It's a great title that you can just pick up and play for 10 minutes and have a good time.","December 27, 2011","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a game genre that I hardly see around, a reverse tower defence where you have to assault something and you are the "invader", not the "defender". Pretty cool game, nice graphics, sound, the gameplay is very enjoyable. Difficulty is perfectly balanced. The best thing of this game is the fact that it can't just be won by brutally attacking with random units but require a decent tactic, thus making this a fairly decent strategy game. Would totally reccomend it to every fan of strategic games.

Its different approach to the genre (you command the wave(s) and have to fight your way to the end of the mission destroying the cpu's towers) it's quite fresh and offers a different perspective to the fans. While the story is really...well... absolutly awful, the gameplay is pretty solid and easy to master.\n\nBut this is the main problem of Anomaly too. It's too easy and light. There are only six different units you can control and only four "powers" you can deploy (healing, smoke granades, luring mines and, obviously, the air strike). I've earned all the gold medals available in the main story, completed all the achievements in advanced mode (plus some other achievs) and i've failed like..mm..2 times.\n\nIn conclusion i reccomend this game only if you really like TD games and want a really bland difficulty experience.\n\nPROS:\n+ quite cheap and not so short\n+ nice graphic (for the genre)\n+ badass tanks\n\nCONS:\n- too easy\n- only 5 different units\n- a bit boring sometimes","April 7, 2015","true","26.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have to protect your convoy as you navigate through an alien invaded world by tactically aligning your vehicles/survivors and using your special abilities and reinforcements to survive. It's a neat idea, but not my thing. If you like tower defense games, and/or are burning out on them then give this  a try, it also has more story than most TD games.

Abandoning the traditional tower defence gameplay that we are familiar with, it places players in the role of the attacking force against defending towers.\n\nStory is decent. Set in the near future, alien spacecrafts have landed in major cities around the world. Anomalies are created in these areas, which affect satellites and radars around the globe. You play as the commander of 14th platoon sent to discover the the affects of these anomalies and deal with the threats in the area.\n\nGameplay is a mix of strategy and tactics. Before each level, you can select the types of troops you can bring in as well as upgrading their stats (which is capped at certain level). A map is also displayed which indicates the the roads and tower placements in the area. You need to arrange the best route to reach the objective and go through the least number of towers possible (if you want to preserve your unit's health). When you begin the map, your units will spawn in and begin following the route you created before. At any time, you can go back to the map screen again and change the pathing of your units. The next component of the game is managing your troops. You play as a commander (who can't attack), whose role is to basically protect you units units. There are a number of abilities which are avialble which allows you to either reduce damage dealt to your troops or heal them up. The defensive abilities will create a mark on the map indicating the area which your units will gain the benefits in. Other abilities are more offensive, such as airstrikes, which deal damage to towers. As a unit yourself on the battlefield, you also have health, which when depleted means that you unable to move for a while before respawning again. Units and towers also have health which is indicated by a bar above their model. When you lose all you troops (and unable to create more), the game ends.\n\nThere are few game modes available. First off is the campaign, which takes you to different locations as you deal with the invading aliens. Other modes are unlocked from completing the campaign.\n\nGraphics are good. Unit models and textures are well done. The environment also does a great job at instilling 'warzone' feeling with all the destroyed buldings and debris.\n\nAudio is excellent. The voice acting is well done. Sound effects from explosions and gun fire are good as well.\n\nAnomaly warzone earth is great game that should be played if you want to experience a great 'reversed tower defence' game.","April 25, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are good and the gameplay ideas are unique enough that it stands out.\n\nThat said, the gameplay still has room for improvement. The biggest frustration I had while playing is how little control you have over your units. Sure, you can adjust their order and their route but that's about it. You can't tell them to stop (or even slow down), the best you can do is have them circle the block. You also can't adjust your unit's targetting priorities which means they always shoot at the nearest tower which frequently gets them killed in later levels.\n\nThis lack of control makes this a tentative recommendation, it's worth a playthrough but be prepared to be frustrated sometimes with how stupid your units can be.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ximenes/recommended/91200/","ximenes","Naked Wolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ximenes/","220 products in account","To start, let me say that I love Tower Defense games. Orcs Must Die!, Sanctum, Dungeon Defenders, I love this genre because it's all about controling the flow of the enemy hordes; making them go in one direction versus another, leading them into a well armed trap and shooting them dead. While to some that may seem like it would kill replay value once you know the "optimal" placements, in most games it doesn't because there is always more than one effective way to work the map.\n\nThis game takes Tower Defense and does a 180. You don't control the towers, the towers are the enemy. Instead of planning out how to lay traps, where to place key damage towers and how to funnel enemies towards the kill zone you're tasked with navagating a convoy through a map with multiple path options, strewn with enemy towers intent on killing you. Welcome to Tower Offense.\n\nAside from the convoy's attack power (which you can upgrade with enough money, or replace lost units), you've got special powers that let you repair units, lay down a smoke screen, drop decoys and so one. Each uses a unique 'charge' so you'll be running all over the map going between using the abilites and picking up drops so you don't run out.\n\nHere the camera is what all TD players are used to; top-down isometric. But it's locked at a specific zoom level and can't be zoomed in (not sure why you'd want to, but it needed to be mentioned) and zooming out opens the tactical route map which lets you see where all currently visible enemy towers are on the map (some will pop up as part of the story and won't be visible until then) and plan your convoy's route, letting you change it on the fly in case something happens to block your current route.\n\nIt's a fun game, and a break from the typical TD mindset without needing to add in in FPS elements like the Sanctum series (another fine series of games, BTW) or Orcs Must Die! (which has some RPG elements to it and in 3rd-Person). One key aspect of this game is that it can basically be played using just the mouse, because by default almost all commands are already assigned to Mouse 1, 2, 3 and the wheel (no shoulder buttons), so it's easy to pick up and play, but mastering what routes to take is where you'll spend a lot of time.","June 26, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Think of it as a tower defense game, except you're the attacking side. The game's plot is rather cliche'd but still enjoyable, the graphics are nice, and it has enough elements to provide satisfying gameplay depth. However, the game is rather short, and leaves little time to try out your new units after they are introduced. It also has the misfortune of being saddled with poor voice acting, but that can be ignored, and is actually amusing at times.

You play as a character who can run anywhere you want, your job is to guide the vehicles along a path that will complete multiple objectives. You choose what path they take, choose wisely because you may find yourself sending those vehicles to their doom.\nEach type of vehicle has a different ability, some shield other vehicles, others are for light attack towers and others are for heavy ones. There may be more but it's been a while since I played this.\n\nIt's a very nice game and it's a very welcome change to how tower defence games are made. I found myself enjoying this game more than most tower defence games I've played.\nSo if you want to give it a go, buy it. You won't be disappointed, unless you don't like tower defence games. But then again, you might like this because it's DIFFERENT!\n\nI recommend this game, check it out on YouTube if you're still unsure, or check out other reviews that go into more detail.\nI enjoyed it, perhaps you will too.\n","December 27, 2013","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let's do some castle offense! This is the very first game to introduce such a concept to me; before getting Warzone Earth for free through a promotion elsewhere, I hadn't even thought of the idea! But Anomaly shows that the idea is a very good one, and it makes it a ton of fun. Controlling your troops and strategizing your path on-the-fly makes it seem more of an RTS, and that's really, really good. The enemies and their abilities, as well as your troops and abilities, are quite varied and can present a challenge for even the best of strategy gamers. The ability to change the game's difficulty adds onto that as well. For anyone looking for something truly different, I believe Anomaly: Warzone Earth offers that very difference.","December 27, 2013","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

An alien invasion has taken over the planet and this select British team is here to save the world. The player controls a commander who is on foot and escorts a squad of up to six vehicles and helps defend them while taking out the enemy. The vehicles are the primary offense against the horde of alien turrets blocking their path. The commander can utilize four different abilities which include a decoy, smokescreen, healing, and an air strike, however you must collect tokens to enable those abilities and are typically given a small stash before each mission begins. The abilities are stackable so you can place as many as you want provided you have enough tokens. He can also purchase additional vehicles using money collected by destroying turrets or shooting crystals. Vehicle position and route planning are vital and can be managed while the action is paused. Each vehicle also has three upgrade points that cost money which give it more offensive punch plus additional armor.\n\nIt is a short game of about 4-5 hours. It offers two primary campaigns and a final boss battle. There are also a couple extra missions beyond the story mode. It is a solid game that doesn't offer a whole lot of depth, but it's simplicity is one of it's major strengths. It's a nice spin on the traditional tower defense genre that could open the door for better games of this type in the future.","December 21, 2012","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It keeps you having to constantly think ahead and plan the best path possible to victory.\n\nIf you're an avid RTS player and haven't tried this one yet, I would defiantly suggest it and even recommend it to non-RTS game players as it offers something different.","September 30, 2013","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well actually just Baghdad and Tokyo.\n\nThis is definitely a conspiracy by the way.\n>Platoon 14\n>14 Stages\n>Successor has 14 Screenshots on steam, this 7 (14/2)\n>14 inverted is 41 which is just 1 below 42\n>1. of April (4) is April‚Äôs Fools Day\n>The moment I‚Äôm writing this it has 1337 user submissions, which is never meaning any good at all.\n\nAnyway this game's a total hell of a fun to play and took me about 6 hours to complete on advanced difficulty. Though actually, especially in the first 10 or so stages, it ain‚Äôt anything near advanced. I was pelted with gold medals these stages.\n\nIn the game you're controlling a single infantry unit, the commander, with whom you can run around the map, collect power-ups from fallen towers, or use them on towers or your units. Beneath this you can give your up to 6 military units orders where to go, searching the best routes through the battlefield. The enemy's towers consist of 6 different models, with unique abilities that make the game never get boring.\n\n‚Äî Gameplay 9/10\n\n\nThe story, however, is nothing special. Earth forces against Alien forces with a spice of ‚ÄúWe have got an alien spy in our rows‚Äù\n\n‚Äî Story 3/10\n\nAdditionally annoying is your supervisor-kinda guy. He's such a Military personnel stereotype that can't pronounce a sentence without showing how ‚Äúmanly‚Äù he is, saying stuff like ‚Äúkick their asses‚Äù and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Makes me hate anything military even more. Aside of that the atmosphere being brought in by the music and most importantly the environment  is beautiful. You‚Äôre seriously feeling threatened seeing all the towers in almost totally destroyed cities.\n\n‚Äî Atmosphere 8/10\n\n\nThis is making a constant 7.5/10 for me. I can definitely recommend this game for anyone even just a little into RTS. You‚Äôre gonna have a good time with this.\nCan‚Äôt wait to play Anomaly 2!\n\n\nSide note: I played this on Arch Linux and had no big problems doing so.

Just a twist in the tower defense concept, but a great twist.\n\nNow you are the force trying to pass through. You have to set routes, set the squad, the formation and give them support by fixing units, placing smoke screens or calling air strikes. You may think it's just "set tactics and see what happens", but it is definitely not. Sometimes it becomes a really frantic game in which you will need to be extremely fast thinking and acting to make it.\n\nGraphics are good, mood is well set, there's a little story and lots of voice acting (really good IMO). Difficulty is well adjusted (easy at the beginning, hard at the end).\n\nReally entetaining game.

However, the game is rather short, and leaves little time to try out your new units after they are introduced.

The graphical engine is impressive, well polished and looks excellent. This game can be completed in just under 10 hours.

The gameplay is fairly simple and yet it retains enough compelling strategy to be worth playing. You basically have to plot a route that is most survivable, while gathering most resources. You have control over a commander, who can move anywhere on the battlefield and he is your only means of interaction, enabling you to boost the health of your convoy whilst dropping smoke and calling in air strikes. There are also vehicle upgrades to earn. The convoy appears to move slowly, but you are constantly being set goals and needing to take your eye off it in order to send your commander off on his own. Extra challenging elements are thrown in, such as airborn friendlies plotting their own course across the map.\n\nGraphically and sonically, the game is really quite impressive. Overall it isn't the most amazing game you'll ever play, but it succeeds in being fun and providing a good mix of strategic forward planning with realtime action. The main source of irritation I have found is that there is no save game feature; only a checkpoint system. There's no way to rewind back past the most recent checkpoint. Occasionally, the game surprises you with something you couldn't anticipate and you realise that your strategy up to that point won't enable you to finish the level, which means you have to start again from the very beginning.","February 9, 2014","true","22.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It keeps you having to constantly think ahead and plan the best path possible to victory.\n\nIf you're an avid RTS player and haven't tried this one yet, I would defiantly suggest it and even recommend it to non-RTS game players as it offers something different.","September 30, 2013","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It looks and feels a bit like C&C 3, but I personally enjoy this a hell of a lot more than I did C&C 3. Strategy is key in this, as you can change the route of your convoy at any time, to choose the safest and most easily defendable path to the objective; but occurences mid-mission can flip the situation, so be ready to focus on combat and ability management. Definitely a must-try for anyone looking at TD genre games. ****","July 21, 2013","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's well designed and intuitive, and it manages to fix what's generally boring about tower defense games, by reversing the roles. I think they call it "tower offense".\n\nBasically, instead of protecting a core from incoming enemies using lame towers, you actually lead your units down a path (you can modify the path at any time). With the cash you get by picking up minerals, you can either upgrade your current units or buy new ones.\n\nDuring the game, you also have to walk around the battlefield to grab some items, while your units are still moving. Those items function as area effects and you can use them to repair your units or prevent enemy towers from attacking them.\n\nThe game also does a great job at introducing new elements in every level. It never feels stale or repetitive. It even has a somewhat interesting story, at least for that kind of game. The kind of story that doesn't feel out of place; just short dialogue here and there that subtly introduces new gameplay elements, while giving you an extra incentive to keep playing.\n\nGreat mix of action and strategy. 7.5 / 10.","September 22, 2013","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is really awesome game, much joy of play, pretty graphics and so far no glitches. I really do like the way gameplay works and this was some kind of unexpected surprise to me.\n\nCreators give you a start point and a finish point and your job is to survive and reach the finish while bringing down all the objectives. Upgrade, buy, plan, move and do everything what it takes to win every mission and get your score compared to players from all around the world.\n\nIt is challenging, it is full of action, explosions and nude chicks and the producer of scenarios in this game is not even Michael Bay, but the players.","March 1, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It helps that the Commander (controlled by YOU) doesn't have any weapons to defend himself. Which prevents you from going Rambo and leaving your convoy behind. However you do get useful abilites that will help your men to reach safely to the end zone. All this means you stay close to your team and provide and direct support as a real team leader would.\nYou aren't confined to a single path and can change your route midway through the game. Even as new obstacles pop up it's still in your hands whether you want to brave it and push through, or find an alternate route. However, a few levels do force you to take a certain path for small sections.\nThe enemy towers while challenging haven't got much variety and you learn how to deal with them easily. However the real challenge comes in what direction you need to attack them from. What might seem like the easiest or the shortest path might also be the hardest.\n\nOverall a 7/10\nWould be great if there were more special abilities or enemy tower types","November 10, 2015","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/91200/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","Game wasn't bad, but design flaws started coming up later in the game. It is fun how its the reverse of TD, and you can change your route. It would have been nicer if there was more of a variety of units, as things like the tank is just a straight upgrade of the starting APC, and the dragon can attack 2 sides, but does less damage and has much less range than tank and crawler....so seems not as useful. The problem was, design problems keep from the game from being better. The game says you can change and pick your path, but then uses a unit that will kill your entire squad if you go towards it in the path you are guarding. So there may be 4 paths, but because of the unit you can only use 2 paths, which is kind of a lame attempt at pretending you have more options than you actually do. Also, you get multiple different items, which is fun because you can use different things to get past towers. But then the game shoots itself in the foot and just introduces powerful towers that smoke doesn't work on and bombs don't kill, meaning only your decoy works. So to make new towers completely ignore half my abilities means I no longer have options, and just have to hoard and only hope for 1 specific type of power, which is lame. This means your smoke only helps with starter towers, which is dumb because later in the game they barely do anything anyways. Then the game introduces towers that if you use powers (which you have to to survive) can resurrect all the other towers you killed, which is super dumb. Also the tower has super long range, so avoiding it won't actually do anything. Things like that isn't adding a new layer, its just stacking the deck much more in the opponents favor. This is why you basically have to play easy later in the game. Also the pathfinding is super stupid. You have to plan your own path, but countless times I have gotten past the part I planned, only to realize the path the game was auto taking me was straight up towards a tower that autokills you if you go straight towards, and since you can't turn around (dumb exclusion) you auto die. Other times the auto path would take me in a square, just going in circles, or towards a giant cluster of guys instead of an open area. Since maps are huge you can't be asked to plan everything, especially since there are multiple parts in the game the game uses non-tower mechanics to force you even more down a specific way or away from a certain way. It's not too much to ask to have the game not purposefully go the worst way possible every time, especially since you get caught up in battle and its hard to see the way you are planning to go sometimes. The extras missions are overly hard and kind of dumb since they take away the main point of the main game. Also the levels get kind of repeitive and devolve into the same thing.  7/10.","April 2, 2015","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as a ground unit: Captian that has special abilities to help your team as they take down the enemy towers.","June 5, 2012","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonesr/recommended/91200/","jonesr","JonesR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonesr/","1280 products in account","Anomaly: Warzone Earth is a decent escort mission based game. An alien invasion has taken over the planet and this select British team is here to save the world. The player controls a commander who is on foot and escorts a squad of up to six vehicles and helps defend them while taking out the enemy. The vehicles are the primary offense against the horde of alien turrets blocking their path. The commander can utilize four different abilities which include a decoy, smokescreen, healing, and an air strike, however you must collect tokens to enable those abilities and are typically given a small stash before each mission begins. The abilities are stackable so you can place as many as you want provided you have enough tokens. He can also purchase additional vehicles using money collected by destroying turrets or shooting crystals. Vehicle position and route planning are vital and can be managed while the action is paused. Each vehicle also has three upgrade points that cost money which give it more offensive punch plus additional armor.\n\nIt is a short game of about 4-5 hours. It offers two primary campaigns and a final boss battle. There are also a couple extra missions beyond the story mode. It is a solid game that doesn't offer a whole lot of depth, but it's simplicity is one of it's major strengths. It's a nice spin on the traditional tower defense genre that could open the door for better games of this type in the future.","December 21, 2012","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
