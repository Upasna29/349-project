Looking for a cure, hidden in the plants on the island which you’ll have to collect, study them and synthesise together to create tonics. The game combines elements from a number of genres mixing first person survival, adventure and puzzle elements.\n\nIt is unlike anything else you’ll play. With an intense focus on survival, the game successfully nails the feeling of vulnerability and weakness. A fantastic open-world concept, and a wide variety of materials to collect and craft all together, makes it an extremely compelling game.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=563572966\nSadly there are a few issues with character performance and visual effects. Some objects are quite unattractive on close examination and hard to make out at long range. The character movement alone is quite challenging and you should pay attention where you step in without rolling off the cliff or drown.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=543328022\nIn overall:\n\n*Unique survival experience.\n*Interesting setting and game mechanic.\n*Focus on realism creates a great game atmosphere.\n\nThe game delivers a great atmosphere and visuals with unique gameplay that is easy to get hooked on.\nI highly recommend that anyone with a similar passion for science, discovery, and adventure give Miasmata a try. It is very rough around the edges, but its dedication to its novel niche concept makes it worthwhile.\n\n\n9/10","November 20, 2015","true","18.1"," 132 of 144 people (92%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","92","132","144","9","3"

Everything felt good at first but after a while I left it. Why? This game, in my opinion, is quite limited. For you are not truly free in your actions. Yes, you got an illness and that's a valid handicap to make gaming more interesting. But that doesn't entirely explain why, for instance, I need to redo some actions which are not that interactive.\n\nI'll give you some examples:\n\nDiscovery:\nIn order to know where you are you need to triangulate your position, it is not difficult and neither bad, but it grows dull after a while and then you feel like gonna quit (luckily you can find some maps at times). The map automatically shows your position which you have triangulated (this is okay) adding some unknown areas (quite unrealistic and I did not like it very much). It would have been better giving you a map of the island, or pieces of it, and then had to triangulate. Some books are filled with a rather common plot but still quite interesting at times. Player movements are really odd: it is completely uncomfortable for the character finds very difficult to climb flat hills.\n\nResearch:\n1) You find a flower\n2) You pick it up\n3) You take it back to one of the labs within the island\n4) You run a research over it and soon after process it (in a standardized way indeed for any item you find)\n5) You get an output: an aspirine or some sort of boost or whatever\n\nThis feels very annoying and repetitive after a while. One pro point is that it there's a huge variety of stuff to find and analyse. It would have been quite cool if your working lab had an interactive feature on it.\n\nEnemies:\nThe only enemy you have is some sort of black lion-like creature which can kill you with a single blow (it can infect you with fever if you're lucky enough to survive the attack). It can be everywhere around the map, especially at night during which is almost invisible (this is a good feature indeed). Weapons like knives or rocks prove useless. This is another interesting point which makes gameplay less boring. But still devs had to put some sort of weapon with which you could stun it (for more than a handful of seconds) instead of running away with the thing right just behind you (both you and the creature are liable to some glitches like getting stuck between trees). In order to go ahead with the game you'll encounter it a lot. Same point as before: annoying and repetitive.\nThere are some intangible enemies like fever and thirst but they are easily manageable if you get the hang of the game.\n\nYou can say: "The game implies you're desperate to survive". But I think that if they added some sort of food & build (placing a small camp given the necessary tools and items) mechanics, or just giving more interactive features on the things you do as a habit, it would have been a really good game.\n\nIn short:\nI do not recommend this game to anyone who doesn't like doing the same stuff all the time. This game had the potential to be a good game indeed.\n\nThis is my review, now you are free to choose. I don't give Universal principles here and there so you do what you want.\n\nThanks for reading.\n","October 8, 2014","false","3.2"," 203 of 269 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","203","269","4","4"

There's almost nothing i would complain about in this game.\n\nTo start off, the concept is amazing and the execution is spot on. You are on an island, probably alone (yet to complete). And you are plague stricken for which you have to find a cure. The entire island is yours to explore. There are survival concepts such as thirst and fever. There is crafting and such with which you can make medicines and some perma-upgrades.\n\nNow, the three things i loved the most about this game. First, the mapping system. You have to explore the entire map but it's not that simple. You have to use triangular cartography by using landmarks which is just awesome. And when you run, it actually takes time to stop because of your momentum which i think is a great idea for a realistic survival game. And the graphics are amazing as well. Beautiful when admired and scary at night.\n\nThis game is amazing. I like it because of it's reality aspect.

It executes mapping and movement shockingly well, both concepts working in unison with the fundamental idea of player disempowerment.\n\nThe character trips, stumbles and gains momentum on an incline. Traversing the environment feels realistic within reason, and the quickest way to a point ahead is not always a straight line.\n\nCartography is tedious and the nature compelling enough that the player is likely to wander off the beaten path and fall into two possible scenarios: inside, safe or outside, lost. Loss of direction evokes glimpses of freedom rarely experienced in a video game.\n\nThe systems can be time-consuming to grasp and the solution to the mystery surrounding the player is scattered and abstruse.

Unlike other games that shoehorn survival elements in, or simply can't take the leap to make it pure survivalist, this indie game made by two brothers pulls it off.\n\nAnd how.\n\nIf you read the store page description of the game, you'd know that you are a plague stricken scientist, reuniting with your colleagues on an island.. but, as in any video game, something has gone horribly wrong.  You find a blood soaked page, which details the cure's formula.  And off you go..\n\nAs a pure survival game, there is no hunger mechanic, but there is thirst and fever.  Thirst naturally accumulates and you must rehydrate from clean water sources or canteens regularly.  Fever occurs from injury{falling from heights and getting scratched by a kittteh - more on Milo later} exertion (swimming, walking about), and ambiently, and you must take medicine that you craft from plants you find to offset it.  Or take a nap.\n\nYou see, throughout the game, and exploring the island, you can pick up various plants and take them to camps where equipment is located to refine it and synthesize various medicaments and drugs that you take.  These range from simple aspirin to drugs that permanently increase your physical attributes - as well as the cure, which you learn about from the Bloody note that you find from the beginning - detailing three agents each made from two rare plants.\n\nNavigating the island is a challenge - you have no arbitrary minimap and you must fill in a map using triangulation.  Which basically means that you must take your map out and get line of sight with two "known" landmarks to fill in an area - simply going there does not suffice...  You can also triangulate distant landmarks by triangulating your position as normal, and then selecting said landmark as a third - you must do this from two different positions.  They even give you a compass.\n\nThe actual mechanic of saving your game is quite interesting as well - you must sleep, select a candle, lantern, or put a log into a fire to save.\n\nOh, and the graphics are pretty too.  The island is beatiful and has many different environments, from swamps to boreal forests to a mountainous japanese style bamboo forest.  They managed to put all hud elements from the game into immersive 3d meshes - the journal is actually a 3d object that you turn 3d pages in and read text right off the texture.  The map is the same deal.\n\nNow, onto my favorite part of the game.  The creature.  Well, that and the notes you find that add backstory - but more on that later.\n\nThe creature is nicknamed Milo by the community, because it is based on the brothers' pet cat, MIlo.  Milo is a strange leopard-lion-elk thing that stalks you through your adventure.  He is very unique looking and can kill you with two swipes of his paws.  You must fend him off with a torch, throw rocks at him(Which may or may not just ♥♥♥♥ him off), or break line of sight to get him to go away.  You cannot fight back, and I wouldn't suggest running, as he'll catch up to your plague-ridden ♥♥♥♥ in seconds and anjoy a pre cooked meal, courtesy of fever.  His eminent presence can be detected through upgrades to your stats and a heartbeat sound that grows more rapid as he gets near.  Beware the Milo, for you cannot fight back.\n\nThe story is introduced through the notes you find in the camps throughout the game, ranging from journals, letters, and newspaper clippings, to your colleagues and your own's research notes.  I assure you, if you invest the time into collecting some of these you will not regret it.\n\nTo top it all off, the satisfying and inspiring ending and final cutscenes, as well as the musical tracks and environments make for such a great indie experience that I cannot recommend this enough for those that have the patience - and if you don't well there are decent guides out there.  And even then there remains the experience of exploring and avoiding Milo.","December 30, 2013","true","14.2"," 51 of 56 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","51","56","0","2"

In all my playtime I have yet to see "The Beast", although I know twice he's been near, which always adds a little tension.\n\nBut on more than one occasion I have found myself doing a perfect Nathan Drake "NO NO NO" as I lose my footing on a cliff and careen down the side, losing my precious herbs and axe along the way. Landing at the bottom of an unknown section of map, with a major fever.\n\nThis game has the most robust mapping system I have ever seen, relying on known waypoints and a compass to open your map, which you then use to triangulate your position, then adding the option to plot out unmarked waypoints, opening up more map. Make no mistake, if you don't like cartography or map-reading you will dislike this game. But, if you are into conquering nature while trying to map out a survival plan for yourself then this is the game for you. The mapping is the highlight of this game for me, it is fantastically implemented and should be the standard for any game going forward that uses a mechanic like building a map based on exploration.\n\nFocusing on exploration and narrative over scares and enemies, your wits are put to the test. Get stuck at night in the wilderness in a section that you have not mapped well and you'd better hope you run across a makeshift camp, or you're dead. yes, Nature is a formidable foe in this game.\n\nWith a beautiful island (which seems HUGE in scope), and a backstory from the early 1900's that plays out through scattered notes, there is an elusive mystery to uncover whilst acheiving the main game end-goal, which is to find 3 suitable plants that make a cure for the plague (which you are suffering from). With dozens of plants to find on the island you will find your eyesight put to the test as you watch for plants and man made objects to triangulate your map with, all the while keeping note of your surroundings for footing and dangers. Add in research stations that let you analyze your plants and then make different medicines with them, leading to buffs for your character to keep his health, endurance and sanity up and you're adding in hours of careful playtime.\n\nThe movement system is just as unique as the rest of this game. As a plague victim you are succumbing to the effects of the disease. Stay hydrated, stay feverless. The movement is based on a physics engine that reacts to the environment around you; climbing uphill dehydrated, you WILL know, you will feel the struggle. Going down a steep incline too fast? You will lose your footing, possibly sending you hundreds of feet downwards in a spiralling arc, hurting and disorienting you. Which could easily lead to a swift death. It's not perfect in it's execution, but it is something entirely different that really adds a unique aspect of challenge to the gameplay. Heavily wooded areas increase the chance of slipping on wet leaves. riverbeds are rocky, adding to the fall factor. Swamps get deep and there's always the chance of wading too deep, and if you're health isn't tended to, drowning becomes a real fear.\n\nI've hardly mentioned the Beast, as I have yet to encounter him. The Beast randomely patrols the island, the AI is based on sight, smell and sound. When he's stalking you, your heartbeat becomes your indicator. Hide or run, lose the Beast and you're alright...but if he continues to get closer you may have to fight him off, using weapons found around the Island, but I am told that fighting is for fools. Flee and stay hidden. I really don't mind that I have yet to come face-to-face with him. The Beast is almost as much about emotional fear than jump scares. But IMO, he is second to Nature as to the dangers around you.\n\nSaving relies on light. Fires, candles and lanterns populate the island, find one and light it and you have a saved game. A beautiful day/night cycle is active, with beds that allow you to sleep, save and skip a few hours ahead. Sticks can be used as torches at night to help in almost pitch-black wilderness, don't let The Beast see that light!\n\nI could go on and on about how much I enjoy this game, how great the community is; I could talk about the mods available that make it a more challenging and daunting survival sim. I could also tell you how much value I find in this game for only $15. But you should find out for yourself.\n\nIf you want a real survival challenge, that fiinally makes nature the main antagonist (while keeping the game exciting and challenging) then Miasmata is the game for you. The laerning curve is in the medium range of difficulty, but the community is always ready to help out, and there are plenty of guides to help you get started.\n\nHighly enjoyable, highly recommended. :)","July 25, 2014","true","16.9"," 52 of 58 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","52","58","0","0"

This is not a game for everyone.\n\nMiasmata is one of those modern indie games that, in my opinion, is striving to be an artsy like experience than what is traditionally considered a game by the average joe. And just like those games with similar aspirations, the gameplay is diminshed so the player can be wowed by the "experience".\n\nAnd that's why I was on the fence when deciding to recommend this because I couldn't help but feel that this game could've been grander if the developers spent more time on the gameplay aspect. However, it's hard to overlook what effort they did put in the environment/sound effects and I think it paid off.\n\nMiasmata is beautiful to explore. Realistic looking and massive in size along with its varied topography, it's almost like hiking in a national park.  But, it has a dark character and history to it as well that will become apparent if you decide to play it.\n\nI only recommend this game to those who love exploring natural, beautious environments (and finding flowers for a cure) because that's what 90 percent of this game is.

If you're not holding anything, then you pull out your lighter at night to view the map. But if you're holding anything before pulling it out (including a torch) the map ends up being a useless black square in the dark. Requiring you to drop your torch and have it roll away every time you want to look at the map.\nWeapons. Why give me knives/axes if they're completely useless?\nThe "Creature". I played this game for 5 hours and only saw the "creature" once. It found me when I was out in the open and had nowhere to hide, so I just kept watching it while walking backwards towards the closest hut. It never attacked me, just followed a few feet away the enire time. Once I reached the hut it wandered off, never to be seen again.\n\nThe bad.\nYour character controls like a 400 pound blob wearing bowling shoes. Once you get the slightest bit of momentum going, it's really hard to stop. This had me constantly running off cliffs and falling down hills that I should've been able to stop infront of. Any slight incline and you will either start sliding or just start running down it. This makes exploring extremely frustrating at times.\n\nWhile I have stopped playing out of frustration, I may pick it up again at a later date to see if they've updated it at all. I really do love the idea of this game, and could probably have forgiven a majority of the flaws, but the controls ruined the experience for me. They drove me absolutely insane and were the sole reason I stopped playing the game. It's unfortunate, but I just can't reccomend this game because of the controls.","November 25, 2013","false","5.1"," 212 of 312 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","212","312","0","6"

What sets this game apart from other open world games is how important the mechanics are when it comes to navigation and shelter. You really have to learn how to map out areas by using landmarks to avoid being lost.  You want to be able to also make medicine in case you stumble and fall and end up with a fever.\n\nPhysics Create Consequence\nThere is actual consequences for not watching your balance thanks to the physics in this game. It really feels like you are a vulnerable person on a island trying to find a cure and any misstep can lead to to plunge right off a cliff if you don’t slow down enough.\n\nAI is Unpredictable\nThe AI is also less predictable when making his presence known since he does not get scripted to certain triggers but rather roams around the island.  This actually adds more suspense when you compare it to games like Amensia because the confrontation with the beast is not obvious and can happen at any time.\n\nGathering\nGathering plants allows you to craft various potions that reward you with stat increases or help reduce fever, resulting in a rewarding experience when exploring the island .The storage system for the plants makes it easier to go from one place to the next without worrying about how much room you have left.\n\nIssues and Conclusion\nI have had some graphical issues that I am currently working on fixing but other than that I would say the game is very enjoyable.","December 4, 2013","true","20.6"," 44 of 49 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","44","49","0","0"

You are defenseless, but there's nothing really to kill you except for your own mind. The concept behind this game is amazing and the AI for the monster is one of the best I've ever seen. I've read it was supposed to be based on the dev's cat and I can totally see that. It behaves just like a real life cat would, and if you treat it thusly you can generally escape it.\n\nThis game was a very well rounded game in my opinion and once I started playing it I couldn't stop until I was finished. I completed the game in two days I think. Not only is it an incredibly unique and interesting idea, the execution was great as well. The visuals, and most importantly the flowers, were stunning and I could tell a lot of them were modelled after real flowers. The story line which you garner from notes left by people before was intriguing and chilling. The behavior of the monster just blew me away. The heartbeat noise alone was enough to get my own heart pounding. I could tell the dev put a TON of effort into thinking out the monster which I must applaud.\n\nAt first I disliked the triangulating your position aspect of the map, but after a while I came to like and respect it as an idea. Also I liked that it wasn't as hard as just wandering through the jungle, aimlessly and that you were actually pointed in the right direction gently. The size of the map and the details within the terrain were very well done.\n\nI practically have nothing but praise for this game. I think one of my biggest... dislikes? Was that when you died you were merely sent back to your last save point. So there was really no threat.\n\nAnywho, I would definitely recommend this game.\n\nProbably one of the most memorable games I've ever played.","June 21, 2014","true","23.5"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","36","42","0","1"

With deep I mean there are a lot of notes scattered around the island that can give a greater depth to the story, if you care to read them.\nYou are a scientist, stricken by plague and on hunt for a cure. You are washed up on a mysterious island, Eden. Eden is home to the plants and fungi that are nevessary ingredients of the sought-after cure. On this island you find yourself alone, with empty camps and a few dead bodies around the island. Or are you really alone?\n\n== Gameplay ==\nMiasmata is a free roaming exploration-centered survival-game. It is free roaming and exploration-centered as you are dropped on a mysterious island with no clear objectives. You must find your own way around the island, and exploring it is very much a part of doing so.\nIt doesn't have a very heavy emphasis on the "survival"-part, as the only things you must do in order to stay alive is drink water, stay out of deep water and not fall off cliffs or slip into the hands of a hungry creature.\nMost of the gameplay boils down to five things:\n- Trying to triangulate your position and reveal new portions of the (fairly large) map.\n- Picking flowers\n- Drinking water\n- Trying to navigate up or down a steep hill\n- Running (as means of travel or trying to avoid a threat)\nThat being said, it may sound very basic and boring. Well IT IS NOT. I found it very satisfying to explore the map, trying to find a new camp or new objects I can triangulate. Once I found a new camp I got a tickly feeling in my entire body. Finding a new flowers and bringing it back to the base while hoping that it is of some use to you gives you a feeling that other games rarely can give.\n\n== Graphics ==\nMiasmata is made by a two-man team and the engine that powers the game is made by just the two of them. With this in mind, Miasmata could be a worse-looking game. Sure, it doesn't look like an AAA-title like Battlefield, and the animations are a bit wonky. But what do you expect?\nIt does succeed in giving the game a very cozy and atmospheric feeling, which is core in a game like this. Never did I once during the game (except for maybe the first minutes) feel that "This game could really use some better graphics".\n\n== Summary ==\nMiasmata may have some weird movement from time to time, the graphics aren't the best, and you would hope that a scientist could carry more than three flowers at the same time.\nBut what it lacks in those parts, and some other parts aswell, it makes more than well up for in the other parts. Exploration is fun and extremly satisfying, especially when you find a new camp that has important notes or when you find a new fungi that is part of the cure. Triangulating your position in order to reveal parts of the map is hard but rewarding, something that many games are missing.\nWhat made me buy this game at first I don't really know. What kept me playing was pretty much everything in the game. Do I recommend this game? Yes, I do.","August 7, 2013","true","14.1"," 43 of 55 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","43","55","0","2"

Majority of the time is spent just exploring with no fear of danger leaving you to plot and map out the island as you go. The mechanics for taking notes on landmarks you see and using them to get your bearings around the island to fill out the map more is great fun and very rewarding. It is quite unique and I have never seen it in a game before. By using buildings, statues, and stone formations you can use triangulation to check your location and add your surroundings to the map you create.\n\nThe creature that roams the island can be a positive or a negative for many people whether they are looking for some slight horror and suspense of hiding from it, or if they just don't want to be bothered by it. The creature isn't a constant threat and holds a good balance to appease either type of player. When the creature draws near your heart pounds and you do your best to stay hidden and hope it passes.\n\nThe game works very well with exploration and filling out the log book and looking for specific plants to be used in antidotes and medicines help drive you to explore more. Though you will want to keep exploration to the days as much as possible making your way to camps to rest through the night. The night time is extremely dark and after losing track of time and getting stranded in the middle of the night you will never want to be left out again stumbling through the darkness hardly able to see what lies ahead.\n\nIf you enjoy the slower pace and exploration which you most likely do if you care enough to look at reviews and recommendations about the game then you won't be disappointed. This game draws you into the world and makes you want to spend time in it seeing what lies just over the next crest.","March 17, 2014","true","12.1"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","26","28","0","0"

You have to wander through the forests, spot and collect plants, then carry them back to somewhere you can identify them and their effects.\nYou are also chased by "something" during all this, but I won't tell more about it here ;)\n\nWhat makes the essence of that game is the Cartography Mechanic. Basically, you'll have to build your map on your own, not to get lost. To reveal the map, you have to stand at a particular spot and aim with your compass to 2 known objects (houses / statues / ruins) that you know, so you'll be able to triangulate your position and reveal the map.\nThen, the "how to get in the forest without being lost" will make your brain cells works.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, every tree has been "hand-placed" by the two developpers (they have made the entire game, including the physics engine, on their own... that's incredible).\n\n[Pros] :\n\n+ Awesome graphics, really (but don't hope playing with a low-end GC), better than some AAA Games\n+ The feeling of being "lost" on that Island ; this is the sole game where I really had the feeling that I was lost xD\n+ A real "exploration game", where you're thrown in and don't know what to do at first\n+ The Cartography mechanics, quite unique if you like it.

Trust me. I did learn something cool about the monster and it's what made me buy the game. The monster doesn't just appear when you go to a certain place (Sometimes he does but thats only in places where theres something to do with the cure there (don't quote me on that)) he actually is always moving and when your in your lab making some science shizzles he's out there following your trail and looking for you... He's not just going to appear when you go somewhere, he appears whenever he has tracked you down! The starting area is safe but once you cross that line the beast will GET YOU!!!!

One, actually moving around is awful as it feels like you're controlling a drunk person and not a diseased plague patient. I had too many occasions where I went from calmly walking down a hill to the beach and quickly progressed to rolling headfirst down the hill into the water, killing the pc. Secondly, the game is just so freaking boring. Once the initial fifteen minutes are up and you really look at this game, there's not a whole lot to it. You go from one campsite to the next, getting lost while holding flowers, and keeping an eye out for The Beast. When you first spawn, you'll be a bit wary of the enemy until you realize that you'll rarely (if ever) encounter it and evading it isn't very difficult. Out of the many playthroughs I've had, I only ran into The Beast once and all I did was wave a handfull of burning sticks at it and it ran away. I am a bit dissapointed because there's definitely potential here, but the lack of a general story, present threat, and weird gameplay bog the whole thing down. It's unfortunate that these reasons are enough to make me uninstall this game from my computer and move on to other games worth my time.","January 11, 2015","false","6.6"," 50 of 72 people (69%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","69","50","72","7","0"

The fever makes everything blurry and you're really weak as well and you can die from drowning and fatigue which is really exciting because I can empathise with the main character.

Miasmata is an almost perfect masterpiece.\n\nMiasmata is a first-person exploration game that caters strongly to the survival simulation player. It really is unlike just about any other game of its type that it's difficult to pinpoint just what genre it belongs to. Miasmata involves a variety of mechanics including cartography, botany, orienteering,  exploration of a very large island, and includes a dash of survival horror that will keep the player on edge. It's an incredible collation of components that creates an fantastic atmosphere. Players will be torn between feelings of isolation and solitude, followed by moments of achievement and accomplishment, and on many occasions dread and a sense of helplessness.\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of Miasmata is the complete freedom the player is given to explore the island. You are truly free to go anywhere, at any time. You are given a journal with the most basic goals of the game, some guidelines to follow, and off you go. I truly love that type of design, it shows trust and respect the devlopers have for their player base. And, considering that the game was developed by two brothers, and has such an incredible attention to detail that it's obviou this was a passion project for the two of them. The day and night cycle, shifting weather conditions, along with the shading and textures create such a living and vivid atmosphere that you can practically feel the sun on your skin. There are animals playing in the underbrush, birds singing in the trees and flying around the player, a huge variance in biomes, and very realistically detailed light conditions; the island feels very real.\n\nThe story is purposefully revealed slowly through letters, journals, and diary pages found in various shelters throughout the island. Even when collecting them the players are allowed to piece together their view and interpretation of what brought the player's character to this island, and what will happen if they eventually leave. The narrative is so tight and interesting that it seems that, even though I had complete freedom to explore at my leisure, it was as if the story was presented to me in a discernible order. I should also note that I appreciate a level of ambiguity in certain types of stories and Miasmata delivers on that front as well.\n\nWhat Miasmata is not is easy, or forgiving.\n\nThe first time you experience night on the island, truly experience night, when the only light source you have is the inadequate lighter in your hand, with no visible landmarks, and no sense of which way you need to go, you will experience a feeling of helplessness that is just as real as actually being lost at night. As someone who has been in that terrible situation in real life this game gets very close to imitating that subtle creep of frustration, fear, and agony as you slowly realize your error. Very often the best solution is to bed down for the night and continue in the morning. Coming across a shelter after having trekked for an extended period of time, while running low on water, suffering weakness from the plague, and with the setting sun preparing to blanket the island in a curtain of night, is one of the greatest feelings and most rewarding senses of accomplishment I've had the privelege of experiencing in a game.\n\nIn addition to the difficulty of navigating at night, negotiating the topography of the island is very often difficult in itself. This isn't the typical third-person physics engine in which the player can catapault themselves recklessly through forest, over hills, and atop mountains. If the player isn't careful or intelligent on how they navigate the terrain they can fall and injure themselves which will need to be addressed with medicine and/or rest. There is even an often frustrating sliding mechanic that, if ignored, can lead the player to some grossly terrible and very sudden falls. I both hate, and love this mechanic as it is equal parts frustrating and realistic. When it rains it even gets more dangerous to navigate steep areas, especially in the mud. I can understand people viewing this as a frustrating negative, I agree that it can be frustrating, but the character is suffering from a disease that weakens his body, when combined with the actual difficulty of navigating varied and difficult terrain, heightens the believability and realism of the game, elevating it to a very thoughtful experience that punishes recklessness, and rewards careful planning.\n\nTo top off all this incredible programming for the island itself you have 'the creature' which looks like a cross between a wildebeest, a mountain lion, and a chameleon. The first time it showed up was one of the best scares I've experienced in a while. My character's heart started beating and I wasn't sure why. I assumed it had something to do with the beast so I knelt in the grass and frantically looked around for it. Frustratingly I couldn't locate but could hear rustling in the underbrush as it crept closer, and closer. I made a sudden turn to my left before running and found myself staring directly into the eyes of the stalking panther-like beast. Luckily I was close to a shelter though I managed to slip and fall down a hillside, injuring myself, as I ran away like one of the Three Stooges. The beast stalks the island, and you're never safe if you're outside shelter, even at night. Especially at night. The creature adds just the perfect level of tension, weirdness, and horror to the game to make it a truly memorable and unique experience.\n\nThe only areas of frustration with the game are the fact that there are bugs and parts that don't seem quite finished. When using the map at night, specifically when you are holding a lit torch, you can see nothing but a completely black screen which makes night time navigation practically impossible though, when you are only using a lighter you can see the map just fine. Carrying objects can be frustrating as you can only ever carry one of each type of item at a time, which makes collecting plants for basic medicine a bit repetitive. There's also the frustration of sliding around on the hills. While it can be a tremendous source of frustration I enjoy it's realism and enjoy the challenge though I recognize that it would be a major source of difficulty for some players. Highest commendations to a steam user by the name of DarkStarSword who has practically taken the game under his wing and has patched up several issues, eliminated many bugs, and improved the achievement progress. You can find his unofficial patch here:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/223510/discussions/0/648812916771880184/\n\nMy experience with Miasmata was superb. I've taken more screenshots of this game than any other in my library. I enjoyed every morning waking up in a new and unexplored section of the island, planning the day around what areas I needed to map and navigate, finding previously unknown shelters in all corners of the island, reading the notes and journal entries to discover the lore of this world, being caught in afternoon rain storms while triangulating my position, watching the sun set slowly in the distance as the calls of loons surround me, hearing my character's heartbeat hasten as I pushed deeper inland looking for new plants knowing the creature was close, and stumbling across a new shelter as night was falling, have encompassed a solid gaming experience that will be hard to duplicate.\n\nI give Miasmata my highest recommendations, especially for those that love a good survival, and exploration gaming experience.","March 9","true","34.2"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

The point of this game is to find 6 plants, make a cure and get off the island while avoiding "The Creature". Now this island is HUGE and you'll need to use the unique mapping system to find your way around or you'll be stupid lost. Once I got a hang of how you unlock the map it was alot of fun and felt very realistic. Character movement was something I also give a high score for. Running down a steep hill will most like end up as you sommersaulting down it instead and whatever you where carring to go flying. I also enjoyed all the different biomes. There are quite a few and each one is very impressive due to the wildlife sounds, critters running about and the huge sizes for tress and plants. Did i mention there are ants moving on the ground? My point is A LOT of little details went into making this game and for that i give this game a thumbs up!\n\nA bit of a downside for this game for me would have to be the story and threat from "The Creature". There are notes around the island that give some story but I felt they were a bit lacking. At the start of the game you get alot of story hints about whats going on around the island then they just dry up around half way through the game. It took me 12 hours to finish this game and for the first 8 hours I never once saw the creature. So it was just me wandering through the woods picking flowers and making my map. Yep slow and boring for most I think. Then near the end "The Creature" must have sensed I almost had my cure and was stalking me every 5 mins!

The point of the game appears to be nothing more then running around the island looking for flowers to create ever more potent medicines from. You don't eat, you don't build, you don't encounter but one beast type and you do nothing but sleep, drink water, collect plants, make meds and take them when necessary. This game takes place within a nicely done 3D world but the game play lacks any depth. I was bored within the first 30 min but continued, hoping there was more to this then I had already discovered - there wasn't.  I also find the physics very annoying i.e. the inertia. As your character approaches a steep incline, he can't seem to put on the brakes before he goes over the edge. It just feels clumsy. While the notebook is a neat idea for a GUI, I found it to be a tedious way to get to the info you are looking for. After watching the research and crafting animations a dozen times, you will be looking for a way to skip them - to no avail.  As I said the game has potential but is severely lacking in depth. If running around an island collecting flowers (while running from a singular beastie) sounds fun then perhaps you will enjoy this game. If you need a game with more then a singular goal you should look elsewhere.","August 7, 2014","false","4.0"," 28 of 41 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","28","41","0","2"

Many times I have been walking down or around a hill or cliff, suddenly the character speeds forward and ends up falling to the ground, and this have some severe consequences towards your avarage health, in general, whenever the guy get enough speed, you will fall and get hurt.\n\nIn conclusion, a wonderfull game and you should be buying it, unless you're some action fan and likes things to happen oftenly, in this case, the game may not be to your liking, since it's all about patience and observation.","October 29, 2015","true","13.8"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","16","20","2","0"

Initially, this came across as a tedious and boring - I wasn't crazy about the game after spending thirty minutes in it, so I put it down and played other games.\n\nEventually, I came back to give it another try.\n\nAfter 9.1 hours of play, I can safely say that this game surprised me, and I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. Exploring the island in search of remedies for Robert Hughes' ailments was astonishingly fun and rewarding; although, this game remains one that had room for improvement.\n\nPros:\n\n- Fantastic exploration\n- Learning curve that makes succeeding that much more rewarding\n- Beautiful environment (most of the time)\n- Unexpectedly strong sense of isolation and survival\n- Very realistic\n- Beautiful music (during the few instances that you are able to hear it)\n- Touching plot\n- Being stalked by the creature was actually terrifying\n\nCons:\n\n- Very awkward animations\n- Bizarre physics when falling down hills (falling down hills is not advised)\n- Lack of sound effects during synthesis\n- Pretty buggy (the two devs acknowledged that after five years developing Miasmata, they were exhausted and stopped fixing bugs)\n- Some mechanics may only be learned the hard way (either never explained or poorly explained)\n\nAll in all, I will reiterate that I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Miasmata. I needed some time to warm up to it, but once I gave it that luxury, I became immersed in the world and my surroundings. The astonishing sense of isolation and survival kept me on my toes and kept me efficient throughout my in-game experience.

The monster is a nice touch and added a creepy aspect\n\nCons:\n1. Running momentum was a little obnoxious. (Can be tuned with a mod which can be found in the Miasmata discussions)\n2. The falling animation is annoying. (First time I fell from a small ledge down maybe 3 feet it played the tumbling animation. I thought I was glitching because I just kept turning. In the end, I found it a little unnecessary, especially from that short of height.)\n3. Cartography was also kind of annoying\n4. The slow paced exploration isnt really my style.\n\nThis game is pretty cool overall. I personally like the game but not enough to merit lots of hours of gameplay from me. I recommend it because, despite the annoyances, I didn't feel it fair to give it the old "thumbs down."

I have been following this game for quite a while, and now I can finally say I own it. Created by just two people from IonFX, the game does deliver on what it is set out to be. It is not a horror game, it is a survival exploration game where you explore an island, known only to you as Eden\n\nYou play Robert Hughes, a man who was exiled and is stricken with plague. You have to find three agents; Agent X, Agent Y and Agent Z to form the cure to cure your strickened fever. You have to travel across the huge map of Eden and find specific plants and fungi to form the basic components to make the cure. However, you are not alone. There is a creature that is watching you and hunting you down in the deep dense forests of the dangerous island of Eden\n\nOverall, the game is fantastic. The game does not hold you're hand at all. No checkpoints, no objectives, nothing. It just throws you in and you have to discover what the island holds yourself. Although the game's graphics aren't the best, they do deliver and you can play this game on any piece of modern hardware\n\nAlthough frequent pop ups of the environment do ruin a bit the feel for the game, the game's graphics deliver. The music, what little there is, is very good and fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the game. However, the game heavily relies on sound effects and yes, the game does deliver this perfectly. If you want a true experience, play the game with headphones\n\nAs said before, the game does not hold your hand. You have to discover the island for yourself, hence, the game can get boring and sometimes too difficult as the map system, which uses cartography, is a bit annoying and frustrating, especially when it comes to unknown locations. If you hadn't updated your map or found letters and documents that update you're map, then you will be a sitting duck and lost completely. Although the game does offer a compass to help, which in some cases, it does. Sometimes, you will just be lost for hours. For me personally to find the closest campsite without the use of the map, it took me roughly an hour. The map is huge for this game\n\nThe gameplay, although simple, all you have to do is explore the island and collect plants and fungi which then get added to your journal. Once you've found a campsite which has an experimentation table, you can experiment with the collected items to form basic or advanced medicine or agents for the cure\n\nAs mentioned previously, the main protagonist, Robert is stricken with plague and fever. Hence, he isn't that strong, and though I appreciate the people at IonFX for making it realistic, it does get quite annoying. When you run too much, he breathes too heavily which in turn can get annoying and can be a lure for the creature. You can't climb that high, hence he falls back when its too high, again, annoying and can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ when trying to run away from the creature and he falls too suddenly making you go into a fall animation which spins the camera like nobody's business making you lose the items you had, which in turn is annoying and a pain when trying to run away from the blasted creature. Also, you can only swim a certain amount, otherwise, thanks to his plague infested body, he will start to drown and die. Very annoying\n\nThe creature, what a wonderful yet terrifying creature. The creature roams the island in search for you and will hunt you down. The only way you can avoid the creature is either by hiding or by distracting it. You cannot outrun it, its quicker than you and with the annoyance of your bloody plague, you can't get too far. The creature is scary and makes your heart pump a few times when you encounter it. But, the more and more you encounter it, especially when you have the last few ingredients of the cure, the more and more, the creature becomes annoying and a chore to find a place and hide. Don't get me wrong, the creature was a brilliant addition to the game, but good god can it get boring and frustrating. At first, before you find a specific drug, the only way you will only be notified if the creature is nearby is by the beating sound of Robert's heart. The stronger it gets, the closer the creature is\n\nOnce you have found a specific drug, the game will provide you with an indicator whilst crouched which will show a HUD system in which when white, the creature can't see you and red when it can see you. The stealth mechanic is okay, but not the best. Sometimes, when you're hiding and the HUD system says you're okay, the creaure can still see you and sometimes when the creature is really close to you and you can tell that it's seeing you, it ignores you completely. Also sometimes, the HUD system and sound effect did not work which made it even more frustrating\n\nIf you die by, fever, dehydration, drowning or killed by the creature. If you haven't recently saved, you're stuck. There is no quick save functionality and no checkpoints, the only way you can save is either by lighting a candle or lamp, or by sleeping which saves the game and these can only be found in campsites\n\nThe game does offer a day and night cycle as well as a weather system, great additions to the game. However, at night, if you do not have a source of light, good luck looking where you are going as the night becomes pitch black and very scary. Robert only seems to drink water, no food, which does lose a bit of the realism\n\nThe game is fantastic, but is plagued with bugs, glitches and crashes. The amount of times the game crashed on me, I just wanted to give up. Sometimes during the menu, sometimes while playing. The game would just simply crash. Bugs and glitches too are annoying, sometimes Robert would get stuck on the environment as well as other minor bugs\n\nI wish the game would have fixed these issues. Also, the game does encounter some stuttering when trying to load some music or a piece of the environment, even sometimes crashing the game in the process...\n\nMiasmata is a fantastic game and a true indie gem, if only IonFX would have fixed some of the problems that the game had and gave some help to its player base, then this game would of been ten times better than what it is. But as it stands, the story is interesting, the graphics are good, music and sound effects well produced. Miasmata is one of those games you should pick, even if it is just for a couple of hours!\n\nRECOMMENDED :)  THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY!

This game has the best simulation of a natural environment that I have ever felt.  You have no HUD, instead having to rely on paying attention to visual and audio cues from your character and your journal.\nI spent 23 hours on my first playthrough just living in the world, trying to map out the island, and trying to collect all the plants on the island.  In those 23 hours, I was never bored and was frequently on the edge of my seat.  Speaking of mapping, that is one of my favourite things about the game.  Once you understand how it works, it becomes a game in itself.  If you are the obsessive compulsive type, you will love travelling all over the island to get every spot mapped out.\nYour goal in the game is to discover a cure for a plague that you and the outside world are stricken with.  You do this by researching plants and finding clues scattered over the island.  But really, I just had fun being on the island, it is an incredible simulation.  Even the clouds are amazing, you could just sit there watching them go by and trying to see pictures in them.\nI should probably mention the controls.  Some have said that your character moves like he's on ice skates and slides around everywhere.  I didn't have a problem with this, your character is sick and not some olympic athlete like in every other game out there.  Falling down a hill can be one of the most dangerous things in this game and I think that is a good thing.  You really are a normal person suffering from a sickness and you are always vulnerable in this game.\nThis is a fairly slow paced game that requires you to pay attention to your character and surroundings in a different way than any other and I think that makes it well worth playing.\nOh, and make sure you download the community patch, I didn't play without it but it sounds like it makes a huge difference.  I experienced a couple of crashes even with the community patch but they weren't a big deal.","April 7","true","26.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

No big deal really because they don't seem to be of any use bsides waving around when the bunyip monkey monster comes around. You can't actually attack anthing.\nThe biggest let downs IMO is the issues with the day night cycles and the so called mapping.\nBoth these things in particular turn a slow paced novel game into a boring frustrating slow paced game.\nIt seems to be night for a far greater time than day, and in the dark you are literally in total blackness. Even using torches etc are near useless so the only thing you can do is wait. And wait and wait and wait, until daylight slowly comes.  Even during the day, it can all of a sudden become near total darkness because its getting cloudy, or its an eclipse or whatever reason.\nAt night you occasionaly run into the bunyip monkey monster that come at you, sends your heart rate faster and faster and most of the time you just run and hope! I\nget the feeling this "monster" was put in as a last minute item to try and add some sense of fear. You can't seem to kill it or anything and seems out of place, especially considering theres no other living creatures besides some bugs and birds in the distance.\nThe mapping system is the second let down.  its a good idea where you need to triangulate points from known landmarks etc but is a long, tedious and frustrating affair. 90 percent of the game is simply trying to work out where you are and where your going. Trying to make a map, 1 small section at a time.\nThe game isn't all bad as such, but is definitely not suited for everybody.\nI quite enjoyed it at the start and the collection of plants etc to make medicine etc is a neat idea. Unfortunately that is all it has. Besides drinking, and taking medicine, then thats it for gneral survival. You don't have to eat, or hunt, or build shelters.  Even sleep is just a way to speed through the night if your lucky enough to be near a bed when night falls, and to save your game.\nIts the sort of game where every now and then I'll probably have a bit of a tinker with it, but its definately not the sort of game I'd recomend to anyone looking for thrills, excitement and adventure etc.","October 13, 2014","false","13.7"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","23","39","0","0"

But when I finally did buy it... It completely blew my mind.\n\nMiasmata is one of my favorite indie games of all time and shows that you can make a different game with a low budget without vomiting some "philosophical" nonsense on it to make it seem legit. The game is ridiculously atmospheric and immersive and it completely sucks you in. The only "downside" is that it's a one time experience. Once you finish the game, even if you're into achievements hunting, there isn't much to return to. The appeal of the game is exploration and once the island is explored, well, yeah.

The looks, your movements, the sounds, the story and the mechanics all work together to make this an interesting and immersive experience. You feel that the character, you, isn't doing well, that you're often exhausted and have to fight both the exotic environment as well as your illness. You huff and puff at any exertion, thirst and untreated fevers impair your vision and coordination, falls will often disorient you and even finding out just where you are is something of a chore. Day-to-day survival is work here, giving you a sense of vulnerability, compounded by the fear of the Creature.\nI'll give each of these a closer look below.\n\nLooks\nThis is a very good-looking game, most of the time. There are a few graphic oddnesses, like the arms and hands that, while important and immersive can't help looking a little awkward at times. Texture pop-in and the sometimes very 'grainy' water are easily forgivable sins, seeing that most everything else works very well. Special mention should be made of the day and night cycle. Not only do dawns and sunsets look fantastic, as do the rays of sunlight filtered through the trees, they also actually work. Looking toward a brighter light, like the sun or a torch, will make dark areas even darker and more difficult to navigate. Nights are very dark indeed, there being nothing more than the moon and stars to light your way. Your lighter is a decent emergency light and burning twigs or a torch will properly light up your immediate area, helping you find your way to some sort of shelter.\n\nMovement\nI suspect that many will find moving around in this game to be an awkward business, much unlike the fluid movements in other First Person games. Moving forwards is generally fine but try any looking-left-while-strafing-right to look around while moving or a very quick turn and you're in for a surprise. It would seem that Robert can't run sideways as fast as he can run forwards. This shouldn't be the shock it is, since most people can't. You also have momentum to contend with - running downhill can be a very bad idea and may easily run you right over a ledge into a nasty fall. Climbing hills is a slow to laborious process which is further influenced by your current state. Thirst and fever will make you weaker and slower, making progress more difficult.\nIf all this sounds awkward and off-putting, you can rest assured that there are good and design-conscious reasons behind every seeming impediment.\n\nSound\nThe soundscape of Miasmata is fairly minimal but well implemented. There are near-constant ambient noises, such as wind, rustles, trickling or rushing water, bird-calls, crashing waves or rain, but next to no score. There's music in the game, to be sure, but it's held back to mark certain locations or the odd special moment.  Your footfalls have their own sounds, in keeping with whatever surface you're on, which is a nice touch. Loose rocks and crackling twigs could have a few more samples though, being a bit repetetive.\n\nMechanics\n\nA brief look at some of the different ways things are done in the game.\nMedicines are "synthesized" in the labs around the Island, using one or two plants for each new type. Each plant first has to be found and examined. How to do this is clearly explained in the first few notes you find and works well. The process does get repetetive but the animations can be interrupted. A few more different animations would be nice to have. Notes scattered around the island will tell you where to look for crucial elements and thus give you a good incentive to travel all over the place.\n\nCartography is a large and important feature in the game. You have precious little idea of where you are, most of the time, since you have to 'draw' the map on your own. This is accomplished by triangulating your current position, using your compass and known landmarks. Distant and unknown landmarks can be triangulated by moving between two known positions and marking them on the map. Much like in real life. Well implemented, with a chance of a minor 'exploit' as a handy shortcut.\n\nTime does flow here, as shown by your watch and the well made day/night-cycle. This gives you a sense of urgency, since being caught out after dark has the very real consequense of easily losing your way to that shelter and bed. Unfortunately, the sense of urgency is diminished by the fact that you don't see a definite progression of your illness, that you can stay alive on water and medicine indefinitely.\n\nThe Creature is a somewhat mysterious and certainly threatening presence on the island. It can turn up at nearly any time and will likely send chills down your spine as you hear the sudden thump of your own heartbeat, reminding you of your precarious situation. There are techniques and medicinal boosts that can help you avoid being found, which is a good thing, seeing as you're in no shape to fight this beast. Well done, overall, but it does occasionally get stuck in a loop, which can be annoying.\n\nStory\nI intentionally left this for last, since it's in the manual and of litte importance. When starting the game, you're placed in the shoes of Robert Hughes, a plague-stricken scientist, stranded on an unknown island, in search of a cure. Precisely why a name is mentioned is something of a mystery, since the who of you is of utter insignificance to anything that happens in the game. (Here the developers missed a chance to involve female players a little more.) The more imortant words are 'stranded', made evident by your bloody hands and the wrecked boat beside you and 'plague-stricken', as you'll notice shortly.\n\nFever, thirst, brutally murdered scientists, mysterious messages, baffling notes, helpful discoveries, rain, darkness, swamps, glorious sunsets, coluorful fungi and more plants than you can shake a burning twig at will help and hinder and baffle you on your journey.\n\nYour goal, ultimately, is to find the cure and escape this island. The cure is to be found among the rich flora of the island, which you will research, annotate and cook up various medicines from. Some will just be a temporary stay of your recurring fevers and some will give you more lasting effects. To help your progress, you'll find the notes of the expedition scattered around in their huts and tents.\n\nEscaping the island, alive, will not be easy.\n\nThere are some missed opportunities for exposition and deepening the story, such as conspiracies or cover-ups that are just hinted at, the obvious mystery of the murders which could be better developed and the odd and disconcerting Creature.\n\nRecommendation\nAll in all, I found this to be a very rewarding exerience. I thoroughly enjoyed the lush environments of the island, the often beautiful vistas opening up in front of me as I clear the crest of a hill, the deep dark of the nights and the heart-pounding fear of being found by the Creature. I even liked the work of mapping my progress around the island, since it added both realism and a feeling of accomplishment set against the helplessness of being lost.\n\nKudos and a hearty 'Well done!' to the brothers of IonFX.","January 5, 2014","true","22.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

To find this cure you have to find plants and create potions, while triangulating landmarks to create your own map of the island.\n\nThe island is huge and you're free to go wherever you want, as long as you can keep yourself alive. You have to be careful that you don't dehydrate, drown, get killed by a creature (I haven't encountered it myself yet) or that you take your medicine in time.\n\nThe game is played from a first person perspective, which actually works quite alright, but walking and running (and especially stopping/slowing down) can be awkward and clumsy. It tries to be realistic by slowing down your character when climbing up the hills or speeding up when you're heading downwards. Most of the times it seems random and I've lost count of how many times I've fallen.\n\nYou're also allowed to carry a maximum of 3 different plants at the same time, and you can't carry more than one of the same plant. So most of the times you have to make multiple trips. However, there are cabins scattered across the island. These cabins allow you to transfer your plants between any of them, which helps, but limiting the amount of plants you can carry is still a bit frustrating. On the other hand, it does create a certain tension so I guess there's something to be said for it. Especially traveling when it's dark is not recommended, because it can get pitchblack without any torches. And then there's this creature I keep hearing about...\n\nSo, I'm having some mixed emotions here. I guess I shall be taking my journal and compass, and enter the world once more to see if my opinion changes for the better... or for the worse.\n\n[Rating: 73/100]","February 3, 2013","true","2.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Worth it just to get lost in it.\n-Once you get used to movement, it actually becomes an extra challenge just to move up and down slopes. Its quite fun!\n-I would get giddy with excitement whenever I'd discover a new plant and would hurry back to the lab to check it out!\n-Tons of different drugs to craft and use\n-The creature won't appear often, but when the character's heart starts pumping, yours will too!\n-The creature acts in a believable way! There are several different ways to deal with it... some ending with your death.\n-After trekking in the wilderness, you truly get a feeling of satisfaction when you discover an outpost.\n-You are completely free to explore at your leasure in any direction. The island is also massive!\n-The cartography system is awesome. Later in the game I had a lot of fun mapping out the entire island.\n-When night falls it gets very dark... which is very scary. Add to it the monster on the prowl and you have a bit of horror.\n\nCons\n-Character is a bit too prone to falling and tripping down slight hills. It gets annoying/frustrating.\n-Some areas won't be of much use later on -  more quantity over quality (vast areas with just trees, useless ruins, etc)\n-Ruins are a bit of a dissapointment : there are no secrets nor lore to it. Who built them? You won't know.\n-There is a bit of a tease with ''Psychotic episodes'' and ''hallucinations'' being mentioned in a paper, but it doesn't happen. If you let the fever worsen you just die.\n-Survival is unrealistically easy - no need to hunt nor eat, and resting in a shoddy cot in a tent will cure you of heavy fever. Taking pills also instantly makes you better. I kinda wish it worked like that IRL.\n-The ending is pretty sad and disappointing. Didn't feel like my efforts payed off.\n\nAll in all, I'd say the pro far outweigh the cons. It is very impressive that two guys made this game from scratch!\n\nIf you like exploration, discovery, ambiance, science with only a little bit of scare, then you will really enjoy this one.\n\nWholeheartedly recommend.","January 17","true","12.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

The game pits you as a plague-striken botanist, exiled to a remote island where other unfortunate scientists have also been sent to discover a cure. You must continue their research in hope to escape the island alive.\n\nThe gameplay pits you exploring the island to search for and study the local plant life in hopes of synthesizing an antidote. The island is lush with plants, wildlife, and significant landmarks. Research stations and outposts are scattered throughout the island, some containing clues, notes, and other pieces of information to aid your quest.\n\nCautious travel throughout the land is imperative as darkness unfolds. The rolling hills can be unforgiving in your weakened state causing momentum to send you over the edge. Mapping is essential to your travel and the use of triangulation to pinpoint your location not only proves innovative, but really makes the overall gameplay feel like a genuine survival game. But don't linger around too long out in the darkness as a creature lurks in the distance watching your every move, thwarting your efforts to gather the necessary ingredients to improve your health.\n\nThe graphics are pretty impressive; the different and distinct landscapes are breathtaking, and the shadowing as day transitions to night and back to day is amazing. The games includes fabulous musical scores as well. Overall, the game is really a unique experience.

As far as I (suburban dude) can tell, it's an eye-opening wilderness hiking simulator, where you experientially learn how it's a seriously bad idea to set off on a trip without lots of daylight, a clear goal, a good map, and plenty of water.\n\nTo be clear: the game doesn't lecture you about survival and navigation. Instead you get certain reflexes drilled into you after you stay out too late, run out of daylight, get lost and dehydrated, fall down a hill, stumble into a lake and drown. Since you can only save your game at certain locations, well, drowning after a day-long expedition is bad.\n\nThe orienteering and cartography mechanics are just plain neat (and well-described elsewhere). The game provides a layer of goals and some mysterious opposition to deal with, but those aspects just add context to the exploration. It's nicely atmospheric and very zen at times. And occasionally scary.\n\nKeep in mind that this is an "indie game by 2 guys", but more often than not it's a better-designed package than you might expect from that.

You basically have to identify at least two man made structures (Building, statue, beacon) to pinpoint where you are on the map then find other unknown structures that are also in view and they then become known. You can now use those identified structures as map elements. Don't wander too far, try to keep these map markers in view and keep checking the map to add more pieces to it.\n\nThe concoctions you can make are temporary ones or permanent ones. You can carry only one of each temporary type so don't bother making two basic medicines, just make one basic and one enhanced. The weapons seem practically useless so far, there is a beast that stalks you, attacking with knife or axe doesn't seem to bother it at all. Ducking into cover doesn't seem to help much but getting behind hard cover like a tree does.\n\nYou have to drink quite often but fresh water is plentiful, yet in seven game days I haven't eaten anything so the finds of bananas and apples lying around don't seem to matter.\n\nClimbing even the gentlest of slopes can be difficult and it is super easy to go tumbling off and falling. Try hitting reverse when sliding down a hill to slow your descent, that helps. Save by lighting anything (beacon, candle, fire, lantern) or by sleeping and keep an eye on the time, right mouse button brings up a compass and wrist watch, when it gets dark...it gets REALLY dark!

The devs went to great lengths to rethink gaming fundamentals such as mapping, stealth, even basic movement. These changes may spook a lot of players, but those that let go of traditional gaming conventions will discover a rich new genre of gaming.\n\nAt the core of this game is the mapping system. Left to map out the environment yourself with a compass and triangulation, I often tell people interested in this game that it is a cartography simulator. While some find this method of mapping tedious, it brought about something both rare in games, and exciting: getting lost. I was often faced with decisions regarding how far to explore because getting lost sucked. The flip side was that finding your way back to someplace familiar provided an awesome feeling of accomplishment!\n\nStealth comes into play when faced with an undefeatible predator. This mechanic was a rush. You have no indicator of where the predator is except that when it is near, your heart beats. Many hide now/ search later moments. Running like hell works often for a rush of adrenaline. Rushing towards a shack lit in candlelight while the beast is at your heels, then crouching in a corner hoping not to be noticed as you peek your head up to see if it's gone was a common thrill for me in this game.\n\nThe movement has been criticized by a few (at least), but I really enjoyed the dev's take on it. Think: momentum.\nYour character starts off relatively weak, so often times you are left to risk walking down a steep looking hill or trying to rush up one. Walking down presents you with having to press the back button as a way to balance/ control your descent. Ascending requires taking a bit of a run to push your way up. Misjudging either causes a tumble which drops your items in hand and a big chance at getting a fever. Both a bit of a hassle. Mostly, this doesn't pose much of a problem, however when chased by the predator I found it exciting as hell. Split moment decisions risking death or losing that plant that took a bit to find provided a truly unique gaming experience.\n\nWrap up: 14 y.o. into COD and hoping to play an indie FarCry? Pass. Enjoy discovery and exploration of both the gaming enviroment and new conventions?

If you're the kind of person who can allow yourself to get completely immersed into a virtual world, look past those flaws and give this world a try.\n\nYes, there are issues. The uphill/downhill momentum can at times feel a bit... overzealous. Graphical fidelity is all over the place - while the general environment and landscape looks beautiful from afar, certain ugly details are exposed given a close-up. Several Steam Achievements are broken. You should probably avoid Alt+Tabbing the game due to the dreaded "One Moment Please..." problem. Performance issues can bring the entire world to a complete standstill for several seconds at a time, and you'll eventually realize that the only thing that "no loading screens" really means is that loading can get you killed. As the game was made from scratch by a pair of brothers, this sort of stuff is to be expected. There is an unofficial community patch out there (along with other helpful game utilities), and I'd recommend that you check that out before taking things too far.\n\nBut to be perfectly honest, since I decided to give this game another try after a near-year-long hiatus taken shortly after the intro, I'm thankful that I didn't pass it up. As one of those aforementioned people who can immerse themselves in games quite easily, I found a tension in this game that few other games have ever made me feel. That moment when I'm standing on the porch of my safehouse, barren map in-hand, building up the courage to take my first step into the unknown. That moment when I've got my headphones cranked up, and I'm crouch-walking through the forest, eyes peeled, my heart stopping at the crunch of every twig. That moment when all hell has broken loose and I've gone into a full-on panic-sprint, knowing that my only chance at survival is to put myself at the complete mercy of the terrain and just run. Those moments are gaming gold.\n\nMiasmata has a bit of a learning curve; anybody who has played it can attest to that. For all of the things that this game can give to you, there are just as many things that it will leave you to take for yourself. You'll struggle with movement. You'll struggle with cartography. You'll leave the house a bit too late one night and find yourself completely lost, hopeless, and staring death in the face. But give this game your time and your effort, and it will give you a completely unreplicated experience in return.\n\nSave early, save often. Stay alert, stay alive.

The in-game instructions could have used some more clarity for the cartography, but honestly I felt foolish for not realizing how easy a system it was; simply making it more obvious that you have to tag an unknown landmark AFTER establishing your position with two known ones should have been obvious but for some reason wasn't.

It was made by two people, and it is therefore a little rough around the edges. The graphics are by no means bad, but they are certainly not AAA-quality. The two brothers who made the game designed the engine as well (which is kind of impressive), but they clearly were not able to optimize it to run as well as some better-known game engines, so you may not get quite the frame rate you expect, and you will see lab equipment pop-in when you approach a campsite. There are a few other things that are imperfect as well.\nAll that said, THIS GAME IS AMAZING! The strange thing about this game is that I had imagined a game remarkably similar to Miasmata, but never expected it to actually exist. When I saw it on Greenlight, I was surprised that such a game finally existed. When I played it, I was quite satisfied.\nThis is a true survival game: stand still long enough, and you will die from lack of water/fever/creature attack. Exploring the island, making your own map by triangulation, finding plants to make medicine, finding notes and journal entries that help you figure out what's going on, and hiding from that creature add up to a great survival experience. The movement system of the game is also great. It more effectively simulates illness than any other game I have seen. If you go down too steep a slope, or go down too fast, you'll slip, eventually going head over heels. You have to carefully manage your momentum by holding back while going down a slope, or examining the terrain to find a safe path down or around. This both avoids the usual video game problem of being able to run around everything in a way that would not work in real life, and the problem of walking becoming boring; your illness makes walking a game challenge. As a final note, I love the UI, more accurately, the lack of UI, in this game. Your character carries an actual journal and map that you use in real time.","November 29, 2013","true","20.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's actually the entire game. You wake up on a beach and have to roam the landscape, searching for botanical ingredients to a plague cure and piecing together the story of a group of researchers who recently occupied the area.\n\nThe really great bit to the game is how a handful of minor obstacles shape the experience. Your character starts the game sick, so he's not able to run for long without getting winded, climb steep slopes, or swim more the a few feet in deep water. If you try to push him harder, he'll just get sicker. When he starts to run a fever, he needs medicine or bedrest or it gets slowly worse until he collapses. When you're not as sick, it's still very easy to get lost. There's a map, but you have to update it by triangulating your location from known landmarks. On top of all that, there's a mysterious creature on the island that occasionally harrasses you. All the obstacles are pretty easy to overcome or avoid, but when you make one mistake, it usually snowballs, culminating in a frenzied attempt to get to safety.\n\nThe story is very minimal and based mostly on found notes, but it's just enough to add to the mood while letting the experience be your own. Miasmata has a very lonely beauty to it and few limits that seem artificial.  Almost the entire experience is just you stumbling through the woods, but it still manages to be compelling.","September 27, 2013","true","15.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The main draw for me is that you never have a persistent map that shows your location, instead you have find your location by triangulating with known landmarks, which encourages caution in exploration and always checking your bearings. If you think you can just go running into the woods haphazardly think again because the game will punish you with one or a combination of three mechanics:\n\nThe first mechanic is realistic terrain traversal and falling mechanics. Your character builds momentum as they go down gradients and you can't just stop on a dime, which is particularly dangerous if you're right next to a cliff. Falling is also realistic, as your character will take damage, drop items, and get stunned from heights that one would expect to get hurt from in real life.\n\nThe second is the creature, the single enemy in the game that persistently follows you, the idea of which always keeps you on edge, I actually found it quite frightening.You can't kill it, the game purposely leaves weapons lying around to prove this point, and you can't flat out outrun it. It makes you think twice about going out at night, and you'll always keep in mind where is the nearest body of water.\n\nThe third is simply getting lost. As I've mentioned before since there is no persistent map it is very easy to lose track of where you are and to just start going around in circles aimlessly in the woods. The game purposesly gives you a limited amount of inventory slots, and you'll die out quick if you don't know where you're going.\n\nGiven the love the developers have put into this three game and the unique mechanics, it is well worth the $15 they're asking for.","July 11, 2015","true","4.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As a man with the plague, you find yourself strandes on the island of Eden and must find your way in first person to concoct treatments and, eventually, the cure for your ailment. But there's more than the plague and the hazards of the island to deal with... A massive feline that is constantly on the move, and when it sniffs you out, you become its new plaything.\nFor two men (brothers I believe) working on this game alone from scratch (even the engine is in-house), the results of their labor is astonishing. The quality of the visuals show the lack of manpower, but are still so brilliant and beautiful. The depth of mechanics present in the game is great, from map triangulation and navigation to day/night and weather cycles to swimming and sleeping to just how many ways the plague affects your character.\nSome of these mechanics, as one might imagine, are more cumbersome than others. It's surprisingly easy to find your character sliding downhill and then tumbling head over heels, dropping everything you held in your hands for the way back. While weapons are present (rock, knife, etc.) and can be thrown, there's ironically no way to injure or kill other creatures (eating is not a mechanic in this game, so it's somewhat forgivable). However, your character is so fragile early on in the game that this alone often determines whether you live or die should you encounter the cat in a place where you can't find shelter or hide.\nIt's truly a shame that the cat had so much work put into it (seriously, it's the ONLY actual enemy in the game, and several blog posts from the devs talk about how much work was put into the AI for it), and yet for so many, myself included, it feels as though the game would be better off without it. The design of the creature is pretty neat, and all that goes into how it acts around you, how its presence affects your character, is amazing to me - but it feels entirely unnecessary and oftentimes serves more as a frustrating barrier to meeting your goals than an actual threat, especially when you figure out how to manipulate it. Yep, even with all of the enemy AI compiled into one creature, this beast is still easily manipulated. At least he attacks you now - which wasn't the case shortly before I bought this game. The poor thing was bugged and would just follow you around until it decided to bugger off.\nStill, this game is a great experience, and the storytelling is slow and delicious with the exploration for survival. It's a long one too, especially if you have no idea where to go or become forgetful like me. I have several more hours in this game than listed (a fair amount of time spent offline) and I don't think I got much more than a third of the way through the game, mostly because I got lost. Which is easy to do.\nGive it a try if you're into survival. It will definitely scratch that itch.","March 24","true","4.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The beginning was a little weird and dull, but once you travel more into the island, you will begin to understand how you're supposed to play and think in this game. Such moment is when you realize this is a one-of-a-kind game.\n\nThe game tries to simulate realism, and although it may seem to go overboard on some parts, it does everything very well (except for nights, which are strangely pitch black even if moonlight should give a little help, so I reccommend you avoid being outside at night, but that's quite the only bad thing I see about this game).\n\nThe controls might as well be weird, but that's because it tries to simulate real life even more. You're not supposed to be able to turn around 180 degrees and run straight away just like that in real life, right? Well, you can't just do that in this game either. It's not something too bad though, and it's easy to get used to it.\n\nI was surprised when I reached one of the primary objectives in a certain place of the island, where the scenery was just great, and the search for a specific rare plant, was an interesting experience like in no other game.\n\nWhen I encountered the "Creature" (which I like to refer to as Miasmata, even if that's a bit cheesy and the creature has no official name), that's when the game turned much more into a survival game. I was always checking my surroundings carefully and hiding from a practically invincible beast, until the moment I'd notice the creature is nearby, and that always made my heart race, even if this game isn't a horror or anything scary based game. You have to manage to not only survive your sickness, but you also have to survive being hunted down by such predator.\n\nOverral, this game is one of the greatest survival/adventure games out there in my opinion, as I really love this game and it got me addicted very soon after I began playing. Rating: 9.5/10, would have been a full 10 if it wasn't for the unfortunately frustrating pitch black nights.","August 18, 2014","true","14.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The graphic quality almost reaches the standards of extremely expensive engines made by big companies, but is in fact made by just 2 guys. Surely it has some flaws, like the grainy looking water in the distance and no waves along the shores. The fog sometimes act a little bit strange and there are proplems like torches/sticks dont illuminate the logbook or map. But all of that is compensated by the incredible atmosphere. Starting extremely weak and as easy pray, you have to find water, plants and safe spots to survive. Creating medicine to keep you alive and to find the cure for the plague. Running around the island can be tricky sometimes, because the terrain affects your speed. It requires a lot of strenght to climb up a hill and you may stumble while running down, which causes a headache and in the worst case deadly high fever. Another great feature is, how you can create the map of the island. The easy method is to find pieces of the map around the camps. The other method is to draw a small piece of it by marking 2 known landmarks which are in sight. While exploring the island, you are watched by a creature lurking in the shadows of the Jungle, which will soon start to hunt you down. You dont have weapons and all you can do is to hide, distract the creature or run for you life.

The games motivation come from exploring, you keep finding little notes everywhere, which drive the story. Even though it says that you are sick and you need to develop a cure, you will never die as long you keep drinking and sleeping, and out of the creatures way, which is (mildly) stalking you. The game looks a little antiquated, but it still managed to be beautiful at times.

It starts out pretty rough at least partly by design, as being thrown into an unfamiliar setting and being so physically weak that you can barely move around and get easily lost are all part of the character. However, as you play the game you will learn how to get around more easily with the cartography mechanics, creating the right drugs to get you out of tough situations, and just as a result of internalizing the game's systems. Each time you create a shot that returns some of your physical abiltiies to normal the regular paths become easier to traverse and more difficult places become reachable. By the end of the game, you can get around so easily that it's hard to remember how rough it was at the beginning.

You explore and chart an island, find ingredients, craft potions with them and try not to get eaten by a mysterious creature that lives on the island. Your ultimate goal is to find the correct ingredients to create a cure for a plague that has infected humanity, including you.\n\nAt first this may sound like a typical survival horror game, but it is not. You will hardly ever see the creature and if you do it's relatively easy to escape or hide. The potions you craft aren't really needed either as the creature is the only enemy in the game and all you need to stay alive is water (which you can find almost everywhere) and a bed (which is also easy to find since there are huts and tents from a previous expedition scattered across the island). So why is it fun you may ask. Simply because the island looks beautiful and is fun to explore, the cartography game mechanic is wonderfully implemented and moving your character around is fun and different as well - since he's infected with a disease he is quite hard to control (in a positive way) and if you don't pay attention he'll fall down a ledge or pass out.\n\nIf you're looking for an action game or a (survival) horror game look elsewhere. If you like a relaxing game where you slowly explore an island and discover what happened to the scientific expedition that arrived there before you then Miasmata is definitely worth playing.","June 5, 2014","true","15.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However, they are still a few bugs that needs to be addressed/fixed before they role this out into the public. I don't know why steam only logged me for 0.2 hours on this game when I clearly spent 2 hours or more exploring everything, but here's my take on some of the negative thinks I found in the game.\n\n1.) Often times, my character would clip through rocky surfaces, house walls, trees and even fall under the map. This needs to be fixed.\n\n2.) Sometimes when you die, the character's voice would get stuck in a loop until you restart, load or exit the game.\n\n3.) Often times I would die for no reason, such as walking knee-high on water or clipping houses and structures.\n\nApart from that, this game has been very wonderful. While I do believe and feel that this game still feels like it's in early access and should be polished up more, I will not deny that this game offers replayability and numerous content for players to enjoy. I hope the developers take the time to address these issues with an update in the future.\n\n8/10 - My honest review.","December 14, 2015","true","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is not a typical game, in that you lack the tools necessary to kill the critter, but you are on the island to save your civilization from a terrible plague, and if you are clever, you will.  I loved scurrying through the underbrush trying to find the proper vantage points to triangulate distances and map the world, it was an odd and enjoyable mechanic that I became kinda OCD about doing over and over again.

It took me a long time to play it, as I had the game for several years before I finished it. It was one of my "I have nothing to play... oh, wait, let's do something in this for a bit" games.\n\nMiasmata utilizes a rather interesting mechanic: a triangulation process for mapping out the island and finding your location, which makes this game stand out a lot as I have not seen anything like it elsewhere. The AI for the monster is wonderful, as it seems to show up with enough frequency and has some great pathing and bahaviors, much like a real cat. The fact that it could show up at any time, especially when you are covering lots of ground quickly, adds to the tension and creates a great atmosphere. The snippets of story through notes create a chilling mystery set on a suprisingly beautiful island.\n\nThis game, if comparrisons are made, somewhat feels "slender-esque" as you are a plague victim scouring the island for plants to synthesize a cure, and medicines to keep you alive along the way. I feel like the monster shows up more as you get closer to completion of the cure and it seems to show up more in critical areas, such as places where X plant for the cure is guarenteed.\n\nMy only issue with the game revolved around the controls. The movement of the character can be wonky sometimes. I feel like it does a great job of simulating the rigors of climbing with sliding and exhaustion; however, there are many times I'd want to move a foot or so forward, maybe down a 2% grade, and the guy would either overstep or just take off running. Many a cliff have I fallen from due to this "over/undersensitivity." I've found that alternating between forward and backward as you walk down any slope can greatly reduce the threat of "tripping."\n\nThere are also times where you'd trip from one-foot drops, get stuck on stairs or small logs (which is terrible when you are being pursued), bump a tree the wrong way and bounce off sideways, be following a curved ledge and start sliding to the right. I just felt I, as a human being, would be able to have better control of my footing; the game makes me feel like a baby who has just learned how to walk, yet lacks basic control.\n\nOther than movement mechanics, I have greatly enjoyed the game so far. I enjoy exploration games and find that the ability to triagulate on the map adds more to the exploration reward. Miasmata has just enough tension and "horror" to attract fans of those genres and manages to stay fresh, as the map is fairly well-sized, allowing for many hours of play.","December 8, 2014","true","33.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I love the idea of relaxing exploration and not having to worry about overpowered boss fights and too many objectives to complete. The story behind it is reletively interesting, and the lack of information adds to the mystery of the game, definately accentuate the overall feeling.\n\nIt's more the mechanics of the game that were sub-par. Movement and actions of the player are well done, nothing too impresive. The animations are present and seem more or less realistic, not accounting for the visual graphics, but are quite repetitive. The graphics aren't stellar by any means. This doesn't detract from the game and Miasmata is an indie game.\n\nThe specific part of Miasmata that really put me off was the mapping. Great parts about the mapping system are that there is no icon saying 'YOU ARE HERE'. Also, the map isn't just given at the begining of the game, promoting exploration to uncover the territory. The negative of the mapping is the diffuculty to 'write down' where has been explored and where hasn't. This system, while a very interesting idea, is poorly executed.\n\nOverall, this is an interesting idea of a game, yet the system within the game are severly lacking; 6 out of 10","July 3, 2014","false","4.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I liked that part. They also did a great job with the plant life and landscape of the island. I never felt like I was walking through the same repeated textures and wilderness. It really felt like the woods. I grew up in the woods so I have a pretty good idea of what wandering around in them feels like and they pulled this off.\n\nHere's why I ultimately didn't like this game. It just got boring. Once the scenic beauty wore off and the a lot of the statues and plants were found and a few run ins with the monster that is stalking me. I would just kind of wander around looking for something to do and the only thing to do was to look for more plants which couldn't keep my interest.

While it could utilize a lot of work (including creating your own marker points) it is the first semi-realistic mapping system I have seen.\n\nCons:\nBad Physics with a fair try.  they tried to make the system quasi physics based (but took physics 101 and stupped), the speeds and slowdowns are unrealistic and remind me of mario on ice or something that way.  Your like some old weak freak that can't climb worth crap or fall more than 3 inches, gets tired after a short (very short) sprint, and falls like a drunk on saturday night.  Moving is frustrating and pathetic.\n\nYou can only carry one object, 3 flowers, and apparently a book with you.  While many games let you carry more than is realistic, this game thinks the only place to hold things is your hand apparently.  Oh and don't go for a swim, you will drop everything (and likely never find it again), even a tiny pond can mess you up.\n\nGraphics Suck:  There is no brightness control, so at night on my screen is pitch black, a cloud makes it as dark as night would be.  Due to the poor graphics (I maxed them out and still the detail is crap) you can see things very far away with in detail, as the game's mapping system requires you notice things far away, this is a pain.\n\nBoring:  Outside of mapping and needing to drink 5 galons of water a day, the only thing you do is gather plants in an attempt to find the right mixes.  There is a beast on the island to chase you around, though I am not exactly sure why.  You can only carry three flowers on you, so to do any real experimenting requires you do a lot of back and forth.  No need to protect yourself from weather or even eat food, so it does not even qualify as a survival game.\n\nSuggestions:\nTake the mapping system, get rid of the monsters, and be the first true survival game.  So many games out there come close on a lot of areas, but mess it up by either adding unbeatable uber monsters or have crappy world interactions.  This game does both. The idea of a quest/story line is great, but it's so tedious and slow to get flowers, the I feel it falls very short of it's potential benefit.\n","April 24","false","2.6"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

I bought this game quite a while ago, and I really wanted to love this game. However I found it impossible to do so, which is a shame. Alright, let's go!\n\nPros:\n\nBeautiful environment, simply brilliant graphics, with the weather patterns, day/night cycle, and the flora and fauna all fully realized and vibrant. Honestly, this game would be worth sale price simply for the graphics if you appreciate games like that.\n\nThe mapping system is unique and realistic, but not TOO real as to render it not fun. In other words, it's as real as a game can make it while still being a game. I really enjoyed walking around just mapping the island. Definitely this is the game's strongest point.\n\nCons:\n\nWhile the environment is well done, the detail on the hands and arms of the player are absolutely ATROCIOUS! Bad enough that, to this day, I use the term "Miasmata hands" to reflect a poorly designed first-person model. They could have at least used the standard cop-out of putting a watch or bracelet on the player's wrist to at least ease the pain of having to look at 2 ham shanks on the end of bologna rolls.\n\nThe plot. Spoiler alert, your character is ill, and you must find a cure. I believe this to be an unnecessary handicap in the early game, and I personally found it insurmountable due to the rather boring nature of the quest. Also, you can't do too much in the way of travelling or running around until you found the cure.\n\nThe "creature" is just a joke. I will say no more, just take my word for it.\n\nThe controls are some of the worst I've ever seen. When you move the mouse, there's a delay in the motion, and when you stop, the camera "shakes" and your hands lapse over where you stopped the movement. It's really hard to describe, almost like it takes time to gain and lose momentum when looking. The same thing happens when you walk or run, which can be the death of you if you're near an edge you didn't see. Also, this same delay is present in everything you do, which is really annoying.\n\nI wish this game were better, as the concept could have been great. I just can't give this game a positive review due to all its faults.\n\nThanks for reading, and have an awesome day!\n","February 27, 2014","false","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

There's no indication of what direction it's in, and if you see it out of cover it will see you.  However it doesn't really move very fast so if you just run away you're fine.  Despite what the store page says, it doesn't really track you- it just randomly spawns near you.  So, just run in practically any direction and you're fine until it randomly spawns near you again.  Pointless.  Oh and if it hits you, you die instantly.\n\nThe landmark system sounds clever except for the fact that trees and inclines seem to be placed specifically so that you can't see landmarks most of the time.  Also there seem to be no sanity checks involved.  You can walk like 10 feet for a second triangulation to verify where distant landmarks are, and can use landmarks that are in line with you to verify your own position.  There's no minimum angle between landmarks or minimum distance between triangulations.\n\nHealth is represented solely by how sick you are.  So, falling down a cliff gives you a fever, rather than bruises.  There's food on the island but you can't eat any of it because it's all half-rotten fruit.  You can supposedly drink from any non-saltwater source, but I already found a river that I couldn't drink from.\n\nThis game is a MESS.","May 21, 2013","false","2.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Turns out, the ending sucked balls as well!

Games like these feature a few neat gimmicks, a loosely established goal, and a veneer of realism, but are plagued by bugs and shoddy mechanics that are doomed to never be fixed. Today these games sit in the early-access section getting trivial updates every month or so until suddenly the developers get bored or realize that nobody is buying their game anymore and they give up. The game is left unfinished and forgotten.\nMiasmata gives the impression of being one of these forgotten end-products, except someone accidentally gave it a full release.\n\n\nOld Version:\nI was mildly enjoying this game until I accidentally strayed from the exact path the game wanted me to follow and I became hopelessly lost, unable to chart anything on my map, because obviously you can't map anything without a reference that is already on your map! You can't like start a new map and combine it with your old one later or something! That would be silly!\n\nOther assorted problems:\nThe flame of the lighter has a faint green square around it where transparency is supposed to be.\nTrees produce an unnatural aura of darkness.\nNight is pitch black and if you aren't near a bed you basically have to stand around for 15 minutes until the sun rises.\nFalling over gives you a debilitating illness. (SO REALISTIC)\nYour character seems to think slopes are about twice as steep as they actually are.\nThe monster is really dumb and it's hard to tell if you can even interact with it because its behavior makes no sense.\nI think there's some other glitchy stuff but I don't remember. I last played this game like over a year ago.\n\nGood things:\nThe interface with the journal and the water bottle and medicine and stuff is pretty cool.\nCollecting flowers and mushrooms and making stuff is pretty cool I guess.\nThe concept of the map making is pretty cool.\nThat's about it.","March 27, 2014","false","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

I purchased this game a few years ago, but the game demanded high specifications and I didn't have that. Today, I own a GTX 780, 16GB RAM, i7-2600K, H60 Corsair WaterCooler and Windows 10. I was a bit disappointed because the game is still rather demanding. I ran the game at max setthings at approximately 80fps for the first 7 hours before it decreased down to approximately 50fps. Temperatures were constant at around 30-50 degrees celsius. The frame rate dropped to around 40fps when I entered the swamps to get the Bio-Luminescent Algae. I would honestly say that this game is BADLY optimized. There are a lot of BUGS, screen freeze, random lags, black outs and crashes. I had approximately 15 game crashes, 5 screen freeze and 3 black outs. When I start the game sometimes the background and the menu gets divided into crazy horizontal shaky lines, then the game crash. The game crashes when I press Esc and go to the menu and stay there for a couple of minutes. It also crashes when I go back to Windows or on the Steam Overlay. It also crashes when I get a random screen freeze / black out. However, I managed to save the game before every crash. My screen only froze and turned black when I toggled the map twice. The character is EXTREMELY BUGGY, when I want to walk to the right I skate to the left, when I want to walk backwards, I become super super slow, when I am running really fast I began to slide down and then tumble down, then I eventually lose my plants and weapons. I do not like the animation of the character. It feels cheap and unrealistic. I am not even swaying my weapon properly, my right arm is so STIFF that I cannot bend it. When I throw my weapon the swooshing sound effect is delayed for like 1-2 seconds. The graphics of the game needs more texture, the natural environment looks pretty to look at, but I do not like how the characters where made and especially my hands. I enjoyed the plot and the twist of the game. However IonFx should have spent more time on the ending. There should be different endings to add more playtime and make the game more interesting. E.G.

Ultimately, it's the little things that make this game unenjoyable.\n\n1. "What the heck am I seeing?"\nWhen you shave off so much of the UI as to be non-existant, you defeat the purpose. There is almost no in-game text to help discern what you are looking at. I am not a botanist, so don't expect me to instantly categorize and identify each plant the game presents. Since textures are recycled so much, it is impossible to discern or orient yourself (see gripe #3).\n\n2. "What the heck am I hearing?"\nPut simply, the sound is atrocious. It lacks true ambience, and the music only comes up in the menu. Most annoying is the fact that the same bass effect is used for being preyed upon by predators AND the sound of your heart when you strain yourself, so after one too many encounters you cannot tell if your character is just paranoid or stupid.\n\n3. "Where the heck am I?"\nGetting lost sucks. It isn't fun to try to figure out where you are. Coming back to the game later means having almost no idea where anything is anymore. You get a map, but you have to fill it in manually by way of triangulation... except that the surroundings are so thick that you cannot view almost any landmark - and no, you cannot look through the foliage. The fact that you are under pressure of a disease means meandering about aimlessly is not an option... which takes us to gripe number 4.\n\n4. You can only carry one of anything.\nI spent hours of game time harvesting ingredients and making multiple doses of key medicines, only to find later that I only had one dose in my inventory. The game never tells you that your giant pillbox can hold only a single dose of anything. I get easily fifty mints in an Altoid tin, so don't tell me this is even close to the realism they otherwise try to evoke.\n\n5. Immersion is great, until it becomes boring.\nWalking simulators have to strike a fine balance between distance and speed, and this game strikes out on this concept. After the third time getting exhausted for having to sprint, it gets annoying. The environments aren't so spectacular that I can enjoy these woods. Firewatch got it much better. Look, I get that the character is supposed to be some weakling geek, but asthma sucks enough in real life without needing to bring it into a game. What next, "chemo sim 1995, where you get to watch your body rot!" - no thanks.\n\n6. Slopes and momentum are not your friend.\nMore to the point, you have all the control of a drunkard. Walking along a slight bank, only to have the angle shift juuuust enough so that the game decides you get to take a tumble downhill is just aggravating.\n\n7. Tools get lost with a sneeze, but plant samples? Deathgrip!\nThe game tries so hard to be realistic but the fact that if you swim or fall then you are forced to drop weapons, yet your samples remain grasped firmly in hand is contradictory. Annoying design choices are blatant for being sophomorish.\n\n8. Food is unnecessary, apparently!\nExertion, exhaustion, strain, thirst, carrying capacity... all of these are carefully tracked in the game. Survival should incorporate food/hunger. Maybe I never got that far in the game, but after 4 days in the game world, you would expect some grumblies in the tumblies. Rabbit is tasty!\n\n9. Critters. Critters everywhere, and more silent than ninjas!\nAdd them to the ambience, or let us kill them for food. The fuzzy animals should make fine eats, but the varmints and vermin are purely atmospheric.\n\n10. Useless samples are useless\nLiterally, why bother at all? I get it, some of them don't make medicines. However the fact that this botanist can't turn them into deterrents for predators is ludicrous. Since the UI is so minimal, there is literally no way to drop the useless stuff. Worst of all, using them in crafting wastes the useful materials - you have to figure that out, however, the hard way.\n\n11. You cannot escape the menu\nThis seems like a minor gripe, but it is like I said at the start that the little things add up. Having to click out of the menu that you can only access by way of the ESC key is just another example of how the developer fails to understand basic concepts of UX.\n\nTL;DR:\nThis game is just bad. Play it if you enjoy role-playing a suffering, dying, asthmatic dweeb with zero survival skills and no preservation instinct.","February 21","false","2.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

You can pick up rocks and throw them, you can pick up wood and make a torch, you have to drink regularly, you need to triangulate your location on a map instead of having a pointer that shows you exactly where you are at anytime etc.\nYet this makes the game feel even weirder in other parts. The character moves is pretty unrealistic, you cannot swim (maybe you can train it), the triangulation works perfectly (if you figured out how) without any kind of equipment to measure distances or calculate or anything. The research is ridiculous, you grab a flower go to a shack with a microscope (and they are miraculously all over the island) cut it up, put it under the microscope and suddenly you know exactly that this thing is very effective in curing fever...if only real life science would be that easy.\nTo top things off the inventory is amazing, not that you could carry infinite amounty of stuff, no...you can carry everything that fits in your hand...and only one hand at a time.\nIt is cruel to the devs, but this game is for me nothing more than a redoing of the Slender Man game with more stupid ♥♥♥♥ in it.\n\nEdit:\nAfter playing it some more I stand with my previous review.","March 14, 2014","false","2.0"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

It's a neat idea, but the execution and sheer lack of anything to do just makes it mind numbling awful to play.  You play as a scientist trying to find a cure for a disease you have by experimenting with various plants throughout the island you're trapped on.  So literally the entire game is running around a giant island looking for plants, coming back to a lab to test then, rinse and repeat until you get your cure.  Honestly it wouldn't be too bad if the game mechanics worked ok, but as said in my opening line you have about as much coordination as a mentally handicapped racoon.  Combine that with such other wonders as drowning in 3 inches of water, and you get a game who's soul aspect is exploration with incredibly aggravating controls to perform said exploration.","January 18, 2015","false","1.6"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","5","0","0"

This is hands down the most unique game I've ever played. A true indie at heart, both in its feel, design and execution. Instead of blatantly placing you on an island full of monstrocities with gun in hand, you are unarmed, with only one menace stalking you. That's the initial picture at least. It soon becomes clear that much more to fear.\n\nOne of the greatest things about this game is how it is actually possibly to become utterly lost. This sounds weird, but in almost every other game there some way of tracking that gives you the secure feeling that you know where you are. Most games have a minimap of some kind, a map with a marker, or something else. Miasmata has a blank sheet of paper. And no matter how much you explore, this piece of paper will stay blank until you actively start drawing a map on it. Doing so is not easy: you need to triangulate your location by use of landmarks. You might be in a new zone without a clue what to do: none of the landmarks are familiar to you, and the area isn't charted. One of the creepiest things in the game was leaving your outpost and explore this uncharted land, knowing that you would become lost within a minute, struggling to find your way back, and possibly at the mercy of this beast. For me that's the true power of this game.\n\nA second greatest thing about this game is the fact that you're doing something you'll never do in any other game: harvest and research plants to make a cure for an illness (some RPGs may do this in a quest but this is an entire game based around it). It sounds horribly boring, but combined with the tension this game gives you, it is an absolutely interesting task. Those who've played this game might recall the luminous algae you had to find: I was utterly terrified during that section.\n\nThird, the walking and climbing mechanics are amazing. This is the only game where it really felt as if you had momentum when you ran. Running at full speed really felt like running, the risk of tripping adding to the feeling. It actually feels as if you struggle to climb up a mountain. It actually feels as if you put your weight against the slope of a mountain when you are descending.\n\nA fourth aspect is how the story is much more than meets the eye. Admittedly I didn't care much for it while playing because I lost track over the months (partly based on the one negative thing, the repetitiveness), but reading back some of the ideas and interpretations on the forum here really opened a much more complex picture than what I would've thought while playing.\n\nTL;DR I can rant on and on about this for about the length of a small essay but I'll leave it at this: if you enjoy a good indie title, try this game.","November 25, 2014","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a first-person exploration / adventure game.  But instead of puzzles, there is a nifty mapping mechanic based on triangulation and finding landmarks and a search for plants that you can study and use to synthesize the medicines you need to survive.\n\nThis game doesn't hold your hand and lead you through the plot.  There are no cut-scenes and no lousy voice-acting.  You have to piece the story together for yourself and decide where to go and what to do based on what you find as you explore the island.  And you can explore in pretty much any direction and any order you like.\n\nThis is not your typical video-game power fantasy.  You start out as a character who is sick, can't swim, has trouble even walking around, and is in danger of tumbling down a steep incline and triggering a debilitating fever.  But the progression from sickness to health felt more empowering than the typical game that takes you from warrior to demigod.\n\nThe graphics are not state-of-the-art.  This was made by a two-man team.  But the island is still a beautiful and interesting place to explore and the weather and time of day make a real difference in what you see and what you can do.  It feels like a real place that remains vivid in my mind months later.","December 26, 2013","true","32.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're cast away on an island, suffering from some kind of plague, and your aim is to find a cure as soon as possible. Luckily, there has already been some kind of a research team on the island but something has happened to them...\n\nI will start by saying that Miasmata is terribly beautiful. The graphics isn't always perfect but all in all the environments are amazing. I am incredibly impressed by the two brothers who made this game and the game engine on which it runs. Miasmata is immersive; My first night playing I couldn't stop until four in the morning, when I reluctantly realized it was getting light outside.\n\nTo find a cure for your plague you have to find and research the plants and fungi on the island. It sounds trivial, but in Miasmata there is noone to hold your hand. You have to make progress using the notebooks you find from the earlier research team and on your own findings. The game is completely open world and you have no checkpoints or route to follow.\n\nThere is also no automatic map. Instead, you draw your map using triangulation. Two known landmarks give you your position on the map and is what you use to update your map. Other than that you have to use your compass and your memory. (Orienteerers probably have an advantage!)\n\nYou have no classic menus or inventory, instead you check your log book where all your notes and research is saved. You can also check on how you are feeling and take drugs for fever or other conditions.\n\nThese three elements: Open world, the map system, and the log book creates a massively immersive feeling. Every menu, note or inventory has a "real" representation in the game.\n\nOther than that Miasmata is a creepy game which gave me some big adrenaline rushes. Instead of jumpscares, Miasmata provides the unnerving feeling of always being followed (and the panic of being discovered). Nature is also an enemy: Climbing mountains isn't easy and if you run too fast down a slope you will fall. Hopefully you know where you are when you are back in control, but in worst case you are lost and have to start looking for known landmarks again.\n\nOn the negative side: I have to admit I was on several occations frustrated and annoyed when my assiduous exploration was interrupted. (By what, I will not mention...) I actually even rage quitted several times (but only to start it again after a minutes). At the same time, this is part of what is charming with the game and what creates intensity.\nThere are also some small bugs, but nothing that can't be easily solved.\n\nA final warning to those who want to be able to close down a game quickly: You can save only at given save points. They are many and spread widely, but it can be good to know if you are the kind of gamer that have to be able to close down with just some seconds notice.\n\n7/10 petals","December 27, 2014","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you like high action, this is not your game. There is a bad glitch I keep encountering more and more. Ocassionally the character freezes up and won't turn right or left.

Mapping and discovery on the island was actually pretty smart.\n\nThe problems start when you first starting moving around.....(jello-ing around?). Your character walks quite realistically, tripping and not immediately changing direction. It's neat for about 5 whole minutes, funny for the first few rolls down a hill/cliff, and then you just want it to stop. Then you survive. Pick some flowers and moss then run back to a shed to science it up, you got some pills...repeat. Lastly the demon creature that's on the island failed to meet the hype for me.

In any case the game is a unique experience AND a niche game, so its not for everyone plus it has its faults (clipping issues, mapping can be tedious especially in the beginning and some objects like tends just vanish if they are farther away but can still be used as a point for triangulation if you know where they are, some graphics and textures don't look like they belong in because the rest of the environment is so well made and looks really beautiful) but those are only minor issues and didn't spoil my enjoyment in any serious way.\n\nMiasmata lives from its immersive atmosphere when I came home from a trip I made my medicine, studied my journal and map and planed the next tour for tomorrow before I sat down on the edge off a cliff and watched the sunset or the cloudburst over the sea and just enjoyed the world around me.The game for me like for some others was a "slow starter", I didn't really like the first 1-2 hours very much, maybe because I already knew the beginning from lets plays or because I felt so lost without clear cut instructions other than to make the cure and no way to tell were the ♥♥♥♥ I am right now, but as time flew by and I made progress I got slowly sucked into the world of Miasmata. Music plays sparingly but its very soothing and fitting in such situations when you just barely escaped the creature and reached a new safe haven or watch the sun go down from your shack before taking some well earned rest.\n\nThe creature while not particularly smart or scary looking definitely gave me some memorable moments and is really the last thing you want to bump into when you spend your last 15 min mapping and trying to reach an outpost before night sets in. One day I ventured out found two new plants, got a lot of mapping done and forgot about the time so I didn't make it back to my base before nightfall. I got tired of waiting and my water was running out so I decided I will just try to slowly stumble forward through the darkness when suddenly I hear my heart beat. I turned around running as fast as I can before falling down a ridge landing in some bushes. Instinctively I ducked down and in the next moment the silhouette of the creature appeared on the ridge of the hill wandering around before running off.Needless to say I spend the rest of the night cowering in fetal position under my bush praying that Milo doesn't come back. I lost my plants but I survived that night, without water and a fever I dragged myself to a near outpost in the next morning and from that moment on I made sure to always make it home in time. Thats just one example, I had a few more thrilling moments but I will keep those to myself. And just to give you an idea I met the beast around 10-15 times in my 18h of playtime and that was just the right amount to keep it somewhat special.\n\nAfter playing it 76/100 as a neutral rating seems about right when you consider all the minor flaws it has and that it could have been even better with a bit more polish, but my personal rating would be closer to a 90/100 and I would definitely buy it again even at full price.","February 11, 2015","true","20.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/capt_blakhelm/recommended/223510/","capt_blakhelm","Capt_Blakhelm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/capt_blakhelm/","1574 products in account","Buy? Likely\n\n-=TL;DR=-\nMiasmata is a unique, first-person survival exploration game where the player must stave off symptoms of a deadly fever that accelerates thirst, weakens the body and somehow either through hallucination or some sort of attraction affect, spawns a deadly, nearly indescribable horror simply referred to the creature. This beast is basically invincible, faster than you and can kill you in two claw swipes. The player must use a combination of cartography and chemistry to find and use plant life across the island of Eden to mitigate and eventually cure his ailment. Miasmata enforces the fact that you are a frail person, collecting herbs while managing thirst and fatigue, and gave me a sense of dread and fear that no horror game has ever given me.\n\n-=Presentation=-\nThis is both arguably the best and worse part of the game. Upon getting off the canoe at the start, you're present a beautifully lit island with loads of flora, ambience and world design that immediately immerses you in the world. Yet, the minute you turn around to look at your boat or bother to look at your hands are the ground below you, the models and textures are only barely better than a PS2 era game. It's extremely jarring to see a world that looks much like Skyrim with ENB and flora mods, but with textures only moderately better than Morrowind. Standing water around the island looks great, but beyond that, there is no volumetric water: The water you drink from ponds is invisible and the water poured from pitchers are literally solid beads that would only look like water from a far distance. Also, the draw distance and level of detail is kind of atrocious for a game that looks like this - world  details (rocks, plants) within 8-12 feet in front of you update model quality or pop-in out of nowhere like some sort of hologram effect from a sci-fi movie. It severely ruins the immersive experience the developers were trying to create, and it's strange why there is no included options to manage level of detail for stronger PCs.\n\nIn spite of all the visual presentation issues, you can often find many screenshot worthy moments as the sun light, god rays, water reflection, cloud and tree shadows have an effect on the medium-low quality environment, proving that lighting effects can drastically improve the look of a game.\n\nThe audio presentation is pretty good. There are appropriate sound effects for any action in the game from walking on dirt, wood, or rocks, to swimming, drinking water to swinging a weapon and opening up the map or journal. There are occasional sound cues when turning on lights. The majority of you sound will be in the form of blowing wind, rushing waters, lively critters, and of course, the roars of the godforsaken beast and the heartbeat the PC has the moment it gets near you.  The occasional music that plays as you discover camps and various settlements is of a light, symphonic, ambient mood.\n\n-=Gameplay=-\nI can't believe I said so much about the presentation - the gameplay and mechanics are always the most important factors of a game to me. You are Robert Hughes, and you must cure your plague. You will gradually find notes and clues about harvesting ingredients, discovering locations, and using cartography to map your position. Yes, Cartography. There are no waypoints or Skyrim-esque "quest objective is right here!" map markers here, though campsites, statues and other landmarks are marked on your paper map as you properly locate them via triangulation or partial maps across the island. It is easy to get lost among the trees and mountains and it is generally best to use landmarks, trails, coastlines, and various "world formations" in tandem with collected partial maps and your compass to get an idea of where you are and where you are going.\n\nYou can pick up and throw items like fruit, rocks, axes, knives, and household objects, though it's all there to remind you that you are a frail person - none of these except from fire made from torches are even remotely useful in dealing with the creature. Combat only exists for the creature. This means you must hide or bore the creature enough to get away from it. You can run, but it's not always suggested as it can catch up to you almost immediately. It stalks you slowly when you walk and it's best to look around and find a good path to move, before finally running to a building to hide in or a object to hide behind.\n\nThe problem with running in this game is not only the creature faster than you, but you are easily fatigued unless you prepared yourself with endurance medicine you made from plant life. Plus, Robert has a bit of a "Sonic syndrome" where he has a hard time running up hills and sprints madly down hills. You have to manage this inertia by carefully finding proper pathways around and avoiding steep falls, since he is a clumsy idiot who can barely control his movement apparently, and will contract a fever that will blur your vision and slow your movement if you fall. It's a bit of a nuisance to control the character and it will definitely make many gamers dislike Miasmata. Though, if the game had a normal first person movement system, much of the tension would be lost since you're no longer accidentally running into the creature and not struggling to get up hills. Because of that, I cautiously welcome it - after all I would probably use slopes to increase my speed if I needed too.\n\nThe bulk of the game is finding herbs and fungi to research for medicines, drinkable temporary buffs, injectable permanent buffs and eventually the cure. You get clues on what to use from notes around the island and personal examinations on plants. Just be careful with your limited storage bin, 3 holdable plants and ease of dropping them if you trip and fall.\n\n-=Summary=-\nMiasmata is a tense survival game that definitely helped scratch my itch for exploration. It offered an non-combat experience I've never had before and made me legitimately scared of the creature until I knew how to exploit it (unfortunately, he more annoying than scary in the near end game). I'm definitely glad I played it, though I wish there was an improved, modded, or sequel version. Though, it's movement mechanics and map system will turn off many gamers. Definitely play this if you're looking for exploration, survival and tension.","August 3, 2014","true","17.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like to think I have a decent computer, as it runs both most games very smoothly, yet this game runs like ♥♥♥♥ sometimes.

Exploring the island was kind of neat.  Trying to find all the landmarks and get the entire map to show up is a bit of a challenge on its own.  There's a few buildings scattered around that you'll run into here and there that also have notes in them to give you an idea of what happened since you're all alone and don't have any idea what you're doing there.  I also liked collecting the various plants to craft painkillers and other drugs.  It almost made me wish there were more things to collect and craft than there are.\n\nMy biggest complaint is a possible small spoiler, so I'll hide that next.  I found it kind of tedious once the creature starts showing up.  I was initially kind of excited the first time I saw it.  I tried to hide, but that didn't work out so well since it seemed to home in straight on me.  Pretty much when it first appears, it's not so bad since it only shows up once in a great while, but when you start progressing on your "main quest" it shows up more often.  By the time you're nearly finished with the quest, it's virtually impossible to avoid the thing.  I also had what I'd call worse than 50/50 success in hiding from it too even when I was in a spot that I was completely hidden from it at all times and not making any noise.  I even had a few times that I jammed myself between a tree and the side of a cliff that was completely hidden by leaves and grass and it still kept trying to walk straight at me even though we couldn't see each other (I know where it was walking since I had the skill that tracks the creature when you don't move).  The next small thing is when night falls and you don't have a light source, you're pretty much screwed.  It's completely black and you mostly end up literally rolling down hills on your face and/or falling into the water where you're likely to drown.  You learn real quick not to try going out at night without a torch in hand and another one nearby to take its place.\n\nOverall I found this to be an enjoyable game in spite of the complaints I have above.  It's worth a play through if you like exploring the unknown.","December 31, 2013","true","13.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It does not hold your hand and it does not lead you along a linear path.\nAll in all, 8/10, would reccomend to people who like explorative games, but not to COD-bros.","February 12, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game mechanics are a nice change from many of the overcharged, explosions everywhere variety that glut the market. Not that those aren't fun, but it's nice to find a quiet game that finds its struggle in the little things- how a character navigates a slope without falling to their death, how they cope with a fever, how they deal with an enemy that hunts them but which they cannot defeat. The game mechanics play perfectly into the game's ambiance. These aspects are all the more impressive when you consider that a grand total of two people created this game.\n\nThe best part, though, is the story. The mark of a good tale is in the telling. This game leaves you to piece things together. It's introduced through a number of notes found throughout the island. But not everything is explicitly stated- it's up to you as a player to connect the dots in order to infer what is going on. Few games trust players to do this, but when they do, it's a beautiful thing.","June 19, 2014","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought the graphics were poor, the repetition of tasks irksome,   the fact that  my characters hands remained bloody however many times I  drank from water pools was ( and still is) annoying,  and the tension of trying to find somewhere to rest before dark or before the beast got me was  ever-present on  each new journey. Well... I have  restarted the game several times and, you could say, got used to it now, so my view point has amended. For one thing, I have discovered that the beast can be hidden from, if you are in the right terrain. He is not very bright, or maybe just short-sighted, as just hiding behind a rock near the waters edge works, so I feel there is more of a chance of survival once I hear that heart-beat. The limitation on how many  plant-species you can hold, and how many can be stored is another area of challenge, and I am getting desperate to find a successful match of two plants. All I have is 'one of each' in respect of mental acuity, strength,  agent y possibility, etc and all my six parking bays are full - and I need to  create some more  health boosters as well, so life is not easy! That is the point of the game, I suspect. If it were a breeze we would have lost interest and gone elsewhere before the map was half covered - and I haven't even covered a third of it yet. So, now I recommend it. Look past the minor irritants, try and keep one step ahead of dragon-creature ( why do some call it Milo I wonder?) keep looking for the right plants, and surviving WILL get easier sooner  or later...

The guy basicly lives on medicine and water, and apparently has no pockets to put many items in it.\n\nI also liked the science factor in the game; you pick up plants, examine them and produce medicine. Most of the time, you are given subtle hints and instructions, you discover the rest and it is a pleasant experience.\n\nBUT, map design is both creative and sh*tty at the same time, gives a lot of frustration. Along with that, the character feels like he's on slippery ice; I understand that the developers wanted to deliver a feeling of running out of control down the hill, but it sucks when it happens even on a level surface.\n\nHDR is so extreme, looking at sun makes the whole vision so dark that you feel like you are looking at moon in the night. But the game is graphically inspiring and impressive at times.\n\nAnyway, I could forgive all of the problems, if the game did not ended up crashing and made me waste an hour. I simply don't have the luxury time to play that again. Then I said "Okay, that's it."\n\nI liked the game, I even tried to love it, but couldn't and maybe it's my bad luck.

It seemed like the perfect game for my mood at the time, nothing too heavy or intense, no fiddly controls to figure out or the wonderful task of re-binding keys due to being left-handed!  And what a game it turned out to be.\n\nFor the most part an island exploration simulator, where you wander through valleys, over mountaintops and into dense jungle, Miasmata can be a theraputic, calming experience.  Aside from the task of having to locate and synthesize a number of plants into drugs to cure your character of an unknown plague (admittedly not a relaxing expeience for the guy you're playing), there are no constant swarms of enemies charging towards you or restrictive timeframe placed upon your actions, besides the passing of day into night.\n\nOf course this changes to a degree a certain number of days into the game, when another 'element' is added to the experience, which certainly got my blood pumping on a few occasions!  Having a beast roaming the island with you adds an air of menace to proceedings, as you learn to be stealthier, sneakier or downright panicky in order to esacape its clutches when you cross paths.\n\nIn truth, the beast is only a small part of the joy of Miasmata, as I gained the most pleasure from simply roaming over the terrain, triangulating my way across the map in search of the next hut, piece of vital information, or important plant for examination.  If you have a powerful enough system, the island is a wonder to behold, if somewhat sparse if you are used to running into streams of characters to interact with.\n\nI couldn't recommend this game highly enough, for the time I invested into it.

Exploring the island was kind of neat.  Trying to find all the landmarks and get the entire map to show up is a bit of a challenge on its own.  There's a few buildings scattered around that you'll run into here and there that also have notes in them to give you an idea of what happened since you're all alone and don't have any idea what you're doing there.  I also liked collecting the various plants to craft painkillers and other drugs.  It almost made me wish there were more things to collect and craft than there are.\n\nMy biggest complaint is a possible small spoiler, so I'll hide that next.  I found it kind of tedious once the creature starts showing up.  I was initially kind of excited the first time I saw it.  I tried to hide, but that didn't work out so well since it seemed to home in straight on me.  Pretty much when it first appears, it's not so bad since it only shows up once in a great while, but when you start progressing on your "main quest" it shows up more often.  By the time you're nearly finished with the quest, it's virtually impossible to avoid the thing.  I also had what I'd call worse than 50/50 success in hiding from it too even when I was in a spot that I was completely hidden from it at all times and not making any noise.  I even had a few times that I jammed myself between a tree and the side of a cliff that was completely hidden by leaves and grass and it still kept trying to walk straight at me even though we couldn't see each other (I know where it was walking since I had the skill that tracks the creature when you don't move).  The next small thing is when night falls and you don't have a light source, you're pretty much screwed.  It's completely black and you mostly end up literally rolling down hills on your face and/or falling into the water where you're likely to drown.  You learn real quick not to try going out at night without a torch in hand and another one nearby to take its place.\n\nOverall I found this to be an enjoyable game in spite of the complaints I have above.  It's worth a play through if you like exploring the unknown.","December 31, 2013","true","13.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All criticisms are soft in the head and wide of the mark. There is no other game in existence that has such a complete, intuitive, rich and diverse simulation of nature in the wild. Immense care has gone into creating an edenic island with enchanting wildlife, from beetles, butterflies and frogs through squirrels to fluctuating weather conditions, wild storms and captivating sunsets. It is awesome and perfect by comparison with any other game on the market as of 4th Jan 2014. Some people have found the unrestricted wilderness exploration and cartography irritating or the beast too hard to handle. They collect a couple of plants and seem to get frustrated or bored. Others complain the sea which looks sumptuous as of Dec 2013 is lousy and unprofessional. This leaves me shaking my head in wonder. It's as if these people have become so used to a synthetic gamer's world where conflict is handed to you on a platter in spoon-fed form that when you come upon a game presenting a real life situation with actual bush crashing and navigation skills, even provided with countless prominent features such as the fire pillars and Easter Island heads on every high hill, you can't handle it.

The game can be boiled down to the following: explore the island, collect the plants, construct a map, and create the medicine you need to live. The storyline that accompanies it is novel enough, if very simple, and the gameplay mechanics that start off feeling slap-dash quickly become immersive; if you've ever had a serious flu or fever, you empathize with your clumsy, plague-ridden hero immediately.\n\nI wouldn't say this is a game for everyone, as it's definitely slow-paced and artsy, but for anyone in the mood for a beautifully crafted 3D wanderer (I'm tempted to consider it a Metroidvania-type, but that's just too much of a stretch), then definitely consider shelling out a few bucks and helping a pair of indie programming brothers afford to make more excellent weirdness.","December 12, 2012","true","19.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(In that order of significance) If you enjoy getting lost in Minecraft and finding your way back to your known area, you'll enjoy this game. I'd say its a mix of Minecraft exploration (without dynamic environments or mining, but some crafting), the "LOST" like island mystery, and some Dear Esther visuals and minimal action gameplay.  It also has some Myst elements to it, without the awkward puzzles. There is a cartography element where you need to reference two familiar landmarks (statues etc) to locate yourself and surrounding on the map, and do this with a 3rd new landmark from two different locations to make the new landmark a familiar one. There is a threat on the island, but its hasnt been a big issue for me yet. But my big gripe is the physics of slopes, basically your character struggles to climb even a 5 degree slope, and you can easily fall. Basically it feels like you're wearing roller skates in the wilderness. Also, you have a sickness that constantly requires medicine, so going in water and falling, makes you get sick a lot faster. Good mechanic I guess to keep people from just swiming everywhere. There are also a lot of impassible terrain to get around. So if you're into exploration and mystery, this might be a game for you. But not so much there on the action end, but there are some good survival elements, which can be intense, as you race to make more medicine to survive. One bummer is you only get 1 save slot per game. But all round its something different and fun for those into exploration.","March 13, 2013","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All criticisms are soft in the head and wide of the mark. There is no other game in existence that has such a complete, intuitive, rich and diverse simulation of nature in the wild. Immense care has gone into creating an edenic island with enchanting wildlife, from beetles, butterflies and frogs through squirrels to fluctuating weather conditions, wild storms and captivating sunsets. It is awesome and perfect by comparison with any other game on the market as of 4th Jan 2014. Some people have found the unrestricted wilderness exploration and cartography irritating or the beast too hard to handle. They collect a couple of plants and seem to get frustrated or bored. Others complain the sea which looks sumptuous as of Dec 2013 is lousy and unprofessional. This leaves me shaking my head in wonder. It's as if these people have become so used to a synthetic gamer's world where conflict is handed to you on a platter in spoon-fed form that when you come upon a game presenting a real life situation with actual bush crashing and navigation skills, even provided with countless prominent features such as the fire pillars and Easter Island heads on every high hill, you can't handle it.

It's quite atmospheric, with the lighting and water effects in particular setting the tone, and the sound effects and music are solid.  It feels good to have no HUD and to be flicking through your journals for info instead of menus and holding up your compass instead of following a quest marker. What really sets this game apart is your character's fragility; you can't edge around and up steep hills like in Elder Scrolls games and such, and charging downhill will just cause you to trip and fall. It's a slow-paced game that mostly involves running from place to place, gathering ingredients and charting the island.\n\nHowever, it's all very rough around the edges. The graphics, particularly the textures, are very dated in places. The inventory system (your left hand) is slow, limited and frustrating. Don't expect combat- you can swing a knife around but it won't achieve anything other than looking bad. Ultimately, Miasmata still feels like a demo for a real game, or a sample project, but it's a very promising one. I'd love to see more from these guys- maybe not a polished Miasmata, but a similar adventure game with much higher production values.","March 26, 2013","true","19.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It seemed like the perfect game for my mood at the time, nothing too heavy or intense, no fiddly controls to figure out or the wonderful task of re-binding keys due to being left-handed!  And what a game it turned out to be.\n\nFor the most part an island exploration simulator, where you wander through valleys, over mountaintops and into dense jungle, Miasmata can be a theraputic, calming experience.  Aside from the task of having to locate and synthesize a number of plants into drugs to cure your character of an unknown plague (admittedly not a relaxing expeience for the guy you're playing), there are no constant swarms of enemies charging towards you or restrictive timeframe placed upon your actions, besides the passing of day into night.\n\nOf course this changes to a degree a certain number of days into the game, when another 'element' is added to the experience, which certainly got my blood pumping on a few occasions!  Having a beast roaming the island with you adds an air of menace to proceedings, as you learn to be stealthier, sneakier or downright panicky in order to esacape its clutches when you cross paths.\n\nIn truth, the beast is only a small part of the joy of Miasmata, as I gained the most pleasure from simply roaming over the terrain, triangulating my way across the map in search of the next hut, piece of vital information, or important plant for examination.  If you have a powerful enough system, the island is a wonder to behold, if somewhat sparse if you are used to running into streams of characters to interact with.\n\nI couldn't recommend this game highly enough, for the time I invested into it.

Though discovering new areas, clues to the mystery of the island, and finding new species of flora that will help you maintain your health are all satisfying moments that keep you moving forward.\n\nYour worst enemy is most likely the danger of clumsily navigating steep cliffs or potentially drowing when caught in deep water, yet the silent presence of a single creature stalking you is never to far behind; adding a great sense of tension to the experience.  Also not keeping up your health with rest, medicines, and water, is a sure way to a quick demise.\n\nThe feeling of helplessness being caught lost in the dead of night, waiting for morning to come.  Running and hiding from the island's lone predator while avoiding tumbling off a cliff and not dropping the much needed plant you just found, all wilst keeping your bearings on the nearest safe-haven.  These are some of the intense moments this unique survival game will deliver to you.\n\nThe lack of way-points, weapons, and a traditional HUD, having to brutaly survey your map manually , and "realisic" way the character reacts and moves through movement may drive some gamers away.  But the sum of these parts, I feel, make for a completely unique and refreshing experience.\n\nNot without its flaws, but def one of my personal favorites of the year.

These aspects are all the more impressive when you consider that a grand total of two people created this game.\n\nThe best part, though, is the story. The mark of a good tale is in the telling.

You wake up shipwrecked on a mysterious island, stricken with a feverish disease.  Your goal is to locate and combine the ingredients that will provide the cure.

I can't give it positive or negative review so I'll put positive to help the devs a bit. First off, this game is rather ugly, the textures are nice and that's it. The gameplay is very realistic, but that's where it falls short. The movement is slow and you fall ALL THE TIME, which advances your disease and can kill you. It inhibits your ability to solve the great puzzles the game presents to you. The gathering and puzzles are very good and fun to do.

In any case the game is a unique experience AND a niche game, so its not for everyone plus it has its faults (clipping issues, mapping can be tedious especially in the beginning and some objects like tends just vanish if they are farther away but can still be used as a point for triangulation if you know where they are, some graphics and textures don't look like they belong in because the rest of the environment is so well made and looks really beautiful) but those are only minor issues and didn't spoil my enjoyment in any serious way.\n\nMiasmata lives from its immersive atmosphere when I came home from a trip I made my medicine, studied my journal and map and planed the next tour for tomorrow before I sat down on the edge off a cliff and watched the sunset or the cloudburst over the sea and just enjoyed the world around me.The game for me like for some others was a "slow starter", I didn't really like the first 1-2 hours very much, maybe because I already knew the beginning from lets plays or because I felt so lost without clear cut instructions other than to make the cure and no way to tell were the ♥♥♥♥ I am right now, but as time flew by and I made progress I got slowly sucked into the world of Miasmata. Music plays sparingly but its very soothing and fitting in such situations when you just barely escaped the creature and reached a new safe haven or watch the sun go down from your shack before taking some well earned rest.\n\nThe creature while not particularly smart or scary looking definitely gave me some memorable moments and is really the last thing you want to bump into when you spend your last 15 min mapping and trying to reach an outpost before night sets in. One day I ventured out found two new plants, got a lot of mapping done and forgot about the time so I didn't make it back to my base before nightfall. I got tired of waiting and my water was running out so I decided I will just try to slowly stumble forward through the darkness when suddenly I hear my heart beat. I turned around running as fast as I can before falling down a ridge landing in some bushes. Instinctively I ducked down and in the next moment the silhouette of the creature appeared on the ridge of the hill wandering around before running off.Needless to say I spend the rest of the night cowering in fetal position under my bush praying that Milo doesn't come back. I lost my plants but I survived that night, without water and a fever I dragged myself to a near outpost in the next morning and from that moment on I made sure to always make it home in time. Thats just one example, I had a few more thrilling moments but I will keep those to myself. And just to give you an idea I met the beast around 10-15 times in my 18h of playtime and that was just the right amount to keep it somewhat special.\n\nAfter playing it 76/100 as a neutral rating seems about right when you consider all the minor flaws it has and that it could have been even better with a bit more polish, but my personal rating would be closer to a 90/100 and I would definitely buy it again even at full price.","February 11, 2015","true","20.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not because of some petty tricks to surprise you, but because you will find yourself hunted, while you are so terribly vulnerable and alone, as a sick man without a proper weapon, who can only run.\n\nIf you're into survival, this is your game.\nTwo advice: -Read the cartography manual you'll find ingame. If you don't grasp that mechanic, you won't manage to do it, nor apreciate the game.\n-Think of it as a real adventure.

You do the same thing over and over, but I don't really mind that. I like to alternate between high action games and more low-key discovery/problem solving games. So, in that sense it's a winner. If you like high action, this is not your game. There is a bad glitch I keep encountering more and more. Ocassionally the character freezes up and won't turn right or left.

I am enjoying the problem solving aspect of the game very much. I am close to finishing and can't stop playing. The game is pretty monotonous, though. You do the same thing over and over, but I don't really mind that. I like to alternate between high action games and more low-key discovery/problem solving games. So, in that sense it's a winner. If you like high action, this is not your game. There is a bad glitch I keep encountering more and more. Ocassionally the character freezes up and won't turn right or left.

There were obscure hints to a dangerous beast (TV series "Lost" obsuce).  One of which were weapons, and multiple ways to attack.  Another was danger sense.  There were others too, which I won't spoil.  But what I will spoil is that the beast mechanic is horrible.  There's an "at bay" attack with a specific weapon.  It kinda works, but really janky.  Other attacks do nothing to it.  I've tried a variety of weapons, including blades, thrown and swung, and they do nothing.  The beast moves like one of the worst AI's I've seen, getting stuck easily around obsticles.  It moves slowly whenever I am facing it (seems to move quickly if I turn and run, but I've never seen this).  It's just really scarry until you fight it once, then it's not scarry.  The hide mechanic is horrible, because, while it's usually not hard to hide, it takes agonizingly long for it to patrol away.  If it patrols away at all.  I've stayed ducked in the brush for entirely too long with it just doing the same lap seemingly perpetually.  I've not stayed a day cycle, but multiple in game hours and seen this.  TO MAKE THIS CLEAR: I AM NOT COMPLAINING THAT THE BEAST IS TOO HARD!  I'm complaning that the mechanics of the beast make me really not even want to play any more.  I like the idea of a threat like this, just not how it was executed.  It shoudl require more skill to avoid it, and less patience (patience should be a big part of the experience, but at times infinite patience holding CTRL is too much).  Honestly, the beast got my adrenaline up before I ever encountered it, and now when I encounter it I get a feeling similar to a game bug.  Knowing the experience will completely remove emersion from me, and that if I die, it will feel more like having to restart because of a game glitch than because I played poorly.  The beast needs massively revamped.\n\nThe other problem is with the map.  The way you draw lines while doing cartography, and then how the camera auto zooms for you is frustrating given the number of times you are encouraged to do it.   And I could get past that, but it's an annoying time sync.  What sucks is that 40% of the time I look at the map, it locks mouse movement, which is completely vital to the game.  I can get it back by opening and closing inventory.  But it's buggy, removes immersion, and can lead to problems for your character if you start moving and sliding down something when you expected to mouse turn before the drop, or if you are frantically wayfinding while trying to beat a timer (like potion, night, or stalking beast).  This is flat out buggy.  It shoudl be fixed, but it's the creature that makes me not want to play.  I was still playing a lot in one sitting even with this glitch.\n\nThe terrain and movement.  There are a lot of complaints about the realistic troubles the engine gives you with moving on terrain.  Having done a bunch of hiking myself (not that I'm a pro outdoorsman by any means), a lot of what they simulate is pretty realistic.  But people aren't complaining as much about realism as what's fun for real life isn't necessarily fun for a game.  I agree with that philosophy, but, I do think the realistic terrain dangers are a positive for the game.  Sometimes it's a little jankey feeling, but only a little, and not often.  It's really good and serves the game in my opinion.  Now it would be a horrible feature for your average 1st person shooter, but for this game it'e completely engaging, and I quite enjoy that.\n\nThe premice and story thus far are pretty cool.  I do want to reccomend the game, but for what I said in the first paragraph, I cannot (the second paragraph is stikes against the game, but it's the first paragraph alone that makes me not recommend it).\n\nEDIT:\nI did play the game to completion, and messed around with it a bit more after that.  I forgot to mention numerous rendering issues (vector points stretched in front of the camera constantly, odd strobing that seemed unintentional), but your experience may be different.  Anyways, this game created an experience very unique to itself.  I still don't recommend it mostly because of the beast feels so glitch-y.  But it was a memorable experience, and offered good qualities no other game has.  I will be very interested to see their new game, and will most likely get it.  I certainly think the company is worth keeping an eye on, and I commend them for creating their own experience.  If you are still reading, I hope you have a good idea about if this game is for you.","February 12","false","39.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Luckily you are on an island on which the cure for the plaque was researched.\nAs sick as you are your bodies’ condition isn't good at all. You can't run very far without getting out of breath, swimming is beyond question and falling down a hill becomes a regular thing. After a while (or after falling down) your condition gets even worse and you start having fever. But fortunately there is plenty of plants and herbs that can be manufactured to a temporary medicament against the fever.\nBesides the fever medicament you may also make temporary as well as permanent body enhancement medicaments, which allow you to run faster, to run a greater distance and even to swim.\nRecipes for the different meds just as parts of the story behind the research team are found all over the island on certain campsites.\n\nAs you progress through the island searching for the cure you can't miss the beast, a creature which sole purpose it is to obstruct you. As soon as it hits you your fever worsens and after the second hit you lose you consciousness. There are several possibilities to escape from the beast and you have to escape from it not being able to harm or even killing it.\n\nAnother major part of the game is to triangulate your position and map the island. Without triangulating it is very hard to find your way to different parts of the island so triangulate as often as possible. If you can't find any known landmark and need to know where you are, you can drink a tonic you are able to mix to get temporary the ability to know where you are on the map.\n\nBy finishing the game you might get behind the story of the island, the research team and yourself.\n\nRegarding the graphics:\nIt isn't the best looking game BUT the weather and the different times of day are excellent conveyed. You always get really the feeling that it is as late as it is.

It's not tightly polished, it's fairly simplistic, and it's slow - but it's immersive, challenging, and different than anything I've played.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Using a standard FPS control scheme, you explore an island searching for the cure to a disease which afflicts you. Symptoms manifest themselves in the form of fatigue (you will drown faster while swimming and lose your footing easier when climbing), suffer from blurry vision, and eventually die. You must stave off these effects by crafting medicines out of plans found on the island, of which there are many types, and you have to collect and research each one to see what it does. You also have to drink water, which you can find in ponds, pitchers in cabins, or in your canteen. Dehydration causes onset of the symptoms above. Strangely, and somewhat jarringly, you don't have to eat at all.\nPerhaps the most unique aspect of this game is the navigational aspect. You will find small snippets of maps, but most of the mapping will have to be done manually in the form of triangulation - pinpointing your location in relation to two landmarks (statues, cabins, and tents). It's the largest factor in determining your route, as you will be forced to stay within sight of landmarks. It creates a feeling of helplessness and empowerment simultaneously - you will be walking blind with little clue where to go, until you add a little bit more to your map, which is a great feeling every time.\nYour compass is a vital suplement to the map, as it's easy to become lost. The game doesn't handhold, and when you lose your path, there's little recourse except to take your best guess as to where to go. This is most dangerous when falling, as the screen blurs, you become turned around, and drop whatever items you were carrying. It has the potential to be fatal, especially when in uncharted territory.\nAnother useful tool is your watch, which you must use to ensure you aren't caught in the jungle at night - visibility is extremely limited, to the point where it is almost entirely pointless to travel at night. This is another large factor in determining your travel schedule, as you will want to be in a safe place before nightfall.\nOf course, there's another danger on the island in the form of a monster that stalks the island, against which you are defenceless. It has the potential to throw spokes into your plans, as getting away from it will be paramount - sometimes necessitating flight into unmarked territory.\n\nVISUALS: The game looks very nice. It goes for a realistic style, which looks great for the environment elements - rocks, water, etc. Living creatures look a little stinted, but by no means bad, and certainly not immersion breaking. Reaching the coastline and looking out onto the water is one of the most beautiful parts of this game. While most of the game takes place in nature, there are a few man-made elements that stand out visually - ruins in the jungle, for instance.\n\nAUDIO: Serves the game extremely well. There's a soft ambient soundtrack that underlines the experience, making exploring the island strangely calming, despite the need for survival. Sound effects are great too - perhaps the most memorable being the pulsing and ringing that occurs when taking a fall. A sound you will quickly identify is the pounding of the character's heart when the monster approaches, its intensity indicating the creature's proximity. It's a very quiet game, but each sound serves to add a little something to the experience.\n\nSTORY: The focus is on survival and escaping the island, but there's a tale to be uncovered about the protagonist's past, as well as that of the island - who had been exploring the island and why, and how they came to disappear. It comes off mostly as context for the gameplay, which isn't a bad thing, especially considering the story is satisfying to uncover in all of its little bits and pieces, conveyed almost entirely by optional notes.\n\nThis game is a slow burn, and has challenges unlike those I've seen in other games. Which is why I enjoyed it so thoroughly - it's a chance to explore a beautiful island on your own, and craft strategies for survival. It's hard to say, exactly, what type of demographic I'd recommend this game to - perhaps horror fans looking for a new angle, or those who like exploration games - but I know that I would for sure, as I had a great time with this game.","June 28, 2015","true","16.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Half the time your character walks like a penguin with polio, and as nice as it would be to take a slow waddle through the woods there's no place for that in the beginning of a survival game. While a bit of back-tracking is expected in this genre I found it too awkward to waddle from my home base to wherever I was headed again and again...not to mention only being able to hold one thing at a time, ignoring the pretty, well-designed map they gave you because everything's so close together...I could go on.

The first long while is survival and exploration, and the closer you get to finding the cure, the monster appears more and more often, transitioning into a constant, look-over-your-shoulder horror. The monster itself isn't very scary...but when you can't defend yourself against it at all and you're so close to finding a new drug, that's scary on its own.\n\nEvery new plant I found and researched was like a small achievement deserving a jump for joy, whether it was a simple antibiotic, a temporary boost to my stats, a part of a permanent change to my stats, or one of the key plants needed for the ultimate cure. NEVER have I been more excited about flora!\n\nWhat's bad about it is that there are alot of slippery slopes...literally. Due to the fact that you're traversing this seemingly empty island by foot with a increasingly degrading disease, a small slip could send you tumbling down a small hill, making your sickness worse and on top of dropping all flora you were currently holding. Though they can be found around the area of the fall, if night is quickly approaching, the creature is on the hunt, or whatever reason, chances are you'll have to trek back and pick more up, you clutz. Also, the view of the island is breathtaking, but the characters graphics, which consist of two arms, are glitchy and underdeveloped. You'll see what i mean when you see it.\n\nStart the game and you quickly realized that you are undeniably SCREWED. Finish the game, and feel like a champion for rising above such an imposing challenge.\n\nWorth buying? Yes.","August 25, 2013","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not tightly polished, it's fairly simplistic, and it's slow - but it's immersive, challenging, and different than anything I've played.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Using a standard FPS control scheme, you explore an island searching for the cure to a disease which afflicts you. Symptoms manifest themselves in the form of fatigue (you will drown faster while swimming and lose your footing easier when climbing), suffer from blurry vision, and eventually die. You must stave off these effects by crafting medicines out of plans found on the island, of which there are many types, and you have to collect and research each one to see what it does. You also have to drink water, which you can find in ponds, pitchers in cabins, or in your canteen. Dehydration causes onset of the symptoms above. Strangely, and somewhat jarringly, you don't have to eat at all.\nPerhaps the most unique aspect of this game is the navigational aspect. You will find small snippets of maps, but most of the mapping will have to be done manually in the form of triangulation - pinpointing your location in relation to two landmarks (statues, cabins, and tents). It's the largest factor in determining your route, as you will be forced to stay within sight of landmarks. It creates a feeling of helplessness and empowerment simultaneously - you will be walking blind with little clue where to go, until you add a little bit more to your map, which is a great feeling every time.\nYour compass is a vital suplement to the map, as it's easy to become lost. The game doesn't handhold, and when you lose your path, there's little recourse except to take your best guess as to where to go. This is most dangerous when falling, as the screen blurs, you become turned around, and drop whatever items you were carrying. It has the potential to be fatal, especially when in uncharted territory.\nAnother useful tool is your watch, which you must use to ensure you aren't caught in the jungle at night - visibility is extremely limited, to the point where it is almost entirely pointless to travel at night. This is another large factor in determining your travel schedule, as you will want to be in a safe place before nightfall.\nOf course, there's another danger on the island in the form of a monster that stalks the island, against which you are defenceless. It has the potential to throw spokes into your plans, as getting away from it will be paramount - sometimes necessitating flight into unmarked territory.\n\nVISUALS: The game looks very nice. It goes for a realistic style, which looks great for the environment elements - rocks, water, etc. Living creatures look a little stinted, but by no means bad, and certainly not immersion breaking. Reaching the coastline and looking out onto the water is one of the most beautiful parts of this game. While most of the game takes place in nature, there are a few man-made elements that stand out visually - ruins in the jungle, for instance.\n\nAUDIO: Serves the game extremely well. There's a soft ambient soundtrack that underlines the experience, making exploring the island strangely calming, despite the need for survival. Sound effects are great too - perhaps the most memorable being the pulsing and ringing that occurs when taking a fall. A sound you will quickly identify is the pounding of the character's heart when the monster approaches, its intensity indicating the creature's proximity. It's a very quiet game, but each sound serves to add a little something to the experience.\n\nSTORY: The focus is on survival and escaping the island, but there's a tale to be uncovered about the protagonist's past, as well as that of the island - who had been exploring the island and why, and how they came to disappear. It comes off mostly as context for the gameplay, which isn't a bad thing, especially considering the story is satisfying to uncover in all of its little bits and pieces, conveyed almost entirely by optional notes.\n\nThis game is a slow burn, and has challenges unlike those I've seen in other games. Which is why I enjoyed it so thoroughly - it's a chance to explore a beautiful island on your own, and craft strategies for survival. It's hard to say, exactly, what type of demographic I'd recommend this game to - perhaps horror fans looking for a new angle, or those who like exploration games - but I know that I would for sure, as I had a great time with this game.","June 28, 2015","true","16.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I even checked to make sure it wasn't just my keyboard messing up too. The controls need to be reworked. Holding only two items at a time is rather ridiculous and dropping said items when swimming is also ridiculous. I couldn't have just stuck the knife in the waistband of my pants or something as I swam around?\n\nI did like the fact that when you picked up a note, it pointed out which note you just received in the journal. And the sounds were pretty decent as well.\n\nOverall, would not recommend at all.\n\n","January 5","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Does this game get fun eventually? All I seem to be doing is walking (ice skating?) for miles into the wilderness, getting lost in said wilderness because I can't seem to get the mapping system to work at all, falling off of some cliffs that I was nowhere near in the first place, tripping over on flat ground, finding a plant, and repeating the process over the several mile trek back to the campsite. I don't even need to hunt to hunt or anything that adds any vague interest to the trips, just lots and lots of walking, and lots and lots of falling over. I paid £12 for this.","January 6","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
