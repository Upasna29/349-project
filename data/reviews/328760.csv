Deep combat, huge amount of RPG goodness like classes, crafting, customization, skills, discovery, exploration, and a deep narrative. So much to do. So much love in this game and the DOS-like interface is hardly noticeable. The game is very, very immersive and you grow attached to you characters. The game is deceptiely deep.. literally not one dull moment.\n\nThere is a lot of content in the game. A full playthrough could easily go 10-15 hours.\n\nTherein lies the crappy part - this game is a 1-death permadeath roguelike. Some enemies are very very strong and sort of "come out of nowhere"  and two-shot you (often after a wave of trivial fights). Your characters die rather... unceremoniously... and you get nothing from their deaths.  It's not like other roguelikes where the game is short enough to where it's alright, or you have sort of an "HQ" through which dying at least allowed some sort of gain... you start from square one.\n\nThere is a "softcore" mode... but each death in this mode reduces global item drop rates. That just isn't fun. So much of the game is collecting items and managing them... not an inspiring or fun way to play the game. I don't count that as a decent softcore mode - each time you die the game becomes less fun and more tedious.\n\nEDIT: I WAS WRONG ABOUT SOFTCORE MODE! Each death DOES NOT drop global drop rates. Rather, global drop rates are dropped just once.. at the beginning of the game. Not as harsh. THAT SAID - the reduced item drop rate still is a "punishment" mechanic for choosing an easier difficulty. Further, softcore mode just feels... lame. You die and instantly come back and can enter that exact same fight with a single keypress. In other RPGs with a save system, you at least have to "go through the dungeon" or something similar. There are some stakes on the line for dying - you'll have to climb to the top of the mountain, or whatever. Softcore mode removes the stakes entirely. The game has two extremes - a completely inappropriate die-and-restart-the-entire-15-hour-game, or absolute-0-consequence-for-dying. Neither are compelling to me as a player. Game would be perfect with a Final Fantasy style in-between.\n\nAlso, I know people say "yeah, hard perma-death... that's the fun! that's the point". But I don't know. It doesn't feel right for this game. It's so deep... there is so much joy just from the RPG elements. The game replays every narrative scene on playthroughs.... you slowly unlock gameplay elements EACH playthrough... it's like the game wasn't MEANT to be a roguelike. You end up banging the spacebar through story sequences you've already seen. You end up saltily unlocking skills and gameplay elements that you already have intimate knowledge of ("You've unlocked crafting - here's hw you craft" after having been a craftmaster last playthrough). I feel like the developer jumped on the roguelike train on a game that didn't need to be a roguelike.\n\nThe result of the harsh roguelike set-up with a simply ANNOYING and UN-FUN result is that you grind grind grind to make sure you don't die to an encounter that catches you off-guard. You make your character OP. Still, you may die to a surprise insanely powerful enemy... but maybe not.\n\nAll this bad stuff said - the game is great fun. Well worth 5 dollars. ESPECIALLY if you like challenging rogue-likes and are slightly masochistic... GET THIS GAME. If you just want a great RPG... maybe look elsewhere. This game will frustrate you for being a great RPG that deletes your save when you die.\n\n3/5 (5/5 if not a rogue-like)","February 15, 2015","true","7.9"," 231 of 272 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","231","272","3","15"

I played lots of door games, had a BBS myself, and been active on various BBSes for a good number of years, starting with a 2400 baud modem and going all the way up to 56k, then broadband.\n\nI saw SanctuaryRPG suggested to me, and as soon as I saw the store video, saying this was Steam's first ASCII game, and saw the very nice ASCII graphics indeed, I was sold instantly.

I just bought it.\n\nSo when I tried it, I had the biggest surprise of my life... this game is pure genius.  Only with a text game you could come up with such a brilliant, deep, very deep, combat system.   Yeah, you heard me right, this text game has better combat than all graphic games out there.  And yet, you see nothing of the combat itself.  I won't spoil it, but it's real good.\n\nDon't be fooled, its no rogue-like in the common sense, you aren't a letter on a grid, and move one square at a time, with enemy moving after you.

I must say, it truly is satisfying!\n\nThis game... Wow, how can I put it into words. Honestly, when I first received this game, I was a bit unsure of what to expect. i didn't even know what ASCII means (guess I'm not old enough to be acquainted with the genre). For a guy with over 500 games in his library, I keep coming back to this one every now and then.\n\nSanctuaryRPG is simply put a text-based roguelike loot-centric driven RPG. Featuring harsh permadeaths and surprisingly amount of depth in equipments, abilities and characters, this game is definitely a hidden gem to come out recently! The gameplay mostly requires you to read, enter commands, such as 1, 2, 3, A, S, and read some more. Don't be discourage though, because the developers and writers are definitely a funny bunch! Also, they seem to have an insanely amount of love to potatoes (they should probably get some help about it). Aside from the main story line, there's also dungeon exploration, matchmaking (not really online but with ranks and it decreases over time), fun little tavern management, crafting (never leave home without it!) and a Lunatic mode for those looking for a bigger challenge!\n\nIf you're still worried about the game's playtime duration, don't. Why? Aside from the numerous characters and backgrounds you can choose, the level cap is set (currently) at 300 and the trials (achievments) are insane, requiring to get the highest rank in Matchmaking, encountering 500 random events in the map, etc. Also, it's worth noting that the devs are actively updating the game, adding and fixing in the average once per week. The devs are also very friendly! You can approach them for any enquiries if you want. That's pretty rare these days, no?\n\nI'll probably update this review in the future in case a significant update comes up and I need to put this out. It's been a blast for me to play this and I hope to continue enjoying this masterpiece of an indie game.\n\n\nPersonally, I give SanctuaryRPG a solid 9 / 10!

I love the format and am willing to accept a lot of drawbacks for a good, immersive Roguelike experience. I even put 150 hours into Rogue's Tale, an unfair and punishing Roguelike solely due to how challenging it was.\n\nSanctuaryRPG isn't really a Roguelike, as much as it likes to say it is. It's really just a loot grind.\n\nIs the loot I just found/made better than what I have?\nYes? Equip it. Scrap old item to get more materials to craft loot.\nNo? Scrap it. Get more materials to craft loot.\nRepeat Forever\n\nThe Town Hub could have been a neat idea, but it's too static. Nothing really changes. Go to the Blacksmith every so often to look at more gear. Go to the Market if you need a missing material. Go to the Library for a bit of exp every so often. Go to the campground to dig for loot...\n\nBasically, between the loot grind, go visit each place in the town hub for more loot or exp. Go back and fight random encounters. Repeat forever.\n\nNow, I say forever, but this is where the biggest fundamental flaw of SanctuaryRPG lies: The game is ridiculously easy in such a way that you play on autopilot until you realize you accidentally died because you've been playing on autopilot and you now have to start over.\n\nSure, you can crank the combat difficulty up, but that doesn't seem to do much.\n\nThe combat system is a neat idea and really the only interesting thing SanctuaryRPG brings to the table. There's a combo system and ability system that's pretty interesting. Big points for that piece. But the rest of the game doesn't do anything new or interesting.\n\nOne of the other flaws in the game is that the ramp up, for a roguelike with permadeath, is way too long. I played 2 sessions of this game, both times into Act 2 before autopilot-mistake killed me about 3 hours in. That's way too long for the "introduction" period for a Roguelike. You can take off Permadeath to negate this, however, if you don't play with Permadeath some features of the game are locked down and progression is even slower.\n\nThe story is awful and the humor is just referential. If you're a fan of when a game says, "Hey, look! The cake is a lie! We just made a reference! Aren't we funny and edgy?!", then you'll enjoy the humor in this game.\n\nI wish you could rate a "meh" as opposed to up or down, but I really can't recommend this game.\n\nTl; dr: Diablo-Style loot grind on Hardcore mode that's so ridiculously easy you'll mindlessly autopilot the game until something instagibs you because you weren't paying 100% attention.\n\nHow is that fun?","February 27, 2015","false","6.2"," 90 of 145 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","90","145","0","7"

It's innovative yet keeping within the core practices of old-school roguelikes. Play it for at least 10-15 hours to truly appreciate it. 9/10.\n\nPros:\n-Beautiful ASCII art\n-Wonderful soundtrack\n-In-depthmechanics and gradual learning curve\n-An old-school roguelike that is not a clone of Angband/Nethack/ADOM\n-Funny\n-Good crafting system\n-Solid RPG elements\n-Good replayability\n\nCons:\n-It could do with some more content and rebalancing\n-The story is a bit lacking\n-The encounters (events) can get a bit too random\n\nPossible caveats (i.e. things you might either love or hate):\n-Absolutely unforgiving (in non-softcore modes)\n-Repetitive combat (it's a design choice, but it can get frustrating)\n-The community is rather small\n-Very different from Angband/Nethack/ADOM, and somewhat less in-depth\n-No new-school roguelike progression (a la Rogue Legacy), but progressing in the game will unlock new options\n-It has a weird obsession with potatoes\n\nDetailed review:\n\nSanctuary RPG is an ASCII roguelike that does not follow the steps of Angband/ADOM/Nethack, so if that is what you are expecting you might be disappointed. The exploration is done via menu choices, rather than moving your character around a map, and so is the combat, dialogue, and pretty much everything else. The immersion is achieved, instead, through some rather stunning ASCII art, an absolutely outstanding soundtrack, and various interactions with enemies and NPCs. The game mechanics, and various menus, are complex enough to keep things interesting throughout the game, but not so much to become overwhelming; this is also achieved by new features, skills, and areas becoming gradually available as your character levels up.\n\nIf what you are missing, however, is the unforgiving nature of old roguelikes, then look no further. Sanctuary RPG looks deceptively friendly at first, with its light humour and digestible chunks of text, but the moment you get distracted or overconfident, you're dead, no mater how overpowered you felt ten seconds ago. The game is rather difficult to master, not because the underlying mechanics are complicated, but because you have to be very careful with all your decisions, just like in any old roguelike worth its salt. I have played it for over 20 hours and never managed to get past act 2. For those looking for a less frustrating experience, the game also has a softcore mode, with reduced loot drops and no permadeath.\n\nAs some reviewers have mentioned, the combat does get a bit repetitive, again, like in any old-school roguelike, and that is exactly how most of my characters meet their untimely demise: I get distracted and miss a crucial step to heal or use an ability. This is a design choice, I believe, and one I understand and accept, however much it frustrates me to lose my precious wizards to it again and again.\n\nSome of the text could do with a spell check, but there are no major grammatical mistakes, just a couple of sentences here and there that sound a bit odd. As much as the content has grown and been improved over the last year or so, I would love to see more dialogue choices for the NPCs you meet in every adventure, as those get a bit old after a while and lack depth. I also feel that some of the randomly generated loot needs a bit of a rebalance, but that may also be a design choice to prevent characters from getting too strong too quickly.\n\nI think my main gripe is with the small size of the community that plays this game. It is very difficult to find guides, and even the wiki is barely there. As such, it is rather difficult to compare strategies with other players. Many players seem to abandon this game after a few hours, which I think isn't anough to fully appreciate it. And while it is fun, and in-theme with the old-school roguelike vibe (I didn't have walkthroughs for Angband back in the 90s!) to discover the game by trial and error, sometimes it also gets a bit frustrating.\n\nAll in all, however, I truly love this game. It's balanced, it's fun, and it's unforgiving in a very familiar way, while also being surprisingly innovative. If any of its elements appeal to you, you can't go wrong for that price, give it a chance. And get the soundtrack too! :)","December 20, 2015","true","30.4"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","2"

Buy it.\n\n- SanctuaryRPG is RPG in its core form. You get right at the stats, drops, and builds that makes RPG... RPG. No fancy UI interfaces get in the way. It is in the title of the game. RPG. RPG. RPG.\n\n- Feature to turn off dialog exists if you find it too annoying.\n\n- It is text, it takes seconds to get in to battle from startup. This makes it perfect for both casual and in-depth gaming sessions.\n\n- You die, game over. Each battle plays out in different ways. Working several hours on a toon to only die because you didn't pay attention in battle... sucks! (You can turn off perma-death if you want. It is more exciting with it on, and the drops are better.

It is ludicrously powerful, seemingly possible for any enemy, and even if you ONLY upgrade vitality it can and will kill you at full life in one hit.\n\nIf I'm going to lose I want it to be from the game, not just hyper trample. It's a dinner plate sized blemish on the face of a game that is amazing in nearly every other way. Until this type of attack is overhauled, it changes the whole game to focus around making damn well sure you attacked in the right rhythm to be able to dodge it, and if you can't or if you are snared, then you instantly lose everything you've ever worked for. Period. The game in its current form revolves around avoiding this singular mechanic far and above anything else, and it trivializes the game in its entirety.\n\n*Edit*\n\nThe game has been patched since I wrote the above review, and although hyper trample still poses a massive threat there are now more appropriate means of mitigation. That being said, even later in the game when you are decked out it won't be uncommon for it to hit for 50% of your health. But at the very least you can eventually achieve the ability to not die in the event you are forced to tank a hit from the attack.\n\nDue to the dev's close attention to the issue and the fact the game is utterly fantastic in every other quality, I would consider this game worth buying despite a few of the more annoying combat mechanics.","December 14, 2014","true","35.6"," 30 of 46 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","30","46","0","0"

Once you're familiar with the commands you can finish fights and visit locations in an instant. You almost play the game on automatic at this point.

Like many of my Steam purchases, I was fully prepared for this to entertain me for a single play session and to be quickly forgotten. I was not prepared for how immediately engaging this game would be.\n\nDIFFICULTY\nI continually feel rewarded by the frequent leveling and item drops. I was never in any doubt that my character was growing increasingly more powerful with every action taken, and I've never felt the need to grind levels or gear. Despite this being true across my playthroughs, the game never allows me to be careless. Any encounter could easily result in my death which, in Classic mode, is permanent. For me, there is a perfect balance between reward and challenge in this game.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nIn addition to advancing the story, there are various side tasks that can be performed often, but not constantly, including crafting, management, fetch quests, and battles. I did not ignore any of these since they provide experience and offer a nice diversion. I'm not sure if the core gameplay might become a bit monotonous if I ignored all of these side tasks.\n\nLENGTH\nI have not succeeded in beating the game yet, but I'd estimate that an average, successful playthrough would take 2-4 hours depending on familiarity with the game mechanics and progression. Keep in mind though that this estimate is based on the assumption that I've made it to the final encounter of the game.\n\nSTORY & WRITING\nIt's too soon for me to accurately say, but the story seems to be entirely linear. This could be considered a negative to some due to the game's length and permadeath feature. A softcore game type is option, but this seems to prevent unlocking some game options. In my opinion though, the story is very well written and there likely would have been a quality drop if it had been branching or randomized. The flavor text that is included with battles and other interactions has been entertaining and varied enough to me to keep me looking forward to reading it.\n\nSOUND\nI appreciate the retro-inspiration and found the music to be very, very enjoyable. Sound effects are about what I expected, though there are situations where a battle end sound effect seems to be missing, which briefly takes me out of the experience.\n\nREPLAYABILITY & VALUE\nOnce I beat the game, I'm not sure if I will immediately start playing with a new class or if I will move on to another game, but I know that I'll have enjoyed every hour spent during that playthrough and would gladly pay $7.99 again if I had to do it over.\n\nUpdate on game length: I completed Act 3 in about 3.5 hours as a Barbarian. I assumed this would be the end of the game. There is an Act 4, but it felt more like post-game than a continuation. I, admittedly, did not live much longer though, so it's possible that I just didn't progress the story yet. I ended up dying during "Ranked Matchmaking" at the Colosseum.","February 17, 2015","true","12.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

It's not an identical experience to any of those things, but it blends elements of all of them to create something far more entertaining than you can convey with screenshots and videos.  For example, you wouldn't expect the battle mechanics to be very complex, but I found myself having to think about my next action more often than not.  There's no one thing that you can mash to always win, and that's a kind of balance that you don't see in many turn based RPGs.  The ASCII art is also surprisingly dynamic - you will see a good amount of motion in this game that doesn't come across at all in screenshots.\n\nIf I really had to pick a negative out, the HP numbers are very large and damage has a pretty wide range of fluctuation right at the start.  It makes it a bit hard to make a snap judgment on how effective a given attack was and slowed down my turns a little.  But that's a pretty minor issue, and if the worst problem with a game is big numbers, I call that a pretty solid game.\n\nIf you were interested enough to read this far into the review, grab the demo and try it out.

A quirky, ascii, encounter driven RPG with an actual decent story, good characters, a great sense of humor, and just a charm and finesse that really hit home.\n\nThe best way I can describe this is like I just got passed a shareware disk (with a k), and it had 5 random things on it that were quickly forgotten, and then this one other crazy game in there that head-lines the collection and suddenly you find its hours and hours later and you are still playing.\n\nIf you like quirky/original takes on nostalgic genres and art styles, by all meand give this one a try.  Its the rare gem that is really way more than you were expecting and can tie you up for hours and hours with just raw mechanics and gameplay (since being a turn based ascii rpg, gameplay is basically the main focus).","May 12","true","19.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

When i got the game i was not expecting much except some nostalgic ascii goodness i grew up with during the dial-up BBS hey days of the 90's. Turns out the game consists of a deep  game engine/combat-engine coated with really retro text-ui. Basically it seems to me that the devs - who have obviously played the classics just decided to make a game that pays homage to old classics and also make to it 'the best there is' using modern technology but still make it look like it's a old game. And by that i mean menus and everything are retro but all works smoothly - unless it's supposed to move sluggishly. Also the rich sound world in the background betrays the fact this game is no retro technically.\n\nSo should you buy it? Depends. Rogue-like players will like it but as some players have pointed out the joke-like nature of encounters and certain linearity will wear you down in the longer run. Game will require some stamina from the player. things are revealed in time and the pacing is slow.\n\nHowever if are you just curious what the game is like then get it right away. It's price is not bad and easily worth it. It simply a unique game in my library - there is no other game i can directly compare this to and i do have a pretty decent set of roguelikes.\n\nMany weird wtf moments with this game. For me just the surprise elements i have encountered during the first 10 hours and the constant finding of new things has kept the game very fresh. And i have only tried two classes as of yet. At 10 hours i am still curious over what i will find next.\n\nGame claims to be the "world's first fully-ASCII game to grace the Steam platform," and things look right now this game will put the bar very high for late comers.","April 8","true","12.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

The only thing to recommend it is the basic design of the combat system, which is decently solid. The rest of the game plays like a satirical take on Free to Play games. That is, the whole game is variations on the theme of "make the player waste their time jumping through UI hoops to earn tiny incremental rewards." Just about everything in this games takes at least 6 button-presses more than it should, maybe so that it can provide the illusion of variation in gameplay where there is none.\n\nPros:\n+ Decent basic combat system.\n\nCons:\n- Designed to make you press as many buttons as possible to accomplish as little as possible.\n- The whole game is just one giant grindfest. Even non-combat activities are designed to to take many pointless steps.\n- Insanely linear. No exploration. You just select "Continue on in plot" from the menu.\n- Permadeath starts EVERYTHING over from the beginning.

You start of this game creating a character. Selecting between various races/classes/weapon styles and more. After that you'll select between hardcore mode (die once and you lose your character) or casual mode. Then your adventure starts into this wacky ascii world filled with enemy encounters, silly dialogue and lot of random loot. Just like in Diablo you will get that feeling of glee when you find another epic or even legendary piece of equipment.\n\nGraphicly the game is .. text based. I grew up past the whole textbased era of games but for it only being text it looks good. For me it doesn't add or detract anything to the game.\n\nThe music is a great feature of this game. Every tune just fits the scene. For example the blacksmith theme has a blacksmith hammer clanging with the tune and it sounds awesome. There are a lot of various battle themes (all of them sound great) which is important because you will be battling 80% of your time in the game.\n\nOne of the things I disliked about the game was how you lose all progress when you die. Ofcourse that's normal in a roguelike game, but deaths can be very random and the game isn't short. I got past act 1 on a 2,5 hour play session, was feeling very strong only to die by a random encounter. After you restart you get the slow unlocking of abilities and story arc again and they are the same every time, so that can get a bit tedious.\n\nI haven't finished the game yet, don't know if I ever will (random stuff can and will kill you eventually, it seems) but what I have played so far is a lot of fun and I can feel the passion that creators have put into this project.","February 20, 2015","true","12.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Set your nostalgia back to the 80s because Sanctuary returns us to the days of IBM floppy disk playstyle, but adds all the swish new techniques of today's slickest MUDs.\nThe RPG elements are top notch and more often than not innovative over today's AAA games.  The character class combinations are incredibly fun.  The system is easy enough to understand, so one is never bogged down with endless cumbersome keyboard commands.  The controls make sense, are to the point, displayed on the screen and turn-based, so you can learn at your own pace.  The risk factor makes the game feel very realistic and often even frightening.  Charming townspeople and chilling dungeons alike await intrepid adventurers.  The music is wonderful and worth buying as a DLC.  It evokes feelings of old Nobuo Uematsu fantasies with lots of crunchy nintendo blip goodness.  The graphics may seem simple, but they are incredibly complex and beautiful.  Just try to draw these yourself!  Every monster and treasure is well rendered in ASCII and better than 3D graphics in this case, as it allows the player to imagine a fair amount of the world as well.\nCrafting is great.  Quests are enjoyable.  The fightng is damned fun.  The limit break system is dynamic and carries over across battles.  Stored TP can then be used for difficult battles, opening up with that devastating special attack.  That's just one small example of how complex the battling is.  All the while, it never gets hard to control, overwhelming, or confusing...  but don't go thinking this roguelike holds yer hand, it does not.  The player is soon plunged into a world of danger & excitement.  I fear for my characters' lives.  Their experiences feel very real.\nBlack Edition is wicked & well polished.  Worth buying again.\n\n10/10 - Better RPG than Skyrim.\n\n(playtime also on Desura & inaccurate)","September 5, 2015","true","1.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

I'm also deliberately reviewing it low in the playtime so I can cleanly state the facts as a fresh player, without the bias more hours would bring.\n\nWhat's the game like? Well simply put, its an old skool RPG Rogue-Like tactical combat game. It has the feel of an old adventure game from the 80s meshed with a TBS from the 90s, a sort of cross between a Rogue and Final Fantasy, with a hint of Douglas's adams Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy for whimsy and charm and a 1st person Ultima game played in ASCII first person for the map. The mix of games sounds like a mess, it should not work, but in reality it holds together well as you have an interesting non-cliche RPG story with humour and a quest to finish, but is fleshed out with other elements like crafting, town base building by using cratables to upgrade the town, random procedual generated dungeons on the map and in the arena in town, all of which ties into the whole experince.\n\nIf you are a fan of the old school, early 90s rogue likes and your ultimas and final fanstasy games, please buy this game, as it has this vibe in spades. Also would highly recommend buying if your interested in combat tactics and not just pressing 1 to cast spell or 2 to drink potion, as like MMORPGS and some offline RPGS, your number keys do your class actions (of which there are many) but there is quite alot going on screen at any point, and any tactical errors such as forgetting to heal when bleeding out in one of the rounds, or forgetting to dodge at certain points will lead to death.\n\nIn terms of downsides, it does get hard later in the game and you really do need to know how your class skills interact and behave to survive later on and not be dispatched in quick order (but this may also be seen as a positive) and there may be some intitial getting used the interface needed as there is alot going on the screen per turn and when wandering around landscapes and towns, but if you willing to stick with it you get used to the ASCII style quickly.\n\nIn summary it's a game that is packaged in a unique, old skool style but it's one that understands the flows of a more modern tatical TBS game while not sacrificing what it means to be old skool in the first place, presented in great quality. That last scentence may not make sense unless you play it, but it is as it is.","December 13, 2014","true","4.0"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","10","17","0","0"

This game has excellent design and lots of nice easter eggs and references and I hope the developer puts more of them in the game considering it's still on Early Access.\n\nThe gameplay is extremely simplistic, you'll choose one of the available options and type it in the prompt and hit enter, then pretty stuff will happen. But don't let simplicity fool you, for this game is rich and has tons of nice  features for you to tinker with, like crafiting and salvaging, bartending and mining, and a well-made battle system with a lot of possibilities to influence the outcome of the battle.\n\nYou can choose the appearance of character, gender (3 options, for some it's important so hooray to the developers), name, class, race and then the adventure will begin. But considering it is a roguelike game (there is an option to play without permadeath) I wouldn't get too attached to my carefully created character. But fear not, for after you die a horrible death you can always create another and you'll be wiser and that's the beauty of the roguelikes.\n\nI didn't play it that much yet, but I can assure you that if you like games that have a spoon of funny, ASCII art, RPG mechanics, crafting mechanics all bundled up in a nice simple package that you can play basically on any computer, then you'll have invested your hard earned money in a real work of art.

It also has a catchy and enjoyable soundtrack.\n\nThe central gameplay loop does seem monotonous, albeit instantly familiar:\n\n1. Kill things.\n2. Level up; find randomised loot.\n3. Repeat, watching your numbers increase, until you can take on the boss of the current Act.\n4. Kill the boss.\n5. Proceed to the next Act and repeat.\n\n(This is occasionally interrupted by inconveniently dying, cursing at the screen, and rolling a new character—or, on Softcore difficulty, respawning with 0 gold and 0 EXP. Also, there are a few side activities that produce EXP and loot with varying amounts of player effort, but they are of course only temporary distractions from the main loop.)\n\nBut hey, if the game were only as boring as I just made it sound, I wouldn't be recommending it. So, here's why I'm addicted to this silly and engrossing game:\n\n1. The combat system instantly grabbed me. Chaining attacks creates combos, which raise the multiplier for your ult. You can (and should) reposition yourself to put distance between you and the enemy, to break their guard, to dodge an attack with a lead-up, or to thwart their missile lock-on. Oh, wait—they ensnared you? Cut yourself free. They wounded you? You'll have to heal or you won't be able to reposition as effectively. They poisoned you? Too many poison stacks and you'll go blind. And there's so much more to it than I can describe here. It's thrilling; looking at the combat screen and entering commands, I can't help but feel like a wizard.\n\n2. The music is surprisingly good and goes beyond what one would expect from a game with these visuals. The battle themes in particular are stuck in my head.\n\n3. The writing and enemy design ranges from silly meta humour to lightly engaging adventure-drama. I want to see what stupid random event will pop up, just as much as I want to see what happens next in the (semi-)serious story.\n\nTo give a more personal testimonial: I got someone hooked on this game, despite his dislike for typing and reading walls of text. The combat gameplay and the music won him over. That's a real triumph in my book.\n\nGo ahead and give the demo a whirl!","February 25","true","6.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, I do take issue with the fact it is advertised as a roguelike, when it isn't in any real meaningful way.\n\nIf there was a "possibly recommend" option, I'd pick that.

Set your nostalgia back to the 80s because Sanctuary returns us to the days of IBM floppy disk playstyle, but adds all the swish new techniques of today's slickest MUDs.\nThe RPG elements are top notch and more often than not innovative over today's AAA games. The character class combinations are incredibly fun. The system is easy enough to understand, so one is never bogged down with endless cumbersome keyboard commands. The controls make sense, are to the point, displayed on the screen and turn-based, so you can learn at your own pace. The risk factor makes the game feel very realistic and often even frightening. Charming townspeople and chilling dungeons alike await intrepid adventurers. The music is wonderful and worth buying as a DLC. It evokes feelings of old Nobuo Uematsu fantasies with lots of crunchy nintendo blip goodness. The graphics may seem simple, but they are incredibly complex and beautiful. Just try to draw these yourself! Every monster and treasure is well rendered in ASCII and better than 3D graphics in this case, as it allows the player to imagine a fair amount of the world as well.\nCrafting is great. Quests are enjoyable. The fightng is damned fun. The limit break system is dynamic and carries over across battles. Stored TP can then be used for difficult battles, opening up with that devastating special attack. That's just one small example of how complex the battling is. All the while, it never gets hard to control, overwhelming, or confusing... but don't go thinking this roguelike holds yer hand, it does not. The player is soon plunged into a world of danger & excitement. I fear for my characters' lives. Their experiences feel very real.\nBlack Edition is wicked & well polished.

I also expect a great future from Black Shell Media because the devs communicate with the consumers a lot, they update their games a lot & they take feedback seriously so that's another reason you should buy their games.","February 26, 2015","true","4.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The old version is still fun, but this one is even better!\n\nI am so happy this game was greenlit. I purchased it originally from the dev a while back, and its a game that I am proud to have supported.\n\nSanctuaryRPG takes a page from the old ASCII BBS games such as LORD and Exitilus. It is a work of ASCII art, proof positive that you dont need cutting edge graphics to make a great game. Each scene is rendered in ASCII art, and in cases there are hidden areas you can get to by pressing a key corresponding to a letter hidden in the picture. And its well-done ASCII art too.\n\nIt also has some of the best chiptunes to come out of a game in recent years. The music is just *awesome*. The fight music is probably the song I like the best. It really captures being in front of your NES, on the final boss that it took you hours and hours to get to.\n\nThe gameplay is simple. And like I said earlier, is reminiscent of the old BBS games. Its entirely keyboard driven, You wander from area to area, fighting monsters, exploring, travelling, and following the story. Random events happen as you "travel" - each area has a level. Going there triggers a fight (mostly), item drop, or random event.. These could be anything from an NPC, some loot, a story event, or even a secret area if you happen to find it on the map. To get from place to place - you press a key from a list. Theres hidden areas too. On the ASCII map, say theres an X in a door. Well you'd press X to go that way. Theres plenty of hidden places if you look for them.\n\nCombat, as the rest of the game is keyboard driven. You see your enemies health, and yours, a list of about 5-8 different things you can do, and a basic status of the enemy. There are plenty of options to choose from, and you can link diffrent combos and finishing moved together by expirimenting with the combat options. You also get overkill moves by accumulating rage points, or the enemy may gain a status buff/debuff or put one on you, causing you to have to break its guard, heal your bleeding, and so forth.\n\nHowever, fighting can get repetitive after a while. At least with the class I was playing, the same combo pretty much always worked, so I was just grinding through enemies over and over. Boss fights were a different story, and kept you on your toes as you switched your tactics constantly.\n\nThe possibility of fights becoming a bit grindy one of the few (admittedly minor) downsides, and my version was much older than this one, so it may have been changed.\n\nThe game is humorous, with plenty of gamer jokes and amusement, but it never feels like its beating you over the head with the silly factor . Its also suprisingly complex. Theres an arena, crafting (the crafting mechanic is really fun!), quests, and all kinds of random other stuff to keep you occupied when you need a break from the fights.\n\nIf you love ASCII art, get this game. If you love chiptunes, get this game. If you remember the BBSes, get this game.  Unless of course you demand fully rendered graphics and voiceovers with a minimap to point out exatly where you need to go and a million hints to hold your hand along the way...","December 16, 2014","true","21.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

SanctuaryRPG had good reviews, and always a stickler for everything RPG I bought it for the low price of 4.99.  Next thing I know I've been playing for an hour and a half and enjoyed every minute of it.  This can certainly be called a text based game, in some sense, due to the ASCII graphics- which is a good thing because of the graphics. There also isn't a lot of hand holding, but the various help/guides deliver what you need to know without giving to much away.  I really don't know what to expect at each turn.  This makes it a great exploration game.  I thought I was turning in a quest...next thing I know I'm an owner an operator of my very own bar- a profitable one too!  Minutes later I'm stabbing a doctor in the face because I don't want to hear him talk anymore.\n\n-Great game, can't wait to keep exploring\n-Great 8 bit sound effects and music\n-complex combat system\n-Early into it, but I can tell the character development is well thought out.  Though I haven't had any problem with the enemies yet, i hope the character / skill building is a crucial meta-game for winning.\n\nFor 4.99 I couldn't receommended it enough.

It only took me a few minutes to really notice a lot of the new changes in the game for the Black Edition, and thus far nothing I've seen has displeased me. Sanctuary is a game that pays devoted respect to the sprawling text-based adventures of old, but has the personality and depth of modern RPGs, with wonderfully humorous writing and lots of tiny references that make old-school gamers smile.\n\nGranted, the game isn't going to be for everyone-- not everyone is going to be thrilled with the difficulty level (this game does not hold your hand), and many will be put off by the text-only controls. For those who prefer something of the old flavor, however, they'll find hours and hours of joy in this game, with its gear crafting, development, combat depth, character customization, and more.\n\nAbsolutely worth the price-- and the active role that the developers play in the further growth of the game is evident.

I remember playing the  game Ancient Domains Of Mystery (ADOM) as a teenager and absolutely falling in love with it.  Sancturary and ADOM are different beasts, except in their ASCII graphic style and their storytelling/dialogue that absolutely draws you in, as, well as their roguelike qualities.  But it's what they share that makes them so equally loveable.\n\nI won't pretend to completely understand ASCII or the ASCII art and graphic style, although you can find fascinating information about both on wikipedia.  All I know is that this art style and the ability to create pictures and the like from it is truly impressive.  Between the ASCII art, the programming made to create the game, and the creativity in the game world itself this game is absolutely worth 5 dollars if not more.\n\nRandom encounters, permadeath (only if you want it), multiple choices in every situation, random story and scenario situations ala roguelikes, mining, crafting, weapon/armor gambles, great soundtrack,  funny dialogue, engaging yet easily accesible combat, leveling, secrets, progression, etc, etc.\n\nthis game really has a lot to offer and for over 10,000 hours put into its making I feel like 5 dollars is an incredibly reasonable price.\n\nJust for reference the lead developer gave me a steam key for this game since i obtained the earlier version in a few bundles before it was on steam.  But honestly this game is so good i plan on buying it for at least two other people before the christmas season ends.  The developers for this game are absolute gentleman and they deserve as much praise as they can get!\n\nPlease upvote this if you agree that this game is amazing and/or if you would like to show the developers your appreciation!

When I say oldschool I don't mean pixels hitting pixels, I mean text based rpgs. If you want to try playing a D&D game alone? This is a pretty good attempt at it. If you don't enjoy text based games then skip over this one. Personally this was a miss because I am not from the age of text based games. I can only rec this to people who enjoy text based games. It also slightly feels like a tower climb rpg.","December 27, 2014","true","1.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You will not be dissapointed. Don't let the graphics or mention of ascii fool you. I love rouguelikes, but am not a fan of '@' games. This is not an "@" game. This is more of a text based adventure(kind of similar to the ios game "A Dark Room") where you find yourself asking questions about pototoes and urine, and getting your exposed crotch smashed by a skeleton's axe.\n\nPros:\n-Gameplay is simple, yet complex. You can spend you time in the mines digging ore to craft weapons, or maybe spend some time in your tavern serving beers hoping to get tipped good items. You can go fight monsters in multiple places, or follow the "main" quest. There doesn't seem to be any limit on how much you can level up an any area, so knock yourself out.\n-Items. The weapons are random and endless. There are like five types of weapons, and I have never seen any duplicates. They all have random modifiers, and there are many variations of the weapon types.\n-Funny. Everything in this game is hilarious. I love dying so I can start a new charactor and laugh my ♥♥♥ off reading their bio. I never thought I would laugh so hard at a text based adventure, but I did, and still do.\n-Music. The music is awesome. It's like old 8bit video game but modern and catchy. Sound effects are present as well and are also very well done.\n-Combat. It's so easy you'll die continuously. Just use the numpad, and pay attention to the combat modifiers.\n\nCons:\nI litterally cannot think of anything that I don't like about this game. This isn't a steam sale game. You will actually play this, so just buy it right now and shutup.\n","February 10, 2015","true","6.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I've never really played any ascii type games, except when I was too young to remember them, but I thought I'd give this one a go based on all the positive things people have said about this game, and I am 100% glad that I did!\n\nFirst of all, there is so much to do, so many little quests, bounties and even the management of the tavern if you play your cards right. All of the random encounters, hilarious and often nonsensical slices of humour thrown in here and there really make this game feel so much fun. You'll find dialogue such as "A potato has decided to follow you around." to something terrifying funny like "The worm defecates in your ear."\n\nThe ascii art work is very polished and looks as though it has had a lot of love put into it. It's charming and simple.\n\nThe gameplay, from character creation to the immense replayability and even the combat system, reminds me of one of my favourite games of all time: Tales of Maj Eyal, it has that similar feel of even if you lose, you just want to start over and try again immediately, which is an essential element to the rogue-like genre. Starting over in this game doesn't feel like a chore, because it's different each time and every character you play. There is so much loot which really is part of the glue that holds everything together, making every run through a unique and challenging experience.\n\nThe combat system is very intuitive and unique. There are a whole bunch of different skills and combos which makes the combat a real edge of your seat sort of affair, but if you play your cards right, and you take your time and are meticulous with your decisions, it will leave you feeling incredibly satisfied after a challenging fight.\n\nOverall, I have yet to discover anything negative about this game, I love every feature and every bit of text is a delight to read. For an ascii game, it is more engaging than a lot of the games in my library, I recommend it 100%!\n\nAlso, do not be fooled by the early access sticker, because this game is very polished and clearly a very loved project by the incredibly talented developers.

There's plenty of humor and nods to prior classics and while the game is text-based (and super fast!) there are ASCII graphical elements that bring the game alive.  The combat system is fluid with turn-based actions that chain together to unlock damaging finishers, along with moves that will deal damage to your foe and heal yourself, saving your Heals for better uses.  My first character, in full roguelike mode (which they call Classic; a multi-life mode is available) and with luck from some good drops, has survived to Level 7 with very exciting game play -- I found the game immediately enjoyable and addicting.

Some of the battle music is really awesome too. I also love the aspect of randomized dungeon crawling and the amount of loot they have for a game like this. The story maybe be silly, but the developers were serious. Deffinatley worth the 8$","March 9, 2015","true","25.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Brilliantly detailed and deep gameplay. The UI may seem a little impenetrable at first, but is surprisingly intuitive. There's so much to do, in addition to the main storyline, there's a million little things to do whenever that gets boring, all kinds of enemies in the colosseum, a tavern to manage, a store to make investments at (yes, the store is a place to MAKE money, not just spend it), the library, temple, everyone gives a quest, it goes on and on. Even after 10 hours I feel like I've only scratched the surface and I'm not bored yet.\n\nMy only complaint is the roguelike nature and long intro to the storyline don't mix well. The first 5-10 levels of each character are a bit monotonous.  Also, the classes could feel a little different, for the most part when I'm actually fighting, the classes feel the same, the moves just have different names. I'm just mashing the same key combos (2, 1, 3, 3, repeat) for the easy fights on each class.\n\nOverall though, highly recommend.","April 17, 2015","true","19.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game proves my mantra that I would rather have a great game with minimalist graphics that great graphics on a minimalist game.\n\nThe combat mechanics might be a bit repetitive but it does help to pay attention since it is quite dynamic and you can do extra attacks or moves depending on the current situation at hand, plus you can always reposition yourself for a better chance to hit hard.\n\nI can't comment on the story since I died to early ahead for things to get interesting... although if I do have a gripe is that the randomness inserted in the game can get very juvenile, I don't mind the lolrandom type of humor but maybe do keep a lid on the potty jokes.\n\nAnd speaking of the game it is hard although I usually find it me basically being on autopilot and ignoring certain things like thinking I could eventually dodge a charging enemy and delay a dodge only to find out that I am out of MP to heal myself.\n\nI really do love the loot system and the simple crafting system as well, it does get a bit hard to get what you want exactly which is a bit frustrating that you want to use swords only for the game to constantly give you axes and bows, not that you are too handicapped if that happens just that the randomness might not work out for you.\n\nOne thing that I do gripe is that they did add a lot in this new version but there is nothing to show what you can actually do. If you are an old player jumping in new make sure you go to old places again so you don't miss any new stuff.\n\nThis game is awesome, I can reccomend it at the $5 asking price, in fact I got the key from donating a lesser ammount to the developer before but after playing this game I went back to his page and donated a couple more bucks to show that he definetly did a good job.\n\nIf you are on the fence about buying the game then allow me to push over the buy side of the fence then.","December 15, 2014","true","5.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FromFearRises/recommended/328760/","FromFearRises","FromFearRises","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FromFearRises/","96 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDo you like rogue likes and text based graphics?\n\nThis is Sanctuary RPG and as you can see by the graphic above, it is not your typical rogue like or your typical text based adventure. This indie game is being (yes, it is still undergoing further development though it is essentially done) developed by a group called Black Shell Media. If I could describe this game simply, it is a multiple choice rogue like RPG with text based graphics. To play the game, you basically enter a number or letter corresponding to an action or location. You start as a (class of choice, race of choice) type deal, where each class has their own story beginning with plenty of witty and sometimes not at all subtle humour (the range character's story has something about sticking sharp things in bushes, some dirty humour like that). You then go on your quest which I will talk about later and do all amazing things with lots of jokes, including one about breaking the fourth wall, and progress until you come to your demise where the game will end and you will have to start from scratch. You have two base modes (normal and softcore which you can't die in but have 20% less loot drops). After you complete the game you then get harder game modes with better loot drops. Also there is something in the start screen about a character option which can only be changed from the default (potato) by finding the ultra rare drops of them in the game, so lots of replayability.\n\n\nShocker! This isn't going to melt your PC or need a GTX Titan Z to run. The aesthetics are nice and simple, but really suit the game. It has that retro feel of some of the first games, but with more colour and more detail. I admittedly was a bit sceptical when I first saw it because it's not really my kind of thing but after a while it grows on you. It is accompanied by a retro pokemon style background composition, which as far as I'm concerned is just fantastic and fits beautifully with the game.\n\nStory wise, you don't have much to work with. It is basically your typical medieval RPG, a witch called the "Matron" gets a super powerful sword and tries to destroy all life, super good wizard guy tries to stop her, goes missing after a big battle, you have to try and find and kill the matron. The rest of the story is pretty much a comedical combination of comedy and obscure (sometimes not so obscure) references. You also have a variety of features including blacksmith (weapons), crafting, a tavern which you can own, library (read books for free XP), Colosseum (battle things for XP and rewards), temple (burn things for charms) and market. So really there is a lot you can do if you're bored. You can also grind the holy bajesus out of places you've already beat. The story is overall pretty good, nothing new but works with the game and I like it.\n\n\nThis is the combat system for the game. Basically, you use starter moves, then linkers, then finishers to rack of damage, but you also have to heal a lot to (obviously heal) remove debuffs etc. You then have special abilities as well as an ultimate which stacks off your combo. Everything is colour co-ordinated so you know what's going on. I never got to master the combat system of repositioning to dodge and all that so I just spammed the attacks and healed whenever I needed to. This works to an extent, until you die in a ball of fire like I did every time I played. There is a sweet spot to it where, unless the RnG Gods choose it's really not your day, you can play it so you'll never die, which is really the idea. I am not a patient fellow, so I went in full attack mode and it really isn't the best approach. Very fun though.\n\n\nSo overall, this game is actually one of my favourites. When I first saw it on Steam, I didn't think I'd like it. But two hours of grinding, crafting and questing later, I found myself really into it to the point where it was getting harder for me to save and quit. There are a lot of really in-depth things I haven't went into including perks and upgrades, because they are pretty much something every RPG player will be familiar with, nothing new there, but there is an extent of the detail of these that is far beyond anything I've seen, even in the likes of Skyrim. I'm talking 3 pages of talking about a particular class' base perks. Pretty amazing. Want to know one of the best things about this game? Infinite hours of play time for £3.99. That cheap. If you regularly find yourself bored and wanting something rewarding to do, buy this game. There is also a free trail. And if you are a rogue like lover, this is definitely for you. Highly rated in my books.","December 18, 2014","true","5.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I was really amused and psyched when I saw (Male|Female|Other) at the screen for picking gender. I've got to admit, that's prety rad. To the little gender fluid person out there, you don't have to worry about fitting yourself into the Male or Female box~ Rejoice!\n4) The game~ There is quite a lot of customization at the beginning, choosing class, race, augments, race,etc, there's so many!The story line is quite funny also ( Lol @Cyrus). I was sold at "Getting kicked out of nude painting class has been your biggest regret.". It's a great game if you're looking for some nostalgic fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cloudtwonj/recommended/328760/","cloudtwonj","Cloud","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cloudtwonj/","156 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nQuick note prior to the review:  If you wish to play an older, but completely free version of SanctuaryRPG, head on over to www.playsrpg.com.  It may be an older version, but it gives you plenty of content to test and is very fun.\n\nNow, onto the review itself.\n\nSanctuaryRPG: Black Edition is a text based RPG based off the old classic RPGs, while also taking inspiration from many new-age RPGs and JRPGs.  Seeing as I'm a fan of reviews listing information about how the game is played and the strong points of it's systems, I'll explain a bit of it, and what I like about it.\n\nCombat:  This makes up a lot of the game, and as such, is an important system.  Combat works on a turn based system using abilities and combos.  Select one of your attacks with the corrosponding number or letter key, press enter.  Simple.  There are 6 different classes, each with their own attacks and special abilities, which gives the game great variety on how you like to combat your enemies.  In addition, all classes have their own ultimate abilities which are charged based on the use of combos.  Ultimate abilities work much like you think they would, and each one has it's own advantages.  The game also features lots of status effects and enemy affixes, which can change the pace and strategy of the fight significantly.  There's also many other different types of abilities with their own special uses you will unlock later in the game and experience for yourself.\n\nEvents:  This game features random events you may find throughout your adventure.  Events will usually occur when you find a secret area, indicated with either an [8] or a [x] on the scene depicted in the menu.  Events are usually some random choice based event.  One such event might go as follows:\n\n(A giant cow is blocking your path.)\n\n[1]  Jump on it.\n[2]  Kiss it.\n[3]  Smack it.\n[4]  Walk away.\n\nDepending on which answer you select, there may be consequences or rewards ranging from being damaged down to 1hp, healed to full health or being rewarded with a random item drop.  There's a wide variety of events, some more humorous than others, and plenty of loot to get from them.\n\nCrafting:  Yes, there's crafting, and the system for it is pretty neat as well.  Using different crafting abilities, and there's many more to unlock by leveling up your crafting skill, you need to fill the progress bar while also watching your durability, heat, and quality in order to ensure better stats.\n\nThese are a few of the systems inside of both the classic SanctuaryRPG and the new SanctuaryRPG: Black Edition.  I've played quite a bit of the classic, but only just gotten ahold of a copy of the Black Edition (Thanks again, Devs :D) and look forward to seeing all the differences and rebalances.\n\nOverall, I'd probably rate this game a good 82/100.  If you're one to enjoy text based RPGs at all, you'll more than likely enjoy this.","December 27, 2014","true","18.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joebomb10/recommended/328760/","joebomb10","Maester Silvio","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joebomb10/","423 products in account","IntroductionSanctuaryRPG: Black Edition is a humorous and strategic turn-based dungeon crawling ASCII adventure. Drawing heavy inspiration from both Roguelikes and Japanese RPGs, the game offers a robust action-RPG inspired combat system.\n\nThe StoryYou know those old B movies you saw at the drive-in, or those old sci-fi flicks that are now in the Public Domain? SanctuaryRPG is like that, and it is meant to be that. It doesn’t try and be some AAA game produced by some ridiculously large studio. No, SanctuaryRPG is a wonderful mess of self-deprecating satire, and that’s what makes it so perfect for a text-based RPG.\n\nStory Verdict: The precise formula for a comedic, but intriguing, story that’ll keep you enticed.\nStory Score: 9/10\n\nThe GraphicsNo, I’m not going to tell you that the graphics are terrible because there’s no fancy SSAA or SSAO. SanctuaryRPG relishes in the wonderful world of ASCII art that is detailed and beautiful. Not only that but the game manages to include secrets within the backdrop of symbols that fit naturally. It works, and it works wonderfully!\n\nGraphics Verdict: Simple and old-school graphics are a throwback to a forgotten era of games.\nGraphics Score: 9/10\n\nThe ControlsYou can play the whole game with a keyboard, and at no time are controls hidden behind memory. It might take a little time to get used to because of the mechanics, but you are never timed in your decisions. They nailed down solid controls that work well and are always visible.\n\nControls Verdict: Simple to use and never hidden.\nControls Score: 9/10\n\nThe SoundsA myriad of old and newer sounds come together to form the nostalgic, synth-ridden soundtrack of SanctuaryRPG. It’s fun, engaging, and varies enough to keep things fresh during your various adventures. On top of the soundtrack you have the familiar sound effects one would expect from a text-based RPG.\n\nSounds Verdict: It’s honestly a really nice soundtrack with some great sound effects to go along with it. It fits well!\nSounds Score: 8.5/10\n\nThe DifficultyAs with any rogue-like game, SanctuaryRPG’s difficulty lies in both skill and learning from your mistakes. It does this quite fairly, and with the right planning one is able to go far without worry of some nonsensical one-hit kill or unfair mechanic. There are always humorous things that can happen against your favour, but I think that’s part of the charm. I found my time with SanctuaryRPG to be balanced and fair, but still always difficult.\n\nDifficulty Verdict: Just the right amount of reward for just the right amount of saltiness!\nDifficulty Score: 9/10\n\nReplayabilityOne could say that a single hour of gameplay is not enough to judge the scale of an RPG like this game, but do not be fooled; I have spent many more hours on this game without Steam. I can assure you that SanctuaryRPG is deep and offers such a large variety of gameplay and fun that it’s worth twice the price to me (at least).\n\nThere’s a unique crafting system that is unlike many other RPGs where you have to manage the heat, quality, and durability of an item. You can also run your own tavern; yeah, you can literally become an inn-keeper if you’d like.

I thought I might - not because I have anything against ascii games but because people were saying this game was really difficult. I hate difficult games personally.  I also was timid after hearing that this games normal mode is perma death - you die and gg that's it. I hate that too normally.\n\nThis though I like. The monsters are strong yes, but so are you. Basically everything has the glass cannon effect. You either kill quickly or die quickly. However the things that kill you quickly usually can be avoided or healed off with strategy. The game has decent replay value, though the plot doesn't change which is a downer. So you know roughly what you will fight and where, and have to listen to the same story each time. The first is good, the latter not so much.\n\nStill it has a quick pace and making your own race/class combo is fun.","April 27, 2015","true","10.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It felt like a full game then, and the devs have only been adding more features to fully flesh out the game's world. I'm very much impressed.\n\nSanctuaryRPG has a unique battle system -- I've never seen anything like it. It's tense, tactical, and exciting.\n\nThe music -- especially the battle tunes (there are several, so you're not hearing the same thing every time you fight) -- is just great videogame music, full of well-developed melodies; synthy bleeps and boops; and low, dirty rumblings. I can't say enough about it, other than you NEED to hear it.\n\nThe ASCII art is incredible -- not just the enemies but the landscapes as well. Really does a lot to evoke a sense of place.\n\nThe game's also rather funny in a way that's difficult to describe. It's bonkers, but it doesn't beat you over the head with wacky antics or slapstick. The in-battle hints, the dialogue, the random events -- all are just strange enough to make you smile and wonder what's coming next.\n\nSanctuaryRPG is truly one of a kind -- don't miss out on this lovingly crafted little gem.","December 17, 2014","true","7.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's feel and gameplay gives some of the beginners to the RPG genre a simple start. Although, even both veterans and beginners can feel pressured and challenged at times but not to the point where it's overwhelmingly punishing nor where it is far too easy to the point where you follow a chain of button pressing to win... fifty times in a row.\n\nStory [6.5/10] :\nThere was a blade that would cause global chaos that was set in the earth, never supposedly to be ever taken... But, y'know. It's a damn video game. The matron takes the blade and uses it for it's self purposes but is then stopped by a wizard. However, the matron comes back and surprise, surprise, you're the one left to deal with the matron.\n\nWhile this isn't too terrible of a plot, it feels too cliche where you're the only competant person to take down the main villain. Not to mention, they kind of give a 'forced plot' where they give you a basic intro and that's the reason why you're fighting, salvaging, buying and becoming the adventurer you are in SanctuaryRPG. The plot hardly advances afterwards.\n\nGraphics [9.5/10] :\nI was quite surprised by how well they accomplished the ASCII art and text. While it feels it was straight taken out of a batch file and put on steam, they did quite a well job. The ASCII is well enough for one to not have to think about what the object actually might be.\n\nThe feel gives you really that RPG batch file kind of thought, very well accomplished on all levels of creating a batch or ASCII / text game.\n\nGameplay [8/10] :\nHave you ever played Final Fantasy? Well it's a bit different from that. You basically level up, head to different places to fight monsters, sell stuff, gain weaponry and progress onwards and repeat.\n\nWhile I don't have an issue with it, the gameplay gets a bit reptitive but some may argue that it was done well enough to not be reptitive. Also, the game difficulties actually matter... a lot. If you tend to stress a lot, you're going to want to try out softcore where your only punishment for dying is that your EXP bar resets to nil which can also be said for your carrying gold.\n\nIf you've played FTL and dislike the lose-everyone-on-death kind of thing, stick to softcore. Or else, choose the standard difficulty which gives you a punishment where your save file is deleted.\n\nMusic / SFX [8/10] :\nI can see where they tried to go with the music making it 8-bit and all and it turned out pretty decent. Each song fitted the theme and SFX matched the right time. However, it gets quite repititive, some may want to mute the game and put on their own music.\n\nGeneral [8.5/10] :\nWorth the money to pay and buy the game. It's definitely worth checking out during the early stages of development.","December 23, 2014","true","22.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Fun ASCII art with occasional & limited animation accompanied by great chiptunes help set the tone for this menu driven rogue-like.\n\nThat's right, this game is completely controlled by keyboard driven menus.  No mouses or gamepads need apply.  It's all pretty basic (even if the underlying game mechanics aren't) but enjoyable, if fairly repetitive.   I'm amused by the silly, occasionally mad-libs inspired humor and the infrequent events that breaks up combat and crafting.\n\nThis game has transitioned from donationware to a fully commercial product.  As I scribble this review, I feel there aren't many major improvements from 1.2.3, but since that version is dead (as far as development is concerned) this opinion will change with time.\n\nSince Steam now has a demo, try it first.

The writing is funny, the music is very nice, the ASCII art is great, and the gameplay is in-depth enough to keep you interested while remaining easy enough to play in order to keep you interested.  This is great for when you have ten minutes to kill or even an hour or two.  I've only played an hour so far (in my first sitting) but I can tell this was five dollars that were very well spent--I highly recommend it!","January 2, 2015","true","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Hopefully, with enough time, the developer(s) can move on to a new engine, be it 2D or 3D.\n\nAudio:\nThe soundtrack in this game is great. Very groovy, and easy listening chiptunes, even if they were to upgrade the graphical components to something more appealing, I would want them to keep this soundtrack.\n\nGameplay:\nSo I haven't played a lot, but I can say the game is fun. It plays like a text based, key input controlled pokemon, with a lot of status ailments, combos and overall fun gameplay, though because the text based graphics, it gets confusing if you go too fast.\n\nWhen you start off it throws you into character creation. There are tons of roguelike friendly classes like Barbarian, Paladin, and Hunter. You choose a homeland for racial bonuses, and overall, character creation isn't lacking.\n\nOver time and after battles, you level up, and gain new items, you can throw skill points into your skills, masteries into your weapons and upgrades for things like HP, MP and damage/armour. You also gain items to change your skills and increase damage dealt and decrease damage taken.\n\nCombat is done in a very well fleshed out way, you create combos, battle ailments and balance offense and defence. If you create a big enough combo, you can use your powerful finisher type moves. Overall, combat is very fun, very fast paced and very well planned.\n\nStory:\nAs far as I know, the story is randomly generated after a certain point. Basically you're off to kill the final boss and save the world from their evil, very typical, though not bad in any way.\n\nOther things:\nThis game made me chuckle, and I like when games have a sense of humour.\n\nGraphics: 5/10 - clutter and text walls make it hard to focus\nAudio: 9/10 - soundtrack is lovely, and charming\nGameplay: 8/10 - fast paced, fleshed out combat, and many systems, make this a lovely play\nStory: 6/10 - your typical "kill the boss and save the world" story, though not bad\nOverall: 7.5/10 - for an early access game from an indie developer, this is very charming and very fresh, I would recommend this to people who like roguelikes, though not to dyslexics.\n","January 2, 2015","true","13.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I played the text based adventure games as a kid, and this is worlds better than any of them. It's a large game and while there is some text, its not really a lot of text - which is a good thing since computer programmers and game designers tend to not be very good writers. Instead this is (to me) a new take on text based adventure and there is a ton to do. While using ASCII characters limits the art... in this case it really doesn't, it ads to it. Also the music is fantastic. I'm only through ACT 1 but this game easily justifies its price. Checkout the demo and if it at all holds your interest pickup the game.","February 15, 2015","true","7.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

After you're done with whatever you had to do it will throw you back at the base menu ready to go to town or hit up another dungeon.\n\nThe combat system is rather indepth and relies upon constantly paying attention to buffs/debuffs and what your enemy is doing so you can try to set yourself up to counter them, all the while trying to maintain a combo which improves the damage of your ultimate skill.  The game rolls out new skills that can allow you to switch up how you fight rather generously over the course of playing your character.\n\nAlso, the game will surprise you with it's soundtrack, you just simply aren't expecting it to be as good as it is.","June 21, 2015","true","30.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Just "Woah!".\nThis game is a real golden nugget, you should try it once at least and quickly.\nIt's a try&die rogue-like game, so it's a lil' bit frustrating (you betcher deck, I died like 10 times in a raw before finally make my way throught the first act, and there are like 6 acts if I'm right... ^^')\n\nI'm a role-player since I'm a little man, it's been like 13 years now I'm playing board RPGs, and I told myself "Should I buy this game ? Will I find what I'm searching for ? What am I searching for exactly anyway.. ?".\n\n75% off -> less than 2€, okay Steam, you got me !\n\nI - DO - NOT - REGRET - ANYTHING (Don't get me wrong, I regret things, so many things. Like "no need to heal, let's just hit that f*cking bird with a... Am I.. DEAD ?! A bird freaking two shots me ?!". Those bad decisions I regret, but from them I've learnt how to survive)\nYou don't have proper towns to visit, proper NPCs to interact with, but the game doesn't really need it.. it's a fighting simulation, the menu let you go across shops anytime you want/need between fights, you can talk with NPC but no major things are at stake, the humour whatsoever is really much appreciated in my opinion.\n\nMy advice : buy the game, get comfortably numb and BE PATIENT.. The learning scheme is kinda like that : Play -> Die + learn -> Play again -> learn -> Die anyway -> Ragequit -> Play with more knowledge and more determination (like, 1h later, I'm not that much of a tryhard-guy though and I played it again and again, because that game wants to be appreciated, it has so many things you'd love..)\nBe patient, that's how I made it though.. don't try anything in a zone you're not 10+ levels above the highest recommended level.. and don't try to fight bosses, you'll have your fair share of stressful bosses by following the storyline only, and I came to the conclusion that those bosses you encounter are a real pain in the neck..\n\n\n(Please be kind about grammar/conjugation mistakes so forth, English isn't my native language and I apologize at whomever eye-bled reading me :D)","February 26","true","19.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

I was very skeptical, yet curious what this game would be like, because I had a dream of a game that would combine the best elements from text adventures with the best elements of rpgs.\n\nI was wondering if this is the game I always had in my mind and wanted to play and I'm very excited to say that this game simply made my dream come true and it did not stop there! It actually expanded beyond what I could ever imagine would be possible in text-adventure-rpg type of game! Seriously! For example, I've played countless of text adventures in my life, but never, I repeat never any that would let you customize the personality and even look of your character, all in ASCII graphics. I can see clearly that authors had put seriously huge effort into introducing this genre into current generation of players, great job developers!\n\nAre you a fan of text adventures and rpg games like me or maybe more of a current-generation player, newcomer to this type of games and just little curious? Did you ever want to play a game that would combine the best from both genres and even beyond, apart from having the main game story line, adding multiple extra features, modern elements, side tasks, mining, crafting, building, shopping, talking with npc's, learning new game story related facts, learning and improving your in-game skills, fighting all kinds of monsters, magic, finding items from common things like wood planks for building, crafting to rare items, weapons, armor and other things to help you survive on your journey, exploring, looking for secret places, have fun and laugh at countless of funny moments, situations and things in game even at time and place you would never expect that? I know it is rather hard to imagine that all this and more would be included in a text adventure, but this game has it all and many more!\n\nIf this sounds good to you, look no further, this game IS for you. This game is beautifully crafted as a whole, it combines the best elements from text adventures and rpgs and the ASCII graphics and background music and sounds give it semi-retro feel. It's a game that will put a spell on you and make you addicted, make you want to play more and forget the real time and life around you, it's like a time machine that will send you to the past and let you feel the touch of old times both in game story and the unique game mechanics.\n\nI want to thank each and every person that helped to create this game and made my dream come true, I love this game, it's a real gem!

ASCII style artwork is the best I've seen so far and the music isn't bothersome even if it is repetitive. The game's real success lies in its comedic work and the rouge-like systems. You will fail and you will do so miserably but it is a blast while it lasts.\n\nThere's also a soft-core mode for people who don't like rogue-like games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fluffybish/recommended/328760/","fluffybish","Alessondria","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fluffybish/","87 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is for people that every turn base RPGs from the early nintendo era or even before that. To those people I recomend the game.\n\nNow let me tell you about my 1st game... rather how it ended.\n\n\n\nSo I went to my tavern. There was a few dozen people there and I decided to serve them all. Half way through I drink a bunch of beers to give me some energy to enterain my patrons. I drank a ton of beer and got drunk. Serving all the remaining I closed up for the night. Then I went off in the woods and found a hidden path! What lie was a human BOSS level dude with about 10 times my HP.\n\nThat was okay. I am used to seeing really beefy enemies. I had a charm that was pretty epic: when I took damage the amount I took was reflected back to the traget. Every time. That was actually my 1st item I crafted and must have gotten super lucky! So even if I just healed myself every turn and took some damage I could basically kill anything.\n\nWell... being drunk blocks your command section, I found out. I was doing GREAT till the boss rooted/ entangled me. I didn't notice it and took a few turns healing. But because I was trapped I could not use my heal. I didn't notice it right away because my command section was blocked off. On the last round before I died I was like Ohhhhh I think I am rooted! So I broke free. Then was killed.\n\nI played as a ice-person race paladin and made it to level 24 in my 4 hour game. Oddly enough I am not really upset! I had such a great time that story (ie character). Yes loosing did suck but loosing can indeed be fun too!\n\nThere is a FREE version of the game that is a bit older without some of the newer features and such. So you can try it yourself and get an idea of how the game plays to see if you like it. But its only $4.99 USD right now in early access. And I must say the early access feels like a finished game now. If I had not known it was an early release I would never have guessed it.\n\nTons of replay value. Tons of possible random events. Tons of enemies and items. No two battles or items will be identical! But I can see how playing it for 100 hours would be repetitive for some people. Its easy to play and the combat is actually pretty complex under-the-hood. There are some actual tactics to be had in how this turn base ascii game runs! I am very pleased with this game. And in all truth when I died after the inital "Noooooo awwwww D: " passed I felt like clapping! Seriously was that fun to me!\n\nIf you are an old school gamer and have five dollars to spare then please consider supporting/ owning Santuary RPG. I give this game 8/10","January 4, 2015","true","19.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I really enjoyed the old ascii vibe it was kicking out. The diversification blew me away between classes in the beginning but after a few hours of game play the game becomes a rinse and repeat style game where you are grinding ascii monsters and junking most of the loot in hopes of finding some upgrades and just leveling. The combat becomes very simple once you get the hang of it, so much so that it is boring. The story line is definitely better than the kind of story older ascii games gave but I found myself in a lot of situations where jokes were zooming over my head, it felt as if every NPC had an inside joke and I wasn't in on most of them. Overall, I've played the game for maybe 7 hours. I had fun for about 5-6 hours but the rinse and repeat aspect of the game has worn on me and I just don't feel like grinding the number keys on my keyboard any longer and won't finish the game.","June 13, 2015","false","7.6"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

I was disappointed by a very flat RPG. Rather than a real RPG with story, real quests and depth, this is more like Legend of the Red Dragon redux, you can perform rote activities. You do not explore the world, instead you either select "combat" or "town", there is no exploration. Quests are accomplished by doing 'combat' until they are fulfilled.\nThe combat system is the centerpiece of disappointment, with no strategy whatsoever. You do the next sequence in the combat, unless you are hurt enough to require heals, then you heal and continue your combat cycle. I found every combat entirely the same, no enemy made combat feel varied.

In no way it reminds me of the classics and it fails to establish something on its own.\n\nThat there are no negative reviews at all is very fishy.

After looking at some gameplay I decided on buying SanctuaryRPG and I was not dissapointed. The combat is fun and gives a very satisfying feeling when chaining together attacks. Moving around the "world" is linear but this doesn't make the game less fun. It has a humerous writing style with much of the dialogue being rediculous. The random story generation has made me laugh constantly and never gets old. Make no mistake, just because the game is funny does not make it any less hard.

I love rouge-likes. AND AT FIRST\n\nI WAS HORRIFIED at what i was seeing and doing in this game. The charm immediatly appealed to me,  but the game play itself seemed incredibly lack-luster. To the point of "what am i even doing here?"\n\n\nThat was until I leveled up a few times, and had about thirty or so encounters and suddenly, i was finding myself entertained. Im not sure when it happend. probably as i learned what all the combat indicators where atually telling me to do, and now im afraid this game has achieved candy crush level of addictiveness for me. And it all has to do with the rouge like nature of the item drops and encounters. Watching the little animation play as you know its generating up a item is fun, and feels like gambling in a bizzare way.\n\nThis is a game that opens so incredibly narrow in its presentation i almost rage quited to uninstall- having assumed i made a terrible mistake. But thank god i didnt, or i would be missing out.\n\nFighting,Mining, crafting, tavern running- its all as interactive as a few button presses. But my god! do the button presses feel good! (Once you know how mighty striking that 4 key truely is)\n\nThe music? spot on. Ive left the game minimized just to enjoy it while i did some other things not involving pressing numericals.\n\nThe battles? Once you know what you are doing, are fun and can be extremely challenging\n\nLeveling is intuitive and not too bogged down with fluff (INT, STR, DEX ect. do as you would assume)\n\ntalking to freindly NPC's are only worth the quirky lines and the occasional reward for even bothering. otherwise, interactions could use some work (looping dialogs)\n\nPacing is difficult, as you would expect from a rouge like.\n\n~I KNOW I HAVE NOT SEEN ALL THIS TITLE HAS TO OFFER~ i just feel it.\n\nSO, to summarize, this is a wonderful little peice of classic gaming. Not for everyone, but certainly for me. If  reading (gasp) and dying permanently is not fun for you- dont bother with this.\nbut as we know, LOSING IS FUN! and READING IS ..FUN!\n\nAlso.. the level of "oh, thank god i did that other wise id have missed (insert thing here)" is just right.

The combat harkens back to turn-based JRPGs while remaining complex and engaging, as well as Dungeons and Dragons with it's strong, class-based system. There are also many things to do outside of combat, such as crafting, building up a camp, running a tavern, etc. It may seem strange to have to pay for a roguelike, but the price is low ($5 at the time of this review) and updates (both bugfixes and new content) are frequent enough to justify the expense.\n\nOther most other roguelikes, this game is played entirely through a series of menus, rather than as an avatar on a map. I love the concept of roguelikes but detest having to moving tile by tile through uninspiring and garbled ASCII dungeons, and SanctuaryRPG removes that from the genre.\n\nThere are two things I don't like about the game and they are the sense of humour and the quality of the story. The story is thin and generic, and the sense of humour is incredibly childish, but the game plays so well that these aspects can be ignored by those who don't enjoy them.","January 5, 2015","true","53.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All the familiar elements are there for the fantasy vibe as well. A tale of a heroic do-gooder out to slay an evil that was once thought to be too powerful to kill. Along the way you level up your class, abilities, and weapons much like any other rpg, but with this it feels worth it when you reach the next level. Plus the OST kicks some major ♥♥♥.

I love rouge-likes. AND AT FIRST\n\nI WAS HORRIFIED at what i was seeing and doing in this game. The charm immediatly appealed to me,  but the game play itself seemed incredibly lack-luster. To the point of "what am i even doing here?"\n\n\nThat was until I leveled up a few times, and had about thirty or so encounters and suddenly, i was finding myself entertained. Im not sure when it happend. probably as i learned what all the combat indicators where atually telling me to do, and now im afraid this game has achieved candy crush level of addictiveness for me. And it all has to do with the rouge like nature of the item drops and encounters. Watching the little animation play as you know its generating up a item is fun, and feels like gambling in a bizzare way.\n\nThis is a game that opens so incredibly narrow in its presentation i almost rage quited to uninstall- having assumed i made a terrible mistake. But thank god i didnt, or i would be missing out.\n\nFighting,Mining, crafting, tavern running- its all as interactive as a few button presses. But my god! do the button presses feel good! (Once you know how mighty striking that 4 key truely is)\n\nThe music? spot on. Ive left the game minimized just to enjoy it while i did some other things not involving pressing numericals.\n\nThe battles? Once you know what you are doing, are fun and can be extremely challenging\n\nLeveling is intuitive and not too bogged down with fluff (INT, STR, DEX ect. do as you would assume)\n\ntalking to freindly NPC's are only worth the quirky lines and the occasional reward for even bothering. otherwise, interactions could use some work (looping dialogs)\n\nPacing is difficult, as you would expect from a rouge like.\n\n~I KNOW I HAVE NOT SEEN ALL THIS TITLE HAS TO OFFER~ i just feel it.\n\nSO, to summarize, this is a wonderful little peice of classic gaming. Not for everyone, but certainly for me. If  reading (gasp) and dying permanently is not fun for you- dont bother with this.\nbut as we know, LOSING IS FUN! and READING IS ..FUN!\n\nAlso.. the level of "oh, thank god i did that other wise id have missed (insert thing here)" is just right.

In addition to that you have a crafting system which consist of hitting materials in one of 3 manners, waiting or by crafman skill level based abilities, in order to get the highest numbers, pretty much like any other Rpg. You also have some NPCs to interact with, doing quests, talking, buying or selling stuff, once more the usual things for a Rpg. You spend your time on teh fields for the formerly killing of various entinities, your camp (for crafting), the tavern earning money and questing, the arena killing people and random dungeons, or even the library (mainly you just get bored or get dizzy from the reading) other thatn that a temple. What you can do at the different places should be obvious, one important thing to mention in addition to the, currently, four difiiculty levels to pick from when starting the game, you can adjust the strength of enemies at the temple, in the version at the time of the review, it could change, as it used to be the arena back in the itch.io days.\n\nBased on the "review" up to now you might wonder "Well if it is just a simplistic game, which is kinda artsy by using a graphics style from over 20 years ago, why would I buy it?" and, lucky you, there actually is a reason: the humour (though you might want to take that with a pinch of salt, after all us germans are known for not having a good sense for it).\nStill from my point of view it is quite good, even though it does include a fair share of overused jokes, toilet humour and puns, it still manages to entertain me with it.\n\nI also should add that I spend most of my time with the game prior to its release on steam, when it was only out on itch.io, so I can't tell you a whole lot about the additions of the black edition, I can still tell you about my experience with how fast game crashing or breakings bugs are dealt with, as the game is currently still in early access.\nDuring the 7 hours of playing the steam version 1.00 to 1.04 I encountered one game crash which included save corruption (immoratilty, instakilling every opponent, item drops crashing the game) and while that is the only bug and crash I ever encountered I should also mention that I also have encountered this one in the non-steam version.\nIn that case around 10 times in at least 50hours+, sadly I could never figure out what caused it in order to avoid it.\nOtherwise bugs are pretty rare, though some patches cause new ones, the last one caused by a patch was fixed with a new patch the very next day.\n\nOverall I can easily recommend the game in its current state for the price point of 5€.","January 7, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said, there's really not much to hate about this game, it's a solid roguelike, a great comedy rpg, and the ascii art is of as high a quality as you'll probably ever find, about the only complaint I can really make is that the random selection for individual avatar parts has a knack of choosing the same feature 2-4 times in a row\n\nIf you're into roguelikes, get this game. If you're into rpgs, get this game, try it in classic mode, then if you can't stand the inevitable loss of your character, try again in softcore, but unless you have no sense of humor, a hatred of words, or view casual gaming as the pinnacle of good games, there's no reason not to at least give this game a try\n\nOh yeah, and did I mention you can have your paladin be an atheist? Because you totally can.\n\nIn conclusion, the most important thing for any roguelike is to be fun enough that when you do die, you feel inspired to try again, rather than to give up because sir bob refused to run fast enough to outrun an angry boss and now all your super special, carefully crafted loot is lost, and this game has managed that perfectly, 10/10\n","January 7, 2015","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Which is true on Steam. However I have easily put 5 to 7 hours before this game was available on Early Access.\n\nIt's hard to accurately describe this game because to the best of my knowledge this the only game of it's kind. It has heavy RPG and Rougelike tones, with plenty of caves to clear and side quests to get lost in. The combat system is very well done in the sense that you don't keep attacking again and again until the thing you are fighting falls over or you die. You can take up defensive stances or heal yourself.\n\nThe team working on this game are also doing a great job of working on improvements and polishing the game.

Heres my list why I love it:\n\nPros:\nGreat ASCII graphics\nBursts of great humor planted in the best places.\nThe abillity to murder the tavern owner, then run the tavern for yourself.\nNice loot, difficulty, and variety of places to explore and go.\nA market to buy metals, a blacksmith to buy and forge weapons, your own home to craft and mine, (no joke, you mine for iron to buy armor) a tavern to buy beer, (or as I already stated, run yourself) an arena to fight and clear dungeons, among many others.\nSurprisingly, very easy to approach, and not very confusing to beginners.\nAmazing old school music, making each battle welcome just for one of the epic songs.\nThe ability to change the difficulty of monsters in a temple, as well as join one of two religions.\nNot another 'retro-pixel rpg dungeon crawler for epic lewts,' it is an actual RPG game about fighting monsters using a variety of tactics and weapons.\nA good amount of loot. Not too little, and not throwing hordes of crap at your face, a variety of different types (charms, armor, shields, weapons) and a good constant chance that you'll find a better weapon.\nFresh combat, based on linking combos in turns, but with enemies throwing all kinds of things at you, forcing you to change to survive.\nConstant updates\n\nCons:\nASCII graphics, if its not your thing\nExtreme difficulty, with not much of an option to make it easier than default, other than going into an extremely cheaty feeling mode where you cant die, its only a huge setback.\nSome random elements can be frustrating, such as trying to walk from point A to point B, but monsters attacking you about 10 times before you can reach point B.\nNot very open world, which I think would be a really fun addition to this game.\nSometimes its humor can be annoying, for example, my character saw something shiny on the ground. My choices were something like kick it, look at it, pick it up, or walk away. I chose to pick it up. It says something around the lines of "you start to pick it up, but drop it, and it breaks forever. Oh well." I really wanted to know what that tiny thing was :(\n\nOverall, amazing game, exactly as it is. If I didn't know this was early access, I never would.

I didn't even know ASCII was a thing until I started getting into roguelikes in my teens, and even then, I had to use tilesets for games like Rogue and Nethack just to comprehend what I was seeing. Some games, like Dwarf Fortress, have remained arcane to me even after hours of video tutorials. In short, ASCII graphics were something I either liked games in spite of, or an obstacle that prevented me from enjoying games I'd otherwise like.\n\nDays ago I'd have laughed in your face for suggesting I'd be charmed by this graphical style one day... Particularly because years of struggling with it had made me bitter. It had become a sign of desperation to me in modern indie games; the last bastion for a dev team short on artistic talent. I saw it as an easy out. A flaw. A design choice always made when the pressures of time, money, or ambition precluded other, better graphical styles.\n\nAnd then I played SanctuaryRPG... And my world changed.\n\nSanctuaryRPG: Black Edition is a turn-based tactical RPG with, as you've probably guessed, ASCII graphics. Naturally this means that most screens in the game are represented by text, (usually white) on a black background. It's my opinion that this is innately annoying to look at for hours at a time, but SanctuaryRPG have made several smart design decisions that make it tolerable, (at the very least) even to the harshest detractors of text-based graphics.\n\nFor one thing, ASCII games are notorious for often being visually cluttered. In some genres, like grand strategy, this is practically unavoidable. But SanctuaryRPG, being predominantly a turn-based, menu-heavy RPG, includes a great deal of negative space in every screen. Even better, most of the time the positive space is taken up by nothing more than competent, charming, and not at all visually taxing ASCII illustrations that vary in colour, plus the omnipresent menus beneath them.\n\nObviously if you're not a fan of turn-based RPGs the menus can be a turn off, but as someone with a bit of experience in the genre I can say with confidence that SanctuaryRPG's menus are quite easy to understand and navigate. And when they're not, you can type a question mark in most screens of the game for some clarification. Also, and this is kind of a weird observation, the devs take a great deal of care in not forcing you to remember your character's details. Usually if you can take an action that draws on your character's traits, the game will inform you of the relevant trait in parentheses at the end of the option you can select to perform that action. You'll rarely have to look at your character sheet in-depth, making gameplay much more kinetic and less prep-heavy than it otherwise would be.\n\nNow, I know I've gone on about the graphical style of the game quite a bit... But if I do, it's only because I know how skeptical I was before purchasing - and I want to bully other skeptics into doing the same. Because underneath its divisive ASCII exterior lies a truly fun and fulfilling RPG. It doesn't just set up the main quest and inexolerably push you toward its conclusion; it gives you options. You can engage in random events, fight in an arena, dig for minerals, craft equipment, fight sets of procedurally-generated enemies, do sidequests, join factions, have awkward conversations with NPCs, run a bar, improve your camp, read books, be followed home by a potato, and more! And some of the minigames associated with these activities are surprisingly robust.\n\nUnfortunately, this wouldn't be a review without outlining some things I take issue with in the game; thankfully none of them are too bad. For one, even after the tutorial I found conducting combat a little confusing. Some of the less traditional RPG battle concepts, like moveset swapping, knowing when to heal and when to finish a combo, fully understading your meters, and the *HUGE* list of enemy traits are hard to get down at first, and the subtleties kind of have to be arrived at through trial and error. Also, there are no combat animations or anything, so tossing a fireball as a mage is about as visually interesting as swinging a sword; which is to say, not. Thankfully the classes are differentiated greatly by their traits, so it's still very worthwhile to try on different hats... Not that you'll have much of a choice playing in classic mode, because you're almost certainly going to die, and will NOT want to level that barbarian up to 20 again.\n\nSo, in closing, I would say that SanctuaryRPG is not only a great game, but the only one to ever cure me, (if only temporarily) of my bias against ASCII graphics. If that's your last sticking point when it comes to buying this game, at least try the demo, (available on the developer's site) and see if you enjoy the gameplay. If you typically enjoy challenging turn-based RPGs with a great deal of content outside of the main storyline, this may just be the game for you. If you like all that and don't mind harsh penalties for character death, this is almost certainly the game for you. But don't take my word for it; research! Do enough digging and you'll find the lovely, impassioned devs behind it all, who clearly believe in their product and have infused it with quality to match. And if that isn't the best argument for taking a chance on this game, I don't know what is!\n\nOh, and did I mention that the game is chock-full of oddball humour? Didn't feel right to list it with the pros or the cons since it's such a subjective thing. I like it, though. :)\n","February 15, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll try it out but I'm sure I'll get bored of it soon." After nearly 5 hours of playtime on just the demo, I grudgingly (and happily) have to admit that I couldn't be more wrong. This is an interesting and excellent game that reminds me of what would happen if Zork, Aniwey's CandyBox, and Kingdom of Loathing made a freaky three-way lovechild that has a bizarre obsession with potatoes.\n\n\nPROS\n+ Fun and engaging retro-esque gameplay\n+ Demands your attention during battle, unlike a lot of turn-based RPGs where you can just autoattack your way to victory\n+ Quirky and goofy sense of humor\n+ Really good music\n+ Potatoes\n\nWASHES\n= Challenging and punishing, like most roguelikes seem to be. I find this enjoyable personally but be warned!\n= ASCII graphics. I don't mind much personally since they're fairly well done, but YMMV.\n\nCONS\n- Heavy RNG reliance and it often bites you in the butt (example: I'm playing a Paladin. One of the class "perks" is you deal 25% less damage unless you have a Heavy shield. After about 2 hours into the game, I've found dozens of Light and Medium shields but no Heavy!)\n- Pretty dense information-wise, definitely has a bit of a learning curve. Doesn't help that the official wiki is pretty sparse on some details.\n\n\nOn the whole: Extremely engaging for any dungeon crawler looking to delve back into the "good old days" with a little text-based romp. Very, very good for the price.","February 15, 2015","true","33.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seltox/recommended/328760/","seltox","Seltox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seltox/","471 products in account","tl;dr - This is an exceptional game\nAround about a year ago the 'original' SanctuaryRPG was released.  I downloaded it back then (it is freeware) and fell in love with it.  Black Edition (paid now) adds more content, better art, more races, more class perks, mercenaries, faction system, etc.\n\nThis is a turn-based rogue-like RPG with surprisingly deep content.  Combat requires you to always pay attention.  Is the enemy getting ready to charge you?  Are you snared?  What sort of special modifiers does this enemy have?  What debuffs have I got & can I get rid of them (is it worth it)?\n\nThere's a few different places for combat to take place, too.  You can just be out in the fields encountering enemies, pressing forward with the story, in one of the 'randomly generated' dungeons from the Colloseum or taking part in ranked matches in the colloseum.  I'm not really far into this edition, so there might be more later.. Who knows.\n\nBesides combat there are other things to do!  You can take over a bar and serve the patrons to try and get gifts, spend cash to upgrade it & draw more patrons, get cheaper beer, etc.  There's a sort-of house building mechanic where you can gradually upgrade your camping ground to a hut, shack, cabin, etc.  A great crafting system that reminds me of the system in Final Fantasy XIV.  Plenty of amusing 'events' that take place!  See a syringe on the ground?  Yes, you have the option of picking it up and injecting yourself.  Come across a cow?  You can kiss that thing.\n\nThe caveat of this game is that it is entirely text.  All the art is ASCII art (and it's great) - this means it's definitely not for everyone, but I HIGHLY recommend everyone at least give the freeware version a shot (this might just be a demo now.. Google for it), and if you like it.. Pick up the Black Edition.\n\nI highly recommend this game, but am willing to admit that it is probably not for the majority of gamers.\n\n","February 16, 2015","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I keep finding myself coming back to it simply to chill out and enjoy playing a game that doesn't require fast reactions.\n\nIt takes time to get used to, so I recommend first downloading their "demo" (basically full game, but lacking in the black edition features) from their website. If you enjoyed it, get this game. I bought it, because I really liked the demo and thought "eh, only 4 quid, may as well suport the developers for this awesome game". I was really surprised just by how much bonus content there is in the Black Edition - I highly recommend purchasing it!\n\nThe only thing that pushed me away (initially) was the combat - I had no idea how it worked, so in case anyone reading this is wondering the same: Basically the numbers are your skills and they CHANGE if you use them, and the aim is to go from starter to linker to finish without dying (this is really simplified, but should allow you to at least navigate the combat menu).\n\nGet the demo.

But for what it is, I think it does well. The ASCII art is actually rather endearing and as you put more time into it, you'll begin to look forward to getting a certain item popup, or dreading meeting a really powerful enemy as your character's life is on the line every time.\n\nThe music matches the style, "retro" but in all the best ways. There were very few songs I disliked.\nThe humor can be hit or miss but there's a lot of little references to popular media that I think many will appreciate.\n\nCombat while it has a simple interface, can become rather interesting as you level. You MUST pay attention to on screen cues or you will get punished in the worst way. It isn't a game that you can just idle the same buttons, at least until you are sufficiently strong.\n\nThe first area won't be that exciting, but if you make it to the second area, you'll meet a lot more npcs which will also help you level, unlock more powerful abilities, and so on. It can actually become a bit too much if you try and manage your time between adventuring, going on npc fetch quests, messing around in the colosseum, making armor, serving drinks, etc.\n\nWarning though, if you are a "fair player", stay away from using auto combat. Certain combinations of negative statuses on your character can confuse your CPU self making it make bad decisions (continously trying to heal or reposition when it cannot instead of breaking free from a snare) which leads to your character's demise. This may be adjusted in the future as this is an early access game, but at time of writing, this warning is accurate.\n\nI ended up playing the game outright, so I never played the demo, but I figure it is still a good representation of the game. If you are on the fence, give it a go.","February 3, 2015","true","24.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The comedy is excellent, the Combat system is very speedy and involves a lot of strategy (think Pokemon but more than 4 attacks and a lot more fast-paced).\n\nIt's definitely a roguelike because you will die the most frustrating ways (that, honestly-speaking, could have been avoided if you sucked at this game a little less) and each character can be played exactly the same (although the HUGE variety of items and stat changes will probably prevent that in a lot of ways) or completely different.\n\nIt has a storyline that you'll follow each playthrough, but if you've been dying a lot and don't wanna reread all the dialogue you can go to the Options and select the choice to remove all speech/event text from the game (which is very easy to switch back on once you're where you want to be).\n\nOverall this game is great. It's in Early Access as I'm writing this and launching today, and I really do think you should buy this game because even in this early state it's got a lot of fun content.\n\nThe game has a lot of character.

Compare to hardcore roguelike game, it's far easier to play, and the combo skill system makes this game almost an ARPG. Also, aspects such as random events, makes the game really rich in content. 9.5/10","February 13, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Weapons, shields, trinkets and more, just about every fight you get that odd looking loot emblem and then the suspense. Will it be an upgrade or just another item to salvage into crafting components? Visiting the town and crafting, pouring ale for your tavern customers, reading something from the library for an XP boost. There are a lot of things to do in this text-based adventure. I haven't beaten the game yet but I keep coming back to it. There are several starting characters and races with the ability to unlock even more. The combat commands are simple (just press a number or a letter) but the complexity of it still baffles me after hours of play. Every few levels they add another layer to the combat with another option. Bottom line - For the price you get a lot of game.","February 13, 2015","true","23.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The reason is that both of them have made traditionally maligned grinding experience in the center of attention, and created a good game out of basically making numbers go up while going through thousands of battles.\n\nIt helps that the battles themselves strike a good balance between mindlessly repeating one winning strategy and making the player spend hours on each battle. The battle system is flexible but simple enough to get you in the sort of relaxing concentration state. Sometimes it's not very far removed from slot machines, but here you won't waste your inheritance away.\n\nThere are some things that are bothering me (things require too many keystrokes, there are some one-hit KOs remaining, the beginning gets boring after a while, some components of the game seem underutilized and some overutilized) but they're mostly minor and/or personal preference. I've enjoyed the game even if not every untimely death of my character.","February 14, 2015","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is not so great if you don't have a full keyboard and numpad.\n\nFirst, let me say that I absolutely LOVE SanctuaryRPG, and it's Black release is just wonderful. The project started out free (as in beer) and has since moved to a paid (Black) version.\n\nThe actual navigation of the game is basically non-existent. You have locations that you can choose to enter, but there is no "map" to speak of. The combat is interesting enough, but the real fun is in all of the randomness and volume of options. Everything is a die-roll in the background. Enter a location, die-roll determines the event / baddie. Kill a baddie, die-roll determines the loot. Perform crafting, die-roll determines the actual item. And on, and on, and on.\n\nAnd all along the way, you're presented with options that change your experience. Agree with this pamphlet you just found? Your alignment just changed slightly. Solved this puzzle? Here's a sidequest that might kills you. Killed a boss? Here's a subtle customization option. I've been playing SRPG for about 3 months now (free then Black), and I've only used one class. There's a HUGE amount of gameplay variation available.\n\nThe graphics are actually very well thought out, and there is tongue-in-cheek commentary to be found in the ASCII art. You won't get a chill from seeing moonlight glinting off the water as the breeze blows through shoots of grass, but the graphical approach works well to pull off a consistent aesthetic and feel.\n\nNow here's the caveat: you really should play with a full keyboard plus numpad. The experience is clearly tailored for a left hand on A-S-D-F and a right hand on the numpad. With this setup, the game plays smooth and the design works. If you play with a laptop, though, the fun diminishes somewhat, and if you try a touchscreen keyboard, the fun disappears.","February 14, 2015","true","54.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Despite all of them having incredibly similar skillsets, all of their nuances lead to significantly different playstyles.\n\nThere are so many different options in combat that result in some complex tactical decisions. With the exception of a few mildly brainless builds or if you significantly overwhelm your opponent, rolling over the same combos against each opponent will not work.

I am a big fan of the rogue-like and rogue-lite genres. Death can be fun, death is a learning experience, etc. However, it's all relative to the amount of grind that it took to take you up to that death. The first dozen hours or so of SanctuaryRPG are full of so many learning opportunities, that all those many hours spent fighting and crafting weren't a grind at all. But after that point, death becomes frustratingly expensive, because of how many dozens of hours the game can span. This in turn, actually encourages even more grind to the point of getting your character over-leveled for a particular area, as a safety barrier to protect from dying all over again. And there will come fights that completely blindside you from where you completely overwhelmed the previous fight, so there's very little available to signal danger to you until it is far too late.\n\nAll that said, though, despite my frustrations with the circumstances surrounding death, learning how to play and experiencing SanctuaryRPG for the first time was a great experience, and frankly a steal at $8.","June 24, 2015","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Love the way it plays and how it is different to other roguelike RPG's I've played before. No real inventory management to speak of, instead you choose to equip an item or salvage it. Quick and easy. I also love the combat, feels really slick and different to what I've seen before. But it can also catch you out, be careful to pause and make sure your next move isn't your last. Level 30, one wrong button press, game over. I should want to punch the screen and close the lid on my laptop but I don't. I may close the game in anger for about 5 mintues and then I can't help fire it back up again.\n\nLOVE THIS GAME!!!","February 15, 2015","true","31.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It plays more like an interactive text game (like zork for example) but with less freedom and knowing where you're going more instead of spamming north until something interesting happens or waiting whilst thorin starts singing about gold.\n\nThe combat system looks really complicated and it is, you have starting moves, linking moves and finishing moves. You're meant to use a starter then a linking move and then a finisher unlocks which you can use for extra damage or something. there is also relocating so if an enemy is about to charge you or something then you can relocate and the enemys charge cancels. There are also rage attacks but I have no idea how it works.\n\nThis game is packed with references to fantasy/Sci-FI films and games Like the lord of the rings, the game also seems to have an unhealthy obsession with potatoes (seriously the second weapon I picked up was a potatoe staff). and the game makes me laugh in normal conversation with the NPC's saying stupid things or breaking the fourth wall. Once during some "Mountain Exploration" I came across some "Random Onions" and my options were 1) boil 'em 2) mash 'em 3) sitck 'em in a stew Which was a hilarious nod to lord of the rings (well I found it pretty funny at least).\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty good and it made me feel weird actualy like I was tripping out or something and I couldn't help feeling disconnected from everything but the game immersing me in its rather ridiculous world.\n\nThe ASCII art of the different characters is really good too even on the enemies the same jumbled letters, numbers and symbols put together are different each time and I even saw a skeleton that looks like Megadeths mascot "Vic Rattlehead" although I don't know if that was intentional (Megadeth is a Thrash Metal band that was famous throughout the 80's and 90's).\n\nOverall the game is really good although i'm probably biased because i'm a sucker for roguelikes.\n\nI score the game a solid 9/10 If you like good storytelling and strange monty python/deadpool humor then this is a must buy.","February 18, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is a slight learning curve as you figure out how to optimize your attacks, craft armor and so on. Although the game advances in a rather straightforward and simple manner, you can also spend some time fighting monsters in the arena, running a tavern and scavenging resources.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/recommended/328760/","GameDragonZero","GameDragonZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/","77 products in account","SUMMARY:  Must-buy for RPG fans.  An easy-to-play, surprisingly complex and deep humorous RPG with a retro text-graphic aesthetic.  A bargain at the price, it provides plenty of challenge delivered with humor.\n\nSanctualyRPG is probably best summed up as "far more than it seems."\n\nAt first it seems like an attempt to do a retro RPG, with graphics consisting entirely of text characters and simple controls and character management.  Very quickly you realize this game is the very summary of "more than the sum of its parts."\n\nCharacters?  Well you pick a class and races, and then level up various attributes and skills.  However the traits, the attributes and skills you chose, have a variety of effects in game.  They're even more pronounced when combined with equipment.\n\nThat Equiment?  There's armor, shields, charms, and a variety of weapons with assorted randomized traits and stat boosts.  You're never quite sure what you're going to find or make, and surprises abound.\n\nCrafting?  Oh, you'll get plenty of that.   You'll collect and salvage various resources to make weapons, armor, and more.  You even unlock more crafting options over time, giving you more to do back at camp.\n\nCamp?  You get a camp to start with, and are able to upgrade your home, mine, and of course make items.  When you're done you can leave to visit other areas in Sanctuary.\n\nThese other Areas provide plenty to do, from shopping to visiting a library to fighting in an Arena or in procedural dungeons.  They even have a few surprises.\n\nOh and there's actually a story behind all this.  Often silly and loaded with potatoes, sometimes gruesome and sad, and always driving you forward.  It even comes in acts so you know how far along you are.\n\nThis, you'll note, is even before you get to adventuring.\n\nAdventuring is pretty simple - go to an area, something random happens, and occasionally a secret area or exploration option will appear.  Youi'll usually meet monsters, but also can find yourself accomplishing various silly tasks or finding treasure.  Though you may have to climb a statue or dance with a golem to get it.\n\nCombat is a combo-based and status-effect based system.  Building combos unlocks more attacks, and status effects can provide vital differences.  You can build up powerful attacks, and acquire more and more abilities over time.  Juggling them in proper order - and the proper sequence to handle various enemies - is of utmost importance.   You have to pay attention to a variety of factors, and most combats are pretty involving as your HP, statuses, and MP fluctuate with choices.\n\nOn top of all of this there's different difficulty levels and unlockables, so the more you play, the more there is to do.\n\nThe entire package is a fun, addictive, clever game that I'd have happily paid twice the price for.  If you like good RPGs, want one you can play for a few minutes or for hours, and have a sense of humor, go for it.  Buy it.\n\nTake a potato.

After looking at some gameplay I decided on buying SanctuaryRPG and I was not dissapointed. The combat is fun and gives a very satisfying feeling when chaining together attacks. Moving around the "world" is linear but this doesn't make the game less fun. It has a humerous writing style with much of the dialogue being rediculous. The random story generation has made me laugh constantly and never gets old. Make no mistake, just because the game is funny does not make it any less hard.

But, coming to this now as a 20 year old, it's very fun. It's not walls of text, but it's not simple either. Your top half of the screen is mainly backdrops and pictures made using Dashes, Commas, Letters, and other keyboard icons, with the lower half being options for what you can do, "1 Does this, 2 Does this" so on. There is no acutal mouse control, and if there is, there is no real need for it. Since every action is as simple as 1 button, enter.\n\nIn combat, you get 2 simple health bars, some status effects, and your options. It all works very well together into a challenging, memorable experience. Balancing MP, healthing, exposer, and ultimates does help in making the game tense, but the amount of "Exposer" does get old quickly, since you only have a chance of reducing it, and when it rises to 8 or 10, you just need to accept that your taking extra damage, and hope you kill your foe quickly enough.\n\n\nOh, and if you are struggling, choose the barbarian, he heals from some of his attacks.","September 19, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As others have mentioned, this game brings to mind the ASCII multiplayer games like Legend of the Red Dragon, and my favorite, Usurper, that were popular back when Doom II and 56k dial-up connections were cutting edge technology.  But I digress, I'll list the pros and cons I personally found while playing this game, while rating each (+ to +++, - to ---) on how enjoyable or unenjoyable it is:\n\nPros\nSoundtrack (+++) - The soundtrack for this game is amazing.  The intro theme instantly caught my attention as I started the game for the first, and every subsequent time.  I can't actually name a song that I don't enjoy.  The tavern theme is good, most of the fight and boss songs are also great.  There are piano renditions of the songs available as free DLC which can be found in the game's folder, and they are equally awesome.\n\nGameplay (++) - The gameplay is highly addictive.  There are so many things to do in addition to the main storyline.  You can mine for ore to make items, read randomly generated library books and hope you get exp, upgrade your home, do side-quests for townsfolk, craft items for a chance at better equipment, fight in an arena, go through randomly generated teleports for harder monsters/better loot, the list goes on.  A lot of the crafting/searching requires energy, which refills as you do normal fights, giving a nice balance of grinding mixed with many other fun side jobs to keep the repetition as minimal as possible.\n\nCombat (++) - Considering you will spend a good portion of your time battling, it's a good thing that combat is for the most part enjoyable, despite the lack of graphics or animations.  In fact, there are many games with graphics and animations that have a less in-depth system than SRPG has.  Typically you will use the 1-4 keys to perform various combos with different moves, in such an order that you are creating combos with a starter move, chain moves, then a finisher.  Each class also has a heal move, and learns other moves such as an ultimate attack, stackable shields, ways to block enemy power attacks, etc.  There is one annoyance I have with combat, but that will be discussed in the cons.\n\nStory/Writing (++) - While I haven't beaten the game, the storyline is fairly generic in terms of plot.  However, the writing is solid and there is quite a bit of humor to the story.  It all begins with the backstory you are given about your character after you create him or her, which is pretty much a randomly generated mad-lib story with random events describing your character, and is pretty amusing most of the time.  This game also loves potatoes for some reason.  You will encounter potatoes as a random event, you will find weapons with "potato" in the name, then you will find items that can boost your weapon if it has "potato" in it's name, which few do.  I give this two +s for having humor and being well-written, despite the aforementioned generic plot.Cons\nCombat (-) - As I mentioned above, combat is a mostly enjoyable experience.  There is, however, quite a bit of grinding that must be done to build up your character.  While this isn't too bad, the personal issue I have with this is that I tend to start spamming attacks fairly quickly (1, enter, 2, enter, 3, enter, 3, enter, check hps, heal or repeat).  95% of the time this works.  The problem with getting into this groove is most monsters have a perk or two from a nice-sized list of perks you can view the effects of by typing "?" into the battle.  You must pay attention to what bonuses your opponents have.  Some of these perks can be devastating, including one that instantly reduces your max HP by 50% for the entire battle (this can be especially bad against bosses that have insane hps, ensuring you will be fighting them for quite some time), or one that constantly drains almost all of your MP/Rage/Ultimate.  I've had monsters with Gigantic (deals major damage to you often) also have the Caustic (player starts with 50% max hps) or Punishing (deals 50% more damage if player is lower than 50% hps) perks, and kill what I felt was a fairly powerful character in 2-3 hits because I wasn't paying attention.  In this game, one death means you have to restart (unless you play Softcore).  I guess if you pay more attention than I do, this won't be an issue, but it's very easy to get into the habit of hitting the same keys over and over.\nOverall an amazingly fun game.  You can pick it up for a few minutes, or a few hours, and no matter how much or little you do, will feel as if you've improved.  There's a lot I haven't even covered, some of it may be considered spoilers, but there is so much to unlock that won't be directly available to you at the beginning that it gives you even more reason to keep going.","September 17, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Obviously it has almost nothing to offer in the way of graphical amazment, but you can see that via the screenshots and that's not the charm.\nIt's very old school, perhaps a little too old school for me. I've just had my first death after 4.5 hours of gameplay and starting from scratch after all that time is a bit much. Thankfully you can alter the settings so it doesn't have to be that way. That's a nice addition. Some people will love playing dead is dead, others will pull their hair out... Some will pause write a review and restart, apparently.\n\nPros\nSurprisingly immersive\nCombat is easy to grasp\nAt just over a fiver, you can't argue with the price. You'd not get two pints for that in England.

Worth full price but a real ♥♥♥♥ing gem on sale.\n\n110 minutes from one sitting. Some mixed emotion about this game so far but moreso good than bad...\nThis game is visually simple yet stunning. To make this variety of varying images with ascii and an entire text based battle system, I mean I've done programming and that would kill my soul... to death.brains oozing out onto the little chunks of skull and broken keyboard. That being said the end result is really ♥♥♥♥ing well done. And then there's the soundtrack...\n\nThe music which so far can vary by menu.enemy.action is a complete homage to old school 8 bit dungeon crawling, and; still seems fresh, and well done and not so far repetitive. To sum it up its like Final Fantasy and father's of Death metal DEATH, sat down with dragon's quest and RoadRash 3d on the playstation with the driving and specific purpose of creating the right and fit soundtrack for this game with this game in mind and this game as an altar to 8-bit throwback gods who demand more out of their Audio RPG elements to be appeased.\n\nThe gameplay is what really sets this game apart, it's daftly simple but if you aren't paying attention you'll miss a lot of sublte elements that will make the game play in your favor so it takes a while to master (again 110 minutes in...theres still stuff being introduced into the battle system as I progress.\n\nSo this game really hit me as a standout game, I mean I just got done with Tom Clancy's The Division Beta and this game has more standout unique elements to it that the beta...(I may just be getting hit in the face with the nostalgia stick)and when you talk about AAA titles with less to set it about from its peers than an 8 dollar indie release (that I got for 2$ and yes it was like a sigh of releif to have finally put some money on an actual gem.","February 24","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very streamlined to pressing certain keys on the board.\n\nThe hard part is surviving and winning. Ugh! It's like 0-60 in a matter of minutes. One minute you're feeling pretty good about defeating enemies and the next you're screaming obsenities because that enemy just killed you even though you had more than half your health, all because it blinded you, froze you, and made it so you could use one attack and oh whoops, that one just so happened to be the one that lets you regain health.\n\nOr maybe I just suck. I dunno. Anyway, it's a fantastic game and you should definitely give it a shot if you're looking for something old but new to play.\n\nP.S.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PutridMeat/recommended/328760/","PutridMeat","PutridMeat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PutridMeat/","215 products in account","All Is Potato.\nSanctuaryRPG = Potato + Ye Olden BBS Door RPG + Robot Jerks + More Potato\n\nThis is a game unlike most others.  It eschews accessibility in favor of being at times deliberately obtuse.  It is truly "oldschool" in a very real sense rather than simply appealing to the "8-Bit" aesthetic.  I think those of us that like the game most were probably those that played text-based adventures in glorious monochrome.  Or played countless sessions of Legend of the Red Dragon on ancient and likely now extinct BBSes.  Or engaged in awkward roleplay at 3am on some forsaken MUD out there.\n\nIf you understand any of that at all, then this is the game for you.  You are also probably like me, getting old, and seeing a game like this helps you convince yourself the things you enjoyed in yesteryear are NOT in fact entirely irrelevant!\n\nIf, on the otherhand, you didn't understand any of that but still have an appreciation for ASCII art, catchy beep-boopy music, and grind heavy RPG mechanics, then you too may find this game worthwhile.  Whippersnapper.\n\nAll of the gameplay consists of entering (mostly one character) commands as highlighted on the current screen.  At first, most of this will be simply an encounter crawl, a series of battles using a handful of attacks and abilities.  Combat is turn based and text heavy.  You need to pay close attention to both your own and your enemy's condition, and carefully chain together your attacks and simultaneously avoid the power attacks of your enemy.  There is a very definite rhythm to it all, and you can die very easily if you don't master it.\n\nAs you progress, you will unlock an increasing amount of side-activites and quests.  These involve running a tavern, expanding your player home, mining iron, crafting gear, arena battles and random dungeons, among many other things.  However, despite the number of activities the end result is mostly about gaining gold, XP, or a RNG item reward.  Speaking of RNG, I hope you like it or at least tolerate it, because this game uses it heavily.  As a result, it pays to invest points in a few different weapon proficiencies as it can be difficult to come across a good weapon of the one specific type that you want.\n\nApart from the ASCII graphics, which are fairly attractive but also not the best I've seen, there is also a very complementary soundtrack that is very retro-inspired without being too chip-tuney.  If you have a sweet tooth for nostalgia, prepare your mouth for cavities.\n\nLast, but not least, is the humor of the game.  There are plots and sub-plots to unravel, but most of that is lost in the extremely silly and "le random" type of humor in the narrative.  I actually found it pretty amusing for the most part, but boy oh boy am I tired of seeing the word "potato".\n\nGrab your Potato and roll a character if you...\n\nUsed to play BBS doors.  Seriously, just buy it already.  The only thing lacking here would be the competitive multi-player, but this otherwise could be mistaken for a BBS classic.\n\nLove grindey, RNG-ey, numbery RPG-ey gameplay.\n\nCan't get enough of retro ASCII type stuff.\n\nHave an unhealthy fixation on potatoes that causes you to rub them all over your body in exchange for gifts from strangers.\nPress (N) to (N)ope out of this one if you...\n\nHave no interest in retro ASCII whatsoever.  There's, uh, not gonna be much for you to look at.\n\nLoathe nonsensical humor. POTATO LOL SO RANDOM!!!1!11\n\nHave requirements for gameplay that involve anything other than navigating menu screens.\n\nHate grinding, because that's kinda the focus here.\n\nFeel that the only fit use for potatoes is food, not weaponry, companionship, objects of worship, or pleasure.\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAlthough this game gets "Overwhelmingly Positive" reviews, and despite the fact that I recommend it myself, it is actually not for everyone.  I personally love it as a throwback to mostly forgotten games of the past, for the ASCII art, for the fun assortment of grinding activities, and even for the heavily potato-based humor.  However, I can easily see all of those things being negatives for another person.  One man's potato is another man's radish, or so the old saying probably goes.\n\nFor my part, the only thing I really felt missing is a solid multiplayer aspect.  Most of the great BBS door games of old were heavily competitive beyond simple leaderboard rankings.  It often entailed a lot of direct PvP, raids, and even things like ship combat and kingdom warfare.\n\nI'd love to see a sequel to Sanctuary that kept the single-player grinding and expanded upon it with competitive multiplayer activites.  That would make the game a true Yukon Gold, rather than the more common Idaho Russet.","January 22","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I made it to level 21 as a barbarian, and the game was good fun all the way through. The combat is different (turnbased, but not what you've usually seen) and fun, and there are many other side activities to do along with exploring and killing such as  owning a tavern  . The events are also usually quite funny, and the arena master is an interesting character. This goes to show visuals aren't everything (even though I liked the art style). Finally, if roguelike perma-death isn't your thing, there is a softcore mode where death isn't permanent.","January 28","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then it got better.\nThis is my story.\n\nI am honestly totally obsessed with this game right now. I have a really hard time putting it down, even for necessary things like feeding the cat and going to bed.\nThere is a HUGE learning curve right at first, so expect to die a lot. There's a reason the softcore difficulty level is Not Recommended. Like all Roguelike games, you learn from every failure. It really makes you question what's actually a failure, and what's just a learning experience for next time.\nI love the art style in this game so much. It's amazing what you can do with a little imagination, creative sound effects, and the ASCII system. It's simple, but it drives your imagination into overdrive. With a few keystrokes, some extremely fitting music, sound effects, and imagination, I go from sitting in front of a very detailed text-based battle to a heart-pounding fight for my life.\n\nFair warning, while I thoroughly recommend this game to all rpg lovers and especially people who have a taste for classic-style games, this game is one hell of a drug. I dream it, I see it in real life now, and, most importantly, I will never look at potatoes the same way ever, ever, EVER again.","February 22","true","29.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On top of questing and killing baddies for experience, you're doing quests for the local blacksmith in exchange for rewards.  Plus you can mine for resources if you want to craft your own gear.  There's a local tavern in the area and a coliseum to test your strength (and do some endgame grinding I assume.)  Also libraries, taverns, random drops, and other goodies.
