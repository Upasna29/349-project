Another company acquired Race To Mars (One More Level) and promised that they'd finish production, update it on a weekly basis, and communicate to players about the state of the game.\n\nThose were lies. They haven't updated the game weekly, nor did they do it for even one month. It has now beens months since the last update, and the developer has gone silent. DO NOT BUY THIS VAPORWARE.\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nFirst off, let me be clear: there is virtually nothing to this game. Beyond the basic buildings that have always been available, the vast majority of mechanics listed in the games description don't exist, with even its most vocal supporters only logging less than 10 hours due to no content. The developers hadn't produced a single update for nearly a year, hinting at some elusive "massive update" that they always claimed was just around the corner. That update has FINALLY come out, and it couldn't be any more clear that this is a scam. What's the big change?... a simple UI overhaul. The campaign is non-existant/unplayable since literally only 3 buildings (of the over dozen that have always claimed to be "around the corner") are in the game. Well, scratch that--2 of the 3 buildings say "Under Development" when you click on them. The 3D world you play within always looked unrefined and sloppy with underaverage visuals, but their one annual update seems to have managed to make it look even more unprofessional. Add on top of all of this that the game STILL contains choppy english, and well...\n\nI wanted to really like this game, and I tried to trust the developers at their word, but this "game" is nothing more than an empty slot on Steam, attempting to take money from people by tricking them into thinking they're buying a game in progress. It's not. DO. NOT. BUY.","January 23, 2015","false","1.0"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","33","36","2","12"

Out of all buildings available in the game only two or three are actually usable yet, all others only have a "graphical userinterface not yet implemented"-screen.\n\nThe graphics are okay, just be aware that you'll never get to see something that isn't shown on the screenshots already: When you click the "End Turn" button in the upper right corner a night-day-cycle animation is played, and you'll see this animation quite often.\n\nAbout the game itself: I have no idea. It sounds promising, but the lack of tutorial definitely keeps you from actually playing (unless you like to figure out which technologies in a tech-tree you need to explore to get an actual result).\nAbsolutely nothing in the menus has a comment on what it influences, some menus aren't even translated yet, and the few things that already work don't really do anything - e.g. Prestige-points: You can hold press-conferences, which increase or decrease your prestige in four different fields, depending on your answers to the reporters questions.\nBut that's it - four numbers go up or down, and you have absolutely no idea what the point is. I guess it has something to do with your contracts and how much you earn from them, but for like everything else I'm left guessing.\n\nAt the end of the day it's simply far too early for this game to exist on steam: Most other Early Access-Games are playable with not all content yet implemented, and a lot of bugs - this game doesn't seem to have lots of bugs, simply because nothing exists that could be bugged yet.\n\nConclusion: I'm looking forward to the game, since the idea really looks promising, but I can't recommend buying this game YET. My recommendation: check again in two or three months, because at the moment you'll be heavily disappointed by spending 18,99€ (or the equivalent amount in your countries currency) on this game.\n\nI'll keep an eye on the game and check out if the updates improve it and will update my review.","March 8, 2014","false","2.2"," 45 of 58 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","45","58","0","0"

(more on that below)\n\nBut first the question most want answered upfront.\nIs it playable? No not really but the progress is really showing now.\nLets break it a bit down.\n\nInterface is getting very nice with clear icons and easy to read graphs but I feel this game might have a very steep learning curve later on the project based on the types of resources and graphs. And I for one would love that.\n\nPerformancewise saying this game toke a big hit is a understatement, but I am actually happy to see that to.Because that means more intensive calculations are being done and that means progress. I am sure they will eventually go back to performance optimization but for now its a crawl but for testing purposes do able.\n\nNot a lot on gameplay yet. except I belief its going to be the kind of easy to get into hard to master. There is to little of actualy gameplay and win, lose states yet. What I can say is that parts of busines project management are starting to surface more and more. And the ones implemented are being done better than some serious gaming training programs I have had the displeasure of using.\n\nBut the biggest improvement are the developers tasked now with this broken and challenging project. After a bit of a slow start things went smoother and smoother each month. For starters the update frequency. This has gone to a steady once a month sizable update. The changelog is also clearly written and we are told which parts of the game will be disabled or get broken and the reason behind it. I however would really wish the developers started to use something like Trello as ways of showing roadmap and project tasks. But that is not really feasible sadly\n\nWe also have some feedback from the developers in the forum. Yes I agree withe veryone thinking that this *should be* something normal for every project. But it sure as hell has not been that way untill now for this game project. And even though I think there could be a bit more communication towards the customers it is still a big improvement.\n\nSo communication back is sparse but they do actually listen to the critique suggestions and bug reports. Every month I see little things tackled and some things put a side for later because its not smart to fix it yet. And it should be done that way fixing every little cosmetic or grammar error while you are still building the framework is a disaster for productivity and planning. Like building a house by putting the doors inplace before you got the rooms done.\n\n\nSo what did I learn in this couple of months about the new team based on there progress.\nThey are pasionate, they really really want this game made no matter how negative people think about it.\n\nThey are dedicated to provide good quality management and project management and the proof is in the changelogs.\n\nThey are still learning how this game was first developed but they are starting to get a clearer picture dissecting it bit by bit.\n\nSo would I recommend buying this game in the state it is right now?\nSurprisingly I am going to say yes. Not for it being a good game or because I think it will get done eventually. But simply because the developers deserve it.\n\nKeep in mind this project might still sink hard in the future. But the biggest risk is shortage of resources and not incompetence bad design decisions or lack of communication.\n\nWhile we can't lower the risk of this sinking by giving them more of the most valuable resource we have at our disposal (time) we can give them money in order to stay afloat as long as possible.\n\nAnd even than when it sinks I atleast feel it has been worth it. Because some developers had the change to learn a great deal and might actually produce a good game from the start. But call me optimistic I think this game will be released in a playable state.\n\nBut going from a very negative review state to a neutral or positive one is going to be a big challenge. One I even think the developers should not strive for as fixing someone else there mistakes is child's play compared to fixing someone else there reputation.\n\n\nAs I always say to my team "To succeed is nothing more than becoming bad at making mistakes by just not being afraid of them"\n\nSo lets not be afraid of making the mistake which involves buying this game.\n\n-\n\nBelow you can find my previous review of the game in January. This might give you some comparison with the April review.\n\n-\nNote this game has now a new publisher and developer and while It is certainly lightyears away from being ready there is a glimmer of hope again that the game will actually be released in some working state in the future. See the last part for the previous review.\n\n\nThe current state of the game:\nLess possible than was released before. The reason behind this is acceptable however. They want to fix the framework before moving on to features and the game itself. To me that seems like a good decision I however have no clue what is being done with our bug reports and suggestions as there is little to no communcation between customers and developers in that regard.\n\n\nUpdates:\nAfter a big fiasco resulting in a large delay on the releases on steam compared to other platforms we are finally seeing some progress. This makes it possible again to file bug reports without having to worry about if things were already fixed or investigated.\n\n\nShould you buy this game:\nNo not yet.\n\nThis title has had a lot of problems and still has. The new developers seems to be motivated to take things up but I have no idea of there capabilites and talent in general to do so. Once the framework has been redone and the game starts to be playable only than can we answer the question.\n\nThe big deciding factor to my no is the new publisher (OneMoreLevel) which fails to show any kind of\ninvolvement.They failed to answer a e-mail adressed several months ago to there website and there is little to no trace of any involvement in the last couple of months on the forum. Why is this important? because they are the contractors that hired the external developers and as such if the contractors are not involved than the developers are left with little to no feedback on there directions.\n\nSo what should a potential buyer do?\nFollow the game development but do not invest your money untill the updates state a working demo. After that you can test for a little over a hour if you like the direction the game is taking and decide to take a refund or take the risk by keeping the game. I believe this will take atleast a half year from the release of this review based on the current state and speed of development.\n\n\nWhat shoulds someone do who bought the game already?\nFile all your complaints, suggestions and bug reports as much as you can.\nIf you do not see anything is being done with it in a couple of months than most likely your money is lost on a failed project. However without these reports the game will surerly fail and we the customers are than partially to blame. So if we want the game to succeed we have to contribute information.","April 22","true","4.7"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","27","31","3","3"

I love the idea, the current level of play is very bare, but I can see where they want to go with it and am very much looking forward to seeing it.\n\nAnd that's what this is right now. Potential. They have had issues with personnel, and their update timings are atrocious (once every month or two at best). They haven't had a patch in a long while, but they have teased a major update that they haven't been able to bring to fruition yet.\n\nI haven't lost hope in Intermarum or this game yet, but I can't recommend the game as is. If this game is something you think sounds like a good one, put it on your follow or wish list and keep an eye on it, but don't buy it as of yet. Wait until the next update at least. It's a month or two overdue now. Which leads me into my next point...\n\nThey seriously need to up their PR game. Weekly updates would be awesome. Even short ones, just a few sentences saying they added new graphics to 2 buildings and tested 3 new contracts. Whatever. Anything to let us know that work is still being done. Something that will keep us even mildly interested. And make the game look less like just another Early Access that went down the drain of development hell.\n\nIn the end, like I said, it has potential. It's current state is playable (at least, i've been able to launch satellites, but that's it), but is so very barebones right now. I hope to someday change this to a yes and go get it recommendation, but at this rate, it's going to be a while.\n\nUPDATE: They've finally released their long awaited "Apollo Update". The game looks quite a bit better. There's quite a bit more to do. It's seems to not be abandoned just yet. There's a lot that still needs work. Many of the buildings don't have a GUI or any use really yet outside of required for research. It looks like you can build the buildings, research the technologies and build sapcey things. One significant point to note, the amount of spacey things you can build is ridiculous. This was obviously the meat of the update (along with the graphics and GUI). The number of satellites, rockets, pieces of equipment are extensive. You can go all the way to building a fully sustainable Mars Base on the planet of Mars, it looks like. The one thing I wish they had put into this release was the contracts idea with the NSaAO, but that's not in there yet.\n\nI won't change this to recommended quite yet, but the game is playable, with all the research and pieces you need to build a Mars Base it looks like. If this game is something you want or are looking forward to, I would consider getting your hopes up. I'll probably change this to a yes once they get the contract system up and running so that you can have an effective, money-making space enterprise. I'm feeling much more positive about this game now.","November 11, 2014","false","12.6"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","0"

In BARIS, the focus was very much the Space Race of the Cold War and beating the USA/USSR to various landmarks; RTM however is set in the 21st Century and has you competing against private companies who are also looking to reach to Mars.\n\nI have only played the game a little bit, but it seems to be fairly intuitive as many of the menus do what you would expect them to, with only one or two screens which confused me. Some actions such as launching the first satellite would be improved with tooltips or something else to make the process a little clearer.\n\nIt is an Early Access game, so there are features needed to be added, and some of the screens either haven't been translated into English yet, or the language needs a little tweaking to make the meaning clearer. That being said, with the ability to launch a wider variety of missions to be added at a later date, I can see this being a game I could sink many hours into further into development.","March 7, 2014","true","2.7"," 55 of 89 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","55","89","0","0"

I am not thrilled that the developers allowed such an unfinished product to be released for sale.  Most of the building meshes are incomplete, most of the buildings have no functionality,  the tutorial is broken and it is quite obvious that the developer's first language is not english. Normally, this would be a minor issue, but a good portion of the game revolves around simulated text based interviews with journalists.  Your answers affect the prestige score of your company, which as of this build as far as I can tell does nothing.  However,  the mistakes are enough to detract from the game at this point. Some of the very few functional screens remain completely untranslated, which further exacerbates the issue.  Once complete, I believe this game will be fun and well worth its price of $20 if the developer delivers.","March 8, 2014","false","0.8"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","2"

Feels about 5% complete, continue to stay away from this title for many years.\n\n\n\nI purchased this game a few months ago in it's 'early-alpha' (or pre-alpha) version which at that point in time wasn't even playable. I gave it a few months and activated my steam key to try it again, while they have made some progress in the game theres very little content there for you to actually enjoy.\n\nTo start, out of the 9 buildings that I constructed only 3 of them were available for use. The others haven't been implemented I guess, but it really takes out the fun and curiosity of space when you are so limited with the tools presented. A few of the screens were still in (polish?) anyways they definitely weren't in english so I wasn't able to progress into those screens any further (i recall university to still be in polish).\n\nWhen you build the R&D center you can begin researching various items throughout a somewhat of an expansive tech tree which is cool, until you click research and it tells you that it will be done in 110 months. Once you've started researching there is not progress bar or anyother tool for you to tell when that technology will be completed.\n\nI'd give this game another year before its remotely enjoyable.

Anyway, that itch for a space program type of simulation still needed scratching so i looked and found what has been my new favorite game for a while, Kerbal Space Program.  Forget about this placeholder for an actual game and give KSP a try, its what the devs promised this to be a few years ago x10.

However, at the current state of the game, it seems more to me like something I would call "Pre-Alpha," meaning that it is in such early stages of development that it should not be released to the public yet as an early access or Alpha access game. I say this because most of what the game promises to offer is not even implemented yet. There is not much to do besides hire engineers, buy and build buildings that are pointless and take anywhere from 2-12 months to build, have your engineers research things that take anywhere from 20-500 or more months to research and are also pointless. Also, it takes only 2 months to build an entire facility, yet 4 or more years to research the properties of anything, like alloy or fabric? I could do that in two weeks, on my own! Not with 30 other engineers helping me research!\nAnother note: The grammar. The grammar is horrible. However, for the most part they use commas correctly (most people in the world don't), but there are huge spelling mistakes and other, much larger grammar mistakes, as well as careless typos like missing letters or words or extra letters or words. And one of the only two working buildings is not even in English.\n\nOverall: The game is crap right now and should not have yet been released to the public. But the game does have very great potential for the future, though not really as a space game. It's mosly more of a political and waiting game.\nIt seems that at this point in production, and the rate at which they are updating (not at all yet), this game will be done in a few years, if not decades if not centuries.","March 14, 2014","false","1.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I see many improvements. Managed to assemble an unmanned rover and a small liquid rocket. Did not make it in time to fulfill the contract that I got via funding grant though.\n\nThe UI still needs optimization, especially in regards of opening and closing windows/tabs. However, it is mostly fine, actually. I have reflected my recommendations here:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/257930/discussions/0/618457398957456040/\n\nGiven a current state of the development, bugs were expected, and they are there. Not all the features are implemented yet, and I wasn't even able to launch my moon rover. Nevertheless, I kinda liked the process of researching and constructing it.\n\nYou get LOTS of options as to what to do in this game, and how you do it. The variety at this point have actually impressed me. You can either buy equipment/components, or research and build them yourself. There are contracts, grants, and loans. Unmanned programs, manned ones, satellites, landers, impactors, orbiters, rovers, it's all there, even though not entirely finished.\n\nRocket and payload construction/configuration seems promising. You select the equipment which changes the stats, including payload weight/mass to LEO/GEO/Moon/Mars. Some calculations seem to be bugged at the moment, though. But you get the idea that you can persue certain weight limits with payloads and make rockets for different purposes, finetuning their efficiency/cost via components and number of engines/control mechanisms for each stage (!) etc.\n\nI like such variety.\n\nAs I wrote previously, the game itself feels pretty atmospheric, due to cool ambient music and good visuals. Have yet to see how rocket launching works though, and how missions in progress work.\n\nBe warned though, this game is indeed early in development (thus Early Access), and I personally can't call it fully playable now. I did play for a few hours, but there's not as much to go with as it is intended by developers (though their intentions can be seen). A lot of things are under construction and not working.\n\nI hope developers will finish this game, and it'll be in good shape.

It says release date is Mar 7, and it's the 13th.  Most of the interfaces I came across said "Not ready yet" or something like that, and the tutorial stalled after the first few paragraphs.  I don't have any issues with the models being underdone yet, don't care about the graphics (though they look promising and nice for the most part), but if I can't figure out a nice linear strategy within the first hour, it's too much work for me.  I think my biggest problem is all of the missing UI interfaces though.  The native language is not English, but that didn't bother me so much (it's close enough).\n\nIt says Upcoming Features: New GUI.

I like the idea of being able potray a company in the media as well as researching and developing your own goals to acheieve whatever you want in the game. That being said there is defiantely need for further develpoment of the game.\n1.The graphics which at the moment are obviously not the finished product.\n2. The grammar used in notifications, and interviews, needs to be reviewed, some mistakes are basic and others are merely spelling mistakes.\n3. It may be prudent to feature notifications when researches have been completed other than an email.\n4. The GUIs need to be developed for all buildings.\n5. Each of the available researeched items, such as radar, visible, UV, IR telescopes should have a full description available, as it stands the information shown when the mouse is hovered over the items goes off the screen and cannot be fully read.\n6. It should be clearer how you can make a profit in a business like that, all that seems to happen is your costs go up via research, buildings, or workers. There is no way of showing which research, or contracts will effect the profitability of your company.\n7. There should be a database made for saving games, it seems there is only one game you can currenty have at a time, so for instance if you wish to play the long game and research slowly while trying to make a profit you can do so as well as having a flip side game whereby you can just go for broke build all the buildings get your colony on mars and hope that you make you profit in the mean time.\n8. The text size needs to be bigger in the R&D department menu trying to read which research is very difficult.\n9. The abilikty to build a satellite needs to be developed and maybe when doing so a brand can be a[[lied to your company that would appear on all of your products, maybe it could be implemented at the start of the game when choosing the name of your company.\n10. I also think that you should start with a preassembled work force maybe 10 strong with varying degrees of skill, then from there you could choose to develop them with the university or fire and hire or so on.\n\nI know i am no game developer and i understand the game is still in its alpha stage, however, you guys have come across a game that i feel has the potential to be an amazing game and everything that i have mentioned is obviously in my own opinion i look forward and am exctied about the devlopment of this game in the future good luck guys. i am neither recommending or not recommending at this stage as it would be unfair on the developer but watch this space.","March 23, 2014","true","4.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

So at the moment, all you can do is build and launch a communication satelite (once researchs are completed you can build it for free, it won't work like this in the final game), but then as Mission control is not implemented yet, you can't do anything with the said sattelite.  I think the game will be great once finished, but if you plan to buy it now, be aware that's there is at the moment around 2 hours of gameplay only, missing many features. Most building are not finished yet and are missing textures, features they will unlock are not available, research tree is not finished and there is not yet restriction on what you can research or not. So it's a long term investment (on the game website, they say the game could be release Q2 2014, but i bet it will be more like at Q1 2015 or later) The more people will buy it now, the higher the chances that we get a really cool finished product, so if you can wait a few months for more features and improved gameplay but have the money, buy it now, it will help it's development.","March 10, 2014","true","5.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Since we were presented this game in its raw and unfinished state, I suppose the saying can be applied backwards, as in - "If you're presented with an unfinished product, don't be close-minded!"\nI've been reading some of the negative reviews this game received, and my message to those reviewers is this - be patient and use your imagination. While the game is hardly playable now, I am convinced it has a lot of potential, which is why I bothered to shell out cash for it, even in its current state. Even the best games look ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in early stages of their developement. Give this game a chance, don't judge it prematurely.

Still waiting.\n\nThis is about as bad as Towns in terms of how I feel about this game. Its basically a money grab.\n\nGrats devs - you got me.*****\n\n**EDIT - New dev has bought this game out and seem pretty cool. ONE MORE LEVEL is now running the show, and has helped make things right with a free code to their awesome game Warlocks vs Shadow. Im changing my review to recommended for now - For a few months at least so I can see how the new direction goes! Good Job devs for giving me hope again lol!\n\n\n**EDIT EDIT - New dev is going the same way as the old ones... *sigh*  No updates for months, and little to no contact with the forums.

A ton of work is done on the design, with tech trees, buildings, visual effects, menus and so on. But this game is not playable. To my knowledge it was never playable.\nThis in in contrast with successful early access games - Kerbal Space Program was playable from the start. It had very little parts, or content - but it was fun. This one is not. Looks like the team does not know how to make a game, or develop a project at all.\nA pity.
