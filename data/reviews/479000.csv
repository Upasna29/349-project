The shooting isn't as crisp and I would like and there is very little variation in enemies.\n\nHas potential but where it's at right now I wouldn't recommend buying for the $5.99 asking price.\n\nFor a full video review check out my video below.\n\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=692025117","May 27","false","1.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","2"

No challenge or 'fun' value to be had makes this game a 'play and forget' experience.\n\nStill, VR is in its infancy and hopefully we'll see some better more interactive titles in the coming months.","May 28","false","0.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Caigan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/caigan/","1157 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAn excellent start with promise.\n\nWhile its 'another zombie game' when we have hordez, zombie simulator, brookhaven experiment, etc, it does well to set itself apart already.\n\nThe zombies ragdoll and flop around when you kill them. You unlock better weapons during a round by getting headshots and killing zombies with your katana.\n\nAnd you can throw said katana, which is extremely fun and amusing.\n\nThe dev is also fairly responsive with the community so far, which is a plus.","May 26","true","1.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Pistol launches zombies high in the sky, weapon model doesn't replace controller model. However, first is kind of fun and latter can be easily fixed.\n\nThe game itself is very simple if not basic.

Keep in mind it's very early access, but does not impact gameplay, the only thing i've noticed is some of the fast zombies get close and do not bite, making the guns hard to hit them [i guess this is where katanas come in handy] and break dance all over your floor waving your sword left and right and all around you. It's pretty great, and can't wait for future updates.","May 27","true","2.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you can tolerate a good workout and love your room scale scenario which I do then for $6 this game is worth every penny. They should not have refunds for VR games. I have seen so many people talk about playing the short games and then putting in for a refund. That is lame imo. This is a full sized arcade zombie shooter in the realm of high impact. I just got done playing....and I am very tired. I can't wait to play it tomorrow. Get it. Play it. And then tell the devs to release a version that has multiple levels and scenarios. There is a lot more potential to this game then what is there. Great fun for family play and party play and solo play.","May 26","true","4.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

I kind of like the terror though.\n\nfor 5 dollars or less why not, come try to beat my score fools!","May 28","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I would like to use my roomscale more and the only way to do that is to not have every zombie do a flying lunge at you from the edge of the play Space or have a drunken zombie side step and attack me in my blind spot.\n\nPlease slow it down and let me methodically and intelligently eliminate the enemies in fun and creative ways instead of flailing in a million directions.\n\nIn summary, I had fun but was also frustrated at the same time.

The swordplay feels great and the sound effects of the sword while pulling out of your back and swinging are awesome. Yes you can cheat by swinging the swords infront of you, so just dont do that. I dont touch the guns all too often and spend most of my time throwing the swords like frisbees. My complaint would be that the difficulty ramps up too quickly. If you think of it as an arcade game, it is well worth the money. Hopefully it gets updated and expanded upon.","June 2","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
