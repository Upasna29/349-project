On one of the discs was a game titld "Overboard", which was a funny little platform game about a (pirate?) ship. I really liked the game and I wanted to buy the game but I was very young and simply did not have the money.\n\nYou've probably guessed it "Hands On Deck" is heavily inspired by "Overboard", in fact it almost looks like the exact game but sadly it's simply not as great (yet), which would be OK if the game was still in Early Access, which it's not apparently.\n\nHands On Deck's graphics do look a bit smoother than the classic game but aside from that 'Overboard' had a lot more details.\nOverboard was a pretty fast game but 'Hands On Deck' seems to take a much slower approach making it less fun to play. Also, one of the most fun parts about the original game was the fact you could lose your 'pirates' in the water after you had been hit and you could pick them up again before they would drown. Hands On Deck seems to have removed that feature so all you got left is a barebone version of the classic 'Overboard', which is a shame because it could have been much more.\n\n","December 1, 2015","false","0.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","3"

A young guy decided to make a game about what it would feel like to sail a small galleon ship through waters that a galleon should never be sailed through.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice when you load up the game is the programmer art.  It's obvious that the young man made the models by hand, and for some reason that does provide a bit of charm to the game.  It has the look and feel of a child's representation of pirate life.  While they're certainly nothing fantastic and there are a few graphics glitches here and there, the game's art serves its purpose and I'd even say it has a generally pleasing aesthetic.\n\nThe controls aren't really that bad, either.  There's some difficult to describe sluggishness to the controls - like you're moving a big boat, duh - and maneuvering your ship to fire the stronger side cannons at your opponents is a big part of good combat.\n\nHowever, as you can tell from my playtime, I was immediately bored.  Immediately.  The objectives of the first level were already quite plain, and I had no interest in trying to go further.  I just couldn't imagine trying to play the game for a long period of time, in its current state.  I didn't find anything really "wrong" with the game, as far as its mechanics, other than the entire thing could be tightened up significantly so that there weren't so many long periods of just sailing.\n\nIt's not a really great game, but at the same time, it's a weird change of pace from what we're all used to in gaming, and I think that deserves some attention.  Maybe at like $2.99.","August 23, 2015","true","0.1"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","15","25","0","0"

The graphics are medium but the gameplay is just bad. I can recognize how the dev wanted to build the mechanics and then started thinking of a game to build around it, but kind of cheesed that part of the game and so this is the result. It's unfortunate because it looks like it could have been so much more.\n\nhttp://played.today/hands_on_deck.html\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEWQOe0lJDY","August 26, 2015","false","0.6"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"
