The characters are unique and the story, while told with no words at all, revivals some of the better puzzle games out there.  What would of stopped me from buying this game though would of been the arcade elements that were thrown in.  It's like having peanut butter stuck in jelly, and ultimately only kinda works but as long as you dont play to much of it.\n","November 25, 2013","true","2.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

At times the mouse/keyboard controls feel quite awkward. Its a mediocre game and overall the puzzles are easy and not very interesting. They try to change up the pace by making levels a bit different, but  most of it just feels like the same thing over and over. It has a few minigames for driving different vehicles, but that's sadly worse then the rest of the game and does not make it the break of pace that it needs to be.\n\nOther then the usual progress achievements the game has some collectable items that you need to get along with two achievements tied to completing the game with a high enough score (should not be an issue) and for not using many hints (game can be easily beaten without using any).  Personally I find the achievements for the three separate minigames to be the most annoying in the game. The poor controls make it annoying to do, and a small mistake can cost you the entire attempt.\n\nTime to 100%: 4 hours","February 22, 2014","true","4.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/8970/","Stefneh","Stefneh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/","777 products in account","It’s alright, but nothing particularly amazing.\n\nI know this may be extremely unfair to say, but the feeling I get from this game is that it tries to pull of that unique, weird and whacky yet awesome art style and atmosphere that Amanita Design (Samorost2, Machinarium, Botanicula) pull off so well.\nNow, I don’t know who came first, I’m not saying this is a copy and I’m not saying Amanita Design is better, I just don't think this game pulls off the style to well. It has very detailed and strange scenes to it, almost a “chopped up photos” kind of look to it, then cartoons and things CGed on top. I really doubt I’m explaining this very well but it just doesn’t seem to look right to me. Maybe you are reading this, and kind of understand what I mean?\n\nAnyways, I have always thought that “gibberish” voices in games for characters communicating are annoying, and this game doesn’t help that at all. In certain games like Sims, it’s pretty bearable. But I found that this bugged me a bit. To kids and such it may be pretty cute or funny, and in fairness I think this would make a great kids game, but for teens/adults looking for a decent point and click game, this is not one I would recommend.\n\nI don’t mean to be a complete moan about the game, I’m sure not everyone felt the same as me.\nit’s an “alright” game, it’s got little mini games and puzzles and little bits of humour in it that again I think would make this an enjoyable game for kids, but I found it a little “meh”. I played through it until the end, so it isn’t like it was so painfully unbearable that I couldn’t even finish it. But now that I am done with it, I don’t ever see myself coming back and playing this game for the fun of it. If I were to come back to it at all, it would be to get all the achievements. If like me, you’re in that point and click adventure game mood and you're looking for one to play, I’d suggest you look elsewhere.","January 9, 2013","false","3.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/8970/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Axel & Pixel is a similar to Botanicula; they both use charming main characters, have surreal graphics (A&P also uses a bit of photorealistic graphics) and have point-and-click adventure gameplay.\nBotanicula is the cuter game here, though I suspect A&P is the longer game between the two. And, yes, suspect, that's right. The game has several mini-games where you fly a balloon or drive a car. And that's the part where I got stuck and frustrated. I literally tried that sequence for tens of times. If you ever played Trials you know exactly what to expect. I never was any good at it.\nThat's how a charming game managed to become a less charming game. Sadly. It would've been entirely enjoyable without these mini-games.\nBut, if you're any good at the Trials games and enjoyed Botanicula you can blindly buy this one I guess. I might give it another try someday.\n\n[Rating: 75/100]","August 31, 2012","true","1.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

And that's including a bit extra that I took trying to get the last 3 achievements, each of which is to get a minimum of 10000 in one of the 3 unlockable mini games.  Unfortunately I'm not good enough at the boat one or the car one, and I don't feel compelled to spend long tryin gto get them.\nIf you're a fan of point-and-click adventure games, you'll probably enjoy this, but if you're not I don't think it's good enough to change your mind.  Maybe wait until it's on sale? at only £1 or £2 it's a nice little diversion for a few hours...overall I recommend it but that's because I love point-and-click adventure games","November 24, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Playing the game, I got the impression that the developers put almost no effort into it at all. Overpriced and underwhelming.","July 23, 2015","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
