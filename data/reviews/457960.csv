I found myself gravitating towards the Longbow minigame. I liked the act of firing a bow so much that I thought I'd search for more expansive bow and arrow experience. Thats where I came across Holopoint. The mechanics of the game are quite simple, but so enjoyable. Each time I hit a target, it fires back at me, causing me to have to dodge out of the way. This is what makes the action feel so cool. Each shot I take, I immediately move/lean/crouch out of the way and into position for another shot. When you begin to string together shots and position changes, its an incredible and oddly fluid/graceful feeling.\n\nFor the price, Holopoint is a pretty fun experience. I experienced no motion sickness, no tracking issues, and had no trouble enjoying the experience. Its a very active game, so prepare to sweat. If you're a fan of the bow and arrow mechanic, I definitely recommend.","April 6","true","1.3"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","25","26","0","0"

The whole mechanic is based around firing arrows at boxes while dodging shots fired at you, with every level becoming more challenging. More boxes. More shots fired at you. Closer boxes. Different enemies. Boss levels! It doesn't seem like there's much to the game play...but that's all you need for an intense 15-30 minute game.\n-It is a work out. My thighs are killing me, my arms are tired, my core has been worked. I told a friend I felt like I was doing standing up sit ups. My waste has been bent forward and backward more times than I care to count in a ten minute game span.\n-Videos do not do this game justice. Not...one...bit. If there was a game that needed a demo, it's this one. I almost quit in the first five mintues because I didn't even think the game was polished enough to justify keep playing. I'm glad I didn't quit.\n-The samurai that attack you.                  They look real.

You shoot with arrows on blue boxes that unfortunately shoot back which requires you to step aside or move your head aside in order not to get shot. Later you will fight again holographic moving enemies.\n\nIt is very difficult and to be honest in the beginning discouraging. Just try at bit more often. Do not fell the temptation to immediately refund the game.\n\nMake sure to play in the morning or at least when you feel yourself fit enough. It is not the sunday hang-over game or the after-work tired lazy gaming experience.\n\nBringing PC gaming and sports together. That's what it is.\n\nHighly recommended for the fitter gamers out there or those that want to be fit again after year of lazy seated gaming.

It's everything that the Forbe's reviewer said it was and more. The graphics are simple, but its their simplicity that makes this game pure and fun. Get ready for a workout as you will be ducking, dodging, and darting. The realisim of reaching behind you to pull an endless amount of arrows out of your quiver is enough to make you truly feel like Legolas or Katniss Everdeen.  Like the Forbe's reviewer, the flaming arrows are a great addition as well as the ability to add your own music if you so desire. This game is a winner especially for the price.

I think depending on your room size and how good you are at cable management (you know what I mean) this could be improved with the addition of a few "options".\n\nIf you could choose whether the "bad guys" hit back at all, that would change the pace, and allow you to enjoy the game a little more if you dont want that work out.\n\nA few other ideas could easily make it more enduring, like different shapes, enemies, etc.\n\nThe theme of the room is very Matrix, and that could be exploited, plus perhaps a room change or two, maybe user selected.\n\nI like this game a lot, recommend it, but dont play it if I dont want to make the headband in my vive sweat, which is a shame as I would play it a lot more if I didnt HAVE to workout to play.\n\nSpace pirate trainer seems to suffer the same with pacing I find. Easy for ages then suddenly stupidly difficult.

Requires VR to exist, and takes full advantage of room-size VR.  Highly recommend it to anyone.\n\nThe point of games like this is to trick me, the lazy geek, into exercise.  For that reason, the dodge mechanics become very important.\n\nHolopoint requires a fairly significant amount of dodging.  Part of what makes that possible is the single shots coming from bad guys that don't track your movement.  Something shoots, I see it, and move out of the way.  Eventually too many things shoot and I die, but the single shot mechanics "work" for me and keep me active. (currently ranked #530 or so... so I don't suck at the game... or there are only 540 people playing:) )\n\nThose jerks with the swords are pretty exciting too.  Nothing like turning around and having one of them inside my movement box because I forgot he was sneaking up on me until that point.\n\nMy only con is the lack of instructions.  I've poked around and couldn't find anything specifically stating how to play.  Its not that difficult, but...\n\nWhy does a box sometimes not shoot?  (bullseye hit vs not)\nWhy do my arrows sometime start burning?  (No Clue.  Speed of shots?  # of hits in a second?  what?)\nDo burning arrows DO anything except look cool? (I don't THINK so)\nCan I dodge the sword swings? (I don't think so, but that would be cool if I could)\nCan I shoot ANY incoming missile (stars, crap from that one boss, etc?)\nDoes putting my arrow in the way of an incoming missile actually count as an intercept? (seemed like that happened once)\n\nAs an aside, I wish I could search for "Room-sized" ONLY games.

Many features are still rough and there aren't very many features right now.\n\nHowever, I'm still recommending it, because it's fun, it's great exercise, and the developer seems to be updating it regularly. At first I didn't like it because I didn't like the mechanic that the targets always fire a shot at you when you hit them, forcing you to duck or dodge right after each arrow you fire. However, It does get to the point where you feel like a Matrix ninja as you're ducking and twisting past all of the glowing projectiles soaring your way. The biggest downside is that the Vive can wiggle a bit when you're twisting and ducking as fast as you can, but that's not the developer's fault really.\n\nThere's not much to this game - shoot cubes until you die - but it's got just enough to it to be interesting, and it defintely will get you some exercise each time you play it.","April 10","true","6.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I wouldn't mind it so much if there was actual options to modify the gameplay. Perhaps a more relaxed setting, for the individual who just wants to take down the pace a notch or two. A setting to only have targets appear in one direction, rather than in a 270* arch. Even settings for the size of the target, requiring more precise aim to hit them, stuff like that.\n\nFor now, it's an extremely basic experience for the price, where you literally can only press start and be thrown into a very stressful experience where you are worn out after 3-4 attempts.\n\nSo with some more options and variety, it'll be great but right now, it's just too limited and gets boring too easily.\n\nHowever, I won't give it a thumbs down due to the price.

Let me explain.\n\nNormally these actions would not be a big deal. The problem stems from the pace of the game...which is super fast paced and with dodging.\n\nFirst: when you go to pull an arrow from the quiver (on your back) the vive controller tends to clip my headphones (I use over the ear can style 7.1 surround sound...NOT CHEAP headphones!), and since the pace is so fast...I tend to hit them pretty hard violently knocking them from my head. I am worried I will break my vive controler and/or a $200 set of headphones.\n\nSecond: The enemies shoot back when you hitt hem with an arrow. They do this so quickly that you havbe to move your head VERY fast to dodge the return shot. If you wear large can style headphones like I do, this allmost throws them across the room. Not cool.\n\n$8 game vs $200 headset or $1000 VR rig....you decide.\n\nTL;DR This game needs to chill a bit out with the action or you will break your headset/VR equipment. Ditch the back quiver and split second return shots. Love the game, hate the motions.","May 14","false","0.8"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","0"

The arena you play in is cool, and the core gameplay itself is interesting but the overall experience was hindered by a few major flaws.\n\nFirst, the archery. It doesn't feel right. There is a sweet spot for nocking arrows into the bow, and it can be hard to find. Many people I've shown this game to took several minutes to figure out how to just prep the arrow to fire it. Another problem is that the aiming for the bow is done with the hand that holds the bow, not with a combined mixture of both hands. This made almost all of my shots miss until I figured that out. As a game that completely focuses on archery combat, these problems really hurt it.\n\nSecond is the enemies. The game is advertised as fighting 'responsive targets, samurai, and highly dangerous ninjas', and so far all I've fought is cubes. I'm almost 10/30 (?) waves in. Repeatedly firing arrows at cubes that shoot back when you hit them gets boring and repetitive. Not the best way to start off a game.\n\nThis game is only 7$, so its hard to go wrong, but I'm not that interested in playing it again if I have to fight boxes with wonky bow controls.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cabrill/recommended/457960/","cabrill","Cabrill","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cabrill/","660 products in account","This is currently my favorite Vive title.  At first I thought it was dull, but that was pre-level 10 when I was only shooting stationary cubes.  Now that I'm up to 27 it's a whole different experience.  I literally feel like a 日本の射手 (nihon no ite -> japanese archer) practicing 弓道 (kyudo -> "way of the bow") in my own personal dojo.  My only complaints are that the samurai become invulnerable once they begin their attack animation, and their attack is a high swipe so it looks like it should be dodge-able.  The only bug I've experienced is occasionally my arrow will shoot horizontally and do no damage (maybe I'm pulling too sloppy?), and occasionally the start cube doesn't activate when firing on it.\n\nThis game is very similar to Space Pirate Trainer, except there's more diversity in enemy types at the expense of less diversity in attack options.  I also think it's really cool that your arrows start flaming when you get a consecutive hit streak going, although I'm not sure if it changes anything other than visuals.  If you have a Vive, and you enjoy archery then I strongly recommend picking up this game!","April 11","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

LAG.\n\nYes, 90fps is pretty much necessary for VR games, but this game doesn't want to cooperate. It's not even that graphically intense of a game, so why am I getting tons of lag playing it?\n\nMy computer has a beast of a CPU. 5930k at 4ghz. My GPU is a little below recommended, but it's fine for basically all the other VR games I have played. A GTX 780. That's basically as good as a 970, and yet I can't handle playing Holopoint?\n\nBesides the performance problems, this game is pretty cool. Shooting arrows is a little different than The Lab though- the trajectory of the arrow is determined by your "bow hand", meaning you can angle your bow hand to change the direction of the shot. This is different than The Lab which changes the arrow trajectory based on the combination of your draw hand and your bow hand. The Lab does it more "Realistic" compared to Holopoint, but that doesn't make Holopoint bad necessarily It’s just not preferred. Also, the arrows go MUCH straighter than “The Lab” which has a lot of arch to their shots, and travel slower. These arrows travel much more straight, and faster. This means you can be more precise with them. It’s pretty satisfying actually.\n\nThat being said, the game itself is going to be a workout at first. With each enemy you shoot with an arrow, you get a projectile that launches at you and you must dodge. This is a little jarring at first, but it does make the game very… Dynamic. You are constantly moving, and it adds a layer of intensity that wouldn’t be there otherwise. This game is as much of a shooting game as it is a dodging game, love it or hate it. I don’t know how I feel about it, but I think I like it overall. It’s not “passive” like The Lab, which the player sees virtually no threat to one’s self.\n\nIf the LAG wasn’t so bad, I would like the game MUCH more, but alas, I don’t want to play it as much because of the framerate issues. I wish I could lower graphical settings, but this game doesn’t have any settings to configure that I can see.\n\nIt’s a very arcade experience, but it’s a pretty cool one. I’d give it a shot, and if you feel like the framerate isn’t where it needs to be, than perhaps return it.","April 21","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The controls are very intuitive... boiling down to simply knocking the arrow with the trigger, drawing, and releasing the arrow by releasing the trigger. Move in room-scale to dip, duck, and lean to avoid enemy fire. The intensity of this game is currently unmatched! You will break a sweat. You will love every second of it. Holopoint is played at the start and end of every VR session. Often times my friends will stop playing a game, after having exhausted it, and come back to holopoint again and again.\n\nGameplay Breakdown:\nYou are in a dojo and your room-scale play area is a mat. You can not leave the matt. Enemies will spawn in 360 degrees around you. You must shoot them with your bow while dodging their counter-fire by dipping, ducking, and moving about your play area. Very simple control scheme and solid bowplay.\n\nPros:\n+Most solid archery I have played yet.\n+Hitboxes are perfect.\n+Nonstop balls to the wall action with a very pleasing difficulty curve.\n+It's so intuitive you're garunteed to understand it immediately.\n+Immense replayability.\n\nCons:\n-I can't really think of anything? Is being too intense a con? It's not a relaxing game. If you have a sports injury or are otherwise disabled this title is probably not for you.\n-I get tired and can't play this game all day.","April 27","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Maybe having to hold the grip at the same time so people are less likely to do it on accident.\n\n2. The shaking in between rounds is pushing the border of making me sick.

Sounds boring right? Not as simple as it sounds. The moment you hit one, it retaliates and shoots back as they shatter. And if you leave them around for too long... they also shoot. This goes on with every increasing amounts and eventually you simply cannot hit them all before one shoots without you hitting it first... and thats when things change radically and new types of enemies start relentlessly be thrown, a suprise after another. And no, there are no shields, so no turtleing, and you have to dodge all the projectiles.\n\nThats when things get really interesting and accuracy becomes very important.\n\nAnd its not just Point and shoot, you have to use both your hands to align your shots at your target, and coordinate with the other to reach the quever. You will feel even more bad *** when you manage to hit multiple targets in a row.\n\nI highly recommend this to anyone that the space to go side to side in, and has the physical fitness to play it: but do pull off some practise on turning with the head set on. There is a danger of getting tangled with the headset if one keeps turning a single direction. The game is really intense, and at its price, fully worth it.\n\nMy current feedback:\n- It could use more variation in the music played back,\n- Arrows do not seem to be able to be used as a thrusting meelee weapon.\n- Could use a vibration queue indicating that an arrow has been grabbed from the quever\n- What is the indication of what health is remaining for player?","April 20","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

LAG.\n\nYes, 90fps is pretty much necessary for VR games, but this game doesn't want to cooperate. It's not even that graphically intense of a game, so why am I getting tons of lag playing it?\n\nMy computer has a beast of a CPU. 5930k at 4ghz. My GPU is a little below recommended, but it's fine for basically all the other VR games I have played. A GTX 780. That's basically as good as a 970, and yet I can't handle playing Holopoint?\n\nBesides the performance problems, this game is pretty cool. Shooting arrows is a little different than The Lab though- the trajectory of the arrow is determined by your "bow hand", meaning you can angle your bow hand to change the direction of the shot. This is different than The Lab which changes the arrow trajectory based on the combination of your draw hand and your bow hand. The Lab does it more "Realistic" compared to Holopoint, but that doesn't make Holopoint bad necessarily It’s just not preferred. Also, the arrows go MUCH straighter than “The Lab” which has a lot of arch to their shots, and travel slower. These arrows travel much more straight, and faster. This means you can be more precise with them. It’s pretty satisfying actually.\n\nThat being said, the game itself is going to be a workout at first. With each enemy you shoot with an arrow, you get a projectile that launches at you and you must dodge. This is a little jarring at first, but it does make the game very… Dynamic. You are constantly moving, and it adds a layer of intensity that wouldn’t be there otherwise. This game is as much of a shooting game as it is a dodging game, love it or hate it. I don’t know how I feel about it, but I think I like it overall. It’s not “passive” like The Lab, which the player sees virtually no threat to one’s self.\n\nIf the LAG wasn’t so bad, I would like the game MUCH more, but alas, I don’t want to play it as much because of the framerate issues. I wish I could lower graphical settings, but this game doesn’t have any settings to configure that I can see.\n\nIt’s a very arcade experience, but it’s a pretty cool one. I’d give it a shot, and if you feel like the framerate isn’t where it needs to be, than perhaps return it.","April 21","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Seems simple untill they start shooting back. The idea is that you have eyes in the back of yor head so you can both eliminate cubes for points and avoid cubes shooting at you. When a cube dies it more often than not shoots you, when a cube turns orange it shoots you. How do you avoud these shots? You dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge your way around them. Also there is samurai and ninjas.\n\nIs Holopoint good?\nHolopoint has amassed an impressive 97% positive feedback and with good reason, it is simple but fun. You need no archery skill and it works well even in a relatively small space and for a measly £5 pricetag it is tempting to say no to.\nFor how cheap the game is and for how much fun and exercise you and some friends can get I think that Holopoint is very much worth it\n\nIs anything bad?\nIf i'm nitpicking then i'd say that there is no real tutorial and that it was frustrating realising that physical movement is required to progress in this game (which is a lot to ask from a nerd), only other points are perhaps the lack of bow options or any kind of features that would make the game more complex. But I can't really complain for the pricetag.","May 18","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That is probably my only negative thing about it, and thats about the vive not the game.\n\nThe only thing I can think that would make this game better, is multiplayer. Two archers dodging arrows and shooting at each other, maybe incorporate a couple beams for cover, but not wide enough to cover your body completely.

There are many other reviews that can tell you how awesome this game is, so I'll just tell you my two complaints: I had a little trouble figuring out the aiming at first and it didn't work quite as well when shooting left handed (the mechanics just felt kind of "off"). And we need some kind of auto-pause when the cables get yanked out of the break out box (I'd never had trouble with pulling my cables out until I played this). It's super frustrating when you're on a roll and you dodge only to see your screen go black and then by the time you pull your Vive off and look at your monitor you're already dead :(","June 4","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The constant shooting and ducking and turning makes this an great way to spend some calories and it's a real blast to play too. I did find some minor issues in aiming (two handed) but that might also be due to my inexperience with archery. One complaint I have is that it's pretty easy to get the Vive cables tangled up in your legs and I stepped on my (longish) headphone cord a couple of times causing it to be pulled out. But that's not really the game's fault of course.","June 5","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
