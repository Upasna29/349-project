DBB does.\nDBB is your basic 2-6 player (there is NO single player at all. Please don't forget this) fight to the death brawl game with a ton of game modes, fun retro graphics and a great little soundtrack.\n\nThere's a little tutorial stage that teaches you about movement, attacking and everything else you'll need to know (if your friends will stop killing you long enough for you to read) then you're ready to play. If you're not one for reading all the game modes there's a handy little 'game mode collection' which puts you into different modes every round so you don't have to constantly cycle through the main menu.\nThere are SO MANY weapons, both ranged and melee so you can try and dodge and fire from a distance or rush in and facesmash depending on how you feel like playing. Each weapon has a different attack style (some have knockback, some require charging up and others require you to be stationary) and different special attacks which you build by dealing damage to other players and you can unleash them once your special bar is full dealing devastating damage to those who were foolish enough to remain in your way.\nThere are a lot of stages and these change between rounds so it doesn't ever feel repetitive. Some are as simple as just being multiple levels, whilst others have lava pouring down, or spikes periodically coming out of the grounds and/or walls. This adds a tiny bit more of a challenge to the game as you don't just have to watch out for your opponents, but also your environment.\n\nMy only issue with the game was I had a little trouble getting my controllers to work. Xbox One controllers don't seem to work at all rendering two of my remotes completely useless but the Steam controller and Xbox 360 both worked fine so I was able to play without issue once I plugged those in. The developer was quick to reply when I asked for help though which was a huge plus!\n\nOverall Dwarven Brawl Bros should be bought by anyone who enjoys good party brawl games that they can play locally. $5 is unbelievably cheap and it's worth every single cent, if not more.","April 16","true","6.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The core gameplay is very fun and has a lot of potential. However, it is not without flaws and definately is not ready for prime time yet.\n\nIssues in no particular order:\n* Many of the melee weapons seems to have an excessively long cool down. I'm assuming this is to discourage spamming  but it's unnatural to see the dwarf hold the end of its swinging animation for a few seconds after attacking, and makes it hard to do anything at all during that time.\n* The menu, while cool in theory, simply isn't good. It's hard to navigate through all of the game types and is not intuitive. It should not need a block of text at the bottom that explains how to get around. I suggest putting the game types in a list and having things like the settings menu accessable via a selectable button.\n* Speaking of settings, relying on the Unity launcher is a big no-no. It looks unprofessional and can't be used with a controller. While it's acceptible for a game that's still in development, it needs to go before the final release. All of those options (graphics settings including resolution, fullscreen/windowed/borderless windowed, vsync, etc. and key mappings) should be in the in-game settings menu.\n* Speaking of key bindings, the controller mappings should probably default to the Xbox 360/One controller layout as that is the most common layout on PC. Also, a game that is ideally played with controllers should be FULLY controller compatible. This means (again) no Unity launcher but also a binding for the Esc key's functionality, which currently cannot be rebound and requires me to get off the couch and go to my keyboard in order to, say, exit the game.\n\nI know listing a bunch of issues makes my review sound like the game is bad. Actually, it is the opposite. The core gamyplay is, again, very fun. That being said, it is an early access game and I bought this game with the intent of providing feedback to improve it while it is in early access.\n\nBottom line: The core gameplay is very fun. Invite some friends over and enjoy playing it like other local multiplayer games such as Nidhogg, Towerfall, Speedrunners, Gang Beasts, Spelunky HD (in deathmatch mode), and more. Assuming development continues on its current track, this game is worth it, particularly at the current price (USD$5.99).","June 2, 2015","true","5.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","4"

A vast array of very different weapons are offered, and many maps offer dynamic events. Weapons offer different abilities and can interact with the map.

With local 2 to 6 player 2D fighting Super Smash bros, retro kinda feel to the game.\n\nGamepalyDwarven Brawl is a addictive and very fun local mutliplayer game. There are loads of game modes so there is a nice variety of gamemodes, with some options that can make the game different everytime that you play it. To me this has a slight feel of the way that the Super smash bros. which isn't a bad thing, but is a nice way to set up your game like that. There is also a nice variety of weapons and stages that will be randomly selected as you complete each round of the game. The way that the game starts is that you start with no weapons, using only your bare hands, there are so many weapons that are thrown into the stage for you to pick up and switch through if you want. There is a nice special attack mechanic that will be charged up, every weapon that is on this game has it's own special attack. With such a veruety of stages and weapons that you can aquire, you will play this game for hours having fun playing with your friends on this game. There is a nice ending screen on the end of each round, which shows you how much damage has been dealt and the damage you have taken as well. The only draw back that I have with this game is that it's Local Mutliplayer, Most gamers don't normally have friends round to play games, they use dedicated servers on the games or use their own servers to host multiplayer. Local means that there is no alternative and this might bring down the game slightly and limit the amount of people who\n\nThe graphics of this game is very nice and well polished, from the background, the platforms that you stand on to the characters animations. Each animtation of the characters whether its the characters moving animtations to their attacking animtations. With such variety of stages that you can be put into through each round. There is a nice amount of blood shed that the game does when you hit and kill your enemies. I love this effect and the way that it works.\n\nPros+ Variety of gamemodes and weapons\n+ Up to 6 players\n+ Full Controller support\n+ Nice graphics\n+ Steam Achievements & Trading Cards\n\nCons- Requires LOCAL MULTIPLAYER only\n\nResult / Final thoughtsDwarven Brawl Bros is a very fun, enjoyable and addicting local multiplayer game that can play with your real friends but none of the friends that you have made over the internet. The graphics are well polished, with a nice variety of different stages and weapons.\n\nRating: 7/10\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Good Games Giveaways & Reviews curator group here.","April 9","true","5.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

If they can't figure out the controls, then it's going to really hurt the experience for everyone.\n\nThe control tooltips need to detect what type of input is being used (instead of saying "down + swap" or "hold the back to menu button to quit"). I still don't know how to quit this game without ctrl+alt+delete.\n\nThe menu needs some UX touches. I love that there are lots of options, but the current multi-page display and navigation is confusing. I was looking for options for audio, but there are none. The music in the menus is extremely loud compared to other games/media.\n\nAs far as gameplay and physics and stuff they seem to have it pretty solid. I think with better controls and UX on the menus I would recommend this game. Looking forward to it coming out of Early Access.","June 20, 2015","false","0.1"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","4"
