I got it as a birthday present many years ago, and played  for countless hours, but never quite beat it. Always ran out of time. Pretty good story, but it's mostly the nostalgia factor for me.","September 22, 2015","true","0.3"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","19","25","3","0"

I'm also not a fan of RPG games that have a time limit either.\n\n1st time I ran the game it got stuck at character creation (never a good sign). Second time the mouse didn't work, keyboard only, and finally the third time the mouse actually worked for everthing. I never actually got the manual character creation to work (game tends to hang forever), just quick.\n\nBack in 1992 they didn't have a need for mini-maps, you just wandered around until you found something and often times wandered around in the same area over and over and over trying to figure out where the hell to go next...\n\nWhen you're playing, nothing indicates that you need to rest, and if it does, I didn't see it. I kept getting stuck on walls trying to go up stairs (found this feature extremely annoying). Back then they didn't have hot bars, so everything is menu driven. For instance if you click on the shield icon, you have 8 other options, which in turn might take you to some other options and so forth.\n\nI should also mention that the Steam overlay doesn't work for this game. So it's either full screen or window (dos box). Although if you run it in window mode, you still have to go click the disk icon, click quit, click yes, to get out and then it takes you to a ad for other games, must remember to hit esc to get out of that.\n\nYou've got to be kidding me, 7 bucks for a game that's 20 something years old??!! Games from that time can be downloaded for free. Well greed never stops. At the time of this review it was on sale for a buck, it's not even worth that, I'm sure back in 1992 it was $40, but today in 2015, it should be free.\n\nI'm not sure from where this game came from or how it got into my library (probably a bundled game), but the best thing I did was uninstall it.","January 17","false","0.6"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

The pixel art is disgusting and its all so bright it looks like a 3 year old ate a box of crayons and threw up all over the  software. The music must be so good only people with ♥♥♥♥ing sonar can hear it because I certainly can't hear it (there is no damn music). Every text box takes the Mayan calenders equivalant amount of time to read because there is so much text in one conversation. This game is bland, unrewarding and overall takes up more time then it should.\n\nI  r8 1 commodore64 out of 10","September 26, 2015","false","0.4"," 6 of 33 people (18%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","18","6","33","0","0"
