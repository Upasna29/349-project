They are simply the best developer for HOG and P&C, at least from Steam's games of those type. Nice ambiental music, beautiful graphic, precise cursor moving, without any single bug, achievements perfectly work, quality made HOGs, interesting puzzles and also nice ending story for this trilogy. I really enjoyed in this one...","February 1, 2015","true","7.6"," 50 of 55 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","50","55","4","4"

So far, so good. But with this final act of the trilogy, I'm happy to declare that we are in for a little more than a Pirates of the Caribbean rip-off; an appropriate interpretation that will shed some light to a more fairytale version of the old tall tale.\n\nAfter challenging the verdict of the infamous sea devil more than once, Sarah Black is in for a little visit from the man himself! During a seminar that she organized to tell the world of the secrets of Davy Jones, the party gets crashed and Sarah gets abducted alongside with her daughter. Davy agrees to spare Sarah by making her daughter sign a contract for her to work as a servant in Davy Jones' island forever. As resourceful and persistent as she is, Sarah takes the quest of rescuing her daughter by breaking all deals that the sea devil holds: once and for all.\n\nAs I declared beforehand, the concept of Davy Jones is interpreted as a fairytale, with nuances fitting for a European folktale rather than an eerie Caribbean mystery - which was a welcoming surprise coming from the developer team. Side characters as accursed pirate lords of the old, the eerie sea witch with her own agenda and the ghost of the young, innocent girl trapped in the island vivified the rather dark tone and established the baseline for all Artifex Mundi games: stories of magic and mystery; harbored with imagination rather than grotesque fear, fitting for a HOG adventure.\n\nHere in this tale, we are in for a visual feast: the best and most glamorous artwork the series had to offer so far with shining lights, growing shadows, brilliant colors and otherworldly designs. Both dialogues and the voice acting a pretty well developed, evolving with each new game also. Artifex Mundi seems to topple down its own limits with the application and elaboration put into this one.\n\nAs always, a ton of HOG scenes - with fairly different variations - , a collection of imaginative puzzles and a hunt for a handful of collectible items await us in this adventure. The alternating Mahjong gameplay, the interactive map and a bonus chapter at the end comes gift wrapped. You are in for a rather long game; I'd give at least 5-6 hours for the first playthrough, and maybe 2 hours for the second if you are an achievement hunter. One little minus - for me, at least - was that the chest guarding creepy dwarves that we encountered in former games were nowhere to be seen, aside an old one who'd give us a quest item and exhaust his use quite fast! Hey, I was getting akin to those guys! But no worries, here we have - maybe creepier stone guardians who hold the fragments of memories belonged to Davy Jones to present us insight about the background of all affairs.\n\nWithout the need to belabor further, here is the last part of a pretty great series and a well above average HOG by its own self. Pick it on sale and enjoy with its previous installations.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","January 13","true","8.7"," 36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","36","39","0","1"

account",""Its overrrrrrrrr,Mr's Black" and so begin's the third part of one of the best selling series ARTIFEX MUNDI have published to date,but is it a satisfying end to the trilogy and have they met the fan's expectation's with this release???????\nSo after going to Skull Island and saving the day,then answering the siren's call what can we expect to be doing in this brand new (and completely thrilling) chapter in the trilogy??????????\nWell as the name would suggest (DUH BIT OF A GIVE AWAY THAT TITLE) we will be facing of against none other than a certain Davy Jones (wonder if we will finally find out what he keep's in his locker,more than likely old classic edition's of Playboy if you ask me...............but who know's??)\n\nNightmares from the Deep 3: Davy Jones Official Trailer ...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZSeFPePkGw\n\nSo let's get onto the meat and bone's of the game and first up gameplay,now to anyone familiar with HOG's (hidden object game's to anyone not in the know) the gameplay will come as no huge surprise as it follow's the staple diet of other's of its ilk and doesnt mess with the formula too much.There were parts that felt fresh but on thinking on it as i write this review i have seen them done before but never better.Now the gameplay will consist of you doing the usual for this type of game,but for those who dont know this mean's you will play through the story and at certain point's you will have to search static screen's for hidden object's ranging from broom's to feather's for an arrow ECT,but you will also have to solve puzzle's with some of the object's you find say a pair of garden clipper's that will prune those peskey thorny vine's.\nYou do get a map and this help's as it show's you all the location's you have visited upto that point and exactally where you are,but it also show's you which location's have things to do in them,therefore you will rarely get lost and that's one of the game's best draw's.With all that being said the gameplay is solid and measure's up to anything the genre has to offer.\nOk next up graphic's,these range from the static kind whilst solving puzzle's or searching through the hidden object scene's to animated scene's that help the story to flow along (which it does with ease).The game look's crisp and is the best looking one out of the trilogy and its a joy (at least for me) to actually get to see the one and only Davy Jones at last,as he has been mentioned on a few occasion's in the previous two game's and he look's great now we finally get to meet him in the flesh (well actually with his mask on he look's like he belong's in TRON riding a light-cycle).I will say this there were a few time's i did struggle to see some item's and that was either because i had been staring at the screen to much "AARRGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH,my eye's" or sadly that some items are a little to difficult to spot,but to be honest this didnt happen to much and didnt in any way take away from my enjoyment and my time with the game.\nOk next up music and dialogue,the music in game does its job and for this sort of a game never does get on your nerve's which is actually a problem in a lot of hidden object game's.The cast all do a great job with the character's they portray and mention must be given to the voice actor playing Davy Jones as with all his pirate twang he really does sound like he just stepped out from a Pirates Of The Caribbean movie,anyway speaking of Davy Jones this was the first time i came across him in game in all his glory (doesnt he look like some sort of pirate who wanted a part in TRON but failed his audition ) -\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=386099503\n\nAfter playing the first two parts i am glad to see the story coming full circle and it is both a satisfying game to play through and one that will (as ever with this series) leave you wanting more.Now without spoiling it for anyone this is the collector's edition and there is more to it once the curtain role's on the main game but as Nerissa would say from The Wolf Among Us "My lips are sealed".\nBut trust me once you have finished the main game and the extra part which is called "The Stolen Treasure" you will want more so lets hope that ARTIFEX MUNDI make one as if they dont i'm moving in with the developer's until they do,and A- i like to eat lot's of thing's with garlic in and B- i snore a HELL of a lot.\nSo with that in mind guy's if i was you i would allready be penning the next chapter in this hit series as dont and...........................WELL hope you like snoring and that unwanted garlic smell first thing in the morning!!!!!!!\n"EEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH,quick guys make the next part Skulls coming"\n\nHere's the first twelve minutes of gameplay which does contain both story and gameplay SPOILER'S,but show's you just how the game play's out and the sort of activities you will get upto -\n\nNightmares from the Deep 3: Davy Jones Collector's Edition ...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RytRwSgNjDw\n\nSo will you enjoy this game and would you want to play though another hidden object game,answer the following three question's then you decide -\n\n1 - Do you like your hidden object game's and really want to see how this story end's???\n\n2 - Do you want one of the best game's this genre has to offer so far???\n\n3 - "AAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRR" you after a great hidden object game with pirate's and the notorious DAVY JONES in???\n\nIf you answered yes to the above "What AAARRRRRRRRRR ya waitin for land lubbers" but if hidden object game's just arent your bag and no matter how good this game is it still wont convince you then thats ok!!!!!!\nBut you will be missing out on one of the best game's this genre has to offer FULL STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n(I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE CLIPS OF VIDEOS PUT UP IN THIS REVIEW AND THEY BELONG TO THEIR RESPECTIVE OWNERS AND ARE THEIRS BY COPYRIGHT)","February 2,

Either way, you won't be disappointed. Artifex Mundi gives us some of the best Hidden Object games and now we can add Nightmares from the Deep: Davy Jones to that list. Fun story, nice graphics, bonus things to look for (Glowing Seahorses, Pirate Cards, etc.), puzzles are perfect (not too easy and not too hard), very enjoyable HO scenes, and a few things that'll make you laugh. Music is the same as the first two games, piratey and hauntingly beautiful. Add in cards and achievements and you've got everything you could want! The story continues the plot of the first two Nightmares from the Deep so, if you enjoyed those games, this is a must buy.

I was blown away by Grim Legends 2: Song of the Dark Swan. That spectacular game has lush visuals, great music, and a strong balance between puzzle-solving and hidden object searching. So now that I've played through Nightmares of the Deep 3: Davy Jones, all I can say is that it's more of the same.\n\nFor once that's a very good thing.\n\nWhile I haven't played the previous entries in the Nightmare from the Deep series, I believe the story works just fine on its own. You take on the role of Sara Black, who has enough evidence to prove that Davy Jones is more than just some locker sitting at the bottom of the ocean. Unfortunately, Davy isn't too fond of his secrets being exposed, so he storms your little convention, captures you and your daughter, and things go from bad to worse very quickly. Still, as tradition dictates, your puzzle-solving skills will help save the day. After completing the main-story, an epilogue chapter is unlocked. If I were to apply hard numbers to everything, I'd say you have about six hours of Pirate adventures to look forward to.\n\nWhen it comes to hidden-object games, I consider presentation to be among the most important qualities. Nightmares from the Deep 3 is vivid, and relies on some great cinematics to further the story. To me, cinematics can be more than just bleeding-edge tech. The cut-scenes in this game evoke a certain charm. Since most are handled from a first-person view, they give off the impression that I'm on a theme park ride like Pirates of the Caribbean (obviously). They do a fine job of bringing the player in the story. Sometimes it can be a little kitchsy, but to me that's just part of its appeal. The artwork is very good, and offers a surprising amount of personality. My only complaint is that at times the voice-acting could use a bit of work. One incident in particular involves someone talking to you like you're a silent protagonist. It's one of those conversations that can go something like this:\n\n"Hi, how are you? Really? You found the thing? That's good. Oh no, Johnny did what? He's such a kidder!"\n\nSara Black is perfectly capable of speaking, which makes the scene a little weird. Other than that and a few moments where the subtitles don't match up with what someone is saying, it's fine work.\n\nThe adventure portions of this game are polished. For the most part you're going to be collecting items, and finding the proper use for them. Surprisingly, not once did this ever feel monotonous. Everything moves at an efficient pace, and the puzzles themselves require just enough effort. You'll never find yourself blindly clicking through them nor stumped for an hour or so. Finding the hidden objects is also a well-designed experience. Aside from the lovely images, each scene can be completed quickly, but when I got stuck, it was because the object was actually well-hidden. It's important to note that you'll be spending more of the adventure experiencing the story and artwork, not hunting for pixels or bumbling through an obtuse brain-teaser.\n\nThis may be only the second Artifex Mundi game I've played through, but I'm getting an idea of the formula they work with. I noticed that a number of puzzles in this game are similar to those found in Grim Legends 2. With that being the case, I could make the fair assumption that the other games will have some repeat puzzles. However, this is something that I only took notice of after completing my play-through. Nightmares from the Deep 3: Davy Jones is stunning, and has so many lovingly-crafted scenes that I never paid any attention to whether or not I'm solving the same problems.\n\nAll in all, this is another superb title for fans of the hidden-object genre.\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","September 16, 2015","true","7.1"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","21","22","2","3"

The story is told through fully animated and high quality cutscenes and the environments you go through are beautifully detailed, with moving branches etc. to make them feel alive.\nThe Hidden Object puzzles are randomized so even a second playthrough will keep you challenged, but you can skip them and play a simpler mahjong puzzle instead.\n\nThe good animation is supported by quality voice acting, and it all comes together in a satisfying conclusion.

Like maybe you like eating at McDonalds, or jacking it to videos of Swedish weightlifters.  That's the way I feel about Artifex Mundi games.  I have them all, I've finished them all, but as much as I like them, I feel like I should be playing somehting more substantial.  Somehow I just like the calmness of it all.  The bland, monotone female protagonist, the puzzles that pretty much repeat from game to game, it's a simple, familiar formula, and it's comfortable.\n\nI can't really complain, I've gotten many hours of gameplay out of these point and click games featureing the same woman who for whatever reason cannot stop losing her daughter to various demons and ghosts that seem intent on kidnapping her.  Personally, if I was this ladies daughter, every time she wanted to go on a trip, I'd be like "Um, no thanks, but I've been kidnapped by demon ghosts the last five trips, I think I'll sit this one out."\n\nOverall, I really have a good time, or at least a relaxing time, playing these games, as the puzzles are not really challenging, and the scenes are well done.  If you are looking for a game that won't stress you out, or are someone who values bland voice acting, I would suggest that you try pretty much any Artifex Mundi game.","February 6, 2015","true","5.7"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","89","17","19","8","2"

I didnt think the puzzles were too challenging. The only real challenge came from some of the hidden objects being somewhat indistinct and/or blending into the background, but I think that is te whole point of them being hidden, lol.\n\nThe graphics were really nice. As far as PnC games go, I'd say it had some of the better graphics I've seen, including some very good animations (such as the dog, the ghost, and so on). It was a very beautiful game.\n\nThe story was pretty decent. I dont think it will win any awards for writing, but I do think that it was, as I said before, pretty decent. With so many variations on the DavyJones lore that exists in the real world, film, writing, and so on, it gave the writers some leeway to be creative, and they did well with it IMO.\n\nThe voice acting...well...that wasnt so great IMO. Especially the daughter, who was just terrible. Some of the character voices were fun, but overall, I think this was the weakest aspect of the game.\nWhich leads me to another aspect of the game: character interaction. For the most part, I think the writing and voice acting worked fine with the character interactions, but I also think there could be no more pathatic a character than the daughter Black, and the mom Black wasnt all that great in her interactions either. The pirates and the Witch on the other hand worked quite well, as did O'Malley. However, I think the dog stole the show, lol.\n\nAll in all, I had a good time with this game. The puzzles lent themselves to a casual experience, which I apreciated, the story was pretty decent, and the graphics were quite nice.\n\n7.5/10","February 22, 2015","true","7.5"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","14","15","2","0"

(All I can say about that is getting donations and funding for the museum repairs and more exhibits should be easy after such a supernatural, flashy, and public kidnapping.)  I digress.  The ever resourceful mother-daughter team manage to break out of their jail cell and attempt to leave Davy Jones ship but are recaptured.  Davy Jones is going to kill Sarah but Cory makes a contract with Davy Jones to save her mother's life.  Davy Jones instead of outright killing Sarah forces her to walk the plank.  (Typical pirate)  The adventure begins here.  Find Cory and break her contract (and every other contract Davy Jones has ever made along the way, including Davy Jones' own contract.) Sub-storyline: Find out even more about Davy Jones and just how he became the infamous "devil" of the sea, and why.  And who that mysterious girl ghost is and her relationship with Davy Jones.\n\nFirst I would like to say this game is nearly perfect in my opinion.  Good storyline: pathos, adventure, mystery, tradegy, redemption.  A slew of side characters that are both helpful, and depending on their nature intimidating, scary, amusing, or sincere.  Nothing seems forced or padded, the story moves along by "area" with little back tracking, and the various and variety of puzzles are intrigated well within the story.  It is NEARLY PERFECT because IN A SINGLE PLAYTHROUGH on expert level/mode the player CAN GET ALL BUT ONE ACHIEVEMENT (play three games of Mahjong).  Had the Bonus chapter picked up the Mahjong achievement (and counted toward any other unfilled achievements) this game would have been perfect.  Not that I mind a second playthrough, but a second playthrough just to get achievements is tedious.\n\nPuzzles:  The usual fare for this series, nothing too hard, challenging or head scratching, just enjoyable little romps of finding objects or the pieces of something.  Mahjong, the signature of this series, can be played as well.\n\nThe Hidden/Secret Finds are seahorses, puzzle pieces, and amusing pirate cards all but one relating to the other pirates the player meets on the island.\n\nIn this game I really like how the achievements are done.  They are divided up into three areas on Davy Jones' ship, and as each achievement is fulfilled the blank picture is filled in giving that area of the ship a complete look by the end.  The achievement I liked the best which amused me and made me very happy was the animal interaction achievement.  I do not know how many times I have clicked on birds, fish, bats, insects, and rats/mice in other HO games just to see what happens, and now I get an achievement for it.  Tres chic.\n\nThe artwork, music, and cutscenes are all well done and appropriate for the time and place heard or seen.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game.","August 31, 2015","true","12.5"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","10","10","2","0"

More so than their previous efforts, Davy Jones has an intriguing sense of personality and strong cinematic style that make it feel more like a big-budget title than an indie game. Artifex Mundi's detailed artwork has also gone from modestly attractive to drop-dead gorgeous; I think Davy Jones is one of the best looking games I've seen from the past couple of years.\n\nOn the negative side, I still find the relatively linear, inflexible puzzle design to be irksome. There could be a lot more replay value if the game were designed with multiple puzzle solutions and different paths to take. More length would have also been nice, to make the game feel more epic and give the writers the opportunity to tell a more complex story. Still, the 5-6 hour, $10 game standard has its own appeal, and could be part of the reason why Artifex Mundi has been so successful.\n\nIt may be the third game in its series, but Davy Jones stands alone, and is one of the best places to start if you're curious to experience a hidden-object adventure game for the first time. I'm already looking forward to the next time I dive in and rediscover all of Davy Jones' secrets.\n\n(Rating: 7.5/10 “Good”)","March 27, 2015","true","7.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

So much so that the story is almost the same as in the ‘Cursed Heart’: the protagonist’s daughter gets kidnapped by a pirate’s ghost, and she has to follow them to a mystical island to learn the secret behind the pirate’s tragic past.\nDespite this… reuse, the story does a much better job with great characters and good dialogues, making it one of the best titles in the Artifex Mundi stable.\n\nThe game offers good variety by using all three common hidden object scene types: item list, fragmented object, and sequential.

It tells you in the beginning to turn the sound up for a better gameplay experience and maybe it's just me, but I felt better just reading the captions.\n\nI played it through the entire time on the middle (advanced/intermediate?) setting, but there is the option for expert which offers it's own acheivement and does make the game harder with click penalities and turning off visual clues, etc. There is also a easy mode if you have kids or you are really really lazy.\n\nThere's  the obligatory stereotypical find the hidden objects, but multiple types: the empty silhouette (figure out what object you must find from the shape), the list of words and then there is the interactive which is quite neat ( Here's a non-spoiler fake example:  say you need a hot cup of water, you would need to find a cup, a heat source, and water and combine them to acheive the result.) These puzzles also help you by giving you a useful item you may need on your quest. Also, strange but nice, is the option to play a round of mahjong instead of the hidden object search. (I think there's also an achievement for playing 3 rounds of mahjong.) It may sound weird, but it comes in handy when your raging for the last thing on your list and don't want to use a hint or skip the puzzle (which are also achievements).\n\nThere are also tons of puzzles that involve logic skills and can take some time. Also, I found it quite interesting that you can travel between parts of the map freely once youve discovered them, and often need to go back and forth to complete objectives. That aspect really sets it apart and truly makes more of a point and click adventure first, hidden puzzle game second.\n\nBottom line: worth 10 bucks? Probably not. Grab it with a coupon or when it's on sale, it's a great time killer and was unexpectedly fun. I'll buy more from the series when they're cheaper. It's 7 hours of my life I won't get back, but sometimes that's better than just watching TV, and it's totally worth a thumbs up.","February 22, 2015","true","7.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

However, after having managed to undo pacts with Davy Jones, the mighty pirate wants his revenge. And when her daugher, to save her, signs a pact with the devil, Sarah is again embarked in an adventure to save her child but this time, in Davy Jones's own lair. What she will discover will make her understand that maybe, Davy isn't so evil that she thinks...\n\nThe plot is again well constructed and is better than the prequels, though again, Sarah's daughter is in distress for the second time. And as in the first game, your enemy is only someone suffering from a broken heart, making him likeable.\n\nAnyway, I found this game a little longer than the others but without any real changes from the previous ones. The gameplay is still find items, solve puzzles and hidden objects games. And the difficulty is also well balanced\n\nAs usual, the graphics are still beautiful, though now, it's a mix of the first game (ship) and the second game (village). The surreal ambiance is still present: talking skeletons for example. Now, the items you have to find for achievements are easier to spot than in the second game. The soundtrack is still agreable to hear.\n\nThe game concludes well the trilogy as you're finally uncursing Davy Jones. As usual, Artifex Mundi delivered a great game, that must be in the library of every HO lover but also any player interested by trying this genre!

The story is decent, but fairly forgettable; the skeletons are actually the most interesting characters in it.\n\nThis game has 8 different voice actors to bring across its storyline; I especially enjoyed the skeletons. There's an enormous amount of animation, mostly for cutscenes. The game is made for 4:3 screens and does run on older computers, but all of the pictures have painted margins so that the scenes fill a 16:9 screen as well.\n\nGive the scope of the game (casual puzzle adventure), you will get about 6 hours of gameplay that are well crafted; I got a free copy via the "Davy Jones Welcome Giveaway", but it is certainly adequately priced, even if you missed the -40% release promotion (still ongoing as I write this).","February 3, 2015","true","12.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's definitely the best of the "Nightmares from the Deep" series, and that series is one of their best.  Just about everything in this casual adventure Hidden Object Game (HOG) is better than it is in earlier works:  graphics, voice acting, and story.  Best of all, we aren't forced into a second full playthrough to get 100% Achievements.  A single playthrough on Expert plus doing the first three HOGs as Majhong in a second partial playthrough can get us everything.  Yay!  My only complaints (and they're very minor) are that I hate the daughter (which has been true in all three games of the series) and they have too many Fractured Object Games (FROGs).  I defnitely prefer HOGs to FROGs.\n\nIt took me 7.3 hours to get through the main story and an additional 1.9 hours for the Bonus chapter.  So, 9.2 hours of very good gameplay makes the game worth buying even at it's list price.  Of course, I bought it on sale :) .","August 23, 2015","true","12.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

And some achievements require you to find 3 objects in 3 seconds or find all objects with only 4 misclicks or less in the hidden object scenes. There are also collectibles to find through the different sceneries but the good thing is you can always backtrack them as long as you don't give the medaillon to Davy Jones.\n\n(#):\nAs I said in the key features, you need two playthrough to finish the game. One to finish the game with all the puzzles and hidden objects scenes perfected and another one playing the mahjong game instead of the hidden objects scenes. The good thing is you can skip all the cutscenes and puzzles in your second playthrough if you succeeded your first one and in this sequel you only need to finish 3 mahjong instead of all of them in the previous games.","April 15","true","5.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

The plot's also better here, with a really strong ending surprisingly. As usual, the voice acting's shaky, the art's gorgeous, the extra puzzles thrown in are nice without being too tough (though one of them outright broke on me my first time through and I had to skip it, ugh), it's not too hard of a game but it's well-made and pleasant. Playing one of these games every few months is just a good way to unwind and relax, y'know?

This one was a good game for sure, a nice conclusion to the series. I didn't like as much as the 2nd personally so get them all and test it out yourself. No real complaints to mention just in comparison to it's forebearers wasn't as great of a romp in adventure land.\n\nCharacters, environments, music, art. Well crafted and interesting. Collectibles and bonus chapter for completion again which is always nice. I guess the pacing of this one for me was a bit different than the previous one.

Surpressing his beloved memories from the past, this sinister villain has hidden his greatest treasure on a cursed island where Sara Black's daughter must work as a maid.  Like one giant amusement park, the cursed island has 68 beautiful hand-drawn locations that not only attracts the audience's eyes but contain several similar objects, increasing the difficulty of finding these hidden items within the colorful scenery.  Yet, the biggest surprise is witnessing an advance 3D animation sequence during a zip-lining escape event from a pirate ship!

Since it's a trilogy they\ncould have found a more suitable voice actress for the main person I feel. Or maybe I just don't like her American accent.\n* The annoying daughter of the main character is back from the first story. Her voice is if possible even more annoying than in the first game.\n* Story could have been much better, but then it can in most Artifex Mundi games. It felt very cheesy and corny at times.\nThe base of it is good, but the way it is told.. I suspect this game is aimed at women, and it's annoying that they think\nwomen like these types of stupid stories with weak and badly explained plots.\n* Some of the solutions to puzzles are really stupid and far fetched, like that you should be able to use a file to make a\nscupltured object out of a log, or that you can just bang on a big heap of large rocks with a mallet to crush them.. Maybe\nit's just me, I don't have a problem with that it's possible to craft revival potions or magical artifacts in the game, but\nmy understanding of the game is that certain magical elements exists, not that laws of physics totally don't apply :P\n\nComment: I played it on casual difficulty. I don't recommend this game. Could maybe be worth it if you can get it on sale and want closure because you played the other 2 games in the series, but imo it was the worst of them. I'm dissappointed in this last game.\n\nGrade: 4.5/10","November 14, 2015","false","4.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

(Without Linux support from the publisher, this review would not exist.)\n\n- Outstanding graphics, both in "static" scenes (which aren't all that static, actually) and cinematic cutscenes. The cutscene transitions transport us seamlessly between scenes, without the "dissonance" caused by low-quality video in part 1 of the series.\n\n- Improved voice acting, compared to parts 1 and 2. It's the same woman for the primary character, and they did a good job of casting Davey's voice.\n\n- As in early episodes, the ability to "warp" between places using the map makes backtracking a non-problem.\n\n- They finally revealed the daughter's name. i don't recall her ever actually getting a name in the first two episodes.\n\n- There's a cute little dog running around in some of the scenes.\n\n\nThe bad:\n\n- This game might set the bar a bit too high, as far as HOGs go. i.e., i'm not sure i'll be able to like other HOGs much after this one, as they're likely to not be nearly as nice :/.\n\n- Collecting all achievements requires two play-throughs, and i'm highly unlikely to ever play any given HOG twice, no matter how much i like it (at least, not until i develop Alzheimers).\n\n- i find the standard price of 7-8 Euros for 6-hour HOGs to be a tick too high for today's market. i got this on sale with a bundle for the whole series, so i can't complain, but i would not have bought it at full price because HOGs are not a genre i can typically get into.\n\n- It's missing the "sonar" feature, which i relied upon heavily in episode 2 to find objects when the words are ambiguous or completely new to me. What _is_ a "garden fork" if it's not the same as a "pitch fork" (which it's apparently not).\n\n\nLet's add all that up...\n\nYup, the positives outweigh the negatives by a large factor. i.e., thumbs up.","March 27","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Standard Mundi fare - HOGs, puzzles, collect the trinkets for story fragments, creepy character animation, and extra hidden stuff.  On the plus side, there are no 'phasing' secrets meaning you won't have to stare at rooms for long, waiting for the secret to phase into reality; if it's to be found, it's in plain sight.\n\nYou would think that after two romps, the daughter of this series would learn how to not be stupid.  Sadly, nope.  The mother is too busy unleashing horrible piratey ghosts to be a decent enough parent to tell her daughter to you know, stay out of it.  But here's counting on her for being stupid yet again in the fourth game.","August 23, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From time to time you get those hidden object puzzles where you just have to find every item on a list. They are on a screen. I don't know if I should be triggered because there's a damsel in distress trope or should I not be triggered because I'm damsel's brave mom.\n","July 27, 2015","true","16.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Out of all three this one is my favorite HOG in the Nightmares series. In this HOG u will be learning secrets about the man that is behind everything Davey Jones himself.\n\nEverything was awesome about this HOG. The graphics are pretty, the music awesome, and the BG very nice. The VA wasn't the best. In particular Cory's VA was the one I didn't like. Thankfully Davey Jones VA I liked a lot:)\n\nAlso there is a bonus story to play:) The bonus story like the second in the Nightmare series takes place at the end of the game.\n\nAll in all u should not miss out in this amazing HOG.
