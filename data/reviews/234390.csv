"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Berq/recommended/234390/","Berq","Berq","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Berq/","248 products in account","EDIT: A week or two after writing my review, I finally beat Teleglitch DME.  In the process, I learned something that affects my review: it seems the charm of Teleglitch is the way that it becomes your gaming Arch-Nemesis.  It mocks and sneers at you while committing heinous crimes, daring you to stop it.  You become driven by your hate to defeat it... and hate keeps a man alive.  Or at least refusing to stay dead.\n\nNOTE: The following is not a simple "buy/don't buy" review, but more of an investment guide. There's a "buy/don't buy" verdict at the bottom, but it doesn't make much sense without the review.\n\n================THE REVIEW================\n\nYou've probably heard two things about Teleglitch: it's a rogue-like, and it's hard.\n\nThis is an exaggeration and underestimation, respectively.  Teleglitch is a rogue-like only insofar as the rooms are arranged differently each playthrough, and it's hard like a diamond ball bat to the groin.  Let's examine these points in more depth, because there are some things you need to know.\n\nOnce the awe of random level layouts (sarcastic "ooooh! aaaaah!") wears off, you'll quickly start to notice that every game of Teleglitch is essentially the same.  The items you receive on any given level are the same items you'll ALWAYS recieve on that level.  The question is whether or not you'll find them BEFORE or AFTER that room where you always get mobbed by that one enemy type that's always in there.  End result: each game of Teleglitch is unique in only the most superficial way.  And because you will die SO MUCH, the whole thing quickly becomes tiresome and repetitive.  This repetition wouldn't be a bad thing if, like many other rogue-likes, there was some incremental GAIN or REWARD at the end of each game.  But there isn't.  The recipe for success in Teleglitch is 5% experience, 10% luck, 25% resource conservation, and 70% ninja master reflexes.  Yes, that adds up to 110%, because if you give less, you will FAIL.  That brings us to the second topic.\n\nI know what you're thinking: "Oh, but I'm the exception.  I have superior gaming skills.  I'm sure Teleglitch will be easy enough for me that I won't want to BRAIN A KITTEN in frustration."\nNO.  You are NOT special.  Well, maybe to your mom.  Lemme hit you with some cold, hard statistics.  Literally NINETY NINE POINT ONE PERCENT of players never beat the game.  But that's setting our sights too high.  What are the odds that you'll give up before even beating level THREE?  of TEN!?\n\n91.3%\n\nThat's right.  You have less than a ten percent chance of making it less than a third of the way through Teleglitch before refusing to ever play it again.  Some games manage to find the recipe for making brutal difficulty enjoyable.  Teleglitch's brand of hard is more like a basketball game between an NBA team going all-out and a team of middle school girls with Down Syndrome.  Sure, it sounds amusing at first, but only the truly sick fail to quickly realize it's just in very poor taste.\n\nOh, and it also has bugs that can cause you to die, just in case you were legitimately doing well.\n\nHonestly, I really want to like Teleglitch.  Instead I just friggin' hate it.  Yet for some reason I'll probably play it another 20 hours.\n\n================END OF ORIGINAL REVIEW================\n\nDo I still hate Teleglitch?  Yes.  But it is a hate tempered with respect.  And... I... kinda like it.\nWill I change my recommendation to "Yes"?  No.  You should still be afraid of Teleglitch.\n\n"So you're saying I shouldn't buy Teleglitch?" you ask.  No.  I'm not saying that.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: should you buy Teleglitch DME?  Absolutely, but only if you don't have a kitten.","November 12, 2014","false","68.6"," 359 of 438 people (82%) found this review helpful 161 people found this review funny","82","359","438","161","16"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dtox508/recommended/234390/","dtox508","d.Tox508","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dtox508/","217 products in account","First off, the only way to describe what was running through my head when I first started playing Teleglitch was “WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥?!!?” Saying that, this indie roguelike from developer Test3 Projects rabidly eats your half alive corpse and then spits it out leaving you wanting more. Strangely addicting, you find yourself drawn to Planet Medusa 1C left in awe by the pixellated madness that is Teleglitch. So strap up and make every shot count, and I’ll tell you why this is one of my top 5 picks of the year.\n\nTeleglitch is one of those games where watching “Lets Play” with some youtube ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bag in his mothers basement isn’t going to suffice. Best played with a keyboard and mouse,  this top down shooter is reminiscent of GTA but put together with the savage intellect of a guerrilla militia planning its next terrorist move. To be honest, I was standoffish when it came to this game at first, it didn’t catch my eye, and I wasn’t really sure what it was all about. During a sale on Steam I was able to purchase Teleglitch for a good price and give it a chance, and I’m glad I did. After getting the hang of this game I felt like Rick Grimes or Daryl Dixon on a rampage blowing off zombie’s heads and throwing pipe bombs at anything in that got in my path.\n\nIn a cold, dark future dominated by mega-corporations, a place 30 light years away from Earth, Planet Medusa 1C is on the edge of habitable space and the site of a shadowy research facility specializing in necrotic tissue reactivation. You are a scientist who has suddenly awoken to the realization that you are the lone survivor. The rest of the facilities personnel have all been killed, micro-chipped and reactivated as combatants by the facilities central processing AI. An in-depth storyline keeps you constantly informed of your surroundings and almost adds a sense of excitement through your adventure. The story of Teleglitch continues throughout each level and grows deeper and more involved as you progress on your quest.\n\nThis game is hard and involves a lot of tactical thinking on the fly. An advanced crafting system helps you build explosives among other various weaponry based on the materials you collect throughout each level. You are also able to craft other tactical items like the Detector which helps you locate enemies on the map in close quarters where you would otherwise be ambushed.  Combining health kits or different materials can result in health upgrades or even steroids. These crafted items are a key element of Teleglitch making later gameplay almost impossible without them. The map is another vital piece of gameplay and by using it as a constant reference I found that it not only allowed me to keep my bearings but also helped keep track of any missed rooms I may have passed on the way. You will also encounter databases that hold crucial information regarding your mission, or maybe some tactical advice regarding secret locations which also make up a large part of the game.\n\nThe “Die More Edition” of this game alters gameplay slightly making each of the enemy creatures slightly more powerful to increase difficulty, as well as offering more weapons and items to craft with. Weaponry is a large part of the game, but in a small way. On Medusa 1C there is a lack of ammunition so every bullet counts and depending on what you are wielding you may not put down what is attacking you in one shot.  Without the “Guns & Tunes” DLC you start off with the standard 9mm pistol, then with continued play you are able to find more ammo and other weapons or explosives. Something that sets Teleglitch aside from other roguelikes of its kind is the unique crafting system I had mentioned earlier, and with this you are also able to build upgrades to your guns, which gives them more power or a special ability.\n\nSome might think the pixel graphics in Teleglitch belong in 1981 but I look at them and see a visual masterpiece. Nostalgic, with flawless gameplay that keeps you on the edge of your seat Teleglitch is an amazing example of a simple pixel game that took it to the next level. Seemingly so basic, Teleglitch is a breath of fresh air to the retro movement and another essential in the library of any indie game. Like many roguelikes the map and environment change with every new game. Thousands of zombies and mutants deliver hours of gameplay making this game another instant classic and comes highly suggested to any gamer.","November 28, 2013","true","17.1"," 112 of 130 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","112","130","0","1"

Your ♥♥♥ will be spanked so hard your great grandchildren will feel it. 11/10 made me rethink about my life as a gamer.\n\nI got this game when it was being offered for free, and was excited to try what I knew to be a super difficult rogue-like. I had gotten my feet wet playing Binding of Isaac, and was hungry for more brutally difficult games.\n\nWow, was I in for a surprise.\n\nIf you like unforgiving, brutal gameplay, dying a lot, top-down action, being mobbed over and over, and dying a lot, then you will probably rage at this game (and possibly enjoy it). Oh, did I mention you will die a lot? The game is labelled: Die More Edition because you will die more times in one hour than in most other games you have played before.\n\nThe aesthetics are rather simple and reminiscent of old-school, top-down pixel games. The different effects (weapon, item, etc) are very well done - the "stimulant" effect is really nice, making the screen look a bit erratic until the drug wears off. There is no music, but the sound assets are pretty good - especially the explosions. Much of the story is given through text, and more is available for people who choose to explore. The story is interesting enough, however, I have not advanced far enough in the game to account for more than 20% (or less) of it. The furthest I've progressed is to level 4, where I died almost immediately to an endless swarm of varying enemies. Fun times.\n\nThe controls take a bit of getting used to, especially considering that you need to be able to do things very quickly, while simultaneously dodging, running, and attacking. It is playable with a controller, but I prefer the keyboard and mouse in this case. Gameplay is very fast-paced once enemies spot you, and the learning curve is minimal to extreme - highly dependent on your experience with rogue-likes and how far you progress in the game. There is a tutorial mission that shows you everything you need to know - I highly recommend you play through this first. Teleglitch is not a pure rogue-like - the items found in each level are not randomized (only the layout of the map is) - so you will eventually be able to plan out which item combinations to use/save as you become more familiar with the game.\n\nDuring gameplay, you must move through different rooms until you find a teleporter to transport you to the next stage. Sometimes, there will be a branching point (two teleporters, left and right), allowing you to select which stage to move on to. There is an insane amount of repetition here because the only thing that really changes is how each level is presented - the items stay the same. Also, the checkpoint system is very unforgiving, as you must reach stage 5 in order to start a new game at stage 3 (and so on).\n\nMuch of the game involves combining items that you find (ex: combining C4 and a can to make a one-shot RPG) to help you survive each level. Because of this, it is highly recommended that you explore as much of each stage as you can. Herein lies the double-edged sword - the more you explore, the more enemies you will encounter. Healing items and ammo are not common enough to allow you to recklessly run through the level, so finding a balance between exploring and saving items is key to success in Teleglitch.\n\nAs a top-down action game, you will have to also deal with field of view - if you are standing in front of a pillar, for example, you will not be able to see anything directly behind it. This encourages you not to run into a room guns blazing, as you may be ambushed from all sides (the enemy AI is very good at swarming tactics). A personal technique I prefer using is to quickly double-back into a narrow hallway, allowing you to funnel the enemy into your line of fire (very cost effective, considering the rarity of resources like ammo and health). Aiming is a bit tricky in the beginning, but with time, you will become more proficient. Also, you will (hopefully) learn the melee range of different opponents - it is very dangerous to try to melee more than one enemy at a time, trading HP until one of you dies.\n\nThere is an Arena mode that adds more playability (especially if you intend to achieve 100% completion). Each Arena mission requires you to perform different tasks like survive for x seconds, kill x enemies, etc. There are different equipment loadouts for you to select, and I highly recommend trying this out to help you learn which weapons/items are more suited for your playstyle. For example, the automatic pistol is a great anti-mob weapon, however, I personally prefer the slower, more accurate revolver (also has less ammo before needing to reload). As a result, I tend to keep the pistol, over upgrading it to an automatic pistol. You can drop items and equipment - dropping a weapon allows you to transfer any ammo inside it to another same-calibre weapon (ex: drop auto pistol to transfer ammo to your regular pistol). One of the first upgrades you will find in the campaign mode is the automatic pistol combo, so trying both variants will help you determine which one is a better fit. As a rule, I tend to stay away from any planted explosives, as I tend to get caught in the blast radius (and HP is your most important resource). To heal, you can use medkits and canned meat, however, canned meat and explosives (weird, I know) can be combined to give you stimulants - recommend you try it out at least one to experience the cool visual effects.\n\nThere is one environmental hazard to be aware of - parts of each level may have time distortions (you'll know what it is when you first see and hear it), and touching one will cause you to instantly die. Don't bother trying to bait enemies into it - they're not that stupid, and it's quite impossible.\n\nOverall, Teleglitch is a great top-down (not-so-quite)rogue-like game that will challenge any and all gamers. If you are interested in the genre, you must give it a try.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","April 13, 2015","true","2.8"," 95 of 108 people (88%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","88","95","108","33","1"

Death in the game is but a mechanism to reinforce what works and what doesn't as you try to advance and conserve both your health and ammo as much as possible for the harder challenges that lie ahead the further you progress. The graphics have more in common with the atari 2600 than modern 3D engines but the game is all the better for it, giving you just enough information to properly play it and acess threats and recognize your surroundings but leaving your imagination to wonder about the finer details, and for that it does a much better job than any 3D accelerator could ever hope for.\n\nThe game has crafting and other aspects though it really is that kind of game you want to master and beat and be able to say... yeah Teleglitch... I finished that baby and I'm a better man for it. Even has a nifty story/lore told through text boxes from displays and data entries from terminals all over the place.

All the levels are semi-generated (same rooms, but in different order), there's lots of items, and decision making heavily impacts your gameplay. Are you going to keep your pistol or turn it into a nailgun? how about a cannon? every item you get can be used for multiple things, and making these decisions.\n\nThe magnet for example, with this you can either build an armor piercing railgun or a bullet reflecting magshield. Different approaches and strategies call for different items, and finding that sweet spot between choices is very enjoyable.\n\nLike most roguelikes, some elements are random each time you play. This is different in Teleglitch. The starting level is almost always the same, due to the fact that the same items and amount of enemies are always found. This changes in later levels though, where more choices and customization are given. 2 level choices are given after the 1st area, each holding differently placed items and enemies. After this, level choice can impact major aspects. The playthroughs might start out similar, but no 2 games will ever end the same.\n\nTeleglitch is a fun, time-consuming, tough as nails roguelike that's worth at least some time. I don't recommend it to anyone who can't take a hard challenge. Only 0.7% of players actually beat the game, and the 2 or 3 difficulty curves can really push away some players.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/234390/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Creepy, intense, and challenging, this is a worthy entry in both the roguelike and survival horror genres. Posed like a top-down Doom (or perhaps Quake), Teleglitch sends you through branching, randomized levels, forever dreading what's around the next corner. The top-down perspective is based on lines of sight, so anything not directly in view of you is blotted out by thick, sharp shadows. You start with naught but a pistol and knife, but over the course of the game you collect weapons, ammo, and other junk that can be combined into a huge assortment of gear to help you survive.\n\nAnd you'll need it, because NOTHING in Teleglitch holds back. You'll be facing waves of mutants, zombies, cyborgs, robots, and far more exotic things. While the first few levels pit you mostly against melee enemies, you'll soon start running afoul of gun-wielding foes that can drop you almost as fast as you can drop them. The limited sight lines become a real terror as you creep down the derelict corridors, tensed for the next shootout. It's one of those games that really, really makes you work to beat it, and it's SO satisfying when you finally pull it off.\n\nThis is one of those rare pixel art games that's ugly as sin, but once you start counting bullets in your clip and learning how to construct quad-barreled nailguns, you won't even notice. The minimal graphic design does do it some favors, leaving effective elements of horror to your imagination. The sound design is incredibly on point, with ominous cues and snaps of static in just the right places. And if you like the combat, they even added a series of arenas to blast your way through. There's a lot of secrets to discover, a lot of monsters to fear, and a lot of ways to mow them down.

I had figured it would be just another generic top down view shooter. But i was way wrong. This truly is a masterpiece of a game. The combat is fun and challenging as hell,  but the controls are as tight as can be so if you lose, you lost because of you. The enemies come at you in swarms, and it really sucks you in and makes you panick when a hoard of them are running at you. Its so easy to die, but yet you dont feel like youre being overpowered, just that you need to play better.\n\nThe storyline is fairly interesting. In this day and age just about everything has been done, so you would be hard pressed to come up with something completely original, but this developer sure as hell took his best shot at it. Most games i just click right through the walls of text, but not this one. Its worth the read.\nTheres a sort of crafting ability within the game as well. You can take different objects and combine them, for instance, i found an empty can, some nails and some explosives and well, whaddaya know? A nail bomb!\n\nThroughout 2013 theres been quite a few indie games that have seriously surprised me in terms of quality and replayability. This is DEFINITELY one of them. If my ridiculously long backlog doesent divert my attention elsewhere, i think im going ot be on this for quite a while.\n\nif you are looking for more info on Teleglitch to make the decision whether to buy or not, it basically comes down to this....

(There's a reason they call it Die More Edition) Each map is full of secrets and rather nicely-realised graphics - though some of the assets could do with a little more detail, such as some of the pipes and the flooring.\n\nAmmo and weapons are very scarce, so you need to make every shot count - otherwise you're left with a knife and your own patience. There are a variety of guns as well as a bevy of things to stick together to create something better - for example, if you find 12 tin cans, you can make 2 plates which can then be made into an armour vest. It's important to look around for bits of stuff to make useful things out of - but, again, beware the nasty mutants. Many of them knock off as much as 10hp per hit, and bearing in mind the game has perma-death, this is rarely a good thing.\n\nAnd the titular teleglitches dotted around the maps make the most horrific noise - sounds like the very fabric of reality is being tortured, which it essentially is.

It's brutally hard, I still haven't been able to get to level 7 yet (I probably need to use to learn the knife better), but you rarely feel cheated from your many, many deaths.  Like Nethack, all your problems could have been avoided in hindsight.\n\nThe graphics of the game, while extremely rudimentary, actually add to it; I love how much horror shows through, even though the monsters and worlds are just a few blurry pixels.  The storyline is interesting, and vividly describes the terror of the world you're living in, with a touch of humor as well.  If you're not interested in reading the computer logs to know how things got they way they are, they're also completely avoidable, and never forced upon you.\n\nAll of the monsters have their own unique personality (and freaking TRICKY movement patterns!  Those stupid small ones, yeeeeeaarrrgghhh!), and none of them seem repetitious, or rehashes of earlier versions.\n\nThe best part about this game?  THE CRAFTING SYSTEM!  Holy heck, I wish EVERY crafting game was as intuitive as Teleglitch.  Instead of needing a wiki article explaining how to make things you'd never have known exist, all you do is press a single key, and the crafting menu pops up, showing your entire inventory, what can currently be crafted from it, and what each of those items will cost you, using an easy to follow line diagram system.  Crafting is so easy, it can be done on the fly, during fights!  It couldn't be improved upon, except possibly to see items you can't craft yet, so you know what they take, but IMO, that would take away from the fun of discovery in the game, and add very little.\n\nTeleglitch is a game I'll always be happy to own, and if I had somehow pirated it (why? it's SO cheap!), I would actually pay money for a retail copy to support the designers.  I collect games like they're little works of art, and am proud to display this in my collection.","August 1, 2014","true","537.1"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","27","29","0","3"

It accompanies the expected top-down perspective with the well recognizable pixel art style common for indie games in a dark atmosphere of industrial machinery and desolation. Same applies for the audio design - in-game music only consists of ambient noises found around the randomly generated levels.\nThe gameplay is rock solid and similar to first person DoS games where the arsenals and ammunition carried by the player defy physics, not to mention the achievable running speeds. The controls are somewhat specific, but can be learned rather quickly.\nThe difficulty and the challenge can be described as "tough, but fair" - risk of dying is surreal (as suggested by the name of the expansion), as enemies can drain your health in less than a second, and carelessly running into teleglitches will result in an instant death. On the flipside, starting from later levels and crafting second chance items can ease the blow of permadeath. The enemies are well balanced and are found in reasonable numbers, at which point it all boils down to the skill of making every single shot count and avoiding getting cornered.\nLevels and bosses are memorable enough, however the procedural generation seems lacking and at best, as the layouts and secret placements get predictable with lots of replays. Despite it being a shooter, ammo conservation, weapon strategization on the fly, planned resource crafting and an eye for secret areas are a must if one actually expects to beat this. Additionally, the story is pretty good and doesn't get in the way of the game.\n\nIn a nutshell, it's a hard, but rewarding kind of a game.","July 9, 2015","true","132.0"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

Mainly because it's hard. There are some things that you will only learn not to do once you have died repeatedly by doing them. And that can hurt, especially when you are a couple of hours into a run. Permadeath hits hard when the game lasts so long.\n\nBut that really steps the tension in this game up a level. The game does a very good job of making you scared, in a few ways. There's a clever viewpoint system that makes tight corridors feel claustrophobic and open areas make you terified of a redguard standing on the other side. I'm impressed by the sounds. At first I was dissapointed that there was no music, but I have learned that it really matters that you are listening out for footsteps, to tell whether there is a giant zombie on the other side of that door or a group of gunmen approaching. I feel that the ambiant sounds of the facility could be more detailed, however.\nWhen you are attacked and are not ready, it's a panic, which is the last thing you want to do. Switching through weapons, trying to remember which one still has ammo left over, trying to work out where to run that you aren't going to be swarmed, and firing off rounds and MISSING! Missing really hurts in this game. Ammo is scarce.\n\n\nOveral. If you don't want a tense, hard, painful, roguelike that punishes you for every mistake, this isn't for you. If you are willing to deal with that for the immensely satisfying experiance of finally beating those robots of doom, with 2 health left, healing up again and finding enough ammo to last you for ever, you'll like this. I really do. Favourite rogue-like. I think it really starts to shine when you actually get good at it.\n\nOh I'll give some advice too, for best enjoyment. I'd play the arena mode a fair bit first, so that you don't get disapointed that you died because you aren't used to the controls yet in your first few runs. Then i'd go into the 'story' and have some fun.","October 2, 2014","true","16.1"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

I cursed it initially. My attempts, feeble. Then you have an amazing run, and you realize it's actually possible to proceed. The mood, the environments, the story (if you're paying attention) are all quite macabre. Bird's eye view with an in your face sound. The crafting system is nothing short of genius with its ease and simplicity. The graphics are pixelated, and they add nicely to the overall creep factor going on here.\n\nAt its heart, this game is a brutal shooter with rogue/survival horror like elements. Not everyone will like this game due to its ridiculous difficulty. The onslaught is generally relentless and you're damn lucky if you have a moment to catch your breath and re-align yourself. Ammo and health and crafting supplies are few and far between and the further you go, the less you'll find.\n\nBut there is so much to this game. 40+ hours in and I'm discovering new items, enemies and weapons still.

Unfortunately the roguelike elements are minimal, with crafting being shruggable, the levels simply seem to be (literally) rotated per playthrough. The entire permadeath thing gets really rubbed in your face by leaving you generally naked against outnumbering opponents, with the only reliable way of combating them being firearms with sparse ammo, and a backup melee knife which puts you directly in range for the enemy's auto-attacks (and has a habit of missing, dem pixels). The game doesn't necessarily require you to wipe them out as you progress, but realistically you have to otherwise face the inevitable problem of being totally immobile in a swarm when you make a single wrong / non-psychic move.\n\nAnother fine case of "smells delicious, tastes like meh"\nThe cards at least provided me with a slight 'refund'.

Bear with me, I will explain why.\n\nLet us start with the bugs. Sometimes (fairly rarely) you'll find yourself locked in an area because the randomization algorithm screwed it up. Tough luck bro, start again. Much worse is the randomization of the enemies, which ***relatively often*** unbalance the game. For instance,an unjustifiable large number of enemies waiting you right by the first room of a new map. Nowhere to run, no pillar to hide behind, no means of defence - it often means "death in 2s" or "good bye all ammo and medkits".\n\nThat wouldn't be all that hateable if only you would be allowed to save at the end of each map. The game "checkpoints" allowing you to start at lvl 3,5,7 or 9 once you finish lvl 5,7,9 and 10 respectively. That is mostly a trap, however, since you start with a much inferior gear in a game where ammo is already scarce.\n\nI like a difficult game more than most (check my profile) and I have completed all the achievements (took me quite long), but this game just doesn't deserve permadeath in my opinion. If anything, there should be a "permadeath mode", for those who like a challenge - like me. Having to put up with the flaws of the randomization system while trying to learn how to play, learn which ammo is more useful against each enemy, all of this just makes this game sound overly pretentious, achieving very little or nothing and giving absolutely no satisfaction. It feels like the only reason the permadeath is there, is to make the game hard. The devs should tune down their tone.\n\nOther remarks\n- "It has Quake aesthetics!" did you mean "the colourpallete and nothing else"?\n- "Wow, this is a nice horror game!!": I feel zero sympathy for my 8 pixels protagonist, and not scared or tense whatsoever.\n- "But it has so many nice reviews!" I've seen an awesome explanation to this phenomena, too bad I can't find it. Teleglitch was given "for free" in a bundle, many people got it for the free cards. Those people reviewed with "good game" and "cool" and have around 3~5h gameplay.

That's about it. What you see is what you get, basically some cool particle effects and pixelly stuff with a limited selection of weapons, rather weak procedurally generated levels, and enemy AI that while interesting at first, isn't too challenging or intense.\nThere's not much content here, it's not like Binding of Isaac where there's an absolutely ludicrous amount of unlocks, items, and other stuff to keep you busy, it's a very slim product. It's like the developers created the engine, fine-tuned it, made a pretty great, responsive, and crunchy feeling run and gun, then just left it at that without actually developing content.\nYou'll enjoy a runthrough or two, but it's really just not that compelling. The atmosphere is nice, but the writing is dull and basically everything about this game is dull.\n\nLack is the word, just lack, lack of a soul, like me, that's why I'm marrying Teleglitch.","December 8, 2013","false","1.4"," 31 of 51 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","31","51","0","0"

My head hurts.. I gain my footing and look around. I realize where i am. Im out of food, and today is the day i have to leave this room... into the unkown outside that door. I pick up the empty cans of my canned meat, they may prove useful to crafting new weapons, or bombs.... maybe armor if i need it.. ill need a lot more than 4 cans to accomplish that however. "rrrttt" The metal door slides open. i push away the benches, desks, boxes and what not and walk tward the exit of the long room ive  just entered.\n\nRoom 1: I walk out and see grass, from the organics garden. "At least we have a little bit of earth here with us..." i say to myself. I then hear an eerie gurgle from behind the pillar to my left. Then i see it, one of our old military AI mutants... its scuttling twards me pretty fast, but a few precise stabs will take it down. It is feet away now, and i take a step back as it crosses me, i stab it once, it hardly staggers. Its  hurt, and bleeding. it strikes at me and scratches my arm, so i retaliate and stab it again, this time in the head. It falls dead. Im glad im ok... but i already know... theres plenty more where that came from. i see a door ahead, and to the left. I enter the one ahead. It should be the teleporter room.\n\nRoom 2: I can see now that the particle from the other side of the universe that we teleported here... was lethal in its own right. It must have a way to control our AI... and mix the rooms of the building completly ♥♥♥ backwards. This is not how it was when i barracaded myself in that room. This just a generator room, with a crate. I decide to open the crate... AND LOW AND BEHOLD A SHINNY SHOTGUN! I raise it into the air with joy and begin to cry softly. After my cry i leave, theres nothing left for me in that room.\n\nRoom 3:Oh hell, there are several muntants in here... INSERT SHOTGUN INTO ARMS. "Blam!" "Blam!" Peices of them remain on the floor... Some still twitching... the blue liquid is everywhere.\n\nRoom 4 : CANNED MEAT AND A TUBE\n\nRoom 5: Im not sure what this room is, some computers and glass walls........ More mutants, i begin stabbing the first one, and finish him with my hand gun. I equip my shotgun and take out the other three. Blue blood on me, the floor and the glass.\n\nRoom 6 : A crate with 9 mm ammo, and and agl-1 (Stickynade launcher) Once again, i begin to cry softly to the gods... if they exist i do not know. I may be losing my mind.\n\nRoom 7: I slaughter more mutants as they run aimlessly twards me... i laugh slightly as i realize they are no threat... because we didnt finish developing them completly.\n\nRoom 8: This room is more of a hallway but you get the point. I walk down with my hand gun drawn and ready. I hear a pitter patter of footsteps around this corner, i round it, and i make derect eye contact with a  zombie... They were people... then they died and we were given their bodies to insert micro chips into their brains. They then do as commanded. Like fleshy robots. It SRINTS full speed right for me. I shoot at it and miss the first time, Its almost at me by this point. So i spray and pray... I hitt it twice after a few bullets and it drops. Im a little beaten up but im ok. They smell of turpintine.\n\nRoom 9: The teleporter room... finally. I enter the abandonned sector... hoping to not see any more mutants.\n\nFLOOR  2: I feel fuzzy from the teleport but im alright. I search the room and find nothing of use.\n\nRoom 2: I enter yet another room with two generators, and two ways to enter another part of the room, i take the left way and out comes some mutans, no problem as to blowing these ones away, they are predictable... and somewhat slow. I go the other way and find another crate, with a nail box, and some more cans. So i throw some of the explosives i had in a can and dumpped the nails inside. Creating a nail bomb... just in case.\n\nRoom 3: I enter this room and imediatly get hit in the face by a big gray mutant...these ones are bigger, they actually hurt, and they have 6 legs instead of 4. I pull out my shot gun and fire, miss it twice and reload. It begins to pund my body and head as i stagger away trying to reload. I finish realoding a t hit in the body two good times and it drops. Releived that i didnt die, i ate some canned meat to fill up a bit. As i beganto leave IT STAND BACK UP and begins to hit me several time in the face.. i lift my shot gun and shoot it more time than neccisarry... but i was making sure this time.\n\nRoom 4: another room with a crate in it. I open said crate and begin to sob quietly to myself. as i reach down to retreive my child... the heavy rifle. With rounds still in the mag, i couldnt be happier.\nWith my rifle readied and my nerves shot, i begin to enter the next room. As the door slides open i see something truly horrifying. A big brown mutant with a giant rock... looking right at me. HE winds up and launches the rock at me, i attempt to dodge, but i fail, and it hits me in my left arm. The pain is serious but i can still shoot. I shoot it twice with the rifle and i see 4 to five mutants run in front of him... all coming for me. I trun to run but find myself in a corner. As i turn around they are on me, The big brown mutant as well, He hits me once in the face and i can feel my jaw break. the green mutants tearing aaway at my skin. And in that moment i reach into my pocket and arm my nail bomb. My last thought were of my love... may she live happily without me.\n\n\n10/10 would take them all to hell with you","November 30, 2015","true","11.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","10","12","4","0"

That's a play on words, based on the ever-present black goo that engulfs every corner of this game. But seriously folks, I have put in quite a bit of undocumented hours into Teleglitch: Die More Edition and have yet to beat it. So my perspective is from someone who hasn't beat level 6 yet.\n\nI say it's an anomaly, because so many reviews describe it as repetitive, esoteric, self-indulgent, and impossible, and yet so many describe it as more horrifying and entertaining than any other game they've played. From my point of view-- it's a little of both. But, in the end I side with the latter.\n\nSet in a science facility on an uninhabitable planet, placed on the outer reaches of known space. A black gyrating void has breached the compound and corrupted the facilities AI, using the armed robotic soldiers, necrotic tissue specimens, and multi limbed plankton monsters to purge the planet of any human life. Except they missed one... you. As an engineer, living off of canned food for weeks in a broom closet, you leave your haven to find the master teleporter to send you back to Earth. There is only one problem. You have to navigate 10 randomly generated levels of monster and robot infested hallways and courtyards, teleporter by teleporter, until you reach Earth. When you die-- you die. Fortunately, there are chests, hidden caches, and monster dropped equipment to help you along the way. And being an engineer has its perks, like being able to improve your weapons and make devices to warn you of any impending dangers, or shell any impending dangers, or set exploding meat traps for any impending dangers. Did I mention this game has IMPENDING DANGERS?\n\nSometimes, I just want to end my life after some impending dangers end my hard work, over and over again. It's gets grating after awhile, like the devs designed it to never be beaten by anything that can competently operate a keyboard and mouse. Yet, many have done it... there is hope.\n\nBottom line is, buy this game. Play through that "This game is too ♥♥♥♥ing hard!!!!!" phase that all of us go through, and learn how to invest time and thought into making your next move, as if you were really stuck on a planet full of impending dangers.\n\nUPDATED REVIEW:\n\nSince my review I have reached level 9. I stepped away from the game for a week and returned with the passion of a thousand fires and slowly worked my way up. Defeating the Heavy Destroyer Snake is almost muscle memory now, and the Blue Walker even easier. How did I achieve success and guaranteed advantage to eventually beat the game?\n\nArena.\n\nThe weapon combinations in Arena help prioritize which builds you want for certain enemies with each passing level. Plus, it gives incentive to use explosives like the nailbomb, which is the Deus Ex Machina of ammo conservation, otherwise a very overlooked piece of arsenal.\n\nI could go on, but the most important thing I learned during this last bout is that this game is not for casual gamers. It's a game of passion, that separates those who enjoy building twitch skills through negative reinforcement, and those who would rather... I'm not sure how to end that actually. Who wouldn't want to build up their skills?\n\nIn an interview, test3 developed the game with testing and building their gaming skills in mind. Roguelike games, and "grind like" games like the Souls series are what keep me interested in gaming, and these kinds of projects draw the line between people who want to game, and those who want to run their thumbs over their phone screens like they're rubbing one out.","May 2","true","50.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Metal grating against metal, scratches echoing across the open cultivated on-base gardens. All it takes is one zombie with a really good ear to come investigate and with it comes a dozen more. All filled with inhuman rage, all hungry. Fitting that my armor plating is constructed of Militech’s ration cannisters hammered together.\n\nThis game does not ♥♥♥♥ around. Through each of its 15 stages (10 stages with 5 alternates) it'll force you to scavange as much weaponry and seemingly useless junk as you can without letting your guard down. All it takes is one wrong move and you're dead, back to square one. Strap some tubes to your guns and make them shoot more boolits, drizzle meat and bloody juices over a plastic explosive to create a savory trap. Enjoy a flexible crafting system while also learning why it was a bad idea to convert your weapon without any proper ammo.\n\nThis is what it would be like if Quake 1 running on software render mode got together with Hotline Miami and they both wanted to ruin your day over and over again after watching Alien a couple of times. Play smart and be ready for all manner of things that want you dead - from reanimated corpses to giant robot squids with laser weaponry and more. They'll come at you fast and by the dozens.\n\nThis is easily the most terrifying game to come out this year.

Any sense of familiarity is your enemy just like the inhabitants of the level, because you can never be sure what's past the next doorway.\n\nThe graphics and audio are minimalist and retro, reinforcing the game's bleak theme very well. At times, they can begin to feel repetitive, but if you're fretting about that while playing you're probably not focusing on your own safety and will soon die.\n\nThe UI feels unpolished at first glance but it does its job and fits the aesthetic of the game. There's something very visceral about putting together a nail bomb on the run from a horde of angry mutants, and the UI lets you get the job done. I do wish the HUD made vital information like health and ammo a little easier to see or highlighted it somehow.\n\nOverall, if you like feeling like you really earned every inch of progress you made, this is the game for you.","September 28, 2014","true","29.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

But on the whole the experience is very lacking.\n\nThe game tells you levels are procedurally generated, but the variation they do have is far more limited than you would think. Each level has the same rooms, just arranged into different places with some awkward hallways stringing them together.\n\nOther reviewers have commented that it's hard, but most any game can be made just as hard by removing any save functions. The overall effect of removing save points and deleting saves when you die was more tedious and frustrating that I have to slog through the same areas again. And again. And again. If that's your idea of fun I can only imagine what kind of abusive household you must have grown up in.\n\nAnother frustration, the knife (which you will have to use a ridiculous amount for a top down "shooter") does not automatically keep attacking. I had to download an auto-clicker just to spam left clicks for me because you will wear out your index finger and mouse in short order otherwise. If that sounds too technical for you or if you plan on playing on a console without a turbo button controller you should not buy this game.\n\nThe painfully low resolution makes it hard to even know what you're looking at, which in later levels when enemies start carrying guns will regularly prove fatal. The flavor text you pick up from terminals is probably my favorite part, but if I wanted to indulge my bookish side I'd be better served by ordering a book. At $15 it's hard to say it's not worth the price, but it certainly isn't worth the time.","June 20, 2014","false","5.5"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

The game is very hard, but fair. You have to learn through experience which weapons to use and how to best manage the crafting materials you're given. It is not exactly a roguelike though, because you can craft extra lives for yourself later on, and the items and enemies in each level are mostly fixed. The only random factor is how the pieces of each level get connected together and the locations of the items and monsters.

Another great feature is that it has checkpoints so you won't be spending 99% of your time playing the first couple levels (one of my major beefs with some roguelikes). I was also pleasantly surprised that a game like this would have Steam Cloud integration; started it up at work one day and I got to start at the checkpoint I left off from at from home! All in all Teleglitch is a great game that is well worth the price tag, especially if you get it during a Steam sale.\n\nMinor nitpicks for the developers (hoping some of these get patched in):\n-loading screens from the main menu to the selected checkpoint would be nice (maybe just the caption screen preceeding that level?) Even though it only takes 5 seconds to generate a level, it still feels weird when the main gui becomes unresponsive.\n-scattering dead enemy bodies around each level and having a few of them randomly get up would add to the scare factor\n-the story text needs a bit of proofreading; hell I'll even volunteer to do this given how few errors there are.","July 5, 2014","true","46.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I mean holy Jesus almighty on a pogo stick, this game is really hard. I've played this game alot, and still haven't made it though Level 6 out of 10. It is also utterly brilliant. It is a roguelike that gives the reward of experience and knowledge for your defeats, rather than new bonuses to help you on your next run. The best you can get is a checkpoint start at a later floor, and you are purposely underpowered if you choose to use this option. From when you start in the cold broom closet on Level 1 to when you are facing down the AI Core on Level 10, you are on your own. A bullet will kill you just as easily. The atmosphere of tension and fear that this creates is palpaple. Peeking around corners for huge minigun wielding zombies, running chased by swarms of taser armed robot drones, or locked in a room with hulking warwalkers, terror will be your primary emotion.

Teleglitch is somewhat of an exception to that rule -- it's hard to say if I'd buy it if it wasn't one a sale, but playing it is definitely enjoyable.\n\nFor starters, you've got randomized map every time you start over (and, as the title says, you're going to die a lot in this game), so it's really non-repetitive. The difficulty is rising with every level, so make sure to sweep the levels thoroughly.\n\nOne of the main features of the game is crafting. It has a lot of options (combining items, materials and weapons with each other gives a certain lot of total recipes -- not too much, around 50-60, of what I've seen). It's definitely fun to find out new recipes (by finding new items) and create weird weapons like a 6-barrel revolver.\n\nSpecial effects are something of a stronger suits of the game: there are neat chromatic aberrations when you're shooting your weapons or using some heavy meds. Even though the graphics are pretty oldschool and *meh*-ish, SFX are usually good and fitting.\n\nStoryline is pretty good too, if you're in here for a read (I know I'm not, though I've read some of the crew logs, and they were decent). Also, even though the bestiary is kind of bleak (6-legged mutants, fast zombies, you know that type), it fits the game's universe pretty good.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nIn conclusion, I think this game is a must-play for people who enjoy rogue-likes and isn't really exacting about the graphics (SFX are good, graphics overall -- not so much). Wait for a sale and get it for $3-4, game's definitely worth it.\n\nRating: 7.0 out of 10.0","June 8, 2015","true","0.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Especially since its free right now (until 11/25). Teleglitch is a top down retro shoot em up adventure game that has you frantically running from monsters while trying to explore every nook and cranny of every map, hoping to find something to help you survive a bit longer. Randomly generated maps plus perma-death is a perfect combination, so it doesnt feel like your repeating the same thing over and over again. Every moment in this game could be your last, as you burn through ammo and supplies, as the tables are turned and instead the enemies mow you down, relelntlessely attack you, slash after punch after shot, leaving you injured and running, shooting backwards, hoping to find a room with supplies to allow you to fight a little longer. The atmosphere is just perfect in this game, its a perfect balance between suspense, terror, and all out fun. Warning, this game is pretty difficult, as you could have guessed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannonesshannah/recommended/234390/","cannonesshannah","Katie's Hannah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannonesshannah/","979 products in account","Let me just start by saying that this is a game you'll either like or you'll hate.  It's very unforgiving and to be quite honest, like most roguelikes the random nature of the game can mean you may end up wasting entire swaths of your time just to get to a level that will absolutely punish you and you will die.  A lot of people have trouble with that kind of gameplay, while others find it rewarding.  This is more a commentary on the actual roguelike genre than the game itself however, but it is such an integral part of the game that I feel it nonetheless bears mentioning.  If you are the kind of person that gets frustrated by those kinds of games then this game is, without a shadow of a doubt, not for you.\n\nTeleglitch utilizes a very low-fidelity graphics style.  Given the sound design and the lack of music, I am inclined to believe this is a conscious gameplay decision.  While the sort of voxel design it has certainly does seem rather unique, I can't say it really clicked for me.  It just doesn't seem to have enough creative soul to it to justify that appeal.  It certainly does have a very kinetic feel to the gameplay and graphics both however, so that bit was nice.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics themselves, however, work very well and it truly does the sort of roguelike survival thing very well.  The gunplay is very simple point-and-shoot, however it does have line of fire mechanics that are done surprisingly well given the perspective, and each of the guns you have handle in a very different fashion.  Some of the more powerful weapons such as can bombs or the high explosives involve a very survival-esque risk/reward mechanic whereby you can use them and they will be very devestating to the enemies, but given the timing window they could also be very damaging to yourself if you do not use the weapon skillfully. I find there generally enough of a skill ceiling to the gunplay and crafting that I find myself playing more in spite of an aesthetic that I don't find pleasing, which is praise for the game if I ever heard any.  As well, the difficulty of the game is obviously something the developer has put some thought in.  The levels themselves may be random but the progression itself has obviously been carefully tweaked, and they have abated the frustration of having to start over by including what are essentially checkpoints in that if you get up to certain levels you can start over from a further point than the beginning.\n\nAll in all I would say that is a mechanically-well-designed game that is somewhat let down by a very sparse flavour to the aesthetic and theme.  I would still recommend it to someone that is a fan of that sort of roguelike however, as it is a very strong game in that genre.  It doesn't add anything terribly new or innovative, but what it does, it does very well.","February 6, 2014","true","63.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

And though my review is going to be entirely criticism, I do recommend it. Perhaps I should wait until I've beaten the game before I write this review, but I don't see that happenning within this lifetime.\n\nMy most major gripe is the Guard enemy. I appreciate how they transition the game from a leisurely stroll through the abandoned facilities to a nervous twitch-inducing slow crawl through every corridor, but they just seem too hard. I can't even count the times I've stepped out of the start point in level 4 with full hp and armor, only to suddenly find myself dead from the gang of three guards waiting on the other side. And when you're playing a rougelike where every death means starting all the way back at Level 1, it can be rather trying to die so instantaneously.\n\nEven the super cyber guys in Level 5 don't bother me as much as the Guards do, because you know what you're stepping into before you fight them. The Guards just pop up behind you and then death. Yes, you can wait at the edge of a room and wait for them to patrol past you, but honestly, camping a corner for 5 minutes to survive isn't quite my idea of a good time.\n\nIf I'm alone on this, then by all means, disregard all of my ranting. I may have just not gotten the hang of it yet. But if this holds any water, could I please request that their strength be dialed back just a little? Maybe boost the strength of the mutants and zombies to compensate, because honestly, I don't feel like most of them even in huge groups are even half a threat to my character. Or if not that, could the Guards AT LEAST have a noise to notify that they've spotted you? It would be nice to know if a zombie with a shotgun is about to pop up behind you and void your last 15 minutes of progress.\n\nTwo other small gripes:\n-Could we have a noise that sounds a little more terrifying when you're melee attacked? Becuase the one the game has now sounds almost comical.\n\n-Some ambient music would be nice.

Tension! Permanent death means every time you play you'll be at the edge of your seat. I have yet to find any other single player experience that quite matches this game's level of stress.\n\n2. Style! Yes, the graphics suck but the line of sight gameplay and low graphics mean that discerning and discovering foes becomes harder and adds to the game's difficulty factor.\n\n3. Weapons. The game has an awesome item combining system and you will be very happy to make that one super powerful weapon or other lifesaving item when you'd thought all was lost. Eventually you'll memorize some item recipes and forgo combining a particular item immediately in the hopes of finding that extra ingredient for making something more useful - all the while juggling your inventory to make sure you're not leaving items on the ground behind.\n\n4. Feedback. The developers have implemented a clever graphical trick into making all the weapons feel like they have a punch or at least a sense of personality. Firing a weapon distorts either the entire screen or at the very least distorts your character. This makes learning the intricacies of each weapon a skill and adds to the high level of skill you need to beat this game.\n\n5. Exploration and secrets. In an environment where death is permanent, finding anything useful becomes immensely valuable. Exploring each level thoroughly to find every secret area is thus very rewarding and adds nicely to gameplay.\n\n6. Randomization. Each level is randomized. Yes, there are some things which are key to each level that stay the same but most of the level is different each time you play. Different secrets, different enemy positions, different room locations etc. It all adds to the tension since you really never know what lies behind each door and each corner.\n\nCons:\n- no music (some tension creating music would have been nice)\n- graphics (a bit less pixelation would do the game some good)\n\nOverall this is one of the best games I've ever played (and I've played a lot of them). You owe it to yourself to challenge yourself to beating this game. It's one of the few which makes you proud to beat each level and possibly actually gives bragging rights if you manage to complete it.","June 14, 2015","true","30.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Oh my god, the shooting is amazing, the way it feels when you shoot a Rocket Laucher, or cangun is just sweet, the crafting is also incredibly intuitive, but I feel that for me to get drawn into such an experience I need just a  little  bit lenience sometimes. The worst thing was getting into level 3 and seeing the same type of enemies, but this time they shot you with guns, when you no time to react. That was pretty frustrating, to be honest. Another thing they could do to make it more interesting is make the checkpoints more accessible, because you pretty much have  to become a master of this game to get to the first checkpoint.

And though my review is going to be entirely criticism, I do recommend it. Perhaps I should wait until I've beaten the game before I write this review, but I don't see that happenning within this lifetime.\n\nMy most major gripe is the Guard enemy. I appreciate how they transition the game from a leisurely stroll through the abandoned facilities to a nervous twitch-inducing slow crawl through every corridor, but they just seem too hard. I can't even count the times I've stepped out of the start point in level 4 with full hp and armor, only to suddenly find myself dead from the gang of three guards waiting on the other side. And when you're playing a rougelike where every death means starting all the way back at Level 1, it can be rather trying to die so instantaneously.\n\nEven the super cyber guys in Level 5 don't bother me as much as the Guards do, because you know what you're stepping into before you fight them. The Guards just pop up behind you and then death. Yes, you can wait at the edge of a room and wait for them to patrol past you, but honestly, camping a corner for 5 minutes to survive isn't quite my idea of a good time.\n\nIf I'm alone on this, then by all means, disregard all of my ranting. I may have just not gotten the hang of it yet. But if this holds any water, could I please request that their strength be dialed back just a little? Maybe boost the strength of the mutants and zombies to compensate, because honestly, I don't feel like most of them even in huge groups are even half a threat to my character. Or if not that, could the Guards AT LEAST have a noise to notify that they've spotted you? It would be nice to know if a zombie with a shotgun is about to pop up behind you and void your last 15 minutes of progress.\n\nTwo other small gripes:\n-Could we have a noise that sounds a little more terrifying when you're melee attacked? Becuase the one the game has now sounds almost comical.\n\n-Some ambient music would be nice. The atmosphere in the game is already pretty solid, but doesn't always suit it during the more intense moments of gameplay.","May 28, 2014","true","23.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a harsh rough-and-tumble roguelike that pushes the player to paranoia and makes resource management the key between success and crushing failure.\n\nYou will die. You will die a lot. You will die far more than you expect you would in a top-down pixel shooter. The worst part is you're going to like it.\n\nThe atmosphere of Teleglitch: Die More Edition is what you would expect from the survival horror genre. It's a game that throws the player into an unknown environment that is just as hostile as the terrifying denizens within it. The game takes care to only let you learn more of the story as you get further in, hooking the curious by tempting them with computer logs and various records.  With each passing death, it's surmised the player is learning more about the creatures they fight and the situation they're in.\n\nMechancis-wise, the game is twitchy. Very, very twitchy. Players who are slow on the draw will find themselves growing thoroughly more and more frustrated, while those with jerky reactions will find out quickly that bullets are scarce, and inaccuracy is not an option that fits well with survival. Teleglitch will, unfortunately, get more and more frustrating with each respawn, until you finally have to pull away for a bit. That doesn't make it a bad game, but it makes it a very difficult one. Mostly because it should be so easy, and the blame falls very heavily upon sheer human error.\n\nDespite my grumblings, I'm recommending this game. It's a fun challenge, but in hindsight. So be prepared to grind your teeth as you grind through zombies and mutants, and be prepared to die more than you ever thought possible.","June 18, 2015","true","6.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Tension! Permanent death means every time you play you'll be at the edge of your seat. I have yet to find any other single player experience that quite matches this game's level of stress.\n\n2. Style! Yes, the graphics suck but the line of sight gameplay and low graphics mean that discerning and discovering foes becomes harder and adds to the game's difficulty factor.\n\n3. Weapons. The game has an awesome item combining system and you will be very happy to make that one super powerful weapon or other lifesaving item when you'd thought all was lost. Eventually you'll memorize some item recipes and forgo combining a particular item immediately in the hopes of finding that extra ingredient for making something more useful - all the while juggling your inventory to make sure you're not leaving items on the ground behind.\n\n4. Feedback. The developers have implemented a clever graphical trick into making all the weapons feel like they have a punch or at least a sense of personality. Firing a weapon distorts either the entire screen or at the very least distorts your character. This makes learning the intricacies of each weapon a skill and adds to the high level of skill you need to beat this game.\n\n5. Exploration and secrets. In an environment where death is permanent, finding anything useful becomes immensely valuable. Exploring each level thoroughly to find every secret area is thus very rewarding and adds nicely to gameplay.\n\n6. Randomization. Each level is randomized. Yes, there are some things which are key to each level that stay the same but most of the level is different each time you play. Different secrets, different enemy positions, different room locations etc. It all adds to the tension since you really never know what lies behind each door and each corner.\n\nCons:\n- no music (some tension creating music would have been nice)\n- graphics (a bit less pixelation would do the game some good)\n\nOverall this is one of the best games I've ever played (and I've played a lot of them). You owe it to yourself to challenge yourself to beating this game. It's one of the few which makes you proud to beat each level and possibly actually gives bragging rights if you manage to complete it.","June 14, 2015","true","30.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Think a more sophisticated Doom or Quake if they were isometric 3rd person rogue-likes instead of FPS.\n\nThe feeling of achievement and victory when beating a boss or challenging encounter is some of the best in any game ever.

Besides classic roguelikes this is the indie game where I sunk the biggest amount of time.\n\nThe gameplay (and the most thourough): The gameplay is teeeeense! Thanks to permadeath. The gunplay is great. I really enjoy the (lack of) accuracy in some weapons, forcing us to close in. I really enjoy the weapon variation in this game. The only completely useless weapon is the nailgun but I guess it isn't that useless to a newbie that preferes to avoiding taking matters in their hands.\nI am talking about the knife of course. Lots of players think that the first levels are tedious because we have to knife pretty much everything the fodder mutants. And maybe the reactivated zombie.\n\nThe variety of enemies is also amazing because they feel very different from each other with different patterns. I really love the bosses (wish there were even more bosses) and I liked that "surprise" in level 6. You know the one. As if I didn't need another reason to be tense.\n\nThe crafting is also a very important aspect of the game. I really don't feel the need to install mods that lets me dissessemble things because I already have pretty everything I need during the game. I need to try a mod sometime. But the thing is, the decisions that needs to be made regarding "Do I use this now or later? Should I drop something to take a mg-3600 with me to get highter chances of getting that minigun in the future? I won't really need this nailbomb do I?" Just wish there were more yellow items.\n\nThe Arena is also mad fun for someone that wants to kill mutants, reactivated units, bots without the concern of dying and running out of ammo. So very satisfying.\n\nThe randomness in this game gives me very fresh feeling runs one after another. You have no idea how much I would've played Metal Gear Solid or the Souls series if they randomly changed the enemy placements, this is the essential for a game with infinate replayability. Of course you went with the other roguelikes formula and you also randomly placed the map rooms and corridors. Simple but imensely effective. Which leads too...\n\nGraphics/Sound: Hell, it is not even simple, because then the devs went "Ok, so these are kinda static rooms so I guess we need to go ahead and give it some detail.". I wouldn't say that the graphics are bad. They just leave a huge amount to the players imagination. Hell, I know I spend some time imagine some of the sectos in the game. You made the right choice in going for a more developed sound. Hell, a cautious player will notice the guards ahead of time sometimes. The ambient sounds are geniously simple and effective as well. The lightning adds very well to the setting. Gotta love annoyingly blinking lights.\n\nStory: The story is simple, as a expected from a roguelike. The lore and writing however are PI level. Witty, fun, self-aware. I like the technobabble and the log texts and the descritptions. I really love the setting as well. The crazy zombie stories, the suicidal AIs, the mega corps.","November 12, 2014","true","76.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/caleblives/recommended/234390/","caleblives","Lead Shacks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/caleblives/","255 products in account","Probably one of the only games since System Shock 2 that's been able to get this kind of atmosphere and experience down, with you often scraping by bullet by bullet, smashing things together and scavenging to desperately try to keep moving and keep alive. If I have problems with the game they come down to the graphics, procedural generation and writing of the game, and they are somewhat intertwined.\nSystem Shock 2 was so terrifying because of the enemies being horrible mostrosities, perversions of what was once human flesh often now coupled with machine parts. Here, I feel like that's supposed to be the case, but I can't tell due to the simplistic top down style. This could likely be circumvented by having sound design that lets your imagination fill in the horrifying gaps for you, or writing for the datalogs you find to elaborate on the backstory of these things but no, that doesn't happen. The sound design seems to be content to the 8-bit aesthetic and the writing seems to be confused about whether it wants to be dead serious or a little tongue in cheek with its subject matter. I ended up skipping through most of the data logs given the total lack of personality or a good level of backstory handed out beyond the words "necrotic tissue reactivation" and "genetic tampering".\n\nAlso the procedural generation itself feels too cruel and really, really same-ey. The environment never really feels... I'd almost say navigate-able or "comfy". I don't expect it to feel Comfy obviously, it is a survival horror game, but it never really feels anything but stuck together out of different parts in a way that's jagged, lopsided and poorly balanced.\nThe reason resource management this strict works in games like System Shock is because the level design is manageable, it's obvious, and you can rely on things. You aren't going to end up luring enemies into a courtyard because the hallway feels so rough and fiddly to move around in that you will probably waste vital supplies.\n\nThis is a game that didn't need to try to be a roguelike or a procedurally generated game, or even one that needed to try to have a story.\nTeleglitch could have made itself into a pretty good linear top down sci-fi survival shooter with a decent story, but instead it throws in procedural generation on top of the already difficult resource economy of supplies v.s. dead enemies, which just pushes things too far.\nIt could have simplified and just been a fun procedurally generated shooter where you explore a randomly drawn up location and try to survive that's slick, mean and embraces the retro aesthetic further. I\n\nInstead it feels like it collapses under its own elements into a muddled mess of scrap metal, crafting, nails and ugly brown pixel art.\n\nMy recommendation: If you want to check it out, wait for a sale and don't pay anything under $5 for it.","December 28, 2013","false","2.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's a roguelike, so you'll die often and occasionally unfairly, but that's half the fun - shaking your fist at the computer before going in for another try.  The gameplay is extremely challenging but the learning curve is smooth and before long you'll push through areas that seemed impossibly difficult at first.  The crafting system is intuitive and leads to some interesting choices regarding how to make use of limited resources.  The developer is adding new features as we speak, and it feels like an excellent game already.

Considering the fairly 'primitive' graphics (although the lighting and some of the effects are really cool), Teleglitch does an amazing job at generating tension - with procedurally generated levels, no less.\n\nSpeaking of the proc-gen levels, it should probably be noted that the levels are only 'psuedo' proc-gen. You can expect some or all of the elements to appear in a given order and layout in a particular level in any play-though. I think this is a good thing, as it allows the player to develop a strategy for how to progress, but at the same time doesn't get boring on repeated playthroughs - which there will be many of it's a hard game.\n\nIf you like roguelikes, system shock-esque sci fi horror, arena shmups or a combination of the three, Teleglitch is worth playing.","June 22, 2014","true","21.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hylianchozo/recommended/234390/","hylianchozo","Autopilot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hylianchozo/","146 products in account","It didn't take long for me to absolutely love this game to bits. It seems simple - a difficult top-down shooter with zombies and pixel graphics. Seems pretty mainstream at the core.\n\nBut there's way more to it that makes it stand out from most other games in my eyes - that it has actual atmosphere. I can count the number of game franchises I've played with true atmosphere on one hand: Metroid, Fallout, Dark Souls, System Shock, and now this game. What is "true atmosphere"?\n\nI like to define it as ambience in a game to the point where it shrouds you in all sorts of mixed emotions, whether it be fear, cheerfulness, or isolation. In the Metroid games, you're alone on a planet and for the most part are the only "human" lifeform on it. The Fallout games you could argue don't really have true atmosphere, but what I'm talking about is the exploration part of the games (even the classic ones). Turn off the radio, go into the vaults or subway tunnels in Fallout 3/New Vegas, and you'll see what I mean. THAT'S true atmosphere.\n\nAnd it just so happens that this simple-looking game is a mixture of Metroid and Fallout, with a touch of the sci-fi from System Shock 2 and the difficulty/unforgivingness of the Dark Souls games. Despite how awful the graphics look in the screenshots, the game has a beautiful way of approaching its graphical style. It plays on the style of glitches on a screen, and makes those as realistic as possible. They contrast from the rest of the game's visuals, and as a result it adds something to the game that I can't really describe. The game doesn't really have music - it's all ambient sound, which is extremely realistic. For most of the game you'll be getting used to the hum of power generators, and it makes the setting both peaceful and ominous.\n\nThe gameplay itself is well-done. The controls may seem awkward at first, especially with a controller, but you get the hang of them quickly as your life depends on it. Literally. If you can't get the hang of the controls and get yourself killed, you have to restart from the beginning, hence why it's considered a roguelike. This motivates you to be careful about where you set foot, because a single stupid mistake can make you lose everything. You get more powerful as you go along, though. There's a crafting system in place that lets you combine various things you find in the levels - which are semi-randomly generated - to make improved versions of guns you find. This is extremely reminiscent of Fallout 3.\n\nAnother comparison I made to the Fallout/Metroid duo is that in both games, you find out the lore via exploration. In the Metroid Prime games you have to scan walls with alien text on them to get stories about the civilizations that once lived there. In the Bethesda Fallout games, a lot of the lore is learned from holotapes and working computers that you find around the Wasteland. In Teleglitch, you do the same thing. The game introduces you to the main story through an intro, but after that you have to read logs present on computers that you find in the various levels. And just as in the Fallout and Metroid games, sometimes the logs can have a dark sense of humor.\n\nIn conclusion, I HIGHLY recommend this game, otherwise I wouldn't have written such a long review of it. If you're looking for a creepy atmospheric survival shooter roguelike game, this will more than surpass your expectations. It's THAT good. Trust me, get it.\n\nNow.","September 5, 2014","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It throws you into a dark, mysterious place full of humanoid creatures trying to annihilate you, with only a few necessary things so you're able to survive at first, with many other items scattered around the facilities and hidden rooms. Teleglitch is a real hard game, and you should experience it yourself.\nThere's always the same way you start, but the way you progress differs with what you find and what you craft with it. You can craft almost everything you need to stay alive, from meds, through armors to deadly weapons and bombs. The game makes you reconsider your decisions often and economical with what you own, as it tends to be scarce with ammo and other items, so you pretty much need to examine every nook and cranny and decide whether to finish off a group of zombies with a bomb or a few shotgun slugs.\nThe atmosphere of the game is enigmatic, and you'll often find yourself discovering data logs which uncover more and more about the game's lore. There is no music, but for me, it only makes the game darker. The graphical style is rather simple, but neat, and the glitchy effects look really good. The informations about health, ammo or items you own are short and simple, as well as the interface.\nArm yourself with a lot of patience and time, because you're going to find yourself dying over and over. This isn't the sort of game for the weak, but as earlier mentioned, you should give it a try anyways. There's even a demo so you can easily see if you're prepared for the hordes.","June 28, 2015","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has fun gameplay with good shooting and easy crafting. The stranger the weapons the more fun they are because everyone wants a revolver with 6 trigers that fires every bullet at once. another thing to note is the cool way that things distort when you shoot or teleport. another thing I must complement them on is the fact that it feels really tense exspecialy when you are low on ammo.","December 15, 2013","true","10.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Teleglitch often laughs at your attempts to get further although that doesn't mean that you do not have a chance to succeed. The crafting system is simple to use and keeps you wanting to find more items to help you survive to the next teleporter. The story is what oozes from Teleglitch, a creepy undertone of experiments with time and space gone wrong. The mutants that prowl the corridors of the ship are experiments of war making it even harder to reach your destination. The ship's AI is even against you in some parts sending marines and personnell that have microchip implants to vanquish you. Overall the setting and difficulty of Teleglitch is what makes it shine as a great adventure game and an amazing rogue-like experience.","January 28, 2014","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

How the hell was i meant to see that coming!" and make you quit the game.\n\nIf this game isn't for you, you wil probably never play it again thinking it's a badly made roguelike with horrible graphics and no music.\n\nHowever, if this game is for you will eventually go back and think "Hey! I could hear the guards coming, and i just need to stay away from the pipes next time!" And that is when you're hooked.\n\nI was honestly amazed by how immersive this game is, despite looking like an early DOS era game with a few modern shaders in there, the actual experience of being completely alone in this horrible metal prison with nothing but a pile of guns and a whole lot of monsters from here until the end, is incredible.\n\nEverything in this game is done perfectly once you get past the learning cliff that is level 3, music will not work in this game as you need to hear every last grunt through the walls in order to plan out what's coming and when, graphics are pixilated with well made shaders as you need to focus on the game rather than the graphics.\nAnd the game couldn't be any easier otherwise you would feel like there is no consequence to your actions and guards/zed pipes cannot be introduced earlier as the player is even less prepared then, and cannot be introduced later as the enemies cannot transistion in time to their final forms (Guard<Red Guard<Scientists).\n\nAs for negatives, the restart system in this game really needs some work, in order to unlock the ability to start on level 3, you need to reach level 5! This means you need to repeat the same boring first 2 levels over and over again until you eventually learn how the guards and the pipes and everything can be exploited to save resources in the long run.\n\nLet me tell you, i am a big fan of permadeath games, I used to play realm of the mad god all the time until i got bored of it.\nIn that game you could store all your items in a vault for your next life as soon as you get them, this means you can reach the same point you were previously with only a progress cost to restarting.\n\nSo why does it not work like this in Teleglitch? Instead of getting easy access to the stages you need help on, you have to redo stages you've already completed multiple times and are no chalenge any more.\n\nSo overall the game makes a very poor first impression but if you stick with it you will find a rich immersive experience like no other.","February 7, 2014","true","39.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The crafting system is intuitive and leads to some interesting choices regarding how to make use of limited resources.

Then maybe Teleglitch is for you. From the very start, you’ll go about the usual roguelike style of killing and progression (no leveling here) and collect various materials which can be crafted into useful items, weapons, and even armor to help you progress through the game.\n\nCombat is a quick and dirty endeavor and typically will be resolved within a few seconds depending on various factors. I found using choke points and blind spots to be the best path to victory, as being able to fully unload on an enemy at point blank range (before they are able to retaliate) is a great recipe for success. I would also highly recommend that you get the detector and EM detector upgrade ASAP as being able to know where enemy swarms come from, as well as the location of entrenched opponents, is absolutely vital to your survival.\n\nOnce you get the hang of the overall combat and crafting systems, Teleglitch is a fairly straightforward game that rewards careful planning and precise execution (and punishes recklessness and haste!) It will definitely take you 10 or so deaths before you finally get the hang of the game. But, if you hang in there, you’ll be glad that you did.\n","October 9, 2015","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The enemies in the late game can kill you in a blink of an eye if you're not expecting them, but once you learn to listen for the audio cues they make, it becomes a lot more manageable. Which reminds me, turn your your sound up in this game, it'll make your life exponentially easier.\n\nOverall, Paradox did a very good job with this one.

It throws you into a dark, mysterious place full of humanoid creatures trying to annihilate you, with only a few necessary things so you're able to survive at first, with many other items scattered around the facilities and hidden rooms. Teleglitch is a real hard game, and you should experience it yourself.\nThere's always the same way you start, but the way you progress differs with what you find and what you craft with it. You can craft almost everything you need to stay alive, from meds, through armors to deadly weapons and bombs. The game makes you reconsider your decisions often and economical with what you own, as it tends to be scarce with ammo and other items, so you pretty much need to examine every nook and cranny and decide whether to finish off a group of zombies with a bomb or a few shotgun slugs.\nThe atmosphere of the game is enigmatic, and you'll often find yourself discovering data logs which uncover more and more about the game's lore. There is no music, but for me, it only makes the game darker. The graphical style is rather simple, but neat, and the glitchy effects look really good. The informations about health, ammo or items you own are short and simple, as well as the interface.\nArm yourself with a lot of patience and time, because you're going to find yourself dying over and over. This isn't the sort of game for the weak, but as earlier mentioned, you should give it a try anyways.

If you screw up - it's your fault because the game gives you everything you need to beat it, it's just hard not to screw up at times. One second you're fully stocked on ammo, guns, have a lot of food and medicine... you open the door and an army of hungry and rogue biounits and reactivated organics along with War Walkers and All-Terrain Heavy laser Squidbots charge your position and - if you're lucky - you made it out alive, you find all you have is a few bullets in your heavy rifle - THAT'S when the game begins, and the game is great at doing that.\n\nYou have to scavenge, conserve every bullet (I mean it, once you've played it you'll understand after a few dozens of stupid deaths) and constantly be on your guard. Doesn't matter if you're armed to the teeth, you can get screwed by a single encounter.\n\nPros (keeping in mind the genre of the game, same applies to the cons):\n- Hard difficulty but it's fair and the game teaches you everything you need to know in the tutorial and during the gameplay itself.\n\n- Simple yet effective graphic design. Some people might say it looks like crap but I think it looks good, especially when considering the dynamic shadows and the way game renders the walls and light sources.\n\n- Good sound design, it's nothing outstanding but considering it's indie and so and that some of the sounds were sourced from different websites I think it works well, and the sound IS important in this game so keep that in mind.\n\n- Cool level design, it reminds me of games like DOOM or Quake but in 2D, heh.\n\nCons:\n- Enemies. There's nothing wrong about them, really... It's just that you're basically fighting zombies all the way through the game, wish the enemies were a bit more creative. They still have different ranged attacks so at least there's that.\n\n- No way to save middle of the game, no matter what. You unlock save points by beating levels, so let's say you get to level 5 and the game unlocks the start from level 3 for you. Sadly, if you leave middle of the game - tough ♥♥♥♥ - you have to start all over again if you want to play again or use one of the unlockable save points. This really, really sucks in this game because it's God damn hard, so let's say you play for 5 hours, have to leave and close the game - boom, gone. No way to continue from that point :(\n\n- Stupid DLC which doesn't even include the soundtrack into the game, you have to play it in a music player. I'd advise not to buy it, unless you want the soundtrack for whatever reason (Again, it's not in game if you don't buy it so you have no idea what the soundtrack actually is, lol)\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game.\nHave fun!\n","November 5, 2014","true","16.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

On the surface, it promised me the usual cache of indie-game features: a unique art style, a tried-and-true, marketable gameplay type (roguelikes are all the rage these days) and so on and so on. Imagine, then, my surprise when Teleglitch: Die More Edition turned out to not only be decent, but this year's answer to 2012's fantastic Hotline Miami. Technically, Telegitch was a 2012 release, but this shiny new version adds a host of features that personally, I don't think the game could really live without.\n\nWe play as some space marine doing what space marines do best: answering distress calls and blowing things of varying size into as many pixel-y bits as possible. We learn, slowly, that some wacky experiments were going on with teleportation and mutation and blah blah blah, you've heard it before. The story is bland, but well-told through audio logs that mark the first time I've actually stopped to read the darn things. A dark sense of humor certainly helps.\n\nGameplay is really why we're here though. Teleglitch, as I hinted in a rather blatant manner at, reminds me of last year's incredible Hotline Miami. Mutants don't approach; they charge head-on. Hostiles with guns shoot without stopping to check if perhaps you're friendly after all. Dodge their bullets, and they begin leading their aim. There is very good reason the subtitle of this game implies we're going to die. More.\n\nNone of this is a bad thing. This is a challenging game, one I may never see the final level of, but it is so without being unfair. The controls are responsive, your aim is reasonably accurate, and if you're conservative with bullets the first few stages, ammo's never a problem. Nope, every death here is you screwing up, as every death should be. The levels are just randomized enough to keep things interesting, but not so much you run the risk of being unable to defend yourself. You have the tools you need, it's all down to how you apply them.\n\nVisually, Teleglitch is kind of surprising. Screenshots would have you believe this could have come out alongside Doom as a cheap pack-in. In motion, however, this game looks fantastic. It packs a retro feel, sure, but it's overlayed with effects as you explode and shoot and otherwise murder things that warp the pixels around you. This is probably the first time I can actually say post-processing effects really add something to a game, but here they really do. Each bomb and bullet looks as though it's tearing the world apart.\n\nIndeed, Teleglitch: DME puts me in the difficult position of having to admit I can't really think of many faults with something. It falls under the umbrella of that rare caste of games with perfect difficulty, meaningful visual design, and just plain visceral fun. Teleglitch may have run me just over $2 at the time I purchased it, but I think, of all the titles I've given a go this year, it just might be the one I'll keep installed.","December 14, 2013","true","4.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Essentially what you'd get if you put the real-time shooting back into Doom: The Roguelike. Ten randomly generated floors of sci-fi research complex, and a hojillion monsters, zombies, mutants and robots between you and escape. It's very hard, and it's very good, and kinda terrifying until you get a feel for it.\n\nIt's a game of resource management, really. You're always low on ammo, enemies are dangerous, healing is scarce and as you get deeper into the complex, enemies become more resistant to low-caliber firearms, meaning you either have to scavenge carefully or use a basic crafting system to bodge together custom weapons.\n\nThe art style can be pretty divisive - it's a concious decision to make things as minimalist as possible while still being visually parseable. Whether it achieves that goal is a point of much debate, but I've never had much trouble with it. The excellent audio (everything has its own audio cue) helps cut through the noise, too.\n\nThe Die More edition is a general tweaking, tuning and polishing update. There's a few new weapon types, and five of the levels have alternate exits that lead to 'B-side' version of the next level, giving it a little more replay value.\n\nTotally worth it, especially as it's on sale right now.","October 7, 2013","true","2.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Because if you don't, you'll get sick of it fast.  Environments vary little for the first half of the game, and you're going to be stuck there for a while.  I still haven't beaten it, but I like Teleglitch.  I just wish there was more than one kind of environment.\n\nGameplay is frenetic, intense, slow, and crazy in intervals.  The action has a kind of lethal tempo that it's visual style helps accentuate elegantly.  Audio is minimalistic, effective at evoking atmosphere, and occasionally frightening.\n\nThe game does want to eat you.  Those interested should give it a try if they can catch it on sale, but only veterans of the rogue-like genre should consider it at full price.  /Opinion\n\nBottom Line:  I'm personally giving this game a full recommendation.    If you've like what I and others have to say about it, get it.","December 20, 2014","true","75.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Some of the negative reviews would make you think that this game will kill your family or something, so I was skeptical, but it's just a regular a-hole style roguelike. You're going to die a lot and a good deal of the time there's nothing you can do about it. It's not fair, but it's not supposed to be.

A lot. No seriousley, I have put in over 20 hours into this game and I still haven't gotten to level 6 yet. (it's those goddam war walkers in level 5 that always kill me!) (Edit: After 36 hours I've gotten to level 7 twice. Was insta killed by a squid 10/10)calling this game hard is an understatement. It's like if you took that one "impossible game" flash thing that was popular on the internet BUT ADDED GUNS!!!! Well not really... If you want to know how hard it is, it might have been updated but last time I checked 1.2 % of all teleglitch players have actually beaten the game. Give those guys an award!\n\nanyways, lets break the game down!\n\nLEVEL DESIGN: if i had to rate the level design id rate it a 7/10. It's the same rooms with the same chests but in a diffrent order and diffrent item placing. Notice the word placing. On level 1 you will always find (if you explore everything) 2 medkits that will revive 50 % of your health, a shotgun, a sticky grenade launcher, a bunch of canned meat, and MMMMM BOMBS (cdi refrence). Some people find this repetative but in my opinion, if the game was really, REALLY randomly generated with diffrent items and new rooms, IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE! Knowing what items I get is a huge advantage! I guess what I'm saying is I dont care if people say it's repetative, I LOVE IT.\nwhen and if you beat level 1 (around 38 % actually do, but it's not that hard in my opinion. I beat level 1 on my first try!) you will come across 2 teleporters. One goes to a path that has an easier level with poopy items and then a BALLS TO THE WALLS HARD ONE proceeding to level 5. The other is just two really hard levels but with better items proceeding to level 5. Choices are good right? I personally love this gimmick as it affects my run depending on which I chose... Except now I dont choose because I know which I like.\n\nSOUND AND MUSIC music!: there is none.\none of the cons to this game is there is no music. If the game had good music it would make the game waaaay more stressful. Running down a hallway into an open room wen suddenly: AHHHHHHHH A SQUIIIIIID!!!!!!! Just kidding! Ive never seen a squid in my entire 20 hours. Edit: After 30 hours I finally found a squid and killed it. Yay! Double Edit: The DLC adds music that isn't working... Yet. I've heard the devs are working on it.\nThe sound effects are pretty good. The gun noises sound pretty realistic, and the noises the mutants make is pretty creepy.\n\nVISUALS i know totalbiscut mentions this in his review, but the graphics have improved since he played it. DO NOT LET HIS REVIEW TURN YOU AWAY! Shading is better with shadows looking more "real" and in DME the menu is waaaaaaaay better. Something totalbiscut did say that is still true are how the guns feel. They feel like you're firing bullets instead of just a point in front of you that damages your enemies like in some FPS games. But what's even better are the bombs. When i first played the game I did with headphones. I threw a bomb and when it exploded I BLINKED! And I blinked the next 20 bombs or so as well! The explosion combined with the sound made me feel like something might hit my eye SO I BLINKED! I love the bombs in this game, they're even cooler than the guns.\n\nGAMEPLAY/CONTROLS you move with WASD but can change it, you shoot by holding right click then left clicking. Why? Well if you just normally left click you use a knife. Its pretty clever. Gameplay consists of running around, fighting monsters, exploring, and beng rewarded for exploring with items... Or monsters. It has a risk/reward system that keeps you on edge and when you find something good makes you be like "sweet!" You repeat this until you find a teleporter or die. Wait, this sound a ot like binding of issac now that i think about it...\n\nOTHER THINGS I FORGOT TO SAY THAT ARE GOOD heres a list\n\ncrafting- there are so many options you have to make decisions whether to make this or that.\n\nitems/weapons- huge diversity. Theres like 100 or so diffrent items total and all are useful.\n\nmonsters- same as items but not useful. very, VERY not useful. Also theres only like 20 but its still awesome.\n\nstory- not the main focus of the game, but you find little bunches of info here and there to piece together and find out what happened. Really good.\n\nglitches- only came across one glitch but it made me rage so hard! I was about to get to level 5 for the first time and i got stuck at a text box. Edit: Happened to me again twice: Once in the tutorial while teaching a friend how to play and once on level 6 when I was about to get to level 7 for the first time >:c\n\nOVERALL this game is really fun. 9/10","January 21, 2015","true","45.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

But it become repetetive only after 10 or 15 minutes. There is lot I do NOT like about this game:\n- when you die, there is nothing you bring from "previous life" (this is permadeath rogelike) - there is no upgrades or development of you character\n- graphics is not so well - all the screens look the same - I managed to get only to level 4 and it was all the same - retro style is nice, but it's repetetive after few screens\n- everything is very random - in one run a have more than 150 bullets, in second run I get no more than 20 (I known that rogelike is based on randomness, but it doesn't mean, that your run is unplayable becasuse of the lack of ammo)\n- I died at least twice in a way I cannot control/affect - bunch of enemies just run at me, when I was in narrow corridor and there was nothing I can do (look at the following bullet)\n- changing of wapon is pain - weapon is just another item in your inventory, so when you want to heal yourself - move 4 item down with mousewheel, use medkit, and then 4 items back (maybe there are some shortcusts but I didnt look - you can move items in your inventory but it do not help much)\n- gameplay is boring - you are walking in empty complex and from time to time some "monster" with poor AI runs towards you. Most of the time you are runing backwards trying to kill it with knife just to save bullets because you never known how much you find in this instance\n\nthis game would be great if they use the atmosphere, environment and story to more RPGish/adventurish style...\n\nAfter 2 hour session I return back to store page, hoping that this game is selling for 3-5€... 12,99€??? Really??? Hope that I get it from humble bundle or at least in 90% sale...\n\nyou get perfect picture about this game from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2-ZO94ZXpM in 10 minutes you will see everything - if you can look at it more than 10 minutes, maybe it's good game for you (-:","June 23, 2015","false","2.2"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

Its storyline and little facts about the game were boring and hard to read in the pixelated text it uses. having to complete 5 levels before being able to save the game is just lame and ruins the whole fun of the game, overall I felt this game didnt offer enough to make me want to keep playing over the same maps versing the same units, getting up to level 4 and spawning next to a room filled with the strongest enemies who immediatly swarm you and murder you making you have to go back to level 1 and work your way through a pixelated nightmare of repetition. 2/10","March 1","false","2.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

In this game you can use your fists, a gun, or even bombs (if you find them). If you kill the creatures you do have the possibility to get canned meat which increases your health and also a better chance at surviving the section. The goal of this game is to survive the section without dieing, if you die you have to restart section you are on. But after completing the all the sections within that level you can do other levels that you can do. The best thing about this game is that it supports a controller because lets face it... the controls on a keyboard are pretty horrible in the game.

The name says: Die More. Well, you won't die more, you will die MUCH more. I had 130 hours in Dark Souls and as many in Dark Souls 2, but both game were EASY compared to the stress level this one gives. You may never know what is behind a corner. Problem is, you will never respawn nor have a save to repeat that place. In fact, the levels are random. If in Dark Souls you would know the level by memory after some deaths, here you just experience a new level every time you die. And you die a lot. There are some 'checkpoints' meaning that if you reach a certain level (there are 10 levels) you have the possibility to start from 2 levels before (e.g. reach level 5? you can then start from the 3rd without having to start all over from the first). That sounds easy, but I was literally not able to reach level 7 (and thus be able to start from level 5).\n\n6 Hours in this game is not a lot at all. I guess to really be able to complete the game you have to spend much more. And die much more than I did. I liked the game a lot, but it simply needs a concentration and patience I do not have in these days. I have lots of games to play, and not so much free time so I'll have to pass on this demanding and almost stressful title. Maybe I will play it again in the future. In the meantime, I can only recommend this particular game, I cannot compare it to anything else, it reminded me a bit of the difficulties encountered in the Dark souls games, but it still is VERY different obviously. 85/100 would be my rating, despite having played it not that long. It is surely a nice little gem. Have fun with it (or have none, lol).","December 17, 2014","true","7.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The name says: Die More. Well, you won't die more, you will die MUCH more. I had 130 hours in Dark Souls and as many in Dark Souls 2, but both game were EASY compared to the stress level this one gives. You may never know what is behind a corner. Problem is, you will never respawn nor have a save to repeat that place. In fact, the levels are random. If in Dark Souls you would know the level by memory after some deaths, here you just experience a new level every time you die. And you die a lot. There are some 'checkpoints' meaning that if you reach a certain level (there are 10 levels) you have the possibility to start from 2 levels before (e.g. reach level 5? you can then start from the 3rd without having to start all over from the first). That sounds easy, but I was literally not able to reach level 7 (and thus be able to start from level 5).\n\n6 Hours in this game is not a lot at all. I guess to really be able to complete the game you have to spend much more. And die much more than I did. I liked the game a lot, but it simply needs a concentration and patience I do not have in these days. I have lots of games to play, and not so much free time so I'll have to pass on this demanding and almost stressful title. Maybe I will play it again in the future. In the meantime, I can only recommend this particular game, I cannot compare it to anything else, it reminded me a bit of the difficulties encountered in the Dark souls games, but it still is VERY different obviously. 85/100 would be my rating, despite having played it not that long. It is surely a nice little gem. Have fun with it (or have none, lol).","December 17, 2014","true","7.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But it is difficult to a point where it becomes pure torture to play it.\n\nI love these top down shooters, and I don't mind that games are hard.\nBut this one is just plain stupidly difficult.\n\nI could probably live with the fact that there is no save option, and that death is permanent if it was only per level. But the game requires you to get to level 5, to be able to start from level 3.\nThis takes something like at least half an hour. No matter how good a game is, I don't like to spend that amount of time, just to make a little mistake, and then having to restart.\n\nSome people will tell you that it's the purpose of the game to be that difficult. But gameplay wise there is no logic to that. Beating this game could give you bragging rights, but really it's as stupid as bragging about "Wow guys! Yesterday I finally managed to roll a dice and get a six , ten times in a row... cool eh?"\n\n\nThe game actually tells a funny story and has some interesting stuff going on. But most players will never get past level 3... so most of it is lost.\n\nIt's a d**n shame that the developers decided: "F**k it... I don't want to create more content. Instead I'll just ramp up the difficulty so it takes weeks to beat the game anyway."\n\n\nThe truth is that most people will feel cheated if they pay for this game... so I can not recommend it.\n","November 8, 2014","false","1.8"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

I really like the top-down gameplay and the atmosphere of the game (reminds me of a 2D version of Dead Space), but I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth due to the extreme difficulty. Can there be a Die Less Edition?? The player is quickly swarmed with very fast moving enemies, and the player has very limited resources which creates tons of deaths. I was able to complete Level 1 but upon dying on Level 2 numerous of times I'm always forced to restart at the beginning of Level 1! I need to reach Level 5 in order to unlock and start at Level 3; looking at the Steam Achievements only ~20% of the game owners have even beat Level 2 which just shows the absurd difficulty the game puts players through. I wish there was an option to make the game more "casual" for those who just want to enjoy the story/atmosphere and not go through a tedious grind of replaying the levels over and over just to progress a small amount before having to repeat.","April 1","false","1.6"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","6"

It starts off as a Survival/Horror esq theme and if you played the tutorial you might be confident enough to waltz out the front door. However after about 10 minutes of creeping around rooms and halls like a scared child I began to realize the AI for the "Mutants" and "Zombies" was really strange. Instead of charging you directly or hiding in ambush they sort of ran -past- you and orbitted you. Originally I thought it was just loose controls and they would slide past me but after I got comfortable with the enemies they just kinda run around and run into walls etc. The AI is stupid and way too 4th wall breaking, it seems like they're designed to orbit you to make shooting them harder which attributes to difficulty, but it also ruins the story for me atleast. I can't focus on the story and surviving when the AI knows it's a game and I'm the player. Not to mention all the overly loud Whirring noises and buzzing sounds caused by random map elements "Immersive" but irritating and overshadow the rest of the sounds. Glad I bought this on sale and hope I can refund it. Other than that though, the bullet hitboxes feel off or sloppy, ammo feels a little too abundant and all the enemies have active hitboxes rather than clawing/biting or punching/kicking at you they just touch you, poor design imo.\n\n\nTL;DR\n1. Enemies orbit you because they know you're the player. (Artificial Difficulty)\n2. Didn't enjoy the loud whirring noises overshadowing things.\n3. Over Abundance of ammo and enemies seemed a little too healthy.\n4. Nice story but hard to get immersed in the enviroment.\n\n\nI got this on sale and I'm not particularly pleased about it.\n\n\n*Disclaimer*\nThe core mechanics are nice aiming is superb feels realistic (Bullet hitboxes feel weird) and I like the idea of the story but the gameplay really didn't cut it for me, and I'm not refunding it because it's unplayable but merely because I would rather not play it.","June 21, 2015","false","1.4"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","6"

I just died on level 4 because I went into a room and two big zombies and three little ones were right against the door and two shooters were in the room and I had 75 health and no kits and died in about 2 seconds. And that is considering that it takes a incredible amount of luck to get to level 5 so you can permanently unlock the ability to start the game from level 3. Which is a bad idea anyway because when you start from a higher level at a later date, you keep none of your supplies. So basically, you absolutely have to do this game in one run. What makes the game so bad are a few things. First is that they expect you to navigate a list of ten or more items in the game while backpedaling from enemy swarms. It is very difficult because of the unnecessarily large variety of guns and bombs and food. It could have been somewhat easier had there simply been a few less different items to navigate. You can drop nailbombs and what not to blow up a pack of zombies while you run away, but you have to be extremely careful or it kills you too. Normally this all would be great, but the real game killer in my opinion are two things. One is hitboxes. They are very tiny. To shoot an enemy with your pistol you have to hit it directly in the head twice to kill. A body shot and your bullets pass through it without damaging it. I frequently find myself taking more than 2 shots to kill something and wasting my ultra scarce ammo because of the biggest flaw in the game which is the only real reason that it is so extremely difficult: enemy sliding and circle-stepping around you. I have seen it in many other games in my lifetime and I am not sure why developers do it. It is when an enemy gets close to you and melee attacks you but you can't land any shots or melee hits of your own because it magically circle floats around you while hitting you, draining tons of your life. This one is doubly upsetting because enemies also walk towards you in a slightly wobbly pattern, which combined with their very small one millimeter hitboxes, make it unbelievably frustrating.\n\nThe only thing I liked about this game were the graphics. They are vomit inducing blurry Atari 2600 graphics to most, but I found that it works alright for this particular game. Considering that it is a cheap game, I am perfectly happy just forgetting about it and playing one of the other 140+ great games that I have installed right now. I do not have to have anything else to do with this game to prove my gaming skills. I have beat some of the hardest games of all-time because they did not have poor hitboxing and float circling from enemies, two hallmarks of a poorly made game.\n\nThis game is a rare example of one that does not deserve the high praise that it got from some reviewers, but amazingly somehow ppl like it. I don't get it because I have had an easier time beating harder but much better programmed games.","November 16, 2014","false","7.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Stay far away, unless you got your copy handed to you for free like I did. In which case I still don't recommend it. Going to AFK for the cards, throw them up in the store, and uninstall. I'm not even going to bother reviewing this thing. Boot this sh()t up and see for yourself. There are many decent looking Indie/flash games you could have been playing instead of going blind trying to play this. It only has 1 resolution btw, which is a painfully tiny box, all the more reason it should have been in your browser window where it could have fit perfectly fine, instead of sitting in the corner of a huge monitor where at least 75% of your screen is unused. They obviously ported it for $$$ they don't deserve. It's only slightly bigger than videos on Youtube or other sites, with no way to increase it like videos usually have.(Many videos even do 1080p at this point)\n\nThis is about as much as I expect from Paradox now days, and I knew I'd be here condemning the game as soon as I saw their name on it before I even started.

First off , I want to say that my review is based on the demo.Why? Because the developer needs 1 year just to fix the bug that doesnt let me to play the latest version.\n\nI am really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off because of this.I waited: one week , two , three.Now the new update came out ( 9.3 ) and I was hyped because I thought the problem was fixed.Guess what? It was not. The developer added tons of new stuff but left the people with problems behind.Now I want to quote what I think he would say: "They gave me the money and they cant request a refund because steam wont let them.Now let's add more stuff and a DLC just to make a little bit more money."\n\nNow back to the review:\n\nThe game looks like a 90's game.I like 90's games and I bought it.But it did not want to start so I tried the demo version.I played the game like 1 hour since the demo version wont let you get past level 2 or 3 ( I don't remember exactly ). Well the game is hard.REALLY HARD. It took me that hole hour I played just to get past level 1.You will find weapons or materials which you can craft weapons with or bombs.You will find bigger monsters which are harder to kill.Basically if you love a 90's survival game type thingy you should buy it.\n\nJust remember: IF THIS LOOKS LIKE A 90'S PC IT DOESNT MEAN YOU CAN RUN IT WITH A PC THAT HAS 14 YEARS. Mine has like 5 years and I can't run it because of that bug.It seems that you need a PC that can run crysis 2 or 3 first.\n\nConclusion: If you want a game to stay in your library it's worth the money.You won't play the game more than 2 hours then you will leave it there.If it doesnt start... well you will play the demo version and wait 1 year or 2 for the developer to fix the problem.","May 21, 2014","false","1.7"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

I honestly have no idea when and how I got this game (probably as a download code at PAX Prime last year), but it's been sitting in my library for a really long time and I thought I may as well try it out.\n\nI don't think I'll be touching this game a whole lot anymore.\n\nFirst of all, the controlls are terrible when you're using a keyboard and touch pad. Unlike the demographic this game was probably aimed for, I lack any kind of controllers compatible with Steam or even a mouse (laptop player here), so the game is really awkward and clunky as a result; which strongly contrasts with the "intense, fast, Dark Souls hard" gameplay. Navigating the menu is a disaster, shooting and aiming a gun is a nightmare, and melee attacks will usually leave you aimlessly punching while your health slowly depleats.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the camera moves like a drunk version of The Sims. It has a top down perspective and the camera moves with you as you move, but it swerves around and never stays in a fixed location and will black out areas from your sight depending on where you are. I can only imagine that this will greatly increase the difficulty of the game later on.\n\nOn top of all that, the game just feels dead. The graphics, while intentionally undetailed, make it difficult to distinguish things from one another, so there isn't a strong vision of what's going on. Not to mention that there's no music at all. You could say that this is done to create a feeling of isolation and helplessness ala Metroid, but even that game from 1986 was able to drive home those feelings mainly becasue of it's music.\n\nIf there's one good thing I can say about this game it's that it only has five total trading cards, meaning that you can level it up pretty quickly, but if you feel like you may have the same opinion as me, then look for other games that can help you achieve that with the bonus of being fun. Like I said in the begining, just because I don't like it doesn't necessarily mean that you won't, but I just couldn't get into it.\n\n4/10","May 20","false","2.0"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","1"

The procedurally generated world isn't that diverse.  After 20 minutes, I noticed the same layout's from a game a few minutes prior.  I understand rogue likes are supposed to be hard, but this one just isn't that fun to play.  I was initially using a gamepad then switched to kb&m and found the latter works MUCH better.  You need the sensitivity of a mouse for aiming.\n\nThe developers tried to go with a Doom like vibe with this top down shooter.  I felt like I was playing Doom 3 but in a retro, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ parody of it.  You will go through so many doors and hallways that look the same.  The shooting is the most demanding thing from this game.  You have to learn how to stay ahead of your target or you will miss most of the time.  Ammo is also extremely scarse on some playthrough's making your fists the weapon of choice in the first level to conserve ammo.\n\nUltimately, it's a repeptive rogue like shooter that doesn't hold my attention for more than an hour at a time.  It's good if you want to waste 20 minutes before you go to work.  If there were some character development or upgrades you could do in between deaths, it would add longevity to the very repetitive gameplay.  Luckily, I got this game for just over $1.  When I saw that this game was 13 bucks I LOL'd.","October 17, 2015","false","4.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Failure will be punished with permadeath. The controller-support doesn't deliver, and unfortunately Teleglitch is not build to be an arcade-ish twinstick-shooter and kind of resembles "Dead Nation" in it's approach to aiming/shooting. If I had to compare the "gamefeel" of shooting and aiming to something I would say it's a top-down Counterstrike, clad in a DooM-like setting (no blasphemous hellspawn around though) with rather unnecessary crafting/survival-horror thrown in for good measure. A mix that might be appealing to some, but certainly isn't for me.\n\nI did however enjoy reading the various text-files and logs - the lore and setting works just fine. And the general art-direction is very cool, with added scanlines this game is quite nicely looking despite the somewhat 8-Bit style used and a lot of subtle visual effects add a nice touch to these big chunky pixels. It's just a shame the rest isn't as convincing - might be a case of wrong expectations on my part, but this game is lacking the "arcade-style" quality that I am looking for in top-down games.","November 22, 2013","false","2.5"," 13 of 30 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","13","30","0","0"

The point of a "retro throwback" is to take the good parts of a game and keep them intact, while improving on the parts that were lacking.

My recommendation is to avoid it even at the 75% discount cost, which feels about full price for something like this(Hint: This is a 0.99$ game you get in a bundle).\n\nThis game is Hack, Slash, Loot under a different coat of paint so if you did for some reason love HSL then by all means pick this one up. For those who don't know what HSL is, It's a rogue-like, but without any of the tricks and strategy that goes into beating other rogue-likes. In other rogue-likes you might die because you got careless, forgot something or just didn't know any better, but H,S,L will kill you just because F@#% You, it's a terrible game that can be summed up with just a few words, unfun RNG ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nBack to this game. There is no playing smart, no strategizing with this one, you either have a gun with ammo or you don't because you couldn't find one, but too bad about not finding one because the mobs running at you don't care. The only way to progress though this game is to bash your head against a brick wall over and over again until the RNG smiles down upon you and you some how managed to make it past the level 1-5 floors you kept dying on and you got past level 5, which now lets you start at level 3, repeat head bashing over and over again for floors 3-7 until the RNG smiles on you and you somehow manage to beat level 7 which will let you start a new game at level 5 this time, repeat once again for floors 5-9 and 7-10 until you can finally beat level 10 and finish this POS.\n\nIt also auto deletes saves because it's a rogue-like and we can't allow save scumming in a single player game, which is fine I guess but unfortunately the game has crashed on me twice now after beating a level which has deleted my save, so you might also want to consider holding off until some bug fixing patches first.\n\nIt's an incredibly shallow rogue-like, and after an hour of play you'll feel like you've basically seen everything the game has to offer save some special bosses. At 3.25$ (never mind the laughable 12.99 regular price, holy ♥♥♥♥ what were they thinking) it's just to much to ask for, for this copy/paste floor design for 10 levels game that adds a ton of aggravating ♥♥♥♥ to it that makes it overall unfun to play, just like with H,S,L.\n\nBuy a good cup of coffee instead.","October 8, 2013","false","9.0"," 12 of 30 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","12","30","0","1"

I love the way it looks and I enjoy the actual gameplay.  I thrive on difficulty and challenge.  This game, however, is not falsely advertising.  You will die more.  The game will literally never give you what you need to survive more than 2 or three levels.  Maybe I'm just getting too old for this, but the amount of dying I was doing without gaining any skills was too frusterating.  Which would be okay, but it's really not fun to die on level one 50 times in a row and not be given the tools to survive.\n\nI'm not saying it's a bad game.  But it's sure not for me.  I wish I could give my copy away so maybe someone else can enjoy it, because I don't even want to own this game anymore.\n\n[EDIT]\nAfter the new rebalancing patch I have to change my tune.  This game now has a more appropriate difficulty curve that is both challenging, and encourages improvment and continued gameplay by letting you get past the first couple levels with less death-swarms, and more resources.\n\nI'd like to thank the developers for making me feel like I spent money on a game I can now enjoy much more consitently.","January 11, 2014","true","19.8"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

The entire production feels like a student project more than anything.  I'm sorry, but a decent student project doesn't make for a good commerical game.\n\nTeleglitch is a clunky twin stick shooter with the pretensions of a roguelike. The worst parts of being a roguelike,with the uneven difficulty making it boring until  the seconds before you die and you have to repeat, and repeat, and repeat.  The basic shooting/combat mechanic is passable but movement through the levels is a chore since you have no idea what the hell you are looking at. There seems to be some kind of deep meta game with a cool variety of weapons, items, and enemies.  It's too bad it all ends up being pointless window dressing because the basic gameplay loop is so unsatisfying.\n\nGraphics wise the enemies are very generic retro pixel art, and there is not much you can do wrong or right with a single pixel for each limb.  It is not an exaggeration to say that Robotron in 1982 had more detailed characters.  The shadows swinging around to show line of sight are obnoxious and distracting.\n\nThe backgrounds and levels however are godawful.  The color palletes and mystery blobs make each level a modern art puzzle smeared over a low resolution pixel canvas.  Is that a door, a table, a wall, a gun, a plant, a light, a rug, a dead body, a crate, or a brown lump?  Can I interact with it or move through it? The graphics certainly won't tell you, so you will have to memorize it through one of your 50 plays through the same area.  A more elegant minimalist approach to the backgrounds would have suited this kind of game much better.","November 1, 2014","false","2.3"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","1"

Most people won't even get past level 3, so that "checkpoint" is worthless, again because people won't even make it to level 4 (and 5 to actually trigger the checkpoint)\n\nThere's no "easy" mode, so you have no opportunity to practice to learn how to fight the hard enemies.

Some games are really bad, but they have personality, a vibe about them you can describe and assign. A REASON for being bad. this game is like a black hole. I don't know why its so bad, maybe it's the frustrating combat system, bland story, even more bland art style and boring audio... Or the fact that no matter how far you progress, if you die, its game over. Which although I understand the total restart feature isn't really an absolute bad thing, it's very frustrating. The levels are long and difficult, so why not give the player a checkpoint of some sorts SOMEWHERE in the game.\n\nMaybe I'm just not the type of person that understands what this game is really trying to offer to me, but I can tell you it wasn't worth the money for me.

The monsters are fast and tricky and aiming it quite a challenge at first, but you'll pick up on it. There is a simple game toggle to allow for random gear on start, which can help, or in some cases leave you with no weapon, only a cool piece of gear and a bomb to start; making the challenge all the greater!

Some like challenging games, others just want mindless FPS games, some like puzzle games, etc.\nThis I simply don't.\n\nBut I'm not saying it's a bad game, quite the opposite , this is just my opinion of it, and I wouldn't recommend it because of it.\n\nI have a friends review of it and here it is :\n\n'Jesus Object Christ, this game is amazing.\n\nI'm sorry. I can play this game hours, and hours, and hours on end. Teleglitch refines the "careful planning" of a roguelike with the intense fast-paced adrenaline rush that Hotline Miami delivered. It also provided me with a couple jump scares and the overall atmosphere is very intensified.\n\nThe gear-like teleglitch patterns are actually scary; they instantly kill you, make a deep and spooky sound and block ways you'd normally be able to go. Unlike some other walls in the game they feel like things completely not supposed to be there. There was a difference between a corridor that ended with a cave-in and a corridor that ended with a teleglitch blocking the way.\n\nThe difficulty curve is ridiculous and unpredictable in the right direction. The game slowly eases from mutants to zombies, then introduces guards at the same time. Suddenly, if not prepared, the few bosses encountered can catch you off guard and force you to use your powerful weapons you planned to save for further on.\n\nOne thing, finally, that has to be noted, is the ammo conservation part. Ammo is very, very scarce early on, and forces the player to use every weapon even when they believe it's the wrong time to do so. I've used rocket launchers on tiny mutants and been forced to use my last 9mm bullets to take down the Big Bad coming my way.\n\nThis game needs more attention on all fronts.'\n\nHe loves it, I don't, simple as that.","January 5, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Sound design also adds to the old-school feeling with it's pixelated beeps and bleeps. Not to mention, adds to the creepy factor of the game.\n\n-Well thought-out and interesting story and lore content.  You could think of it sort of being like Half-life with a much darker tone and takes a few cues from Doom.\n\n-levels are open, big and change layout per play through. You will never see the same route twice.\n\n-You always feel encouraged to explore for loot and lore in a level even if the exit is nearby.\n\n-Gameplay is simple top-down point and shooting action mixed with  survival-horror elements. But that doesn't mean the game is a breeze to play through. The crafting is to the point and easy to use, you won't have to look up a wiki article to find an item recipe.\n\n-Enemy AI can pose a challenge. They aren't some mindless targets that simply jump out and run towards you awaiting to be gunned down. They will actually try to dodge your shots and move on your blindspots to attack.\n\n\nCons: (Though you could argue this is more of a personal annoyance than flaws.)\n\n-While the game's difficulty is refreshing and will keep you on your toes, it can have it's fair share of annoyances.  Like the checkpoint system. This game is very strict in marking your level progress, it will only make a checkpoint after you complete a bulk of the levels at a time.\n\nBut because of the steep difficulty curve in the gameplay, death is inenvitable. You're going to die sooner or later. And when you do, unless you unlocked a checkpoint recently, you go back to the last one you unlocked which was WAY back in the levels.  Some cases even going back to the start of the game.\n\nThis gets extremely aggravating when you have to play level one three times just because you died on level four and have to play the same levels over and over again to get back where you left off. However on the other hand, the game would probably lose some difficulty if there was a more forgiving checkpoint system. So I guess it's more about having patence with the game.\n\nOverall, Teleglitch is a well-made shooter that accomplished what it set out to do. It doesn't do anything ground-breaking but goes on what it knows best. It's fun, challenging, and quite lengthy with annoyances such as a checkpoint system that is a little too strict for my taste.  But to each his own.\n\n\n\n","December 16, 2014","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sound design also adds to the old-school feeling with it's pixelated beeps and bleeps. Not to mention, adds to the creepy factor of the game.\n\n-Well thought-out and interesting story and lore content.  You could think of it sort of being like Half-life with a much darker tone and takes a few cues from Doom.\n\n-levels are open, big and change layout per play through. You will never see the same route twice.\n\n-You always feel encouraged to explore for loot and lore in a level even if the exit is nearby.\n\n-Gameplay is simple top-down point and shooting action mixed with  survival-horror elements. But that doesn't mean the game is a breeze to play through. The crafting is to the point and easy to use, you won't have to look up a wiki article to find an item recipe.\n\n-Enemy AI can pose a challenge. They aren't some mindless targets that simply jump out and run towards you awaiting to be gunned down. They will actually try to dodge your shots and move on your blindspots to attack.\n\n\nCons: (Though you could argue this is more of a personal annoyance than flaws.)\n\n-While the game's difficulty is refreshing and will keep you on your toes, it can have it's fair share of annoyances.  Like the checkpoint system. This game is very strict in marking your level progress, it will only make a checkpoint after you complete a bulk of the levels at a time.\n\nBut because of the steep difficulty curve in the gameplay, death is inenvitable. You're going to die sooner or later. And when you do, unless you unlocked a checkpoint recently, you go back to the last one you unlocked which was WAY back in the levels.  Some cases even going back to the start of the game.\n\nThis gets extremely aggravating when you have to play level one three times just because you died on level four and have to play the same levels over and over again to get back where you left off. However on the other hand, the game would probably lose some difficulty if there was a more forgiving checkpoint system. So I guess it's more about having patence with the game.\n\nOverall, Teleglitch is a well-made shooter that accomplished what it set out to do. It doesn't do anything ground-breaking but goes on what it knows best. It's fun, challenging, and quite lengthy with annoyances such as a checkpoint system that is a little too strict for my taste.  But to each his own.\n\n\n\n","December 16, 2014","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A departure from the typical turn based roguelikes (which I do enjoy), there's an additional element of action, forcing you to act without having any time to plan your actions.\n\nThe story is pretty typical with an experiment gone wrong, with the facility gone to hell. Aside from the monologue between levels, terminals are scattered through the randomly generated areas, with small bits and pieces to inform you of the various devices in the game, as well as things you can do to make your life more manageable.\n\nGraphically, this game does well. Without attempting to try and make the graphics realistic, the pixel style is a nice step up from the grid-based tile setup, and the lighting flickers to just show the outline of the enemies ahead.\n\nThe sounds are minimalistic, and the eery silence will make you strain to listen out for any of the encounters that could be lurking in the shadows. Weapons sound the way you'd imagine, although they are a vast contrast to when you're not in combat.\n\nGameplay in Teleglitch is challenging and unforgiving, layering pressure with every level as you struggle to manage materials, deal with the enemies, and escape from the current sector.\n\nParadox recently released a new patch which added an arena mode which allows you to get into the action much quicker. With different loadouts, you can take on multitudes of enemies with items you probably didn't know existed. It however can get repetitive as the required objectives are fairly standard and tend to loop over and over. They are also limited by the fact that you can only unlock arenas after reaching a level from the main game.\n\nYou might play this game once, and forget it for a while. But do come back to it. You might escape after all.","July 20, 2014","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combat becomes rote, but combat in any game becomes that way once you play it a few times.\n\nI recommend it if you enjoy rogue-like games.

In other words, it’s a perfect storm of indie game clichés. But it proves that it’s lack of imagination, or flawed execution, that makes a bad game out of those clichés.\n\nI can’t explain exactly why, but Teleglitch perfectly captures the feeling I remember of playing DooM for the first time as a kid in the mid-90s. That is to say, it’s absolutely nothing like the DooM I actually played, and everything like the DooM I remember. To me, that’s the absolute best kind of retro.\n\nThe exact mix of those indie game clichés is part of what allows Teleglitch to deliver that DooM-like experience. Randomly/procedurally-generated rooms keep everything fresh, so you’re always encountering rooms for the first time, with no idea what lurks in the corners. The scarcity of ammo and health means you have to worry about every shot. And the way the enemies accelerate as they get closer to you makes the back-pedaling panic that much more intense. And the walls actually extend upwards toward the camera, creating a really interesting variation on the top-down perspective.\n\nBut the wealth of terrible games using a similar mix of elements suggests there’s more to Teleglitch’s evoking of the first-time DooM experience. I can’t put my finger on exactly what it is, but I like it.\n\nhttp://macrotransactions.wordpress.com/2013/10/09/200-games-200-words-10-teleglitch/","October 5, 2014","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story itself is served to you via text and text only. I have seen thre universes in the game. 1) Doom. Yes, it reminds me of 2D Doom, except for you are not an ultimate badass chainsawing through hordes of deamons without a single drop of sweat. 2) Far Rainbow by Boris and Arakdy Strugatsky (Russian sci-fi authors, creators of Stalker), where the teleportation experiments caused the destruction of the planet they took place on. And finally, 3) Strontium by Jiří Kulhánek, Czech sci-fi author. This is due to failed experiments on dead people and the Luxor part in the book. Thanks to this I'm really enjoying the game, besides the game mechanics and pixelated graphics (yes, I actually like these too).\n\nDo I recommend Teleglitch: Die More Edition? Well, yes, I do, thanks for asking. If you don't mind reading, have a decent bit of imagination and feel like being a bit nostalgic time to time, go for it.

Sure, you can count the number of pixels your character is made up of, but the simple, low-res style is compensated for by great lighting effects and clever use of line-of-sight, as well as a sense of nostalgia, mostly of DOS games. With it's top down shooter style reminiscent of Flash games, simple and intuitive controls and inventory and crafting system, the game world itself carries a highly atmospheric setting and a compelling story that you unlock piece by piece at computer terminals ingame. There's a great amount of tension and uncertainty as you shoot, salvage, sort your items and ultimately try to survive, unsure of how long you're going to last.

I have been emotionally and psycologically been pushed further than i ever thought a human being could withstand but despite all I have gone through I know I have to do something. I am not dying here without doing something. I pick myself up off the floor and step past the invisible line that sets off the motion sensor and the door opens; It's time to begin.\n\nI step outside and try to find my bearings but nothing's the same. The Hallways have shifted, the once bustling control center is covered in different Growths. I try to identify some for different sustanence but to no avail; I know what these are, and there's no way I want to be around them much longer. These are part of the experiment sector C was working on, they were trying to biologically modify life forms for military applications, They asked my department to run some tests on these to see exactly what would be the benefits if they infused them with some sort of Mammal. They proved to have poisonous and acidic qualities. As I rememeber all those months ago I feel weak. I put my hand on a nearby table to support myself but it slips and I fall, I look to see what My hand slipped on and I see it's a small handgun. I pick it up and assure myself I won't need it but I take it nonetheless-For security. I tand up and venture down mislplaced hallways until I hear a voice coming from a Room nearby; I can't make out any words but I know I have to see who's there. I once more step past the invisible line to open the door and what I see I couldn't have possibly braced myself for.\n\nThere's a man Infused with the same plant life that I saw in the other room stroking the decaying corpse adonned with the same white coat I myself wore for years in this Facility. Although the creature isn't using his body at all; he's completely in control of the Vines that suspend his body in the air. The shock finally subsides when I realize that he hasn't noticed me yet and I reach for the Gun I Have tucked away in my belt. I reach around, as slow as I possibly can as not to draw attention. I feel my hand wrap around the cold metal, take a deep, silent breath, draw it in front of me and turn off the safety. But as I slide the top part back to chamber the bullet the gun may as well screamed as the click it produced caused the monster to drop the corpse, whip it's half-decayed Face at me and Scream 'DROP IT. DROP IT. DROP IT. DROP IT. DROP IT. DROP IT. DROP IT.' As it was chanting the command I nearly complied out of sheer terror but I stood my ground, Aimed and Fired. It recoiled and Released a scream of Agony right before it Charged at me with speed I'd never seen before, Chanting the same commands as it's old body was being dragged across the floor, leaving a red trail behind it. I shot at it until it stopped moving and my handgun was empty. I stared at the mangled, hole ridden clump of vines, blood, and slime until i was brought back into conciousness by a far too late echo of it's final scream that came from somewhere deeper in the facility. I know they're coming, and I need to prepare.\n\nThis Game is without a doubt, my Favorite Roguelike game I have ever played and it being free on Humble bundle is extremely lucky but I would definitely pay 15 dollars for this game.","November 9, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KoblerMan/recommended/234390/","KoblerMan","KoblerMan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KoblerMan/","258 products in account","So I had been wanting Teleglitch for awhile. It's been in my wishlist for several months, but next to all the other games there, it wasn't really a priority of mine to get it. I thought, "Well, that's a neat little game. Looks like fun." But other than that, I didn't think much more of it.\n\nAnd then PC Gamer posted an article about how the game was free with Humble Bundle. Like, literally free. Not "buy one get one free", but actually free. So it only took me about 3 minutes of juggling with my e-mail, my Steam account and Humble Bundle in Chrome, and BAM! Free game. How awesome is that? (You can get this game for free as well by putting your e-mail address into Humble Bundle's site, and then logging in to Steam and activating the game key. As long as you do it before the end of November 2014.) So that's cool! I got this $13 game for free. Something for nothing. Now for the review!\n\nTeleglitch is reminiscent of other roguelikes available on Steam like FTL and Binding of Isaac. One thing I like about the game is that the lore is actually revealed through walking up to computers in-game and accessing databases, which makes it feel like scanning terminals in Metroid Prime. Sounds are very precise and make you feel like you're actually in a desolate facility, and it feels very immersive. Unlocking lore, killing enemies, and crafting items will help you fill up your Info section which basically gives information and lore on specific aspects of the game. Once you kill an enemy, your info will be updated permanently, and you can view everything in a Risk of Rain monster log style layout.\n\nThe graphics and gameplay make Teleglitch feel kind of like a top-down Doom 3. It has a unique inventory and crafting system as well, and although it took me a little while to figure out how to use it, it actually is really important to craft things in order to survive. For instance, you can combine RDX-250 (an explosive charge) with an empty can of meat that you just ate out of, and a box of nails, to create a one-shot-use weapon called the 'cangun' that explodes and sprays shrapnel in the face of your enemies. Pretty awesome. And there's plenty of other goodies you can craft besides that.\n\nThe combat system feels nice once you get the hang of it. It's fairly simple controls. WASD moves your character, right-click and hold to aim, left-click to shoot, R to reload. Alternatively, you can simply left-click without aiming to jab in front of you with a knife while a weapon is equipped. Your inventory is always open and off to the side, so mousewheel up and down will select different items or weapons. Left-click will also use items if you have them selected instead of a weapon, for instance using medkits or eating canned meat. Bombs and explosive charges work similarly. Simply left-clicking will drop them at your feet while holding right-click will aim and left-click will throw. Explosives have a very short fuse and will damage the player if he/she is too close. Overall, fighting in the game is very fun, but ammunition is typically scarce. This makes ammo conservation a must as the player struggles to manage resources. Hearing the telltale *Click* after pulling the trigger on a now-empty gun is never a fun sound when there's mutants and zombies hurtling towards you at running speed.\n\nOne thing that kinda surprised me and bummed me out is that there is, in fact, no music in the game. It does make the game feel a bit creepier though, not having a soundtrack to cover up the dead silence and occasional noise. But if you absolutely need music, the developers have made a $2 "Guns and Tunes" DLC that adds music to the game as well as some additional guns. It's worth two bucks for a game like this. Alternatively, you could probably play your own music in the background just as well.\n\nThe DLC actually doesn't update the game's files with the music, which seemed kind of minimalist to me at first, and confused me because after buying it there was still no music in the game. But as it turns out, the music from the DLC instantly becomes available in your built-in Steam music player after buying. So what does this mean? Well, all you have to do to listen to your music is open the Steam music player by right-clicking "Library" and then clicking on "Music". Then, find your Teleglitch Soundtrack, select it, and hit "Play", just like you would with any game. Put it on repeat and shuffle it if you want, then you can go back to your games library and load up Teleglitch. It sounds inconvenient, but it's actually not that bad at all.\n\nI really think I'm going to enjoy playing this game over the next few weeks, So far, it's exciting to play, and creepy enough that it's uncomfortable playing it alone in the dark at night. Teleglitch seems like it has a lot of potential for the surprisingly difficult rougelike game that it is. If you are able to get this game, you would have to be hard pressed to not enjoy it.","October 30, 2014","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rainid/recommended/234390/","rainid","ChapterShield","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rainid/","434 products in account","I hold my gun up as I approach a new door, the generators roaring in the background, I peek through the opening door. Nothing is visible. I tip over slowly to the open arena as I check over my blind spots. Still, nothing. Its frustrating to see nothing within my view. Although uncertain about the location of any Biounits, I lower my sights to look for any resources on the ground. Picking up what little provisions left in this planet. I dine on my 8th Cannedmeat, despite being sick off eating this junk, there's little room to complain when trying to survive. I open up my inventory and craft myself a Cangun from the things I've accumulated this far.\n\nAs I exit the area and onto the next, a large pipe enters my field of view. Without any methods of detection, I can only pray that nothing resides inside the complex infrastructure of the pipelines. I get ready to run away as I slowly crawl near the death trap. 10 metres is the distance between me and the pipe. 10 metres was the distance I had before sprinting away the horde of Swarmbots that started chasing me after this hell hole. Low on ammo, I didn’t want to waste any more on my chasers. As I recall a Void located near a sharp turned corner and I figured I’d use it to my advantage. I approach the emanating darkness, doing a quick turn forcing the bots to fall into oblivion. My ears cringe at the echo that rips through reality as my eyes readjust from the blurred images back to my surroundings. But I quickly collect myself to finish off the remaining bots.\nI return back to the pipe room to see two Red Guards with a Twin Shotgun. I quickly retreat back behind the doors and wait to gun them as soon as they enter my sights. Reloading, I take a moment to look at the cybernetic guards that were once human. I realize that one of them was a patrol that visited my station often. He was an energetic guy that brought all kinds of restricted magazines in our isolated planet. Noticing that he was still breathing, I kneel beside, unsheathe my knife, and lay him to rest. I pick up the Twin Shotgun and head over to the next room, prepared to shoot any hostile that tries to head my way. “Goodbye, my friend.”\n\nClearing and searching through almost all of the available rooms in this facility, I reach a door that opens up to a large hanger. Despite not being a Robotic Engineer, I recognized that this was the hanger that produced a Grade A weaponry called the Blue Walker; a specialized Tactical Support Walker that shines in comparison to a normal War Walker. I bolt behind the pillars as the Walker awakens itself and aims its homing rockets towards me. Demolishing both walls and pillars, I carefully aim my shots between each interval of rockets as rotate towards a new pillar. The Walker destroys a wall that exposes a pipe to the hanger. And just my luck, another bunch of Swarmbots enter this confined room with little choice of maneuverability. Left with no other options, I blast my Cangun that I crafted earlier towards both the robots. After the usage of a stimulant, a RDX_500, and depleting all of my Rifle Ammo, the Walker finally deactivates.\n\nHalf my body is bruised and worn out, I’m growing weaker from fatigue and hunger, and am running out of both ammo and resources. But I must press forward. I will do my damnest to get out of this hell hole. I will get to the Master Teleporter and escaped back to my family and friends. I will-\n\nAs I opened the door to the next area, a Turret caught me right in the centre of its sights and shot a burst of rounds through me before I could get the doors to shut. “♥♥♥♥, f*ck. I can’t die here… I can’t!” But it was too late. I was already lying on the ground, my warm blood drenching the floor. The range and strength of my causality field have reduced to zero.. And just as I lost consciences, I hear an Assembly Bot dragging me away to somewhere else…\n\nThe next time I awake, I realize I’m no longer awake. I feel myself moving but am not controlling my body. I see myself shooting things, shooting humans like myself. Then I understand that I am not myself. That I have become the very entity I strived to escape from. That I became the same things that took control of my Guard friends. And as I look to the top of my vision, I see a log entry that says: ‘Game Over.’\n\nWould lose again 10/10","April 8, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Something more complex and longer lasting.\n\nThe guns are fun to fire. Wish there were more of them. Combining items is a pretty cool feature. Combat becomes rote, but combat in any game becomes that way once you play it a few times.\n\nI recommend it if you enjoy rogue-like games.

This game prides itself on looking very low-res and simple while having the graphical effects for its gunfire and such be a very visually outstanding point. As the gameplay goes, the game plays wonderfully and is inrecidly responsive once you get your hands around the controls and functions. There's also a VERY large variety of weapons and objects you can fire, throw, combine, and such to handle the rather large onslaughts of enemies that head your direction. Another big plus is the atmosphere of this game which is vacant, gloomy, and downright sinister at points, the ambient sounds really help hit this point home too.\n\nAs far as any negatives go? This game is HARD. Like we're talking brutal hard, here. The game does punish you for mistakes and wrong moves will often leave you with no ammo, a few points of health, and a good swarm of enemies on your tail. So let that be a warning for those going in to get this game, it WILL test you. Beyond that, the game is very solid, plays great, and has a dreadful atmosphere, and if that's your thing, you should definitely check this out!","February 13, 2014","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You feel almost like you're watching from a CCTV system. The audio is pretty clean and helps immersion. However, enemy sounds could stand some diffentiation and to be brought a bit above the noise-floor to help with recognition.\n\nThe crafting system is brillaint. You have so many options to craft from the random bits and pieces scattered about. These items can drastically change the game, or even change how you choose to play the game. It is a central mechanic, and it is thought out well, and executed just as well.\n\nThe only thing I dislike about Teleglitch is the insistance that there be limited save capability. In order to resume from Level 3, you need to clear Level 5, and so on. If you aren't terribly adept at the game, it is likely you'll only ever see the first two (boring) levels, before the difficulty curve hits a brick wall.\n\nSo, I found myself wanting to explore more of the game, especially the cryptic computer logs, but being unable because I never could clear the first few levels. This is a pretty fundamental design flaw.","January 28, 2014","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as a worker in an abandoned military facility after a teleportation experiment goes wrong, turning the facility into a blood-bath. Your goal is to make it out of this mutant-ridden facility in one piece, but doing so is very difficult. In your way stand numerous foes and halls that rewrite themselves each time you play. Adding to the problem is an overall lack of resources; budgetting your consumable items and having steady is imperitive if you want to survive. The game's aesthetics really wrap the experience up in a tight package, immersing you in the psuedo-dystopian environment. It mixes Atari-like graphics with a programming code-like GUI giving off a retro/scientific mix. Overall, I really enjoy this game. It's one of the few games that can make me truly feel panicked and alone while also being addictive enough to rope me back for another go after I've inevitably failed.

It's a top-down shooter, that somehow resembles a frightening aura about it.\n\nT:DME really makes survival a top priority.  Ammo is not found everywhere, however there are many guns, with respective bullets.  Food is extremely scarce.  Combining items is very easy, once you get the materials.  If you acquire bombs, then you can make bigger bombs.  If you make bigger bombs, you can make rocket propelled grenades.  If you make rocket propelled grenades, you can blow anything up.\n\nHowever, survival is extremely hard to achieve, as I still have yet to beat the game.  The game starts off with little monsters, that die in a few shots.  Then, eventually it grows into spawning bigger, badder monsters that will eat or shoot your face off.  That's right, they gave zombies guns.  ('Cause that's ALWAYS a good idea)!  Bosses are quite diffacult to deal with, however they are few.\n\nSo in conclusion, I really can't think of anything negative besides the diffaculty this game emits.

While there is a linear progression to the story, each time you play the various levels will be altered. Unlike some of the fps horror games like Doom3, this means that surprises will actually surprise you after your first couple plays.\n\nDon't let the blocky graphics fool you however, the game comes complete with incredible kinetic effects (mainly through the firing of your various weapons) and an intensely tight control system.

Basically, you're stuck on another planet, blah blah blah, blah blah. A little more of the story is revealed through computers, but it isn't very deep. On a more positive note the gameplay makes up for it.\n\nGameplay: 4/5\nTeleglitch is a top-down shooter that doesn't really play like a top-down shooter. You are often stuck with little or no ammo. The controls could've been better, but they are sufficient. The inventory can get on your nerves at times, as you have too much stuff to carry and too little room. It also has a small crafting system, but you are often left without sufficient supplies. Teleglitch is a rougelike. The difficlty is frustrating, but every time you die, you always come back to Teleglitch, thinking you can make it to the next level.\n\nGraphics: 5/5\nThe art style is minimalistic, but amazing. The environments look old and rusty, like you would expect from an abondoned military complex.\n\nSound: 5/5\nThe sound is one of my favorite parts. The entire game is filled with empty silence, except for the sound of your shoes hitting the ground and the monsters attacking you. It makes you feel like you are there.\n\nTotal: 16/20","October 19, 2013","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's fast and feels impossible to beat in the beginning, but you'll eventually make it to level 2 a couple of times. If you're lucky. Then you'll die only to see all your equipment and weapons vanish. IF, by some miracle, you happen to make it all the way to level 5 don't count on it you'll be able to start your runs from any of the two level 3s (some levels have two variants). There's more checkpoints but you probably won't reach them anyway.\n\nOh, there's also some crafting, secret rooms and shortcuts (e.g. if you're completely insane you can beat some sort of minibosses (minibosses, as in there's more than one to beat) in level 3 to skip level 4 (which leaves you with barely any ammo and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons in a level you're completel unprepared for)).\n\nI really enjoy a run from time to time (it's not like they take long, I die quite often and so will you), but it's entirely possible that I spend an entire night on countless attempts to reach a new checkpoint usually I don't. The game being really challenging makes each new level you reach feel extremely rewarding, it reminds me a lot of those old games where you weren't spoonfed and I had to get my Dad to beat some level or the other. Unlike some other games, where the devs simply pumped the monsters attack dmg/hp to insane levels to make it harder, Teleglitch feels well balanced.","July 12, 2014","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
