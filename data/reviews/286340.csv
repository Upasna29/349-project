It's virtually an underwater version of minecraft, with rebuilding your sub as endgame. No sandbox mode, just 3 slightly different versions of a survival mode. I rarely see anyone with more than 10 hours of gameplay because really there's only about 5 in this before you have nothing left to do, with no real wish for a replay.\n\nPersonally, I suggest Subnautica for those interested in this, as it has regular updates and dev's that care.","January 13","false","7.1"," 301 of 331 people (91%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","91","301","331","14","0"

Fantabulous","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cpt_fantabulous/","668 products in account","I really want to recommend this game.\n\nIt has a really cool premise and it is pretty well realised.\n\nThe problem is that it is short as all hell. Unlike other "Minecraft-like" games out there this really does have a hard end point to it. Your objective is to collect all the pieces of your sub so that you can get back to the surface(which doesn't ,make sense but whatever VIDEO GAMES!) and once you have them all that is pretty much it.\n\nYou do unlock a sandbox mode but in playing the main game you will see everything the game has to offer. With the lack of mods and the Developer stating that they will not be adding any more content it is kinda hard to recommend.\n\nIt also has one of the worse save functions around. To save you have to quit out of your game completely. That would only be mildly annoying if the game didn't have a nasty habit of crashing to desktop. I stopped playing the game for a week after the game crashed as soon as I found the final piece of the sub. Losing me near to an hour of gameplay.\n\nSo in summation\n+Cool Premise\n+Nice Graphics\n+Nice Atmosphere\n-Very Short\n-No future support\n-terrible save function\n-Crashes alot\n","October 10, 2014","false","2.5"," 429 of 503 people (85%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","85","429","503","9","0"

Been following/covering it since it was in alpha, and let me tell you, it's come a long way. I haven't checked out too much of the release version yet, but I'm having a lot of fun so far. It's pretty impressive that it was all done by one guy.\n\nThe base difficulty is pretty reasonable. Weapons take a while to get and killing fish for food draws blood, which means you'll have sharks coming around and being jerks. Growing potatoes also takes a reasonably long time as well.\n\nIf you're into hanging around underwater, building houses and riding around with an underwater scooter, you should get this game.\n\nPutting this at the bottom so it doesn't get in the way of the review itself.

The object is to survive below water and reconstruct your submarine to get yourself back to the surface.\n\nThis game does offer a sandbox version to it, which has its limit of replayability.  You can play this game in 3 modes, adventurer, which is how everyone starts off (allows death and respawning). Survival mode where you have just one life and submarine pieces are harder to locate and sandbox mode which in some part requires you have played a few games in the first 2 modes to be able to play sandbox mode.\n\nThe game offers a grand total 8 predators that you can fight and kill in the game and 3 of the 8 are sharks, so really 6 different predators if you count sharks as one type.  AGAIN, this is an abandoned early access game thus why variety in predators is lacking.  Also, you have a grand total of 3 tools, also because it was abandoned.  This game has only 5 ores you can mine (not including crystals) to use in crafting...again lack of depth due to abandonment by developers.\n\nI have put many hours of game time into this game, most of which was done in early access hoping this game would get better and have more depth added to it, but like many other I was sorely misled that this game would become as great as its developers claimed it would be.\n\nThis game is absolutely fun to play, but can be played and won within 2-3 hours of game time. I still play this game often to see if I can beat it faster than the time before.  However, this makes the current asking price of $15 USD a ridiculous amount to ask for 2-3 hours of game play.  I DO RECOMMEND this game, as it IS GREAT to play!!!  But do not buy this game unless it is on sale at 33% off OR MORE.\n\nI struggled long and hard whether this game would get a thumbs up or thumbs down and I have to give it thumbs down as it is an abandoned game by its developers and it is criminally over priced for what it offers.  I do recommend buying it ONLY if it is on sale.\n\n\n\n","July 19, 2015","false","158.1"," 319 of 395 people (81%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","81","319","395","25","7"

The gameplay was simple, move the dolphin from the beginning of the stage to the end of the stage, avoiding or destroying obstacles in your path. But, it wasn't the gameplay that intrigued me the most about the game, it was the ambience - the sheer joy of being able to immerse myself within the superior graphics (of the time) and excellently composed music to create what felt to me the ideal oceanic environment. I still have the soundtrack on MP3, for when I wish to isolate myself within once again.\n\nWhen I purchased this game, I had high hopes that it would create a new dream of ambience, despite all of the negative reviews that I had perused, the simple gameplay mechanic really wasn't what I desired the most - in fact, it falls extremely short in depth of every other sandbox game that I have ever played. Yet, I was extremely disappointed after playing this game to realize that all of the potential for beauty that was promised was nothing more than an illusion designed simply to entice dreamers like us to waste our money on a poorly crafted attempt to make quick cash.\n\nThe music was engaging, until it became repetitive. The graphics were good, until I realized there was no way to interact. The extremely limited availability and flexibility of creation components destroys the "sandbox" quality of the game. The overly simplified equipment upgrade mechanics destroy the gameplay. The collision detection is broken. The interlude and story sequences are poorly written. There is absolutely nothing about this game that I can honestly compliment other than the fact that it had wonderful potential if the developers had not given up on it so early, but even then I just can't bring myself to admire those who choose to be lazy. I will *not* be purchasing another game from this developer ever again.\n\nI do not recommend purchasing this game based purely on disappointment that I have suffered, the empty promises, and poor overall quality of something that should have been a wonderous achievement.","November 5, 2014","false","10.6"," 416 of 531 people (78%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","78","416","531","17","8"

You can harvest resources like seaweed, fertilizer, dirt, sand, coal, iron, copper, gold, silver, crystals (they're just called crystals), and turn them to weapons, equipment, furniture, and buildings.\n\nHere are the differences between Minecraft and FarSky in terms of gameplay, not art:\n- Your tools and equipment (including armor) never break (very handy) since you need only three primary tools\n- You have three main tools: knife to cut or attack, harpoon (spear) gun, and drill (to harvest and mine all available resources, including sand)\n- You don't have to arrange items to create items. You just need to have the minimum resources to create and you can create how ever much you want.\n- Oxygen. Your character can only be outside for a limited time before you need to head back to a base to regain oxygen. It doesn't take long to refill.\n- Bases. You can't just build a base with sand, floors, walls, etc. You need to make an item that builds a base.\n- There is a plot. Which I will explain later.\n- Boss battles against a mother******in' KRAKEN. If you harvest their crystal they will attack you and your base until you die. Then they leave you alone.\n\nHere are similarities:\n- Hunger, if your hunger is up 100% you will start taking damage.\n- Mining resources and using those resources to make tools.\n- Pretty music and visuals.\n- Predators that attack more frequently at night. Never before had I had such sastifaction of killing a shark (an endangered species IRL). Nor the frustration of being attacked and killed by a shark (and pretty much anything that bites, stings, shocks, touches you even a little bit.\n- Open world exploration. You can explore deeper parts of the ocean when you have the advanced equipment to go deeper.\n\nPlot:\nYou are Nathan, a deep sea explorer of the coast of Austrialia, since everything underwater is out to kill you (including the jellyfish). For some reason, your submarine breaks apart into 9 pieces that scattered across the map. Your task is to get back all those parts and survive. You will have another researcher that will guide you and help you (a little bit). For the most part, you jump into the game with little to no help. Once you collect the 9 parts, you instantly rebuild your submarine and you can take it to the surface where you beat the game.\n\nOnce you beat the game, you can play sandbox mode.\n\nWhat's missing:\n- Bed or something to make it speed up time until morning.\n- Some kind of radar to detect enemies. You can get attacked at all sides and no idea where they are coming from, how many, then you die.\n- More story or tasks. I like that there is something more than surviving. Maybe look for lost treasure or something.\n- More creative ability like in Minecraft to build and do whatever you want.\n\n8/10.","February 1, 2015","true","3.3"," 220 of 266 people (83%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","83","220","266","23","0"

After a bit though, I had finished and waited for the next update. Only, there was no next update. I had heard there might be more added, but since the devs now claim this is the full game, I feel ripped off. It looked like more was going to be added on with more depths that we can go to, but that never happened. Quite frankly, this is not what invested 15 bucks in and this 'finished game' is definitely not finished. Yes it's a fun game, but when you're expecting more and more updates to come out, to find out that they no longer update it, that's a bit of a ♥♥♥♥ off. There are a lot better games to invest 15 bucks in, Terraria is cheaper and has a way larger amount of content. So rather than give these devs who just dropped the game and said 'it's finished', go give your money to devs who actually still do update their games with new content, even after it's supposedly finished.\n\nIt's really sad. This game had so much promise and yet, we get the short end of the stick with a game not even worth it's price tag.","March 31, 2015","false","0.6"," 194 of 237 people (82%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","82","194","237","10","0"

It is also essentially a tech demo.\n\nI cannot recommend it, mostly because there isn't much to it. There's no story to follow, the environment doesn't invite exploration, and the combat is unchallenging (although I appreciate the fact that it can be avoided almost completely). None of these is obligatory - if the game had just one strong feature, it would be enough. Sadly, it has none. The game's mood lasted for about ten minutes.\n\nThere is no interesting activity involved in finding resources, mining, or crafting - these systems exist in the game in a bare bones, token form. Base construction is essentially pointless: you may need to expand a bit in order to make room for crops, but that's it. You don't get to build anything pretty or impressive. Exploration is minimal: there are three "depth levels", each with its own look, but there's no constant re-discovery, like in games that actually manage to generate interesting landscapes. Everything looks the same here, and there's no storytelling through decorations. Pacing is non-existent, save for increased danger during the night. The winning strategy is to hide in the base until sunrise, which means you spend a few minutes doing nothing (you cannot "go to sleep" and jump forward).\n\nUnless you're specifically interested in performing a series of simplistic tasks in an underwater setting without thinking about it too much, this game has nothing to offer.","September 30, 2014","false","4.1"," 184 of 244 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","184","244","3","3"

Here are my thoughts.\n\nSince FarSky is tagged as "survival", "adventure", "indie", "sandbox", and "crafting", I'm obligated to compare and contrast it with Minecraft, which I also have played extensively. This game is not Minecraft. Its crafting system is much simpler. It has a goal, whereas Minecraft does not. It has an end; you can "win". The randomly generated world, while being large and immersive, is finite. The movement mechanics are much different as you're under water. The terrain cannot be deconstructed, but minerals can be mined from it.\n\nThe graphics are relatively simple, yet work quite well. All the plants and animals under the sea have convincing movements. The enviroment itself is very well done, between the day/night cycles, and the way it fades into a blue haze at a distance.\n\nThe game mechanics were fun. I could get around without any trouble. The combat system is not overly complex. It can be difficult, especially at night in the first days of the Survival mode, but becomes effortless later on.\n\nThe premise is that your submarine broke into 9 pieces during a dive, and you are marooned on the bottom of the ocean floor. You must survive, equip yourself, and find the 9 pieces of your submarine. Once you do, it will assemble, and you can ascend to the surface, thereby winning the game. The game itself is relatively short. I have been everywhere, done everything, and beat it 3 times, for a total of 25 hours.","November 3, 2014","true","33.3"," 104 of 137 people (76%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","76","104","137","9","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Argonov/recommended/286340/","Argonov","R KELLY'S JARATE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Argonov/","383 products in account","I really want to recommend this game. It has a fantastic atmosphere and at times can really make you stress out (in the suspenseful way).\n\nGraphics                 - 6/10 not the best, but far from the worst\nStory                       - 2/10 There atually is a story, but it was very basic and uninteresting\ndepth of gameplay - 3/10 no pun intended, this game is very shallow\nsound track             - 7/10 would be 10/10 but it wasn't very present in game\nDifficulty                 - 2/10 It really wasnt that difficult or challenging\nOverall                    - 4/10 Sub average\n\nThe graphics made the game easy to look at and the areas below 250m were beautiful. There are a lot of pretty lights and the creature designs get very creative.\n\nThe story is that you crash a submarine and it breaks to pieces and you have to put it back together. That is all there is to it. I may have missed something, but it did not explain who I am, or who the person is guiding me through this survival disaster. There is no putting the submarine together, it just happens. There are bases scattered in various areas with little explanation and it actually defeats the purpose of building your own base, which is a big part of sandbox games. The point of building the sub is not so you can continue whatever mission you had to complete, which would have made the game very interesting, but so you can float to the surface and be rescued. (none of this is a spoiler because the whole story is literally handed to you in the first 5 mins of the game). If you just build a water scooter, you can swim up to the surface but it blocks you with an invisible wall at 30m which just killed the immersion, and explains why building the sub to complete your mission is a much more intersting story prospect.\n\nDepth of gameplay\nThere jus isnt much to it. I will compare it to minecraft for this one. In minecraft, you make your own story because there is none. You mine resources for armor and weapons because they always break. You build multiple homes in different locations because it is beneficial. This game has none of that. You make an armor piece and you respwn with it when you die. When you die, you don't reload. You just magically reapear in your first base. All your droped loot is marked on the map and stored for easy access when you go back to it. It is really hard to get into this game because it honestly felt like the game was rushing me to beat it.\n\nThis game actually had a very good sound track. It was very ambient and soothing. The suspenseful sound track that plays when you attack a certain preditor is okay, but the ambient music more than makes up for it. My only complaint is that it didn't play enough in game. And the game only took about 2 hours to beat and I was taking my time with it, so if it played the same ambient track on a loop, I would not have gotten tired.\n\nThis game is not hard at all. I feel like survivor mode (unlocked by beating normal mode) would be kind of hard because there are more preditors, the sub parts arent marked on the map, and you only get one life. I'd try it but honestly, I'd either die and move on, or reach a point and get bored from always having to roam the ocean floor in a grid trying to find these parts, which even though they are engulfed in giant obvious glowing lights, only become visible when you get close.\n\nOverall I can't recommend it for the above reasons as well as two other reasons. One is that it is not worth $14.99 USD and the other is that the dev gave up on it already. Even though people still buy this game, the developer got lazy and the odds of another update, more content, or even just paid DLC are probably zero. I will not be buying another game by this developer, and I will steer anyone away from this game that I can.","April 9, 2015","false","3.3"," 46 of 57 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","46","57","3","0"

Maybe add a difficulty setting other than spawn control in only the sandbox mode?\n-I never used late game equiptment at all, it's not even needed to dive to the deepest part of the ocean and win the game.\n-Once you get to the deeper parts of the ocean, the noise starts getting all buggy and you can't hear enemies anymore as well as other sounds that should be there.\n-There is virtually no late game. The bottom of the ocean is actually easier to survive in than the shallow area you start in. the late game boss enemies don't even attack until provoked.\n-While there are some cool things you can do with building, a small two room base will do you just as good as a massive fancy base.\n**and finally my biggest problem with this game**\n-During adventure mode you earn money to use in the sand box mode for free play. Okay, awesome. However you can only use this money ONCE, for ONE sand box game! After completing the adventure mode and Survival mode with gathering as much money as possible I started a sand box game with everything I wanted :) And then I tried starting another sandbox game, with no money to actually start with anything... So to play sand box and actually have enough money to start with the fun items you have to spend hours in the regular game -_- each time...\n\nSo....\nThere are a lot of things I find annoying with the game play.

This is the pivot that FarSky works on. You are a survivor of a submarine crash and need to survive long enough to retrieve the pieces of your craft and make it to safety.\n\nYou learn to watch your oxygen. Your hunger. Your injuries. Depth. Daylight. Materials. Predators. There's a tight little game here.\n\nUnfortunately the experience is a little shallow. Building your base is fun, but beyond the crafting tables and a small crop of vegetables, there's not a lot to do. Exploration is mandatory and soon enough you get into the gameplay loop of guessing when it's dawn, scooting out to find a little more resources, or travel a little further down. The world is procedurally generated, so that's both fun and frustrating in equal measures.\n\nIt's probably a nice game to play for a weekend. Music is nice and the graphics are at times stunning despite their simplicity.

The gameplay and controls are fairly obvious, nothing obviously counter intuitive or difficult to understand.\n\nThe initial survival mode doesn't take too long to get through. I didn't bother with the second survival mode, but it might be an interesting way to really make the game longer.

They just go straight pretty much.\n\nWhen I was reaching the end of my time with Far Sky, I killed a whale to see if I could.

I also tried to lure a Kraken to the surface. I'm not sure when I lost it, but it followed me pretty high up. So you know, there are some things to do in the end game.

It's not as in-depth as some other survival games on the market, but still offers base building, base defense, mining, crafting, a hunger system, and combat.  Here, you take on the role of Nathan who crashed his submarine and must find his ship parts in order to escape (sort of like "Sir, You Are Being Hunted").  There's a sandbox available and the gold you find in the campaign can be spent equipping your character from the onset.  The ambience is a bit cartoony like "The Long Dark", but still remains beautiful to look at.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whyessew/recommended/286340/","whyessew","MarquisDeSade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whyessew/","13 products in account","I bought FarSky on a whim. I had some extra cash to spare and the concept of the game looked compelling enough for me. Since I've finished the initial "campaign mission"/"adventure mode". I think I'm qualified to review the game.\n\nGRAPHICS (9/10):\n\nI was hooked by the graphics in FarSky. I'm serious, the game looks great. It doesn't sink into the "box/block aesthetic" that most voxel-based sandbox survival games like to fall into. For a game built on Java, it looks pretty fantastic. If there's anything that this game does great it's the graphics. It's appropriately minimalistic when it needs to and appropriately detailed when it needs to. No two landscapes look the same, and while there are certain patterns as to where things appear—these patterns never look too obvious.\n\nWhile textures might fade in and out sometimes—the game's still in a early dev stage and it's probably a problem that will be fixed later in a patch or something.\n\n\nSOUNDTRACK/SOUND EFFECTS (7/10):\n\nThe music does a good job in setting a tone for the game. A good word to describe the soundtrack for the majority of the game is "melancholic". It's peaceful and it's never too distracting.  I would however, hope for more suspenseful tunes for the game during moments where the player is in trouble.\n\nSound effect wise, the game is pretty quiet. Whilst the game itself is understandably quiet (it's set underwater...and sound doesn't travel well), the lack of sound effects make the game sometimes feel boring. I'm not saying that the game should be a smorgashboard of sounds—but it would be nice if we heard the occaisional whale call or maybe the periodical breathing of our main character. Or maybe even a low and steady hum of the drill you use.\n\n\nCONTROLS (8/10):\n\nFarSky's your bog-standard survival/voxel-based game. It handles a lot like MineCraft. I'd say that it does a pretty good job at what it's supposed to do—only for a few issues.\n\n1) In other games of similar nature, you're usually allowed to right click on resources or to split resources the way you want them. In FarSky, you can only fill a certain resource up to the maximum amount and that's it. There are no "resource distribution" controls built in the game and that can be quite frustrating.\n\n2) The swimming mechanics are kind of clunky. And for some reason—you can't crouch! I'm hoping that the "no crouching" problem could be fixed later in DLC.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY (7/10):\n\nFor what it has so far, it's pretty good. I mean, it's fun. And it will definitely kill six hours (that's how long it took me to beat the first "adventure mode") and the game has everything that it's advertised to have. You can build bases underwater, you can mine for resources underwater, you can hunt for fishes...et, cetera. There's nothing missing!\n\nBut while it's everything it's advertised to be, there aren't enough features! I'm hoping that the devs release periodic updates a la Minecraft and allow for modding support, because this game needs more content to kill more than six hours! I'll probably revisit the game sometime later, but the lack of content is kind-of a turnoff. You'd think that a game that focuses heavily on underwater exploration would have more stuff to explore right?\n\n\nOVERALL (7.5/10):\n\nI don't regret purchasing FarSky. But I just want more content. I don't care if the devs don't fix the "no crouching" problem, I just want more music, more sound effects and more gameplay elements.\n\nAs of the time I'm writing this review, this game is on sale—and it's worth the buy right now. That's if the devs add stuff. If they don't add any new features within the next few months following the posting of this review. Don't buy the game. But if you're going to buy the game now, buy it—it's worth it. And at the very least, it will kill 6 hours of your time.\n\n","April 26, 2014","true","6.3"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"

It's lovely, the gameplay is fairly smooth, and the ever-present battle against the air tank adds a little suspense, particularly before any upgrades are peformed.\n\nHowever, the game plays like a beta - there is very little content or diversity. I love a good survival/hoarding game, and this should fit the bill perfectly; however, the extremely limited crafting and resources are disappointing.\n\nWhen I purchased this, I thought it was a beta, and I continued to think that until I sat down to write this review and saw the others. It's very sad the devs are done with the game, as it could have a lot more added to it.\n\nThings I like:\n\n* Novel concept and storyline (thought it's far too short)\n* Beautiful, rich, underwater environment\n* Automated defenses, like drones and turrets\n* Extra cargo space with drones\n* Exploration which requires upgrades to complete (though it can all be seen and done within a couple of hours)\n* Increased danger from predators at night\n* Upgradable equipment\n* Automated resource extraction\n* Decent hunger/food system\n* Blood mechanics (blood in the water from injuries or hunting attracts predators)\n* Music and sound effects\n* Decent world topographical map showing major points of interest/resources\n* Decent agricultural system (but it would benefit from more options)\n\nThings I dislike:\n\n* Terrible gravity system - I understand we can't just have the ability to limitlessly ascend, but the current system is infuriatingly limited.\n* Limited crafting - number of possible objects/upgrades is very small.\n* Limited construction - More base options would be nice.\n* Storage chests are far too small and non-stackable.\n* No way to recover items after death - at least none I've found.\n* No way to sleep through the night to fast-forward\n* No way to split stacks in inventory at all - at least none I've found.\n* Some items are ridiculously expensive to craft/consume for the reward.\n* No ability to save the game without quitting.\n\nWhat I would like to see:\n\n* More diverse predators\n* More storyline\n* More biomes to explore\n* More craftable items\n* More and better base construction\n* More discoverable points of interest - different wrecks, caves, et cetera\n* More resource types\n* Less expensive cooking - each item of cooked food takes 1 coal, which can be difficult to find\n\nI got this on sale for less than $5, and it was definitely worth that amount. I might even say it's worth the $14.99 if you're the sort of person who doesn't want a seriously challenging game, and are more in the mood to mindlessly (in a pleasant way) gather resources and live out your life on the ocean floor.\n\nStill, it could be so much more.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WonderGamer/recommended/286340/","WonderGamer","WonderGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WonderGamer/","1744 products in account","Nice little underwater twist that Minecraft players are going to enjoy.  The terrain in the game is smoother, so it's not exactly a voxel game, but rogue-like to be sure.  The only issue is that the developer felt it was necessary to cut development on the game early (I'll give the developer credit for being honest, but a lot of people are not happy about this), so the capabilities of what you can craft in the game is easily lacking when you look at the number of other voxel games on the market.  Because of the lack of content & how short the game is, I wouldn't suggest purchasing at full price, but definitely when on a sale.\n\nA few issues I'm going to note here:\nThe game does not have any means of time tracking as far as I can see, so you can easily get caught out after dark & get pummeled by attacking fish/sharks where you can't move fast enough to dodge or run from them.  If you have a weapon, you can at least defend yourself to a point, but you're still going to get hit considering it takes several spears to take most predators down.\nThere are some areas in the game that you might get stuck on the terrain (happened to me a few times in my base); a simple hop should get you moving again.\nThe game does not remember your resolution settings, so you will need to reset this every time you restart the game.\nThere is no tutorial in the game, so you may end up have to use trial & error & the Steam forums to figure out what you need to do to actually play the game.\nThe crafting requirements are displayed for things you are attempting to craft, but all you get is a small icon with no indication as to what you're looking at.  The crafting menu is simplified similar to Terraria & Starbound, but the lack of ability to find out what each icon is (not to mention some of them look very similar with only a slight color difference; take copper & gold for example), can cause confusion & isn't really helpful.\nOccasionally you'll run into sunken ships, these don't seem to have any effect in the game regardless of being shown on your map.  I would assume an unfinished feature; the only thing I can see that has any relevance to them is you will occasionally find up to 4 item chests strung around them, but with the item chests having their own map makers, there's really no reason in including a ship icon as well with no purpose other than higher probability of these chests.\nOnly a number of resources actually have map icons.  This is understandable when you consider Iron is literally everywhere, but the rarer resources are harder to find & for the most part don't have a map icon.  Dirt, Coal & Gold all have map icons, but for the most part unlimited resources do not (although Dirt & Coal apparently fit under this category).  The first resource you're going to have trouble locating is Copper & considering their is no map icon for it, you may have trouble locating it again when you need Copper as there is no way I can see to set a marker on you map.  There is however another means to do this & that is to drop an Extractor right on top of it.  This not only continues to mine the material while you're away from it, but the Extractor itself has a map icon, making it easier to re-locate it.  My suggestion on this is to always have at least one Extractor on hand so you can mark rare resource locations to come back to later.\nWhile chests with items do have map markers, chests with coins do not.  Coins are used in Sandbox mode to start you off with equipment.  While you are not required to start with equipment in sandbox mode, it does make it a lot easier to deal with.\nDroids could have been better designed.  Once you have activated one, they follow you around as a means of extra storage space for items you pick up.  The problem here is that in order to call a drone to you, you have to first locate them, then press the Activation button while targeting them.  I think a better method for this would have been to use a controller or keybinding, but unfortunately there is no easy method to call them to you.  The plus side to using drones is that any items on the drone do not get dropped if you die; only the items on your own body get dropped when you die.  Drones are a good way to safeguard items you may have found before getting back to your base without having to fear not getting back to your body after a death to retrieve those items; this works EXTREMELY well when it's getting dark & you know you're not going to get back to the base before you start getting attacked.\nThis game still easily makes it on my favorite list; it doesn't really matter if it's a short game or not, rogue-likes give games a high replay value & keeps things interesting.  As far as functionality & user-friendly is concerned, the game is lacking & not extremely easy to learn for those who haven't played voxel games before & as far as crafting is concerned, it probably has the lowest inventory capabilities of any voxel game out there.  Plus some features seem unfinished, so I can't exactly say the game is worth the $15 price tag, but if you can get the game for approximately a third of the price, you're looking at a pretty decent game.","September 8, 2014","true","30.0"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","20","30","0","2"

There's really not much content in terms of crafting and gathering, and you end up getting enough materials and making everything that you can make in the game in 4 hours. Building up your base seems a bit pointless because there really isn't much you can fill your base with, so most of the rooms you make are just empty.\nThe fun in this game is the exploration and the tense fear that you experience when you're traveling in the water at night and theres sharks everywhere, and when you hear the sound of something moving behind you in the water and you look behind you to find a shark about to take your head clean off. But once you get about 4 hours into the game, that feeling dissipates because you have enough materials and the highest level weapon you can make to where you can pretty much 1-2 hit any shark that comes your way.\nI did have a lot of fun with this game though, and the extra survivor mode (which is like hardcore modes in ARPG's where if you die, thats it game over) you get after beating the game is motivation enough to do a second playthrough. I recommend this game because its still a great game despite the lacking content.

I guess it's the ambience feeling, the imagination, etc.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are alright. You can find drones and turn them on to protect you. You can find already built bases or make your own. You can easily find food nearby when you're hungry (i.e. keeping jumping in and out of water for fish to spawn nearby). Each world is randomized as well, so yeah it is open world!\n\nThe cons though is you're crippled at the beginning, so you have to be careful. All you have is a drill at first, which can only be used for material extraction.\n\nAnother con, being the biggest, is there isn't much of a tutorial. You would think bandages could heal you, but they are only used to stop the bleeding. The only way you can replenish health is eating food. You think the drill could at least defend you a bit, but alas it does not. Wait...I need coal to cook?! you didn't tell me that! You mean I can't combine items to cook?! Speargun needs spears?

I thought I accidentally bought an early release title, but it appears that the devs just gave up and released the game the way it is.\n\nIt's a shame really, I think the idea of a minecraftish game in an underwater setting sounded pretty cool. I would like to have seen meaner and tougher enemies as when you dive deeper into the depths of the ocean rather that the slow moving jellyfinsh and friendly squid that only attack when you mess with them. I would have liked to build an underwater base with power generators and defense systems, oxygen tanks starcraft style tech tree stuff. Instead you can add a bunch of rooms to your base or just leave it as a small room, there is no real reason to make your base bigger except to make it look cooler I guess.\n\n","April 26, 2014","false","8.4"," 38 of 65 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","38","65","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/286340/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Farsky, the first title from the imaginatively titled Farsky Interactive, is a game about surviving in the ocean’s dark depths. You are Nathan, the survivor of a submarine crash who must learn to withstand the dangers of the ocean while attempting to repair his wrecked submarine and return to the surface world. Sounds easy right?  Think again.\n\nWhere this game really nails it is with the visuals. The seascape is extremely detailed, there’s kelp, seaweed, fish, and the like everywhere. Stingrays gracefully soar by overhead. Schools of many kinds of fish float by, and occasionally a shark will even swim up!\n\nFarsky, in essence, is all about adapting to the oceanic environment. You start with some very basic tools – a drill, a few seeds, and a small base where you can refill your oxygen. You will have to learn to manage your time spent exploring, unless you really enjoy drowning from running out of oxygen. Using your drill, you can collect many types of resources such as iron, copper, and gold, to craft a variety of tools, weapons, and base items. You can expand your base, create a spear gun, grow a farm, hunt fish to eat, explore the depths, etc. There are a lot of things to do!\n\nAt the start, you can only go so deep underwater. As you craft better equipment, you can stay out exploring for longer and go deeper. The deeper you go, the darker and more dangerous it gets, but the rarer resources are found at lower depths! If you go too deep without equipment, your helmet will break and you will drown. Luckily the game has a depth meter in the interface that displays your current depth along with the deepest your current equipment can handle.\n\nFarksy has a Story mode and a Sandbox mode. As you play either mode, you will find small chests of gold coins that you can use to buy starting items for Sandbox mode to give you a head start. Every map is randomly generated as well, creating a new, fresh experience each time you play.\n\nIf you like games such as Minecraft, Terraria, or even Edge of Space, you will enjoy Farsky. Other games have used an underwater setting before, but not like this. This is a fresh new concept, and Farsky has nailed it.\n\nRecommended!\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!\n\nNote - This game was provided by the publisher/deve with the request to write an unbiased, informative review.

Sure you could stay behind and hunt down the ore needed for tier 3 armour and farm resources to create a bigger base but what for? There's no secrets or anything worthy of finding besides the underwhelming kraken and the resources he guards. If you do find yourself exploring you'll soon find there's no penalty to dying making enemies non threatening and the air and food gauge pointless.\n\nOverall it's pretty to look at for 10 minutes but not for £10","May 6, 2015","false","0.9"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","0"

I usually end up having no clue what to do any dying alot. In FarSky, I had no clue what to do and kept dying alot. But in a good way.\n\nFarSky is a fairly simplistic underwater survival game, in which you are tasked with collecting 9 submarine parts to return to the surface. Easy, right? Wrong.\n\nYou are dropped in an underwater base with nothing but a diving suit and a drill, and you must get to these nine parts by your own means. Collect resources, make better equipment, and delve deeper into the depths of the ocean. FarSky is a really atmosperic game, and with it's easy game mechanics I can easily see myself diving (see wot I did der) into the game's sandbox mode, and just having a good ol' explore of the ocean floor.\n\nHowever, the ocean is no calming retreat. FarSky offers a "hunt or be hunted" type deal, in which you need to hunt for your own food, or get eaten by it. It is quite a challenging experience, but after each death I somehow want to go back and fight off the creature and get my dropped supplies.\n\nHowever, when I found out that this was not an early access game, I was a little dissapointed. The game doesn't offer many game mechanics (for exapmle there are very few things you can craft), much like a game in the beta phase would play like. It's vast ocean playground is it's saving grace, because it's lack of content really does let it down.\n\n+ The game is quite easy to get into after the first half hour or so\n+ The ocean is an atomospheric, and scary, place. FarSky shows that perfectly\n+ Offers a good central goal from the get-go. You don't feel as if you are wandering aimlessly\n\n- I would expect this amount of content from an Early Access game, not a full release.\n- Combat is very shaky. I often died (maybe b/c I suck)\n- Expanding the base is tricky and not very well done (again, maybe b/c I suck)\n\n8/10","April 26, 2014","true","8.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Food is a bigger issue early game and the predator AI is quite simple and predictable once you get to know it. Then as usual you have the crafting part which works pretty much as every other game. There's harder games out there if you're looking for a challenging survival experience. Far Sky falls more on the easy side of the survival genre.\n\nThe ambience is what got me most of the game. The visual style got me from the first moment and I loved diving deeper to more haunting scenery. It also quite translates the loneliness feeling of being underwater.\n\nOn the bad side, I feel like this game would fully blossom with modding capacity and it could have been polished a bit more. But it's still a gem in it's actual (and definitive. The dev has stated a sequel might happen but development on this game is done) state.\n\nSo TL:DR a not fully polished gem that is worth more than meet the eye.","May 17, 2015","true","22.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","1"

Not much of an issue if you're good at timing your knife swings or spear gun shots, but is still a flawed system for a game.\n- The uncontrollable Droid AI can get you into trouble if they shoot and miss a smaller predator such as a frilled shark, but hit a kraken...\n- Certain upgrades/objects are useless like the Overpowered Drill, and the harpoon turret which can actually get predators to attack you even if you just swim by due to hostile creatures' AI. I was in MORE danger than without them.\n- I'm not too bothered by visual things but I'll list some out: Objects can clip into things, e.g. seaweed going through walls and floor of a base, and krakens move right through you while in submarine.","March 28, 2015","false","21.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Basically, it revolves around collecting 10 pieces of a submarine spread about. There are 3 tiers of depths/minerals/equipment. You need the tier 1 minerals found in tier 1 depths to craft the tier 1 equipment that will allow you to reach tier 2 to mine tier 2 to craft tier 2 to reach tier 3. That's it. I've finished the game and Steam says I've played for less than an hour. A considerable chunk of that was wrestling with the unintuitive interface and restarting. The survival mechanics are rendered irrelevant by how abundant food is. All predators behave exactly the same, which means they swim aimlessly about, until they suddenly decide to come charging at you at Mach 4, and you get one second to either shoot them or be treated to the most hilariously bad shriek of pain I've heard in a while.

But if you explore a bit, the game is very worth it.\nSecond, Don't pay attention to people calling this game "minecraft, but underwater". The only thing you can build and customize right now is your base, and even so, there isn't much point in doing so, except to allow for more room for chests. The game also tells you what materials you need to craft items, so it's not much of a mystery, and you don't need a wiki to figure it out.\nThird, gathering materials is very easy. You are given an item that will collect whatever you place it on, for as long as you want it to. Not to mention they don't cost much to build, I found that I had an excess of almost every mineral, and had the best set of equipment, about 40 minutes into the game.\n\nI just finished the game, and I feel it's a bit lacking in content, but I don't regret my purchase as it's likely to get further updates. The music, atmosphere, and visuals are all outstanding, so if you are interested in the ocean and have wanted a nice relaxing underwater game, I'd say this is worth while.","April 27, 2014","true","5.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

What you see is what you get. Which is quite sad, because I myself was under the impression that the game was still in the works when I played it. It just has that sort of feel, that there's plenty to the game but there could have been more.\n\n=The Story= It's, sadly, nothing overly special. Your submarine is busted, and parts of it are scattered across the ocean floor. Some of which are in areas that are far too deep for you to reach without making better equipment. Which is good, as it gives a sort of progression to the game, and therefore makes it so you can't just go getting all the pieces and beating the game right off the bat.\n\n=The Gameplay= It's decent, and puts you in a underwater environment, setting it in a playing field not often explored in a sandbox game. The jumping (Or, swimming) system is decent too, having about seven extra 'jumps' you can take while underwater makes traveling a bit less boring. The combat is alright, so long as you're use harpoons when it comes to predators. Since the predatory fish (Baracudas and sharks, primarily) tend to charge the player, knives won't really work against them. A few good harpoons in the mouth, on the other hand...? Now that'll make them regret coming after you.\n\n=The Crafting= Was... Interesting. But a bit short. With only 3 sets of materials to craft from, it feels pretty lacking. Especially the last equipment set, which only serves to give you a bit more protection than the prior sets of gear instead of letting you delve deeper in to the unknown (unlike the prior sets). Which is a real shame, considering the next part I'd like to touch on.\n\n=The Atmosphere= This aspect of the game was probably my favorite part. The first area of the game seeming pretty bright and lovely, which as you go deeper becomes darker, but lit up with luminescent plants and even glowing fish. Giving the deeper sections of the sea a sort of magical feel, but also makes them feel very foreboding as the denizens of the deep don't take too kindly to you coming in to their home.\n\nAll in all, the game is decent to play, but it's not likely you'll play it much after initially beating it, which takes only a few hours at most. A good game to get when it's on sale, but it's certainly not a good idea to buy at full price. Especially when taking in to consideration you could get quite a few good games that are finished and on sale for the price you could buy this one at full price.\n\nWere the game still in the works, I could recommend it... But it's just too lacking when it comes to being a completed project.","February 11, 2015","false","3.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

It would be a wonderful $10 game.  But it's being sold for $15.  The game engine is great.  The graphics are pretty and smooth.  The crafting aspect is fun.  The survival aspect is fun.  It just doesn't have enough length of play, and it's not early-access where you can expect to get more content later.  The developers have decided that this short game is the finished product.\n\nYou can finish through in about 8 hours of play (or less, depending on skill, but it definitely won't take more than that.  I finished in 4.5 hours first time but that was with constant nonstop play.  If I'd put it down and come back later I suspect it would have taken longer overall as I'd not have kept the player skills as fresh in my head.)\n\nIt also has a sandboxy survival mode which I haven't tried yet, but the main adventure game is a bit short.\n\nDon't get me wrong.  The shortness of play is the only thing about it that's not so great.  Other than the duration, everything else about it is wonderful.  It's defnitely very pretty.  Visually it's great to look at, especially in the late game as you go deeper and see lots of bioluminescent life forms.  It's a bit like minecraft but without the ability to alter the terrain - you just gather things and build stuff to add on top of the terrain, trying to make the necessary equipment to survive the adventure.  (For example you'll have to go down deep to finish, but your starting scuba suit can't go deep enough to get to the lower layers, so you'll have to construct a better scuba suit to be able to finish, as well as making better weaponry to survive the monstrous stuff down deep.)\n\n","September 28, 2014","true","8.3"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","16","27","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/286340/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The very idea of being trapped underwater proves unnerving and indie release FarSky takes that same concept, removes the brief comfort of an underwater city, and emphasizes the survival mechanics. Can the player gather enough supplies and fend off bloodthirsty sharks in an effort to reconstruct a submarine and reach the surface? It sounds like a grueling challenge, but FarSky offers a concise test of endurance. Nevertheless, the game makes up for the lack of longevity with a steady sense of progression and an appropriately exotic environment.\n\nFarSky spends little time on narrative—Nathan crashes in the ocean and must repair his submarine with the help of a friend on the radio. The game takes a few minutes to establish the rudimentary premise and then thrusts players into an enormous ocean, full of both marvelous wonders and deadly threats. The underwater environment itself stands out as one of the game's greatest strengths due to its novel take on the familiar survival formula. Successful games like Don't Starve and Rust also task players with surviving the elements, but oxygen tanks and barracudas aren't on the list of priorities. I found the ocean to be a refreshing change of pace.\n\nPlayers must find nine pieces of Nathan's submarine to repair it and reach the surface. The game centers on two basic but critical skills in order to reach that goal: hunting and gathering. A majority of playtime will be spent gathering materials and resources to craft better equipment, new buildings, and useful weapons to ward off the ocean's most dangerous creatures. Survival games often include a whole slew of potential items to craft, but FarSky focuses on a much smaller number and partially benefits from its restraint. It makes construction decisions easier and allows players to spend more time actually exploring the ocean.\n\nTrust me when I say there's a lot to discover in FarSky's ocean. Mineral deposits, treasure chests, and temporarily broken drones are all waiting to be found, and I felt the game was at its best when it allowed me to explore the sea at greater depths. Eventually the submarine pieces become much harder to obtain and require new equipment to reach, but the reward is twofold. First, the player finds another submarine piece and gets one step closer to beating the game. Second, it shows off the game's biggest surprises. Much like real life, rarer creatures and glowing spectacles exist deeper in the ocean.\n\nBetter materials are also found at greater depths, so take that drill out and get ready to collect some magnesium! That is, until a shark eats your face off—then it's back to square one. Players drop all items upon death, but FarSky shows mercy and pinpoints their location on the map. It's a surprisingly light penalty that hinders the game's challenge. For a game that emphasizes survival, I thought death would be a bigger deal.\n\nNevertheless, being eaten by a giant fish is still annoying and it's at that point the prey becomes the predator, especially when hunger rears its ugly head. Like any normal human being, Nathan can't function on an empty stomach. A great, albeit dangerous, way to collect food is to craft a speargun and start shooting fish. This represents another key part of the game and provides an enjoyable contrast to gathering and construction.\n\nFarSky's journey from ocean to surface is a strong and focused experience, but it also hinders the title's longevity. I appreciate a game with a clear end goal, but I can't imagine myself going back to FarSky often. The game creates randomly generated worlds, but the challenge from one playthrough to the next remains largely the same. Survival mode unlocks upon completing Adventure mode, which results in far more enemies and thus more frustration. FarSky also includes a customizable sandbox, but starting equipment must be purchased with coins found in Adventure mode. It generates incentive to play the game “right” the first time, but I like my sandbox to allow for complete freedom and in turn more insanity.\n\nFew realistic settings are more dangerous and mysterious than the depths of the ocean, and FarSky captures the duality of its environment and capitalizes on it. I was struck most by the underwater atmosphere, but the fundamentally sound-crafting elements and steady progression resulted in a fun time as well. The game may be rough around the edges—especially when one takes a look at its visuals—but it offers a worthwhile survival experience for fans of the genre.","September 15, 2015","true","11.7"," 45 of 83 people (54%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","54","45","83","7","0"

Sadly however, the world of the game may be colorful yet it just doesn't beg for me to go and explore the vast ocean and aquantic lives thriving behind it. Which actually, are not even there to the best extent. There also just isn't much to the game and nothing to do to keep me entertained or coming back to it for more. I got this on a major sale, but at the price point of $15 I don't see a reason to spend that much money on a game that just in the end leaves you feeling incomplete. After a couple hours, a couple minutes even. You become bored with nothing left to do and no reason to return to it.\n\nCollecting materials in the game are like collecting coins that really go towards nothing and serve no major purpose whats so ever. It's just there for you to grab. No story behind this game. No challenge whats  so ever. While it may be a fun time burner there are many more games in my library for me to turn to while i'm craving a survival sandbox adventure, this game just falls short of giving me that complete feeling and there's just to many competitors in this category for this game to hold a strong back bone.\n\nOn the plus side, I have had no problems with the gameplay. Runs smoothly and works fine with no bugs or malfunctions. So if it's on sale, I recommend picking it up and giving it a try. Otherwise.

The gold for the sandbox version is a good idea, however it should be permanent total, that is increased by collecting more in the story and survival modes. Having to go back into the game and replay to play another sandbox game is just enforcing replayability to get the best out of the game.\n\n\nWhat I personally would like to see, would be the following:\n1. Caves that can be explored with air pockets that only give so much air before they disappear.\n\n2. A shark frenzy, as in late game gameplay, I found that I spent a fair bit of time hunting sharks for food as opposed to being fearful.\n\n3. A possible crafting set up so we can use the materials that we harvest or a crafting guide written somewhere, like what does fertilizer do in game and how do I use it?\n\n4. The idea of multiplayer mode would be good, 2-4 player co-op would be good, any more than that and resources might become a little thin.\n\n\nWith these things in mind, I would be reluctant to suggest this game to people on the basis that there doesn't really feel very much value for money. Comparing the game to others in the same genre of sandbox/resource gathering/base-building/survival - The other games have a LOT more content and replayability for the same price. If the suggestions that I myself have made and the other players that have written the details in the review section are considered and possibly implemented, then I would definately suggest this game. At the moment, it still feels like it's in beta stage and a lot more content could be added.\n\nI'll definately be keeping a close eye on this game though, as with any future content updates could only make this gem better.","April 28, 2014","true","13.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/supahjames/recommended/286340/","supahjames","TheGreenJacket","http://steamcommunity.com/id/supahjames/","225 products in account","First off, let me begin by saying that I have a deep seated fear of the ocean. Even games like this terrify me. I also love being scared. Not that this is a horror game, mind you. This game terrified me, in a good way. I enjoyed playing it at first. However, as I began to get used to the game and discovered my objective, I began to become less and less satisfied. Overall, it has the feel of a game that is unfinished.\n\nThe premise of the game is this: You are a deep sea diver who's submarine has crashed in the middle of the ocean. Your objective is to find all nine pieces of your submarine and return to the surface. Pretty interesting, at least to me. It took me two days to complete the game. Even with the randomly generated map, I am confident that it would take me only two hours at the most to finish the game again, now that I am aware of what I am doing. Some might pose the question, "Well why don't you take time to enjoy the building and gathering of resources." The game offers no point in doing so. You can build various items, from diving gear to tables and stools. However, this is extremely limited. There are literally two decorative furniture items for indoors. There isn't much else. There's no point in using the chair and stool for asthetic when you can't even create other things. You can make a lamp and a door. Add some glass walls, etc. But that is it. It really lessens the use of the resources. You don't need a bigger house, because there is nothing to put in it. The most I began using the resources for in the end were for ammunition. *SPOILER* I didn't even build the supercharged drill or whatever the name of the device was. There was no point. I cannot stress enough how little there was to do. And collecting the submarine pieces may seem like a bit of a challenge, but the map literally tells you where they all are.\n\nWhen the download began, it only took about three minutes, so I didn't expect much in terms of graphics. But when I entered the game I was surprised. It was beautiful. It was so calm and serene to watch the manta rays swimming above me, to hear the whales echoing in the distance, and terrifying to watch the tail of a shark jet out into the fog. There was a handful of different creatures for me to meet, and feast upon, and it all moved so beautifully. The simplicity of the graphics simply seemed to credit the beauty. That's why I am so disappointed in everything else. I really wish they had worked a little harder on this. From what I recall there was quite a bit of hype when this game first appeared, but it seems the creator just shelled this out in all the excitement. Overall, I wouldn't reccomend it for the price it is at. It'd probably be a good game for children to play as, for them, it would be a bit more complicated and hard.Otherwise, don't get it.\n\nFun 3/5, Originality 2/5, Graphics 4/5, Maturity 3/5, Worth the price? 2/5 (I give a two instead of a one due to the quick download and interesting graphics)","June 2","false","5.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

For the $4.49 I have paid for during the 70% sale, I got what I paid for. However it is     questionable whether the amount of content in the game is worth $14.99.\nBeing able to 'cheese' the game doesn't help the lack of content either. 9 submarine pieces you have to collect are marked on the map and there aren't much in your way to collect them other than the water pressure and day night cycle. You will end this game under an hour if you focus on collecting the submarine parts.\nYou have no motivation to build and expand.\nUI could be better.","August 22, 2015","true","2.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

The graphics and music will captivate you as you explore the randomly generated underwater world. The art style is adorable and the explorative gameplay and struggle to survive will keep you playing... For about two hours. Once you work out how the game works, it becomes way too easy. Once you've gone to the deepest depths, you've pretty much seen it all. Late game content serves no other purpose than to allow you to kill stuff faster and explore more of the map without you needing to return back to base.\nBase-building is simple, but it works for and against the game as there could have been much more complexity to keep the players entertained, but the simplicity of it keeps the player out exploring than holed up in their base.\nEnemy variety is bland; each has differing stats but more or less have the same attack pattern/behaviour, which does not provide a challenge at all.\nI could go on, but basically this game lacks content that would make a great sandbox game. Unlike games like say Minecraft, there's not really much reason to stay and keep acquiring resources and build an extensive underwater base because there's not much of a point.\n\nHowever, the simplicity of the game is also it's strong point. It's a minimal game with quite attractive graphics whose gameplay is worth returning to once in a while to burn an hour or two. Your first time playing this game will be the best experience you'll have of this game ever. After that, well, I guess it's up to you. Personally I found myself making up random backstories and giving myself mini challenges to keep the gameplay from getting too stale.\n\nThis game had a lot of potential, and I wish there could have at least been some mods for this game to add to the lacking content.

Disturbingly so.\n\nThat being said, it is not without flaws. In Sandbox mode, specifically, there is a chance that you will find yourself on the only peak at a depth that you can handle, and thus not be able to go deeper to get the resources to build a better suit. There is also a lack of diversity in both the wildlife and the surrounding environment (yeah, it's under the ocean, but it's insanely diverse down there!).\n\nOn the bright side (I love this game, remember?) building is fun! So is hunting. The underlying systems (hunting or growing food to satiate your hunger, building better suits to go deeper, mining for resources to add to your base or build the items you need) is wonderful and addictive. The music is lovely and, despite the flaws, the environment is both colorful and reactive to your presence.\n\nAll in all, I would give this an 8 out of 10; a good game, particularly for early access.

Main game lasts about 2 hours then you unlock survival mode which is one life/tougher enemies. There's also a sandbox mode that lets you buy items with money you find in single player, as well as using the established crafting system. The game itself and its mechanics are pretty fun in the vein of "minecraft" you get iron gear to mine copper at the next level then use copper to mine deeper and so forth, but after copper there’s only one more level and then its endgame. I would love to see bigger enemies and the greater depths actually used, dived down past 350 hoping to see a megalodon or something, but nada. Would also love for it to be darker, much much darker at lower depths and at night making use of the lights you can build and making the night and lower depths much more horrifying and dangerous.

So today I played it and I have to say the positives FarOutweigh the negatives.\nI've only played two hours so far, about an hour and a half in the regular mode and half an hour in sandbox and it has really been an interesting game. The crafting chain is fairly simple and expanding your base is as well. Extractors are extremely useful in speeding up production if it's one of the first things you make.\n\nLadders and cliffs are my main negative notes, getting into base can be tedious and mean death depending if it's nighttime (as I found out when a shark attacked me with very little health b/c of hunger) and I very nearly ragequitted at having to swim back up cliffs. (Having gotten stuck for 10 minutes, and then running out of oxygen)\n\nOverall, negative points aside, it is a very interesting game, that I could potentially spend at least a dozen more hours playing.

Most sandbox games go on forever with no real point to them but there is an "ultimate goal" in FarSky: To rebuild your broken submarine and get back to the surface. It's funny to say but that part of the game  reminds me of ToeJam & Earl for the Sega Genesis.\n\nThere's peaceful music and visuals. Most creatures are passive unless blood is spilled nearby or it's night. Build up your own base or do like I did and take up residence in an abandoned base. After they're repaired and drained of water, they usually become more space than I personally need.\n\nThe downside is that the game is considered "finished" by its developer and if you experience any bugs, you're out of luck on that front. I've run into issues with collision that have made me a bit more careful in how I approach ladders/hillsides but some real tweaks there would have been nice. More than once my swimming drone has gone through the base's walls, leaving trails of bubbles in a room/corridor. It's also a bit irritating that using the underwater scooter doesn't make you fast enough to outrun the deadly night predators that will be gnawing at your flesh if you stay out too late.\n\nWith so many materials to harvest and such interesting areas to explore, I am a little disappointed that more work won't go into it. There's only basic furniture in the way of workbenches, tables and chairs to decorate your living space. I've found sunken ships half-buried in the sand but there's no way to enter them and they seem to serve no other purpose than decoration/a map marker for treasure chests. The story is also basic and doesn't really give you any true reason of why you went down there in the first place.\n\nI do love that you can use extractors to do the mining work for you while you keep exploring, and that they're retrievable so you don't have to keep making them over and over again. Hunger is a persistent mechanic but fortunately you can grow veggies in self-tending gardens--just remember to cook them for the maximum effect. You also get a lot of options for defending yourself: Weapons, drones and harpoon cannons (they're like automated turrets).\n\nI got my copy during the 2015 Steam Summer Sale and I recommend waiting for a sale to pick this up. It is fun but since the developer has admitted to having no more interest in its upkeep, a sale is the best way to feel like you got your money's worth out of a potentially short game.","June 27, 2015","true","12.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neon_cacti/recommended/286340/","neon_cacti","feed the flies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neon_cacti/","383 products in account","FarSky is a survival game where the main character is cast into the ocean depths after his submarine got destroyed. Your goal is to find all the submarine pieces or succumb to your death. As any survival game, FarSky has a hunger bar and instead of the thirst bar it has an Oxygen bar. Scattered around the bottom of the ocean are the parts for you submarine, but also random droids, dirt patches, coal patches that look like oil and chests filled with items or gold coins. To survive you will either have to farm plants or hunt of fish while upgrading your base and equipment. My experience so far was pretty negative. It feels like an undeveloped game, as if it is still Early Access and since it was published it didn't get a single update. Overall it is all very unintuitive. The hammer tool makes no sense and it took me 10 minutes to realize that somehow I removed the roof block of my house and not something else, so building is bad unless you don't mind doing mistakes and not fixing them. There is no clock and you will have little warning of when it turns to night time, the first time it happened I died. All the warning I got was "It's getting dark" and it got dark and I was eaten alive. The crafting system is pretty bad and a lot of the times you will accidentally craft something you don't need because all it takes is one press of a button, then you can delete the item as it serves no purpose. The game also doesn't feature a save button, but instead a "Save and Quit", so if you're scared of it crashing like it did for me you will have to constantly quit the game to the main menu. Another thing I want to add that so far I have no idea what the gold coins are for, perhaps for the final score? Many of the things are left unexplained and are random. Overall the game feels pretty barren.\n\n>I'd give it a 6/10. Cool concept, poorly executed\n>Pros: The graphics are pretty nice, interesting concept, offers several game-modes, tight controls.\n>Cons: Bugs, crashes, can't kill anything unless you got a Knife or other weapon(drills won't do anything), poor combat/crafting/building systems, not many explanations, no way to save the game without quitting, bad day/night cycle and you've got nothing to do while it's night time.\n\nEDIT: The game now stopped counting my playtime, and when I play it I am "Online" rather than in-game.","May 2, 2015","false","2.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coid/recommended/286340/","Coid","Catscratch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coid/","507 products in account","FarSky is an explorative survival game about crashing into the ocean and having to scavenge supplies and discover/upgrade bases in order to salvage & restore your Submarine to working condition & return back to the surface to be rescued.\nThe game is entirely Java-based from the launcher to the engine itself which while easy on the system and runs well at most low-end rigs but is riddled with bugginess. On top of mouse oddities (which are not specific to anything but include slight omuse lag, priority issues with the window and general responsiveness), there is the issue that the game never retains the settings you select for it and will reset to a Fullscreen 1024x768 resolution. You have to click 'Windowed Mode' in the settings literally every time you open it to play.\n\nLet me start with the bad stuff so as to not get you hype and then kill your hype, and instead let you decide if you want to push past these issues to enjoy the game, which is still an easily-enjoyed one.\nThe map system in FarSky is a bit odd in the sense that it only lets you see a certain area quickly on your mini-map, having to instead open the map up fully to review everywhere you've been. The overall map is shrouded in darkness until you visit each area, with a small splotch of what you've physically visited being retained. Furthermore, it uses a topographical system that somewhat tells you the depth of each location due to the pressure system the game has. The lower an area is the better equipment you'll need to traverse it.\nAnother issue is the slow trek of the game. Despite the movement system being something you can get used to (the walk speed is incredibly slow and encourages you to use your 5 'jumps' that are quicker instead) you'll quite possibly find yourself feeling like you're moving around the game at a slow pace. Later on in the game you can make a sort of underwater jet-ski to go quicker but it's still quite tedious. On top of this, you realise that getting all 9 of the pieces to your Submarine is the same repetitive task akin to Sir, You are Being Hunted, except the skill and strategy doesn't change. It's just do-this-9-times with no added mechanics or difficulty besides at the very end the last enemy faced which is hardly difficult.\nIn fact, the game, after you get the spear gun and a couple dozen spears (which is the ranged weapon you use), the game becomes incredibly easy. The enemy AI is a very, very simple and linear sort. If a hostile enemy sees you then it swims slightly away, turns around and charges straight at you. If it hits you, it repeats the process. However, if you shoot any of the fish/creatures that are charging, they get slowed down a bit and lose aggro to repeat the swim-then-charge-you process. If you just stand still and move slowly backwards you can easily take on literally every enemy in the game and hardly ever get hit.\n\nOn the bright side, though, the game accomplishes exactly what its creator intended it to be: A simple exploration game showcasing the beauty of the ocean. It's nowhere near as beautiful as say GTA V or even Half-Life 2 but it's more a serene, artistic, and appreciative beauty. Possibly the intended result of the game's simplistic and relatively casual combat system, the atmosphere of roaming the ocean floor and harvesting plants and minerals is somewhat relaxing due to the lacklustre amount of danger you have to worry about. Furthermore, the bountiful amount of resources you have allows you to build a pretty respectable base that one can be proud of in the game and even allow you to grow your own fruits/vegetables a little bit into the game's progression.\n\nOverall, I'd say for $15 the game is a bit pricey but if you can get the game on sale for $10 or less you won't be disappointed really. In fact, if you compare the price of games to movies in the sense that 'video games should give twice the amount of time a movie runs in gameplay hours for the same price', then it's pretty fair still. I finished the game (playing casually and somewhat exploring) in about 6 hours. I probably could have finished the entire game in three if I bothered to just complete it and I also received the game as part of a Humble Bundle so my previous movie-to-game pricing is irrelevant there.\nIt's not the best game out there but if you're a fan of survival games, then it's pretty good. It's like a smaller mix of Sir, You are Being Hunted and what Subnautica seems like (at the time of typing this review I have yet to play it) so if either of those games catch your fancy, it definitely is at least worth looking into. Definitely pick it up as part of a bundle or catch it at 50% off or more if you see it. I give it about a 7/10 I suppose.","August 29, 2015","true","10.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's pretty unique in this genre and although the game is pretty short, it's a good and fun one.\n\nThe game tells the story of Nathan, who had his submarine broken in the middle of the sea.\nAnd now he needs to survive the depth of the sea by eating, building bases and fighting dangerous creatures\n\nYou have to build bases underwater where you can refill your oxygen tank, plant/harvest seeds/food, craft weapons and develop items.\n\nWeapons are very limited, you can have a combat knife and a harpoon gun with different types of arrows.\n\nYour most useful item is your Drill, with it you can loot minerals and craft items and base parts with these. And these minerals can be found at different locations and their rarity depends on the type.\n\nYou can also use extractors and place wherever you like to drill minerals so fast.\n\nThroughout the sea you will encounter many different fishes and when killed, you can cook their meat for health and reduce hunger. Your enemies here are Sharks, Swordfish, Anglerfish and other dangerous marine creatures, plus there are Krakens too guarding super rare Crystals.\n\nAs for the objective of the Adventure Mode, You need to find 9 parts spread in different direction in the deep to fix your submarine and go back to your home.\n\nThese parts locations sometimes bring challenge, as they are all placed in location with high number of hostile creatures.\n\nAnd there is a Sandbox mode and Survival mode beside the Main Adventure one.\n\nGraphics are colorful and nice, but the textures are extremely pixelated.\n\nAnd by the way, the game runs on Java, if you don't know what that means or never played Minecraft, it means the game might runs slowly and needs a quite good PC to run smoothly, or turn off the graphics settings to the optimal performance.\n\nLastly, I recommend this game on sale, since it's very short and might gets old or boring when you craft the best items.\n\nSo get it on sale if you are interesting in Underwater Minecraft-like game!","April 25","true","2.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

This is not a great game, it is not amazing, it is good at best... but for the cost ($2.99 at the time of the review) it is not that bad. You will most likely play this for a few weeks and move on.\n\nPersonally, I tought it was ok, and I actually found it a little addicting. I feel that $2-$3 is the right price for this. It's nothing special, but can keep you having fun for a few weeks, and that's really all I was expecting from this.\n\nIf you don't mind tossing in a couple dollars($3 or less) for a decent amout of fun, this game is for you.\nIf you are looking for something great or unique, this game is not for you.\n\nPS.

Basic idea: underwater survival game.  Your goal is to survive long enough to repair your submarine, and then take it back up to the surface.  Once you beat it, you unlock Survival mode, which increases the number of predators, removes the map markers for the submarine parts (so you quite literally may have to scout the ENTIRE map to find the last piece, as I experienced today.  Seriously, there was nothing left in the entire map to uncover when I finally found it on the precipice of the lowest cliff you can safely get to.) and it only gives you one life.  No respawning and looting your corpse this time, fellas.  If you die, you lose.  The crafting is limited, the building could use some work, but all in all, a very fun (if somewhat frustrating at times) game that you should play.","April 29, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yolodomo/recommended/286340/","yolodomo","Domo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yolodomo/","623 products in account","Okay, first off, I didn't pay $14.99 for this game. It only cost $1 on Humble Bundle currently (you get this, along with 2 other games for $1). Considering what I saw on the trailer, and the price of $1, and now that I got to play the game and actually completed Adventerer mode in slightly under 2 hours (said clear time was like an hour and 3 minutes, dunno why my play time says 2 hours, probably took me 3 minutes to mess with settings, check stuff on the title screen, then start the game). In any case, onto the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n\n1. To me, I find this to be quite intriguing and original. At first glance I thought it was Minecraft underwater, but not quite as much, as gathering materials doesn't remove blocks, so in a sense, you can't dig yourself to hell or anything like that if you're a digger.\n\n2. It felt immersive and relaxing, quite a pretty game I must say. Not the "best" graphics in the world, but pleasant enough. I can only imagine how something like this would look with the Unreal engine...\n\n3. Unlike most games, at least this one had somewhat of a story (not a fantastic story, but at least it's there), which gives you a sort of purpose to continue to reach the end goal which is to repair your submarine so you can go home.\n\nAnd now...\n\nCons:\n\n1. Not much variety or complexity in equipment you can get. I managed to get the best diving gear quite easily after awhile (never did get the Overpowered Drill as I didn't find enough Crystal). However, that is one of the few problems is that it was fairly easy to get just about everything you needed to succeed, not much challenge really.\n\n2. Enemy AI is predictable. At first, shark got me off guard, I then pulled out my Spear gun and was aiming at it, watching its movement. I noticed it'll swim away a few feet, then turn around and charge directly at you. One spear shot to the shark (doesn't matter where you hit it) will deal damage and cause it to stop charging. For cautious players, wash, rinse, repeat. For those with good aim, you may be able to hit it a few more times as it swims away, preparing for another charge.\n\n3. NO MULTIPLAYER!? WHY!?!?!?\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nThere you have it. It's a short single player game if you decide you wanna play Adventurer mode. Probably endless gameplay with Sandbox mode, haven't tried it yet. As for enemies, sharks aren't the only ones in the game, as there are many other oceanic creatures you will discover, who's AI may seem abit better than the shark, but still able to easily get by them. My only disappointment is how little there is in the way of crafting, materials, building, etc. There just isn't much to play with. This game has sooo much potential to be better, loads of potential. It feels as though it's unfinished in a way, however.\n\nWould I recommend?\n\nConsidering I paid only a dollar on Humble Bundle (that's $1 USD) for this and 2 other games, then yes. It's worth at least a buck for a decent enjoyable game with a pretty atmosphere. Would I recommend at the $14.99 price however? ABSOLUTELY NOT! Either catch this game on sale, or don't buy it at all.\n\n(Since I can't choose both Thumbs Up and Thumbs Down, I'm giving it a Thumbs Up cause I paid $1 for it! Thumbs Down if you paid $14.99 for it)\n\n*EDIT as of 7/24/2015* Okay, watched a trailer of Subnautica. It looks similar to FarSky except for the fact that is looks FAR MORE developed and has a much larger underwater world of exploration, as well as more things to build, craft, gather, etc. Graphics look amazing, and it's only $19.99. Comparing Subnautica to FarSky's price of $14.99, I'd say spend that extra $5, and get Subnautica. I got lucky in getting FarSky at least for a $1 while it was on Humble Bundle one time. No way is it worth $14.99 though.","May 2, 2015","false","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You're basically dropped into a underwater survival sandbox.  The atmosphere is nice with a suitably moody setting and good sound effects.  You go about your business as you would in most other survival games by building a base, crafting better weapons and tools,  avoiding starvation,  O2 depreviation or best of all,  thrashed about in a sharks mouth.   All these survival aspects play out more or less well and the random map generation helps a lot.\n\nAnd thus, nothing is perfect.  There's a nice game here but after the first play,  it becomes more or less a speedplay routine.  Content is lacking.  That said,  the store page says it's a finished game, not a early access,  which may sound like an outrage but I actually think it's more honest in a way:  it's not pretending to ever evolve into something it's not some day.   That said, it's still a shame because there is so much potential for more content.  The graphics are decent enough overall yet somewhat dated looking,  in need of more work which is also a big shame.\n\nLast, what almost pushes this game over the edge,  is stability problems.  Luckily I was able to fix mine right away,  but many others have had issues and literally the only people around is the small community on the forum,  who are a nice helpful bunch.\n\n6/10  A slider of a game:  A delicious few bites and it's over.

It's a totally different genre (Underwater survival!) and it looks terrific! It's also very relaxing with the underwater swimming, water sounds and great music... well until you get munched on by a hungry shark or barracuda!\n\nAdventure mode is about a 4-6 hour tutorial mission that will teach you the basics of the map, biomes, materials and crafting. It's fairly easy and fun. Then there's "Survival" mode which is unlocked when you complete Adventure mode. It's more like Minecraft hardcore mode - you only get one life and the predators are much more numerous. Lastly, there's Sandbox mode which is straightforward play how you want with the settings you want but unlike creative mode in Minecraft, you can still have predators attacking and you still have to maintain hunger and air consumption to survive so it's a hybrid of creative and survival mode in other games. You do not have to reconstruct your sub in sandbox mode and if you've collected gold from treasure in the other modes, you can spend it on stuff before you start out Sandbox mode, including a sub if you want for enough gold.\n\nThis game could use a lot more content like additional building modules - you currently only get floor pieces and glass wall pieces to expand your underwater base. And it could use some more furniture and decor items for those who really like to construct diverse bases. For the adventurer types, they could add another mission level and some more exploration like underwater cavern systems and this game would be almost perfect. I could even see future DLC being colonization and city construction with NPCs!\n\nBut for what it is now, a very nice little Indie game - definitely worth the 15 bucks for a fun, relaxing underwater survival sim!\n\nDefinitely recommended.","July 21, 2014","true","28.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheKing4562/recommended/286340/","TheKing4562","Ammy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheKing4562/","229 products in account","Ok starting a few things off,\nI finished the game in story mode.\nRead other reviews of this game pior to playing it.\n\nSo this game is what it looks like, underwater Minecraft. It works good as an idea but this game is way to skimpy on the content side of things to justify continuing to play. Working into the mechnics of the game.\n\nIn story mode the game follows sortly after you somehow sunked your sub on the bottom of the Ocean...but its ok because your wearing a deep watter suit anyway and there is a unexplain Underwater base with infinte oxygen supply for some reason. The game gives you what you need to start up, tools material farms. Now you need to find the peices of your sub to escape you watery asylum...1 catch tho..some submarine parts have fallen in areas where the debpt is to deep to each to with your current suit (Perfect excuse to farm potatoes and lives underwater for the rest of your life..or at least till you get some better gear)\n\nThe Survival system in this gameis 3 aspects, Hunger, Health and Oxygen. The Hunger and Oxygen mechanic works as exected with you losing health untill you die. When you do die your items are left in a a chest for you to pick up and there is no penalties for it.\nYou are given enough food and to surive any amount of time with the only consideration of replanting the crops and since you have to go back to your base just to resupply on oxygen so its not that big of a trouble.\n(LONG STORY SORT, Its a reason to prevent you from progression to far in 1 run)\n\nNext Up is the materials system, most of the world is farmable but little to no use depending on what you harvest. They did put in enough effort for the different kind of fish you kill besides the basic ones drop different meats. Also you are given "Extrators" which are bassicaly antimater fueled extractors that never stop digging. There is a penalty for not moving your extractor tho in which the ground will become less rich with the mineral and you'll start to dig up unwanted crap that you'll propbably never use except that one time where you need a pockets full of sand for some reason.\n\nNext up is the world builder....its limted to your base and only your base..\nYou can have multiple bases if you can get the materials to craft it which involves the highest tier of crafting :P\nFor structure wise, you don't have the option of different textures but you can make intresting shapes for you home as you add room,windows and floors.\nThe Funiture system is literaly a joke with nothing but\nPlant Pot :Chest\nLarge Chest :Door\nCooker (Games equvilent to a furnace) :stool and a table\nYou may need a couple more pots for plants early game but the game random goodie box system will supply you with more than enough to survive. So what you end up with is empyte looking base with a single chair and table in the couner looking out a window with a mass ♥♥♥♥ton of planted pots upstairs. The untilies block use for this game equvilent of a crafting table are all a single block wide so they'll won't do much to anygood to help you fill up the void of which you call home.\n\nCrafting and Tools\nThe system works in tiers, the ultity blocks needed to craft the items is fairly cheap and obtain early ingame after you wrap you head around what you need to do. Better materials get you better gear to last longer and dive deeper, better items are located deeper (I hope you see where this is going). But this is where you notice something is seriously "fishy".\nThis game isn't in early acess anymore...so where are all the items...\nThe case of the matter is that they're simply not there. There are 3 tiers of debpt to reach to with 3 tier of items in the Armor menu and 2 teirs of the basic tools (The starter gear and the one you can only get when your already done with the game)\n\nWorld\nThis is where I think this game shine its best. Its guninely looks like the Ocean floor minus all the visablity of 12 feet with a fuzzy Blue tint over everything. The 3 debpts are also ok with the deepest one looking sorta rush with not being much of anything new vs the higher debpts.\n\nTL:DR / FINAL VERDICT\nI whould not recomend buying it unless under these 3 conditions\n- Dirt Cheap\n- You havn't played Jaws Unleashed (Only if the guys back then who review Jaws understood the level of ♥♥♥♥ that was comming in future years for video gamming [Jaws Unleashed is a case of 1/5 star game but as a game as you get to play a ♥♥♥♥ing shark that does ♥♥♥♥, it delivers]\n-Board to tears (I do mean literaly, you better be crying when I catch you buying this)\n\nIMO the game doesn't have little to no content to justify buying it, there is a survival mode and maybe a hardcore mode burried in there but that isn't close enough to justify purchase. Its not a level of "Bad Rats" avoid if for some reason one day you just got a inspiration to experince video games with underwater expeince or your just into underwater games to begin with that might be enough to justify buying it since it does look quite decent for what its trying to do.\n\nSide notes the according to another reviewer when this game got Greenlight the devs stop updates for the game which only can let me conclude with the lack of early acess sticker is that this is the final game.\n\n2nd Side note for some reason or another I got a headache after playing this, I don't think its this game specifically fault because from my early memories of playing Jaws Unlease I used to get headaches after playing that game for overlong periods of time. (These were both Heavily underwater games)\nAlso another case of this happening to someone not me, I have a friend who never heard or seen of Bastion. So in the process of showing him the game for some reason or another he claimed it gaved him a headache due to the way it looks. Not sure if I bumped into something intresting on how our brains work and are effected when processing a enviroment but I think it was a intresting enough to note.\nAlso I have a 32' 720P LCD TV so I don't think the monitor having a poor picture was the problem\n\n","February 6, 2015","false","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With a bit of community input, this could be a nicely varied, potentially limitless game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yolodomo/recommended/286340/","yolodomo","Domo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yolodomo/","623 products in account","Okay, first off, I didn't pay $14.99 for this game. It only cost $1 on Humble Bundle currently (you get this, along with 2 other games for $1). Considering what I saw on the trailer, and the price of $1, and now that I got to play the game and actually completed Adventerer mode in slightly under 2 hours (said clear time was like an hour and 3 minutes, dunno why my play time says 2 hours, probably took me 3 minutes to mess with settings, check stuff on the title screen, then start the game). In any case, onto the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n\n1. To me, I find this to be quite intriguing and original. At first glance I thought it was Minecraft underwater, but not quite as much, as gathering materials doesn't remove blocks, so in a sense, you can't dig yourself to hell or anything like that if you're a digger.\n\n2. It felt immersive and relaxing, quite a pretty game I must say. Not the "best" graphics in the world, but pleasant enough. I can only imagine how something like this would look with the Unreal engine...\n\n3. Unlike most games, at least this one had somewhat of a story (not a fantastic story, but at least it's there), which gives you a sort of purpose to continue to reach the end goal which is to repair your submarine so you can go home.\n\nAnd now...\n\nCons:\n\n1. Not much variety or complexity in equipment you can get. I managed to get the best diving gear quite easily after awhile (never did get the Overpowered Drill as I didn't find enough Crystal). However, that is one of the few problems is that it was fairly easy to get just about everything you needed to succeed, not much challenge really.\n\n2. Enemy AI is predictable. At first, shark got me off guard, I then pulled out my Spear gun and was aiming at it, watching its movement. I noticed it'll swim away a few feet, then turn around and charge directly at you. One spear shot to the shark (doesn't matter where you hit it) will deal damage and cause it to stop charging. For cautious players, wash, rinse, repeat. For those with good aim, you may be able to hit it a few more times as it swims away, preparing for another charge.\n\n3. NO MULTIPLAYER!? WHY!?!?!?\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nThere you have it. It's a short single player game if you decide you wanna play Adventurer mode. Probably endless gameplay with Sandbox mode, haven't tried it yet. As for enemies, sharks aren't the only ones in the game, as there are many other oceanic creatures you will discover, who's AI may seem abit better than the shark, but still able to easily get by them. My only disappointment is how little there is in the way of crafting, materials, building, etc. There just isn't much to play with. This game has sooo much potential to be better, loads of potential. It feels as though it's unfinished in a way, however.\n\nWould I recommend?\n\nConsidering I paid only a dollar on Humble Bundle (that's $1 USD) for this and 2 other games, then yes. It's worth at least a buck for a decent enjoyable game with a pretty atmosphere. Would I recommend at the $14.99 price however? ABSOLUTELY NOT! Either catch this game on sale, or don't buy it at all.\n\n(Since I can't choose both Thumbs Up and Thumbs Down, I'm giving it a Thumbs Up cause I paid $1 for it! Thumbs Down if you paid $14.99 for it)\n\n*EDIT as of 7/24/2015* Okay, watched a trailer of Subnautica. It looks similar to FarSky except for the fact that is looks FAR MORE developed and has a much larger underwater world of exploration, as well as more things to build, craft, gather, etc. Graphics look amazing, and it's only $19.99. Comparing Subnautica to FarSky's price of $14.99, I'd say spend that extra $5, and get Subnautica. I got lucky in getting FarSky at least for a $1 while it was on Humble Bundle one time. No way is it worth $14.99 though.","May 2, 2015","false","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Minecraft underwater really undersells it as a pitch, as a large part of the charm comes from the familiar-yet-alien atmosphere and gentle OST. Be warned that it lacks any form of tutorial, but if you've played similar games (like Minecraft) before then you'll pick it up very quickly - and the story mode gives it a lot more direction than most other games of this type.","April 26, 2014","true","2.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The only safe place you have is a small underwater base where you can craft new items and refill your oxygen levels before going back to your underwater adventuring. Out it in the deep waters there are sharks and other dangers waiting for you, combat is very risky and sometimes its just best to stay out of trouble if you want to stay alive. All in all this is a pretty decent survival adventure game with pretty visuals, the price tag is rather hefty for what the game is offering so you'd do best in waiting for a sale unless you're really interested.\n\n6/10","April 26, 2014","true","2.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

As a diver whos submarine just crashed and its components scattered around a procedurally generated underwater landscape you are to recover the lost components and rebuild said submarine.\n\nBefore you do, however, you need to find shelter in abandoned seabed stations (and build more, modify, repair or destroy them, they are concidered yours), grow or hunt (or be hunted) for food and mine for minerals. One should also keep an eye on the depth and air meter, as the diving equipment worn is limiting max depth, breathing time, and armor.\n\nThe sealife is interactive in that it tries to swim away if its frightened by you, ignores you if it doesn't concider you a threat or hunts for you if it does or you are leaking bodily fluids that simply attract predators.\n\nOne of the even more interesting points is that you will find underwater stations that have been damaged. When you are close enough the engine kicks in and starts flooding these stations. Repairing them will reverse the damage but will cost you some iron. As of yet I have not actually seen a base being damaged, but I suspect that the squids or sharks will pound a station if a hunted player enters them for shelter.\n\nAs this game is still in active development I have high hopes. The game seems done as is, and is well worth the full price.","September 26, 2014","true","9.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

No Achievements no trading cards but it's a lot of fun and I would recommend it to anyone who likes adventrue and exciting gameplay. I have built over 50 Auto turrets and had 6 bases that i had protected from the Giant Kraken, when I'm low on air and running from them my turrets take care of them so they don't damage my base.

As somebody who is deathly fearful of the ocean, my first hour in the game was spent on my toes with my heart racing. Then I started to ease into the experience. The calming music, the awe inspiring imagery, and the sensation of being safe washing over you every time you step into your base. Out of the 3 and a half hours it took for me to beat the first mode of the game, I wasn't bored for a single second.\n\nThis game brings out real, powerful emotions in me. The surge of panic when you hear rushing water around you and know that a predator is about to make contact with you. The gut wrenching feeling when you jump over a cliff and careen downwards into an entirely new ecosystem in the depths below. And the awe and wonder the first time I heard the singing of a whale and turned around to see it floating by directly over me.\n\nThe experience was short, but it was incredibly solid and memorable. I sincerely hope that a FarSky 2 comes out with more building options for your base and longer scenarios.\n\nI do not believe the game is worth the asking price of $14.99, but I got my copy in a bundle at an extremely low price. I'm sure it will go on sale for much cheaper from time to time as well. The game simply does not have enough raw content to warrant such a high price, but the experience is well worth getting it on sale.","July 23, 2015","true","3.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Eğer bilgisayarınızda ekran kartınız veya Java güncel değilse oyun çöker hatta daha baştan açılmaz. (64bit Windows için ayrıca 64bit Java indirmeniz bile gerekebilir) Gerekli linkleri, oyunun topluluk konu başlıkları içerisinde  Yapımcının açtığı sabit bir konuda detaylı bir biçimde bulabilrisiniz.\nOyunun kendisine gelecek olursak en kabacasından su altnda basit bir Minecraft olarak düşünebilirsiniz. Daha derinlerde daha değerli madenler vardır, ve o derinliklere inebilmek için dalış kostümünüzü geliştirmeniz gerekir. (Kask, zırh ve dalış tüpü, basit olduğunu söylemiştim) Bu oyunu indirirken aşırı detaylı öyle aman aman birşey beklemeyin, normal ''Aaa bu ne, aaa şu ne.'' diye diye oynasanız bile max 4-5 saate hikaye modunu bitirebileceğiniz bir oyundur, yine de her ne kadar basit olsada, tam bir göz zevkidir, rengarenk minaraller, bitkiler ve mercanlar, sayıları ve çeşitleri az dır, ama birleşince 4 saat oynayıp silebileceğiniz bir oyun için oldukça güzel bir atmosfer oluştururlar. Oyun dediğim gibi su altında geçtiği için Ay'ın yüzeyindeki gibi devasa zıplamalar ile haraket ederek yol alırsınız bu oyunda, ama dikkat edin oksijen tüpü sınırlıdır ve üssünüze dönmeniz gerekir. (Başlangıçta sizlere aktif ve minik bir üs(base) verilir, ancak harita üzerinde onarabileceğiniz çok daha büyükleride vardır, ayrıca kendi üssünüzü inşa edip büyütebilirsiniz.) Sandbox modu da vardır ve adından da anlaşılacağı gibi gez dolaş tarzındadır. Hikaye kısmına gelecek olursak, denizaltınız parçalanır, ve deniz tabanına düşersiniz, göreviniz haritada dağılmış olan 9 denizaltı parçasını toplayıp yeniden yüzeye çıkabilmektir.\nNot: Arkaplan müzikleri oldukça hoş.","August 29, 2015","true","4.4"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","9","17","5","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vechter/recommended/286340/","Vechter","Vechter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vechter/","146 products in account","Prepare yourself because this Review/Opinion Piece is obiviously very subjective.\n\n\nFarSky is one of the most beautiful games i've payed in a long time, not because of it's cutting edge graphics or it's brilliant cinematography, but because of it's just extremly pleasant minimalistic Art Style (which i'm a big fan of), now let me get into some more detail & tell you why.\n\nAlot of the Core Gameplay Loop resembles that of games like Minecraft in terms of gathering resources by using your handheld drill or automated extractors to then convert those resources into Construction Materials. Hunting Fish is also something you'll do, either with your knife or speargun while avoding predators like sharks (that do get attracked by the blood clouds) or if you prefer a more vegetarian approach you can also plant crops in little plant pots.\nBut while all that is fine and dandy, FarSky puts a much larger emphasis on the exploration of the Deep Sea environment.\n\nThe exploration part is where the game really shows of it's true beauty, finding the pieces of your submarine is one thing but to just swim around the ocean floor and finding that very first 150+ Meter drop into the darker depths below is a completly different thing altogether or even if it's just you running into your first Whale, listening to it's distinct cry as you swim right next to it.\n\nThere are alot of beautiful moments like that in this game, which are helped along tremendously by the games soundtrack composed by Artist [ Lapse ], it's for the most part a very minimal and peaceful soundtrack that focuses on the "sense of wonder" and doesn't try to be too in-your-face about it, but it does have some more suspense heavy tracks that play during sections where you are in deeper water or out at night.\n\nNow the game does have one major flaw, which is it's length clocking in at about 6-7 hours for my first playthrough, where i really took in all the games atmosphere and build up my base all nice & proper.\nOfcourse, some people have reportedly finished the game in 1-3 hours which i honestly blame on the default difficulty "Adventurer", which marks all the pieces of the damaged submarine on your map from the start of the game, it removes alot of the exploration aspect of the game.\nIn contrast to that the "Survivor" Difficulty that you unlock after beating the game on "Adventurer" has no map markers for the submarines pieces unless you are right untop of them, oh and it's one life only, which i honestly think is the Difficulty the game should be played on even for a first time playthrough since it adds that much needed tension.\n\nSo, whould i recommend this game? Hell yes i would, eventho this is more of a "one time experience" rather then a game you'll play for hundreds of hours like Minecraft or Terraria, because it honestly doesn't have nearly as much content to offer then those but i still think this game is worth playing just for the experience it offers.\n\nAnd hey, if it's not worth 10 bucks to you, you can always wait for a steam sale.","January 8","true","14.2"," 22 of 43 people (51%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","51","22","43","4","0"

First, there is no deformable terrain.  Mining involves pointing at a hill with a bunch of flecks of metal in it, and holding down the mining button forever until you've got all the materials you could want.  Next, base expanding is a huge pain in the ♥♥♥ and I ended up locking myself out of my base and just making it worse with every attempt to fix it.  I spent over a half hour googling and trying to figure out how to build my base the right way but it wasn't worth it.  Finally, the lack of crafting options makes the game feel very shallow -- you can build maybe a dozen things, and in the case of scuba-suit upgrades you can skip many of the tiers of gear if you point your drill at the right metal-flaked mound for a few minutes.\nThis game is basically a first person aquarium simulator with a couple extra toys to give you the illusion of depth.  I'm also under the impression devs will no longer be updating this game, due to some forum conversations.  It's not the worst game, but it feels unfinished and kludgy.

Problem is this seems to have fallen into abandonment and in the forsaken land of quick money grabs. The system is solid everything is smooth. Sadly once you understand how to play you can get to the end of this system in under 45 minutes, yes, in hardcore survival mode.\nDepth meter would make you believe you can go a lot deeper but this is limited to 3 explorable layers, arguably I would have liked to see at least 10 explorable layers to consider this a complete experience. As it is right now it is sadly anti-climatic.\n\nYes I understand this is a single dev working on it and no it doesn't mean I should proportionally lower my expectations. Everything was put in place for me to thouroughly enjoy the first 3 layers, adding a bit more depth would have been a small extra step to take and would have meant couple more layers, couple more material dependencies before going down, more crafting, stronger enemies. Hell i wouldn't even mind having the same enemy in different colors and stronger in a WoW type of fashion, I just wanted a bit more. Its an engageing experience and you want to keep playing, but you cant because there is so little content to sink your teeth in.\n\nIt was fun but did not provide enough.\n\nChange my mind, provide follow up and add depth to your game, reasons for me to want to keep playing.\nWhen you make a game and dont provide me with a way to keep playing it, to me it falls short of expectations.\nYou needed to make a small extra step forward but you did not, I question why, is it because you're overwhelmed, or lazy, or is this a cash grab ? Why would you be content eating peanuts when you could have gone the extra step that would make you able to afford a peanut plantation ?\n\nI'm sorry FarSky Interactive, I really really enjoyed the game it was very engaging experience.

It's pretty, easy, and relaxing. That being said the game is marketed as a Survival/Adventure game which should not be easy or relaxing. I made it threw both game modes without a single death, resources are so plentiful that you will never want for anything, and in most cases I beat the game without using the top tier equipment.\n\nOne concept that I liked was in order to mine one of the more rare resources you had to kill the giant squids that were protecting it. This was itroduced half way threw the game and is a fun miniboss battle. What was dissapointing was  that the squids are the hardest enemies, and there is no actuall "boss" in the game. Being able to kill the stongest enemies with early game equipment is not caracteristic of the Survival game genre.\n\nFor something that is supposed to be a Survival/Adventure game it feels like an early access game instead of a final product. As a casual game, however, it feels just right.","June 26, 2014","true","3.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I have been playing crafting/survival games for awhile now am  hooked on the genre. I tend to play horror games a lot also so when they are combined (like in 7 days to die) there is a good formula for a game. But as far as horror games go no amount of zombies or mutilated aliens or jump scares or screaming bloody murder is truly scary. The reason being is that games and movies have been all over those settings for a long time, and they have become a big repetitive. Zombies, aliens, obscene amounts of gore, thats old material.\n\nNow, what isn't old material:deep, dark oceans, drowning, massive sea monsters, and whatever that feeling is that everyone had when they were a kid and they swam in the deep end of the swimming pool, afraid somehow there was a massive shark or octopus underneath you.\n\nFarSky takes advantage of these fears, and combined with it's unique setting makes for a perfect formula of a game that fulfills the void left by the fact that there has not been any kind of game like it. Deep ocean has got to be the best grounds for a survival game there is. I just finished the game and have got to say it was fun, really fun, especially when I was running (swimming) for my life trying to get into my base before a shark ripped my arm off. And the bone chilling feeling of fragile safety being inside of my base looking out the windows at the dark, scary ocean and seeing hordes of dangerous fish really made me feel immersed in the game. Knowing that a piece of glass was all that protected you from an infinite expanse of your worst childhood nightmares was nice feature, and  Jumping off an undersea cliff really gave me a feeling of adventure. Also it got me immediately thinking about all the horrible sea monsters that could be below me, which got me thinking I need to get back to my base and go back to that feeling of safety that felt so good. I give this game a well deserved 10/10.","April 26, 2014","true","10.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I have watched Slyfoxhound play the game, and I knew I had to play it for myself. The game looks fantastic, it plays great, and there is a lot to do. I love the survival parts as building my base. I have always loved the open ocean and the marine life that lives in it, so I hope more will be added in the future. I hope in the future you can explore deeper and deeper into the ocean, and get a lot more ores and items that isnt in the current game.\n\nYou can do a lot with this game, even though it feels completed already. I want in future updates to have more base mechanics, such as better flooding and doors to stop flooding. I want to see flooding to be more dynamic, and I want to see a  emergency device will replace the flooded base with air, aswell as a device that will convert water to oxygen, and having to fill your oxygen tank with oxygen, to make it more realistic.\n\nWhile I did not encountered that much glitches in the game, I encountered one that stopped me from moving while Im in the Submarine. On Adventure Mode, after completing the game, I went to my base and got out of the Submarine. As I tried to ride it again, it wont move. Thankfully, you dont really need the Submarine anyways, as you still need oxygen to live, although the sub is very usefull.\n\nI hope there will be more updates to this game, just like Minecraft is getting updates. A lot of people compare this game to Minecraft in a way, and I think it is true. But FarSky ISNT a Minecraft clone, its a game that took a lot of inspirations from Minecraft and made it its own. I truely love this game, and I will continue playing it until I get bored of it.\n\nAlso, the entirely of the game... I think your a fish yourself. I mean... when you get hit, you make fishy noises, so I think your a fish in a scuba suit.","May 4, 2014","true","14.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But unfortunately this game is really very weak. It takes only about 3 hours, give or take, to finish it by getting the submarine and returning to the surface and there is not much meat on it bones. You can easily gather enough resource to craft a rediculous amount of high tier object which only means you need and insanly large storage facility to store them as there is not enough object variety to craft that would warrent being able to deplete your large resource stockpile. Even the high tier items are limited to being about maybe 10 things in total. The map, while randomly generated is actually small it takes about a minute or so just to cross from one end to the other, even going to the lowest depth possible isn't very rewarding as it is pretty much like the top level, lots of light with lots of undersea plants.  If your looking for a game that is good for killing small amounts of time then this game might be for you if your willing to pay $15 for what little you get.\n\nI would get a refund if I knew it were possible.","October 19, 2014","false","5.3"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","15","31","0","2"

It makes exploring in sandbox mode so much more difficult, needing to remember which way you too to get to some new resources..Few times I have died this way completely unessacary, and could easily be prevented by a compass, and/or have your base stay on your radar/map as you leave further from it.\n\nI have actual scuba training, you should have a compass, it's implimented on hookups to your tank for crying out loud with your regulator, and octopus. Also Why can you only jump like 4 or 5 times underwater? You have a BC (Boyancy control Device) Which can add or remove air from your suit which will raise or lower you by itself, let alone your legs.. Jumping up onto ledges as you rise from a far depth...what?\n\nIt's also missing alot of equipment and other things that could of easily been added to it.. Sure you got a knife, and a speargun, and spears, by why can't you use a spear as a long range melee weapon when only 1 left, or create a longer one just for it? You can only build a table, and a stool for furnature for luxury wise, and other than your workshops, theirs not much else to do besides quickly upgrading your gear.\n\nSure it has fun exploration, and it's cool to see the wild-life in action, but their isn't really much to do when you get down to it. It has abit of replay value because of the generation and the sealife cause you won't always see a blue-whale pass you by or dolphins, even anglerfish. But that can only last so long, when they missed out on the building entirely. Not much terrain reform either even from mining, the chances of getting the ore just goes down, and is replaced by rock.\n\nThe worst thing of it all though is when you die, because theirs no HUD display of your corpse,  let alone your base, it's pretty much lost, and you will never find your stuff again, and if you're like me all your non important stuff that you have plenty of is stashed away while you have all the rare materials on you. As your entire inventory, and belt is wiped out, left only with the 3 basic equipment items you have on. Many times have I just started a new game because of this.\n\nIf you want a slow-paced game focusing mainly on exploration with abit of free-building then sure this game is for you, but if you're thinking it's going to be more in line with how much other games out there like this have to offer, minecraft, the forest, 7 days to die etc, have more, and the last two are still in development. It is relaxing though, and is fun, but it kind of wears itself out quick at this rate unless they randomly come out with a patch.\n\nSo yes I recommend this game, but be aware that theirs not as much as it seems. Though note I have only played the sandbox mode so far where you should have more things to do/explore.","April 27, 2015","true","7.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It makes exploring in sandbox mode so much more difficult, needing to remember which way you too to get to some new resources..Few times I have died this way completely unessacary, and could easily be prevented by a compass, and/or have your base stay on your radar/map as you leave further from it.\n\nI have actual scuba training, you should have a compass, it's implimented on hookups to your tank for crying out loud with your regulator, and octopus. Also Why can you only jump like 4 or 5 times underwater? You have a BC (Boyancy control Device) Which can add or remove air from your suit which will raise or lower you by itself, let alone your legs.. Jumping up onto ledges as you rise from a far depth...what?\n\nIt's also missing alot of equipment and other things that could of easily been added to it.. Sure you got a knife, and a speargun, and spears, by why can't you use a spear as a long range melee weapon when only 1 left, or create a longer one just for it? You can only build a table, and a stool for furnature for luxury wise, and other than your workshops, theirs not much else to do besides quickly upgrading your gear.\n\nSure it has fun exploration, and it's cool to see the wild-life in action, but their isn't really much to do when you get down to it. It has abit of replay value because of the generation and the sealife cause you won't always see a blue-whale pass you by or dolphins, even anglerfish. But that can only last so long, when they missed out on the building entirely. Not much terrain reform either even from mining, the chances of getting the ore just goes down, and is replaced by rock.\n\nThe worst thing of it all though is when you die, because theirs no HUD display of your corpse,  let alone your base, it's pretty much lost, and you will never find your stuff again, and if you're like me all your non important stuff that you have plenty of is stashed away while you have all the rare materials on you. As your entire inventory, and belt is wiped out, left only with the 3 basic equipment items you have on. Many times have I just started a new game because of this.\n\nIf you want a slow-paced game focusing mainly on exploration with abit of free-building then sure this game is for you, but if you're thinking it's going to be more in line with how much other games out there like this have to offer, minecraft, the forest, 7 days to die etc, have more, and the last two are still in development. It is relaxing though, and is fun, but it kind of wears itself out quick at this rate unless they randomly come out with a patch.\n\nSo yes I recommend this game, but be aware that theirs not as much as it seems.

It does not suck though. I wouldn't pay full price, but at the sale price of $1.50 I think it was a great deal. It has a few hours worth of content and can actually be really challenging at times. It can be glitchy and it'll seem like the sharks are shooting up out of the ground at you sometimes, but I personally enjoyed my time playing. It seems like it had a bunch of potential but most of it was wasted, it wasn't a waste of my time or $ though. Would get my base destroyed by a Kraken while I bleed out again.

First of all, I would like to state that in my opinion this game is complete. I found no bugs, broken features or obviously missing features. It's difficult, intriguing and definitely fun to play.\n\nThe price is probably the only thing off about this game. I think it is well worth $5 to $7, but $10 is pushing it. I say this because you can get games like Terraria for the same price that provide much, much more content.\n\nThe game is built with Java, just like Minecraft, but it is a lot more resource heavy than Minecraft. I found that on an older PC I couldn't run this game at a decent FPS, even though I could run somewhat modern games easily. My new computer is not top of the line but can run it maxed out with no issues.\n\nFarSky has a short campaign that you should try to finish as quickly as possible. It isn't difficult enough. You will dream of constructing new bases only to find that the map is scattered with bases already built for you. No, what you want to do is finish the campaign quickly so you can unlock sandbox mode, which is where the real fun lies.\n\nGive it a chance next time you see it for $5 or less.","December 5, 2015","true","19.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It has very little content, it is over very fast, and the game is too repetitive to contain the sandbox mode which has been included. (everything in the game is very linear).\n\n\nThere are certainly people who would enjoy the game, but most people will experience this as a game with great promis that sadly falls short of delivering.\n\nI do hope the developers will revisit the premise at some time later and make up for this games short comings, cause seriously this game could have been far better. =)","January 23, 2015","false","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Fighting in the game was also slightly frustrating.\n\nWhat I need to make this game better: challanges, goals, achievements... (build a 5 story base, gather x resources, operate y equipment, harvest plant z, ...), multiplayer would also be a very good addition to this type of game.\n\nI can't recommend at this time sadly because I can sum up the entire game in 3 concepts: resource gathering, shooting insane fast predator fish, walk around looking for 9 pieces of submarine...","December 22, 2014","false","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has very little content, it is over very fast, and the game is too repetitive to contain the sandbox mode which has been included. (everything in the game is very linear).\n\n\nThere are certainly people who would enjoy the game, but most people will experience this as a game with great promis that sadly falls short of delivering.\n\nI do hope the developers will revisit the premise at some time later and make up for this games short comings, cause seriously this game could have been far better. =)","January 23, 2015","false","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

After you realize the drill can drill the floor, and that the floor's texture determines what you get (iron, copper, sand, etc), you'll have no shortage of ingredients. The only threats left are pressure, air supply, and various nasty fish. While the first two are easy to dodge, the viscious fish are unpredictable and more irritating than challenging - once you figure out how to actually attack (intuitive controls lacking), you'll have no trouble fending them off. (but escape is rarely an option - they will hunt you till you get into safety, hence the irritation). All in all, the survival starts off exhilarating but rapidly becomes a chore.\n\nLike in certain other creative sandbox games (which may or may not contain mines), there is a nighttime during which the nasty fishes are more numerous and aggressive. The idea being (I think?) that you go into your base and build amazing cool base parts. Except that the base can only be made from floor, walls, walls with glass, ladder to another floor, plant pot, and 5 crafting stations. Oh, and a stool and a table and some chests.

There's no creativity, the components are extremely restricted in how they can be combined, and the result is generic, boring and bland. The screenshots of the base are the most you'll ever achieve (aside from creating a boring, extremely large pile of boxes filled with plant pots).

Perhaps a bed to sleep the remainder of the night away would improve things  but...\n\nThat said, even if there was a bed, the collection of minerals is equally boring. You can either stare at a rockface with a drill or set up an extractor. Either way the minerals are ultimately just a means to upgrade your base (or reach more minerals), which, as I described above, isn't really worth doing.\n\nOnce you figure out how to do stuff (e.g. drill the terrain and that spears aren't weapons without a speargun rawr), you can quickly build the highest level suit and complete the "story".

You've got a handful of resources to keep track of, a couple weapons, a few enemies, etc. It's not complicated. But I would argue that makes it all the more fun and enjoyable; it's a very relaxing game that has enough of a "story" (well, a motivation at least) to keep you engaged and exploring but nothing that weighs heavily on the mind. You explore an ocean, progressively going deeper and deeper as you try and find the pieces of your submersible while trying not to drown or get eaten.\nWhich isn't that hard, and that's okay! FarSky is a game you sit down for a few hours, get lost in the tranquil oceans, find some pieces, escape, and eventually put away. As long as you don't pay more than ten dollars, I think you'll get your money's worth out of it.","February 4","true","8.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Initially I was really drawn to the game and wanted to p[lay it, then, I started to figure out how to findo resource, even though there are many things that could better be explained. The the rogue element kicked in, which initiall was ok...but then it starte dto get frustrating, mainly bcause a better explanation of what you needed to harvest to make things could have helped me plan what I needed to gather first. Then the aggrevation of all creatures attackiong you for no damn reason, even Jelly fish, which eben though they hurt, do NOT aggressively attack you in real life!\nThere is a LOT of find an harvest items to build stuff to harverst better items them going on...and in the middle of that, you have to crafter better weaponry to kill fish for food, which attracts predators(Sharks, Barracuda, etc.)  It can get pretty damn aggrevating sometimes...\nTHEN.... when you die, if you die AGAIN, which will happen, while enroute to getting your stuff you dropped when you died...THEN...you lose all the stuff you were after. So, hopefully you have enough iron to build a dripp or have excavators out in an iron deposit so you can harvest some to build another drill, knofe, etc... or you are screwed and starting over.\n\nThere are many addicting things to thi game. Even though the graphics are more on the simple side, there are so many wonders to behold.\n\nAt the same time, there is a SH!7 load of frustrating things going on  that don't necessarily need to be happening. Creature are not going to attack you as freuently as they do in this game.\n\nAt the end of the day, it still gets you with, ok...just one more game and I am quitting for the day...and hours later you are still playing.

I didn't expect it to be as fun as it is. It seemed like every other survival game I've played but the underwater environment changes everything. The predators are actually dangerous, you have to eat frequently, and you have to watch your oxygen and pressure levels closely. When I was being hunted, I actually felt a twinge of fear and anxiety. Of course, the music and scenery are beautiful and go together hand-in-hand. Plus the added replayability of survivor mode and sandbox mode. I'd say it's one of the better survival games available on steam. Definitely a 8/10.\n\nMy hope is that they bring more depths to the game to add with the already beautiful and expansive landscape and to make exploring that much more enjoyable.\n\nEDIT: Since reviewing the game, I have come to learn that there have been no updates or new content at all. That's a little ridiculous. I wouldn't say it's worth its price but for like $3 grab it. If they add more content and actually give a damn about the game, I'll reinstall it and change the review but as it is now, I can no longer recommend buying it.","May 6, 2015","false","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are some small drawbacks such as lack of content and a long loading time but its well worth the wait and the money buying it i do recommend waiting till it is on sale.

After playing through both Adventurer (easy) mode and Survival (hard) mode, I can say this game can be tough, but is mostly fair.  Simple crafting system, three depths that offer completely different ecosystems (fish/predators, ores that can be mined, even the seaweed rewards and appearances vary on depth).  A bit of advice if you do buy this game, on Survival mode, focus on building yourself a nice self-sustained farm first.  After you have hundreds of potatoes and carrots, you have the means to heal yourself for a long time, which is nice since one death is game over.  Other than that, save some gold then once you get copper and manganese, you can build a little army of harpoon turrets.  Every time you steal crystal which is one of the most valuable resources, krakens will come after you, which are the toughest monster in the game.  Those harpoon turrets will make quick work of them, combined with a spear gun of your own.  Took me 6 hours to fully explore the map on hard mode, but it was well worth it.","May 22, 2015","true","11.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, despite desending to depths of roughly 350m below sea level, this game is rather shallow. Once you complete the main (and only) objective, retreiving your submarine, the game loses all it's interesting aspects. You can play it for a few hours, and then never touch it again. It just feels unfinished. It something were to happen in the future, like an update that adds more to it, it might be work playing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Daled003/recommended/286340/","Daled003","Mesigno","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Daled003/","154 products in account","Far Sky is a wonderful little game in which you play as a stranded Diver who must retrieve all the parts of his submarine in order to get back to the surface and be rescued. Gameplay is largely split between a scavenger hunt-esq element in which you try to locate the pieces of your Sub and crafting elements that enable you to improve your scuba gear, weaponry and base. The controls are quite pleasent and very rarely feel slack. graphically it's no triple A title...but it's of reasonable quality and very rarely distracts from the overall gameplay. While I can reccommend picking it up at a sale price I honestly couldnt reccommend this title at full price. the main reasoning is that there really isnt that much to do in game...realistically as long as you dont bother the other fish and dont go to mad jumping around you can collect all the pieces of your submarine having never really engaged with any enemys.\n\nAlsowhile it is a lot of fun to custom build a seabase (Reinacting Sealab 2021 will always be a well appreciated thing in my book) theres only so many times you can build and re-build your base before it starts wearing a bit. The game is entirely Sandbox esq...but with it being under the ocean short of looking for the odd treasure chest theres surprisingly little down there...\n\nAnother let down would be the fact that the only other mode in the game is effectively an "Advanced" mode where you play the game as normal only now it doesnt direct you to where the submarine parts are...which will probably double your playtime but adds little to the overall game itself...\n\nAt sale price this game is a totally fun way to kill an hour or 4...and in that capacity I can really reccomend this game, it's a lot of fun!. But if it's being charged at the current full retail, the lack of alternative modes, interesting finds/easter eggs, and just general lack of anything other than the main "Find the sub" quest I cant honestly reccommend this at full price. if it's in the sale give it a try and release your inner captain murphy :)","August 17, 2015","true","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That would not be fair, because I am already thinking about what I will do when I play again.\n\nThe game is not complicated, there is a good risk reward and the randomness that happens in real life that we all hate. Suck it up cupcake, it is what it is.\n\nYou will need to balance mining/exploring/hunting to succeed, and, it will be worth it. The worlds are randomly generated so every time you start a new game, it will be different form the last.\n\nI do recommend the game. Enjoy the sights and sounds, there are many! You will not forget the first time you hear a whale!\n\nSee you in Deco!\n\nStephen","February 14","true","6.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've beaten the game twice in all 3 hours I've played it, and in both playthroughs I was taking my time.

The graphics are a bit old school but what it lacks in visual, it makes up for in enjoyment.\n\nBasically, you are stuck on the bottom of the ocean and are trying to find pieces of your ship.. meanwhile you try to survive the ocean's depths are predators. The base is a bit cut and dry, but it still fun to play around with. Food can be difficult to come by until you get some little farms up and running. Once you put some time into it, you can really get into a nice groove and work your way to the outskirts of the map. When the main objective is complete and you know longer have a set goal it can get a bit dull, but its still fun to play around on the ocean floor!\n\nAs you can see, I spent quite a bit of time on this game and I'm sure I'll pick it up again in the future.

It plays very well and looks good enough. Besides some sound bugs (for which I needed to restart the game occasionally) I had  no problems/gamebreaking bugs.\nThe game is rather short (3 hours for the story) and offers not that much replay value.\n\nUnderwater bases can be expanded but there is almost no need to do that, It's way to easy to get food and once you figured out the Predator A.I. the game gets quite easy.\nBUT it was fun. At least for me.\nI have a fear of deep water. That means for me it was an Underwater-Survial-Building-Horror game.  Drilling ores without knowing whats behind/above/next to you  makes the athmosphere tense. Especially in night time in which enemies get more aggressive and attack for no apparent reason.\nSome ores are too rare (liek silver) which makes it hard to build some tools. I only found 2 silver ores within the entire story. Probably I'm just unlucky.\n\nEven tho the story was dull and the game a bit too easy, the tense athmosphere with it's fitting music and the exploration of these hostile waters made it a very nice experience.","May 12","true","6.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I probably shouldn't have spent so much time of my life with this sparkly little turd, but we all have our guilty pleasures yeah?\n\nStory:\n\nFarSky is a game about returning to the surface of the ocean after some unexplained disaster has caused your submarine to be destroyed. You play as Nathan, and are (I hesitate to use this word) 'guided' by some woman Nathan aparently knows. Early in the game she gives you two good survival tips, and after that her and Nathan's dialogue is practically non-existant. She does however inform Nathan that once he fixes his submarine and reaches the surface, she will be able to send a rescue team after him.\n\nBehind the Scenes:\n\nPositive Points:\n+Simple control scheme. It only took me about ten minutes to get comfortable with the controls and stop pulling up my inventory at awkward times.\n\n+Pretty visuals. While this is by no means a graphic monument, some of the scenery is very nice and it's fun to look at the various sea creatures.\n\n+Not a difficult game. You don't need to have any particular skill set to finish the game.\n\n+Easy crafting system. The items you need to make something are shown to you, and simply having them in your inventory will allow you to make it.\n\nNegative Points:\n\n-Getting food: With how rapidly enemy aggro builds vs how easy it is to shake aggro, hunting fish for food is a daunting task that barely even provides for you. Growing crops also takes a long time and unless you build a large farming area fairly quickly, you won't be able to stockpile enough to keep you full either.\n\n-No replay value. Sorry. Actually, playing it for a couple hours will give you all the game play value.\n\n-Minimal music or sound scores aside from enemies and character generated noises. There is some relaxing music that plays at night time, but other than that there are maybe 2 music tracks?\n\n-Difficult combat system. Fighting wild life just doesn't work underwater folks. The knife doesn't do nearly enough damage to be worth using, and firing the spear gun is more trouble than it's worth too. (This coming from a guy who's been playing Gears of War and Unreal Tournament the past five years.)\n\n-Enemy aggo: Basically if you pee in one fishes cornflakes, you are going to have an entire ocean coming after you. Enemies will come at you from a ridiculous distance and won't stop until you get back inside your base. Even if you kill a fish and leg it out of the area, one drop of blood is enough.\n\nNeutral Points:\n\nEasily exploitable. I'm not saying I don't exploit the game and have fun doing it, but a well made game shouldn't have too many ways to get around things that is based on trickery, not skill.\n\nClipping issues? I'm not sure if this is just because my computer isn't designed for any sort of gaming, but I've noticed that many times I'll have enemies randomly plow through my base or a solid rock wall with no apparent effect on me.\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\nFarSky is about building a submarine and getting back to the surface of the ocean. It has a couple things that make it worth a three or four hour play, but anything past that isn't all that satisfying. There are one or two good points of the game, but a slew of issues that suggest it was abandoned during development. Thankfully, nothing game breaking. If you can get this game on sale or through SteamShare give it a go, otherwise I'd advise giving this one a pass.\n","November 11, 2015","false","10.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I honestly can't really see myself going back to play the game again but for what is was, it offered me great fun.\n\nThere are a lot of things to improve and the price of $10 is honestly not worth it from the amount of gameplay you get.\nIf you plan on buying Farsky, I recommend you wait for it to go on sale.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tadmeister69/recommended/286340/","tadmeister69","tadmeister69","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tadmeister69/","290 products in account","First let me say that I actually REALLY ENJOYED THIS GAME (despite giving it a thumbs down)! The atmosphere, sounds, graphics and gameplay are all great and I can see the Dev has put a lot of effort into producing what is here; however that unfrotunately is the problem - for the price of this game there just isn't enough content, which really is a shame considering how good this game could be with more development!\n\nI played adventure mode for 4 hours before I completed my submarine and was able to surface (effectively the end of the game). This was while taking my time to fully enjoy the game (I could have easily reached this point within 2 hours) - I'd fixed 3 other bases i found, build my own base, setup a harpoon array protecting my base, setup a miniture farm (growing potatoes, beans & carrots) built all in game objects and taken on the krackens while stealing their crystals (although I'm still not sure if they have a use...).  I'd say I really enjoyed the first 2 hours, but after that I was really just looking for more to do, and unfortunately there just wasn't anything else.  By the end this really made the game feel like a shallow experience (excuse the pun), where so much more could have been achieved with more content and structure.  I've started survivor mode but it does seem like more of the same, just you only have 1 life, and I'm not big on the permadeath thing, so while this miht be a big draw for some it doesn't add extra life to the game for me.\n\nIf this was half the price, in Early Access or if the dev adds additional content I'd give this a thumbs up for sure, but for a finished product on Steam for £10, I just really can't recommend it as it is currently.  Not when there are some fantastic games on steam for a third of the price.\n\n\nI really hope the dev takes this constructively and adds more content, as I'd love to play more (and I will deffinitely keep an eye ourr for more oth their games)! Here are some suggestions I'd have for if the dev ever wanted to add more content or create DLC for this game;\n- add more environments (caves, shipwrecks, abyss etc)\n- add some side missions (maybe related to why he's down there in the first place?)\n- maybe create some exploratory missions (i.e. you have to find the bases down there to get something hidden in each)\n- make fixing the sub harder (currently you just find 9 pieces and it appears.  Maybe you could have to fix or power the sub too)\n- add areas of individuality to make it worth exploring (maybe things like coral gardens or the formentioned environments)\n- more things to do with you living space (if the game was longer I could see myself wanting to make this more like a temporary home)\n- more gradients for suite depth. Currently i just built one suit and could go straight to 350m.\n- more things to build/craft and more ores to find.","April 29, 2014","false","7.7"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

FarSky is light on story as well as content.\n\nThe game will take most people two hours tops to finish. It is an underwater exploration game where you must find 9 pieces of your broken submarine to escape. Most of your time will be spent scaging for supplies, which are mostly easy to find and unlimited (minus a few rare items, like gold) once found. The game isn't very diffucult, though predators (sharks, etc) will kill you on sight, rarely is there a chance to escape, and at night time they are everywhere, leaving you standing in base for minutes at a time doing nothing.\n\nThe atmosphere is fantastic though, you really feel like you are explording the unknown of the ocean and fearful of what you might encounter next, and also the pure lonelyness of being at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nOnce the main mode is finished, you unlike a harder variation of it, that gives you one life. I only used 4 lives during my playthrough.\n\nThere is a sandbox mode where you can use coins found in the normal mode to buy objects and use them as you see fit, but the building options and crafting is pretty limited, so I don't see it having very long legs. The only things you can craft are pieces of equipment, food, weapons, and bases / furniture, something uneeded in the core game.\n\nFor $15 the asking price is a bit much. This game would be easily recommendable at $5, but in the current form and price I can't recommend anyone buy it, unless they just can't help but want to get mauled by sharks underwater.\n\nI can say I did have fun with the game while it lasted, it is an enjoyable experience, it just ends too soon and doesn't feel like a fully realized concept, just the tip, if you will.\n\nIf you'd like to see what the game is like here is a fully playthrough of the original mode by yours truely. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzOSSXPoCAs","April 29, 2014","false","2.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I has great potential, but it never quite became the awesome game it should have been.\n\nCrafting...\nThe crafting is pretty week. You access the crafting table and choose the item you want, if you have the correct ingrediants in your inventory, the item is instantly made.\n\nNone of the items are complicated at all. Use 20 copper ore, 2 gold, and POOF, you have an underwater scooter. There is no refining of minerals, there is no crafting of smaller components to later build a more complicated item.\n\nAlso if you want to build something , but don't have the ingrediants it will show you tiny little icons of what you need, but it doesn't say what those icons are. For example I needed to make a bandage to stop my bleeding, and it needed seaweed, but the icon didn't look like seaweed and I could find anything that I was harvesting that had an icon that looked like the one shown.\n\nOne last thing about the crafting. The ore to mine is everywhere. You are litterly surrounded by it. There is more ore around you then just regular stone.\n\nGraphics...\nThe game looks very beautiful lots of underwater eye candy, The best part of the game is the look and feel of your surroundings.\n\nSound...\nSound isn't too bad, but when night comes you get some fairly bad music start to play. seems like they were trying to copy minecraft here, but where mine craft music is peaceful sounding, this music doesn't give me that feeling.\n\nThe combat is also pretty week. The fish AI is basically always the same from every fish...charge at you at high speed straight on.\n\nThis game could have been so much better, but it feels like a game that is still in Alpha, but it is a finished game.\n\n\n","October 8, 2014","false","2.2"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"

The scenery is pleasant from my short time playing. I would spend more time with it, but the game spans my dual monitor setup in both full screen and windowed mode making all the center game action fall on the gap between my two monitors. There seems to be no adjustment for window size and I've been unable to find any tips or tricks in the forum to overcome this shortcoming. There seems to be very little activity in the forums from the dev and forum chatter is that the dev is done with this game and is/has moved on to something else. I do feel cheated, as I could not play the game in a suitable way and there may never be fixes.\n\nMaybe this game and other projects like it should have a Steam category like: Temporal, Short run, Test bed, etc. Something identifying such projects as something with short lived dev updates and support. The price for such games should have a cap as well.

I have tried so many different things and nothing has worked.

That was about 3 months ago and still no such patch.

These are:\n1)Underwater gameplay\n2)Craftable drills that mine resources for you.\n3)Swimming Mule-gundrones.\n\nOther differances are alternative versions of minecraft gameplay(Drill=Pickaxe Harpoon=Bow etc)\n\nThe crafting system has much less to offer then minecraft. In fact There are less then 40 recepies(Minecraft has almost 100 or maybe more).\n\nThe bigest problem though is the exploration, The player is always limited to maximum presure of used diving suit, What realy hurts is that  one ore that is required to make better helmets for presure resistance almost always spawns in tons just a few hundred meters below the starting depth tolerance. This forced me to restart a game more times then i can count.\n\nAnother isuee is  the day and night mecanic. In minecraft it was a chalange becouse monsters could find you. Under the sea  though  predators(Sharks are the only mob that atacks on sight) find you in about 30 seconds after nightfall,\n\nThe only thing to do is to jump yourself al the way back to your base,(No running mecanic is present and walking is limited becouse of the legendary invisible walls). And it seems inside it even a nuke couldent hit.\nNPC's just circle it blainlesly. It looks nice, but after 10 minutes of night with a moran shark doing 360's around your house you just get sick of it. The only thing capable of killing during the night is death from starvation.\n","November 13, 2014","false","13.9"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","0"

The art design, the music, the crafting system all work to create a tranquil gaming experience.  The storyline is basic - survive, repair and return - you decide how/when/where to do that.  There are a variety of aquatic life forms - both flora and fauna - to delight the eye and add to immersion; but insufficient to encourage re-playability without the player's own ingenuity.   The cooking/farming and crafting are entertaining, but expanding those skills falls short of really essential.  That all being said - its a game I return to time and time again, and still thoroughly enjoy!\n\nThere are mysteries to unravel - decisions to be made, and not just the ones mandated by the story mode.  Nuances of the environment(s) to explore.  The game is more than just "find the pieces", but we (the player) have to make it so; being able to mod it would go a LONG way toward extending re-playability. As a single person team, it would also go a long way toward removing the governors from this project allowing this game to truly do the genre justice!   There is SUCH awesome potential laying fallow here for a phenomenal game!\n\nWould I recommend it?  Yes, with a disclaimer.  Its beautiful, entertaining, marginally challenging but requires a lot of player innovation to prolong the fun.  If you take your time there IS a pearl in this oyster, albeit a small one at the moment.  Here's hoping it grows...","November 24, 2014","true","36.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like to explore and I like combat, and I had fun playing it.  I usually only build what is useful and necessary in sandbox games, so the simplicity of the bases and equipment was not a negative for me.\nI most enjoyed Survival mode, available upon completion of the initial Adventure mode.  The increased difficulty of Survival mode made the game quite challenging and required careful resource management decisions.  It was most satisfying to earn my way back up to the top of the food chain.\nSurvival Advice:  At your first opportunity, make two underwater scooters to alternate between.  Move extractors around.  One can always open the inventory screen and heal at leisure, so carry ample food and bandages.  Predators only attack when there is blood in the water (or at night), so hunt with caution or while carrying serious firepower.  Enough harpoon cannons around your base can tranform threats into food.  There is no easier target to hit than one heading directly at you.","February 9, 2015","true","55.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The reason is the unique setting: surving and building a camp under water? Yes, please! :D\n\nThe first couple of hours are both the most interesting and the most frustrating. There's no handholding in this game. Figuring out how to build, repair, keep your hunger in check and gather resources are all up to you. Frustrating, but not EXACTLY in a bad way. After finally figuring out I had to first craft a knife so I could hunt fish, I felt like a bad ♥♥♥ not dying of hunger, and even more after finding out how that cooker worked to lower the hunger percentage even MORE. So more tutorials certainly could improve this game, but it didn't hinder me that much.\n\nWhat did hinder me, though, was that after the initial surface of the game, there were no advanced techniques. Once you've learned how to basically survive, explore, expand and repair your base, you're pretty much done. And that's a pity. There is a huge amount of potential for much more than what actually is in this game. Since this is a one man's job, I can't really expect AAA-like polish and finesse, but even then...it has more going for it than there currently is (droid control, sleeping mechanics, food preservation, advanced base customization, ...).\n\nHowever, I need to stress that while not playing as a critic, I certainly had fun. It's nice to explore, see what you can find and scavenge the bottom of the sea in search of resources. It has great immersion and the setting is (as I said in the beginning of this review) unique. Kind of sad the developer stopped adding things, but I wouldn't say it's an unfinished product.","January 27, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is not a super-serious game, but it gives you the under-water aquatic life style feel you want.\n\nThe music for the game is lovely, I'd buy the soundtrack if I had money to spare for it.\n\nThe idea of the campaign is to find 9 pieces of your missing submarine, while expanding your aquatic underwater base to survive and gather equipment.\n\nHunt fish for food, but be wary as sharks and other predators will smell the blood and attack you.\n\nThere are 3 levels of depth in the game, which you can easily clear if you mine the ores and create the necessary equipment.  Which becomes very redundant in the sandbox mode which at most can entertain you for a good 16 hours.\n\nI do reccomend this game as I bought it on sale for $4.99, but I would not reccomend paying the full price of the game as others have mentioned it is not worth the $15 full price.","January 5, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are a bit chunky and aren't anything to write home about, but they get the point across without feeling cluttered and there are lots of pretty sea creatures and seascapes to look at.\n\nAt the same time, the constant pressure of the depleting air tank, Nathan the Diving Man's stomach, and all of the pretty sea creature who want to murder the heck out of you keep the game from being a walk in the park.\n\nThis is not a long game, nor is it a particularly difficult one. Taking even basic precautions should keep you from getting eaten and skilled survivor gamers will probably be able to beat both Adventure AND the more difficult Survivor mode in just a few hours.

Each part a certain mix of thrilling and scary as you find out how to survive in each one. Which mostly consists of "How to get food here" and "How much time left before my air runs out and I drown." The only aspect the game is lacking is a bit more content, since I managed to beat it in 4 hours with no really huge desire to make a much larger base using the in game mechanics. Though, it does let you make something neat and elaborate if you come from a Minecraft creation-loving background.

I got instantly addicted and im NOT a huge minecraft fan. This game has an alure all its own.\n\nGraphics are great for the large scale of the underwater world. Extreamly immersive. Game play is very smooth and responsive, even on highest gfx setting (I5/GTX650ti). Game play mechanics are great, i have yet to get stuck anywhere on the map, unable to reach objects or get into a situation i need to reload a save point. Evolution is not super complex, you can't advance most your gear or buildings more then 3x levels if that makes sense but like i said, its very well developed so everything works graphically and mechanically.\n\nFew things - Minor anoying stuff that doesn't really detract from the actual gameplay; Resolution doesn't stick after setting it. Must be reset each restart. I have yet to figure how to split stacks in the game but not everything in the game is overtly obvious like most games that force you to sit through a boring tutorial. For the most part everything is straight forward, they figure you're smart enough to read mini descriptions and test and interact with your enviroment. No autosave, manual and requires you to quit to main menu each time(but resets daylight and fish/predator locations).\n\nHad i purchased this for 25+ bucks, id probably not be so happy but i would still play it out in an addictive manor. Considering the quality and content id say the 14 dollar price tag is exactly what its worth and is an excellent game for its genre.

The reason is the unique setting: surving and building a camp under water? Yes, please! :D\n\nThe first couple of hours are both the most interesting and the most frustrating. There's no handholding in this game. Figuring out how to build, repair, keep your hunger in check and gather resources are all up to you. Frustrating, but not EXACTLY in a bad way. After finally figuring out I had to first craft a knife so I could hunt fish, I felt like a bad ♥♥♥ not dying of hunger, and even more after finding out how that cooker worked to lower the hunger percentage even MORE. So more tutorials certainly could improve this game, but it didn't hinder me that much.\n\nWhat did hinder me, though, was that after the initial surface of the game, there were no advanced techniques. Once you've learned how to basically survive, explore, expand and repair your base, you're pretty much done. And that's a pity. There is a huge amount of potential for much more than what actually is in this game. Since this is a one man's job, I can't really expect AAA-like polish and finesse, but even then...it has more going for it than there currently is (droid control, sleeping mechanics, food preservation, advanced base customization, ...).\n\nHowever, I need to stress that while not playing as a critic, I certainly had fun. It's nice to explore, see what you can find and scavenge the bottom of the sea in search of resources. It has great immersion and the setting is (as I said in the beginning of this review) unique. Kind of sad the developer stopped adding things, but I wouldn't say it's an unfinished product.","January 27, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got instantly addicted and im NOT a huge minecraft fan. This game has an alure all its own.\n\nGraphics are great for the large scale of the underwater world. Extreamly immersive. Game play is very smooth and responsive, even on highest gfx setting (I5/GTX650ti). Game play mechanics are great, i have yet to get stuck anywhere on the map, unable to reach objects or get into a situation i need to reload a save point. Evolution is not super complex, you can't advance most your gear or buildings more then 3x levels if that makes sense but like i said, its very well developed so everything works graphically and mechanically.\n\nFew things - Minor anoying stuff that doesn't really detract from the actual gameplay; Resolution doesn't stick after setting it. Must be reset each restart. I have yet to figure how to split stacks in the game but not everything in the game is overtly obvious like most games that force you to sit through a boring tutorial. For the most part everything is straight forward, they figure you're smart enough to read mini descriptions and test and interact with your enviroment. No autosave, manual and requires you to quit to main menu each time(but resets daylight and fish/predator locations).\n\nHad i purchased this for 25+ bucks, id probably not be so happy but i would still play it out in an addictive manor. Considering the quality and content id say the 14 dollar price tag is exactly what its worth and is an excellent game for its genre.

I sat down and played through it in 1 hour and 45 minutes. Definitly not worth $7.50, I would say a good price woukld be $3 to $5. That's all I have to say on this game. Waaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy to expensive for the amount of game you can play. There is a more hardcore mode (which I have not played yet) that you unlock after beating the normal mode but I still don't think that justifies the $15.
