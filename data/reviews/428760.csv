Think of it as a "clicker" game with movement and a tiny bit more skill/reflexes/strategy required (though you'll occasionally use your other hand also, to hit hot keys).\n\nHey, it's no great shakes, but it's certainly cute 'n' fun enough in small bursts, and a nice change of pace from all the more "serious" games out there.  Nothing wrong with the price, either, but if you're going to bring anything approximating expectations to the table, you may want to wait for a sale.\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10.","December 23, 2015","true","3.7"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","14","19","5","0"

I wanted to recommend it, but the negatives just outwayed the positives here.\n\nThe main positive is that it is very cheap to try out.  The main negative is that it becomes very tedious too quickly so that the fun of playing it doesn't last very long.\n\nThe game in concept is great; you play a  dinosaur hatched into the cruel, prehistoric, dog-eat-dog world and you must fight your way through hordes of aggressive dinos, beasts, bugs, and plants in order to survive.  This would be a perfectly satisfying theme in the classic hack-and-slash genre, however this is not a classic hack-and-slash game, it is a hack-and-slash-and-clicker hybrid.  And unfortunately the mechanics required to make a game of that genre work well just weren't implemented within this game.\n\nAs a clicker you must click every attack as fast as you can to take enemies down before they take you down.  As a hack-and-slasher you are swarmed by many monsters and must manuever yourself optimally on the playing field to tactically dole out damage while also avoiding as much damage as you can.  If you click on a monster you attack it, and if you click on the ground you move to that spot.  It is physically very strenuous, however, to click at the highest rate possible whilst also trying to click on the exact right spot on the screen.  It is made even more difficult when the monsters' hit boxes are clipped exceptionally close to their sprites, the tall bird with the skinny legs I almost always had problems hitting even if I was clicking very close to the leg or neck but not actually upon it. There are item upgrades to improve accuracy ever so slightly, but I found the starting hitboxes especially frustrating.\n\nI also found that my character tended to drift to the top of the screen while playing because as I attacked monsters I seemingly kept clicking the ground behind them if my cursor moved the slightest bit, which would caused my character to move rather than attack.  I think if movement was, perhaps, a key based action and the mouse was solely used for attack, that I would have had more control over my character.\n\nAnother rather annyoing aspect of game play is that your character moves very slowly on the playing field itself.  The object of each level is to kill monsters at the fastest rate possible, however you move so slowly around the screen that it interferes with your ability to attack and kill monsters quickly enough to earn the three-star rating of each level.  Also the enemies that have special attacks, like the ground worm which tunnels underneath your character, are almost impossible to avoid unless you happened to already be moving before the "incoming attack" indicator appears on the screen.  And while there are stat items to improve mobility, there isn't a very good chance that you will acquire one before having to repeat many levels over and over again.\n\nAlso, you would probably only be able to play this game in short intervals as there is no auto-attack offered with this game either.  Many clicker games have powerups or acquired items which allow for a set dps to be maintained after having played for a while allowing for short rests between frantic clicking, but I have not found any such feature available: no friends join you, no auto-dps skills you can activate on cooldown, no items to maintain damage while you aren't clicking.  If you want to play, you have to be clicking and to keep on clicking (unless you use a third-party auto clicker program, which I do not, as it defeats the point of playing the game to begin with) until you develope carpal tunnel syndrome.  Each level adds an additional 50 monsters to chew through, and I found even with a freshly rested wrist, that I simply didn't have the stamina to make it through the highest level waves.\n\nWhat else is needed to make a hack-and-slash monster slaughter more satisfing?   Skills and powerup items, of course.  As far as the skills go in the game there are four to unlock and each is associated with a hot-key.   They work well and don't have terrible cooldown times, and it is learning to use these skills at the right time which is crucial for making it through the higher levels.  These four skills enhance the game play well enough and are executed well in the game design.\n\nThe item system, however, leaves something to be desired.  One acquires items from hatching eggs inbetween levels, and the eggs are obtained by killing monsters during the levels.  Nothing wrong with that, except that there is only a 1 in 5 chance that the egg you break open will have anything inside.  If it does, it is a random item from any of the item categories: weapons, specific slotted armors, and cosmetics, which can boost stats and/or change the look of your character.  Now there is a finite number of items to obtain in the game, and I suppose this system was used so that players could feel like they acquired more items the more they played, but at the same time they wouldn't acquire all the items in the game right away.  The main problem with this is, people don't like the letdown of receiving nothing when they open an egg.  It would have been better to implement some kind of a currency system, like getting gold from the dud eggs, which could be used to purchase the cosmetic items, but also having a 1 in 5 chance of getting a stat item from every egg.  At least then people wouldn't be quite as disappointed after opening 15 eggs in a row that contained no item.\n\nTo sum up, this is kind of an experimental game genre, and I don't think, conceptually, it is a bad one.  However, all the necessary elements were not there to make this entry an enjoyable game.  With a few tweeks, I would probably change my rating, but at the very least, I rather hope the developers try to make another game of this type but consider what is really needed to make the genre work as a whole.","May 1","false","6.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","2"
