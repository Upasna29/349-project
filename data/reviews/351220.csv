"http://steamcommunity.com/id/foamed/recommended/351220/","foamed","Foamed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/foamed/","2283 products in account","As a huge roguelike nerd that has been thoroughly invested in the genre for over 20 years I sadly can't recommend Tower of Eglathia.\n\nIt feels like I'm playing one of those games that came on the CD's with 250 free shareware games back in the mid 90s. The game is buggy, lacks certain features and the game engine itself feels clunky and archaic.\n\nHere are some examples of what stood out to me:\n\nWhen you open up any screen in the game (be it character info, inventory, checking the settings, reading a scroll and so on) the game opens up a totally new game window. All screens in the game opens up a new window.\nYou can't turn sound effects or music off (you can however lower the volume but you'll still be able to barely hear the game which can be annoying)\nBelow average quality sound effects.The sound effects become tiresome to listen to as they repeat constantly, there's very little variation.\nButtons can't be remapped.\nThere are no resolution/video settings except for turning fullscreen on/off.\nThe text font is tiny and you sadly can't increase the font size. People with bad eye sight will have huge problems reading the in-game text.\nYou can't turn off the tutorial messages and they pop up during every new game. The in-game achievements and its notifications can also not be turned off.\nSome tooltips are so long that they leave the screen, making it impossible to read the whole text.\nThere's also a FMV introduction video with the developer cosplaying as a character within the game. I personally don't mind it (even though it's cheesy), but it's without a doubt something that will turn a lot of people off. The introduction video can't be turned off and will play every single time you start a new game. It's possible to skip the video though.\nSpelling errors.\n\nSimply put: There are a lot of really weird game and engine design choices that just makes the game a lot worse then what it could've been. In its current state I simply can't recommend the game even though it's pretty cheap as there are far better roguelikes out there that are also free (Games like: DCSS, ToME v4, Brogue, DoomRL, ADOM, Cataclysm:DDA, NetHack, Angband, Sil, Infra Arcana, UnReal World etc.).","April 6, 2015","false","3.7"," 55 of 64 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","55","64","4","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wuffell/recommended/351220/","wuffell","Wuffell","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wuffell/","955 products in account","I've played a decent number of hours and characters now, so I can say that the game is enjoyable until the end. I've only tried easy mode so far, and that was enough of a challenge for a starting player.\n\nOverall, this game has a good feeling and it's enjoyable, but it's not a polished game at this stage.\n\nThe game dev has been very responsive to comments and has fixed a number of issues, improving the game a lot. Thanks!\n\n\nPROS\n+ It has a very good roguelike feeling to it\n+ Enjoyable\n+ So far the difficulty has been about right\n+ The atmosphere is pretty good\n+ Good sound effects; basic but effective\n+ It's cheap\n\n\nCONS\n- The interface of this game is pretty bad. Options open in separate windows. The map is pretty darn bad and should really open in a larger window. There's no quick sell in shops that I can figure out.\n- The video I have seen was very amateurish. Kinda keeping in theme though. The voice acting is less bad, but keeps cutting out like the music does.\n- The music hardly ever plays, but it's good when it does.\n- Can't truly customise keys, though there are skill buttons you can program\n- You can do a melee attack using the arrow keys, but it seems you can't do a ranged attack using keys so you've gotta use the mouse for that. Usally a game like this would let you push a key to enter ranged mode. It feels really awkward using qweadzxc with the mouse to aim, but it does still work okay. Okay, after playing a while, I found you can right click on an skill slot at the bottom and bind the ranged attack to it, but then you can only attack in the 8 main directions. Better than nothing I suppose.\n- There's sometimes a delay for about a second after attacking or using a special move. This seems to mainly occur after alt-tabbing from another program.\n- There's several spelling mistakes, but nothing too major that I've seen\n\n\nOBSERVATIONS\n- I would recommend trying the warrior first, as the first few levels are easy with the tough guy.\n- If you run into trouble with the caster type, try again but choose a different skill. Improving the starting skill didn't seem to be effective enough, but taking the Skapens skill worked a treat.","April 6, 2015","true","22.0"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","16","21","0","24"

The greatest attraction of this game for me is it's SIMPLICITY. Tales of Maj'Eyal which I loved as well, is a bit too complicated, so it is such a breath of fresh air for me to play this game because I almost don't have to think much :). I love it.\n\nThe only thing that is really missing in this game is the Steam Achievements. This game does have in-game achievments, but unfortunately it is character-based, and not persistant throughout the account. Achievements is like the wonderful icing that is missing from this very simple and fun game!!!\n\nHopefully the developer can consider implementing achievements.","April 16, 2015","true","95.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","4"

The developer has clearly put a lot of time and thought into this, as well as the tutorials and the overall story.\n- Lots of character and equipment options\n- Nice background music\n- Game is very changing, especially on higher difficulties\n- Tons of different monsters and levels\n\nCons:\n- The game uses standard windows forms controls which look very out of place for a game\n- The bestiary is really, really slow to load, especially as you kill more and more monsters\n- I'd like to see an auto save in case I accidentally quit the game or it crashes\n- Having a contact / feedback link more visible on the main menu would be nice\n- Please add shift click to sell fast in the stores\n\nGreat job overall!","April 10, 2015","true","6.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

(My channel, if you are curious, is https://www.youtube.com/user/williamroeben   I do primarily Let's Plays on damned near anything that most people don't do :)\n\nI myself... don't recommend the game in it's current form- BUT! IF the dev keeps working on it as promised, there IS a lot of hope and promise in it! Keep your eyes on this game, follow it, and buy it when it gets a little better. *I* bought it, of course :) , but then I buy ANYTHING :)","April 22, 2015","false","0.8"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"
