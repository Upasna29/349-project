If you are looking forward to playing co-op, please don't buy it yet.\n\nCurrently Nom Nom Galaxy (NNG) has input lag when you play in co-op. Everyone, even the host, experiences this input lag. It can range anywhere from 200 ms - 500 ms (rough estimate) depending on the connection. So if I press a button, it takes 200-500 ms for the action to happen on screen. This does not happen in single player, and when all players leave a hosted game, the host goes back to single player speed. This input lag is noticeable and gets very annoying overtime as it makes you miss jumps, and makes building your factory a laggy experience. The developer Q-Games has stated that this is currently the case because they have had a rough time with netcode, as the way they do it for PS4 doesn't work here on PC.\n\nHere is the discussion thread: http://steamcommunity.com/app/226100/discussions/0/541906348050084830/\n\nThe developer had every opportunity to delay this game, and fix this massive issue before launch, but chose to release it in it's current, annoying to play in co-op, state. This is unacceptable Q-Games. So I will continue to warn people not to buy your game until you decide to fix this issue.","August 4, 2015","false","13.7"," 333 of 447 people (74%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","74","333","447","9","36"

I love the polish, the style, and theme. The mechanics are solid and fun.\n\nI saw it compared to things like Terraria and Starbound, and while that isn't incorrect, it's not quite right either. This isn't a sandbox  game. At the time of this review, there are "levels" and a finite play time.\n\nThe game is broken down into days with the goal to get 100% of the market from your competitor (which as far as I can tell, is just a virtual system selling soup rather than a physical entity playing in your map). For instance, there is no enemy building a base and harvesting resources.\n\nWhen the day is over, you are transported back to your base to start again, some of the monster spawns and resources will have changed. I couldn't tell if it was randomly generated or based on some kind of ecology.\n\nAfter completing the mission the game does allow you to go back to your mission and "continue to play" however, you can only play one day at a time because once the day is over, it quits you out because you already have 100% of the market share.\n\nI'm not sure where they plan on going with this, if it's a linear experience or if they do plan to add more sandbox elements in it like the other games in the genre.\n\nFrom what I played I enjoyed every bit of it, but am a little let down on the fact it isn't an open ended, indefinite game type. Maybe that's my own failings for not doing enough research, but I would love to see the polish, art, and mechanics of Nom Nom Galaxy to have a sandbox mode.\n\nAt this time, it's realyl well done, but there isn't enough content to warrant the sticker price, so for that reason I cannot recommend the game. Hopefuly when more mechanics are added, levels, or what have you, I can reverse my position.","May 31, 2014","false","4.8"," 125 of 166 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","125","166","2","5"

With the company's latest game Nom Nom Galaxy landing on  Steam – it's time to find out what the chefs in Kyoto have cooked up with their take on the sandbox genre.\nAs a new Astroworker for SoupCo, you'll be helping the company corner the galaxy's soup market by keeping ravenous aliens supplied with a steady supply of delicious broth. Like the soup that you'll be producing, the game has a number of ingredients thrown into the mix that make for a tasty experience. Starting with a sandbox stock, the firm's added a dollop of base building, a dash of resource management, a smidgen of tower defence, and finally topped it off with a generous seasoning of both online and offline co-op.\nThe main mode that'll introduce you to the game's mechanics is 'corporate conquest' which sees your Astroworker sent to a variety of worlds to gather ingredients, make soup, and blast it into space to your waiting customers. Each planet that you arrive on is presented as a side-on cross-section, and you'll guide your Astroworker across some marvellously rendered 2D cartoon landscapes, burrowing into the ground to collect blue matter and ingredients that you'll use to build your base or make soup respectively.\nTo begin with, you'll have a limited number of structures that you can build, but even with this relatively modest selection, actually getting to grips with what works and what doesn't from a layout perspective takes a little time. Despite a couple of tutorial levels – which feel more like information dumps than teaching tools – you'll need to try and fail a couple of times to get to grips with certain gameplay nuances.\nThe sense of accomplishment when you build a smooth running facility gets even stronger as you unlock more and more toys to use, and whereas in the early stages you'll have been harvesting and delivering all of the ingredients to your soup machines personally, you'll start to introduce robots and conveyor belts to take a lot of the menial tasks out of your hands. That said, you can't rest on your laurels too much as you'll need to make sure that there's a steady flow of the right ingredients, while at the same time ramping up production so that you can deliver the soup to market faster than your competitors.\nAs you gather more and more market share, your business rivals won't take too kindly to you stealing their slice of the soup pie, and they'll do anything that they can to stop you from cornering the market. Consequently, you'll have to repel occasional attacks from their minions as they aim to destroy or disrupt your production plant.\nFortunately, there are a few defensive options in your bag of tricks that you can use to protect your base from these assaults. However, even with a few strategically placed sentry turrets, there'll be weak links that the invaders will worm their way through, so more often than not you'll have to get your hands dirty fighting them off yourself.\nWhile these skirmishes certainly keep you on your toes – and can really throw a spanner into your well planned works – they're by far the weakest part of the gameplay. There just isn't anything gratifying or impactful about any of the combat, and whether you're defending your base or trying to pacify some of the more aggressive ingredients for your soup, it all feels like a chore, only succeeding in making you itch to get back to selling your concoctions.\nThankfully, once you've completed any of the conquest stages, you can replay them either from scratch or with your constructed facility fully intact via the S.O.O.P Simulator, which has all the fun of blasting broth into space without any pesky rivals trying to sabotage your efforts. Adding to the longevity of the game further are 'galactic challenges' which refresh every few days, and let you compete asynchronously with other players in a variety of events ranging from races to sales challenges.\nNom Nom Galaxy has an odd premise that's been blended into a surprisingly interesting sandbox experience. While some of the gameplay ingredients don't necessarily work that well together – with the combat in particular leaving a bitter aftertaste – you'll at least be able to cleanse your palate with another draft of its fun base building and resource management, and that'll keep you coming back for more servings.","August 4, 2015","true","17.8"," 53 of 67 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","53","67","2","0"

It incorporates several different mechanics into a very different and more directed experience. The game is focused around your base, a soup factory. You expand it by building modules; soup making machines, rockets to send the soup off to other planets and get paid, and turrets to defend the operation. In addition to the structural aspect you can also set up a network of robot laborers and conveyor belts to aid in distributing ingredients and soups throughout your factory, I haven't gotten to far into this aspect yet but it is something I'm looking forward to figuring out. You go out into the world and bring back ingredients, combining two of them into a soup. You can farm plants in oxygenated areas of the planet, however most of the planet is devoid of oxygen and you will slowly suffocate there.  Playtime is divided into days, at the end of each day your profits for the day are displayed to you, you are given the opportunity to unlock certain upgrades, and then a new day begins starting you back at your base.\n\nAt this stage in early access I don't think there is a ton of content.\n\nAlso the game is lacking online multiplayer.\n\nHowever it does have splitscreen 2 player co-op, which is a major plus.\n\nOverall I would say this is a game to watch, and well worth picking up at the discounted price. The base building, day breakdown, and soup selling have the game feeling fresh and it shouldn't be mistaken as just another terraria type game. While it isn't perfect in it's execution of all these different mechanics it has a lot to build on and is quite fun as it is.","September 3, 2014","true","5.3"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","30","31","0","0"

With maybe a touch of Dwarf Fortress. And good, overall. To begin with, you build a base, run around collecting ingredients, and ship them off (in the form of soup) to hungry aliens. Then, you want to expand the level of automation, because collecting every ingredient by hand is rather slow... but automation is a tricky business. So, you work at balancing the need to keep pouring out soup with the desire to automate just the easiest parts of the process first... and then develop from there.\nSome parts of the implementation still feel a little rough around the edges, but I really enjoy the concept, and it's even better if you have a like-minded friend to play couch co-op with.

It's quite a bit more arcady then other games in those genres, with a constant threat of losing the market of soup, you must go out, find ingredients, make soup and ship it off, eventually just doing it by manpower alone becomes too slow, so purchasing aids is in order until the entire game turns into a soup making factory. You could think of it as having a slight Tekkit feel to it, maybe even as far as a... simple Tekkit Terraria.\n\nThe graphics have a nice textured feel to them, it's certainly one of the better looking games in its genre, with colorful characters and plenty to gawk at.\n\nThe controls feel nice, although the character can feel a tad slow at times, the tank is even slower but well... it's a tank. I found that not all was explained to me too clearly however, but it doesn't take long to figure out yourself.\n\nGameplay's addictive, typical Pixeljunk stuff, I find all their games are really fun, this is no exception.\n\nI bought this in Early Access and as of now there's little content, no saves, bugged keyboard and mouse support and a few bugs, but I'd say this has a lot of potential and I'm looking forward to more.\n\nEdit: Keyboard and mouse support has been added, saves are in, more content has been added and it's slowly realizing its potential, I could cry manly tears I'm that proud.","March 13, 2014","true","2.2"," 50 of 70 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","50","70","0","6"

Can a feature be implemented when it's full on the next day? Would remove some of the hassle from wasting potential ingredients on a start of a new day just to get their health back to full.\n\n-Implementing a way for Charlie and Charles to use those floating elevators? They seem to be stuck to the platform they travel back and forth on\n\n-On that note, perhaps a system that allows the the player to take the current ingredient out of their hands or swapping it with another ingredient, e.g., if they're running back and forth with a ingredient that can't be used for a soup dispenser yet because that soup dispenser is waiitng for another ingredient.\n\n\nBugs\n\n-I'm not sure if it's a bug but sometimes after planting mushrooms or other plants of any sort, they dissappear after a few days, is this meant to happen? If not, then this needs looking at.\n\n-One instance when I was invaded, after a enemy died and a rocket turrent just fired a missle after it died, the missle image stayed uprght as it homed to the where the enemy disappeared.\n\n7/10\n\nRecommended Purchase.\n\nNeeds work to get it sparkling but what is there, is already solid.\n\nLooking forward to what else they have planned.","March 15, 2014","true","5.9"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","25","31","0","2"

Though it isn't very big Nom Nom Galaxy offers intuitive gameplay, a simple but enthralling story and PVP unlike any I've ever seen.\n\nIn this game your goal is simple. Collect Ingredients, Make Soup, Send It Home, ??????????, Profit, Simple. But there in lies the intricacy, the game offers the player a chance to build soup EMPIRES by competeing in PVP on every world. Players best time gaining control of the soup market (measured in days) is saved to a leaderboard on each of the Planets. Players pick the Company they want to compete with and a "Ghost" mechanism, much like in racing games, battles you for control of the soup market.\n\nThat seems a bit dumb? Thats what your telling yourself, I thought so myself when I read about the game to, but its not. This isn't like "Cook, Serve, Delicious" There is more to the gameplay then that. In order to become a Soup GOD, you first need to establish a base. This is accomplished by building an office, a soup making plant, and a soup rocket (sends soup home, is not powered by soup... I think). This base can be incresed in size using hallways and more soup infrastructure, it can be made more efficient via conveyor belts and robotic workers, AND it can be defended by Turrets.\n\nWhy do I need to defend my soup base? Because with all trade markets there are crooks who want to bring down their opponents. So your rival in the game, a soup company ALL players are competeing against, will send waves of enemies in an attempt to destroy your office, Without the office, your base cannot produce soup, so protect it at all costs. This can be done with the turrets mentioned above as well as with weapons and tech unlocked in a semi-RPG item tree shown at the end of each work day.\n\nFINALLY: Just as there is gameplay for builders, fighters, and managers, there is also gameplay for miners. One of the elements is digging DEEP into the planets your based on to collect delicious ingredients and Matter to increase the size of your base. Players will need to be warry though, for the only source of air below the surface is pockets of air, so when digging deep mind your distance to a pocket of air, or die a horrible death.\n\nIn closing: I think this game will be amazing when it hits full release. Though there are a few issues like not a lot of creatures and a limited amount of planets, there is no doubt in my mind that if this game is a success, we could easily see a Nom Nom Universe.","August 13, 2014","true","0.9"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

This is a very fun and unique game, my main critique probably being that the gameplay can get rather repetitive after a while, though it is still in early access.\n\nIn your overall efforts to dominate the space soup market you must build up your base of operations with factories to make soup and ships to send it out. There are many other things you can add, such as robots for assistance, but factories and ships are the main things you will be needing.\n\nFor positives, the game is really fun and is a concept that seems very unique. The multiplayer capabilities certainly add to this game as my friend and I had a very good time ensuring that Apache Teeth would be the dominant soup company in the galaxy.\n\nWhile fun the gameplay feels a bit repetitive after a while. I feel this game would greatly benefit from adding some more variety to the game. Perhaps make base defenses a bigger deal or make it so that you can raise your own army of robots to attack the enemy as they do to you. Also, the planets could feel a bit more different from each other.\n\nOverall, I definitely enjoyed my time with Nom Nom Galaxy and look forward to where it will go in the future.","March 12, 2015","true","9.3"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

I'm a fan of factory games, 2D survival, and platformers- this should have been right up my alley. However, the entire game is a bunch of good ideas that are executed amazingly poorly.\n\nOn the plus side, the art is quite nice. The backgrounds are richly detailed and animation quality, while choppy at times, is consistent and pleasing. The music is nice and never feels annoying or repetitive during the time I played. Presentation is good across the board.\n\nThe mechanics are where the game breaks down. There's too many to list here, but I'd say almost every single aspect of this game is executed to a lackluster, and possibly even lazy, degree.\n\n> You can build robots and conveyer belts to automate your factory- buut you never will because the robots are slow and idiotic, requiring mass numbers in order to even attempt efficiency.\n> You can discover interesting new combinations of ingredients- buut just creating as many variations on the most common ones is far easier and more efficient than scouring the map for anything rare and non-renewable. (Not to mention that more valuable soup doesn't seem to affect much: mass numbers seem way better).\n> You can construct a tank to help collect masses of ingredients- buut it's ridiculously expensive, slow, and only slightly faster than doing it yourself.\n> You can use special power-up gums to improve your abilities- buut you likely won't because their effects are temporary and not very useful (other than negating fall damage or loss of oxygen).\n> You get attacked by rival factions, necessitating defence- buut their pathing is so bad that by setting your base underground and walling everything off with blocks, they'll never be able to get at you.

There's some fun to be had here, definitely. I have 9 hours on record right now and I don't regret trying this out, but I do feel disappointed. The slow grind to get upgrades, the terribly implemented mechanics, and just the reptetition that sets in really can't save this game.\n\nIt's a series of good ideas, executed poorly.

Unfortunately, the formerly merely unhelpful second tutorial level is now just... gone. On the plus side, it means that you won't be stuck trying to win a level while struggling to figure out a bunch of mechanics with what was probably a gimped toolset. On the downside, you're now dropped into the game proper with no explanation whatsoever of the mechanics of farms, conveyors, robot workers, vehicles, half the facility's components, or how and where to start setting up from scratch. I'm just hoping that level was removed pending a more thorough set of tutorials.\n\nBesides that the aesthetic is alright although as of yet a bit rough around the edges, controls are mostly okay but awkward on ladders or when trying to punch something without destroying terrain, the game runs at the size of a postage stamp when windowed, and pitches a massive fit when switching to fullscreen.\n\nI feel like I'd enjoy the hell out of it if I could figure out what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on but I'm having a devil of a time getting that far.

Its a sandbox Terraria-like game.\n\nYou own a space-soup-making company, and you must travel around building soup factories and exploring planets to find ingredients to make new receipes and keep your market share high. To do this, you explore planets in a 2d environment, build a soup-making base with modular parts and "matter" you dig out of the ground. You are going to need soup refineries, soup rockets to send your new creations to market, and even defenses to protect your base against invading rivals, Therss also both local and net co op and multiplayer, a free build mode, a "conquerer" mode, something like 100 soup receipes you can make and even more I havent found yet.\n\nWait, what??\n\nYeah, just bear with me here.

You'll be doing this all while competing with your rival soup company, who will send evil henchman to destroy your precious factory that is entirely customizable by you. Building up your defenses is a must, and while your little character can potentially fight off the hordes of enemies it does certainly make things easier when you're helped by turret-like structures that you built. If a player is expecting to go into this defending it on their own, they're going to have a hard time.\n\nA lot of Nom Nom Galaxy's appeal is that building your factory and building a strong infrastructure is important. This includes defenses rather than thinking you'll be able to solo a legion of explosive ships with just your fist and buzz saw. You aren't getting attacked all the time, but there is an indication in the upper right hand corner of your screen that lets you know that the attack is coming, how far ahead you are of the rival companies profits and gives you time to prepare. It's a well-executed system, giving the players just enough time to prepare, and not too much time to sit idly by waiting for the invaders to come. If the player is too far away from their home base while harvesting new soup ingredients it can lead to disaster, so careful planning is a must in order to get through the game's “day to day” grind. That's a big part of the appeal of this game is that you can build everything up in such a way where everything works succinctly and perfectly with one another. For you to make a nearly flawless system that will help make you daily tasks easier and for those who really like well-made systems like this, such as assembly lines, this might appeal to those sensibilities.\n\nFull Review[www.noobfeed.com]","August 28, 2015","true","4.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

These are the diggings of the Starship NomNom. Its never ending mission: To eat strange new vegetables, to seek out new creatures and eat them, to boldly devour all that comes before it!\n\nThis game is full of potential and already packs quite a punch in delivering fun. Tasked by your overlords to explore the galaxy and find new worlds on which you'll create massive factories devoted to the glorious task of producing soup. You'll encounter creatures and vegetables and more that you'll shove into cans and send off into space. The goal of each world(stage) is to beat out the competition and win over 100% market share.\n\nThe time really pushes the pace of the game. Gameplay is broken up into days and getting as much accomplished as you each day is the key to victory. There is no out lasting the opponent. The longer you take the more and more resources of the planet you're consuming which can make finding enough resources to secure a large push to win very hard.\n\nThe gameplay is a mashup of a few different styles. Theres exploration, building, tower defense, and business simulation just to name a few.\n\nThere's a few rough edges to the game. I mentioned before that taking too long to get to victory can actually make the game much harder. There comes a point where you might have to abandon a map you've been working on for some time simply due to resources becoming too rare to make it feasible. There's also the fact that time doesn't stop when you enter the building menu which can make planning your base much harder as time is very valuable and can't be wasted. This can lead to mistakes in your building planning that you'll have to overcome. The combat is straight forward, but lacks any real punch or variety(at least in the early stages I've seen). There's enemy ships that show up that you must deploy buildings to help defeat and monsters(weird vegetable creatures) that you defeat to gain ingredients, both are straight forward and haven't offered any challenge as of yet.\n\nHowever, despite the rough edges I find myself playing more and more like it's a drug.\n","June 23, 2015","true","11.5"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","10","16","4","0"

It's something new, some kind of Terraria, mixed with a automization game like Factorio. It's super cool and the design is raw, but overall pretty complex. The possibilitys are almost endless and every new planet got a new, hard mission to get over! After every planet you got a new technology which would help you to get your next base even better than the old one! I'm thrilled to see how it will be in the end!\n\nBUT there are some things that really made me... sick, kinda.\n\n1) My movementspeed and jump speed is nothing like the videos. I ran around with about 30% of the speed shown in the videos. Also climbing and exploring was super ♥♥♥♥♥♥, so you basicly placed your base where you landed and took everything you got there and planted your own garden aside.\nThe buggy thing around that was, that after I ALT-TABBED out of the game and went back, all movements were on 200%. I kindo ran around like a leopard on steroids. Weird, need to get fixed.\n\n2) Exploring was not possible. First, the movement i mentioned above. Sedond: Your low air limit. After landing, you had about 5 minutes to find a place either to build your base or, if you were lucky, you found air. Air was pretty rare on most of the planets I was on, so i HAD to build my base, or I let myself simply die to respawn with less gold and stuff.\n\n3) I was stuck on a mission (on Ordsok, you have limited rockets to get your soup out). I destroyed 2 rockets by accident and had the problem, that I didn't get out of 70%, since the enemy always shot his rockets to keep me there and my soups only gave me +5%. So i started running around and colecting all new things to get new recipes. I got over 15 new ones over the time and, in the end, I won.\nSuddenly a message was shown, that I "achieved everything in the Early-Access and got every technology avaible" (remember, I was on the second planet of the second universe, I had like another 8 missions to go through). I was stunned, but sad, because I loved to look out for every new planet to get new stuff. And now I have everything and the fun to play the game and achieve more things really stopped, I don't even want to play the game anymore, the story mode was all that kept me here (because of the problems above).\n\nPS: It does show, that the game has 32 achievements. But neither can i see them nor did i laready got one. Is it blocked because of the Early Access? Or do I have another issue (I use the german steam layout).","June 27, 2015","true","12.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

It's a platformer mixed with a real-time economic component, and it's incredibly engaging. The basic setup is that you run around a 2D world harvesting ingredients from plants and animals (kind of like Terraria), and turn those ingredients into soup, which you then fire off into space in rockets to try to out-compete other companies. The ingredients have their own ecological relationships, too - some animals attack you or eat plants, the resources all spawn and reproduce differently, some are hazardous and others provide you and plants with oxygen, and so on.\n\nMost of my time was spent rushing around a level, digging and harvesting resources, desperately trying to out-produce my competitors while keeping in mind resource ecologies and market trends, and it was a blast. Tinkering with your factory, trying to figure out how to invest your money and resources and time in order to get the optimal return on your soup business, is something that easily devoured several hours at a time if I wasn't paying attention. Most games felt like I was struggling to compete at first, only for victory to sneak into reach so I could pounce on it. Good times!\n\nThere are really only two bad things I could say about this game. First, a few of the controls are kind of weird and poorly explained - it took me way too long to realise that where my mouse was relative to my character controlled which direction my character threw or deposited objects in. Also, whenever I placed objects my character punched or swung their sword, meaning I often accidentally punched or chopped ingredients or my own robots or equipment. Yeah.\n\nSecond, most levels decide to throw combat events at you. Your "competitors" will throw goons at your base, forcing you to spend money on defenses and rush to fight instead of harvesting. That entire part of the game felt superfluous and unenjoyable; it detracts from the skills you're practising in the main game and draws thing out, and all for what? The combat isn't very fun at all, in no small part because the controls just aren't as snappy and crisp as they need to be for combat.\n\nBesides those, though, the aesthetics and core gameplay of Nom Nom Galaxy were enough to pull me in for hours at a time. If Dota and LoL are RTS offshoots without infrastructure or resource exploitation, then Nom Nom Galaxy an RTS offshoot without much combat. It's great fun, and I want more games in this genre!","January 27","true","31.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's cool to try new recipies and see how the market reacts.\nConsOnline multiplayer apparently doesn't work. I can't try it because nobody plays. That's a shame, because that's one of the things that attracted me to the game when I saw the trailer.\nEvery 5-10 mins or so "night falls", resulting in the statistics for the day. You then continue to play the next day. First of all, this happens way too fast, but also all resources that were not picked up during the day despawn. That ties into the next point...\nThe game is all about automation, but the AI doesn't work too well. There is a robot for planting and a robot for harvesting ingredients, but more often than not one of them fails to do their job properly (they just idle around), leaving resources on the floor. This doesn't only ruin the whole "automation" aspect, but the resources also despawn like mentioned in the previous point. This unfortunately completely breaks the flow of the game. This is a point that's been discussed in various forum posts and also attempts were made to fix this, but it seems to be in vain.","January 3","true","12.2"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Each time you land (well, crash) on a planet, you have to set up a factory and take over 100% of the market. Each planet’s landscape is different and each planet is home to a different set of flora and fauna which you can use as ingredients. If the planet’s surface isn’t adequate for your factory plans, you can terraform it by cutting through the softer grassy cubes with your trusty handheld buzz saw. You will also need to mine for resources which are necessary to start building your factory. A certain type of resource buried in the ground will also provide you with pieces of gum which are basically temporary power ups. They range from being able to cut through rocks to running faster. You build your factory piece by piece in any way you see fit. You can either adapt the planet to your factory or adapt your factory to the planet. It is important that all pieces are connected to your base or generators which power the factory thanks to big yellow golden crystals. As your factory gets larger, it will consume more power.\n\nOnce you set up the basic parts of your factory such as the base, soup plant and rockets, you will need to explore the planet in order to find ingredients for your soup. Depending on the planet, there will be different plants and creatures in the vicinity. Running around and simply harvesting plants won’t work for very long as you will sooner or later use up all nearby resources and trekking along vast distances takes up valuable time which will cause you to lose market share. Just like in the real world, the best way is to industrialize the whole process. Designate a gardening area, pick a few plants and get to farming. Waiting for a plant to grow to its maximum will yield more ingredients. It gets a bit tricky if you choose to deal with creatures. They will fight back if you attack them and some will attack without provocation. Considering that you’re pretty weak at the beginning, dealing with creatures is simply too time consuming to be a viable strategy until later on. As you harvest plants or kill creatures and gain ingredients from them, you can mix and match all of these to produce various types of soups. There are over a hundred different recipes and some are worth more than others which brings us to another resource at your disposal – gold.\n\nAs you start building your factory and shipping your soup (via interplanetary rockets), you will start to earn gold. Gold is used to hire robot workers who will help you carry and ship soup, pass on ingredients to other workers, guard your factory and so on. You can also buy better weapons, namely a sword and a shotgun which are a substantial upgrade to your fists and the buzz saw when dealing with enemies and hostile creatures. However, the most crucial things you will spend your hard-earned gold on are defense towers. As you start taking over the market share, the rival corporation on each planet will underhandedly send their battle robots in an effort to shut down your operations. There are only several types of both enemies and towers, which means that this element of the game isn’t particularly involving. However, it does provide a nice amount of diversion from the factory business. You can also help out your towers and get straight into the fight. Once you hit 100% of the market share, you’ll be very close to completing the planet. All you have to do is maintain it until the end of the day.\n\nThe biggest issue I had with the game is the absolutely abysmal tutorial. It barely covers the essentials and it doesn’t really explain many elements of the game, even some extremely basic ones. For example, I knew that I could reload and repair my towers and the game prompted a button as maintenance. But that button led me to the store. I had to go online to learn that I needed to hold the button in order to open up the maintenance window. Most things you will need to learn on your own by playing the game through a lot of trial-and-error, especially early on. This could have been avoided by properly explaining the game to the players.\n\nApart from a fairly large campaign during which you will unlock all the workers, weapons and towers as well as discover loads of recipes, each planet you discover can also be played in sandbox mode. You can choose to start from scratch or continue with the factory you set up as you played through the campaign. Here you don’t have to worry about market share which basically means you can, if you are so inclined, build a vast factory and drain the entire planet of its resources, plants and wildlife. Each planet can be played in local or online co-op. There’s also a separate challenge mode which focuses on different elements of the game. Sometimes you’ll be tasked to go through an obstacle course in the fastest time possible or defend against a wave of enemies. You will be scored based on your performance and compared to other players via the leaderboards. This mode isn’t particularly compelling simply because none of the separate elements of Nom Nom Galaxy stand particularly well on their own. The jumping mechanics aren’t as tight and responsive as you want them to be, the tower defense element is rather rudimentary. It is precisely the synergy between all of these disparate elements that make Nom Nom Galaxy work so well. Building up your base, running around terraforming the planet and harvesting plants, dealing with wildlife, and then having to rush back to base when it is attacked to set up defenses and join the fight – all of these elements placed together create a dynamic environment that makes Nom Nom Galaxy so special and different.\n\nThe game uses a lovely, vibrant art style reminiscent of old-school 2D side-scrollers but with a more modern and unique touch. The soundtrack compliments the style of the game nicely, however, it is a bit repetitive and could have used more standout tracks.\n\nEven though the recipe for success in Nom Nom Galaxy is sometimes a bit too straightforward, this is still an insanely addictive game that I simply could not stop playing. A classic case of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts, Nom Nom Galaxy provides a charming, rewarding and emergent mix of action gameplay, business simulation and tower defense.\n\n8 OUT OF 10 (GREAT)","August 20, 2015","true","31.9"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

I can see the direction it is going in though.\n\n2D world - you start with a barebones base.  You deform/mine the area around you for INGREDIENTS and RESOURCE as well as to make space for expanding your base.  Mix INGREDIENTS to discover RECIPES of differing value.  Make a SOUP which must be loaded onto a rocket and launched, which generates MONEY.\n\nMeanwhile, a RIVAL corporation is doing the same thing, hostile CREATURES - which can also become INGREDIENTS - are popping around, and you need to shuffle ingredients back to base.\n\nYou can PLANT the things you find to FARM close to base.  You also can research BLDGS (like conveyor belts), ROBOTS (which can move stuff around for you), BUFFS, and WEAPONS.  You also have to worry about collapsing your base if you dig under it.\n\nI think it has a lot of potential, and overcomes the "What I Do?" problem that sandbox games sometimes have... this has a very clear goal and cycle, without bogging you down with "COLLECT AND ORGANIZE ALLLLLLLL THE CRAFTING INGREDIENTS"\n\nTooled about in the game for a while, then tried digging down just to explore... there are some interesting game mechanics to be found, and already several creatures of varying size.  Dirt falls, water flows, Tomato Plant pops out killer tomatoes at you, Giant Dino thing stomps you flat...\n\nOnce the tutorial and UI/controls become better explained (You have been warned) and fleshed out, it will be quite amazing.","March 14, 2014","true","6.1"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Its got a great base building mechanic and you can actually make conveyor belts and use aditional robots to actually make it pretty much automated when it comes to making more soup and sending it off for sale be careful though not everyones going to like the type of soup you make!\n\nNow it is an early access game constantly being updated and I've only played a few hours so far but Its definately worth a go and I look forward to seeing how it progresses.

The challeng is building in the right place, way ....so that you have a factory turning out soup so you can collect $$$ for reasons I haven't gotten far enough into the game to see realized.\nI just wanted to take down the original negative review because the game isn't clipping like it was.","December 27, 2014","true","2.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I suppose with a name like "Nom Nom Galaxy", I should have expected no less.  In this title, you'll be constructing a base and gathering resources with the intent on making soup and shipping it to hungry customers off-planet.  You'll also need to place towers around your base to fend off assaults from time to time, adding a bit of tower defense to the "Terraria-esque" gameplay.  Rather than face AI soup competitors, you'll be facing the imaginary ghosts of other players' previous saves.  I honestly would have preferred an AI setting that I could rely on (so that I could practice without fear of being slaughtered), though you can opt to play local co-op via split screen. Personally, I enjoyed my time with this title.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4wOR0x5e98\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJSu5FkdRmY","January 13, 2015","true","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Could be an update for the game or windows, could have been something weird with my PC. Either way, This pretty much changes my opinion quite a bit.\n\nSo if you don't already know, Nom Nom Galaxy is like one of those side scroller exploration crafting games.\nLet me put it this way: It's like one of those games if farming was the main focus of the game and crafting is only to make differnt soups so you know what is profitable to quickly earn cash and reach the end goal. 2 ingredients to make one soup and then send it away. Rinse and repeat.\nSo it's unlike any of the other ones. That alone gives this an edge.\n\nYou'll start out having to do this manually and explore the planet for ingredients. Eventually you'll have enough money to buy robots (which you unlock by completing planets). These robots are dumb. Really really dumb. But don't fret! Use ingenuity and you'll find these robots useful.\nOnce you unlock almost all of the robots, you'll be able make a factory that pretty much runs itself.\n\nBuilding the corridors and all of the machinery is super simple. All you need is one resource... which I'm not sure what to call. Let's call it blue stuff. You need blue stuff, which there is plenty of in the ground. Visible and all. Almost immediately after maybe a minute of gathering blue stuff, you'l have enough to build everything you need. It's extremely easy to get, so go crazy with the building. Just make sure you use supports. This time gravity applies.\n\nLike a tower defence game, sometimes you're going to be warned about incoming attacks.\nYou'll have to build towers to defend the factory from flying enemies and buy robots for ground enemies. Both towers and robots require a different resource: Cash.\nYou'll get cash from selling soup, killing enemies and daily salary.\nThe enemies will seek out and destroy your base. If they destroy your office, it's over.\nAt the beggining of the operation, you won't have enough cash to spend on enough towers, so you gotta use some old fashioned fisticuffs.\nI've seen some people here having an issue with the combat, and while they're usually right about it, I can't agree that it's a problem. It's very possible to defend yourself somewhat effectively, but it's very clear that it's not recommended. It should be last resort to go at enemies yourself. You can get weapons that are pretty effective too.\n\nAnyway... enough explaining the game, here's some criticism:\nMusic and sound effects could be more... energetic. The music basically sounds like something Boards of Canada would make on a rainy day (and I like some BoC). It's incredibly depressing and repetitive. Soundeffects are pretty lacking. It's hard to explain soundeffects, but all I can say is that they're few and very limp. There's no punch to any sounds. Not a huge complaint, I just appreciate satisfying sounds and lots of atmospheric flare to the sound design.\n\nSometimes, on certain planets, the enemies get stuck in weird places. They'll appear under the base stuck inside the ground or have trouble flying down to your base and be stuck in the sky.\nThis isn't that big of a problem most of the time, but it's god damn frustrating.\n\nWhen playing the game in split-screen in particular, when messages pop up in the lower right corner, and they're big too.\nThis means that half of the screen is now obscured by these repetitive messages. This also means that the player on the lower half on the screen can't see ♥♥♥♥.\nMaking them smaller or transparent would help a lot. But until then, good luck seeing anything player 2!\n\nThe game is way too easy. The game stays super easy throughout all of conquest mode.\n100% the market share everytime by making pretty much any soup and taking note of the current trend, which is as simple as reading a message that pops up at times in the lower right corner.\nI kinda wish it had more to it. More details to take note of and some more micro-management to make it a little more dynamic.\n\nClosing my little view on the game, all I gotta say is, it's great fun, especially in split-screen multiplayer (and probably online too).","August 16, 2015","true","34.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm assuming the game is remotely hosted (no LAN), based on the problems being encountered, but if not then there's really no excuse.\n\nFundamentally the multiplayer works, but suffers from numerous problems.

Neither of these problems are as bad as the third though.\n\nThe third problem is the desynchronisation between players.

My negative reveiw is subject to change, as and when full controller support is added as advertised, then ill update my review (looks like to the recommended), till then its a big no for false advertising. yes i know what early access is, i also know its not ok to lie about an early access game's selling points on a store front, imagine if a game said online multiplayer and it didnt have online multiplayer, any other game that is in that situation puts up a note in the description something along the lines of; "we plan to add online multiplayer in the near future" not advertising it as a feature. Had Nom Nom said 'partial controller support' or mentioned somewhere on the store front that controllers are a mess and will be fixed or that a k+m and a controller are required for local co-op it would be a different story.\n\nedit: i dont care how many fan boys i make cry, this is my oppinion; controller support is back in and so far working correctly, however, after playing for a while i simply couldnt care less if i play it again...ever, combined with bad advertising ethics and the constant bombardment on self praise in developer blogs i really cant recommend it. thats not to say its a bad game, just boring as all hell. may return but i doubt it\n\nedit 2: so strangely me and the house mate were looking for something to play together co-op and when she suggested nom nom i almost threw my controller at her head. reluctantly i agreed just so she could play for 5 minutes, realise how boring it is and we can all move on with our lives, we played for and hour and a half and laughed all the way, i didnt find myself liking the game any more, i didnt find myself hating the game anymore, i did however find myself wanting to come back and play it again co-op.... so take that for what ever it was but i thought for a game ive negativly reviewed i didnt half enjoy the time i spent with it. still sticking by my review but may have to revisit this sometime after ive played some more..... again\n\nedit 3: "lets make soup" is now code word for lets play something co-op, still not liking the game myself, but i have reluctantly changed my review to recommended for my fellow astroworker :@","December 8, 2014","true","12.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The connection is very stable, with no other games demonstrating problems. I'm assuming the game is remotely hosted (no LAN), based on the problems being encountered, but if not then there's really no excuse.\n\nFundamentally the multiplayer works, but suffers from numerous problems. It's laggy, up to a one second response time for input in some cases. Almost unpredictably the game will pause, process for a bit, then reload the level as if a day transition had occurred. Neither of these problems are as bad as the third though.\n\nThe third problem is the desynchronisation between players. You could be playing a different game and not know it, as there's no way to know if you're out of sync. I've played for an entire in-game day not knowing that the game on my screen was different to the game on my partner's screen. Very frustrating.\n\nIf you want this for multiplayer, don't buy it yet.

Gameplay wise its a mixture of Terraria style mining and gathering but instead of gathering resources to make better armor or weapons your collecting resources to make SOUP yep thats right Soup, After combining 2 ingredients in a factory you make a can of soup you send off in a spaceship to a planet to make a profit while at the same time competing with  rival soup company on the same planet.\nThe point of the game is to gain 100% market share of soup sales and to stop you every now and again a few enemys will appear which you can destroy yourself or make turrets to do the dirty work for you. Its got a great base building mechanic and you can actually make conveyor belts and use aditional robots to actually make it pretty much automated when it comes to making more soup and sending it off for sale be careful though not everyones going to like the type of soup you make!\n\nNow it is an early access game constantly being updated and I've only played a few hours so far but Its definately worth a go and I look forward to seeing how it progresses.

I tried to like it. I gave it a shot. It's just fighting me every step of the way.\n\nFirst, controls aren't really great. You dig with a huge buzzsaw that carves out wide areas. Great for tunneling, terrible for constructing a factory. Then you dug a little too far? Sorry, you can only jump two blocks. You can grab an edge to pull yourself up... sometimes. Unless you're holding a crystal. So alright, build some vertical shafts to climb up, but then you run into the building trouble: Zoom.\n\nThe game zooms in and out whenever it wants to and it doesn't stop zooming quick enough. So you can stop moving, pull up the build menu, pick a room type, rotate the room on the map, hover where you want it to go, and then click to place it. Oh no, right as you clicked to build it, the screen zoomed out more, moving where you were hovering the room, so now it's built somewhere else! Ok, let's erase the room and rebuild (eating the cost). Nope, that was now a load-bearing segment, so your entire base collapses. Reload an earlier save? That's not a thing, sorry. You lost the entire day's work.\n\nThen the actual game hits. Find ingredients (in limited quantities, farmable but very, very slowly) and shove them into soup machines. Then shove the finished soup into rockets. Get enough to have a monopoly at the end of a day to win the level and start over on another stage. There are robots that help carry some things either side-to-side (If you have perfectly level ground and don't mind waiting an ice age for them to walk) or throw things straight up (if you build the entire factory around that being helpful). Otherwise, you're on your own.\n\nConstantly getting stranded, or having ground collapse, or digging too much with a terrible buzz tool, or building and having it shift by a square... just so I can grind for soup ingredients for brainless robots to shove into the two machines until it tells me that I beat a level. Shallow, tedious, and plagued poor controls. And that's before the unexpectedly bad performance and laggy multiplayer.","October 9, 2015","false","5.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I bought it for 9 bucks and I'd say it's worth it. I would think twice about buying it for $20 at this early alpha stage. It is very enjoyable though. Definately an investment.\n\nI have some issues about the game. For example, you unlock items at the end of each day, then you have to buy those items with your money, and some of the items like Hoverboard and Pogostick only work when you aren't holding anything so then what's the point? You leave your base to collect stuff and you only come back to base when you hold something so then what's the point?

There's a fun little game in here somewhere. Others have detailed the odd controls, which can be negated with the ability to remap keys (not currently available), but I am more confused/upset with the fact that the game recognised my xbox 360 gamepad and registered it as Player 2. I started the main campaign game and the first non-tutorial mission loaded me into a splitscreen world. Confused, I moved my character with the controller, to see I'm P2. I'm able to then hit start and exit/back out, but then that leaves P1 on keyboard which others have already detailed how fun that can be.\n\nI picked this up during steam summer sale for a couple of bucks, and I certainly wouldn't recommend it for the 9.99 asking price. Even if the controller worked fine, I suspect I'd still be disappointed by what other reviewers have said about gameplay and feeling.

You start with only access to robots to move left/right and up/down, but no logic (only throw cans, throw 2:1 ratios)? Immediate turn off.

While we had a really good session on release, this game has been less stable since.  While playable - the game has network issues as well as a few problems with the way it handles multiplayer generally which kill it's long term appeal.  While these were to be fixed with a patch - that patch never came and I must correct my review to reflect that.  If they do fix these issues then I would heartily re-recommend this game.\n\nAfter starting a multiplayer game there is a period 'in time' where the render and netcode feels 'tight' and together across all the players.  After a short period it will appear to restart the game and  resyncronise.  We are now out of time with each other, the game plays in a slight slow motion and the rendered screen feels behind with the state of the game on the network.  So while at 60fps the effect is of being in a laggy slow motion.  This did not occur at release quite quite as it does now.\n\nNo real thought has been given to coop play.  If people join my game they do not gain the unlocks and progress that I get - this is just half finished.  The devs have said that this  would all be fixed in a patch months ago.\n\n\n********************** original review\nBought one copy to check the "lag even in local coop" - didn't have any so bought 3 copies to play with gf and brother.\n15 minutes later we are making soups together-  no problems whatsoever.\nMy machine i7 GTX970, brother AMD 965 with GTX670, gf (laptop) Core2Duo GTX650m.  No lag, no frame rate issues.\n\nI seem to be the one that likes to automate the corridors with robots and work out new soup recipes, find out which sell for the most, but also to keep the variety up (if you keep making the same soup you will lose market share eventually).  Meanwhile my brother is making security arrangements and building underground ingredient farms.  Meanwhile gf is off exploring and finding new ingredients - and better sources of existing ingredients.\nWe fell into it really naturally - I really think this is one of the best, truly co-operative games I've played in a while.  I doubt it'd be as much fun if I had to juggle ALL those roles - but playing with friends that each have a 'thing' they want to get into is wonderful.\n\nI started to give more and more direction to my team as I worked out what we needed from my soup research - and the guys really liked fulfilling those missions to find more cornbugs - or workout a better way to defend the conveyor belts so the soup doesn't backup.\n\nWe haven't unlocked anything much - but we played for hours - just exploring and (for me) mapping out all the different soup combos on the first map.  Can't wait to play more.\n\nThoroughly recommended","August 31, 2015","false","18.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My only complaint would be the tutorial isn't very good. It is actually set up into 2 parts so you can only get to the advanced tutorial by beating a couple planets. Really poor planning there...save feature is probably one of the best out there though. If you're looking for a change of pace this is the game for you it offers a little bit of everything.

The food network has nothing on us as culinary masters of our craft.  We set our standards high and above all the customer.  No matter how many eyes or tenicles they might have, each with their own favorite flavor, we shall reign in this fight for soup supremacy!\n\nThis game is fun in that it's a little collecting, base building and a slight dash of tower defense.  There is a tutorial that gives you an idea of what to do in game and how to win.  You are pitted against a rival soup kitchen and have to defeat them by sending huge cans of soup in a rocket.  Soup rockets will launch just by placing said soup in said rocket, there isn't any control over the rockets, which is a good thing in this game.  Your main objective is two fold. To discover new soups by combining new ingredients and giving the customers (who are on the other end of the rocket)  what they want.  You build your base by using a huge red circlular saw to break down everything even the ground to make room for your base.  You have a health bar and oxygen which you do run out of outside of your base.  The rival company who is trying to take your market share will send flying attacker aliens who all have different abilities and can seriously destroy your base and you loose the game.  There isn't a death penalty only that you drop some currency and best to go pick it up before the end of the work day.  Work days at what make the game a little more challenging in that a day lasts about 10-15 minutes and any ingredient that has been harvested that's on the ground will be lost.  To win the game is to have 100% market share by the end of the day to win.  Some levels we have gone 30 days before a had 100%.  Just sending any soup won't do.  The customer may not like that soup and for it you will loose 5% of the market. Or they may love it and you gain 10% market share.  I could go on and on but that's the game in a nut shell.  My wife and I really enjoy this game of soup making.\n","May 5","true","35.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
