Wants to be Persona so bad. Plot and characters are really disjointed. Like your main character is supposed to be some famous hero or something but starts at level one and needs to be talked down at / adventurer tutored by almost every important npc you meet. You can occassionally make choices that improve relationships with party members.\n\nThere are a lot of items. Most npcs in towns seem to be shop keepers and they will sell you bajillions of different items. It is really almost overwhelming. For instance, there is a store that will sell you a cure for each and every status ailment and a seperate store that will sell you a preventative for each and every status ailment. Same with single use / repeated spells.\n\nYou can, uh, walk through people.\n\nBut the game is strangely charming.  I think a big part of it is the graphical style. i like the bright primary colors. The world full of lush red pixel trees against green grassland and blue sea. The world building is interesting. I like that spellcasting is done with magic feathers and there are towns set up just to harvest and refine them. I like that farmers have trouble growing crops because adventurers call in all sorts of magic storms with adventurer items. Most of the towns are your regular fantasy rpg single purpose theme town. Mine Town, Farm Town, Pirate Town, etc. But they are taken to their logical and silly conclusions.\n\nOne of your party members is a weiner dog.\n\nYou can see random encounters as colored whorls and sidestep them.\n\nEveryone talks in the same grating nerd voice. The entire game is written in smug, eyerolling, self aware gamer style and it is like having your very own cheeto encrusted GM come to your house with sock puppets for a bunch NPCs and run a dungeons and dragons game for you, but not the kind you play now that you are a thirty-something-year-old-dead-inside burnout. The immature and imaginative and fanciful kind you played when you were ten.\n\nAnd for some reason, that is strangely endearing.","October 9, 2015","true","4.0"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","91","31","34","8","1"

I'd have to say the price is right, there's quite a few things that would normally be off-putting to me, but I just kind of rolled with it for the asking price.\n\nSome general feedback:\n- A world that I could explore was fun, that's what I spent most my time doing. I do wish that I was more rewarded for it - I discovered some firey shore area with tough baddies, waded through them all, died a few times due to random one-shot-fire-magic... collected a handy accessory on the way... then reached the end! ... which... had... nothing... Not a bigger baddie, not a fancy treasure - nothing!\n- I didn't feel like I had anything to look forward to with Character Progression/Customization, gear upgrading just wasn't compelling enough for me\n- If you're going to do elemental strengths/weaknesses, ya gotta at least compare with Pokemon. I don't feel clever when I exploit it, and it doesn't create any interesting synergies in strategies or customization (For an alternative example of combat having interesting choices without arbitrary rock-paper-scissors relationships check out Celestian Tales: Old North)\n- Risk:Reward seems way off, I don't feel I benefit from putting myself out there\n\nThat said! I liked it quite a bit more than a lot of the offerings on steam - if this is a first go at a game I hope the learning experience was awesome and that I can look forward to what's next :)","October 10, 2015","true","2.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I decided I was finally ready. So I decided to make an RPG engine from scratch using all the abilities I had acquired. + Vertical Turn-based Battles with plenty of abilities / skills / items, you can even change the weather\n+ Surprisingly detailed environments with well crafted sprites\n+ Humorous light-hearted dialogue\n+ Player Chosen Dialogue choices that impact the dialogue, and also impacts how well your team does in battle.\n\n- The story is a bit vague at times, it constantly refers to previous things your character has done, and sometimes assumes you know the backstory. I found this odd because I believe this is the first Legena game...\n- The characters.... are they all dogs? Humanoid animals / monsters? Hard to tell, it's also hard to tell their gender. I thought Atesan was a girl before realizing he was gay.\n- Too much dialogue, expect a LOT of reading","December 10, 2015","true","0.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Can't fight the charm!\n-The soundtrack is delightful! I like keeping the game in window mode so I can appreciate the music.\n-I love the top-down perspective used in battles, not only is it refreshing but it's also giving me Lufia and Daikaijuu Monogatari vibes.\n-Being able to change the weather to meet my tactical needs or simply for the fun of it. Reminds me of what Zephyr Skies: The Winter Sage could have become if it wasn't a troll game.\n-Many colorful feathers to collect, many spells to customize your characters with. Extra points for having water, wind and earth magic.\n-You can tweak the difficulty as you wish and I find this a very considerate touch.\n-Feel free to walk right through people! Albeit not under tents.\n\nCons\n-The dialogue writings are not impressive and that's already made clear within my half-hour play. I wish there were more commas to split those long sentences up.\n-Characters are little more than cardboard cutouts and I find it difficult to sympathize with them.\n-No stats comparison when buying equipment. Need a patch.\n-The tile colors look somewhat scruffy as I prefer more vivid contrasts.\n\nSuggestions for sequels\n-Improve the writing. And the characters.\n-The menus could use some polishing.\n-A feather fusing system, perhaps? For example, you can combine a soaked feather with a gale feather to create a powerful spell, which will affect the weather as well.\n\nAll in all, I'm satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it to my fellow JRPG enthusiasts. This could very well be the start of another great series.","October 10, 2015","true","2.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","1"

It was easy at the begining, later knowing the mechanics really helped out~\nEnemies Lack a "level" reference, later it's not that important, but when i was looking for a better place to level... i usually got oneshoted.\nThere's not world map map (at least i didn't notice one XD), locations do get pinpointed in dialogues but i occasionaly didn't know where a place was.\nAccessories lack their description in shops (apart statuses preventing ones), not a big problem tou\n\n\nAfter finishing the game well:\n\nMusic was fabolous all game long!! Love those battle themes <3\nExtra Side-quests i found were EXTREMELY enjoyable, especially  The cave of valor. Finding a part of Atesan past in Tetiro's "future" was really unexpected, the necklace seemed a simple background item.\nCharacters were fine, i was happy they were of different races, just a bit of a bother... some of them seems to "settle down" their problems with too much ease in particular after each met the narrator, same with their opinion from time to time. But among them Atesan surely shine, i appreciated, and liked, the dedication to his story\nLeveling... doesn't seems to be very rewarding, equips are simply better at handling stats. Add abusing of all buffs (or *coff* Dragon Helm *coff*) + debuffs and you can easily wreak havoc among enemies. Still, Bosses took a lil of strategy to be beaten, especially last ones. Main cause of a character death were a conjuction of spell+weather or a KO skill.\nSecret items EVERYWHERE OMG, be it a city... be it a dungeon... those helped a lot at making the game easier and i screamed "CHRONO TRIGGER!" each time i found one :3 (only thing missing... the sound :P)\nAfter finishing the game you get some secret words which should unlock things, i'll surely replay it!\n\nAll in all, there'd be more things to say, but, if you're looking for a nice retro style game, this one is worth your money, they really put lots of effort and care in it and sadly, lately, you can only find this dedication in indie games...\n\nI'll eagerly wait for the next installment","March 24","true","22.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
