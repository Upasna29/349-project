It shares common ground with systems in the Ultima series and Final Fantasy Tactics (overhead grid tactics) along with wizardry style dungeon crawlers (Fixed party of 4 specific roles making a fighting unit).\n\nI emphasize this is a combat game because that really is what the game is: a COMBAT game! 80% of what you do is fight and kill enemies, the other 20% is a mix of exploring and gear/stat management with some light story sprinkled in to keep a cohesive experience.\n\nThe combat turn is free forming where your characters do any action in whatever order you wish. The characters don't have to complete all of their actions before selecting the next character, and there is no turn order. For example you have have a caster debuff a monster, have your fighter run up to it and smack it, then have the caster nuke a different monster, then retreat your fighter back to support your caster all in 1 turn.\n\nThe game is a slow burn and takes a couple hours to get off the ground.The combat can seem like a foot slog at times, especially in the beginning when your party is just starting and you don't have many options. It takes time for the game to open up. Most RPGs are also guilty of this, but it is worth mentioning that you wont be tearing through the enemy with ease right from the get go.\n\nThere will be tough situations and battles of attrition where you have combat waves of enemies or large engagements and heavy odds. Certain battles can last the better part of an hour. Some people may be off put by the battle length, but the game auto saves all the time so you can quit out and continue anytime (including midbattle) they also added an animation skip option to help quicken combat downtime.\n\nThe game is challenging but fair. Enemies aren't pushovers, the threat of dying from careless play or overextending is always there. Often you kill enemies fast, but if you are careless they will kill you fast. It's important to figure out a fighting style or general group strategy that suits you and then SPECIALIZE. The whole party is a UNIT, each individual fulfilling a specific role. Damage and healing are obvious but good crowd control, and positioning are more subtle and just as significant.These subtleties are important as you advance into episode 2 (20-30 hours) and beyond when the enemy AI behavior ramps up to where things like: tactical retreats, luring/pulling, stealth attacks, cursing, repositioning, and using terrain are paramount or you will die a lot.\n\nSpeaking of death, it is handled in a very intuitive way. There is no resurrection or revive mechanic. If any of your characters die, you are given the option to retry the turn (this rewinds the game back one turn so you can try again, or you can reset back to the beginning of the dungeon area before the engagement. This is handy to start the fight from scratch or leave the area to resupply. The only negative for death is a hit to your total learderboard score.\n\nThe game encourages you to explore every nook and cranny and to kill EVERYTHING you come across. Stealth basically boils down to a way of getting the first turn in combat (getting an edge on buff/debuffs and positioning) and getting high critical bonuses on sneak attacks.\n\nIn fact, the game is so combat focus that it is hard to avoid most fights. There is no "escaping combat" mechanic. This can be a problem if fights goes badly. In this situation it is usually best to try and salvage by a tactical retreat for a few turns and regroup, or to let yourself die and restart before the engagement.\n\nThe story and dialog adds purpose and life to the game without destroying the game pacing or getting in the way of the combat. Story and dialog are pretty well done. The highlight here is the interaction between your characters and their reactions to things in the world around them.There are some cliche things but nothing too grating. It uses some common themes like a post-apocalyptic world and Norse myths, but it has enough twists and different situations to keep things interesting. There are some critical choice paths to make throughout, but interactions are never meant to take away from the combat focus.\n\nThe UI is easy to understand and the battle system and descriptions are clear and well explained. But some things need improvement like: more general graphic and ui options, more keyboard shortcuts, more ways to sort equipment.Some of this just comes from its trappings as a mobile game first but they could definitely help.\nEdit: In an update the devs added mini status bar with buff and status effects are started adding tool tips which help a lot. Good job on them improving this.\n\nRebuffing between fights can sometimes be a chore due to certain buffs needing a specific formation to optimize the buff and apply to all party members at once.\nEdit: In a recent update this problem has be resolved Auto Buff! This basically refreshes all buffs on all party members with one button click, no more repositioning and having to individually cast every buff!\n\nHealth and Mana management is done mostly through camping at specific sites spread around the dungeons or consumable items (potions, scrolls, etc) There are some skills that can help this along, like a skill that lets you sacrifice mana of one character to refill another's sort of like a mana "battery." This system works well for the most part. If you do struggle sometimes its better to go back to the local town or camp to refill your HP and Mana for free instead of consuming a ton of potions. Being conservative and walking back and forth isn't instant and can slow the game's pacing down a lot at times. Something like a town portal or zone teleport for dungeons you have already explored would help with the downtime here. Edit: The devs added a fast movement option which does help with downtime.\n\nRaising your statistics and leveling up is handled in a traditional D&D sense where you raise an attribute like strength or constitution, then raise a martial mastery like a weapon or magic skill like blades or conjuration. Then allocate points to improve a specific active skill like "Crushing Blow," "Healing" or "Fireball." Theses skills often have the trend where as you increase them they get more potent but cost more, so you need to balance it. This isn't too difficult to figure out and you can sit on unspent points if you don't know what to pick, but it is important to not spread your talents too thin and to have a goal or strategy in mind. It takes some critical thinking and planning as it is possible to make a counter intuitive build. Edit:Thankfully the devs updated with a respec option!\n\nThe music ambiance isn't bad, but it lacks variety and needs more songs added to the score, sound effects could use a volume slider since you can only toggle on/off currently.This area really needs some attention and would help enhance the atmosphere and mood of the game dramatically. Dev updates are currently working on this.\n\nIn Summary:\nOverhead Tactical Grid Combat System\nExplore subterranean world in post-apocalyptic environment with fantasy and Norse influence.\nTraditional RPG stat and level progression\nPRO\nThe pull is the simple, fun, challenging combat, and shear amount of content offered, this game is LONG.\nThe difficulties and the various ways combat can play out helps give it even longer legs.\nThe setting and writing are interesting and not drab\nThe devs are very involved and receptive to the community, the game is always receiving updates and improvements\nCON\nUI can use some more improvement, it still evolving from its mobile game trappings\nMusic and sound lacks variety and needs more general options\nMinor tweaks to the the system like addressing escaping combat and fast travel.","November 15, 2014","true","336.1"," 116 of 122 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","116","122","2","6"

Surely a lot of effort has been put in it. Not a roguelike, as the graphic style could suggest, but a story-driven old-school RPG with lots of content. It's too early to give a proper review, so take it as a partial view. I'm sure the game will even get better as it progresses.\n\n\nPROS\n=====\n\nStory and Dialogues: the story can be described as a crossing between Avernum (subterranean world setting) and Baldur's Gate: a cataclysm has shattered the surface world and peoples seek shelter in the underworld, and at the same time the gods have become weaker, and some of the dark gods are plotting to gain power. Not totally original but the dialogues are of much better quality than in most cRPGs, and the background story and the world building are surprisingly robust for an indie title. The first episode is completely linear, but this changes in Episode 2.\n\n8/10\n\nCharacter design and development: absolutely amazing. There are eight characters, two for each base class, and you can bring one of each pair. Each of them has a set of specific talents (empowered attacks, curses, healing or attack spells, etc) that can be improved with levels (not every level you get a talent point). The characters are very well balanced and you'll find it hard to form your ideal party, because they can have a lot of synergies, and at high difficulty levels the game can become brutal and you cannot make mistakes if you go for an ironman run.\n\n10/10\n\nTurn-based tactical combat: based on action points (for actions) and extra movement points (from spells, gear), make battles much more interesting than in Avernum games. The AI isn't perfect though, probably, I found thatsome opponents stay behind instead of charging you with all of their forces. Also mechanics for traps are very well done, with different patterns you have to spot to avoid them or disarm them in time.\n\n7/10\n\nWorld size: the world is also pretty big, I don't know how long it would take to complete all quests but I guess around 100 hours. Replay value is also great because you'll be tempted to try different party compositions.\n\n7/10\n\n\nEVEN\n=====\n\nGraphics: animations are well done, and so graphics in general, but some basic cave tiles are a bit weird looking. Probably intentional because it makes traps harder to spot if you're not careful. They are serviceable anyway, and overall ok. (I made an alternate tileset if you want to check it out, may not be for all tastes but I play with it).\n\n6/10\n\nInterface: a bit rough and with a 'mobile port' feel sometimes, but it has been improved a lot with the last updates.\n\n6/10\n\nSound: The main musical score is very nice, the battle musics are a bit repetitive, but they have improved too with the latest updates. You can also find a music mod in the forums.\n\n6/10\n\n\nCONS\n=====\n\nGeneral pace of the game: a fast enemy turn option has been introduced and now battles are much faster than before (unfortunately fewer sound effects are played with this option). There is a rather insane amount of them, though, so be prepared. Still, I wish movement were as fast as in the high speed option, but with normal animation, so that I could hear sounds.\n\n5/10\n\nLevel Scaling: all enemies scale, more or less, with your heroes' level. If you gain a level, you can expect them already to be tougher. This puts me off a bit, I wish enemies had a consistent level based on the map you're in. Game difficulty is well balanced, anyway, if you can stand this behaviour.\n\n5/10\n\n\nOVERALL 8/10\n=============\n\nIf you like turn based RPGs and you can forgive the outdated graphics and some other minor issues, you can't go wrong with this one, just be ready for a very long run. Update after update, I can say this game stays confortably in the list of the best fantasy RPGs I've ever played. Yes, along with Baldur's Gate 1&2 or SSI GoldBox titles. Good dialogue, unmatched character development, great balance and unforgiving difficulty on Nightmare, that's what you'll get.","August 16, 2015","true","163.7"," 41 of 42 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","41","42","0","0"

This is glaringly a mobile port, without even trying to mask it—there's even sort of ads to purchase the game on iOS and Android.  Usually I don't have an issue with mobile ports, but I think the transition may have perhaps affected the controls.  The responsiveness of the commands is hit or miss, which is what really breaks this game for me.  I won't dog the art style as I saw many people do when this was in Greenlight, because it's much better than I could do.\n\nI'm surprised I'm the first negative reviewer, but I'm sure most players received the game for free from a Groupees bundle(as I did) and are just being grateful.  Most of the positive reviewers seem to have less than 30 minutes logged—take that how you will.

The tile system used is well-done, and the spell effects are pretty good for this grade of indie RPG.  However, the portraits are fairly crude in comparison.  Given the limitations of an indie dev, I can't really rag on this too much, but it's a little jarring to see nice effects and tilesets while the portraits look like they've been done in photoshop solely with a round brush.  I don't demand mindblowing graphics, but this is just something that I've always found kinda funny with a lot of indie RPGs.\n\nSound (3/5):  I have to admit, when I'm gaming casually I often turn off the sound effects and listen to an audiobook or something instead.  However, what I have heard from HoS is quite pleasing.  The opening theme is decent, the sound effects and ambiance are nice, and overall it's quite acceptable.\n\nInterface (1/5):  This is HoS' biggest stumbling block by far.  While HoS may have a compelling story and a decent advancement system, these are overshadowed by the fact that navigating the game is a clunky, inefficient affair.  Two main examples stand out:\nFirst, movement.  On the combat screen one must double-click to move a character.  This is a smart way to do things, preventing the player from making a wrong move due to an accidental misclick.  Yet outside of combat clicking once moves the character, while clicking a second time while the character is in transit cancels the move.  The difference means that right after combat when I've been double-clicking to get around, I must take a few seconds to re-train myself to NOT double-click once I'm heading back to town.  While this sounds like a mild annoyance, consider having to do this after each combat.\nIt gets worse, however.  Moving across a map is a sluggish affair in any game, and good design means streamlining this as much as possible.  For example, a Run option helps you zip around just a bit quicker.  Tales of Maj'Eyal takes this to a major extreme, where the player zooms around the map faster than the eye can follow.\nWith HoS however, a player must click a point around 7-8 spaces away, wait while the sprite trots to the spot, then click again to move another 7-8 spaces.  While the lag time between clicks is no more than two seconds, it adds up to a player pressing a button for an instant and being forced to wait, while remembering not to click again if you get impatient as this would halt the character.  In any good game, you want the player to interact as much as possible with the game itself, and in HoS movement is an exercise in absolute tedium as interaction occurs in sporadic instants, with forced waiting in between.\nWhy not have the movement operate as in, say, Baldur's Gate, and every other game of this like, where a second click moves you to that new position?  Or add WASD functionality that grants the player real-time control of movement?  Even if it's just moving a character, at the very least the player is INTERACTING.\nThe second major problem is the menu system, which smacks of recycled code.  This is particularly egregious when leveling your character:  each character must click through three independent screens to modify stats, skills, and talents, and each screen only allows three or four options to be displayed at a time.  This organization of the data is crude, as comparison between different items or skills must be done by scrolling up and down, limiting effective side-by-side analysis.\nDialogue uses the same menu system: in one instant the player is on the game map clicking on a store icon, and in the next the entire screen is obscured by dialogue options (again, showing only three or four at a time).  The player is thus dragged back and forth between talking portraits and a full-screen list of options.  Not only does this break game immersion, it's again impossible to think over the options carefully and weigh your choices.\nAt best the menu interface is just inelegant.  At worst it hinders the player's ability to weigh his choices well.  While the designers had good intentions by wanting to offer a good quantity of information for each choice, the fact that this data forces us to analyze so few options at a time (and in sequence no less) utterly eliminates this minor advantage.  This is by far the worst interface I've seen in an RPG.\n\nStory (2/5):  HoS may have decent story going for it, but it unveils this poorly.  The trope of four prisoners banding together to break out is a good starter, but at the same time we are offered very little lore about the world.  I don't know anything about the enemy or the protagonists at the outset, so I feel no awe, trepidation, or empathy in the first few hours of play.\nConsider this:  A solid novel grabs the reader and immerses him in its world by the first chapter, hopefully with the first paragraph.  It quickly introduces enough details about the world and the characters within it that the reader gets a good frame of reference to how things work and what the characters are like.  The intro inspires him to keep going.  A game must be able to do the same thing.\nWe get a bit of solid interaction between the four protagonists in the prison, and hints of their personalities bubble to the surface.  It then takes perhaps half an hour to an hour of play to escape the compound they've been trapped in.  It is at this point that some more character and worldbuilding would be appropriate.\nInstead, the characters must slog through a maze of tunnels to reach the first town.  That not only means a LOT of tedious navigation (as mentioned earlier), but it blocks any opportunities for motives, personalities, culture, or history to be revealed.  It's only after a couple more hours of combat that we get some small cutscene where the characters are chatting in an inn and their quirks and goals rise to the surface.\nThere's definitely a world to explore and people to come to love.  However, there's too long of a fuse and very little payoff that I've seen after four hours of play.\n\nGameplay (2/5):  HoS is moderately fun, past the interface.  The combats are decently scripted, and the system is straightforward.  The four class choices are the standard fantasy tropes of warrior, wizard, cleric, and thief.  These tropes are fine, yet not nearly enough work is invested in making these classes novel or interesting.  Each class has only about ten or so unique talents:  some of which unfortunately make others redundant (giving wizards the ability to unlock doors and disarm traps has ALWAYS robbed thieves of their unique utility).  Frankly, even the high-level talents aren't anything to write home about, and so it's very hard to get excited about leveling up.\n\nOverall (2/5):  I decided to review HoS not because I had a particularly good or bad experience.  Rather, I decided to take my time reviewing this because I see genuine potential in the indie dev's work.  Unfortunately, not enough care was given to the logistics of gameplay, the appeal of the setting, or the fun factor of the system.  I bought this game hoping for a tactical RPG experience that would grab me, but was ultimately disappointed with clunky controls, an uninspiring class system, and insufficient development to tell me "Hey this game promises a great experience.  PLAY ME!"\nWith so many indie games coming out and so little time in one's life to play them all, a game has to grab a player immediately with the promise that the time investment is worth it, and operate smoothly enough to ensure that this promise is fulfilled quickly.  Unfortunately, HoS does neither of these.  Yet I do wish the Trese Brothers the best, and hope that they learn and grow from this experience.","July 19, 2014","false","6.2"," 59 of 82 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","59","82","0","0"

It's my opinion, not fact, but I really felt that WQ boardgame flavor when I played, and I can tell you it is a great feeling.\n\nHow can it be so?\nIt doesn't have random quests and although it seems to possibly have some random loot, Heroes of Steel has a real story to live, not a short theme for a quick mission.\n\nI believe it comes from its top view and tactical combat system, but also thanks to the danger the game puts your heroes through. In WQ mobile port, you do not feel the threat. In Heroes of Steel, you do - you feel hunted, you want to survive until the next safe spot, and you'll do your best to get to it.\n\n\nNow let's get deeper into this review.\n\nGood points are that:\nHeroes of Steel surprised me with quality tactical combat, interesting choices and great dialogues! Enough qualities to make you purchase it.\n\nRead below to know more about the weak spots in the game, but if you want to enjoy nice boardgame tactical combat, well written dialogues, and a nice "party roleplaying" aspect, you may go for it.\n\n\nThe dialogues are very well written and make us feel like on a serious tabletop RPG. There are nice reactions between teammaters and we know something more is to discover here. We want to see the next steps. The game also feels like having a great duration to it. I only got to the first town here and there surely are a lot more hours to put into the game.\n\nThe choices themselves, though sometimes limited between two paths to get through, are interesting enough; the game makes you feel the danger, threats can get really oppressive (I so much wanted to get out of the caverns!) and the camp spots make sure you are always on your guard as you'll always be lacking healing options. In an atmosphere like this, even picking a path is great, especially as taking the dangerous one also triggers nice dialogues (see above :) ) between your characters.\n\n\nAs for the tactics, some combats are really tough, but moreover,  the skill and AP system is very well implemented. With each character's progression you have to make some interesting decisions. After playing dozens of roguelikes and RPGs, I feel Heroes of Steel has a very nice system deserving to be at the top 10 of these games.\n\nThe art and UI were the two elements that really frustrated me at the beginning. The art is original but doesn't always have the "pro" touch. 2D indie games need great 2D art (at least a few pics of them) and here this is something that is a bit lacking. Some arts are "hit or miss". Still, the game is more than good enough to make you enjoy the rest. It's just an area that could have given me even more pleasure.\n\nThe UI especially made me uneasy. I wasn't used to it. I left first, but after coming back to the game and going through just a few fights, I began to like it more and now the UI is as good as the rest.\n\n\nI really think the strengths of the game are:\n- the quality of its writing and dialogue: a very good surprise here,\n- the quality of its combat system: even though there are sometimes LOTS of fights, it still stands as a very good system.\n- quality in character progression, I mean that with four characters to upgrade, most games fail here but this one still keeps interesting choices.\n- and a strong Warhammer Quest boardgame flavor!\n\n\nHeroes of Steel then ends as a very good indie RPG and a game to recommend.","February 19, 2015","true","7.2"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","22","24","2","1"

The story does have it's moments of cheese, but underneath the artwork and first-time PC dev interface is a game system that's been honed over years in table-top play.\n\nBasically from what I can gather on their forums, the devs have been world-building and playing out RPGs for decades and that really shows in the care and balance that goes into building out the game mechanics.  I've played more than a few RPGs that are beautiful visually and have a slick interface, but have zero thought going into skill advancement or how a squad can be built out.\n\nThe one thing I'd love people to realize about this game is that it's both long and evolving.  You can get a taste through the prologue of the game but the full flavors don't develop until you're well into it.  Also, this game has had 22 updates on Steam as of the writing of this review and there are more in the works.

The more I play this game, the more I am falling in love with it. Let me start first with telling you a bit about the battlesystem. As a Turn Based RPG fanatic, this battlesystem works great for me. You have 4 partymembers (for example Tank, Rogue, Wizard, Cleric), a turn based combat system with action points (like Jagged Alliance or Divine Divinity Original Sin) and some very enjoyable encounters to overcome. I started playing on hard and I think that's the right way to play this game.\n\nThere is a good story in this game, all characters in your party have their own 'goal' and I love reading their chats and thoughts. The skillsystem works great, each character has like 10 different skills to upgrade each level up (each skill has 10 levels to improve them) so for replayability that's a good thing, you can make very different party setups at start and through the game with the different skills.\n\nThe game graphics aren't 3D and it doesnt look like an AAA title but gameplay goes first for me and this game surely delivers in gameplay (specially when you reach the first town, the game really starts). I recommend watch some gameplay videos on youtube or here on Steam to see if it's to your liking or not.\n\nDevelopers keep on bringing new content for free, like new dungeons and weapons. So NO micro transactions for new content, just a free update from steam and it's in your game. Developers are also very active on the forum and will help wherever they can.\n\nNow it's time to continue with my game, I hope this was usefull for you.","March 4, 2015","true","27.0"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","0"

I'm so glad it's finally on Steam.  The PC version is great because you get the bigger screen, keyboard commands and quick keys, and easy zoom.  The game is otherwise the same as the mobile versions.  This is an enormous game which is not yet complete, and is constantly changing.  I keep telling myself I will play something else but everytime there is a new update (which is very frequent, sometimes 2 per week) I have to try out the changes.  There is one more character to be released, the Dueler, a warrior.  To briefly describe the game: it is a turn based RPG with the standard 4 characters of warrior, cleric, thief and magician.  The tactics part comes as you learn to fight the various monsters in this world and work on building your party with talents that complement and enhance each other.  You can spend months just trying different character builds to see how they work and which characters they work best with.  The replayability is incredible.  Don't think you'll become bored by seeing the same maps over and over.  The updates I mentioned often come with new bosses, new secret doors, new sidequests, new areas . . . as I mentioned before the game is constantly changing.  You can play at several difficulty levels from easy to nightmare (for those gluttons for punishment).  I know that other reviews will tell about the storyline plus you can read the description from the developers, so I won't go into that except to say that it is complex and very interesting.  Heroes of Steel provides you so much value for your money. It is larger than many games I have bought at two or three times the price and will keep you entertained far longer.\nThis review has gotten too long, I need to go back to the game!\n\nIf you want to see a tutorial to learn more about gameplay go to:  http://www.indiegameguides.com/Heroes-of-Steel/tutorial","April 23, 2014","true","319.2"," 40 of 58 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","40","58","0","1"

A rpg which harkens back to tabletop gaming ala Dungeons And Dragons oozing savory cooking juices of stats, attributes and skills defining each character with very unique traits, strengths and weaknesses. The replay value with Heroes of Steel RPG is endless with the ability to create new parties different from the one you had in your previous group and seeing how they fare against the rules and mechanics of the game world.\n\nYou can equip many weapons and armors on your characters depending on their class while others are off limits once again dependent on class. Do not fear though whether warrior, archer, cleric, mage you will have a fearsome arsenal to do battle against the blood thirsty merciless villains and disgusting vile repugnent monsters you cross paths with.\n\nMagic comes in extremely useful in Heroes of Steel RPG. So if your a lover of magic users you will be very satisfied as you cast combat and defensive buffs upon yourself and your fellow adventurers along with healing to keep your party fighting against overwhelming odds while utterly destroying your malignent murderous foes with offensive spells.\n\nEverything is done from a top down view with nicely detailed graphics which give off a very comfortable to the senses board game feel. Though animations are not really there its enough to convey a feeling of magical life as if game pieces had eerily come to life to amuse, befuddle and terrify you as you suddenly feel your mind pulled into all that is going before you.\n\nEnemies are pretty menacing and frightening. When encountering an orc for the first time in the early parts of the game i actually found myself intimidated due to the excellent build up through gameplay pacing and the story playing out in descriptive text boxes as enemies spoke. I dont think an orc has ever creeped me out as it has in this rpg and there are plenty of other encounters with different beings and monsters just as unnerving.\n\nCombat is turned based yet with a very smooth feel where its like real time. You can take as fast or slow as you want between each turn deciding what is the best strategy. Environment is also very important as it can make a difference in spending your time mainly healing or attacking then going behind safe cover as the enemy play their turn. Its quite a scary moment whenever your party is all of a sudden thrust into combat with dramatic music playing and a sense of life and death as they were discovered sneaking about in stealth mode picking locks and or exploring an area. Yes there are skills for picking locks and being stealthy. Rogues and thieves clap your hands in gleeful greed! Silently of course. Wouldnt want to draw any attention to yourselves now would you.\n\nOh and there will be blood. Plenty of blood. Just make sure its not yours.\n\nAudio could be a bit more detailed but it still captures a board game feel due to its simplicity adding to the retro rpg ambience of everything bringing home the tension and relaxing moments. Music is fantastic and me being a lover of 1970s and 80s b-movie i was in music nirvana as i felt that world to explore and discover rush from movie warriors of old such as ATOR THE IRON WARRIOR, DEATH STALKER and CONAN THE BARBARIAN.\n\nThe user interface is very busy and easy to get into with plenty of areas to check on your parties inventory, skills, equipped items, level up screen, appearance etc. Excellent ui which does not get in the way yet is highly indepth.\n\nHeroes of Steel RPG a rich attention grabbing story with excellent high quality combat and gameplay mechanics which any fan of Dungeons And Dragons and other classics such as Warhammer Quest should get their mitts on for a festive battle fest of flying flesh cutting steel and blazing buttocks searing magic!\n\n\n\n","April 21, 2015","true","3.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

This is an Android Port game, and I play it on my Samsung S4 regularly. (You’ll notice it doesn’t seem like I’ve played the game on STEAM. That’s because I haven’t. Not really.)\n\nIf you're a graphics addict, then this is probably not for you. On the other hand, if you can forgo graphics for the joy of story and gameplay, this might just hit the spot.\n\nWhen I first played HoS, it reminded me of a much better version of GURK II: retro, a party of 4, exploration, random monster encounters, loot, turn-based combat on a top-down view.\nSome details of the game:\n1.	Party of 4. You can choose alternate classes. (Basic is Warrior/Barbarian, Rogue/Archer, Wizard, Priest)\n2.	Party is permanent once the character members are chosen.\n3.	Turn-based combat.\n4.	Resembles a D&D board game.\n5.	Characters level up with experience.\n6.	Characters gain points to buy character stats, character skills, and/or character spells.\n7.	Character icons ARE NOT static. They actually fidget on the screen (This little detail I love. Adds a lot of realism)\n8.	Character portraits are static and are obvious amateur art, yet they are VERY detailed.\n9.	Equipment gives stats/skill bonuses/magic bonuses.\n10.	Equipment IS character specific. I like that. It adds a little extra hiccup to deal with. Spices things up.\n11.	Like Gauntlet, the game has Health Potions, Mana Potions and Health+Mana Potions.\n12.	An EXTREMELY long main quest. I kid you not. You’ll spend MANY HOURS exploring content without finding an end.\n13.	The game has more than a few side quests to explore. Up to you to do them or not.\n14.	This game has 4 full episodes and the final episode is finally out. The game is COMPLETE. Thus, there were hours of gameplay before the 4th episode, and now there are more.\n15.	The game pacing was vastly improved by increasing the general speed the characters travel on the overworld (underworld?) map.\n16.	Nightmare mode difficulty setting. This is my favorite setting. It’s so dangerous, difficult, and plain challenging that I have to pay attention to everything: from money, to potions consumed, to where I put my stat points.\n17.	The interface has seen a lot of revamping to streamline it and make it easier to navigate. I, honestly, didn’t like the first version. Now I marvel at the changes that I never considered which improved the game considerably.\n\nNow. Added value to the game:\n1.	EXTREMELY responsive developers. I mean this. The developers answer questions directly and constantly communicate with the clients via their proboards Star Traders forum. These guys are so dedicated to making their games work that they don't stop updating. That's a LOT of value for your $$$.\n2.	The community is super helpful. I mean this one. It’s like a dream place, never seen anyone flamed or abused.\n\n\nSo, Yes I recommend this game.","June 16, 2015","true","0.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Gameplay is deeper the longer you play, and there are 4 difficulty levels, and an optional upgrade for 4 additional characters is available.  Replay value is high due to ability to mix and match characters.\n\nAccessible Developers and Community\n\nThe developers are very active with this game (all of their games actually), and continually upgrade, improve gameplay, squash bugs based on user feedback and advice.

Meaning once you select the characters and really get into figuring out a build for them, if you want to start over with a different character/mix of heroes, having to restart from the beginning is just dreadful for me to think of doing having invested so much play time to get to the same spot.  I make this comparison to other games like Shadowrun series, Wasteland 2, Blackguards series, XCom series, Temple of Elemental Evil, Expeditions Conquistador, Legends of Eisenwald.

The artwork is great, and the story is pretty good in an old-school RPG way. Combat is also good, and very similar in style to many tactical combat games. The UI could use some work...in particular, tooltips when hovering the mouse over things like talents would help a lot. The on-screen keyboard when naming your group should clearly go away since PCs have keyboards (unless it thinks I have a Steam/XBox controller?). It would be great if you could sync progress between the PC version and the mobile version (Steam Cloud for Android in the future maybe?). Overall, it's fun if you like tactical combat games and old-school RPGs. The devs are great and very responsive from what I've seen.

I don’t want to spend hours trying to find one.  Over many years you end up purchasing many games.  The real cost is how much of your free time you spent playing them.  RPG games have been around for decades and remain my first choice.  After so many years it isn’t easy to find an RPG that stands out from the crowd.  Why did I write this review?  Good reviews have saved me allot of time and frustration.  If you share what I value in a great RPG this review can save you some time.\n\nDecember 8th 2013 I have been playing Heroes of Steel almost daily since it was first released.\n\nFebruary 2014 Heroes of Steel became available for the PC before greenlighting on Steam and although I run it on multiple devices the PC version is the one I play exclusively unless traveling.\n\nApril 23rd 2014 Heroes of Steel goes live on Steam.  Why would I use Steam to play when I already own multiple copies?  Simple.  Very fast updates, cloud storage, trading cards, easy access to game documentation  and the Steam community.\n\nWhat’s in the box?  Heroes of Steel is composed of 4 episodes with 2 acts each.  There are four main characters that come with the game.  Outlander, Wizard, Cleric and Thief.  There are 4 IAP characters available which come bundled with the game at no extra charge. They are the Duelist (yet to be released), Paladin, Sorcerer and my favorite the Rogue.  Episode 1 and Episode 2 Act 1 are available to play immediately.  You get the rest of the Episodes at time of release.  You also get “Upgrades for life”.  A Trese Brothers gold standard.  Anytime a new quest, game area, new monsters, rules, graphics enhancements any change or bug fix is absolutely free and will appear on your next Steam update.  In my experience each episode feels long enough to be a standalone game. You may end up running several saved games at the same time, the character abilities and combinations are fascinating and well balanced.\n\nHow do you play it?  The game is set in the Underdeep driven by a complex story line.\nYou create a party of four to begin your journey into the Underdeep.  Each character has Attributes, Skills and Talents that are leveled as you would expect in an RPG. Heroes of Steel does it with a twist.\n\nFor a quick but somewhat outdated introduction to gameplay take a look at;\nhttp://www.indiegameguides.com/Heroes-of-Steel/tutorial\n\nTo play successfully  each character must use their talents to support the team.  It isn’t about choosing one character and using the rest of the team as standby support.  In addition different characters participate in some cutscenes tailor made for their role in the saga .\n\nWhy am I still playing?  When there are so many games available and so little free time.  The majority of games I’ve played are set in stone, with add ons or sequels for additional purchase. Heroes of Steel reinvents itself on a regular basis.  There have been over a dozen major updated versions with many more tweaks and fixes.  Everytime I think the game is mastered a new aspect is introduced to challenge me to play longer.  From my point of view when completed Heroes of Steel will never become stale and repetitive.  The Trese Brothers imagination and creativity never lets me down and always surprises  Having played RPG games since the 70’s I can honestly say Heroes of Steel is in my top 5.\nHave fun!.","April 26, 2014","true","036.3"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","0"

Everything about it is very well designed. The combat, the characters, their talents ( skills ), and the enemies and their AI.\nThe AI is something remarkable in this game. The progression of the enemy AI combined with your learning curve and character developement makes this game a real challenge. If you play on Easy or Normal you can enjoy the ride and have a great time fighting moderate fights ( in normal  it's still pretty hard in some parts ) , but if you like a good challenge, be sure to play on Brutal or Nightmare. This game will really test your strategy skills.\n\nI loooove this game so much. Even more than my beloved xbox vanilla Skyrim. I've never invested soo much free time thinking about builds and stuff.

Not to say there aren't other Gamers this would appeal to, but as I play, I keep feeling like it's 1996 again. Included in that nostalgia is the same solid combat, quirky controls, missing featues, and good storyline that you had to deal with 2 decades ago.\n\nPros: A good storyline. So many indie games have horrible dialogue and story. Not the case in Heroes of Steel!\nFun and constant combat. For a Turn Based RPG this game plays out more like an Action RPG. There's so much combat. It keeps the game interesting and exciting.\nClass customization. It's minimal, but provides enough depth to really make your team fit your play style.\nEpic scale. 8 hours in and I don't feel like I've gotten out of the start of the game!\nSolid TBS RPG gameplay. It works and it works well. They didn't reinvent the wheel and they didn't have to. Good job!Cons: Music - This is at the top of the con list because ... OMG ... I can't listen to an 8 second loop of the same battle tune non-stop for 8 hours!\nMissing game overlays. When you detect traps the game doesn't highlight them. For .6 seconds a message displays telling you, you've detected them. Now go find them! When you select a ranged attack there is no radius to display your strike range. You have to litterally check the range and count the tiles yourself.\nUI - It's minimal, but perhaps to a fault. You're missing access to some of the games menus and can only reach them via keyboard shortcuts.\nNo Saves. You just advance, no take backs or what ifs.\nNo edge scrolling. Why do I need to use my arrow keys to move my view around?\nSo that's my list! I have to say, I've put more hours into playing Heroes of Steel than I have for many of the main stream Turn Based RPG's out there right now. I think that says something. I really like the simplicity of your group, having 40 different companions with 200 skills each sounds cool, but in practice it over complicates things. Understanding the relationship between weather and elemental attacks, using terrain height, flanking attacks, special power bars, switching between live action and turn based, all these ideas have been designed and work well enough. But there's something appealing to just being able to sit down, play a game, and not have to worry about any of those things.\n\nLike I said, this is a game that lives in a world from 2 decades ago. It's simple yet solid. Fun and rewarding. It has a story that doesn't dissapoint (so far at least). I'm looking forward to more games from Trese Brothers!","February 20","true","9.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","3"

I was first introduced to RPG games by the Trese Brothers' mobile offerings, and it's amazing to see how far they've come. The artwork and music makes Heroes of Steel much more exciting, atmospheric and eerie than I had expected, and it far surpasses most full 3D games made by big companies. The talents system is my favourite feature, it’s incredibly intuitive and really lets you get into the game quickly. I also love the key bindings, mouse zoom and detailed artwork that make the game seem natural for the PC. Overall, a game so superb that it keeps me hooked, despite the fact that RPGs aren’t my favourite genre.","June 11, 2014","true","2.2"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

It has a lot of issues, that I hope will be fixed in the future. I haven't played all that far into it at this point, because it's very slow, and I'm hoping future updates fix the game. Edit: I'd like to say the developer is actively addressing many of the issues to make the game flow faster, and is listening to the players on the forum to streamline the game.\n\n1. The game is a port of a android game. A good port, but the controls are clunky and you'll find yourself clicking 2-3 times for something that should be one click. Add that up over thousands of times, and it slows the game down.\n2. Combat is slow. I'm hoping for an option to speed the game up at some point.\n3. Loot seems to be random, but it doesn't seem rewarding so far. You can go into a big battle that takes you 30 minutes and your team barely scrapes by, make it to the chests and find out you got nothing but potions and junk. I can't explain how frustrating it is to not have at least one good reward after opening 2-3 chests.\n4. Dialogue is clunky as well. The screen changes, then it goes into a series of text boxes, and if you want to talk to someone, you have to click on them again, then go back to the dialogue menu again.\n5. Basic things like sound and music are either on or off. These are *loud*. I play with both off, because I don't want to have to adjust my volue out of game every time I play, then adjust again when I'm done. There are just many basic things that you can't do, like remap keys, adjust volume, etc. These difficulties show the android app port limitations.\n\nAll in all, it's a good game though. If you are a fan of turn based, party-based games, you will most likely enjoy it.  As the developer works on player suggestions, it will only get better in the near future.","July 3, 2015","true","25.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

(From magic rings to armor sets)\n\n\nGranted the game might not be on the complexity level of Final Fantasy Tactics for depth, but it delivers a solid turn based tactical dungeon crawl that's well worth the price; and is a surprisingly long game for its size.

This game uses a more traditional strategy system instead - you move all of your character in any order you like, then the enemy, this makes the fights a lot more tactical and like a real wargame, you think of the whole team and not just one character.\n\nThe fights are interesting, the writing is suprisingly good, all in all I can recommend this game to all fans of turn-based combat!","May 3, 2014","true","2.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I've been playing, watching, enjoying, and learning about Trese Brothers games for well over 2 years. I list all four of those because they are all a part of the Trese Brothers experience. Everything they do is open and engaging. They don't just make games, they make beautiful communities of players, artists and writers on their forums.\nWith great respect to the old days, when a game was more substance and less flair, the Trese Brothers deliver a certain standard of quality in all of their releases that I find has been lacking by many standards. This isn't just "An Indie Game". Heroes of Steel is the first in a soon to be much larger collection of games crafted by developers with the same standards as the gamers, who hold themselves to a higher level of scrutiny than "How much many did we bring in?"\n\nOnce you've downloaded and installed Heroes of Steel, you will find a high quality, complete game worth every penny you spent, so you may be surprised when you start seeing new characters and large content additions continuouly throughout the games lifespan. Certainly, you'll be ready to purchase their new games once those become their project and the support ends for He... WHAT? what are you talking about? They keep supporting ALL of their projects. SOMEHOW (the amount of sleep they get is undetermined. probably because they're too busy making better games to measure it).\n\nI fully and strongly encourage you to get on board with both Trese Brothers' Heroes of Steel and the Trese Brothers community. Don't settle for low-quality games that get by on pretty explosions anymore!\n\nAnd also, grab the two pack. show a friend. spread the word.

Where do I begain, this is such an awesome game & an incredible experience. The Keymap was a nice addition showing you what keys on the keyboard you'll use. I also like that it can be a mouse only game, so I can play it on the computer that's hooked to the tv and then sit back on the couch with a wireless mouse and play it from there. I started an all new group, I've added Selen the Rogue & Fyona the Paladin (I've not played these characters yet on my Android game) along with one of my favorites Vincent the Sorcerer (played him a lot in my Android version) and of course Vraes the Outlander (from the default group). This game is highly entertaining and lots of fun. I also really like the fact that the right side of the screen was changed so it will scale to your screen size and allow you to see more talents at one time. Later in the game this will be very helpful. The Android version is locked a 3 talents but on my PC I get 6 of them displaying at once. To sum it all up, I love playing this game I have lots of fun and enjoy it a lot and that's the most important part in the end ! That I'm enjoying what I'm playing !!!! Highly Recommend !!\n\nUpdate: I have been using what is now my favorate group; Kincaid instead of Vraes (who I dearly loved) but Kincaid is sooo awesome and I love the throwing knives that he can use. So its Kincaid, Vincent, Fyona, Selen. This makes for a fantastic group for me, they fit together so well and can cover each other. I'm almost completely thru Episode 2 again and some area's where I had trouble getting thru before was much easier this time. I use Kincaid as my Main Tank, his job is Death & Destruction and being a Shield too if needed. He is my main point man. He has a 1-Handed Sword & the Throwing  Knives, Not everyone likes the knives but I love them and think they make a great secondary weapon, they are excellent for finishing off Monsters when you get them to 10 point left and run out of AP; knives have a range of 3 so you can kill off a Monster that next to a team mate without waitting until the next turn and giving the monster an extra turn to damage or kill you. I love knives as aweapon and enjoy using them as my second weapon but I've read on the forums that someone was using knives as the Main weapon for Kincaid.. Pretty Cool Idea. Fyona is my 2nd Tank and can stand toe-to-toe with Kincaid or if needed While Kincaid battles at the Front, Fyona can battle at the Rear. Fyona is also the Healer for the group using Blessed Aura, she uses Battlefield Devotion later on to get rid of curses which is helpful in Episode 2. Fyona uses a 1-Handed Hammer & a Shield to do her damage with. So both Kincaid & Fyona are Melee fighters. While Vincent & Selen are Ranged fighters to began with but as you move deeper in to the game they need to be able to do some Melee fighting too. Next is my buddy Vincent who is a Ranged fighter who uses Lightning Spear as his Main weapon which allows multiple targets to be hit each turn. He can also weaken & slow down enemies. This Vincent uses a Staff as his second weapon which he uses during Melee battle. He kills off what he can before they reach Kincaid & Fyona or as the Melee fighters battle the first line Vincent & Selen kill off any reenforcements. Last but not least is Selen, my thief, who's Main weapon is a Bow and she can be very deadly with it, using Pinning Shot she can also hit multiple targets, her second weapon is a light blade. She can also reveal the surrounding area so you can see whats coming or where you want to go. She has the useful thief skills of lock picking & trap disarming. So as I head to the end of Episode 2, and looking forward to the just released Episode 3.. I still Very Highly Recommend this incredibly deep and fascinating game with a interesting storyline that I enjoy watching unfold. The Most Important thing is the countless hours I've spent ENJOYING this remarkable game. Afterall that's why I play games... for the enjoyment of them !!!","April 25, 2014","true","356.9"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","1"

The soundtrack doesn't consist of many tracks, but is atmospheric and fits the theme of the game perfectly.\n\nThe main issue I have with this game that makes me give it a thumb down, is that I the fights are too repetitive and boring. Hordes of enemies keep attacking everywhere I go and all fights are identical to one another. I've won all battles so far using the same strategy too, there's no variery needed.\n\nAround an hour into the game, battles began to be nothing more than an annoying nuisance preventing me from exploring the areas and advancing the story.\n\nThe second big issue I have is that all areas I've discovered so far, are designed like mazes with enemies protecting each and every crossroad and dead end. It means that you have to spend 10-15 min each time you take a wrong turn to fight off the enemies just to discover it was all for nothing. Bummer. The enemies also never drop any loot, all you get is some exp for your trouble before backtracking the maze o where you came from.","May 18","false","10.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","7"

The interface is horrible, both in aesthetic and usability.  Simply levelling up your attributes presents you with a scrollable list of massive text - something that could easily be on one screen.  It's full of this kind of thing.  The entire levelling process could be on one screen, but it's split into three for touch screens.\n\nAnimation is basic to say the least, and the art style looks amatuerish as harsh as that sounds.  Environments are blurry when zoomed in.\n\nBarely any usability options that are expected of a PC game, including custom hotkeys that don't seem to support Shift key modifiers.  No gamepad support.\n\nYou are limited to four premade characters with what looked like a small amount of talents (not sure if more unlock later).\n\nThere is a massive lack of feedback for the player.  You've no idea if your characters are buffed for example without diving into their character status (which of course takes up the whole screen), and even then it won't list what buffs are on them -- just the affects of the buffs.  Maybe I am wrong about this -- I hope I just missed it. There is no combat log, so you're just left to guess what is going on unless you want to inspect and memorise each enemy's stats and yours and do the math in your head.  There is not even a basic % hit chance indicator when mousing over things.  Abilities that have a ranged component give no indication of that range that I could see, leaving you to constantly count tiles.  This lack of feedback and polish is everywhere.\n\nIt might be good as a mobile game, but there is just nothing compelling about it in the PC space.  Combine that with the poor usability and you get a dud IMO.\n\nTheir follow up game, Templar Battleforce, is FAR better.  Some of the usability concerns remain, but it's generally much slicker and has a much more unique theme  and structure which carried it through for me.  The theme in Heroes of Steel seems as generic as it gets.\n\nNote - I only played 90 minutes or so, just couldn't stand the shortfalls any longer to play more.  I hope the devs focus on PC sensibilities a lot more for their next PC release.","May 2","false","1.4"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

I'm a huge Trese Brothers fan. I've logged tons and tons of hours on this game, but it's all on my phone so I'll review the phone game here, and later when I get around to finishing my ongoing games on the phone and play on steam I'll try to update this.\n\nAnyways, this is definitely one of the old school style of games. What exactly does that mean? Well, it's pretty unforgiving, and at the higher difficulties it's pretty much impossible not to die. If you do, no big deal though! You can always replay your last turn or restore to the last resting point you used.\n\nWhat do you get for your $12? Well, as of May 16th, 2014 you get 7 characters (2 variants of rogue, mage, and cleric and a single varient of a fighter) as well as 2 "episodes" of content. What is coming down the pipeline? 1 extra variant of the fighter class as well as 2 more episodes of content.\n\nWhat exactly does all that mean? Each character has a totally different skill set, strengths, and strategies. For example, the two rogues play wildly different; one specializes in her bow and ranged battle while the other specializes in melee destruction. The two clerics are even more different, with one being a traditional support cleric and the other being a much more combat oriented paladin styled cleric. Each episode is made up of 2 main chapters, which are both long and challenging. I'll talk about the first episode so you can get an idea what I'm talking about. The first chapter of episode one sees you protecting a town from a Ratkin infestation and is a good solid 3-5 hours long. The second chapter of episode one finds your party undertaking a risky journey to a second village and running through a nest of lizard-men. This one lasts another 3-5 hours long. That means you can roughly expect the full 4 episodes (when they come) to last for about 12-15 hours for a single play through, and you'll want to do more than a single play through!\n\nNow, I'm sure people will knock the game for being a port of a mobile game, but that's really not a big deal. The brothers built the game with the idea of eventually bringing it to the PC, and there are keyboard hotkeys. Not only that, but the entire game can very easily be played with the mouse. The graphics are nothing special in the realm of PC games, but if you are looking for a really fun, deep tactical RPG then you really can't go wrong with this game. On top of everything I've already covered you need to know about the Trese Brother's work ethic. They have 5 games (currently) out for Android/iPhone, and are getting ready to release a 6th. They've updated those 5 games a total of 642 times, each time is either tweaking the game in some way, adding content, or both. They are amazingly receptive to their players, if you head over to their forums (or post in the community group here) they are more than happy to chat with you and will take anything you say into consideration. I've been a Trese Brother follower for 2+ years, and have seen them passionately work on their games the entire time.","May 17, 2014","true","0.4"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

The Trese Brothers have excellent customer service and has been very pleasant to communicate with. With that being said, I had a lot more fun playing it on my android phone than I did on the PC. It reminded me a lot about the turn-based RPGs I played while growing up. The setting actually is somewhat reminiscent of Dark Sun: Shattered Lands. Obviously being a mobile port, it is not as feature heavy. I think this is a great title for those that are new to turn-based RPGs to enter into the genre.

It seems to have a solid storyline with enough going on in the background to keep me curious.\n\nI have a few irritations with it, but they're just that, irritations. One is how it seems like moving everyone separately is the default formation. I don't like having to go out of my way to regroup everyone.\n\nAnother is the fog of war, it's generally fine but I've notice that when it comes to the diagnol space right after a corner, you have to be in the corner space to reveal it. Not a game breaking issue, and I know that I'm a bit obsessive compulsive when it comes to clearing away the fog of war, but it bothers me anyways.\n\nLastly, the distance sight ability of the rogue/thief feels a bit wonky when it comes to the color coded squares. Not sure how to fix that, if at all.\n\nedit: Played it for a while now and have a better grasp of the mechanics involved. In some ways the game is more forgiving than I realized, in others... not so much. Unless you know exactly what you are doing when it comes to the combat system, expect to die sooner or later.\n\nOtherwise, when it comes to blessings/buffs and curses/debuffs, they are your friend and will make combat easier. I learned that the hard way. Otherwise, Talents trump everything, so look through characters and understand what they are capable of before you start leveling them up along a given path.","October 8, 2015","true","18.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Trust me in this one small thing Guardsman. They know."\nI stated in a previous review of mine (Templar Battleforce, check it out, fantastic game) the I prefer to write reviews AFTER a certain time played (e.g. 20 something hours onwards), and yet I find myself, once again it seems, in the curious position of breaking said rule. Both times the games in question were developed and produced by Trese Brothers, guess that says something about their games : )\nHeroes of Steel has that certain ... something about it. That charm, that spark that sucks you into its world, its gaping, gloomy, caveronous world.\nThe art fits the style (strange confusing sentance, I know) and has a rather charming qaulity to it (in particular Kincaid the Dueler, Tamlin the Thief and a certin Magus who I stole the above quote from), the music is once again truly epic and the combat is difficult enough to elicit moans and shouts but fair enough as to not result in a broken computer, i.e perfect. As other reviewers have stated there is a slight clunkiness when it comes to the UI (which personally has its own charm).\nThe only negetive point I can think of is actually in my Templar Battleforce review too:\nAn attack MUST target a foe. If you were to try to hurl your Lightning spear Into an unoccupied square in the middle of four enemies the game will instead ask if you want to move your Character there. Or If you were to target an Ally (there are actally situations were that could be advantageous), it will merely swap control over to that Character.\nIt really is only a minor complaint though, and in no way affected enjoyment of the game.\nThis is a fantastic Title and the developers deserve every measure of success.\nAlso, check out Templar Battleforce :) You won't regret it.","December 29, 2015","true","6.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

All their experience and ability came through to produce an excellent squad-based turn-based fantasy RPG, and it's a delight to be able to play it on a Mac laptop as well, since that's my main gaming device for longer games. I had played the majority of the campaign on my mobile devices, but on a desktop it does feel a more authentic experience, from the old days of playing these games on a desktop, on a big screen, with a mouse and keyboard. From my brief play session after getting this version, it seems to be flawlessly translated from my playthroughs on my iPad and Android devices, so I'm looking forward to having some more play time here.\n\nNow, some things do stand out as needing improvement for playing on a computer vs on a tablet/phone, namely the fact that there are no scrollbars on scrollable lists, meaning that you scroll by dragging the items like if you were swiping a finger on the screen; hovering the mouse over specific talents or icons should show a caption about what they mean; and I wasn't able to find a list for all the keyboard shortcuts in the game, but certainly for such a game you would benefit a lot by having extensive use of keyboard for the majority of the actions and talents. I know there are some shortcuts, but I missed a few in the tutorial and then wasn't able to find a reference or exhaustive list. Still, these are minor UI things that can certainly be ironed out, and I trust that they will.\n\nOverall, it's a good - and still evolving - story, fun and engaging gameplay, and if you do not come into it expecting a Baldur's Gate - or even Avadon-like - kind of game, but come with an open mind to experience an indie RPG, you might find a real gem here.\n\nLooking forward to coming chapters!","May 27, 2014","true","0.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

A game doesn't have to have perfect graphics if the mechanics, balance and pacing are good -- and for me, this game hits all three of those.\n\nEach of the four character slots has two options, each with different styles. I purchased all of the add-ons for my iPad and was VERY happy to see they were all automatically included and available on Steam. The replayability of the game comes from two things for me -- the different character builds (the Barbarian can be a Tank or a carry, depending on how you build him) and the plot options.\n\nThe first time I played through the game, I didn't realize how many of the choices would have impacts in later episodes. Think carefully about which side you want to support, if you support the warlord's rebellion, and which family is telling the truth.\n\nMy advice would be to build your fighting characters around one or two major talents, and focus on raising them to at least level 5.

Support from the developers is fantastic.\n\nReview\nA very good game! I backed the Kickstarter campaign to make this game and I'm really satisfied by this result.\n\nHeroes of Steel is a Turn based tactical RPG game. You lead a group of four characters who are wrongfully imprisoned through and escape and further adventures.\n\nThe characters have a delicate and well thought out balance, You get to choose how they upgrade their skills. Higher level skills are more expensive to use, so again, there is some balance to how far you want to upgrade a single skill. This leads to many meaningful and hard decisions.\n\nAI is nothing special yet in the first part, but I'm told it starts to employ different tactics soon in the second part, making it much harder to shield certain characters from physical harm.\n\nReplayability is  high: you can retry it with different builds for the same characters, or swap out some characters for other builds.\n\nAside from the gameplay in isolation, the storyline is also fun. The characters all have a different personality to them and the story is solid. The background story is there if you look for it, with snippets of flavour text in loading screens and hints in the game world. I think it's important in any RPG to have a good sense of the world around you and Heroes of Steel succeeds in this regard.\n\nGraphics are nothing special in terms of PC gaming, but they're crisp, functional and do help set the atmosphere.\n\nFurthermore, the Trese Brothers are extremely responsive to any questions, problems or suggestions you might have. They really engage in conversations to exchange ideas and try to see things from other people's perspective. It's incredible given that it's really just the two brothers making this happen and shows how well they really care about their customers and their products.","April 25, 2014","true","65.5"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ramou42/recommended/291190/","ramou42","stuart.thiel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ramou42/","190 products in account","Update, 7/17/2014\n\nI'm appending my review. Still not sure it's a $10 game, but it's getting closer. $7 and under it is worth buying if you like your oldschool fantasy tacticals. It'll easily amuse you, and amuse you in relatively small chunks if needed. It also has minimal overhead to get you going in the game. So, here's my updated review:\n\nAt long last, I've taken some time to play some more, from the top. I'm really happy that you adtressed some of my primary concerns. Namely, while there are a number of battles, they're shorter and to the point. You kill the enemies fast, and if you're careless, they kill you fast. The cost for failure is rolling back a turn and a permanent increment on your death count (or more than a turn if you were REALLY careless).\n\nThe item management is more sensible with default filtering, and I appreciated the shop-by-character mode in the shops that also showed your old weapon. I'm not sure if the chest loot is random, but it seemed a bit less annoying this time, as I didn't just get a ton of daggers like the first time.\n\nI'm still not crazy about the art style, but it is a style. I'd like to see more change in expression in the stills to highlight tone and communciate a bit more naturally. Not overused, but as a way to underline in a few more places... I also see that you've already taken a crack at this in your July release, so I should take a look to see what's new, as this may already be adressed.\n\nThe story pacing is not unreasonable, though there are a number of tropes. I'm curious enough to play through and see where it goes a bit further.\n\nThe side-quests were mostly clear, but I had to look to make sure I wasn't missing them.  I'm not sure there's a ready solution for this, and maybe one would have to be deliberately careless to avoid this... I don't know how enemies scale, but if you weren't leveling early by compelting everything, I'd be worried how quickly you'd get flattened.\n\nIs there a speed movement for when you scroll out and are running across a basically already explored map?\n\nI think the skill-tree might need some balancing. I'm not sure energy-cost to advantage is good. If in later towns you allow re-spec with a chunk of gold, that might not be a bad way to adress this, but variety for balance is something I'd consider. I might also suggest secondary attributes affecting abillities to spread usage, so range or aoe on heal by another stat, amount of damage on spells by another stat. Force the player to min-max less, or at least give options.\n\nFor buildings that you can enter, double clicking on them should make you walk up to the entrance and also go in. If you can't go inside and talk to somebody, it should do nothing. Right now, I think you need to be at the entrance, then double-click to go in, and I think this makes it easy to overlook talking to people.\n\nI also have my notes that I took during my second playthrough for minor "bugs" and other thoughts:\n*When leveling my thief, in the talents section, when I would cancel a skillup, it would not let me scroll back to the top of the list, always missing Aimed Shot. I would just go back and then into talents and it would work again, but I could repeat it by selecting a talent to train and then cancelling once more.\n*Just before Kern's Stair in the "dark tunnel" with the spiders, some of the squares don't seem to illuminate properly unelss you step on them, and even then there are some walls that are still black squares.\n*On rare occasions I have not noticed that I'm walking alone instead of in a glom and a battle will start. I find most of my time quite far away. This just sucks up time.\n*The sums for the accuracy and defence should be given on the Accuracy and Defense section of the stats. All I want is a quick glance and I have to do the math now.\n*In the nordhil troll quest, it didn't seem like the troll was regenerating\n*"Stealth gives a chance of Surprise, even when I am leading the group." implies a penalty to surprise when the rogue is leading, or at least suggests that the rogue's surprise bonus is applied just as well when not leading... clarifying this would help\n\n********\n\n\nThis game is not good. It's slow, meandering and frustrating. It's not "old-school hardcore", it's just unbalanced and kind of bad. the art is weak, the music is monotanous and the gameplay has nothing new.\n\nEvery few steps there will be a new battle. Every once in a while, you can skill up your characters with the levels you've gained since the last campfire. You gradually pick up items that uniformly upgrade your four canned characters in a systematic and even way, but most of it is still junk. Screenshots indicate "towns" and you get gold, so I assume eventually you can sell things. However, there is no inventory management till then, so you constantly have an unwieldy pile of crap to scroll through. Note that it doesn't even filter out items that can't be used by the current character, so it's just a pain.\n\nA lot of pain seems to have gone into making this a device for a tablet or touch screen. That may make it one of the most suitable RPGs for a tablet, since other ones may be all but unplayable, but it does not make it actually a good or useable game.\n\nI can't believe I paid $10-11 for this.","April 27, 2014","false","14.0"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","15","28","0","6"

Not all mobile ports is bad, but this port certainly doesn't take advantage of being ported to the PC, the is no resolution options (none that I could find, at least) and there is no window-mode option. Now that the rant about mobile ports are over, I'll move onto gameplay...\n\nNow as I mentioned above, I do like tactics game, but this game is very slow-paced and the animation seems a little clunky to me for a "pc game", which gives me a vibe of bad porting. The system to get information about abilities is clearly built for touch-devices and I would have preferred to have tool-tips when hovering over quick-abilities / talents instead.\n\nThe game-world and characters seems decent enough.\n\n"Heroes was made for fans of adventure RPGs, board games, and roguelikes. If you enjoy strategy games or tactical RPGs, you will enjoy this classic RPG." - from the store page... I have to blatantly disagree with this statement, I'm a fan and player of adventure RPGs, board games and Roguelikes. I do enjoy strategy games and tactical RPGs very much, I've played hundreds of hours of Tactics Ogre, Final Fantasy Tactics and the Agarest games. But to state that because I like those games I will like this one is probably an overstatement, as I haven't really enjoyed the PC version of this game.\n\nThis is a decent android game and I would certainly recommend the android game, but I wouldn't recommend the PC version. Maybe if they let me chose screen resolution, ability to play in windowed mode and chose animation speed I would be more inclined to recommend this game, but currently I will not.\n\nCharging 12$ for a bad port is outrageous, 5$ would be reasonable with the above-mentioned suggestions.\nI understand why they don't have a demo of this game, if they had people would be less inclined to buy the game.","April 26, 2014","false","2.7"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","16","30","0","7"

I have, however, played many, many hours on Android, and even written a review of the Android prologue version of the game (see link below for more in-depth information on the mobile version).  What I can tell you without a doubt is that you, Steam purchaser, will get a deep, lengthy, interesting tactical RPG.  Several differences between this and the mobile version - Steam includes all of the DLC/IAP from the mobile game.  As of the launch date (4/23/2014), that includes just over half of the entire story, and two of the four expansion characters.  By buying HoS on Steam, you will get the remaining two chapters and the remaining two characters once they are released.\n\nI can also assure you that the developers will continue to support and improve this game, almost constantly.  I've played all of their games on Android, and it's amazing how frequently they update with new content and improvements.  Give this game a try, you will not be disappointed.

Captain Lukai's blade..a symbol of forgiveness..redemption. Vraes wielded that blade with the precision and power of a mountain lion. Back and forth slowly he moved it, as if inviting the darkness to attack. The din of battle below had all but died as they moved higher into the keep, revenge was now on Vraes's mind. Sweat trickling down his brow, smeared away quickly with a filthy forearm greased from many battles.\n\nCalled back to by the click of Selen's dagger hilts he became aware..the shadows burst forth toward Vraes carrying that overpowering smell of filth.

Selen shadowed behind him almost seeming more to glide than to run, eyes darting hither and fro, blades following swiftly behind. An Orcin elite trying to flank Kjartan..fell dead before a grimly smiling Selen. Crackling flames burst forth from the cloaked wizard, brows peering forward..leaving a trail of acrid smoke past Selen, two of the Baron's archers collapsed with a crunch.\n\nAll draws quiet for a moment.

The writing is solid but not noteworthy ie pleasant to read but no originality and no depth.\n\nBut as you go deeper in the game, problems cumulate:\n- Too many combats, and it feels more and more repetitive as you progress in the game, that's why I gave up during episode 2.\n- Enemies diversity is too low, during episode 1 the feeling of repetition is growing, but episode 2 aggravates the problem.\n- There's many mechanisms flawed that burden the play, boring instant death, bad design of stealth gameplay, ton of walk back to rest becoming more and more tedious, boring heavy random elements that could trigger unpleasant instant death.\n- The combat system design is flawed because you can just retreat a bit and camp to kill enemies one per one. At first you go over it, but the more you play the more this design flaw becomes frustrating, each time you try a more interesting approach and get bashed by the game.\n- There's good areas but also few bad, and a significant amount quite average, and as you play more, the average areas become more and more tedious to play.\n\nStill, I repeat it my introduction, I don't recommend it in general, but players very fans of indie RPG with turn based combats should check this game. The game could worth it for turn based RPG fans that can go over a very bad user interface because of a very bad port from mobile.","June 10, 2014","false","108.1"," 10 of 29 people (34%) found this review helpful","34","10","29","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomineh/recommended/291190/","nomineh","Nomine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomineh/","759 products in account",""Normal" difficulty\n\nHeroes of Steel: Tactics RPG is a tactical role-playing game that feels slow and later tedious,... with a few updates to the HUD, mana issues (IMO) and combat, the game could be great.\n\nEarly on you get a good impression that the game has a lot to offer, but soon after the battles become overwhelming and slow-paced, instead of quick, fun and tactically challenging. Early in the game you get a pretty good amount of consumables to help you survive, but when the enemies start coming in 5s, even 10s, you'll be very close to death (for example, 1 minion can hit 3x40, while your healer can heal 32 hp at a time).\n\nThe mana is used up way too fast because you have to keep on healing your characters. The health potions and mana potions heal/restore around 50-100 points of HP/MP, but when every character is using mana in order to look out for traps, heal characters, use buffs, debuffs etc. the potions get used up very quickly when you can't get enough of them from chests.\n\nEdit: I just can't continue right now. Im out of mana on all characters after fighting all the monsters... I can't find more and I'm stuck fighting without having any abilities. I can't possibly beat these 10 spiders with what I have at the end, even if only my tank was taking damage from the enemies and my ranged characters had some mana left.\n\nI did get pretty far (to the spider area after 2 road blocks, killing everything including 4 giant rats before them) thanks to the potions I found, but now I'm stuck after fighting all the monsters.. as if they had to be skipped in order to save potions. I'm tired of restoring characters in order to get further. I'm done with the game.\n\nI did try but.. I can't recommend the game right now.","June 10, 2014","false","5.9"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","11"

This game really needs several rounds of polish - not just of the UI (which is extremely rough) but also of the tactical gameplay on which the game rests its name.

First, there are no changeable settings, apart from toggling sound, music, and blood on and off. Saving is done automatically. Frustratingly, you cannot use arrow keys to navigate menus and even capitalizing requires you to push a "shift" key rather than use your keyboard's shift and caps lock keys. If you want to perform an action, you have to first click it to select it, then click it again to find out what it actually does and its AP and casting costs, then click back and on your target to actually use it. Perhaps after a while you'll have memorized that information, but for a new player it is very tedious. There are so many reminders that this is a port of a mobile game that it makes a game that's not very fun to start with pretty much a chore to actually play.","April 26, 2014","false","5.6"," 7 of 24 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","7","24","0","5"
