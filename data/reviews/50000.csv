There are a lot of optional levels, you can configure how you want the checkpoints to work, and your time records don't unlock any content or anything so it doesn't matter if you don't care about trying to accomplish them.\n\nHowever...\n\nIf you _are_ interested in time records, be aware that Nimbus has one enormous bug: it bases its records on how much time elapses in the real world between the beginning and the end of the level, rather than how many game ticks pass in that time. So depending on how powerful your computer is, falling through the same vertical space without pressing any keys may take you anywhere from 4 seconds to 30 or more. Lowering your resolution and turning off graphical effects can help with this on some of the levels, but these are not adjustments you should be forced to make to fix a gameplay issue.","November 25, 2013","true","28.6"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","0"

The sense of momentum and the feeling of zipping through the air is really fun. Shooting out of cannons, bouncing off of launch pads, diving from great heighs; it all feels good. The game introduces new mechanics, level features and techniques steadily throughout the game, so it's never stale. The music is great, and suits the relaxing and exhilarating aspects of the game very well. Collecting the coins and completing the scrapyard stages after finishing the main game is also very rewarding and satisfying. The graphics/art style are also superb.\n\nOnly problem I had with the game was that the boss battle felt a bit out of place, turning the game from acrobatic/racing game into bullet hell for the last level.","February 21, 2014","true","14.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Of course there are optional extra collectables along the way, alternate exits to alternate worlds, Super Mario World style, and enough new hazards and abilities to contend with that it kept my interest long before I ran out of new levels.\n\nWorks really well as a casual pass-the-pad multiplayer game. It's a lot more forgiving than something like Super Hexagon. Nobody's going to be on for too long but nobody's getting an early bath after five seconds. Well... not often.\n\nFeels very much like a game you might find stuffed in a corner in a seaside arcade or find on an Amiga disk with half a Chinese label on it - you'll want to tell people about it, when you remember, but most of them will almost certainly never play it and you're not sure of the name or where you played it.\n\nMaybe you should stop smoking weed.","September 25, 2014","true","2.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You don't have an engine, your engine is gravity, and special platforms within the game like bumpers, speed ups or other graviational devices.

It's in the same category of game, in that it's an action platformer with puzzle-y elements.\n\nIt differs from Meat Boy in that you have to keep up momentum. Generally this means that, while you can slow down in Meat Boy, you can't here. There are easier levels and harder levels (and impossible ones), and I've found that I get the same sort of satisfaction from beating a level in Nimbus that I did in Super Meat Boy.\n\nI don't want to compare the two games too much, because there are a couple giant differences. The momentum thing is one. Another is it's a fair bit more puzzle-y and less twitch gameplay. Also, I really like the art style.

You're a little spaceship trying to navigate charmingly rendered 2D-levels to reach the goal (and if you like, find the cleverly hidden coins). There's only one problem: your ship has no method of propulsion. Instead you'll have to make use of sparingly placed cannons (which also serve as limited-use checkpoints) to gain momentum and propel yourself around the stages. This is a game to return to again and again, with tons of content to experience even after you defeat the last boss.","March 30, 2013","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The fun gameplay you'd expect from an addictive Flash game combined with some nice visuals. Main campaign will take you about 2 hours to beat, but the replay value in the levels is trying to get the hidden coins. I'd give it a 7/10. Try to grab it for $5 or less.","August 11, 2012","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You steer a glider that follows the basic rules of gravitation (speeds up if it falls and gets slower if you try to pull up). You can only turn left or right so the handling can get very tricky in close situations. If you hit spikes or come to a total halt you lose.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYH9IJCAMzU","January 3, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
