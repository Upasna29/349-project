I remember this one from my teen years as a hilarious strategy simulation with an innovative concept, especially for its day. I spent days with my retail copy of the game, trying to find ways of releasing those trapped ghosts so I can recruit them! Ghost Master was developed by Sick Puppies Studio in 2003 and enjoyed some critical acclaim due to its intriguing concept. Yet, the game failing on a commercial level, the company closed its doors and Ghost Master remained to be a one shot wonder. Now looking back and enjoying the gameplay yet again, I can positively say that the game lost little in its fun and aged quite nicely anyhow.\n\nWelcome, Ghost Master! You are an incorporeal entity: a commander of the spirits of long deceased, haunting this realm to drive those silly mortals out of their wits! ...and you got summoned by a bunch of teenagers via an Ouija board for kicks. Immediately, you get rid of those pesky mortals by summoning your servants and set HQ in the abandoned school in Gravenville. Your next task: scaring the heck out of all those mortals inhabiting your town, teaching them paranormal lessons for their various misdeeds and recruiting new members for your team while you are at it. Enjoy!\n\nOkay, this all sounds wonderful. You are a big, bad ghost master capable of controlling various ghosts and scaring people... But remember that mortals are not defenseless. You'll face witches, mediums, mad scientists and ghostbreakers - actually ghostbusters, but you know, copyright issues - and try to overcome many challenges in each new mission you are introduced with. Gravenville also comes with its own distinct setting, consisting of countless parodies centering paranormal horror stories like Blair Witch, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, Phantom of the Opera etc. Characters have their own stories wrapped in situational comedy.\n\nTalking about gameplay dynamics, in each mission you are to choose a team of 4-8 ghosts in your repertoire and go on for the haunting. As you win missions, you are given gold plasm based on the success of your haunting, calculated according to how much of a havoc you've managed to wreck in the building: how many mortals scared, any of your haunters get banished, how many new recruits you've managed to save etc. At the end of the haunt, you can visit your HQ and use gold plasm to train your ghosts to unlock many new abilities, building up different strategies for different missions.\n\nThe game environment and graphics basically seem like The Sims 2 with a couple story buildings, AI people interacting with the environment and each other. Main difference is that you are the intruder. All your ghosts, depending on their types, need different fetters - items or places that they can be bound to, so their area of influence is limited. This is where the strategy part comes in. You collect plasm during the mission by scaring them and use collected plasm to activate their power levels, also arranging orders for when to use certain powers. Most levels come with puzzles to figure out and as you unlock new missions, things get harder and harder. All missions contain various other ghosts that you can newly recruit if you are to figure out how to free them from their mortal entrapments. They all will ask for certain obscure conditions in riddles to be met and figuring those conditions out is the half of your job. Once figured out, you are left with strategy and patience.\n\nWell, I think that would be all. The game isn't that long, but you are welcome to revisit old missions to gather gold plasm, unlocking new abilities and trying new strategies. The Steam and GOG versions of the game contain a new level at the end that wasn't presented in the original version and it is insanely hard. There is some talk that a fan-made Ghost Master 2 is in development at the moment, so fingers crossed!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","May 1","true","12.8"," 42 of 42 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","42","42","0","0"

In Ghost Master, you control an organisation of ghosts, spectres and horrors. Your objectives range from the simple and amusing frightening of mortals to gather energy from their fear to more complicated matters such as making sure the mortals find the bodies of murder victims to appease their spirits and many other tasks that are suitible for one controlling ghosts and spirits.\nMany levels have oppertunities to pick up new ghosts for your future missions, with their requests ranging from complicated tasks such as proving the corruption of one mortal to an other to the relatively simple tasks of freeing them from a fetter or bond placed upon them by breaking it in some way. The key aspect here is that you can not go and just smash or destroy the object yourself. You will need to use either your team's powers to control the circumstances such as the wind and rain or the mortals in a mission. Ghost Master will let you feel like you're playing a god...All while delegating these tasks to your ghosts and having goals set by someone or something higher up the chain of command. You organise an invisible force that tries to acomplish its goals through subtle manipulation of the mortals. Mortals who themselves might intervene in your plans - maybe they call in a medium to try to banish your ghosts, or perhaps they're just incredibly stubborn and refuse to believe in ghosts. Whatever the case, you can choose to do the absolute minimum needed, you can just scare off the mortals in as entertaining matters as you can...Or you can subtly manipulate them to do your bidding, get all the potential ghosts freed and play with those scared fools by checking on their individual fears and phobias to scare them as best as possible for as little energy as possible, or try to drive them insane(Though complete insanity is a thing that usually only works on those who are already unhinged, or with a LOT of time). Every one of them is different, with their own fears and a bio, their own jobs to do, their own behaviors their own relationships, and so on.\nMany of the levels include a puzzle-like request by a ghost, having you complete a task to set them free(At which point they join you for future missions). Usually this is a matter of resolving a last grievance they had while alive, or to do them a favour or break the item that holds them there. Some are easy, and others are incredibly hard.\n\nThe ghosts are controlled by placing them at a fetter, something that they identify with and can use to stay in the physical realm. Something that fits them that they can inhabit in the physical world. It could be an electrical appliance for a gremlin, or a fireplace for a fire elemental, or objects with an emotional charge to them, a place, or even a child. You control what powers they have access to by feeding them energy, which you extract automatically from the fear of mortals(And powers with a bigger effect tend to have a higher cost).\nMortals who do not believe in ghosts are harder to scare, so you need to boost their belief in the spirit world by odd events, such as rain indoors, unnatural cold, heat or luck, a sudden storm coming out of nowhere or several other things that don't quite fit or erode their mental barriers...Which coincidentally makes them easier to scare.\n\nBut then there aren't only good things. The story ends on a cliffhanger, and sometimes the favour needed to free a ghost can be annoyingly frustrating and appear based on random chance more than your own actions. The game's recommend haunting team does not always have the powers needed to complete these favours, and you do not know what you're going to find in a level until you check it out. There are no missions aside from the story ones, and in my personal opinion there weren't enough that were simple missions to scare away everyone, or a sandbox mode - Just for the fun of it all.\n\nWhatever the case, you'll spend hours enjoying building your team, toying with the mortals or just trying to do the missions, in the end it is well worth the price. If you're not entirely sure even then, it goes on sale quite often and you can pick it up for incredibly cheap almost every steam sale.","June 27, 2015","true","0.1"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","31","35","0","0"

Might be something like having the authorites come to a certain room to find out about a previous murder, or scare everyone out of the building.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goodguynickpt/recommended/6200/","goodguynickpt","Good Guy Nick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goodguynickpt/","418 products in account","In Ghost Master, you command an army of ghosts and are trusted with completing an array of different objectives.\nThe story takes place in Gravenville, a town where a lot of paranormal activity takes place, after a group of teenagers summons you – the Ghost Master.\nBefore entering a haunting, you must choose which ghosts you take with you. You can pick anyone you want, but sometimes, especially when you are trying a level for the first time, it is better to press “Recommended” which will pick the best available ghosts in your army for said level.\nOnce you’re in, there are 4 main features you must worry about: Haunters, Fetters, Plasm and Mortals.\nThere are 47 playable ghosts and you can choose where to place them and which powers they can use. You can’t directly control them, so you need to learn when and which powers you want each of them to use and which orders to give (Allow a ghost to go after someone on its own or even use a certain power when no one is around). You start off by commanding a small army of classic horror characters, like the jack-of-all-trades ghost Boo or the glowing poltergeist Whirlweird. You will also be able to rescue restless spirits throughout the game (every level has at least one of these), increasing your army’s size and versatility. These trapped ghosts need to be set free but that is easier said than done. During the first levels, most ghosts are fairly easy to recruit; maybe you’ll need to destroy the fetter they’re on or scare someone they hated when they were alive. Later, though, there are a couple of complex puzzles you need to solve that require a lot of planning – make a certain person use a fetter or carry something across the building to a certain location. These are hard to figure out but extremely satisfying when solved.\nThere are 6 kinds of ghosts in the game: Sprites, Disturbances, Elementals, Vapours, Frighteners and Horrors. Each type of ghost has a certain area of expertise. Sprites, for instance, consume little to no plasm (the game’s “resource”), which allows them to use most of their powers early on. They are usually bound to smaller fetters, usually electrical, and can make them malfunction and cause blackouts or power surges. Horrors and Frighteners, on the other hand, consume large amounts of plasm and can terrorize mortals like no one else can. They can possess humans and materialize into gruesome sights, making them useful to get rid of humans who are harder to scare.\nGhosts can also level up; the more you use a certain ghost in the field, the higher its training level. Higher levels mean you will be able to give said ghost a bigger number of ever more complex orders, making its powers more effective and allowing you to let it haunt on its own, while you focus on something else. There are 8 training levels for each ghost.\nFetters are where you can place your ghosts. You can’t just simply place them wherever you want, which makes planning ahead and ambushing something to consider. Certain ghosts can only be bound to mirrors, for example, making them very useful if used strategically, while others can be bound to sleeping mortals, children, water or even emotional objects.\nThere are 2 kinds of plasm. Normal and gold.\nRegular plasm is something you need to summon ghosts and to use their powers. The stronger the ghosts, the more plasm they need to be bound to a fetter and the harder it gets to manage used and available plasm. Plasm is not spent – rather, you allocate an amount of available plasm to a ghost. If you need a certain haunter to use a more powerful spell, you can just unsummon one of the other fettered ghosts so the used plasm doesn’t surpass the maximum amount of available resources or make it use a weaker power which does not use as much plasm. Scaring people is the only way of earning a bigger plasm threshold – that is quite simple and straight forward when you need to scare all the mortals away from a level; on the other hand, when you get to levels where you can’t scare any of them away or you have a more subtle objective that doesn’t involve scaring, it is a rather tense experience. It is all a matter of balance. Failing to do so will have you banned from the mortal realm and you’ll have to try again.\nGold Plasm can be used to buy new powers for your ghosts. You can usually choose different powers for ghosts in the same category, making a more versatile army. Gold Plasm is earned by completing levels and time trials.\nEach mortal has a Terror (Red), Belief (Blue) and Madness (Yellow) bar. Some powers cause belief; mortals with low belief are less affected by terror – so you’ll want to increase all sceptics’ belief before attacking them with your terror powers; this will generate more plasm – so you can power-up stronger powers or bind more haunters. You can also take over a human’s mind, making them go insane. People with phobias or older individuals are more susceptible to this. When a mortal’s willpower reaches its Terror or Madness cap, mortals will either flee or go crazy. Mad mortals provide great entertainment and can also help you – terrorizing the rest of their fellow humans with their insane actions.\nA big part of humans you use to your advantage is fear – conscious and subconscious. All mortals have them. There are some powers that allow you to uncover said fears. When you know what a certain person is afraid of, you’ll be able to use powers which are absurdly more effective than most others. If someone is afraid of blood, for instance, you can just attract the mortal to a bathroom and use a power that turns water into blood, or make it come out of the walls or even flood the whole room with it. Same goes for spiders, darkness, being trapped or even loud noises.\nFortunately, mortals are not defenseless. You will meet humans that can banish your ghosts from the mortal realm, thus, making them unusable until the end of the haunting. From witches that summon protective circles, to exorcists, you’ll have to battle with all of them to be successful.\nMortals’ AI isn’t all that great; they get stuck fairly often and they tend to do the opposite of what you want them to do. Pathfinding is also an issue when the action takes place in smaller areas.\nYou do feel like you are haunting a small town because some of the characters you meet during the first levels will show up later in different locations and they also have the same fears and personalities.\nLevels are extremely well designed and varied– Mortals have a lot of escape routes to temporarily run away from your ghosts and you will need to improvise new tactics and approaches because humans will react to pretty much everything you do.\nGraphics are colorful and the game doesn’t take itself too seriously – which is quite refreshing, in my opinion. It is quite rare for a game about being a ghost and scaring people to embrace such a tongue-in-cheek, comedic approach.\nGhost Master also features a soundtrack I consider perfect. It sets the right atmosphere from the very beginning and I still listen to it from time to time.\nThis game pays clear homage to classic horror tropes; you’ll get the ghost bride that was left at the altar and even the headless horseman who was killed during the civil war. As you can see, movie references are scattered all over the game and characters and levels are smartly named “after” classic movies –“Phantom of the Operating Room” or “Blair Wisp Project”.\nA game that I recommend to everyone. It may look a little bit dated and it may have flimsy AI, but Ghost Master is an inventive game that brings us new gameplay mechanics and is undeniably a game brought to us by people who love and care for their work. The attention to detail and the countless amount of movie references and replay value make it my favorite game of all time.\n\nFinal Score: 9 out of 10.","September 23, 2015","true","20.1"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","23","26","0","1"

By doing so, they will slowly become vulnerable to your scaring tactics and powers.

You can also train your ghosts so that they can learn new powers or enhance their scaring abilities. It's your choice of strategy whether how you want to scare the current residents. The main goal of the game is to scare out all the residents from the house.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who loves the classic scaring games genre.\n\nNOTE: If you want this game, you should buy it during a sale.

There are around 50 ghosts in total and each haunter has its own personality, strengths and weaknesses. The spooks that work for you fall under six categories: sprites, disturbances, elementals, vapours, frighteners, and horrors named after their characteristics and skills. Skills can range from "Rattle Chains" and "Fog" to "Ghostly Apparition" and "Paralyze". Some ghosts are more beneficial in certain situations than others depending on the mission. Each time you scare a mortal you will increase your plasm; the energy that's needed to frighten them to begin with (ghost skills cost plasm to use). Scare them too much and people will flee from the building before all your goals are met, which can make your job more difficult. Mortals also have their own levels of belief, terror, and madness rendering them at times irrational, afraid or even insane! That can affect gameplay for the ghosts assigned to haunt them.  Watch out for  priests, witches, mediums and ghostbreakers, these humans have the ability to banish your ghosts until the misson is over. Missions can be both fun & humorous, poking fun at movies and TV shows (Titles like eg. Ghostbreakers, Poultrygeist, and Phantom of the Operating Room). Once the goals for a level have been met, the game rates your progress. It factors in time, the impact on the mortals your ghosts haunted, and how many mortals fled. If you completed the mission fairly quickly, a multiplier is added to the final score. This score relates the amount of "Gold Plasm" given, which can now be used to add more skills to spook crew!\n****A very unique, funny and highly enjoyable game! Loved it and fully recommend it!

Because I think someone made Ghost Master just for you. As the titular master of ghosts, you take an assortment of spooks and specters into different homes and buildings with the intent of driving out the residents. Each ghost has specific things it can haunt, like electronics or damp things, and several powers that unlock as you scare more and more people. There are also ghosts you can recruit during missions by completing certain tasks, foes to overcome like police and ghostbuster-types, and high scores to shoot for in each level. There are some clever locales to haunt too, like sorority houses, mystery mansions, cabins in the woods, schools, and more.\n\nThe game plays like a cross between real-time strategy and puzzle. You can give your ghosts orders and have to manage your spooking power between them, but scaring off mortals and completing tasks is more a matter of getting the right ghost in the right place. It's a terribly charming little game that is unfortunately starting to show its age, and can be a bit frustrating if certain people or ghosts don't path the way you need them to. Since you have no direct control over movement, tasks that require specific placement can be a chore to complete. Minor gripes aside, this a is perfect lighthearted game for the season, and one that most likely anyone can enjoy.","September 15, 2015","true","2.8"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","14","19","3","4"

In this case, you'll control a group of ghosts, called "haunters", in an attempt to scare the hell out of mortals. It's a Strategy/Puzzle game, and some missions require you to complete different tasks from scaring. Most of these special tasks involve using mortals to interact with certain objects that your ghosts can't use (not correctly, at least). All the ghosts are unique as each one of them as their starting skills and base behaviour (altough many details are never addressed by the game, it's something you pick up with experience). All of them have their special fetter, or a place where you can "bind" them, or summon them in the livings' world. Fetters vary from free roaming to being linked to a peculiar condition, with varying rarity. Often, strict links mean powerful ghosts. Most of the ghosts will be locked at the beginning, and will need to be rescued during missions. Each one of them as its unique rescuing requirement. But I already spoiled too much, I'll let your curiosity take over and try out this little art piece ;).","November 29, 2014","true","15.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Summoning ghosts costs ectoplasm as well as interacting with the physical world. As you cause trembling mortals to void their bowels with terror, you build more ectoplasm. More ectoplasm means more ghosts, and more terrifying ghost powers. Lastly, while you're haunting a place, you may encounter local ghosts who are bound to something in the house.

You have an arsenal of ghosts available to you and you want to scare people in a Sims type environment. The game starts of great with a cheesy fmv, you get to scare people in different ways with different ghosts.\n\nUnfortunately, they took it a step too far for me. The third and fourth mission were very puzzly. You needed to use certain ghosts in certain situations or you wouldn't be able to progress.\n\nI completed the third mission a little bit aggrevated because you needed to guide people to certain locations which was a chore. The mission after that was straight up "use this ghost in this situation to trigger this event, then use another ghost to do this and that".\n\nI wish they just kept it to scaring people and didn't make you solve puzzles. There is depth in just scaring people since certain people are scared of certain things.\n\nI wouldn't recommend it if you're not into the puzzles. Still, it's quite an unique game and I might persevere to see if things change.\n\nEDIT: I made it to the final mission before I became too frustrated to continue. As expected, most of the later missions are puzzle based and can be quite frustrating without a guide (in some cases even with a guide). The final mission is completely bonkers, in a bad way. You're reliant on luck for a correct scenario to occur and you pretty much need a certain secret ghost to complete it.\n\nIf you do pick this up, I would recommend using a guide if you're feeling frustated.\n\nUnfortunately even with a guide I was able to get stuck in a mission because I didn't have the proper ghost power to proceed. My only options were to go replay a previous mission and unlock a secret ghost that had that ghost power or go buy it for one of my existing ghosts (which wasn't an option as I already spent my coin for powers on other ghosts). I ended up editing my game with a save game editor to get that power.\n\nThis game was an unique experience.

You start out with a handful of ghosts to send a group of college girls screaming from their sorority house. Over time, you get to recruit spirits to tackle more challenging scenarios.\n\nMany of the characters and scenarios in this game are inspired by TV shows, movies, and comics. Recognizing these pop culture references may get you chuckling. I’ve spotted references to The Evil Dead, Casper, Ghostbusters, The Three Stooges, and many more. The whole concept of gathering ghosts to scare off mortals makes this game immensely fun, especially when plenty of humor is thrown in. It certainly helps that many of the scenarios are cleverly designed.\n\nDespite all the good things going for this game, some of the fun is sapped out of it when trying to figure out what powers should be activated to get mortals to do certain actions. For example, in one scenario, you need to send three mortals to a cabin to complete a ritual, but the mortals would first have to find a way to cross a raging river and a deep chasm. Since the solution to these and other problems isn’t always obvious, you may need to experiment with different powers before making headway.\n\nThis wouldn’t have been a problem if not for the fact that mortals move around the map randomly like characters in The Sims. Some will use the bathroom, take a drink of water, or converse with their friends at random moments. While it does seem natural to have mortals behaving in this manner, it doesn’t help if you have to wait a long time for a mortal to do a particular action, such as bringing a gift to a specific room. If you aren’t even sure that what you’re attempting will work as intended, then having to wait more than a minute becomes an exercise in frustration.\n\nEven with these problems, Ghost Master is highly entertaining. If scaring the bejesus out of little computer people sounds like fun (and believe me, it is), do yourself a favor and get yourself a copy now.\n\nFor a more in-depth review, see my blog page[standoutgames.blogspot.com].","January 15, 2014","true","80.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I really, really do.\nThe concepts are solid, the visuals are very good and the senarios are intriguing.  It makes you wonder what could have been if there had been more planning and polish.\n\nHowever, a few levels in it becomes a punishing experience because you are often at the mercy of the clumbsy AI pathfinding and baffling level design that more often than not makes things much more frustrating than they have to be.  Combine that with poorly explained goals that only get worse as you go along, and you get a game that just isn't worth playing to completion.","November 25, 2013","false","16.0"," 31 of 58 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","31","58","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vhazen/recommended/6200/","Vhazen","Queen Chrysalis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vhazen/","342 products in account","Ghost Master is a game most people have never heard of. In fact, even during its release in 2003 it never received much publicity or commercialism. This is because it wasn't really a "big project" in the first place. Basically no one ever heard of Sick Puppies, the developing company, because they had only released one other game before: Pipe Dreams 3D, two years prior to this game. Sick Puppies remained true to its name in the business due to the fact they were, well, a sick company. They disbanded only a year after the release of Ghost Master, though to this day the game still has a cult following, and for very good reasons.\n\nGhost Master is an extremely original game, with unique, haunting and spiritual music (of which is perhaps my favorite aspect of this game), gameplay and level design. You play the role of a Ghost Master, which is basically just a name for you as you scroll around in this RTS 3D world and try to best command the spirits in your arsenal to accomplish certain objectives - mostly involving the casting of "spells" (powers) to scare mortals until they run away from the level, earning you victory when all mortals are gone - or else left insane, which I might add is hard to do, but really funny to see. The abilities of your ghosts depend on the individual and type, and you can unlock more ghosts by playing levels and finding "restless spirits" which you can talk to, and they give you a quest-like objective which you must find a way to complete before you finish their unfinished business, or else free them.\n\nThe diversity and imagination of the ghosts themselves is really interesting in the regard that it is heavily inspired by many spiritual cultures and myths. Some ghosts are elementals, others are Gremlins, which are the wild spirits of animals, and others are poltregiests, the tortured spirits of humans who were once mortals. Each ghost has a unique mini-profile with an amusing backstory, and a semi-unique set of powers you can purchas as training with the points you earn for completing levels. This currency is called Gold Plasm.\n\nEvery ghost has a specific kind of fetter (a place or a type of thing) they can bind themselves to at your command when playing a level, based on their type or perhaps how they died. This also can relate to how a restless spirit might be trapped in a level, waiting for you to free them and unlock them. One of my more favorite spirits was an air elemental named Whisperwind, a fairy-like being who was trapped in a dream-catcher which you have to destroy.\n\nThe game itself is quite tacky with its graphics, but at the same time the art style and atmosphere sends a very good at making you feel immersed in the creepiness of it all. It's easy to imagine how scared the mortals must be of you, walking around in all those locations you haunt. You will sometimes still chuckle at the plastic hair of mortals and french-fry fingers of some of your ghosts with all their silly low quality models.\n\nThe gameplay, as mentioned before, is extremely unique, as I've never seen a single game to this day that really has the same kind of mechanics you see in this classic gem. The game is also quite buggy sometimes, and I can't promis you you wont ever flip your table in rage due to mortals not doing what you want them to.\n\nFirst, you go to a specific place to haunt, where you will be met with a short intro to the area and its history before being sent to a screen where you select which ghosts to use from your collection. Once you've decided on that, it's your job to use the powers of your ghosts to accomplish whatever the specific goal is. Sometimes you have to use your powers to manipulate the environment so the mortals can get to where you need them. Before you can get to any of that though, you first must spawn your spirits by binding them to things within the level, related to their fetter list. So the bigger aspects of the game is trying to balance the powers of spirits in relation to its placement availability in a level. It is possible and required in some levels to have a spirit with electricty powers bound to some piece of equipment that a mortal will have to be led to carry into another room, with your ghost attatched.\n\nThe levels of the game are almost some kind of refference to pop-culture horror films or other fiction that some weirdos like me will find extremely amusing. The game is a strange mix of humor and horror like no other - involving tacky and almost slap-stick themes while at the same time having a disturbingly chilling environment at times that you can't help but feel mistified by. This is perhaps one of the game's strongest qualties - the combination of a spooky atmosphere, fun gameplay and a light air of occasional black comedy that keeps the player on their toes as they enjoy the ride - up until at some point they trip and fall over due to one of the game's occasionally irritatingly hard levels. This game isn't perfect, and sometimes you *will* get mad at it.\n\nIn the end, I think it's still a great classic and a shame that no sequels are being made. Not officially anyway. Though some indi developers are trying somewhat to get something going (you can find them easily by googling Ghost Master 2), there's no telling if they'll ever really finish, as very little is shown so far. Right now, Ghost Master is availabe to everyone here at the stock price of 5 USD, which in my opinion is a great price. It's definetly not a fancy game. It doesn't have amazing graphics (despite its interesting theme and art style), it's kind of glitchy sometimes, and hardly anyone knows about it and the developing company is literally dead now.\n\nIf you're still unsure about this game, then wait for halloween. In all the time I've been on Steam, I've seen Ghost Master go on sale for 1.50 USD or so every single time, as one of the first things to go on sale. That's practically making this game free, and once its in your hands, it's easy to get addicted to. It has decent replayability, and I've finished it like 5 times already in all the time I've had this game. I actually grew up with this, but I lost the disc and recently saw the game for sale here. It was so cheap, I couldn't resist just getting it again.\n\nPS: I am running this game on Windows 7. Some people complain that this game is rejected by the opperating system. I actually experienced this myself, but there's an easy. fix. I unfortunately don't remember it now.. But a quick google search only took me a couple minutes to get this game working correctly.","October 28, 2011","true","40.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Is this spirit not getting freed because the power i'm trying to use isn't the right one, or because the humans just haven't gotten around to reacting to it yet?

Viewed isometrically, you control a variety of ghouls and spirits to haunt a variety of locations and drive the residents into fits of terror and into vacating the premises with much haste, and preferably screaming. A good game to play not just on halloween, but any occasion for anyone who wants to enjoy a game that's not too heavily paced and lets you experiment and discover things on your own. Lots of different ways to complete various levels, and new haunts to free and unlock for your own use, make this game intruiging, with a good replay value. Train your haunts with more abilities using gold plasm which you can earn from making people scream, faint, and flee. Discover your subject's deepest fears and utilize them to maximize their terror and send them screaming into the night. It's good to be evil.","November 19, 2010","true","5.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The graphics are not bad for that time and are still not unpleasant. It can take a while though to build up everyone's fear meters enough to scare them out of a house so you will be looking at the same graphics for a while and they will make you miss your shiny new graphics because they are actually pretty dull. But your ghosts have pretty neat effects.

I would rather have real spoken english.

This is fine on it's own, nothing exciting, but fine. However, for them to read it all three must be in the cellar. I managed to get two down there, from what I can only assume was a glitch in the programming, but the third one (a lady if it matters) would not, under any cirumstance, go down there. I sat there for almost two hours waiting for the dumb broad to walk down there but instead she looked at book then put it back, sat down in two different chairs, looked in the fridge, washed her hands then walked to the out-house and took a ♥♥♥♥, got up, walked back to the fridge, walk back to the outhouse and took another ♥♥♥♥, walked back in and sat down on a chair. This cycle went on for *TWO HOURS* I tried luring her over to the cellar, but as soon as the charm wore off she went and took a dump and went back to the same cycle as before. I eventually was forced into restarting the "Mission" because of the broken cycle, but choose not too. Suffice to say it's unlikely I'll ever play the game again. For what it's worth, it's well worth the 1.24, because what parts do work are pretty fun.","June 3, 2015","false","4.5"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","41","9","22","3","4"

I want to like this, I really do, but I just can't.

And even if you do figure out the "puzzles" sometimes the game will just refuse to let you solve it by flat out not having a person go into the room you need them in to solve the "puzzle".\n\nThe first couple of stages are simple enough to be kind of fun, but as you get further in the game quickly turns into a horrendous, frustrating slog.\n\nReally a pity.","November 4, 2011","false","2.5"," 14 of 33 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","14","33","0","0"

The cinematics were low-res. I wasn’t really impressed by it but it is from 2003. I didn’t realise it was so old until after I played the game. Looks a lot like the Sims.\n\nThe gameplay is not too bad. I got the hang of it with a bit of fiddling around (after skipping the tutorial). Doesn’t really seem to be a way to lose from what I saw (but I only played the first level). The mortals sound like they are speaking german or something. The most impressive thing about the game was the way you input your name. There is a transition from a cutscene to an interactive circular ouija board; you spell your desired name out on the board.\n\nOn steam the full price is $5 and I’m not sure that it would be worth it. I find it hard to be optimistic that i would enjoy playing it much more. At the moment it is 85% percent off and only $0.74 which is a really low price for any game.\n\nClick here for more let’s play videos =)","June 27, 2014","false","0.3"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","0"

Though its quite similar I much prefer the Sega game to this only because it was much more simple to control and you didn't have to worry about placing minions. One map in this game took me an hour to scare one person out of the house. I lost interest afterwards for that reason and because I couldnt enjoy the game in the resolution I was forced to play in, it's all blurry and disgusting. So be warned this game does not support a full screen 1900 resolution and the controls are iffy. Also, the people you try to haunt speak in a repetitive weird language which gets annoying fast.","August 18, 2014","false","1.0"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","0"

This is basically the Sims turned on it's head where instead of building up a virtual family or a house, your building up an ability to scare the pants off of the local Sims population.\n\nComplete with a multitude of nods to various movies and fictions, this game is packed with a tool set for the player to create his or her own brand of mayhem, and an almost unparalleled ability to cause spontaneous bursts of maniacal laughter. There really is something brilliant about having engineered circumstances just right so that a house full of Sims having a party is turned into complete chaos with all the party guests running and screaming around the map.\n\nThere are some downsides. For instance, I still find the initial scenario and learning curve a bit clunky, and the interface is a bit micro management-ish, until you get used to it and get comfortable with the alternatives and shortcuts. There are also some minor bugs and occasionally you may find it difficult to advance a scenario as there is often no clear indication of what to do. (This is actually something I greatly appreciate as it is left to the player to figure out what he or she would like to do, but could be something others dislike).\n\nOverall, this is a genuinely magnificent game, full of character, humor, and a robust set of play mechanics. Right now there is an absurd sale for this title, and there has never been a better reason to give it a go. One of my all time favorites, I highly and wholeheartedly recommend this game.\n\n","August 19, 2014","true","91.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every time I tried to start it up, it went to a white screen and crashed. I became extremely confused and felt at a loss of 5 dollars, although it's not the money, it's the principle of the matter. Why sell a game that simply will not work? To my surprise, I was not the only one who had ran into this problem. Upon various hours of searching, and attempts to get the game to work, the only option (and very last) was to contact steam support about the problem and recieve a refund. I had then felt discouraged to do so after reading multiple comments from people complaining that steam will not contact them nor deal with the matter.\nThere are no words to describe the disappointment I felt at the time but I did not yet feel defeated, I wanted to know why.\nthe next day later, after reading more about what others have experienced and what they had done to fix the problem, I finally found the answer. There was nothing that needed to be done to the game but search in the folders and start the game from in the "Ghost data" folder, then starting the game by clicking "ghost". You must also have an internet connection and have steam open before starting the game. All along the problem was the game wasn't going to load unless it had a CD to run from. In order to play the game, you must manually dig thorugh your folder. This complaint is not towards the game as it works perfectly fine and is very entertaining and I do reccoment it. I am dissatisfied with steam for selling a game that is not in proper working order and for never dealing with the constant requests for help.","September 4, 2014","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Besides it is an enjoyable game and not an expensive one, I would recommend picking this up along with Evil Genius if you can, that is also a great game.","June 20, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ghost Master is a game which is quite one of a kind. You play as a 'Ghost Master' who is the leader of a gang of ghosts who's task it is to scare the people of Gravenville.\n\nEach level is a parody of a well known horror movie. For example, there's a level called Poultrygeist. The level is set in a house which was built where a slaughterhouse for turkeys once stood. The goal is to free a poltergeist, who looks like a ball of light with feathers foating around it. Other settings range from sorority houses to hospitals to a military base.\n\nEach level has its own goal. Most of the time, that goal is to scare all humans untill they flee the location, or to drive them insane. In more complex levels, you need to manipulate the humans into doing certain tasks for you. Some humans (priests, wiccans,...) will fight back and try to banish your ghosts. You will find trapped ghosts in each level, who are stuck to an object. If you manage to free the ghost by doing a certain task/solving a certain puzzle, they will join your team. Each ghost has its own skills, and you can teach it new abilities following a skill tree. You can revisit each level and try a new team of ghosts and see if you can get a higher score with them. This adds a lot of replayability.\n\nThe best part of this game is in my opinion the sound design. When starting a level, all you hear is some sort of astral choir, singing in the distance. As your ghosts start interfering with the world, the music reacts to their actions. This builds up untill all hell breaks loose, and then, well, you should hear it for yourself. The music is awesome.","February 15, 2014","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I picked it up during a Halloween sale and I'm glad I did.  As another reviewer mentioned, it does remind me of a cross between the sims and evil genius. The first few levels are easy enought trying to scare out the inhabitants to complete the level, but it then becomes complicated with certain criteria you must accomplish during the mission. There are a couple of stages that I had to look up a strategy guide for because what to do wasn't obvious ( a lot of trial and error!).  I also recommend a strategy guide to pick up hidden characters that you would miss if you don't complete certain actions.  I give this game an 8/10 because it was more enjoyable, has more depth and challenge, and comedy than what it appears to have.

Its fun in a qurky Scoobydoo kind of way that seems aimed at more casual players who want a silly and slightly cheasey time-waster, rather then a more hardcore group looking for a good chalangeing game. Unforuntely it's not without its flaws and boy dose it have a lot, nothing game breakingly bad but enough to make a lot of people think twice before buying this game.\n\nYou can tell this game is old as the graphics are really outdated and all the characters talk in the "Sim's speek" version of pig latin while "thought bubbles" with vage pictures in them float over their heads which I guess is suposed to tell you something but most the time I have no clue what I'm looking at till I check the bio. Natrualy once everyone starts telling me what their scared of most of them are already fleeing in bind terror so I have to wonder what the whole point was.\n\nThe Second issue is the frustration factor. The clues droped though out the game are often so cryptic and unhelpful you ether have to replay the same haunt over and over again till you figure out the right combos or just look up the guide which can quickly kill the fun. I'm sure the developers thought they had come up with some clever puzzles but with no real hints and a rather impatient tutorial at the begining I forsee many ragequits. At times the dialog with the traped sprits can come off as a bit lazy as well, like the writers just threw togeather a placeholder statement intending to come up with something better later on, but never did.\n\nAll and all this game has a lot of potential, unfortunately most of it goes untaped but it's still fun to experiment with all the diffrent types of ghost and powers just to see what happens, there's no downside to simply reseting a haunt until you get the results you wanted. If your willing to be patient this game can be a lot of fun, otherwise I'd look somewhere elce. I could see this game benfiting from a reboot.","February 21, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can play it for a good few hours before it starts to irritate me. Then I stop and do something else.\n\nIn short, you own a stable of ghosts and are tasked with haunting an area, either to rid the area of its occupants (in as quick time as possible) or to encourage said occupants to perform certain tasks for you (in as quick time as possible).  In each area there are up to 4 ghosts you also need to rescue. Underpinning this is a 'Ghoul Room' where you upgrade your ghosts abilities, and a revisit function where you are marked on your performance - the highest being a 5x multiplier to your score. Neither of these parts of the game are particularly well done and it is these facets of the game that disappoint. The ghosts you acquire earlier in the game are obviously the strongest as they are the only ones you can use in all the scenarios; and so the Ghoul Room concentrates solely on the 7 or 8 'must have' skills and ignores all the others. Also it is quite clear that Terror is much easier to achieve than Madness, instantly removing a potential 50% of the game. In short, its imbalanced\n\nHidden within the constraints of the game is the concept of the 'perfect' game. i.e a revisit to a scenario and achieving a 5x multiplier plus rescuing all ghosts. This is how I like to play it, but there are two scenarios, "Deadfellas" and "Phantom of The Operating Theatre" where this goal is basically impossible. The latter of those two scenarios, "Phantom" is so annoying that this is where I usually draw the line on a Sunday's play. There is also the concept of 'Luck', if you want to get an Ai to do something for you - sometimes it will, sometimes it will EVENTUALLY. When you are being timed, this is just a little annoying. You can minimize this luck with some astute timing, but some bad AI pathfinding will always exist. Sometimes the AI wont go into a room, not because he/she isnt programmed to, but because its pathfinding abilities have become messed up. The game is not massively glitchy, but you feel that a remake would be better implemented (plus, of course, have better graphics - be ready for some unobtainable chest sizes).\n\nI often wonder how I would remake this game - because there is definitely a game worth playing here - but the only conclusion I can come to is that, although I do have an obvious soft spot for this game, its some way from where it could and should be.","January 27, 2015","true","27.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I saw it on the shelf years ago but didn't buy it at the time (because its from 2002 and I was a dirt poor high school student back then) but I'm glad I rediscovered it.\n\nYou are a ghost master and your goal is to scare the living bejeesus out of all the humans inside a building. To do this you team up with spectres and have them possess various fetters that tie into what they are and what they can do. Some ghosts are simple enough (you have to bind them inside the house itself) while other, more powerful ones require specific fetters (a murderous ghost can only be bound to objects related to violence and murder, like hunting trophies).\n\nOnce bound you can have them do small things like make noises, turn objects on and off, or just give off an aura of fear. As the humans become more frightened their fear will feed your powers and allow the ghosts in your command to do more. From making walls bleed to causing objects to fly around the room to even manifesting in all their horriffic glory!\n\nGet your ghouls and get those humans to ♥♥♥♥ themselves with terror before fleeing into the night.

Instead of  having a bunch of Sims, you have to keep happy and well off, you have a cadre of Ghosts that only exist to keep your puny humans in a state of fear and madness.\nNow, this game is far from perfect: Many Ghost skills lack a precise description, that explain their exact workings, some levels are overly puzzly and if you don't install a trainer, you can't revisit previous levels with unlocked ghosts.\nMany reviews also complain about the fact that humans are eradic and difficult to herd.\nPersonally, I think that this is a rather realistic depiction of people, under the influence of ghosts.\nNow, with all those factors: Is the game still fun?\nYes! A lot!\nIt is all about set up and delivery.\nCalling a bunch of humans into the same room and then springing your best frightener on them is incredibly statisfying. Seeing them run around, driven insane by your phantasm is really funny and using different kinds of frighteners in different situations is really great.\nThere are a ton of small touches, like the descriptions of the humans, that are both funny and may inform you off their unique weaknesses or the desperate and endearing yells of your ghosts, if they ghet exorcised or captured.\nIf you are a person who enjoys to manipulate and overlook, but "The Sims" is just not malevolent enough for you, go and give this gem a try!","September 23, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The act of terrorizing away mortals from their homes is suprisingly enjoyable, and the objectives vary the gameplay nicely. Unfortuantly, the game is short, but each level has immense replay value through trying to unlock new ghosts and attempting to reach a triple pumpkin time. There are also bugs and glitches, but they are rarely game breaking and are not enough to make this game not worth five dollars. Also, this game is constantly discounted to 74 cents, a bargain price for a game of this quality.","December 29, 2014","true","35.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes you need VERY SPECIFIC ghosts to perform tasks, other times your creativity is the limit.\nYou will need to "upgrade" your ghosts with plasm to be able to maximize their performance in game and multitask.\n\nThis is just one of those game for its price you should give a crack at in terms of time, especially for $5.00.\n\nIt is likely that even after you complete the ENTIRE game (it is fairly lengthy), you will probably go back again and see if you can do a better job a second time.\n\nIf you do not mind a challenge, and have a good solid strategy head on your shoulder you should have no problems.\nYou will get a good laugh at the same time and its worth the entertainment.","June 8, 2015","true","23.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Besides it is an enjoyable game and not an expensive one, I would recommend picking this up along with Evil Genius if you can, that is also a great game.","June 20, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Bugs. Oh dear god. i think i had to restart one mission because of a bug that wouldn't let the people find a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ book even though it's on the floor AND right in front of them, the AI can be a bit silly/bad at times and the graphics are kinda dated today.\n\nBUT. However, i would actually reccommend this game, why? Because it's literally one of those games where you can sit back and laugh your ♥♥♥ off on how cheesy/B-Movie it is. from stereotypes to scaring the entire police force (Seriously, thats a mission.). Sure i ran into a few bugs here and there but that didn't stop me, all you do is restart the mission, simple as.\n\nMissions go like this, "Do this and that." BUT the mission you will come across most of the time is, "Scare everybody."\nScare OR you can drive them to Insanity. This tells me you can have alot of fun replaying the missions with the new ghosts you have acquired or try and make them all insane. Which i will admit, was hard at first.\n\nAll in all, i would say this game is an 8/10, good game but a few flaws.\n\ntl;dr\n\n-PROS-\nReplayable Missions.\nCheesy/Narmy.\nVariety in Ghosts you can use.\n\n-CONS-\nBugs.\nCheesy/Narmy.

It's not flawless but offers a great amount of entertainment for many hours to play. Almost all levels can be completed with a variety of different methods, and new ghosts to be unlocked in every level. You can replay the levels you have already completed, to unlock stuff that you may have previously left behind. Level designs have a lot of variety and many possibilities to complete them. It's quite laid back game with no sweating or heavy fustration. but double the fun. Not a new piece but still as great as back in the days it was released. Only real cons I've discovered worth mentioning is the unknown elements in the levels.
