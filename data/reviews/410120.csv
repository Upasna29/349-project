Even though it's 10 years old the story and graphics are still good enough to really enjoy.\n\nHonestly, the controls were the worst part. Navigation was a real task. I prefer straight point and click for this genre. You always have to rotate your view to the right 360 degrees as opposed to going left. It's pretty annoying.  (The controls are greatly improved in later games.)\n\nI originally voted this game down but after playing the later versions and realizing this game is a different animal I had to change my tune. I really dig the deep deep story and lengthy conversations. The details are impressive in this game. Books are filled with information.It's really slow paced but I like that sometimes. This element really wins out over the clunky controls.\n\nGrab this on sale for sure.\n\n**(Edit) I've installed the followup game "Lost Sword of Toledo" Controls are in the same format but so much more fluid. I look forward to a good one there. Check the review when posted.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

The puzzles are creative and not frustrating at all.  The locations in the game feel authentic and the great sounds and music make it very immersive.\nThe game also teaches you to play real "ancient" boardgames as a part of the story.","November 24, 2015","true","6.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

The story is great and well done implemented with puzzles, It's a lot of readings in game. There are many books or peaces of papers to read in the game, but if you like to know more about story then just read it. They are two board games to play in game. They are not to hard to play. Ambiet music is awsome, voice actors are great. The lenght of the game is good, about 7 hours.","May 15","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
