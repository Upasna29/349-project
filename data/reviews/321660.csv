Nothing more, seems like the reviews that talk about deep business simulation are bought. It is not. After 2 hours at the lastest you will be bored. Needs more vehicles, machines and buildings, especially during later stages of a game. Not worth the GBP 16.00, if you really want it, wait til its on sale for a fiver.","December 2, 2014","false","2.6"," 57 of 68 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","57","68","0","0"

Unfortunately I cannot recommend this as a simulator of mining or, if you don't care about mining, a simulator of business. The list of problems is too long to list, but any first year economist could tell you there are a myriad things ridiculously broken in the business model.","November 29, 2014","false","17.9"," 59 of 82 people (72%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","72","59","82","5","5"

The pictures and video are nothing like the actual game. They make it seem like there is so much more to this game but really it is just a glorified econ game that could have easily been released as a free browser game and is about as cheap and low quality as a free browser game. Very little to do but point and click and mindlessly watch the same few backdrops...you really have no control over anything but the purchasing of equipment and selling of commodities. Oh yeah, there are only two things you can mine in this game...Iron and Gravel.\n\nDon't waste your time or money like I did.","January 7, 2015","false","3.1"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","22","29","0","1"

This is not a simulation game.  This is a sit behind a desk and click buttons game to make money.  You don't drive anything, you dont actually do anything.  I wish I could get mt money back.

If you like those type of games, this one is going to be for you and I recommend it.
