I certainly don't think it deserves the current price tag. It has 5 limited levels that are short and your main objective seems to over come the bugs within the game and not the tasks in the level.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmxvVeiUbm4","December 22, 2015","false","2.2"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","24","34","0","0"
