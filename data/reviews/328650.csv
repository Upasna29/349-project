It's all up to you Sir Knight! Time to defend the Kings carrot crop, save the day and possibly win a few hearts.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iaVhVp7feU\nKnight of the Hamsters is more about highscores and rodent genocide fun, then in-depth story or game mechanics. Each level tasked with a simple goal, survival through waves while defending the royal carrots. Killing hamsters rewards gold drops which could be spent on upgrading several pieces of equipment. Shoes (runspeed), Sword (melee-dmg), dagger (range-dmg), cross (magic-dmg) and armour. While treasure chests randomly spawned which contained both health and mana for spells. Day/Night cycles become critical, during the day hamsters require less damage to kill and during night were much more aggressive, so you needed to plan your spending accordingly. Progress further through the game you will come across several boss-like species of hamsters while also gaining the ability the unlock several heroes each with their own unique abilities.\n\nAs someone who plays a lot of platformers I did find the game challenging. Some people this may be a little bit of a turnoff while others will thrive on it. Game did include a family friendly mode which I thought was a nice touch, basically removed all gore and you won every round (while still having fun!) To the developer I would suggest adding a 'normal' mode with simple tweak. 1) Initial waves should have lowered gold costs on upgrades. Would love to see online co-op implemented if viable and the ability to pickup chests or upgrades while moving would be a big plus for all modes.\n\nSimple, clean artstyle which is more then suitable with 200 odd hamsters nipping at your heals. Great soundtrack that really ramped up during the nighttime sequences and very responsive controls, though I would suggest a gamepad else you might get frustrated quickly. Price might be a little high but it's enjoyable so gets my recommendation, Quick pick-up, play while releasing the fury kind of game. Worth keeping shortlisted at the very least. Cheers. :)","April 17, 2015","true","2.3"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","27","33","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/recommended/328650/","TheIronicGamer","TheIronicGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/","1545 products in account","edit: Thanks to the developers recent update improving the difficulty spike of the game I have decided to change the review to positive and have updated my review with changes to reflect my new opinions.\n\nThis game is mad fun! I never expected so much from this game.\n\nAt first glance I thought the gameplay was really standard and was unintuitive. However as I got further through the levels surviving longer it became extremely fun and tense to play. The controls consist of a ranged attack, melee attack and a special ability. The goal of the game is to protect carrots from being taken by the hamsters. The levels are designed really nicely in a way that you need to run about consantly jumping from carrot to carrot to be able to protect them successfully. And then at night time the hamsters turn into zombies and start attacking you. This makes for a nice contrast between the day and the night and instead leaves you running for your life.\n\nThe hamsters themselves have a nice variety of different species/classes that make them fun to fight. You have types such as armoured hamsters, mages or flying hamsters and a tonne more. This variety keeps you having to switch up your gameplay tactics to survive successfully.\n\nThe upgrade system also adds to the gameplay. You are able to upgrade your weapons, speed and armour. These are bought during levels via the coins you earn while playing. It is pretty much impossible to play without using these as you will die very quickly.\n\nUnfortunately this game is very difficult to play at currently with a keyboard. When loading the game you can't even access the options menu with the keyboard from the initial menu as far as I can tell. The game is also flooded with xbox button prompts no matter whether you have an xbox controller plugged in or not.  I wouldn't recommend buying this game unless you have an xbox controller.\n\nThe graphics are not the strong point of the game. Although they do have some very nicely designed character models for the hamsters that I would like to praise. The problem is the textures on things like grass aren't particularly well done. The background on the level select screen in screensot 2 on the steam page does look really nice though. Because of how fun the gameplay was I decided the graphics didn't really matter and could be overlooked.\n\nThe story is another weak point of the game. It is a fairly boring and cliched story. However this is another point that I decided I could overlook due to the absolutely amazing and fun gameplay!\n\nThe absolute highpoint of the game has to be the soundtrack though. This adds amazingly to the experience. The soundtrack is full of a great mixture of tracks such as oldschool video game music and dance tracks. It is truly incredible and a great pleasure to listen to.\n\nSo overall these are my thoughts in summary-\n\nPositives-Great soundtrack\nInsanely fun gameplay\nLarge variety of enemy hamsters\nCreatively designed maps\nUpgrade system\nGood character models on hamsters\nNegatives-Very difficult to use keyboard\nSome textures are not well done\nBoring cliched story\nOverall I would definitely recommend this game to anyone. The gameplay is insanely fun and is really addictive. I myself will definitely be playing a lot more of this game.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system Don't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!\nDisclaimer: I was given a free press key by the developer of the game.","April 16, 2015","true","2.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030616857/recommended/328650/","76561198030616857","jchristiansen00","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030616857/","3 products in account","If old school action platformers with tons of heavy combat (Ghosts 'N Goblins, Rygar, Golden Axe, Wizards&Warriors) are your cup of tea (or in this case, your cup of blood spray and decapitated cute furry heads), you would be crazy not to play Knight of the Hamsters. Such a wondrously frantic melange of platforming, shooting, collecting and straight side-scrolling beat 'em up violence is a breath of fresh air in a day and age where the industry standard of game design is a timid, flavorless experience devoid of challenge and predictable to the point of irrelevance. Cheers to Johnny Death and team for having the guts and vision to put out one of the most surprising, addicting, charming, and unrepentently challenging indie titles I have played in some time.\n\nThe gameplay in KOTH is pure side-scrolling platform combat. As pure as it gets. You will not find a faster, more aggressive action platformer this side of Battletoads and Ninja Gaiden. The play field is a continuous horizontal looping space (think Joust/Pac-Man) with variable height and arrangement of platforms. The looping nature of the field generally works to the player's advantage, allowing some very nice flow and freedom of movement as well as a chance to evade attacks and/or escape hordes of onrushing Hammies when necessary (and make no mistake--regardless of how aggressively you play, it does at times become necessary to flee before the inexorable Hamster onslaught). The looping play field also throws a few more subtle curveballs into the gameplay; for instance it is possible to swat enemies through the edge of the screen to set them up for combo attacks, and certain projectiles can pass through the screen boundary as well which results in some really interesting attack moves depending on which character you are playing.\n\nSpeaking of characters: the Proving Grounds offers a host of heroes that can be recruited to your cause using coin accumulated in battle. Even in defeat you are awarded a nice stack of gold that can be used to unlock new characters with ever gnarlier Hamster-grinding abilities. I will not spoil them here... Go unlock them and see what they do! Each hero is as delightful and charming as he is deadly, and each one (with the exception of the red/blue Templars) is completely unlike any of the others. My personal favorite is Headless... but honestly there are no weak links--every character is fun to play, and they are all suitably unique with their own distinct fighting styles, special attacks and perks (critical hits, "holy" strikes that turn nocturnal devil-Hamsters back into their docile daytime forms, and probably a lot more that I haven't discovered yet).\n\nUpon first entering a stage only a few Hamsters appear, usually the weakest varieties... This is your chance to move around, get the lay of the land, and note the positions of the all-important carrots (defensive objectives that must be protected at all cost, lest you fail the mission in disgrace). During the day the action revolves around evaluating your situation (health, number of coins), protecting the all-important carrots, and grabbing up a key powerup or two before the sun goes down. The gameplay dynamic shifts drastically as day phases into night... Demon-Hamsters now ignore the carrots and spawn in massive waves, attacking from all sides and bouncing unpredictably around the field when struck by attacks (which makes it tough to target them accurately for a quick finish). Jump attacks and a mix of range/melee strikes work well, as does moving strategically from platform to platform, but the night time is basically a non-stop fight for your life as you pray for the crow of the rooster and the rosy light of dawn.\n\nCamping in one spot and just mashing buttons rarely works for long, and even if you do survive that way you will have a tough time collecting enough coins to power up... The ability to simply hold a button down for rapid fire ranged/melee attacks is a welcome convenience, but for those of us NES generation players who pride ourselves on our ninja-esque thumb speed it is possible to unleash even more death by tapping the buttons with astounding celerity. Do not mistake KOTH for a mindless button-masher! A fair amount strategy, insight and quick decision making is required to survive and conquer in addition to lightning thumbs of blazing devastation. Some of the missions last 5 or even 7 days, so consider carefully which powerups you choose to unlock, when to buy health, when to release your special magic attack, etc. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention--the coveted powerups will be destroyed if you carelessly attack them (yep, just like the food in Gauntlet), and health chests spawn at random positions all over the field. A devilish little twist of design if ever I saw one... You are a cruel man Johnny Death. :)\n\nThe way jumping, shooting and melee attack actions combine in KOTH is probably my favorite thing about this game. Even in the first few minutes of play I was switching fluidly between ranged attacks and heavy slashing, throwing down crushing aerial combos and unlocking powerups on the fly. Defeated Hamsters release precious gold coins that are literally your life blood in battle. They are good for ranged/melee/armor/magic upgrades, and are also required to unlock treasure chests (full of delicious health) and revive fallen comrades. So the player is faced with a crucial strategic decision: spend coin to get better weapons (and, ideally, stay alive by killing enemies before they kill you), or use it to recover health you lost in the current day (and prepare to face an even gnarlier wave of demon Hamsters without any increase in power)...\n\nHave I mentioned that these levels are hard? Well they are. And I for one respect and appreciate this fact. Yes KOTH is a challenging game, and yes you may die a few times before clearing a level... For me personally, this is a quality that is pretty much necessary in order for a game to hold my interest. If there is no real penalty for failure/death that means there is no real challenge, and thus not much reason to keep playing. To make things even crazier, some levels include various "devices" you can spend a small number of coins to activate--things like explosive barrels, ballistae, and spiked crushers (think Castlevania/Contra). Like most things in KOTH, using these is a gamble--a barrel that you paid 5 coins to detonate may yield 10, but if you aren't able to collect them right away you may find your coinage running short when you are in dire need of unlocking a chest of health...\n\nI have only really scratched the surface of the gameplay in Knight of the Hamsters, I could go on and on and on for pages about all there is to discover in the Carrot Kingdom... The Treasury, with its plethora of "quests" (challenging secondary objectives)... The Royal Zoo, with its vast menagerie of captured Hamster specimens... The Castle, with its ever-evolving cast of NPCs and mysterious potions for sale... The secret room where all the Carrot Princesses seem to be throwing a rave for the invading Hamster forces (yes this really exists--but good luck finding a way in)... Such a great game overall, and I have such profound respect for the skill and creativity of the designer. This really goes to show what a small team of highly talented and motivated creators can accomplish.\n\nSo in summation: if you fancy a rough and rollicking frenzy of cute, cuddly ultra-violence, tarry not noble sir! Knight of the Hamsters is 30% off until 4.22.2015... Buy it now, and perhaps we shall meet again one day on some far away fur-strewn field of glory. Bold heroes of the Carrot Kingdom, sharpen your blades and steel your nerves. The twilight is at hand...","April 17, 2015","true","14.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

If you have a keyboard only try and play with the keyboard and mouse as the developer has freely admitted that only using a keyboard could be a bit difficult.  This is also the way they prefer to play and the way I shall try in the up coming days.)\n\nWhile I will admit that the game does admit that this is a game meant to be played with a controller, this is only made fully clear after buying the game or reading this point here.  My personal problems with the game could be fixed in a single minor update as trying to play this game on the keyboard was HIGHLY hostile as I found my fingers contorting just to make sure each finger was on a useable button.  This could be fixed with Key bindings being alterable and shouldn't take much effort.  Second is that even if you are playing on the keyboard that it will still tell you to use controller buttons in order to play the game.... Really helpful...  Just ten minutes to add in a /X symbol next to the game controller option.  Finally this one doesn't need to happen but I think everyone can agree, while local co-op is nice for the computer I'd much rather prefer online co-op.  (It's still nice we get any co-op of course.)\n\nAgain everything being said this is all things I disliked playing the game with a KEYBOARD!  If your able to use a game controller (Or keyboard and mouse) for this then you should find no trouble and this game would be worth about 6-7 bucks I'd say.","April 30, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"
