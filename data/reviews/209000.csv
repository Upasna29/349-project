If you're not a die-hard fan, make sure you've played Arkham Asylum and Arkham City before this, and if you are then still hungry for more Batman and can't wait for Arkham Knight, consider getting this only on a good sale.\n\nLong review\n\nArkham Asylum was great.\n\nArkham City was even better, even though the story did get convoluted at times just to fit in all the content.\n\nArkham Origins... is just something to tide us over until Arkham Knight is finally released.\n\nIf, like me, you are a massive fan of the Arkham series, it's likely that you've already bought and played Origins, so I don't need to review it for you. If you are someone who merely liked Arkham City rather than playing it to death, and who's wondering if you should pick up Origins: probably not. You've already seen (almost) all the gameplay there is in Arkham City, and done better at that. Yes, Origins has a bigger map -- but it doesn't manage to fill that map with sufficiently interesting stuff, so that, paradoxically, it somehow feels smaller than Arkham City. Yes, Origins adds a story that qualifies as a prequel (even though, in spite of the title, there is very little there that could be called an origin of anything), but it's ultimately inconsequential.\n\nThe story is both better and worse than City. It definitely has more focus than City, which started off simple but had an incredibly convoluted build-up to the end, certainly compared to Asylum. By contrast, Origins simply has Batman targeted by a bunch of assassins because Black Mask put a price on his head, and most of the story is just Batman taking them all down in order. There's one thing that could be called a twist, but it happens pretty early on, and actually (and unfortunately) makes the story less interesting since we trade a new villain for an old one. But with the increase in focus also comes a loss of depth, and there's nothing in Origins that compares to the daring ending of City. True, Origins hardly has room for something like that given that it's a prequel, but more could have been done with the premise. As it is, most of the characters you encounter in Origins undergo no development -- Batman included.\n\nThe gameplay is definitely worse, in both small things and bigger things. There are glitches where Batman can get stuck or enemies suddenly stop registering as enemies and just stand there looking goofy, ground takedowns seem to work only when they feel like it, and sometimes necessary encounters simply don't happen until you leave an area and come back. Mind you, this is with all the patches and fixes that are likely to ever be applied -- this is as good as it gets. It never gets so bad that it makes Origins unplayable, but it's just not as polished as City.\n\nUpgrades are now partially tied to achievements in the form of the Dark Knight system, and this manages to do little more than unbalance things. The fatal flaw of this system is that it requires you to do certain things in order, so unless you're carefully keeping track of what exactly you're supposed to do next, you may find yourself short of an upgrade you want with no easy way of getting it, or doing something silly you've already done dozens of times in the game which only now counts as an achievement. I spent the majority of the game without the "disarm & destroy" move because you can only get this if you complete a side mission that's extremely easy to miss until you've already finished the story (and in fact it doesn't unlock until a good way in). And if you haven't completed the Predator track by the time the story finishes, well, it sucks to be you because most achievements can't be completed for lack of appropriate Predator encounters. This is all the more galling given the fact that Arkham City actually had respawning Predator encounters, even though you almost certainly didn't need it.\n\nThe Shock Gloves are an upgrade that's not tied to achievements but part of the story, and they deserve to be singled out as a bad idea. When you have this, after enough punches, you unlock the use of this "super gadget" that allow you to punch enemies that normally couldn't be punched, and counter things that normally couldn't be countered. Rather than making fights more exciting, however, it just makes them less interesting because you don't have to think about how to take on enemies as much anymore. Activating them is optional, but also very easy to do unintentionally. I would have given good money if I could have traded the Shock Gloves for the disarm & destroy combo... but that's not an option.\n\nThe side missions are uninspired. Detective investigations are back in the form of case files, which is a neat idea but they're far too simplistic to hold the attention for long -- visit crime scene, rewind things back and forth until you've scanned the things that obviously need scanning, then go somewhere else to apprehend the perpetrator. The data packs you collect this time (replacing the Riddler trophies) aren't half as interestingly protected as the trophies. It makes some sense since, after all, the Riddler isn't even calling himself the Riddler yet, but if that's what they were going for they should have just reduced the number of them and saved you the tedium. There are no surprise encounters that lead to interesting diversions like in City; you'll pretty much hit all the spots during the story and what's left is collectibles and endless "crimes in progress", which are just repeated brawls. There's too much copy and paste like this and not enough memorable stuff.\n\nIf it sounds like I'm doing nothing but comparing this game to Arkham City: that's because Origins all but invites the comparison, since in both premise and execution it's just like Arkham City. If Origins could be judged on its own merits, perhaps in a universe were Asylum existed but not City, it would come out much more favorable -- but since City does exist, the game can't be seen as anything more than what it is -- a repeat exercise. It's a good repeat exercise, mind you, and it does actually try new things even if those don't always work out for the better. The developers should be appreciated for their efforts, but the spark of genius is missing. Origins ticks all the boxes, it includes all the stuff that City did and adds some more besides, and yet somehow it manages to do less with it.\n\nOh, and there's multiplayer. That is definitely new, but it's also the one thing I can't say anything about, as I haven't tried it. This is not a shortcoming of Origins, by the way, I'm just a solo player. And we are talking about Batman, after all, who does his best work alone. If you need to know if the multiplayer is worth it, you'll have to look for another review.\n\nDo I recommend Origins? Yes, as long as you get it on a good sale. It would be unfair to say Origins adds nothing to the Arkham experience, and as much as I've criticized it, I can't call it a bad game. But it never rises above "competent" when compared to Arkham City, and I just can't see myself playing it again to complete the "new game plus" mode, as I did with City (twice!) The only reason I'm even tempted to do that is because of the third mode you can unlock -- "I Am the Night", which requires you to play the entire game yet again, without dying once. Now that's an achievement -- but it will be a while before I can bring myself to sit through the game again, and by that time, Arkham Knight may well be released.","December 29, 2014","true","109.7"," 287 of 311 people (92%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","92","287","311","24","7"

I just can't recommend it since its basically a copy/paste of Arkham City but buggier and made with little understanding on what made Asylum and City great.\n\nTL:DR? See CONCLUSION\nINTRODUCTION:Batman Arkham Origins is the third instalment to the Arkham franchise. Although the original Arkham Games were made by UK based developers Rocksteady, this game (Arkham Origins) was made by Warner Bros. Games Montréal with Rocksteady acting merely in an advisory capacity.\n\nThe story takes place roughly 5 years before the events of Arkham Asylum, in a time where Batman was only 1-2 years into his career as a superhero and is highly regarded as an urban myth. Play as Batman and fight for your survival because Black Mask has offered a $50 Million bounty on your head. Defend against the assassins, put Black Mask behind bars and uncover a new mysterious and dangerous villain calling himself, “The Joker”\n\nPROS:+ Good Story which has a lot of great moments. Recognized as canon by Rocksteady\n+ Improved and Challenging Boss Fights (although not all *cough* Electrocutioner)\n+ New Enemy Types (the Martial Artist thug is a fun new addition)\n+ Voice Acting by Troy Baker (Joker), Roger Craig Smith (Batman) and all of the voice actors did exceptionally well. Not the best, but for 'younger' versions of the characters they did well.\n+ Substantial amount of side missions (although very poorly paced)\n+ Visit the Batcave and Alfred\n\nCONS:- Copy/Paste of ARKHAM CITY\n- No innovation or change from Arkham City in terms of combat mechanic\n- No innovation or change from Arkham City in terms of gadgets which are still basically the same with new names but does the same thing\n- Bigger Map but somehow very boring and has a fair amount of glitches\n- Annoying screen flicker effect while reading\n- Severe Performance drops because of excessive use of PhysX and poor optimization\n- Unnecessary Multiplayer to a game which was clearly intended for a Single Player experience\n- Too much Combat and only a few (and easy) Stealth missions\n- Too much characters which resulted in less screen-time for each of them\n- Too much sources of Exp that results in fast level ups which results in...(see below)\n- Too much upgrades that removes the challenge in both Combat and Stealth play (Electric Gloves)\n- Bugs, glitches and errors plague the game, still unpatched because the devs said that they were focusing more on the DLC than fixing their game\n- Limited Batman Costumes\n\nCONCLUSION:I would RECOMMEND this game for people who's in it for the STORY, otherwise, Its best AVOIDED. If you were expecting innovation on the gameplay mechanics, smooth frame-rates and with a properly paced progression, sorry but you won't find it here.\n\nWORTH IT?:NOT Worth a full price purchase, best bought in a SALE.\n\nRANT (Not necessary for the review):There is a saying which goes: “Too much of a good thing is BAD”, Arkham Origins is a prime example of it. Too much Combat made it repetitive and a chore with not enough stealth, Too big of a map that made it boring, Too much upgrades that made the game easy, Too much villains that resulted in little screen-time, Too much PhysX effects that caused FPS to tank badly, Too easy Riddler challenges, Too much attention to DLC while ignoring multiple bugs and glitches and many many more.\n\nI just can't recommend it since its basically a copy/paste of Arkham City but buggier and made with little understanding on what made Asylum and City great.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/recommended/209000/","deathbomb1","Dirk Dickbutt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/","389 products in account","Batman: Arkham Origins is a prequel to Arkham Asylum and a sequel to The Land Before Time.\n\nYou play as a younger and less handsome Batman, when he was just starting his career of ILLEGAL vigilantism and his parents were slightly less dead. But still very dead by normal human standards. The game takes place on Christmas eve, a time for celebration and also a time when the diner turns on its heater in the alley and I can be warm at night. A man called Roman Sionis,  Negrodomis aka: the Black Mask and totally the main villain for the entire game has hired several assassins to come make Batman like his parents for the low low price of 50 million Vietnamese Dongs. These villains include Bane, Deathstroke, Deadshot, and several villains you've never actually heard of.\n\nThe combat is much the same as it was the last two games, only with a few more features, such as electric gloves that also double as a nifty way to power your cellphone. Much like a microwave. It also adds a few new enemy types, such as discount Jet Li, and roid-monsters. But old enemies return as well like the random mook, and of course those creatures I am deathly of: girls.\n\nStealth is pretty much the same, only this time you also get an upgrade to your spider-man web in the form of a gun that allows you to strap people to gargoyles so you can wrap them up and suck out their juicy goo like the evil man-spider you are. You awful, awful monster.\n\nThe collectible riddler side-mission returns, only this time it reminds me of my high-school years: long and heartbreaking. The riddles and Batman trivia is gone in favor of collecting datapacks that I spent more time doing than I care to admit. There are also these invisible icons left behind by some chump called Anarky, and much like the gay agenda, they are everywhere.\n\nThe game itself is rather jarring compared to the first two Arkham games. While Rocksteady made a rather loving tribute to the Dark Knights in comic and cartoon, Arkham Origins feels much like the movies, taking many assets from the Dark Knight trilogy and clashing themes together much like the skin tone between me and my African twin. Though you can use one of the many skins for Batman after you complete the game, most of them tend to not fit with the theme the game is going for, so you're left out like a DnD nerd at a Fantasy Football meet up.\n\nThe game also gives you the option of playing as Deathstroke in the challenge maps, a character that is rather easy to beat even on the hard difficulty and only shows up maybe twice through the entire thing. And even then, he's just a re-skin of Robin from Arkham City. So you're basically just playing as Robin during his rebellious teenage years.\n\nThis all being said, would I actually recommend Batman's third crusade through the streets of Angsty Metropolis? I guess, if you liked the first two. The side missions are unfulfilling and the Riddler missions make me want to rethink my life choice as a professional street Luchadore. But the game still held my attention for longer than I care to admit, and I still like to look at Bruce's chisled jaw and amazing abs.\nThat still doesn't make me gay.\n\n6/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarylSurat/recommended/209000/","DarylSurat","DarylSurat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarylSurat/","776 products in account","Arkham Asylum was a revolutionary game. Arkham City was as well. By contrast, Arkham Origins is viewed as an evolutionary game, and between that and the fact that the principal actors and development studio have been replaced a lot of people figured "eh, I don't need to play this for a year." Technically speaking, Arkham Origins does feature revolutionary additions over the previous games, but it's in an area that nobody particularly asked for in the first place: online competitive multiplayer. I myself have yet to even launch it, but given that it's developed by Splash Damage I'm sure it's not slapped together. They did after all make the Return to Castle Wolfenstein multiplayer (which got carried over into Enemy Territory, and then Quake Wars, etc).\n\nThe thing about the single-player is that while it's good, you literally cannot help but compare it against Arkham City the entire time. The combat system and animations are completely carried over, with some additions. You have some new gadgets (one is allegedly "new" but in reality is functionally identical to something else from Arkham City) and face a few new common foes. Luckily, one of the gadgets is straight out of Super Inframan and makes combat even more satisfying since you trounce everyone with it, and the others give you more options during the Predator encounters. The enemy AI is altered since the rate at which you counter rather than strike has gone way, way up. Boss battles are VASTLY improved over the previous games, as each one emphasizes that you do different things. At no point do you feel "well, this is the same thing I did for the last boss."\n\nBut even with that said, at most points you DO feel "well, I've done this before." Aside from the combat, the sidequests have you doing the same gameplay mechanic as 2 years ago (and 4 years ago) albeit for a different cosmetic reason. Example: in Arkham City you have to quickly travel across the city to answer phones in time to stop a killer. Here, you have to do the same to defuse bombs. It's the same map as Arkham City, albeit with some new zones. It helps a little that you can now fast travel. But there must be fewer grapple points because getting from place to place is a little trickier than it used to be.\n\nYou'll be fighting and fighting, and with the random "crimes in progress" that spawn, you'll fight more. You're rarely going to be scanning the environment unless you're prompted to do so. Crime scene investigations are a new addition, but much like the show CSI you aren't really doing anything yourself. The computer is magically reconstructing a series of events based on your having scanned a body and a spot of blood (which they can't show as red). Then you go beat up a guy. You can't inadvertently defeat the person you meant to interrogate either, so there's no "save this guy for last" aspect to combat. But you are now given grades for each encounter, such that higher grades yield XP bonuses. Winning is largely a foregone conclusion given that you're Batman, but winning with an A or S rank is the tough part. In fact, I still haven't gotten the last one because it doesn't always play the *wham* sound effect to denote you KO'ed someone with a hit (I call this the "BATMAAAAAN!" since if I could mod this game I would replace that sound with the screaming pug). The game offers various challenges for additional bonuses and upgrades, but it's buggy about deciding whether or not some of them "count." I busted my ♥♥♥ doing the "do 4 exotic takedowns in a Predator section" and then it didn't count it. And then it turned out there were no more Predator sections in the game. AND it won't let you complete those challenges on the challenge maps, so if you don't do it during the story you're screwed...unless you replay it on the much harder New Game+ mode...\n\nThe reduced architecture grapples and increased enemy attack rates are somewhat minor, but if there's a major "step backwards" here it's one of atmosphere. This Gotham City isn't yet overrun with supervillains who've marked their territory and themed their gangs. The incentive to see the world isn't really as strong. The Riddler's challenges were designed to direct you to all the cool little references, but at this point there is no "Riddler" etc so you're basically completing the challenges for the sake of hearing the "extortion data that's going to harm innocent people" recordings. Except pretty much all of them pertain to supervillains and corrupt civil servants whom you take down anyway. It feels more like a task since there's less "reward" for doing it. Why oppose this so strongly? That's the REAL enigma.\n\nThe strong negative online backlash to Arkham City's criminal dialogue means that EVERYTHING pertaining to threats or abusive language is long gone (that already got walked back since the Arkham City DLC) so pat yourselves on the back, Team Social Justice. Between that and the fact that Batman is less infallible at this stage of his career, the writing has gotten a lot more praise compared to Arkham City. But for me, it feels less satisfying to beat people up because I overheard them saying they're cold and hungry, or that they're resorting to crime because they lost their job and now they have to not be home on Christmas Eve. This definitely plays into the "Batman as fascist authoritarian conservative" reading of the character. I kind of wonder if the writers just hate Batman as a concept, since the villains all expose the flaws in his approach and morality and Batman has no answer because he can't admit "the reason I can't kill you is because you're all too profitable as IP."\n\nAlso, the game takes place over a few hours on Christmas Eve into Christmas Day, yet the amount that happens is absurd. True, a lot happened during Arkham City, but there was planning leading up to it. How can these locations be THIS devastated and re-renovated in just a few hours? And it's not even accidental; the game points out "yeah, it's been 3 hours." On the other hand, James Gordon isn't Commissioner yet, so the cops are pretty much all dirty. In this game you get to beat up SWAT team guys, which is the part of "Year One" that is the most important.\n\nThe Assassin's Creed guy as Batman has his highs and mids since he's mostly forced to imitate Kevin Conroy, but with a name like "Roger Smith" you'd think he was BORN to impersonate Kevin Conroy's Batman! Troy Baker (who already nailed his Richard Moll Two-Face impersonation in Arkham City) is about as dead-on a mimicry of Mark Hamill's Joker as one could hope, given that Mark can no longer really do that voice anymore. Richard Epcar (voice of the Joker in the fighting games) has a few background lines that jump out to me, but I guess he also directed a lot of the secondary dialogue recordings.\n\nI enjoyed Arkham Origins, but I'd still say to hold off on getting it. Not so much because of the issues described above so much as the fact that there's a ton of DLC and all of it's spread out across platforms and retailers due to exclusivity (Challenge maps where you're Bruce Wayne in training, etc). There's a Season Pass which includes that stuff, but it costs another $20 and for now is almost entirely cosmetic. They say there'll be at least one story DLC, but what'll it be about? Maybe something inspired by The Long Halloween? I don't know, so I don't know if that, a few challenge maps, and some cosmetic skins are really worth the money. For now I'd say to pick this up once a "complete edition" is available unless you happen to buy a new video card that bundles it.","November 26, 2013","true","49.7"," 417 of 521 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","417","521","0","13"

While most of them look exactly like a thinly veiled attempt at getting you to part with your hard earned cash there are some that are genuinely enjoyable or good fun in small doses. However, the general consensus carried by most is to just avoid them completely and if you must pick them up - grab them when they are in the bargain bin a month later. I realize this can be an excruciating thing when you have been a life-long fan who refuses to give up hope that your hero will finally feature in something worthy of his heroic stature and stop slumming it with the shallow money men and celebrity hand-holders.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=260967665\nRocksteady, taking cues from Frank Millers version of The Dark Knight, were finally thankfully able to put down a title that not only did the source material justice but also expanded upon it in its own unique ways. Batman: Arkham Asylum was also one of those rare licensed-based games that ended up being a winner as the tormented and battle-scared Batman went head to toe with his nemesis du jour, The Joker. If you have not yet taken the time to play Arkham Asylum I implore you stop reading right now and go install, play and finish the game immediately before returning to finish reading this. With an incredibly well written and engaging story (that acknowledges the lore and back-story of Gotham City and its characters) it featured gameplay that was incredibly fast, dynamic, enjoyable and fluid. It even faithfully recreated a Gotham Universe many immediately identified with. It looked like Rocksteady, a then little know company that developed the first and second game, were on hand to give the fans of Batman a game most wanted to see him in.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=253772811\nFor the third installment all is not so clear on the (Gotham) waterfront. With Warner Bros. Montreal taking over the reigns from Rocksteady, Batman's worst enemies though are not the assassins lying in wait to claim his head for their bounty prize but the bone-crunching and back-breaking bugs the game was released with and in most cases still suffers from (like your save game getting corrupted which forces you then to restart and has been an issue since day dot). This time around the adventure suffers from a severe case of uneven pacing and you will often find this new Batman veering from one charged encounter to a Batman that looks like he is about to fall asleep on his own two feet. Batman: Arkham Origins introduces us to a much younger Batman who is more prone to sudden aggressive outbursts on the one hand and on the other hand in danger of almost turning into a small-town private-eye rather than the bright-lights-big-city crime and punishment enforcer that he actually is.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=260947748\nEven fighting against seven of his deadly comic book nemesis is not nearly as exciting as it must have sounded on paper with some of these boss battles not even registering a 1 on the boss-battle meter which has the unfortunate effect of turning most of them into a non-event. Once again the game is played from a third-person perspective and focuses on Batman's combat and stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets for combat and exploration. Batman: Arkham Origins is also the first game in the series with multiplayer capability. However, a lot of the areas covered in Arkham Origins honestly feel like a cut-and-paste job from Arkham City and the more I played the more I began to feel like this was ground that had already been well covered.\n\nI really wanted to love Batman: Arkham Origins and while there is indeed a lot to love (the combat is as fluid as ever) and some of the areas you get to explore like Madhatter's Domain are exceptionally creative but it all gets bogged down by the hit and miss plot and gameplay on display, some seriously dodgy bugs that almost a year into release have still not yet been fixed despite being know about and then the usual sandbox favorite - lifeless, boring and generic altercations with the cities criminal underbelly. If Rocksteady is to continue in this vein with The Dark Knight I sincerely hope they look to Arkham Asylum for more inspiration as I am not so sold when it comes to the open-world sandbox versions.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","May 18, 2014","true","45.1"," 310 of 389 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","310","389","4","20"

Boasting a strong narrative, an expansive and atmospheric open world, and all the classic gameplay elements from the earlier titles, it is just about everything one might traditionally expect from a sequel.\n\nCampaign: Released by ‘Warner Brothers | Montreal’ in late-2013, ‘Arkham Origins’ is the third game in a series that revolutionized the super-hero Action-RPG genre and it does not stray from type. A prequel, set five years prior to 2009’s ‘Arkham Asylum’, it features a younger, more vulnerable Bruce Wayne, one still largely unknown to the citizens, criminals and constabulary of Gotham. The opening credits detail a mysterious break-in at Blackgate prison by local crime-boss ‘Black Mask’ who subsequently announces an open bounty of $50 Million dollars for the masked vigilante’s (Batman’s) head, drawing some of the world’s deadliest assassins to Gotham. An engrossing, well crafted campaign of twists and turns will take you across a broodingly atmospheric and expansive, open-world, filled to the brim with side-quests, collectibles, and cold-cases, amongst a veritable who’s-who of criminals, psychopaths and super-villains.\n\nGameplay | Graphics | Sound: Gameplay is from a third-person perspective, aligned around the game’s 4 main pillars of Flight and Stealth | Combat | Detective Mode | RPG elements (of character upgrades and customization), and these are largely unchanged from the well developed mechanics from earlier entries in the series. Besides the XP-based upgrades to obtain new armor, skills and weapons, a challenge system tasks the gamer with accomplishing targets of scaling difficulty to unlock new takedowns and abilities. ‘Origins’ also introduces two new gameplay features - 1. Crime Scene Investigations and 2. A Multiplayer Component - ‘Crime Scenes’ is an innovative concept triggered at various points during the campaign wherein you are tasked with studying a crime scene, and identifying ballistics, DNA and forensic evidence in an attempt to recreate/solve the incident in a mini-game format. While novel, it is unfortunately somewhat shallow in implementation and thereby predictable, and has to count as a real missed opportunity in driving the series’ gameplay forward. Multiplayer features the ability to play as Batman, Robin, The Joker and Bane as well as various gang-members in a good variety of game modes which while completely serviceable, again seems largely tacked on and unnecessary. Finally, completion of the main campaign unlocks higher difficulty challenges with ‘New Game Plus’ and ‘Worst Nightmare’ modes, and good visuals, strong voice-acting and responsive controls (for both K&M | Controller) round out a well designed, feature-rich offering.\n\nFlaws: Quibbles include average graphics and poor textures in areas, stuttering framerates in others, and a confounding inability to grapple freely onto any surface during flight – a seemingly general lack of the ol’ spit and polish, and a sense that this is more ‘Arkham City v1.5’, than an entirely new game.\n\nOverall, ‘Batman: Arkham Origins’ succeeds in maintaining the legacy of the ‘Arkham’ series by capturing the essence of what it means to be the Dark Knight – be it through brooding atmosphere, an exceptionally strong narrative, a who’s-who cast of villains, a fun and effective combat system, fantastic boss fights, varied gameplay elements and all the toys and gadgets one would expect. Yes, it is iterative and quite similar to ‘Arkham City’, but keep in mind that it stands on the shoulders of two nearly perfect games, and fans of the series should enjoy it thoroughly nonetheless.

This is the third main game in the Arkham Series which has been running since 2009.\n\nGameplay is basically the same as any other of the Arkham series of games. The same fluid and easy to grasp combat system is still the same, allowing you to string together some serious combos; I’m talking sometimes in the regions of 2000+! On top of the combat system, Batman comes prepared with his arsenal of gadgets to help him fight the bad guys, with plenty of returning favourites like the batarang and claw, but also some new additions such as Shock Gloves, and Concussion Detonator. Normally in past games, you are able to get by most situations without having to use too many of your tools, but you have a good range of moments throughout the main story to use everything here.\n\nSomething else which has been introduced is a fast travel system, since Gotham is so big, you really do need to take advantage of the fast travel system, but you can only use it once you take out certain control towers to free up the signal in that area. Another really welcome addition to the game.\n\nAfter just completing the game about an hour ago, I am honestly finding it difficult to think of any aspect of the game play that I did not enjoy. I thoroughly enjoyed Arkham City and this really quenched my thirst for continuing the series.\n\nGraphically whilst it was one of the latter big releases of the last generation of games, the game does look really impressive. I couldn’t quite push out the game on 4k resolution but was able to play at 1440p without any problems and it just looks gorgeous. I particularly like the snow effects in game, along with the really impressive textures across Gotham.   The game is run using the Unreal Engine 3, so you can expect some really good looking scenes in a well fleshed out environment.\n\nThe game does present some fairly tricky boss fights, each has their own style and way of beating them which is different from the last. If you want to get your combo streaks really high, you have to learn your combination attacks, and flow your counters and attacks together almost perfectly. It took me a while to get it down perfectly, but the rewards are certainly worth it when you can get combos of 500+ on some fights.\n\nWhat the past Arkham game and this game really focus on, is the open world aspect of the Gotham. Yes you have the 10 hour long main story, but a lot of the game’s content comes in the optional side missions and tasks. There are a number of other well-known bad guys that you can take on and aim to take down. These can be anything from destroying chemical containers to disarming crates of weapons.  Whilst they mainly a lot of “follow the quest marker” style missions, they still have their own story and resolution which defiantly makes them worth your time to complete.    As you can see from the amount of hours I have been playing Origin’s, there is an awful lot of content to see and experience, and I would highly recommend people take the time to do so.\n\nI didn’t have any technical issues whilst playing. I wasn’t running the game on SLI, purely off a single graphics card at 1440p with all of the settings maxed out. The game runs smoothly at 60fps without any glitches or stutters. This is a game I would strongly advise you play with a controller, given the way the Arkham style combat system works, you get the best movement and accuracy from using a controller over keyboard and mouse unfortunately, but it does play very well on a Steam controller.\n\nIn conclusion, I honestly can say Arkham Origin’s continues the trend of action packed and fun to play Batman games up to this point in the series. This game has often been criticized for lack of content and originality, I say they aren’t all fully true as there is so much content in this game, and why break something that’s not broken? Batman Arkham Origins is definitely worth the regular retail price of £14, 99 but you can get it a heck of a lot cheaper if you wait for sales. For me, this is a must play Batman game.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

In fact I was dropped into Blackgate Prison with such little fanfare and context that it almost felt as if I'd jumped back into Arkham City by mistake.\n\nThis was after all the same Gotham I had run through before, familiar architecture giving way to reflexive movements honed over my time with the first two Arkham games. All of Batman’s high-tech toys were still with him, disrupting Origins’ prequel status though at least allowing my to skip collecting them for yet a third time, and by and large everything would appear to be in its rightful place eager for another excursion into Gotham’s criminal underworld (though by now I’m willing there’s a warrant out for at least 90% of the city’s population).\n\nBut, therein lies the problem doesn’t it. That for whatever Origins’ is itself, it’s the third of its kind in five years, and what was once revolutionary is now mundane and ordinary. Arkham Asylum came out of nowhere as one of the best games of 2009, and easily the best Batman game ever released. Arkham City soon followed, blowing the series up into an open world and bringing with it some welcome improvements to Asylum’s mechanics, even if that came at the cost of being rather bloated with content it didn’t have any idea what to do with. So where does that leave Origins’ to take the franchise?\n\nWell, it doesn’t really take it anywhere. Origins’ is alarmingly similar to the games that came before it, only without enough confidence to carry itself well enough to at least be comparable to them. Which, OK, it’s being handled by a new developer so perhaps some rough edges are to be expected as a new team attempts to take over the Arkham series until Rocksteady is able to finish their next game. But Origins’ failings extend beyond minor bugs or the occasional bad level design, into an overwhelming feeling that this is all just busywork to keep people busy until the “real” third Batman game arrives. And that makes it hard to appreciate Origins’ on its own merits, when even it seems to have accepted its role as a filler game.\n\nIt feels sloppy and rushed, in little and big ways that snowball into one another as the game seems to progressively care less and less about how it eventually turns out. Combat is identical to past games using the same attack/counter freeflow system, but it fumbles over itself far more often than in past games. I was constantly having combos break when I was attacked from off screen or had the camera fail to center on the next enemy, slipping up on counter timing that never felt right, or just having attacks fail to register properly as Batman shuffled in place as confused as I was. Encounter designs enhance these issues by popping up constantly and having no focus or balance to them. I was tossed into rings of dozens of guys with random weapons or armor, and these weird combinations made it difficult to create any kind of rhythm in the combat because it was constantly being broken by a random enemy with a knife or a car door or some other special attribute that might pop up once or a dozen times during a fight.\n\nThe Arkham fighting system is one of my favorites in any game, but less than halfway through Origins’ I was already becoming annoyed anytime I walked into a fight and knew even if I played perfectly I was still at the mercy of the game doing what I told it to do. There is a lot less stealth in Origins’ than either of the past games, which was at first disappointing until I finally arrived at a predator mission and then wished they had been omitted entirely. City had already began to stumble a bit in following up Asylum’s impeccable level designs, but Origins’ up and throws in the towel right from the start with levels that are both far too complicated yet feel significantly less tactical than past games. There are still grates you can hide in and gargoyles to hang from, but levels never account for your need to quickly move from cover to cover as you close the distance between you and a guard and just haphazardly place hiding spots throughout a room with no thought as to how you might use them in conjunction with one another.\n\nEvery stealth section felt like I was the one who was trapped, rather than the guards I was hunting, leaving me scrambling to take them out as soon as possible instead of anything more methodical and coordinated. I died more times in Origins’ than I ever did in either of the past two games, and it almost always was because I had attempted to takedown an enemy in any way other than hanging upside down and waiting for them to walk underneath. These sections became very boring almost immediately, when previously they had been my favorite parts of the Arkham games.\n\nMaybe this is simply the result of being spoiled by Rocksteady’s games, but Origins’ doesn’t exist in a vacuum and even seems to assume to player will already be familiar with the formula. It doesn’t bother to explain mined gargoyles or enemies with sonar goggles, because if you have played City you already know how they work. It’s entirely aware of its heritage, so treating it as a self contained work feels pointless and disingenuous. It doesn’t feel like a step forward for the series though, being closer to b-roll content cut from City rather than something original.\n\nWhere the Arkham series had the most ground to make up though, and where Origins’ even had the capacity to do so was its narrative, and to its credit this is far and away the most engaging and cohesive plot the series has ever known. The cast has been trimmed down from City’s over indulgent buffet of characters, which allows Origins’ to spend more time developing them into interesting, complicated characters I wanted to know more about. Many of the assassins called in to collect a five million dollar bounty placed on Batman’s head don’t get as much time as they deserve, but they’re compensated by a far deeper, disturbed Batman who is still early in his career as a vigilante and less prepared to face the villains he’s after. At times his sense of justice and methods for carrying it out border on sociopathic, a side of him that’s not lost on those he comes in contact with and which eventually comes to a head as he is forced to come to terms with whether or not his actions are actually justified.\n\nIt’s familiar ground for Batman as a character, but its a part of him I never grow tired of exploring and which brilliantly accompanies Troy Baker’s fantastic performance as The Joker. I thought I was ready to be done with the deranged clown, but the interactions between him and Batman are so compelling I simply wish Origins’ didn’t take so long getting to them, upon which it quickly changes the subject again. The narrative as a whole is still inconsistent, but it’s Origins’ one true advancement for the series which I hope will be continued with future Arkham games.\n\nI have a hard time flat-out calling Arkham Origins a “bad” game, but it’s saved almost solely on the strengths of what has been brought over from past games (and then butchered) and carries with it a very qualified recommendation to anyone but the most devoted fans of the series. This is still an Arkham game deep down somewhere, with some exceptional characterization that sadly isn’t given enough time to shine, and by now the rhythms of the series have become so natural to me that it wasn’t difficult to get into a simple groove and fly through the game despite how unimpressive it was. I guess what I find most unpleasant is just that in only five years and three games it already feels like Batman has already shown us all he has to offer, and I’ve only reruns to look forward to in the bi-annual future.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","June 15, 2015","true","15.2"," 98 of 112 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","98","112","5","10"

I still hate the boss fights, but love taking out rooms of enemies without being detected and  gliding around the city finding things. Maybe one day we'll get a Batman game that offers the Dishonored approach of multiple ways to complete objectives, but until that fantasy comes true, this is good fun.\nEdit: After finishing the game, I can say it feels more tedious than Arkham City did. The combat's not as smooth, and I think it's because there were some changes to the button combinations for special attacks, although it's been awhile since I played AC, so I might be remembering incorrectly. There are also numerous small obstacles that for unknown reasons you're unable to step on/over, which really throws off the flow of moving around the city. I mostly used fast travel, once it was unlocked, because they made travel by running, grappling, and gliding too much of a pain. Finally, there are several small bugs. Nothing completely game breaking, but I had to reload a checkpoint on at least three separate occasions because of n enemy getting stuck somewhere I couldn't reach, or the option to interrogate not triggering.\nOverall, still worth playing if you loved the previous games, but if you weren't completely sold on them, this will be even less fun, and should be avoided.","October 31, 2014","true","34.1"," 116 of 139 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","116","139","0","0"

The combat is, as with City, untainted - fully intact, with few new gimmicks thrown in to distract from the centerpiece of kicking and punching. The stealth, too, is more or less the same - though, the level design is much worse, a problem that basically infiltrates every corner of Origins. Essentially, Origins is the same song as Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, played by a cover band. You can still groove to it, and occasionally the new guys have something interesting to add, but it's not the original - it's a copy, and an inferior one. But it's the same tune you hum along with and tap your feet to.\n\nIf the game weren't incessantly buggy atop of its design flaws, I'd say it's a worthy little sequel, especially at sub-$15. As it stands, the PC port is chaotically awful. It's dropped below $5 and I'd wager that's all it deserves, but that doesn't mean you won't have a fun time.","November 3, 2014","true","19.6"," 116 of 140 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","116","140","5","0"

I just can't recommend it because, in its current state, the game is a bug-riddled mess. I myself did manage to beat the game, and I enjoyed (almost) every minute of it. Fantastic game. When it works, it is definitely the best Arkham game out there, but I can't, in good conscience, recommend a triple A, 50 dollar title that doesn't work for a major portion of the playerbase. If these bugs are fixed, the game's an easy recommendation. 9/10 game. Phenomenal. Incredible atmosphere, incredible gameplay, and the best writing in an Arkham game (sorry Paul Dini). But right now, this game, in its current state, simply cannot be recommended.\n-------------------------------------------\n\nBatman: Arkham Origins is one of the best examples of a fantastic game riddled by bugs. Great story (probably the best in an Arkham game), and great gameplay marred by atrocious problems. Bugs so far include a bug that prevents people from launching the game, game crashes (preventing the game from being completed), and keyboard/mouse control problems (where you can't land critical hits). There are even reports of people being unable to attack! Some bugs are minor, like Batman jerking up and down while gliding (kind of funny, actually). Overall, I can't recommend the game, in particular because of the gamebreaking bugs that can occur.\n\nGameplay-wise, the game is great. It's not as good as Arkham City, because of major balancing issues with certain gadgets. For example, the Remote Claw is incredibly overpowered in Predator missions. Painfully overpowered, because of the Remote Claw Takedown, for example. It's basically a ranged, silent, inverted takedown. The Electrocutioner Gloves, in combat, grant you 2x per punch (3x per crit) on your Combo Counter, and can punch through shields/armor/stun batons, allow you to counter any enemy attacks. The gameplay is fun overall though. The new Crime Scene feature is cool, even if it holds your hand. The new gadgets do prove for interesting gameplay.\n\nIf you're gonna drop $50 on a game, it better damn well work, and right now, WB Games can't guarantee even that. If you can run it, I promise you that you're in for a damn treat, but there's a relatively high chance that you can't.\n\nUPDATE: There are reports with people having issues booting the game still, a whole month after release. Sadly, this is unacceptable. I can't comment on the multiplayer for the game, as I've only played 3 or 4 matches. In terms of multiplayer problems, I've heard that after the recent update, player levels got reset without warning. Also, I was able to beat the game without encountering anything gamebreaking, but I also know that some of my friends can't even launch the game in its current state -- some FATAL ERROR OZZY thing. It's quite saddening, really.\n\nUPDATE 2: I want to expand a bit on the graphics and sound design of the game, since I barely touched on it. The game runs rather well on max settings (apart from PhysX), using DX11 features at 1920x1080 on my setup -- with an i5-3470, and an AMD Radeon HD 7950 -- specifically between 40 and 80 frames per second depending on the area, it's perfectly playable, and it looks good for a game working around the limitations of Unreal Engine 3. The visual and sound design in the game together is absolutely amazing. It was good enough to make me believe it was Christmas, if not just for a moment in October. Roger Craig Smith, and Troy Baker are absolutely fantastic at reprising their roles as Batman and the Joker respectively. Brilliant stuff.\n\nUPDATE 3: Aaaand Warner Bros has no plans to fix Arkham Origins bugs, apart from some keyboard/mouse functionality with Deathstroke challenge missions. ...Maybe.\n\nhttp://ca.ign.com/articles/2014/02/10/wb-games-has-no-plans-to-fix-numerous-glitches\n\nUPDATE 4: Critical Hit on KBM bug was fixed some time ago, not sure when.","November 25, 2013","false","28.9"," 468 of 660 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","468","660","0","10"

The action buttons are almost entirely the same, which was nice since I didn't have to learn an entirely new system.  There is a ton of content, we still have The Riddler as a background story, there are many optional side-quests and distractions, but it felt like there were *too* many distractions in this one.\n\nIn Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, I never lost track of the main storyline, despite my frequent forays into side-quest territory.  Not so with Origins.  I can't count how many times I came back to my computer with absolutely no idea what I was supposed to be doing.  It felt aimless and repetitive, even when I was working towards a side-goal.\n\nOne of the things I REALLY enjoyed about the first two games is the riddles we had to figure out.  Oh we still have two hundred data packs to find (the predecessor to the Riddler trophies we saw in Asylum and City,) but no actual riddles to figure out.  I really missed them, and the data packs simply don't hold enough of my interest to make up for the lack of riddles -- I'm not even going to try to get them all.\n\nThe in-game achievements would sometimes work, most times not.  I literally flew from one end of Arkham to the other, and never got the flying achievements.  It took four or five tries to get the notification that I'd taken down two criminals in a slide.  Just frustrating.\n\nBesides the irritation of not remembering where and what I was supposed to be doing, there was also the frustration of not being able to grapple places that clearly should have been accessible.  It was very obvious where we could and couldn't grapple in the previous games, so I don't feel like it's asking too much for this third game.  We DO have a quick-transportation option, which is nice, but I still would have liked it to be clear where we could and couldn't grapple just by looking.\n\nThere *are* some improvements over the first two games.  For instance, when we are locating the "extra special" criminals (those holding information we need, etc) we don't have to save them for last in order to get the information.  If we want to, we can take them out first, then go back and interrogate them when the fight is over.  Another improvement is the crime scene investigation.  They've really added an element of interest to it, though in my opinion, they underutilized it.\n\nOrigins is clearly the inferior product game-play and story-wise, but I still recommend it for fans of the series.  It was interesting to see how the back-story emerged, and I'm glad to have played it.  Next time, though, I'll know to skip a lot of the side content and concentrate on the main storyline.  I think that if I do that, I'll enjoy the game much more. :)","July 12, 2015","true","46.9"," 65 of 70 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","65","70","5","7"

Currently stuck in a void and no amount of restarting or changes will fix it and thanks to the single save auto-saving system, there's no way to revert to an older save... This is clearly the sort of thing that should be found in QA. Now I have no choice but to restart the whole game. So, if you desperately want to play this game, just be sure you know there are many game breaking bugs that can completely wipe out your save. It's like playing Russian Roulette with your time.

Different studio on an Arkham game means a different aproach, which in this case turned out to be a solid job. The gameplay is now brutal, there are more gadgets, the city is bigger and colder, the story feel more alive and the soundtrack helps making it all epic.\nThe STORY is well written, has many epic moments and does it job at keeping you entertained and keeping your interest in, which is great considering it's a prequel. In this game, Batman is in his early days, fighting both criminality and law. In the night you're playing, 8 assassins mean to kill, all organized by the man behind a mask. There are characters like Joker, Bane, but new, even unheard ones from the past games, like Deathstroke, Firefly, and Shiva. The main story is great and the sidequests are a joy to do(only there you'll confront some of the assassins)\nThe GAMEPLAY is brutal, fun and challanging on hard. Having more gadgets and moves keeps things fresh for an Arkahm veteran. There are regular thugs, armored thughs, brutes, martial artists, thughs with shields and armed thughs and there is a gadget, a move for each one of them. You have the dark knight system, which challanges you to do different things and gives you rewards which consists in upgrades and experience. The challange room is fun to play, but it should be approached after most of the upgrades are aquired. There is also a new game plus and new to the series, "I am the night" mode, which is the ultimate challange.\nThe MULTIPLAYER is totally enjoyable. There are some things that tie in with the singleplayer, but aside from that, you can play as Batman or Robin, or you can be part of Joker or Bane's gang. Being a hero means intimidating both gangs, before they one kills the other and captures every point. You can even play as Joker or Bane, if you are the lucky thug to open the door for them.\nGRAPHICS are stunning, the game being the best looking Arkham to date. Also the texture models are a real eyecandy. It has the innovative thing of snow getting deformed at your movement, which is something available for every type of video card.\nThe BUGS are solved now, haven't experienced any, but a crash while hitting the exit button. Gamebreaking bugs are solved now, but there are still some to report some problems.\nAll in all, Batman Arkham Origins is a great game that does it's job of making you feel like Batman, a must own for every gamer, since right now it's the great game that you can enjoy.

Interactive Entertainment\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nArkham Origins is the third game in the Arkham series, and is a prequel to Arkham Asylum. It's also developed by a different team from the other games. Overall it still retains most of the features from the previous 2 games, Asylum and City, but it's noticably different. It's still the same great gameplay you'd expect from Batman and the Arkham series, and it every bit as good as the other titles, despite the differences.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nArkham Origins plays largely the same as Arkham Asylum and Arkham City did. Batman still has all his gadgets, in addition to a few new ones: the remote claw, the shock and thermal gloves, the disruptor, and the glue grenade...just to name a few. He can still grapple around the city and glide everywhere he goes. He can still throw the most beautiful punches and kicks you've come to expect from the Arkham series, with a few fresh new moves. Despite being from a different developer, Origins pretty much looks and feels exactly like an Arkham game should. WB Montreal did a really good job at implementing the battle system, UI (for the most part), and experience systems we've all come to know and love. Once you get into the flow of the game and in a good stride, you'll forget that a different studio made the game. It's still an Arkham game, and for the most part it still has all the features and mechanics you'd expect. Combos, Takedowns, gadgets and environment interactions...it's all here.\n\nOne of the biggest things Origins adds to the formula in this entry is the Crime Scene Scanning and Rewind features. When presented with a crime scene, Batman goes into evidence scanning mode. As you scan pieces of evidence scattered throughout a crime scene, the events are slowly pieced together bit by bit, until eventually what happened at the crime scene can be played back with complete control. You can fast forward and rewind to specific moments of the crime to help locate hidden pieces of evidence. These scenes are spread throughout the game, and help to offer a sort of puzzle element to the game.\n\nQuite possibly the most useful feature added in this installment is Fast Travel. Scattered throughout the city are radio towers under enemy control. Once liberated, these towers serve as Fast Travel Points. At anytime while outside in the city, Batman can call the Batwing to come pick him up and drop him off at any of the unlocked radio towers. This is immensely useful in getting around in such a large city.\n\nYou still have your usual fare of side quests and Riddler challenges, and quite a bit of your time will probably be spent doing these.\n\nBatman: Arkham Origins is the first game in the Arkham series to include multiplayer. Unfortunately it did not appear to last long. I went into Multiplayer Mode at least a few times and only saw about 2-3 people online hosting their own games. It's safe to say that multiplayer is dead. That's too bad, as going head-to-head with other players in different modes would have been a blast for me to try out.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nThis entry in the Arkham series looks just a tad different from the others, but it looks great. The city is what really shines here. It's Christmas Eve in-game, so it's snowing all over the city. One of the details I noticed is if you are on a snow-covered rooftop, Batman leaves footprints in the snow everywhere. These didn't fade away after a few seconds like in other games, but they do go awat after an area transistion though.\n\nGotham City is dark. Secrets are hidden everywhere. All character models are sharp and extremely detailed. Batman still gets tears in his cape and damaged spots on his body armor as the adventure progresses.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nThe biggest thing you will probably notice in this area is that Origins features a different set of voice actor for the main characters. Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill are not reprising their roles of Batman and the Joker in this entry. For hardcore fans, this may be a turn-off. The voice actors they have sound really close though! The soundtrack is, again, the kind of fare you'd expect from Batman. Dark, dramatic, ambient. The kind of music that sets a dark mood fitting for Batman. The kind that says 'Don't mess with the Bat'.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nIn all my hours of play, I didn't run into a single performance issue. The game ran at a near flawless 60 FPS at all times, even during combat with many enemies on screen or when I was zipping around the city using the grapple gun. I also used a controller the entire time, and it felt so responsive and intuitive. I had zero issues doing everything with a controller.\n\nOne small gripe I had was with the online aspect. When you boot up the game, it automatically logs you into your WB Account (once you sign up for one, which gives you a bonus skin for Batman btw), before going to the main menu. At a few different points the game got hung up on the logging in part. It took me switching Steam to Offline Mode to start playing again. I don't know if this issue was due to the WB servers being down or what, but I could not find anything pertaining to it through at least 20 minute of Google searching and the few minutes I spent scanning the game's news and updates section on Steam. Apparently others have had this issue a few times over the past couple of years.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nArkham Origins is every bit as good as it's predecessor. It's what we've come to expect from the Arkham series. It still puts you right into the shoes of the Caped Crusader and offers a unique experience and an original story. Very well worth a purchase, and it belongs in every fan's game catalog. Expect a great single player campaign full of twists and turns, plenty of combat scenarios, and lots of detective work. Expect...Batman!\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GRQfixbWDc\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nHighly Recommended\n\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","July 31, 2015","true","28.6"," 57 of 67 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","57","67","4","6"

They're flashy and feature impressive scripted sequences, but really just amount to being pixel hunts. They're kind of representative of AO as a whole.\n\nPeople praise AO for its writing a lot, and I'm not really sure why. If I had to guess, it's probably because AA and AC were the trademark kinds of turds produced by Paul Dini post-2000, and because of its really, really flashy setpieces. Batman falls from a skyscraper punching the Joker, with the most impresive graphics the franchise has ever seen, which looks great - but winds up being the beginning of the game completely abandoning its "EIGHT ASSASSINS! ONE NIGHT! PAY FOR YOUR SEAT BUT YOU'LL ONLY NEED THE EDGE EDGE EDGE" hook before it could even be a third of the way finished.\n\nIt's downright impressive how many things this game ripped off from previous Arkham games. A surprise section where you play as a different character was console-exclusive bonus content for another Arkham game, animations copy-pasted and all. Shock gloves (which instantly trivialize any and all combat) are just the super mode from the Wii U version of Arkham City. Mad Hatter is here, for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason, and he's got yet another hallucinogenic trip to send Batman on. Etcetera.\n\nWhen the gameplay isn't stolen, it just doesn't work. There's still bugs with the Concussion Detonator (which is basically worse than AC's REC in every way) breaking combo constantly, due to the delayed nature of its explosion. Batman will occasionally just outright fail to counter enemies, and a lot of animations that were cancelable in AC aren't in AO. The island is the most lazy expansion I've seen on a previous open world, with areas broken up into segments that are broken off by either a hilariously long bridge where nothing happens, or massive buildings that you inexplicably cannot grapple or climb. Martial arts enemies don't add variety as much as they add busywork, and the bosses are a huge step back from even AC's basic Zelda-esque bosses.\n\nIt's probably the prettiest game in my Steam account, though, and the challenge rooms are still a great time. It's worth $7.50 if you REALLY love the Arkham games, but it's the weakest entry so far, and you'd be totally fine by just replaying City's challenge rooms and waiting for Knight to hit instead.","November 25, 2014","false","53.4"," 190 of 291 people (65%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","65","190","291","12","0"

It seems to have more negative reviews and scores compared to the Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, and there are a few reasons for it, but in a lot of ways this one seems better too.\n\nThis game has some bugs and some people might have certain performance issues.  As far as I can tell, that is what most of the negativity comes from.\n- The cutscenes (not the cinematic ones, those are fine) can be pretty laggy.\n- I've had weird glitches with my cape while flying.  While not gamebreaking, it will definitely ruin your immersion.\n- I had some lag issues while fighting the very lovely female Copperhead.\n- Many people have had a bug while fighting the end boss that doesn't allow you to counter some of his attacks.  Because it is a quick time event fight, this will keep you from progressing.  The only way to get around this, is to reduce your resolution by quite a bit.  Why does that work, I don't know.\n- I've had some people that I needed to interrogate, where the interrogate option would not work at all.  I relaunched the game and then it was fine, but we shouldn't have to do that.\n\nThis game is still great though, even if you do encounter these issues.  Besides that it ran smoothly for me.  The base game is tons of fun.  It is a prequel to the previous Arkham games, where Batman is somewhat new to Gotham.  Assassins have been hired to kill you.  You don't really have any friends aside from Alfred.  The cops are after you just as much as the assassins and the gangs are, and other enemies besides them as well.  There is DLC for this game that has a story centered around Mr. Freeze as well which is quite cool (ha...ha...ha...).  The map is very large, and there's quite a bit to do.  Aside from the bugs, this is great, and you can pick it up at fairly cheap prices when on sale.\n\nThe game also has a multiplayer mode that pits Batman and Robin, the Joker and his crew, and Bane and his thugs all against each other.  It's a lot of fun.\n\n"You may be the world's greatest assassin, kiddo, but Joker always gets the last laugh!" -The Joker","November 3, 2014","true","29.6"," 50 of 66 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","50","66","3","0"

The second one was a bit too ambitious, throwing you into the deep way too soon. Arkham Origins fortunately doesn't do this, but it doesn't hold your hand either, which is a good thing. But the city is a bit too similar to Arkham City, and yes, even though it is Christmas time, it also feels way too empty, with hardly a civilian to be found anywhere and empty cars standing on the middle of the road.\n\nThankfully, there's plenty of content, with lots of sidequests and collectibles and a beefy storyline. Just like the other 2 games. And there's more than enough variety as far as the villains are concerned. Just like the other 2 games.\n\nAnd, of course, there are plenty of gadgets. ... Just like the other games... Sure, there are a few new ones but most of them work the same way as some of the gadgets found in the previous games (like the glue gun).\n\nGraphically it all looks amazing, with that dark Batman vibe dating back to Batman Returns on the SNES. The voice acting and music are also all very solid and gameplay wise it all works very well.\nIt's just that Origins doesn't show enough innovation. It all feels and looks very similar. They should really try and expand the game for possible sequels. Give us something new, something to get excited about.\n\nAnyway, you will, once again, get plenty of content for your money by buying this. That's also not the thing that you should be worried about. The thing is, can you look past its flaws and enjoy a game that's basically Arkham City 2.5 ?\n\n[Rating: 82/100]","December 8, 2013","true","20.9"," 82 of 122 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","82","122","0","3"

Different studio on an Arkham game means a different aproach, which in this case turned out to be a solid job. The gameplay is less good, there are more gadgets, the city is bigger and colder, the story feel more alive and the soundtrack helps making it all epic. The story is well written, has many epic moments and does it job at keeping you entertained and keeping your interest in, which is great considering it's a prequel.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astring/recommended/209000/","astring","every bae is halloween","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astring/","4251 products in account","The short summary: no matter how you feel about Asylum/City, this game is pretty much just a couple of good boss fights surrounded by warmed-up leftovers from City. Skippable.\n\nThe long version: the game begins pretty strong, and having one of its best boss fights early (hi Deathstroke) was a really good foot to lead with, but that's basically the peak of things, and it's kinda downhill from there on. Almost every bit of the game just feels like a lamer Arkham City, and some of the city actually seems to be directly copied from the last game, or real close. (It feels to me, and I have not reinstalled to check, like there are less grapple-points in the world. Which makes travel sorta lame even before the story-gated fast-travel checkpoints.)\n\nSimilarly, the combat has a couple of steps up (I enjoyed remote-clawing things onto people as an extra layer), but these come early and then you're out of new tricks for the back half. In another "was it always this way? I swear not" moment, a lot of encounters take place in the-seams-are-visible invisible boxes. More than once I tried to start an encounter with a gadget or trap and then discovered I had clawed or bataranged a man into a wall that kept him from actually moving where I wanted. (Try it sometime!) The enemy 'groups' are strangely seperated. I would occasionally beat up two of three men on a roof and get rewarded for the fight, while the other stood there oblivious because he wasn't part of the same team.\n\nThe prequel conceit also hamstrings the game really, really hard. On the one hand, kudos for going "heck with it, he's going to get new tricks and we don't care that they aren't in the other games". On the other, the barely-reskinned stuff that shows up in here but is telegraphed from miles away (looking at you, "glue" grenades that still come out as blue platforms...) if you've played the last games is lame, and oh my god there are too many batarangs. You have seperate multi-target batarangs. That's a real design decision someone made. And to circle back around: you throw in a bunch of villains you haven't used in other games and then expect us to believe that three dudes who all show up in every other game are in danger? For god's sake, at least fake us out with someone we KNOW isn't going to appear 20 more times.\n\nSpeaking of design: this game is buggy. I only had it crash to desktop the once, but the volume just FLATLINES randomly on area-swaps, at times I had to restart the game because triggers stopped working/responding, and at least once an entire encounter had to be redone because a man fell through the world. This is apparently miles better than the game at launch, as friends pointed out to me, but man, it's not what I call excellent.\n\nI don't recommend this unless you're really, really hard up for some more City-style action but don't want to replay that, and even if so... maybe just save a few bucks up by not buying this and put it towards Arkham Knight? I mean, there's still the chance that could be a debacle, but at least it'd be a much more interesting debacle than this rehash of a title.","March 20, 2015","false","33.7"," 167 of 271 people (62%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","62","167","271","12","12"

Otherwise, in a nutshell, the game was a huge disappointment and, in my opinion, wasn't even worth 5 bucks. I truly wish I could get a refund.\n\nNOW THE REASONS WHY:\n\nFirst off, the game is extremely glitchy/bugged, which tells me that the company/developers behind the game put out an unfinished and/or untested product on the market, probably because they were in a hurry to get their money.\n\nThe fact that I couldn't even get through the first boss fight (which doesn't even take that long to get to ingame) without experiencing an almost game breaking glitch is just pathetic honestly. The fact that the glitch was SO BAD that the music was disappearing, Killer Croc was turning invisible, and then shortly after that the screen went black is probably some of the worst glitching I've seen in a while. The only fix was for me to have to lower my resolution and FX JUST TO GET THROUGH THE FIGHT. Might I mention that I left my settings the same for the rest of the game and had no problems, and this is a well known bug on the internet forums, some people stating they still couldn't fix it, so I'm one of the lucky ones. This is just one game breaking glitch among PAGES UPON PAGES on internet forums that you should probably take into consideration before even bothering with this crappy game.\n\nNow, I'm a person who owns and has played/beaten the other Arkham games, and I can honestly say that the controls and combat are way slower/stiffer/clunkier than the predecessors. There were times where I was going to pull my hair out because the game would alter my settings without me knowing and would invert the camera angles, or my character would activate a gadget I didn't even have selected which would cost me in a fight.\n\nAND FYI, the company behind the game hasn't bothered to fix these glitches at all and from the sounds of it they've practically abandoned the game by now so there won't BE any fixes unless you want to do the freakin programming yourself. BUT OH WAIT IT GETS BETTER\n\nYou can't access the ingame built in console (F10) in the vanilla version of the game xD *facepalm*. Wow. So good luck fixing the game. I'll get back onto this subject in a bit, but lets move onto the next issues.\n\nSecond, if you're a  batman nerd and know your batman trivia, this game is going to drive you insane, especially on the chronological level. The writing for the game was terrible and in my opinion put a number of the characters in situations or saying certain things that I personally felt was not accurate for their character development. Gordon would NEVER be willing to send his men into a dangerous situation, KNOWING Firefly has the bombs set up and threatened to blow up everyone but the vigilante, simply just to SPITE Batman because "I follow the law and you don't". Batman would not destroy the Gotham christmas tree simply to be a jerk to a petty insignificant criminal for no necessary/logical reason, especially if he's just starting out as the vigilante and trying to send a message for people to NOT BE JERKS ANYMORE, what a concept. Batman would not simply let Penguin get away because he locked the door, especially considering the WHOLE freaking game has Batman asking Alfred to unlock doors for him. Guess he couldn't be bothered to open one more door. Batman would not simply let Black Mask get away simply because he was fighting an assassin. The moment Batman would get the antidote, he'd be on Black Mask faster than you could say salsaverde. I could go on and on, but you get the idea. Yet later, after Joker is arrested, they play off like Batman's GOT to find Bane and finish arresting him. Oh, so you NEED to finish the job with Bane but who cares about Penguin and Black Mask right?\n\nALso, let me point out that there was hype for this game having a new villain created for it. This villain is called Anarchy, and from what I gathered, he's basically like the Punisher or an extremist, etc. etc. They play off in the beginning of the game when you beat penguin that he's gonna be this big pain for Batman, and it got me thinking that maybe Anarchy was the joker or something, whatever we'll find out eventually right? NOPE. Turns out that I still don't know much about Anarchy because HE'S NOT EVEN CONNECTED TO THE MAIN STORYLINE AT ALL, HE'S A FREAKIN SIDE QUESTLINE. A side questline which I will never finish because I have no desire to play this game anymore. Lovely.\n\nNow keep in mind that because I was so annoyed with this game, I hardly did any of the side quests at all. I managed to beat the main storyline in (according to steam) 11.6 hours. Honestly, even though the story modes in the other games weren't too much better, at least the game was fun enough to make it seem like it had good replay value and fun to engage, while this game leaves much to be desired.\n\nThe actual storyline, for up till Joker gets arrested, actually seemed like there was potential. It kinda had me going for a moment, wondering what WAS going to happen. But after the Joker gets arrested, the story becomes a mess where for some reason Batman HAS to find Bane over everyone else, finds out that Bane somehow knows his secret identity, he temporarily kills alfred, and then for whatever reason goes to Blackgate prison to join up with Joker JUST to play some stupid mind game with heartmoniters and trying to force Batman to kill someone, ALL OF THIS MESS seemingly just to give meaning/purpose to the use of Electrocutionors gloves, which might I add is one of many devices they give Batman in a PREQUEL that he doesn't have in the SEQUELS, gee great to know the staff behind this crap game REALLY cares about continuity and staying true to the true origins of batman *note the sarcasm*.","November 29, 2014","false","11.6"," 55 of 82 people (67%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","67","55","82","9","2"

Sure, there are a few minor glitches and the design isn't as polished as the other Arkham games, but it was still loads of fun and the story kept me coming back. Speaking of the story, Origins' story may be the best story in the Arkham series and is definitely the best thing about this game. The writing is phenomenal and serves as a fantastic origin story to the Arkham series. I immediately bought Roger Craig Smith's portrayal of a young Bruce Wayne. Although Troy Baker's Joker took a little getting used to due to my obsession with Mark Hamill's Joker, Baker's Joker grew on me and I now love him (almost) as much as Hamill's Joker. Additionally, this game easily had the best boss fights in the Arkham series up to this point.\n\nDon't let this game's reputation as the worst Arkham game stop you from buying this game.

Unlike arkham knight boss battles, this installment brings back the feeling of what its like to fight actual bosses who could kill you if your not too careful for example bane, deathstroke, cooperhead and others.\n\nMultiplayer	The multiplayer in this game is also good. There are 3 teams Jokers gang, Bane's gang and batman and robin .You get to play as one of the elite henchmen who work for either the joker or bane and you get to play as batman and robin, sort of like a predator/prey system where about 6 players are henchmen(prey) and 2 players are batman and robin(hunter). I like how the mutiplayer gives you the opportunity to play as henchman and get to experience their perspective of being stalked by batman, you maybe thinking how hard can it be to spot a man in bat costume or even be scared of him but trust me after playing as a henchmen you will FEAR THE KNIGHT.The drawback to multiplayer is that its really hard to find a match when there aren't many online players, each matchmaking session takes about 10-15 minutes which is abit frustrating and things get even worse when a game starts with people who are either afk or disconnected during the match since there is no vote to kick feature and players can't join during multiplayer sessions.\n\nThis game may not be as good as arkham city but its still worth buying and playing.

It takes place around 5-years prior to Batman: Arkham Asylum and features Batman going head to head with 8 assassins sent by Black Mask. Not only are gotham's most dangerous assassings out to kill you, but the Gotham City police are trying to apprehend you, so you are alone. As with previous Batman games, the perspective is third-person, with all of the usual gadgets and tricks. For those who enjoy multiplayer, there is a multiplayer version of Arkham Origins as well.\n\nDuring fights I felt like the perspective would roll around to much and it was a little distracting. Gameplay is essentially like the other Batman games, and visually, it looks and feels like Arkham Asylum with a few differences made to the interior of the prison.

The media reviews of this game are incredibly biased and bashes everything based on the fact that it is not made by Rocksteady. If the game changes too much, it is unfaitful, if it doesn't change, then it is uninnovative. There is no pleasing of the media dogs.\n\nThis game kept everything that made Arkham City amazing and added upon it. Here's a list of pros and cons that I've experienced during the game:\n\nPros:\n1. The new detective vision allows far more interesting interactions with crime scenes and now actually requires effort to solve a case.\n2. Fast travel is now available to compensate for the larger city\n3. Superior story telling. This game tells a fantastic story of Batman's  beginnings and lets you see into the internal struggles of Joker. In terms of story and character presentation, Origins well surpassed its predecessor.\n4. Much improved graphics including higher texture resolution, dynamic lighting and ambient occulsion.\n5. Far more optimized than Arkham City for the PC, better performance overall\n6. More gadgets provide more ways to terrorize your enemies\n7. More complex city geometry with multiple layers\n\nCons:\n1. Bugs. Even though bugs still exists, they are more or less small glitches that are less likely to be game breaking. Of the 20 hours of gameplay there have only been 1 time where a bug actually got me into trouble.\n2. Factial animation. While most of the characters have impressive facial animations, for some reason a few characters just never got the same effort put in to them. Gordon and Alfred talks without ever moving a facial muscle, which feels quite creepy...\n3. Somewhat shorter in length compares to Arkham City, less side quests and shorter main story.\n4. Grapple lock feels less accurate than its predecessor, aiming of your grapple can be a serious issue when you are trying to do some fast swings.\n\nOverall I am incredibly pleased with the game, if you still have doubts, pick it up after it goes on a steep sale, which is likely to happen soon due to the relatively low sales figures...","March 11, 2014","true","18.3"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","24","31","0","1"

If you're looking for more Arkham, then by all means don't skip this game. That's what I was looking for when I started Origins, and I wasn't disappointed. I consider this game superfluous because it really doesn't do anything better than Arkham City. Indeed, in some cases it's pretty lacking.\n\nAnd now for the long review:\nThe story to Arkham Origins is...well I'll be vague here. There's a bounty on the Dark Knight's head and eight villains are looking to collect. It's up to the player to put a stop to this nonsense and save the day. The pacing and story are a bit uneven, with a number of segments feeling like they're not really going anywhere. There's a distinct lack of great set-pieces, those moments that really define the Batman experience. That's not to say there isn't any, but they tend to get clumped together. It's like wow give me a chance to breathe here. There are even a couple objectives that seem to exist, solely to make sure Batman is in a particular place, so it doesn't break the next objective. Still the story definitely has its moments, the characters are well-done, and by the end I had a good sense of what WB Montreal was going for with the plot.\n\nNext up there is the city. On one hand I like that unlike Arkham City, Gotham doesn't have The Riddler's ????? fetish on display around every corner. His trademark riddles are around, but they blend in a bit better with the surroundings. It's less guady, which counts for a lot. There are some nice details throughout the city. Overall though I can't say I'm too fond of it. Arkham City's..uh...city is more stylized, which is understandable since its villainous inhabitants have dressed it up to fit their personality. Still, I was expecting something a bit more gothic and ornate. There are elements of that and yet sometimes the city can look just plain. Aside from the aesthetics, Arkham City simply had a better design and "flow" to it. It felt like more time was spent creating a slice of Gotham that the player could really move around in. Origins on the other hand, can feel just a little bit clunky.\n\nThen there is the combat. The Arkham games are divided into two styles of action. There are the melee-oriented "Vigilante" brawls and the stealthy "Predator" rooms. The goal is typically to defeat all the bad guys, with better experience rewards doled out to stylish players who take advantage of Batman's numerous abilities and gadgets. WB Montreal has done a fine job with both styles. In some cases the brawls aren't quite as tight, and I've had some odd dropped combos, but nothing really stands out as poor. Predator encounters are pretty much 1:1 with the previous Arkham games. There are also the occasional boss-fights, which can take elements from the core styles, or be a little unique.\n\nNow then, the big complaint I have with Origins is that they didn't really add anything new. There are a handful of new gadgets for handling Batman's foes, but nothing really inventive. There's the shock gloves sure, but they're ridiculously strong. They chew through every possible defense and add to the combo multiplier at a rapid rate. As fans are well aware, successful vigilante is constantly changing things up, using all of Batman's maneuvers, and keeping a flawless combo going. The gloves simplify things a bit too much. Batman also gets a few new gadgets for his predator encounters, including the ability to string up three criminals to gargoyles from a safe distance. They're not nearly as overpowered, but I have to restrain myself just a bit more to keep things from getting too easy.\n\nOf course this is all balanced by the bad guys getting a bunch of new equipment....right? Oh, oh no. This is where the lack of fresh content sticks out. There really aren't any new types of bad guys, nor are any new methods developed to help them spot Batman when he's stalking them. Everyone is still wielding bats or pipes, late-game guys get stun batons, and it's certain they'll get the bright idea to carry riot shields or car doors around. The combat is still good, but it's just more of the same.\n\nThis feeling of sameness extends to other moments in Arkham Origins. An encounter with Deadshot is oddly reminiscent of the final battle between Catwoman and Two-face, the boss-fight with Firefly is eerily similar to the one with Poison Ivy back in Arkham Asylum. As these battles play out I get that familiarity that really shouldn't be there. It's difficult to feel that sense of accomplishment when there's a little voice in the back of my brain saying "What are you celebrating about? You've done this before." The names and locations change, but too many other elements don't.\n\nAs far as concerns the rest of Arkham Origins content. There is the usual collection of vigilante and predator challenge maps, additional playable characters, and...multiplayer? I'll be brutally honest here, I played one multiplayer match, and that was it. What can I say? I'm not much of a competitive MP person. The multiplayer seems to be retaining its popularity well, as I got into a full match within seconds of starting up. Honestly I'd be satisfied with something a bit more simple and direct, Batman & Robin teaming up to put the hurt on some thugs. Maybe there could be some more advanced vigilante and predator maps to keep things balanced.\n\nAll in all, despite Arkham Origins not really doing anything new or improving on its predecessors, I still recommend it. Why? Simply because it's more Arkham. Yes, really, that's absolutely it. Am I shallow or what? Rocksteady struck gold when they developed Arkham Asylum. Now they have a model that can be applied to any and all future Batman games and I'm likely to eat it up everytime. As long as the quality remains at moderately-high level I'll remain a fan. Although I hope that with Rocksteady developing the next game, they include a slew of fresh game-design changes and additions. If the fifth Arkham game turns out to be a retread, I hope it's at least a retread of Arkham Knight and not Arkham City.","August 31, 2014","true","17.0"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/recommended/209000/","ashdot","Callietrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/","1456 products in account","Batman Arkham Origins stars a more younger Batman... a more reckless and more naive Batman that's just now being hunted down - literally - by a group of Assassin's hired by the Black Mask after a prison is raided and the old Police Commisioner dies - Batman is now being hunted by both cops, thugs and the assassins.\n\nThe newest Sequel, which is a Prequel to Arkham Asylum - was developed by a new studio - not Rocksteady, and there were some... changes and some not-so changes that ultimately make this, in my opinion, the worst Batman Arkham game out there right now. It is still a solid game however and it is pretty well built.\n\nNow this game, visually, is a little different from the more Comic/Cartoony looking Arkham games Rocksteady had made. Origins looks a bit more... like plastic I should say but it's not entirely bad, same goes for the major enemies like Deathstroke, Killer Croc and the like. The environments also look pretty cool as you see snow tracks being made by either you or enemies (can be further enhanced by Direct X11 tasselation and PhysX features, respectively) but I found myself feeling a sort of Deja Vu, and it wasn't too far fetched to say they directly lifted models and scapes and pretty much rebuilt Arkham City and modeled it to be a standalone Gotham, which was pretty lazy - however, the nifty visual effects DX11 can bring, make this game quite a looker, Batman himself looks pretty beefy (though I noticed there is a might tight bit wrong with his model - his right arm seems to be longer than his left arm), the major enemies look pretty well designed with the minor nitpick that the enemy models repeat far too much and offer little to no variety.\n\nBatman here has pretty much the exact same gadgets he has in Arkham Asylum and City - disappointingly enough. Other than the Shock Gloves - there's nothing you obtain that really makes much of an advancement over City. You still have your standard Batarangs, the Sonic Batarangs, Smoke Pellets, the Explosive Gel, the Grapple Hook and it's enhancer, the Decrypter and of course - the new Shock Gloves, which you obtain later on in the game. The Shock Gloves are like a temporary upgrade in combat that enhances your damage and makes your attacks unblockable while they are active. To Power up the Shock Glove, you still counter and fight as your normally would in a fight, once powered, you can activate 'em and start wreaking havoc. The Shock Gloves made the game considerably easier and it's the main way you're going to be able to add a 2x hit to your combo counter, unlike how it originally worked in Asylum - which was with an upgrade to your combos.\n\nThere are also a multitude of upgrades. Sadly, this was made worse thanks to a streamlining system they made for it. On previous Batman Arkham games, you could purchase upgrades as you would unlock them via sthe story - be them Health, Defense, Finishers, combos enhancers/extenders, etc - you can still buy ALL of them in Origins, but you need to buy previous and sometimes completely unrelated upgrades in order to get the ones you want. This to me was not a very welcome addition as it just made me want to pump all my upgrades into one skill tree instead of balancing out Batman but frankly, other than Defense enhancers (one for ballistics/bullets and one for armour/fist fights) there wasn't much I really wanted to get as upgrades in this particular game are pretty minimal.\n\nThis game pretty much plays out like past Arkham games - it has the exact same "Free Flow" combo combat, except it has a few minor twists. You press a button to attack in continuation and when an enemy is downed, you can hold a direction towards an enemy and press the attack button/key again and Batman will lunge himself towards them in a very sleek and stylish manner. You can also hit another key/button that makes Batman swing his cape at the enemy and temporarily blinds/stuns them - when an enemy is stunned, if you mash the attack button on that enemy - Batman will unleash a fast and furious flurry of punches against that particular enemy and it feels really, really satisfying to do - by far the thing I did most in the game and you'll be doing it a lot aswell, considering some enemies NEED to be stunned before you can damage them - this is truer in boss battles - and of course, you can tap the batarang key/button to make Batman spam throw Batarangs at enemies - this serves as your basic projectile attack - and like in previous Arkham games, you can still counter incoming enemy attacks using the "Counter" key/button and evade/pole vault over enemies using the "Evade" key/button.\n~Later on in the game, however, you will unlock more moves and finishers you can utilize to extend your combos, combo counter or simply permanently defeat a downed enemy faster.\n\nLike the past Arkham games (will be saying this a LOT), predator mode is back, and it still functions like you would expect. You can hide under grates, use the crouch key/button to make Batman move lower and more quieter (for some reason this animation is actually faster than your standard walking animation) as well as grapple up top of a Statue. You'll be working to take down enemies while in Predator mode - you can do this a multitude of ways. You can use Explosive Gel placement spots and remotely activate them to KO an enemy, but makes a lot of noise, you can simply walk up behind them and put 'em to sleep, you can use an "inverted takedown" which has Batman drop down from the statue, tie up the enemy by the feet and hang them upside down, and of course, you can issue takedowns (noisy ones) from grates and vents - there's still a lot of versatility with stealth and such, but nothing in it is new at all - it is still very satisfying however, to pull of a predatory encounter very fast and pitch perfect before anyone even finds out what happened.\n\nNow onto the game itself... it's repetitive. Out of all the Arkham games, this one, even though it plays the exact same as City is so much more repetitive and dull and that's because it lacks variety. For some reason, Gotham is infested by corrupted cops and thugs and every single one of them wants to kill you. Not only do most of these thugs use the same model repeated, over and over again - but so do the cops. Sure there are "Crimes" to stop, but they also culminate in "Drop here, beat them all up" - it's mind numbing how boring it is. There's honestly not much to do outside of story missions. The "Nigma" datapaks , which are the equivalent of Riddler Trophies from past games are easier to find and the puzzles are a lot more dumbed down than in past games aswell. You also have little satellites you can to throw your batarand at to clear up an area's signal so you can unlock a travel point, but that is also very boring and tedious to do.\n\nBoss battles fare no different either. While some boss battles here - namely the Deathstroke battle - is more "creative" than past games' mini-game like boss battles, they ultimately feel too scripted and repetitive. You do NOT get to fight all of the assassin's within the story arc (two of them are left out to Side missions - seriously - why?) and you get to fight one a total of 3 times! Wow - not very creative are we?\n\nAll in all, it's still a Batman Arkham game, albeit a more dumbed down, tedious version that brings absolutely nothing new to the table other games haven't brought before. It is fun though, and the mechanics work pitch perfect - though for some reason the awesome crackle noise the game made whenever you finished a battle and punched the last thugs' face in is gone. I still recommend playing through it (at a reduced Price mind you - not at $40+) because it's a beautiful game, especially if you can utilize the Direct X11 features coupled with PhysX - they are astoundingly beautiful to behold. Batman's voice actor also changed, but it works to his advantage in a certain way.\n\n","January 21, 2014","true","24.1"," 32 of 47 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","32","47","0","6"

It was made by a different developer than the previous two games, since Rocksteady was busy working on Arkham Knight.\n\nThe things Origins does well is mostly in the storytelling department. I really liked how the game takes place early on in Batman's career as a crime fighter. Characters remark with surprise treating the protagonist as a myth and Batman himself comes across as more inexperienced and arrogant. It feels more in-line with the Nolan movies in this regard and it's a welcome change from the previous two games which felt like extensions of the Batman Animated series.\n\nHowever, Arkham Origins isn't as polished as Asylum, nor does it have the steller presentation of City. It's clear the developers were working with a limited budget and time constraints, and that they weren't interested in innovating on the previous games like Rocksteady was. I still do like Origins but I think of it more of a spinoff to the previous two games rather than a sequel.

It does however entertain for what it's worth. The game is set 5 years before Arkham Asylum, where you play a less refined and experienced Batman. Black Mask places a bounty on your head which 8 of the world's greatest assassins heed the call to. The Gotham City Police Department aren't fond of Batman, and the tactical team, lead by Branden, attempt to take Batman down themselves to earn the bounty. At this point James Gordon isn't the commissioner yet, as he is the Captain, and he and Detective Harvey Bullock are trying to take down the Batman.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this game. I was never too fond of Arkham Asylum, giving it an average rating, however I loved Arkham City, and it remains to be one of the very fews games I've ever given a 10/10 for. Regardless of whatever issues that game had, I enjoyed it far too much to deny it of that rating. Sadly to say Arkham Origins didn't entertain me as much as Arkham City did, but it did (in my opinion) stay true to the franchise. I would've loved to see Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy reprise their roles as Joker and Batman, however I enjoyed the new voice actors as they really did sound like the characters they were portraying. That being Troy Baker as Joker, and Roger Craig Smith as Batman.\n\nOne disappointing factor about this game is that you don't see much of the assassins, when that was one of the high points of this game, you only fight each assassin once, and in the Electrocutioner's case, it is a very short battle, where he literally falls and faints if you punch him ONCE, then Batman insults him and leaves the battleground. Deadshot, and Lady Shiva aren't even in the main story and are only in side missions (one series each). The only assassins whose true potentials was met were Bane, and Firefly. Both of their objectives as far as Batman goes, made sense, their character's dialogue seemed to be on par with their characters in the comics, and previous games, and their "Screen time" was more than suffice.\n\nThe DLCs released for the game haven't been too impressive, I always like the extra skins for my character as they are always really good adaptations of the DCU comics, however aside from that the Initiation DLC was a huge let down in my opinion, as it was just a challenge campaign and not a real story. The new DLC just announced (I'm speculating to be a Mr. Freeze DLC, based on the picture alone which is an award for the "Wayne Foundation Humanitarian of the Year" where a sculpture of a woman holding a huge heart shaped diamond over her head, with shards of ice all around her) seems to be promising as it will carry on where the game left off, and I hope will provide that same story telling that was so greatly successful in Arkham City.\n\nOverall I love the Batman series, from comics, to movies, to games, so my review may be a little biased and skewed to give this game a victory it may not completely deserve, I still recommend it to anyone who likes Batman, wants to get into the series, or just wants an exciting open world superhero game to play in.\n\nWB Montreal played it on the safe side and didn't change too many things. They added many new features, but all of which are on a small scale, so if you liked Arkham City, or even Asylum, as far as their game play went, there should be no reason for you to not like the game play of Arkham Origins.\n\nRating the three games in order I would say Arkham City wins, followed by Arkham Origins, and Arkham Asylum. I would recommend this game to be played from beginning to end, from the main story, to the side stories, and even those annoying Enigma challenges.\n\nTaking everything into consideration I would rate Arkham Origins at 7.5/10.","January 17, 2014","true","23.9"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jacksawild/recommended/209000/","jacksawild","jacksawild","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jacksawild/","114 products in account","This game annoys me for many reasons. Mainly it is down to consistency.\n\nThey managed to screw up the brilliant combat system. While it is still fun, it is inferior to the previous two games. Sometimes you can free flow to an opponent, sometimes you'll punch the air and sometimes you'll favour hitting a guy already on the floor instead of the one who is standing next to him. The upshot is that you will lose your combo and this is annoying. You also have to be careful with quickfire gadgets, you can fire a batclaw at the only standing enemy and before you're finished slamming him another guy can stand up slide to you and break your combo with no chance of countering him. Same goes for any move which takes longer than a single beat (cape stun, mine laying etc). I like the idea that you have to be careful when to use these multi beat moves but the lack of consistency and apparent psychic/superhuman powers of your enemies means that it is less about skill and more luck.\n\nThe linear nature of this game is very obvious. There will be doors which look like other doors you can use but which are nothing other than scenery, no interaction, no trying to budge a blocked door or funny little animations of henchmen surprised that Batman is knocking on their door. The line launcher only works on rare and obvious anchor points. The grappler will sometimes let you grapple, but sometimes you will just hit the side of the building you're trying to glide to.\nThere seems to be one way to approach situations and any other idea you may have will be blocked by scenery (Batman is defeated by a single strand of police tape.. don't tell Joker), bad grapple mechanics or doors which mysteriously lock themselves after you've walked through them. I think it's a cheek to call this an open world game. The ability to hang from a ledge you are perched on has been removed, one can only assume because the developers were drunk or suffered head injuries.\n\nThe Deathstroke fight was little more than a button mashing interactive movie, ensuring you get to see all the animations the devs have made for you. Speaking of animations, a great improvement on AA by AC was the death animations. You know, where the bad guy would taunt Batman as he lay dying. They're great, but you don't want to be forced to watch them 20 times while you learn how to beat whatever stage you're on. Arkham City allowed you to skip these and get back to the game, Arkham Origins has gone back to the philosophy of Arkham Asylum (i.e. watch this animation, then wait for a reload).\n\nThe new detective mode is nice except it also suffers the linearity problems. You'll need to scan various aspects of the scene to build up a picture of what happened but you can't progress to the next peice of evidence until Batman has finished musing to himself about the previous one and forcing you, again, to watch animations.\n\nI was going to finish this one before starting Arkham Knight but I think I'll skip it for now, though I will probably return to it when I want some more Batman. All in all, I wont recommend the game because the problems are too numerous. It isn't terrible overall, but it does leave a sour taste. If the other games didn't exist, I probably wouldn't mind so much. Get it on sale or something.","January 2","false","7.6"," 41 of 64 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","41","64","0","0"

And also because it's due time for an updated one.\n\nStory\nThis story takes place after 2-3 years of Batman donning his cape and cowl. 8 assassins are tasked with finding and killing you for 50 million placed by Black Mask. Killer Croc, Firefly, Shiva, Bane, Deadshot, Copperhead, Electrocutioner and Deathstroke are all out to kill you. Or so it seems. The twists are done well....however most people are not happy to see Joker take the spotlight once again. You need to remember that the title is called 'Origins' for a reason. It's exploring how Batman first meets some of his greatest enemies/foes. Naturally, you'll think of a couple being left out. Where's Two Face and Poison Ivy? What about Scarecrow? They didn't come into being until later. Overall, I think the story was well enough thought out and I don't get sick of it.\n\nGameplay\nI won't sugar coat it. The gameplay is the clunkiest of the Arkham series. Batman will sometimes lose the freeflow due to hitting air regardless of being near enemies, hits are slower and counters don't always register. There are a couple new gadgets Batman obtains and uses and they add more fun to predator areas. The addition of shock gloves makes Batman much more powerful. Too powerful in fact. Once activated, you ignore any special goons and just hit right through anything. It does double damage as well. It's fun, but makes things too easy at times. I really like the martial artists. They definitely provide more of a challenge forcing you to counter as much as you hit. The new detective system is fun to use as well to solve crimes. I've heard some encounter game breaking bugs still, however I haven't had these problems. But WB Montreal did rush this so it doesn't surprise me all too much.\n\nGraphics\nBetter than AC, but not by much. They added some fog effects and smart snow to add to the depth and I found it pretty cool and impressive. But that's about it. Graphics are nothing special.\n\nMultiplayer\nThis was an absolute wreck at first. Many bugs and it worked literally 1/4th of the time due to never-ending loading screens. You have 3 teams. The Bane gang, Joker gang and Heroes. The two gangs war it out trying to take and protect key points on the map while Batman and Robin try to stop it all by taking either gangs members down and filling a fear meter. The match ends if one gang loses all lives, all points are held for a certain time or Batman and Robin fill their fear meter. Joker and Bane are playable of course. Bane is overpowered though. Able to absorb what seems like 10 full magazines and is equipped with a rocket launcher on top of it. Joker uses his handy pistol and will kill you in one shot if hit. It isn't perfect, but it's definitely enjoyable.\n\nOverall\nOrigins is worth the purchase. Both singleplayer and multiplayer are done well. And this will retain some value because of the multiplayer portion. While it can be clunky at times, you can easily overlook it and enjoy every moment. My only complaints are the clunkiness and how empty the map can feel compared to City. Definitely recommended.","June 2, 2015","true","97.2"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","21","28","0","16"

The story takes place in a pre-Arkham Gotham city, staring a young and inexperienced Batman. The police force of Gotham is corrupt and mostly not better than the mobsters and criminals that run Gotham. The game takes place on Christmas eve, where Black Mask has hired 8 of the worlds greatest assassins to kill Batman.\nThe gameplay is smooth most of the time as it was in the previous Arkham games. Moving around is easier than ever with the new fast travel. The city is about the same size as Arkham City but is divided between old and new Gotham.\nThe combat system from the previous games returns. It is all based around timing and the rhythm of the fight. The stealth is a lot like Arkham City. You have the same structure of the last two games. New type of enemies and gadgets are introduced to add new elements to the game. There is a new addition to the detective mode. There are parts of the game where you use it to analyze a crime scene and piece together the crime. It is no longer just find something to trace and follow it to from point A to B.\nThe boss fights are improved and feel more serious but are repetitive. The story felt weaker compared to the other games. The main story could also last longer. There are also again side missions, again you have to collect the Riddler trophies. The challenge mode also returns in Arkham Origins.\nArkham Origins comes with a multiplayer mode. In my opinion it was not really necessary to implement a multiplayer.\nBatman: Arkham Origins does enhance the visuals of the Arkham City engine and it is a very great looking game on max settings. The visuals are not a massive step above the already great looking previous game.\nThere is not much music to listen to but the overall theme sounds nice and fits with the whole story. All the characters do sound great. You have plenty of younger versions of characters seen in previous games. The new voice of the Joker sounds really a lot like the Mark Hamil voice.\nOverall, this game is fun. I enjoyed it almost as much as the other two games.\n\nSounds 10/10\nGraphics 10/10\nGameplay 8/10\nAtmosphere 8/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","February 22, 2015","true","48.4"," 28 of 42 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","28","42","6","1"

And that I did on Halloween night. Ten hours later, my opinions on the game have changed drastically. This is the largest, most complete, most refined Arkham to date. Every single aspect of the game has been tuned to the point where it has reached its full potential.\n\nIt is true that regarding game play, this is Arkham City on a larger scale, with a larger map and plenty more skills, animations, gadgets and so on. But the story in Origins is fantastic and stands out as the best in the trilogy. Every major enemy is introduced with flair, and the fights are spectacular. The Deathstroke battle (which has caused many a lot of trouble, but I thoroughly enjoyed) in particular, was epically designed. The martial artistry displayed in this scene is jaw dropping. I cannot think of a more awesome and cinematic showdown in a comic book-inspired video game.\n\nI must say I do find a major setback with regards to a particular decision in the art direction, and that is Batman´s character design. It makes no sense at all. An excessively armored Batman on his second professional year cannot be justified on any grounds, and the countless amount of gadgets, from the get go, at times removed me from the context the story so passionately tries to portray.\n\nThe atmosphere is thick with immersion and somehow darker as well. I feel this visual interpretation more akin to the Batman world I know and grew up with. Similar to what Tim Burton did on his second Bats movie.\n\nSo to wrap things up, yes, Origins is very similar to Arkham City. Yet after spending some time with it, I´ve come to the conclusion that the Arkham formula is too much of a winning one, and polishing it rather than messing with it was perhaps, the safest and truest (to the franchise) course of action WB could have taken. Batman Arkham Origins´ biggest hurdle is its legacy, and the uncontrollable human tendency to compare.\n\nAs a gamer and Batman fan, I have given the game a chance and wholeheartedly recommend Arkham Origins. A truly memorable experience if measured on its own grounds.\n\nOverall: I can only wish this was the first installment. Arkham City was pretty much a perfect game but it doesn't preclude Origins from being a great game.\n\nNote: Don't skip the credits scene.","November 14, 2013","true","16.3"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","1"

I loved Origins from start to finish. The story has more focus, and is centered around a few central characters. It's a nice 'Year Two' type story, with Batman learning that oppossing Gordon maybe isn't the smartest idea. The finale was a blast to play and there were some purely fan service moments that were still handled really well.\n\nI still miss the more metroidvania approach from Asylum, but Origins deals with the open world type gameplay better than City itself.\n\nAlso, it has the Deathstroke battle, which is definitely one of the finest moments in the series.","April 23, 2014","true","22.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

It's simple: It's about Alfred trying to have a peaceful christmas meal.\nKhm! A villain put a bounty on Batman. You're basically going around Gotham fighting bounty hunters and trying to capture the person who placed the bounty on you. There is a little twist in the story but that's pretty much it.\nIt took me 14h to finish the story. I did stick around to solve some cases and take down last of the remaining Enigma servers but I did not go for 100% completion. I assume it would take around 20h to do everything.\n\nGameplay is pretty much the same as in the previous two Arkham titles altho i have to say that the combat does feel a lot more faster and smoother in here. You can upgrade and unlock new gadgets as you progress in the game. Those same gadgets let you access different parts of the map or help you get to a shiny precious collectible.\nIf you've played any of the Batman games you know what to expect from the combat/gameplay.\n\nGraphically the game is superiour to the previous Arkham games and it is still good to look at even in 2016. The voice acting is supreme. The gameplay is fun and the story is decent enough to keep you hooked until the ending.\nI'd say the game is worth the full price.\n\n- I did experience one crash and about 2-3 graphical glitches during my playthrough.\nI understand it had a rocky launch but the game seems to be fixed by now and you have to work really hard to come across a bug.","April 17","true","16.6"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","12","14","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TKoMEaP/recommended/209000/","TKoMEaP","Favorite Son","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TKoMEaP/","134 products in account","Overall Opinion: If you enjoyed Arkham City and wanted more of that, or love Batman lore, you'll enjoy Arkham Origins. If not, Arkham Origins offers little value to you.\n\nNumber Rating: 8/10\n\nWARNING: I highly recommend getting a controller for your PC before buying Arkham Origins, the M&K controls just aren't as fluid\n\nBatman: Arkham Origins is definitely the most hated of the Arkham series (not that that's saying much, considering the other 2 are considered amazing), so frankly when I picked this up and saw it had already dropped to $20 in the course of a few months...I was prepared for an awful game that tainted the Arkham series.\n\nI'm happy to say, I was wrong. Fans of the series will notice a distinct lack of innovation in Arkham Origins, but at the same time, it's not like WB Games Montreal "ruined" any of the mechanics. Plus the game does take quite a few steps forward, all though to varying degrees of success.\n\nThe best way I can describe it is, while Arkham City and Asylum were both revolutionary in many areas, Arkham Origins just evolves their formula slightly.\n\nPC Port: Running the game on a GTX 660, everything maxed out (including PhysX) and FXAA High enabled, I was getting a stable 60fps and above for most of the game. A few areas and fights (especially one fight with Bane on a rooftop) I noticed some drops but nothing too bad.  The FoV is just fine, really nothing to complain about. Runs solid and looks solid. My only issues would have to be the stuttering when you first boot up the game as Unreal 3 loads in the rest of the world, and the sudden changes to pre-rendered footage at times.\n\nVisuals: The game maintains that dark Arkham feeling, as the snow comes down on Gotham on Christmas Eve. It looks great, in a gloomy kinda way. The Nvidia effects in the game are really nice looking, smoke moves out of your way as you pass by, paper and money flies around in fights, and Batman himself looks really well detailed. It's quite impressive for an Unreal 3 game, but it's still obvious this is Unreal 3 and that engine is aging. Textures will pop in at close distances and that can look pretty bad at times. Also, there are some odd animations when characters talk in game, especially Alfred. Hard to explain, but it just looks...wrong.   However, I have to say I believe this is probably the best looking Unreal 3 game to date. And with Arkham Knight being made in Unreal 4, I think this IS the best looking Unreal 3 game we'll get.\n\nStory: Wow...the story in this game is actually really good! After the rather strange ending to Arkham Asylum, and cluttered mess of a story that happened in Arkham City (not saying I didn't like them, but their stories weren't exactly the selling point of the game) I didn't expect much from this game. Especially when I heard Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy would not be making an appearance as the Joker and Batman in this game, unlike in Arkham City and Asylum. However, to my surprise both actors that replaced them do a great job, especially Troy Baker's Joker. The story manages to be just as chaotic as Arkham City, while having a central goal: Track down the assassins. And it's delivered very well. The game is more of a origin story for Joker and Batman's relationship though, instead of Batman himself. And it's quite neat to see the first time Batman and Joker have that "connection", where they realize they were in some odd way, meant to meet. I have to say, I was very impressed with this story, and there were some truly emotional moments in it. All though it is pretty predictable at times, there are still a good chunk of twists that keep the story moving at a good pace. Also, I really enjoy how tough and angry this Batman is compared to the more experienced and calm Arkham City and Asylum Batman. Arkham Origin's Batman is the type of guy that leaves some criminal hanging on top of a building, then comes back to the guy in a police station, just to beat him up again.\n\nGameplay: Batman: Arkham City 2.0 basically. There are some neat additions, such as the ability to use your zipline to attach enemies to each other, or throw fire extinguishers at them. However, other than that gameplay is identical. They did add in a more advanced crime scene investigation detective mode, but it's only used maybe 3-4 times total, and most of the time you're just looking for the red arrow instead of actually figuring out what happened yourself. This mechanic is pretty awesome in the Deadshot side mission, but since at E3 2013 they showed it off already, it kinda spoiled the whole expereince of that side mission.\n\nSetting: Part of Gotham City, the bat cave, and Black Gate prison are the locations the game takes place in, all on Christmas eve. The world feels VERY similar to Arkham City. The northern part of the map (or Old Gotham) is basically straight out of Arkham City, Wonder Tower is even in the center of it. That doesn't change the fact the setting works really well for the game, it's just a bit of a shame to not see them try to expand Gotham besides adding in an absurdly long bridge and a little bit of land in the south. Plus, citizens are just no where to be seen. There is a curfew going on which could explain it I guess, but it just makes the world feel lifeless.\n\nMusic: Just making this a category from now on in my reviews. So the music is great, it keeps with the whole dark and heavy tone the Christopher Nolan Batman movies soundtracks have. Also, whoever decided to have that remix of "Carol of the Bells" as the Joker's main theme...kudos to you.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4kPI9aF1oU\n\nPros:\nSoundtrack\nStrong character line up\nStory\nVisuals\nActing\nFluid gameplay\nLoads of content\nCons:\nSeems less polished than City and Asylum\nBugs that required me to restart checkpoint to proceed\nCopy and Paste feeling\nRepetitive boss fights\nIndifferent:\nMultiplayer. Did not try it, but might be worth a shot.\nSide missions. Some of them are really good, others are VERY lazy and lacking compared to Arkham City.\nSetting. It works, but it feels like an opportunity was missed when it comes to making Gotham feel like a breathing city worth fighting for.\nIt's a good time, don't get me wrong. I'd definitely recommend picking it up in the upcoming Fall sale. Also, anybody see the new Arkham Knight footage? HOLY CRAP! 2015 just can't get here fast enough.","November 25, 2014","true","25.5"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

The developers of Batman: AO apparently had one goal: If it isn't broken, fiddle with it until it is.  They took Batman: AC, and managed to break every single aspect of the game in some way or another.  The bugs are innumerable and the developers publicly stated that they would not be fixing any so they would have more time to work on the DLC.  Seriously?\n\nWhere to start...Batman occasionally glitches out while gliding in the air like he's bouncing off a platform and actually gains elevation while doing so.  I've gotten stuck on ledges, in objects, and been teleported to my destination when stuck while grappling.  Enemies will sometimes teleport to their fallen companions after being alerted in stealth rooms.  The graphics somehow received a significant downgrade despite including additional eye candy that AC doesn't have along with facial animations from 15 years ago.  It also includes new performance problems that cause the game to stutter badly when flying around the city and in certain rooms indoors.  Side quests regularly break with fights getting stalled or being unable to continue mission steps in the city.  Combat timing feels off with counters being harder to pull off than they should be, and a couple times I had enemies attack me from so far away that even though I had a counter indicator, Batman would ready a gadget rather than countering.  This is made worse by the game wildly varying the timescale during combat.  I've read about some major progression-blocking bugs as well but luckily I never ran into any.\n\nThen come the design problems.  The map has no mouse support and the keyboard moves the cursor in very large increments making it very difficult to select specific locations (I know this won't affect many players but it's inexcusable for the map to be that hard to use with kb/m.)  The game has a lengthy tutorial laboriously explaining the basics but afterwards assumes you have already played the previous games and does not explain anything until after you've failed the first time.  The game includes way too many cutscenes and at several points in the game will drop you back into the game only to have you press one button before starting another cutscene.  Most of the bossfights are long and tedious and a few rather frustrating - none feel well-designed.  During one fight, after one of the frequent in-game cutscenes the boss recovered and hit me before the game gave me control back.  Riddler has been copy-pasted into the game as Enigma except with less personality and extremely simplistic puzzles.  The game includes less interesting characters overall and half the story feels like a rehash of AC.  The new challenge system is strictly linear and will only let you attempt one at a time and most can only be completed in story missions which makes it extremely difficult to complete in one playthrough.  Many ledges are ungrappleable for no reason other than to artificially make it more difficult to reach that location.  Oh, and it seems Batman hasn't learned how to punch through plywood yet despite having more gear than AC and acting like The Hulk the whole game.\n\nThe only good thing I found in the game is that you unlock certain gadgets and abilities through side missions, rather than all through the story.  The new martial arts master enemies are pretty interesting as well, though they can make fights a bit unpredictable due to the variable way they react to attacks and counters.\n\nSo in summary, they took AC, made every part of the game worse, added a big pile of bugs, and released AO.  Play AA and AC instead or wait for AK.  Save your sanity, I already lost mine.","April 20, 2015","false","21.8"," 43 of 72 people (60%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","60","43","72","7","0"

Nobody wanted this game when it was announced that original developers Rocksteady were not behind the helm, myself included, but after seeing it on sale I just had to suck up the misgivings and give it a whirl. As it turns out I was extremely pleasantly surprised. This game gives you more access to Batman's iconic arsenal and carte blanche to use it not only on the City's criminals, but also the police force. Yes, that's right, as the Dark Knight of Arkham you get to use your near super human abilities to shatter the bones and bodies of every police man you see. Furthermore, you are even given a mission to infiltrate the Arkham City Police Station, and after a few grumbles from Alfred about toning back the devastating blows when fighting the police, you are then allowed to brutally incapacitate every on duty officer inside the station. The sheer amount of officers you are allowed to perform the ingame "takedowns" and "freeflow combat combos" on absolutely blows away the miserly amount of cops you could attack in the previous games (note to Rocksteady, the mind controlled security guards in City and Asylum did not satisfy. The fans want to punch REAL cops who are fighting back on their own terms). Overall I'd say this game is one of the best Cop Smashing Games on the market and is a must have for any fans of beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of cops.","May 25, 2014","true","51.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

These guys don’t have much of a lead but they are up to no good so first I need to drop down and do a little training on a few faces.\n\nOrigins is the third game from the new Batman series but takes place before the last two. You are basically in the early years of being the bat. You’ll get to see some of the first encounters with some classic villains from the Batman stories we all love. Black Mask has put a $50 million bounty on Batman’s head and you now get the fun and excitement of dealing with all the villains who want that money. Not all is what it seems as you are soon to find out after a little progression and discovery.\n\nThe games graphics look about the same as AA & AC. Which is a good thing because I love the looks of the characters and environment. I did notice the lip syncing to be off sometimes but no problems there. Voices were all great like usual and I love the music specially the darker tone Christmas stuff.\n\nGameplay is what you expect from the last two games. Use your predator skills for silent takedowns which is always fun. Gadgets galore to use at your disposal. Like the new glue grenades to immobilize an attacker for a short time, or a gun which shoots a wire across to anchor points to be used as a zip line or tight rope. You can also use it to hook criminals to objects or each other.  Many fun times with that one. Other gadgets are your typical batarangs, grappling hook, explosive gel, and some others from the previous games.\n\nThere’s plenty to do in Gotham this time around with some side stories like Anarky, Deadshot and a few others. Small crimes you can solve which is now done with a cool feature were you can see a reenactment of the crime to discover what happen. A pretty cool feature and should be expanded on later down the line. Then there are the Riddler challenges again, which are just small packages you find throughout the city. Not as cool as the Riddler challenges from the previous game but it does give a little change.\n\nNow the combat is what Rocksteady had perfected in the last two games and really made it exciting and fun to get into fist fights with your enemies. It was so fluid and fast and just beautiful to pull off some amazing moves. I’m not sure what happen but WB Montreal seem to screw up the system. Counters don’t seem to work many times and the fighting just did not feel as balanced as usual. It was disappointing and aggravating at times but I still had a blast playing.\n\nBatman: Arkham Origins is a wonderful game to play and a great addition to the Batman franchise even despite its small flaws and some bugs I encountered. Like the red screen bug you get when entering the GCPD. Your screen turns red when you enter the rooftop door and then your PC restarts after like 10 seconds. An easy fix as you just have to put the game into windowed mode before entering and you can then go back full screen after that. Just be careful though because one downfall I got was after I beat the game and was almost finished with all side missions I forgot about this bug and got the red screen. When I restarted everything up again I had lost the last 7 hours of gameplay and all my completion stats. Luckily for me I had finished the game before this happened.\n\nIf the little issues don’t scare you away then pick this up and enjoy the great Batman story and fun.\n\nBear Rating: 7.5/10\n","December 25, 2013","true","30.7"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

(Chronological Order) Released in October 2013. Being the first game, it  serves as the Action-packed Origin Story where (A Fresh from Training.) Bruce learns many new skills and meets many vital characters in the Arkham Storyline! (Note that this is Rocksteady's adaptation so it will be different to any origins or sagas from the comics! This is a Videogame Dammit!)\nAlso i wont Spoil anything from the story here because im reviewing overall content and mechanics, not specific parts of the plot. You can find a neat summary on the games page for this. ;)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=630865902\nWithout further ado, lets get to the Black and the White, the Strengths and the Reserved Judgement that is the...\nPros and Cons.\n\nPROS:+Pointy Bat-ears Strike Fear into Dumb thugs! xD\n+The Plot is done in such a way that its almost episodic and gives each character a balanced time in the spotight! (Before being beaten up by Batman.) Lots of new enemies are introduced especially, their origins are also given an arkham game spin. This is the origins game of the series and revelas lots and lots about the people of gotham! No spoilers here but there are many plot twists and interesting turns for the story, though they  could take a while to be revealed.\n+Graphics are good for the time, couldnt ask for more here. Its what you would expect from 2013, nothing more, nothing less. Lots of little effects like snowfall and chilled breaths give gotham a true Christmas feel.\n+His Cowl+Snowflakes=<3\n+Bigger Map Size which is surprisingly dense with activities. It expands on Arkham Cities map and adds south gotham to The North, connected by the gotham pioneer bridge. Gliding across the snow capped rooftops of The Major Areas of Gotham is a really unique feeling. Especially for a Batman game.\n+Collectibles will keep any gamer busy for at least a few days! (Maybe too many...)\n+The Boss battles are Balanced and shouldnt take too long to complete. Although many of them use repeating sequences, they will be beaten quickly so its not too much of a problem!\n+The Origins of the Characters are generally really well done! If you cant see this game as a big new entry to the series, you can at least view it as a backstory to other games in the series. (As it is the First.) Bruce's story about developing into a more solid and refined figure of justice is given to us in an immpressive way. The Pacing of the plot is done well, but you are reminded often that this is far from a cinematic experience. I wouldnt imagine seein this as a film at all (Which is probably for the better.)\n+Many new Features to gameplay include: Enhanced Detective Mode with the ability to "rewind" scenarios, new gadgets and interface additions. (Keep in mind that he gets all of these NEW features before Arkham Asylum!!)\n+It has Added Multiplayer for the first time! I've tried it only a few times so i cant say much but it does have some good modes and progression. But im betting people will buy this for the story, combat and thrill of being Brucey boy!\n+Story is about 12-16 hours without touching on any of the other fun Activities! This is definetely long enough for gamers and it is the average length for the Arkham games too, so thats good!\n+Once again, the combat system is done so well, its just so smooth! It seems like Batman is just dancing at some points, he feels in the zone at some times! Although, saying that, the targetting can get a bit off a completely ruin a huge combo..The Combat system is simple enough to understand quickly but complex enough to put major effort into strining together some Badass combos! The Mechanics of Hand to Hand (To Gadget too!) Combat in the Arkham Games are a true marvel of third person Action games, and many games (Of the same genre) have tried to dupicate aspects that stood out. Watch some gameplay of challenge maps if you still arent convinced. (I do wish there was a mode where a comic balloon would pop out and say Kapow! or Wack! with every few punches and kicks. ;D)\n\nCons:-Its Riddled (See what i did there) with bugs and even some crashes at times. Although the main offender is frame drops in graphically busy sequences. These are minor issues but people have been known to have much worse. Obviously on Launch there was some Large problems that arose, but they were quickly patched by Rocksteady. (Every game will have issues on launch! just depends how much coverage they get really!)\n-A Gloomy Gotham leads to Brightness issues and an annoying fog thats makes it hard to see long distances.\n-Mission objectives often include much Backtracking, Many Dull Dialogue scenes and timed sequences that seem far to easy to the average gamer.\n-Linear Environment around the City. Like Doors that you cant open at all, Blank and boring walls, Slow Animations and No Miscellaneous Interactive objects to find!\n-Repetitive boss battles! The Deathstroke one is the worst offender!its really only3 different Counters and then a simple beatdown for one of the best mercenaries in DC!? A Skillful Meta-human gets given this disgraceful Repeat of actions? Quite sad really. Boss battles actually have variation between each major VIllain, taking a new apporach to defeat them really uses all of Batmans Skill and Gadgets. However i felt that they were generally better in the other Arkham Games.\n-The New detective mode has difficult controls and slows down the story a bit too much at times. You know  exactly where B is but you havent found the right Clues  to find A beforehand... The Hiding of Evidence is a bit too easy as well.\nGive us a bigger Challenge Rocksteady!\n-The Pacing was a bit strange as well! After a huge boss battle, it would be nice to follow up and see how alfred is doing (And join him for a cuppa!) and fix up your suit right? Instead you will get a call from Enigma and will have to deactivate some bombs straight away! Ignore the fact that Batman is a human being and even he has a bedtime! He must have adrenaline built into the suit...\n-The Plot would have been better with some emotional scenes or bonds built with certain figures even!\nA Sequence about Bruces life, A flashback to when he is training on a mountain. This comes back to pacing and where the story is going...It does have Lots of Plot twists!\n-Among others, Bane is a very different Character, same as many villains. Although this can be excused due to origins and all that. Some Personalities or even costumes for Batman's Foes were a bit of a strange choice. But then again, i read the old school comics so i keep comparing their personalities, etc.\n-Some Gadgets you will hardly use outside of missions and thir uses were too specific to stand out as a true Batman Toy. The Electrical Charge or disrupter (Although useful for armed thugs!) will never match the various functions of the Grapple hook or the Remote-Batarang.\n-The Colour theme seems dull compared to the other games i the series, this is obviously due to the season and the industrial design. But interiors should be more plentiful and have more Variety too!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=631199122\n\nFinal ThoughtsOverall I give this Plot-Packed Arkam experience a 7/10!\nLight on the New Features and Colours, but heavy on the Origin stories and Combat (Once again) this is a must-by for Batman lovers, just to see Rocksteady's take on the Caped-Crusader's rough side...and the familiar line up of Villains that we all know and love.

I'm sorry to report that most reviews were pretty accurate. This game does a diservice to the franchise and to the oustanding job Rocksteady did in the previous installments. Somehow, the new developer managed to screw up the most important aspect of an Arkham game: The flow of movement and combat with unresponsive controls, forced camera perspectives and limited grappling points. The main story is boring and so are the side missions.

And you cannot only blame the time limit or tight budgets: Someone really didn't get it at all and I am really shocked one is capable of ♥♥♥♥ing up such a wonderful game so badly.\n\nin short\nThe main criticism and a heavy one is, that besides an absolutely lame patch work of a story (which is forgiveable), you are forced to do anything the way the game designers want you to. Choice is completely gone and to top that up, the game mechanics are horribly messed up. The first game ever, I vote down - not that it is the worst game ever, but starting from Arkham City it is the worst bootleg, I have ever had to play. Don't buy it and play another round of Batman AC instead!\n\nin detail\nstory\nWhen reps of Warner were questioned about the lack of new stuff in the game, they responded by "Oh, but the story - so amazing twists!" Now, we know for sure, this was a standard marketing phrase and nothing else: The story is non-existent and the "twist" doesn't matter at all and it just shows that someone had no clue about story-telling whatsoever.\nAC had a carefully crafted story there the twist was shocking and turned the story upside down and up again. Here, it just loosely connects the Combat and Predator maps. The introduction of some of the side missions is especially bad: Either it is a glitch and just some audio missing or it goes like: "Oh, I have to do X and Y now, in order to achieve Z!" - completely out of the blue, by just passing areas, w/o logical connection to it. The same goes for the (very short) main story.\n\nside quests\nThis was the only downside to Arkham City, because most of them were really forgettable and in this respect AO is stronger (by sacrificing the main story for it). They are not as "cinematique" as the Cold Call Killer or Tea Party in Wonderland, but they are far superior over the rest of the AC's ones and I like the way the Anarky mission combines gliding and combat skills.\n\ngameplay\nThis is the most important, but also the worst part of this game and the reason why it is so unenjoyable. I would forgive everything else, but among other, this is the main reason for voting it down:\nThe combat mechanics are awful; especially concerning enemy AI's strikes: Sometimes (unlike both AA and AC), they withdraw a strike and you end up loosing the combo because of countering thin air.\nAlso, it seems like you can (hardly) evade over red and yellow strike alert flashes: In AC I could strike an enemy even while he flashes yellow or evade a red one (unless armed, which you can strike), this doesn't work here.\nThe special combo moves "trigger" only in a far smaller area around the enemy and hence you have to be far more precise. In addition to that, if you choose the wrong special combo, there is no automatic replacement (unlike AC, where a Disarm & Destroy turned into a Special Combo Takedown, etc., if the opponent was unarmed).\nOn Predator, enemies are more sound aware than before, some of the chambers have an interesting design. Generally, there is a greater quantity of enemies in the Single Player campaign. In the Challenge maps, it is like in AA and AC.\nDeathstroke plays like a combination of Robin and Nightwing and is horribly underpowered in Predator as well as in Combat Challenges - not a nice experience.\nBut maybe a change due to the Shock Glove, the game's combat novelty. Due to its non-permanent nature, it is rather a plus than a minus to the game and one doesn't have to use them, if you wanna play "old school".\nThe new kid on the Predator block is the Remote Batclaw: Well, we didn't really need it, but I guess more useful than  Nightwing's Escrima sticks.\nWhat makes this claw so bad, is the navigational aspect to it: It replaces the Line Launcher and the Tight Rope completely and thus forces the player to use the intended path and no other! I could line-launch anywhere I wanted to - no more! As well, if there was a ladder and a grappling spot in AA or AC, I could use both options. In AO again, the game forces you to  use the predescribed method. You cannot grapple freely at all and sometimes for absolutely no reason and w/o explanation, the level design changes. Particulary, I am thinking about a mini campaign styled side quest, where Predator comes first and Combat therafter and from one second to the other, after the cut scene, the gargoyles are gone!\nWhy, why the hack don't you let it be the players's choice, whether he wants to engage a small combat map in a Predator like style or vice versa? - This made AA and more so AC so enjoyable: That I had so many chocies.\nAnd Firefly! How can you turn away the opportunity to having the ultimate Predator challenge with a boss capable of using high ground and turning sneaking into a nightmare? Instead, it's just a Poison Ivy and Joker AA type of fight combined with cut scenes. AA & AC both weren't brilliant at boss fights, but this is worse. The other assassins aren't much better: Either, a Harley Quinn's Revenge/Catwoman & Twoface type of Predator challenge or a non-existent fight by simply using Quickfire Gadgets (2 assassins). One fight was more or less completely scripted, but ok since it just happened once.\nIn AC, I could play the game "the hard" or the relaxed way, however I wanted it to. Here, they are desperately trying to make the game harder than AC by not permitting certain options or putting more enemies out there.\nAnother aspect of this is the completely messed up XP progress tree, which seems not to understand the subtle mechanics of AC: What's the point in unlocking basic upgrades only after half way/two thirds into the game? Isn't that again my own choice - or not?\nThe new type of enemies aren't bad, though too much of the same. I like the Martial Artists; nice evolution of the Female Assassin of AC. The Enforcer is like an AC lieutenant and more combo breaking than that.  Preferred the Roman Abramovic Twin's gameplay mechanics.\nThe lovely Riddler questions are gone (too complicated and love to detail would be needed) and are replaced by Anarky Tag's, which is another mere Collectible.\n\ngraphics/design\nCheapish compared to AC. More ain't always better and this counts especially for AO: AC was carefully crafted and you could see the love and detail. Especially the colour scheme was amazing and left you marvelling in a bright phantasy world. AO drowned now in an uninspired shade of grey. Like playing AC on lowest settings w/o any special effects to it. The special flair to each district is gone and grappling points aren't clear at all (i.e. some water towers work, some don't).\nOne area around the electricity company with a non-grapple zone was nice though.\nThe tab menu is horribly complicated now and stuffed with cryptical icons lacking any explanation (mouse hovering/clicking not possible) - again, for no reason.\n\nbugs/tech\nmany minor bugs and glitches as in premature triggering of events (Case File A's second task triggered before the first one), some keys don't work properly (i.e. turning off the Cryptographic Sequencer). There are also some critical bugs which freeze the game completely (not sure, whether game or Steam overlay related).\n\nfinal verdict\nBuy only on a at least 75% off sale, if you really wanna play this game. You don't miss anything.","August 2, 2014","false","72.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","2"

Arkham Origins is far bigger than its predecessors, and plays pretty much the same.  I found the story mode a lot better than Arkham City, and a lot longer than Arkham Asylum. The mission path is easier to fulfill and i never really strayed.   Completing the game was easier to do than leaving untouched missions as i did in City.  However one thing that got on my nerves was the combat sequence.  The mechanics are great, but begun to get repetitive and became quite a chore.   Even so the rest of the gameplay was great and collecting all the collectables seems to be a lot better to seek out than Arkham City.   One new feature that wasn't in the previous installments is the crime scene investigations.  This feature is great, and like the whole sequences it plays out.  Unfortunately there wasn't many of them to do, more of these and less combat would of been great.\n\nI have given the challenges a go but find this crazy repetitive when going from one challenge to another.  Nothing really keeps me wanting more in this mode.  Just get more frustrated when you miss the counter and the combo counter resets, gggrrrrrr!\n\nAnyhow i recommend anybody who has played Batman Arkham City or Asylum to give this a go, its got all the goodness from previous installments and graphically is really good.\n\n7.5/10\n\n","September 15, 2014","true","50.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/legendoom/recommended/209000/","legendoom","Legendoom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/legendoom/","202 products in account","Arkham Origins is, unfortunately, sort of the black sheep of the Arkham Games. What with it not being made by Rocksteady while they worked on Arkham Knight, Origins was put out by Splash Damage Studios instead. And it is, to some degree, underrated. While Arkham Asylum was excellent and Arkham City was good, Origins falls further behind and winds up in the realm of "Better than average", but it is still decent. Everything you liked about Arkham Asylum or Arkham City is still here, mostly. The problem is that Origins somewhat coasts off the success of the Asylum and City, and suffers from a lack of any new cards to throw down.\n\nOn the gameplay front, combat has been improved once again, but it's gotten around to where it has inevitably become repetitive. And the entire map does feel somewhat lazily designed, as no less than half of it is copied over from Arkham City, right down to the Steel Mill section. Side missions are also making their return, although not quite as much of a spectacle. What is new is the crime scene missions, which are a welcome addition using Batman's crime reconstruction technology, although the number of them makes them go on a bit too long and a bit too short each to be truly entertaining. Boss fights haven't been copied, but as a result they're worse than City or Asylum and fail to do anything as impressive as the Mr. Freeze fight from City. Hunting down Deadshot and Riddler are also almost exactly the same from the previous games. Really, on the gameplay side, there isn't much to talk up. It's basically an expansion for Arkham City.\n\nThe story is where Arkham Origins finds a good place. Asylum played much more like a comic book and did quite well in its niche, but City tried to take a darker turn without changing Asylum's formula of "Villain X is doing Y. Go to location Z and beat them up", and therefore suffered for anyone who tried to take it seriously. While Origins doesn't do much to shake that up that formula, it actually explores the relationships of both Batman and one of his biggest enemies, which both its predecessors failed to do. The character arcs affect the plot much more than they did in the previous games, and so with that, Origins takes that successful dark step up that City tried to take but misstepped somewhat. The main plot thread does hop back and forth between side stories a bit too much, but it's not that noticable, and its enjoyable while it lasts. The voice actors also do a very good job filling the shoes of their predecessors, and one villain's VA who I won't mention did such a fantastic job that I didn't realize until halfway through the game that the character's actor had changed.\n\nIf you liked the previous Arkham games, you'll find pretty much everything you liked here, and maybe something you haven't seen before as well. That being said, while Origins doesn't do anything that made me want to punch the developers in the face, it didn't make me want to sing their praises either. There's nothing really new it can bring to the table, although it does make better developments in the story department by making characters more three-dimensional and making them more important to the plot. I'd pick it up on a sale if you aren't 100% convinced, but Origins isn't not worth your time, and it does no dishonor to the name of the Arkham franchise.","June 20, 2014","true","30.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

Buggy, short and poorly designed.\n\nThe story is good and the locations are great (albeit Gotham City doesn't have any pedestrians because of a convenient blizzard storm, and most of what's playable of it is what will become Arkham City in the future).\n\nI've experienced tons of bugs, something that never happened to me in the other Arkham games. For example, one time an entire Crime In Progress scene spawned right in front of me and I got locked inside the model of a truck which spawned on me. Another time I got killed by a bug in the first Bane fight, repeatedly. It took me more than three hours to beat that and I had to let Bane punch me because if I tried to avoid his hits I would get crushed by the floor for some reason, getting bugged inside the floor. Another time I used the Bat Wing to fast travel and my model didn't appear so I had to restart the game.\n\nFighting sucks because of the camera angle, it's very very difficult to aim when blocking or when jumping from one thug to another because the camera twists too fast (and there's no control to turn it off since the only one there is just changes what it does with the camera when you jump out of combat).\n\nThe animations are clumsy and laggy, but the game itself runs smoothly, so I wonder what happened there?\n\nSome of the boss fights are uninspired repetitions of other boss fights from the other games and some even copy some of this very game.\n\nI still recommend it because overall it's still a Batman Arkham game but it's way worse than the others. Buy it on sale and keep in mind Splash Damage hasn't fixed anything yet even though it's been months.\n\nA shame really.","April 5, 2014","true","15.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

[SPOILER ALERT]  The other reason that this game is so hated is because the marketing hinted at a plot that wasn't based around the Joker, and included some smaller members of the rogue gallery as the main characters. Now whilst its not true that some less famous villians are included in this game, its just that the Joker is actually the main villian, along with Bane.  Apart from that, the 'lack of innovation' in this game is the another reason that this game is hated. Whilst in comparison to the other two Arkham Games, that is true, this game has one huge area of innovation: The Multiplayer. Unfourtunately, this was not the audience wanted, so it was largely disregarded. But in fact, the multiplayer is quite fun, and at the time of writing has an active multiplayer community. This is really what I would have wanted from an Arkham multiplayer mode. Stealth against real people. Whilst I will admit playing Batman or Robin is alot more fun than the thugs, there is an equaliser. The fact that at one point in the game, one player will be able to play as the Joker or Bane. This actually can be really challenging for Batman or Robin, especially if the player of the Joker or Bane is good at the game. Of course there is one bug that *still* hasn't been fixed is multiplayer data being wiped. Though by launching the game from singleplayer mode this will prevent this bug, no matter what (from my experience). Some may also have to launch singleplayer again one they are finished, but I haven't experienced this. Now my favourite bit from this game is the Story. Now, obviously some will be dissapointed (see the spoiler) by the plot, but I still think that the story was gold. It was really the first Arkham Game to try to show the flaws in Batman's actions, as he seriously hurts people to stop them hurting others. Some of the corrupt police or common thugs are in desperate positions, and don't have much hope elsewhere, yet Batman will still knock them out cold. Still angered by his parent's death, Batman is demanding, somewhat ungrateful and unable to listen an opinion other than his own, I cringed with every conversation Batman and Alfred had, until the *incident*. Not a single thank you, shouting because Alfred opposed his views, Alfred's relationship with Batman is one of the most heart-breaking of all. The ending was uplifting, and somewhat smart. One pointer is how ubsurd it is how much happens in one night. I'd rate it 7/10, based on the fact Arkham Assylum is a 10/10 for me.","April 20, 2014","true","124.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Instead of Rock Steady, we get a new set of developers and we get this mess of a game. The game had a horrible launch, and the developers only had plans to fix glitches that blocked you from progressing through the game, but they left other bugs and glitches in the game and even announced that they do not have any plans to fix them, which is screwing over the consumer. The game is completely boring, with laughably easy boss fights, uninteresting characters, forced villans, and boring gameplay. What the game manage to do well is, improved combat and a good narrative (But the narrative is not as good as its predecessors.) Also there is no Mark Hamill, instead we get Troy Baker as the Joker (To make the Joker sound younger) And as good as a voice actor Troy Baker is, Troy Baker did not deliver a very good Joker (In my opinion.) Riddler puzzles are way too easy to solve compared to Arkham City and Asylum, the Riddler puzzles in Arkham origins usually take less than 2 minutes to solve rather than you considering using a walk-through since they're so hard to solve. The game is overly repetitive, with nothing new from the previous Batman games. Only a couple new gadgets, and they ''Re-named'' a few. Most of the villains are only used for 30-60 minutes in the game. This was a problem that Arkham City had except this game was worse. We get about 10 villains, and they only make very small/short appearances. The side missions are completely boring as well, and don't tell much of a story as Arkham City did. The game is way too short (Only took 8-9 hours to beat, while taking my time) And the game is way too easy. I never got stuck on the game once, and only died about 3-5 times. I even think it's a hard game to recommend on sale, but a lot of people are saying the game is quite fun, so you are probably going to have to try the game out for your self.","July 23, 2014","false","12.3"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","18","28","0","3"

It was just a disappointment to me and I consider it to be not worth what it costs at the moment.\n________________________________________________\n\nI really really really don't know how to feel about Batman Arkham Origins. First of all I was stoked when I heard about it and preordered it as soon as possible. When I got it I locked myself in my room for the entire weekend and played. That at least was my plan, until a couple of bugs appeared that made it impossible to continue playing.\n\nBut by now I've finished it thankfully they quickly came up with patches for the PC version and storywise it was a great game. Unfortunately the story couldn't unfold it's entre potential because the game-play just straight away sucked. Batman no longer moves as fluidly, which is especially annoying when having to deal with larger groups of enemies. The freeflow everyone loved in Arkham Asylum and Arkham City has become no more than a painful itch between your buttcheeks. And do I even have to mention the Electrocutioner?\nFurthermore it felt A LOT like Arkham City. Even the sidemissions were the same. All they really did was to exchange the graphics so it would at least look slightly different\n\nThis game held so many great possibilities, but it's rather poorly made, and I kinda regret having paid 45€ for it.

In his bat-utility belt is a gadget to get him out of nearly any predicament. But in Batman: Arkham Origins, there's one trap Batman can't escape from: the trap of expectations. By now, there are two things that define action in the Arkham series: rhythmic, free-flow combat and stealthy predator rooms. Arkham Origins has those elements in spades. But it doles them out in a straightforward, predictable fashion that lacks the inspiration of the earlier Arkham games.\n\nThe most noteworthy difference between Arkham Origins and its predecessors is a significantly larger open world. But that larger world has little meaning when the things you're doing in it are the same things the smaller world of the previous game accommodated perfectly well. Grappling up to rooftops and gliding through the air still feel great, but they don't feel any better here just because you have more rooftops to leap from. And there are side quests that have you doing things like racing to and fro to disarm bombs set by Anarky, which is much like racing to answer Zsasz's ringing phones in Arkham City.\n\nThe city is bigger just for the sake of being bigger, and while these side quests make interesting use of characters--Anarky's willingness to go to any length to liberate the downtrodden from the oppression of the rich and powerful makes him a fascinating figure, for instance, and the game gives him his due--the things you're doing are exactly the same as the things the previous game had you doing in its open world. Even the crimes in progress, events you can choose to respond to or ignore that come up on the police radio, aren't a chance to protect hapless citizens of Gotham from criminal elements, but just to fight more groups of thugs, something you do plenty of anyway.\n\nFree-flow combat is unchanged from earlier Arkham games, aside from the fact that there are a few new enemy types in the mix, most notably a martial artist who has an attack you need to counter twice rather than once. The animations are still excellent, and getting into a rhythm where you're dishing out punishment while perfectly countering every enemy attack still feels good, but it also feels exactly the same as ever. At a certain point in the game, you acquire shock gloves that make your punches more powerful, but this doesn't prevent punching dudes in the face from feeling routine.\n\nPredator rooms are also what you'd expect them to be, no less and no more. Of course it's still satisfying to sneak up on a goon and take him down silently, or to be perched on a gargoyle, waiting for a clueless criminal to walk right under you so you can do an inverted takedown. But it's also starting to feel rote. By this point, the mechanics governing these systems have become apparent, the process of sneaking up on enemies or of countering attacks overly familiar. You and Batman and the game he's in are all just going through the motions.\n\n8/10\n\n","August 5, 2015","true","19.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

At times you are a hunter in the shadows, timing takedowns and picking apart your prey one by one while remaining invisble. Most of the time you dive into the middle of a gang to rely on quick reflixes and situational awareness to beat the absolute turd out of them.\n\nWhile being very fun and simple Arkham Orgins is basically Arkham City with a lower budget. All but two gadgets are the same, but even then one of the "new" gadgets is really just a reskin. The main story mode is extremely linear, which isn't bad just means less time explorin' more time kickin' booty patooty. It's also unsatisfyingly short. I have no clue what I paid for but with the main story mode complete, every collectable on the lower half of the map safe, and all the sidequests but one completed I only have 35% of the game done. Nothing left but grinding that most people will find boring.\n\nSo final verdict is, if you want to buy it but don't have Arkham City, get Arkham City instead. If you've played Arkham City and crave a bit more go crazy.\n\nP.S. Don't buy the skins. They're poopy. The original skin is bad butt anyways, it tears up as the story progesses (kind of to the point where you wonder how he flipping flys with so many holes in his cape but still awesome.)

Why? Because the hype. I was so excited for this game to come out. I had changed every digital wallpaper I owned to it. Bought posters, digitally made a shirt, hell, the release date was even my phone's passcode. I thought it wise to just wait, and review it when my excitement had died down.\n\nAnd here we are, 5 months later, and I still love this game. Sure, it has it's flooks. But what game doesn't? The gameplay is what you EXPECT, and that's okay! What the Arkham series provides is an unreal superhero experience that makes you feel like YOU are Batman. Arkham Origins still captures that and displays it in a different style and showing of the character. Arkham Origins somewhat takes the old gothic art style of Asylum and City, and sort of hides it away. You know it's there, but it's smothered underneath all the gritty realism. A harsh mix between the Nolan films and Batman: The Animated Series. The art style is also accented by the crisp visuals. and particularly to the PC version, the PhysX. (I love you Pepe) The graphics are unique, and not overly realistic, but at the same time, have that crisp Arkham feel. It knows what it is, and it tries to maintain it. The story is absolutely FANTASTIC, and is really what carries the game... Seriously... Batman fan, or non-Batman fan, you will like the story, ESPECIALLY if you have played Arkham Asylum and Arkham City.\n\nI guess the main gripe most people had with Origins was that it was "more of the same."

It's basically more Batman: Arkham Asylum + Arkham City. If you were a fan of the two previous Arkham games and wanted basically more Batman: Arkham, then Origins certainly delivers just that. If that sounds good to you, great - you'll probably feel right at home with this title. If you wanted and expected more - well, prepare to be disappointed.\n\nArkham Origins' voice-acting is still pretty good, even with some of the changes in some of its cast members. Regardless - the cast delivers and does a great job on their performances. While the story does take a little bit for it to get rolling, once it does - it finally decide to get good. Eight assassins are basically coming for Batman's head, as there's a bounty of $50 million on Batman's head from Black Mask. That's just the start of things, to say the least. There's certainly more to it than that. Because of such a huge cast of characters and some twists + turns in the plot and storyline, some characters - like some of the lesser known Batman villains to most non-fans of the series - never really get the time to get explored and shine here, which feels like a missed opportunity.  Some of Origins' story fills in the blanks of what happened to certain characters, how they become the character they become, or talk about some of their past - explaining some things that happened before events of the previous Arkham games. B/c this is an Origins story, it feels like some of this should've been explored a bit more.\n\nIf you loved the combat of Arkham Asylum + City, it's not really changed much here - and this definitely has always been one of the strengths of this series. Some of the combat feels tweaked, here and there. Plus, there are some new weapons and gadgets here. One of the best things here are the boss fights - which are always excellent here. There certainly are plenty of side missions and collect-a-thon's here, for fans to dive into - if they are digging the game. And if that isn't enough, there's a New Game Plus Mode, among other things to dive into.\n\nAfter 23 hours approximately, Batman: Arkham Origins' single player campaign deliver basically more Batman: Arkham. Fans of the series wanting more Batman: Arkham, that's exactly what you receive here. If you were expecting more, innovations, and major improvements - don't! Origins is not that title. If you want more Batman: Arkham, you'll come away happy with this title. It's certainly a solid game and delivers such an experience. Origins certainly does not touch the greatness and freshness that came from the previous two titles developed by Rocksteady. Though, it can't be denied that WB Montreal has put forth a solid Batman: Arkham game. Fans of the series wanting more Batman: Arkham, that's exactly what you receive here. If you were expecting more, innovations, and major improvements - don't! Origins is just not that title.\n\nFinal Grade = C+.","May 26, 2014","true","28.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Why? Because the hype. I was so excited for this game to come out. I had changed every digital wallpaper I owned to it. Bought posters, digitally made a shirt, hell, the release date was even my phone's passcode. I thought it wise to just wait, and review it when my excitement had died down.\n\nAnd here we are, 5 months later, and I still love this game. Sure, it has it's flooks. But what game doesn't? The gameplay is what you EXPECT, and that's okay! What the Arkham series provides is an unreal superhero experience that makes you feel like YOU are Batman. Arkham Origins still captures that and displays it in a different style and showing of the character. Arkham Origins somewhat takes the old gothic art style of Asylum and City, and sort of hides it away. You know it's there, but it's smothered underneath all the gritty realism. A harsh mix between the Nolan films and Batman: The Animated Series. The art style is also accented by the crisp visuals. and particularly to the PC version, the PhysX. (I love you Pepe) The graphics are unique, and not overly realistic, but at the same time, have that crisp Arkham feel. It knows what it is, and it tries to maintain it. The story is absolutely FANTASTIC, and is really what carries the game... Seriously... Batman fan, or non-Batman fan, you will like the story, ESPECIALLY if you have played Arkham Asylum and Arkham City.\n\nI guess the main gripe most people had with Origins was that it was "more of the same." But I have to ask, is that a bad thing? We got a new art style, amazing story, gadgets, refined predator mechanics and new abilities, a expansion to Gotham, and new playable characters.

The gameplay is brutal, fun and challenging some times. I also think that there is an improvement to Boss Fights. Regarding the Voice Acting, it's a good try by all actors (Troy Baker as Joker, Roger Craig Smith as Batman etc). Finally, the amount of side missions is Substantial.\n\nAnd now let's turn to the Cons:\nGlitches, Glitches ... Glitches..., did I mention GLITCHES?! The biggest problem of this game is the glitches/bugs and the technical issues because they are just so many! Apart from this, Akrham Origins is exactly a copy-paste of Arkham City. It got the same map and nothing new added (+things like gadgets, mission types etc). Also, there are not many Riddles and Challenges.\n\nI would only recommend this game to the fans of DC Comics/Batman Series because they will like it. If this is a new "experience" for you, I'd recommend you not to buy this game (especially in full-price).\n\nOverall Rating: 7/10","June 20, 2015","true","4.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

As someone who has put over a hundred hours into Arkham City and has 100% Arkham City and Asylum, I'm not afraid to say that Arkham Origins is an inferior follow-up. Don't get me wrong, the game is fun; the combat is better than ever with the addition of new enemy types and the ability to stack up to 2 special moves. But besides that there isn't really that much the game has going for it. The predator rooms feel uninspered and generic compared to the ones in City, and can be breezed through with the use of Deathstokes grappel gun which basicly allows you to pick off up to three enemies with no challenge to it: it's basicly a ranged Inverse takedown. This eliminates the diffliculty of predator rooms.\n\nThen there's the city, the game's hub world. While it is larger than the one in Arkham City, if I remember correctly I've been told it's atleast 3 times as big as the one in AC, it feels empty. There isn't much to do apart from stopping the same general street crimes that pop-up in the city districts (whether it's fighting mobs or beating up gangs it all ends up becoming the same repitative task after a while). The are no riddler trophies or riddles that unlock bonuses and give winks and nods to the batman lore. I understand Edward Nigma hasn't transformed into the Riddler yet, but the replecement collectibles they have in the game just feel inferior compared to the collectibles of past games. There are side-missions you can do, but half of them are straight up copies of the ones present in AC; Instead of blowing up titan containers you're blowing up drug containers, there's the one where you get sucked into Mad Hatters Wonderland, there's the one where you have to track down Deadshot just like you did in AC.\n\nSpeaking of Deadshot, one of the biggest flaws in this game is character development. For a game whose whole premise is based around Batman having to defeat eight assassins, the assassins themselves have barely any impact in this game. Assassins like Deathstroke have little to no screen time, they just show-up, you beat them, and you about never see them again. I'm not talking about B or C list characters here, this is Deathstroke, a major player in the DC Universe, a man who has fought the Teen Titans and had multiple comic series. Instead more emphasis is placed on characters like Bane, who has already had screen time in the previous two games. For the most part it just feels like most of the assassins where just there as fan-service instead of actually having a purpose; it's like how people always joke that the Batman story-arc "Hush" was just an excuse for Jim Lee to draw and include major stars of DC universe, with them having little to add to the overall plot.\n\nBut while there's a lot I can criticize about Origins, there are some things it gets right. Like I said earlier the combat is better than ever, not to mention the boss fights, which for the most part, are an improvement over the ones in City and especially Asylum. The voice acting is surprinsgly better than I expected; Troy Baker sounds great as the Joker and overtime Roger Craig Smith starts to grow into the role of Batman, even at some points sounding like a young Kevin Conroy. And while I do think the assassins where underplayed, I'n my opinion James Gordon and Alfred were certainly given the time in the spotlight they rightfully deserve, more so then they were in the past games. But besides that there isn't much I can say good about it.\n\nLike I said from the beginning, Origins is addicting. The comabt is satisfying, I'd dare say even more than City, but it lacks the things AC has that made me 100% it and start on my 5th playthough of it.\n\nIt might just be me, I'll admit that. From what I've read in other reviews people have enjoyed this game, and that's good. But in my opinion, as an honest-to-god Batman/Arkham series fanboy, I just can't recommend this game. I wish I could put it into words that would fully convey my dislike towards this game in a way that would allow you to see it the way I do, but I can't. And when I try the only word that comes to mind is the same one I've repeated over and aver again in my review, and that word is "inferior". This game is just inferior.\n\nBut I'll say again, that's just the way "I" see it. If you think you'll like it, and it comes on sale, you can buy it and make your own opinion. But if you had to ask me, I would not recommend it.\n\nP.S. I couldn't think of anyplace else add this so I just decided to talk about it here, this has to deal with game's New Game Plus mode. Following in AC's footsteps WB Montrel added a New Game Plus mode that allowed you experience the game a second time with an upgraded Batman. But here's the thing, in AC when you started New Game Plus you had all your gadgets unlocked from the start. This was cool because it allowed you an edge with the harder enemies. But in Origins you don't have your gadgets, you have to unlock them all over again. So I have to ask, what's the point of New Game Plus mode if I don't have my unlockables? That was a just a small nitpick I had with the game that I just needed to talk about.","July 19, 2014","false","57.8"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/misspauling/recommended/209000/","misspauling","Cade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/misspauling/","586 products in account","Arkham Asylum came as a breath of fresh air in a genre combination that had left a long trail of mediocre at best games, even when coupled with some of the biggest licenses in the world. Arkham City expanded on that with an open world and a ton more things to do. Can Arkham Origins, the third game in the series, a prequel made by a different developer, keep the same high quality and still make the franchise feel fresh?\n\nThe answer is, thankfully, yes. Though Rocksteady didn't work on this entry in one of the best new franchises in years, WB Montreal has hit it out of the park and convinced me that even if Rocksteady has moved on, WBM's hands are more than capable.\n\nThe game starts out long before the events of Arkham Asylum, and you play as a Batman who's nowhere near as confident. He has no allies aside from Alfred, the criminals of Gotham City still aren't quite sure he's more than a myth or urban legend, and the police force will stop at nothing to take him down. On Christmas Eve, Batman discovers that someone has hired eight assassins to kill him, with a $50 million reward to the one who manages to take him down.\nThe story takes place across Christmas Eve night and a couple hours into the very early morning of Christmas, and it's wonderfully well told, which is good because the story was the most worrying thing to me, since I figured the gameplay looked nearly identical to the past two games.\n\nThe gameplay isn't just a cut and paste of the prior entries, though, with a handful of new gadgets, takedowns, and combat moves thrown in to keep things fresh. Obviously there are some gameplay continuity quirks, since why would Batman have lost some gadgets between now and then, but for the most part you'll forget about those kinds of things as you fight quite a few new enemy types, the best bosses in the series, and use your detective skills to solve crimes with some cool new crime-rewind/fast-forward stuff. It's all very fun and I have no real gameplay complaints, though those expecting radical departures from the series' formulas will be disappointed.\n\nThe non-story stuff is at its best in this entry as well, with cases to solve, criminals to catch, and an enjoyable random crime system to mix things up.\n\nThe only real downsides to AO are negligible. The multiplayer mode is both dead and somewhat pointless, though it could be fun if you could find some games and play with friends. The other issue is that the game, unlike Asylum and City, could use a couple more passes of polish. There are quite a few bugs in this entry, mostly with mission triggers not occurring or enemies becoming unable to be interrogated. Sometimes while rewinding a crime you will become stuck in the ground until it finishes,  things like that. I didn't run into any of the gamebreaking bugs some people have, but I guess your mileage may vary.\n\nAll in all I had a blast with B:AO and I look forward to what both Batman developers have up their sleeves.\n9.5/10","February 11, 2014","true","19.3"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","3"

I've also played both Arkham Asylum, and Arkham City, followed by Origins, all in quick succession and in proper order, over the course of about 3 weeks. I was also (un)lucky to pre-order this game with a decent discount; it cost me about 30€ or so, a good dip from the 50€ that the game retails for.\nAlso have in mind that I will not be talking about the online multiplayer of this game; I feel it is an unnecessary add-on to the game that does not benefit a previously exclusively single-player experience, and a great one at that.\n\nNow, I usually don't tend to compare different games because it takes away the focus of the game at hand, but since this is a sequel (or a prequel, to be precise); a game in a series of games, I shall compare it to its predecessors simply because it makes sense. This goes more so for the quality of the previous games, and to see if this game is up to the same standard. And unfortunately, it is not.\n\nThis game, like many other in their respective franchises, such as God of War and Assassin's Creed just to name a few, suffers from a very common AAA game problem; over-iteration. Companies become greedy due to the success of previous entries, and simply start cashing in on the loyalty of players with a passion for games like this. It should also be noted that this game, unlike Arkham Asylum and City, wasn't even made by the same studio; the first two games were made by Rocksteady, whereas Origins was made by WB Studio Montreal; meaning that the entire cast was changed.\n\nNow, before I can state why I don't recommend this game, I'll take a look at the two previous entries in the series.\n\nBack when I started Asylum, I expected nothing of the game. It is the only game of the three that I have not done any reading on, or have not seen any video material beforehand; I explored as I went.\nA week later, having finished it, and on a side note, it is the only game of the three that I have played on the Easy difficulty (and it still remains the most difficult game in the series), I came out more than pleasantly surprised. Everything, from the game's level design, to its closed, dark, gritty, and almost paranoid atmosphere, not to mention amazing characterization, was spot on. I won't even start talking about the voice acting, which was second to none. The game felt fresh. It felt new. It felt like a really high-quality piece of work.\n\nAfterwards, I almost immediately started Arkham City. With this one, I'd done some previous reading and watched some short videos. The game received almost universal praise, and I read reviews filled with nothing but good word of it. And given the quality of Asylum, I went into the game with high expectations.\nAnother week later, I finished the game, but with mixed feelings. For one, the story seemed out of place, and was kind of messy all around. Other aspects of the game received no change whatsoever; it was basically Asylum with a different story. Luckily, voice acting remained on the same quality level as with Asylum; Hamill really shined with the Joker. Lastly, the game did improve in one aspect. That was the environment. It provided me with a more or less open world, shedding the closed atmosphere of Asylum, and providing me with the constant feeling of being on the move. The design of Arkham City was great, and it was a good change from the closed corridors of the Asylum, and this required a different approach from the player.\nYet, despite all this, I still prefer Asylum. It just felt better.\n\nLastly, I started playing Origins. I had hopes for the game. I wanted to see it correct the things City got wrong; a more coherent story, a larger world to explore, more stuff to do.\nAnd after a while, I saw that the game failed spectacularly at all of these. Now, since I'd harbored nice feelings for the previous games, I could look over the various issues that the game has. However, by the end of the game, I realized that this game was indeed a failure. It is a failure because it takes everything enjoyable from the previous games, and then limits it.\nFor starters, the level design is a step back from Asylum, let alone City. The game basically tricks you into thinking you've been given this large open world, when it fact it is more limited than the closed levels of Asylum, for most of the game. There are only a handful of ways to progress, and the game is not flexible in this aspect. Adding a quick travel feature detracts from the game's supposed exploration-based nature, and you're left to realize that, despite this game having a (slightly) larger map than City, it is barren. The entire city is almost empty, and to make things worse, this is obviously artificial, and on purpose. The game feels poor in content. It even has loading times between areas if you quick travel. It is simply pathetic.\nAnd all of this is made worse by the fact that the game doesn't try to innovate in the slightest. It sticks to the formula of 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it', and it pays for it dearly. Nothing has changed gameplay-wise, and some things are even performed worse than in previous games. The entire system, like City, is simply copy+pasted from Asylum.\nLast but not least when it comes to gameplay, the game has a multitude of bugs. From what I heard and read, I actually got off easy; I only encountered two or three game-breaking bugs over the course of my playthrough. Gameplay aside, there are even more issues with the game. And that would be the story.\n\nSPOILER warning; mild story spoilers ahead.\n\nNow, it might be just me, but the story of Origins feels even more out of place than City. It is cluttered, and makes no time to explain itself, while at the same time letting down my expectations. For one, I expected the Joker's presence in the game to be minimal, even more so than in City. But no. They just went and had to make him the main villain. Again. For the third damn time. Now, all of this would be ok if he was up to par. But even that doesn't occur, as the change in voice actors is visible; while I have nothing against Troy Baker, by trying to be as good as Hamill just doesn't work, and makes the game feel cheap. It is something you'll notice if you played the previous games.\nSecond, the game disappoints in its choice of villains; because the Joker is the main man behind the scenes, this de-values all the other villains, and makes them effectively the Joker's underlings, which is terrible. None of the other villains are given proper screen time, nor are they challenging in fights. This is evident as the game has the worst boss fights in the series. It is a step down from the outright amazing boss fights with Scarecrow and Mr. Freeze, as well as the Penguin in Asylum and City respectively.\nAnd as far as the story goes, the name of the game is misleading. This is no origins story. It is just a half-as*** attempt to cash in on the amazing work of Rocksteady. The story does not feature the true Origins of the Batman, and provides no backstory to his motivation, like Asylum does. It just takes a great character and gives him more stuff to do.\n\nTL;DR - If you simply have to have more of Batman, play the game. However, this game works best if you haven't played any of the previous two games. If you have, and think the series was great so far, for the love of God, don't play this game. If you were a fan of Asylum, stick to it. It is by far the best game in the series, and playing this will only make you dislike the franchise.\n\nAs a side note, this review was longer, but it seems there's a character limit, so I had to shorten it.

The previous interface was intuitive and easy to navigate.  For some reason they decided to change the interface and have made it more difficult, less intuitive and thoroughly unenjoyable.  There are a lot of bugs in this game.  I have had to exit out of the program and start again 3 times today because bugs made Batman unmovable.

As mentioned it doesn't feel as alive as it could be, but it's not a bad looking game by any means. The soundtrack is one of the biggest rewards here. It's a really good one. About what you'd expect from an Arkham game.\n\nThe only thing that keeps Arkham Origins down is that so much of it feels like a retread of familiar territory. There's nothing here that really tries to build on the foundation of what was already established in the game before it. Arkham City did a good job of building up on what was established in Asylum despite having a lot of familiar gameplay. It feels like the developers here were playing it safe.\n\nThe good news is that Origins isn't a step back. It's just not a big step forward. It does have it where it counts, though. A strong story and a good narrative to accompany it. If you liked the previous Arkham games then Origins is worth your time.","October 27, 2013","true","32.5"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","23"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TallButShort/recommended/209000/","TallButShort","Poomar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TallButShort/","391 products in account","Arkham Origins is the third game in the Batman Arkham series, though it is a prequel. It is obvious when playing through the game that the developer of this game is different than the previous two installments, Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. The game feels clunkier and is not as well optimized but the game still has a sort of charm that drives through, which makes it a unique, though flawed, addition to the series.\n\nThe story in this game caught me by surprise because of how honestly interesting it was. The game takes place on Christmas Eve and features the first night Batman encounters The Joker. There is a twist that happens during the beginning of the game, but do not expect anything of Arkham City caliber. The character interactions are fantastic and honestly my favorite part of the game, especially the relationship portrayed between Bruce and Alfred. To see the beginnings of many characters and their involvement with The Dark Knight is interesting as well, including Officer Gordon and Barbara Gordon. Many parts of the story actually portrays Batman as a ture detective, which is very well done and satisfying.\n\nThe voice acting in this game is pretty solid, even thought the actors Batman and The Joker have both been replaced. Troy Baker must be commended for his outstanding job as The Joker and filling in the big shoes left by the much talented Mark Hamill. A huge negative for me though is how awful the lipsyncing in real time is in this game. It looks extremely clunky, unfinished, and just plain bad, especially by 2013 video game standards. The cutscenes, on the other hand, are a big plus because they are extremely stylized and are a huge factor that sets this game apart from the previous installments in the series.\n\nThe graphics in this game are nothing special and even when they are maxed out, they do not look as good as Arkham City does. That said, it is definitely not a bad looking game (though the fire effects are absolutely atrocious). The funny thing is even though the game came out two years after Arkham City and does not look as good, it also does not run as well. I have a pretty solid PC which can run games such as Battlefield 4 on high smoothly and at a constant framerate but for this game, it manages to lag (though not frequently) at random locations throughout the game, and especially prominent during the last couple portions,\n\nThe gameplay in this game consists of what you have already been accustomed to in the series, except it just seems to be a bit clunkier. Though the flow of the combat is fluid, sometimes the takedown controls did not seem to work which got quite annoying in specific portions of the game. Also, the combat in this game is much easier than the other games because once you get a flow going, which is easy enough, you can attack enemies that are stunned and already on the ground which somewhat removes one of the only challenges in the beat-em-up combat this series did so well. There is a return of stealth portions within the game but it plays quite differently because of the very different level design compared to the previous installments. In this game, the stealth portions really just seemed easier and if you are caught sneaking around, it was also simple enough to dodge the enemies' bullets and take them down non-stealthily, which honestly should not be the case. So one of the biggest gripes about this game is the fact that it is really a lot easier than Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. There are also many new weapons introduced in this game, which does not make sense since Batman could have used them in the other installments, which take place later on the timeline. Though when making a prequel videogame, it is inevitable to run into problems like that. One of my favorite additions though is the grapple accelerator, which allows Batman to increase his speed when grappling on to any surface, which happens a lot in these games. This is one feature I definitely want to see carried over into Arkham Knight.\n\nThe map in this game is slightly bigger than that of Arkham City, though it may feel emptier because of the lack of interesting and engaging sidequests. The game takes place in Gotham this time around and it does not make a whole lot of sense since the only people we see roaming the streets or the rooftops are criminals. It made sense in Arkham City, since that is an entire area infested with criminals, but the same cannot be said about this game. One great addition though is the fast-travel using the Batwing. There are multiple fast-travel spots that can be unlocked throughout the map and this idea works very well and I hope it is implemented into Arkham Knight.\n\nThough the game is still pretty fun, even compared to the first two installments, it is lacking something huge. A variety of Batman villains. We get some interesting bosses in this game but we also get some fairly unenjoyable ones with villains I don't really care about. Arkham City had an assortment of crazy and fun villains, but this game takes a slump in that department. Bane returns for a total of three different boss battles here and though they are fairly fun, it would have been more interesting to change up the formula. There is a boss battle with Deathstroke early in the game and it is very well executed, and one of the highlights in this game for me. One thing to note is that one of the boss battles is very annoying to play with a mouse and keyboard, so using a controller for this game may be a good idea.\n\nOverall, Batman: Arkham Origins is a solid game muddled by being unpolished and some poor design. However, it is still a good game in my opinion and one that is worthy to be in the series. WB Montreal did a good job at portraying these characters in a new light and I really appreciate that.\n\n7.5/10\n\n","June 17, 2015","true","11.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

And on batman's way the police is trying to capture him . I enjoyed every part of it honestly . It was interesting how you deafeat everyone of them successively .\n\nGameplay Batman Arkham Origins is an open world stealth game . You play as Batman as well . You have many gadgets which really makes you feel like Batman .\nWhen you free roam you use your batclaw to attach to buildings and you can also glide in the air . You also use your other gadgets like cryptographic sequencer which hacks security consoles by guessing the password (which I find really annoying as it was in the previous games), batarang which you throw at enemies (also you can choose remote controlled batarang which you controll), explosive gel - destroying weak walls and lots more gadgets which you also get by deafiting the assassins .\nWhen you free roam there are side missions like crime in progress where you help the police from the gangs . There are also Most Wanted missions where you do the side missions of a villian such as Anarky who plants bombs around or Enigma who has data files hidden around (also in levels) . When you stop these side missions you earn points which can be used to upgrade your gadges and etc.\nThe combat is great but really easy (you pretty much do the same - just pressing some buttons) . The whole game didn't have a lot new stuff from Arkham City except one - the world . Its double the size of Arkham City .\nThe boss fights are amazing . The first one which was Deathstroke showed me what Arkham Origins offers with its boss fights.\n\nIssues I honestly enjoyed the game a lot, but then the holy experience of glitches began . I even made a countdown for how many glitches/bugs I found and they were 11-12 . I had a glitch/bug in almost every level . I found solutions for them in the internet (well some of them still persist) . Wb Games doesnt give a ♥♥♥♥ about the game after they realised it .There are missing data handlers, glitches while you glide, some glitches that you just fall and when you get up everything is white and you have unlimited gliding, beatdown glitches (I thought the game was on ubisoft), corrupted save files (mostly on xbox), game-breaking glitches, crashes and a lot more .\n\nVerdict After all these issues I do recommend the game for its awesome storyline, amazing boss fights, great world and all these gadgets that makes you feel like Batman.\n\nIssues fixes Here are some fixes which MIGHT help you.\nCorrupted Save Files - Reinstall the game  .\nStartup Crash - Go to BatmanArkhamOrigins > SinglePlayer > BMGames > Config and delete BmEngine\nElevator Glitch - immediately after you press SPACE (elevator button) press Z (first person view) and you shouldn't fall from the elevator\nGlide bug - Press Ctrl while gliding and then space\nJoker Beatdown glitch - Low your graphics and turn your wi-fi off\nMissing Enigma data handler on the pioneer bridge - Restart the last checkpoint and then fast travel to the BatCave and then go back to the enigma data handler and he should be there","July 5, 2015","true","60.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

The real center of these games is hand-to-hand combat with large groups of thugs. That's what you'll be spending a large portion of the game doing, and it's never been more frustrating.\n\nIn past games, you were able to cancel out of any long animation Batman might be in the middle of in order to counter an attack coming from a thug behind you. In this game, not only do your animations have priority over your commands, but enemies can slide from a good distance away right up next to you to lay a sudden smack-down on the Bat, the whole while you are helpless to defend yourself. This makes the "Bat sense" warning signals above enemies' heads useless at least half of the time, since it will be impossible for you to counter them.\n\nThis is more or less emblematic of the problems with Arkham Origins: changes were made that make little sense and do a lot to detract from the experience. There's some fun to be had here for anyone desperate for more Batman after Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, but if you can hold out, you'd be better off waiting for Arkham Knight next year.","October 24, 2014","false","31.8"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","17","28","0","0"

That being said I didn't run around getting all the Riddler boxes to beat him up for a third time.  But the main story is considerably shorter than that of Arkham City, and it ends sort of abruptly.  (Yes, yes you can continue playing after you finish the story to get the Riddler stuff.)\n\n2) The writing seems half-♥♥♥♥♥.  The assassins that were hired to kill Batman, which I might add were the main marketing point for the game made up less than an hour of the game.  The concept of surviving the assassins in one night sounded appealing, the actual execution was boring and short.  It's almost the same issues the Batman films ran into all those years ago, when you have too many interesting characters there just isn't time for everyone.\n\n3) The game is Riddled (heh, pun) with bugs.  From the buggy controls to the performance issues, all the way to that inescapable Riddler room that you actually had to fast-travel your way out of.  I played for 3/4 of this game on the highest settings with a decently high-end rig (i7, 16GB, HD 7970).  I had performance hits here and there, but as soon as I got to Blackgate the game became unplayable, and for no reason in particular.  Looking at performance monitors, my card was itting at 80% usage, my i7 was barely being touched and yet I was struggling to get 14 fps.   I had to look online for community fixes.  Though these are known issues, they have yet to be fixed.\n\n4) Yes the map is roughly "double" the size of Arkham city, but there were sections of the map that I barely explored because there wasn't a need.  It was big just for the sake of being big.\n\n5) While the boss-fights in the Batman series have never been anything special (with the exception of Mr. Freeze) the fights in this game are spectacularly vanilla.  I was looking forward to the Deathstroke fight, and it was over in seconds, more of a chore than a challenge.\n\n6) The gadgets are a joke.  The “glue grenade” is a clone of Arkham City’s “freeze grenade” with a new name but all the exact same functionality.\nFor some reason there is stun grenade… thing that you’ll probably forget that you have because it’s less effective than any of your other gadgets.\n\nThere is more, but you get the idea.  With as little actual story was in this game it could have done as an expansion to Arkham City or been incorporated into whatever the next Batman game that Rocksteady is working on all hush-hush.\n\n**I must say though that this game as a whole was disappointing the one part I was surprised by was the voice acting.  I wasn't sure of their decision to swap in new voice actors for that "younger" sound.  While neither of the main characters sounded particularly younger they did do a damn fine job of bringing the characters to life.\n","January 21, 2014","false","26.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/recommended/209000/","dons20","TRU±PlayMaker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/","569 products in account","IntroductionBatman: Arkham Origins is the third game in an amazing series which combines fun and proactive combat with a massive city full of secrets. If you have already played Arkham City or Asylum then you're getting more of the same, though there are many elements of the game (mainly story and characters) that are different because Origins is a prequel to the series.\n\nPlot DetailsYou are The Batman, a highly trained combat expert with an arsenal full of gadgets at your disposal. However, Gotham City doesn't really know about you at this point in time. You go from just a rumor to a full-fledged night vigilante in the space of (what should be) a night. I find it a bit ridiculous to be honest, but hey, that's just my opinion. Basically you become 'wanted' by this guy called Black Mask who puts a pretty impressive bounty on your head and hires assassins to kill you, 10 of them in fact. At first this premise really got me interested, but I didn't feel like the story was carried as well as it could be. Nevertheless, you get to meet some of the most infamous criminals of Gotham in a younger version. It was weird seeing Penguin a little younger than usual.\n\nAll of this happens on Christmas eve by the way. As you traverse the city, you'll see a lot of snow, christmas trees and assorted lights everywhere. Let's talk more about Gotham shall we?\n\nGameplayGotham City is pretty much the same from Arkham City. It's large with various major areas you can travel to. You can decide to grapple and glide everywhere, or you can now fast travel via the batplane. I do appreciate the choice between them both, however the Batplane travel is just a combination of three cutscenes that never vary. I prefer physically going through the city, finding cool grappling spots and just enjoying the game that way. BUt when I simply wanted to get somewhere quickly, the fast travel system helped a lot.\n\nThe problem I have with the city is that aside from enemies, it is completely empty. Remember the plot? Well it just so happens that there is a supposed curfew in effect for the entire night and so you'll never see a single regular human being anywhere. This is something I had hoped Arkham Origins would have fixed from City, but alas, we have to deal with another lifeless city. Almost any person you see is automatically an enemy because the cops aren't even on your side. The exception to this rule are the people you end up rescuing in various situations. They may thank you and leave, but otherwise they pretty much don't exist.\n\nThere are quite a few things to do in the city itself. From beating up baddies to finding collectibles, this game will eat away time like acid. Combat is quite satisfying and will involve a lot of countering, utilizing gadgets and changing your strategy to deal with various enemies. Stealth gameplay is quite fun and it's highly entertaining to listen to the voice chatter of terrified enemies. Gadgets give you so many creative ways of taking out, or immobilizing enemies, so no two encounters are ever the same.\n\nNow, I dislike doing repetitive things, however there are two things that kept me interested in getting collectibles. Firstly, most of these collectibles are tied to some very creative puzzles. Each one kept me guessing and some of them absolutely blew my mind. However I never once had to pull up a guide to tell me how to solve any of them so most people should be able to get them all with enough time. Secondly, I enjoyed reading the new bits of information I got from each collectible I got. It put more life into the characters and was pretty worth it.\n\nThere are many other gameplay elements which are worth mentioning but it would make this review too long.\n\nVisualsAbsolutely stunning. If your PC can max this out then that's perfect. However this game is very well optimized for even potato PCs.\n\nAudioThere are a few new voice actors in this game and while I thought they did their roles just fine, I'd still prefer the originals. Other sounds and music are top quality stuff. Highly enjoyable.\n\nSummaryWhile Arkham Origins is a great game in its own right, it feels like the developers missed multiple opportunities to expand the game past the original despite the plot. Arkham City felt a bit lifeless and this game would have done well with some expansion in that regard. Instead, it felt the same, if not worse in that category. However, Arkham Origins is overall more of the same from Arkham City, so if you liked that game, or you're new to the franchise, you'll love it.\n\nNewcomers: 9/10 - Worth a buy\nPrevious players: 7/10 - More of the same\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

The story is really cheesy and kind of silly, the gameplay is solid and well-rounded but feels a little off. The game also commits one of the cardinal sins of gaming and throws a last boss that is entirely different from the rest of the game at you. I enjoyed my time here and got some good mileage out of the game, but Arkham City and Arkham Asylum are incredible compared to this. It is worth a five to ten dollar purchase, and you'll have a good time with it, but it feels hollow compared to Asylum/City.\n\nTimeline wise, this takes place before Asylum, and tells a bit of the origin story, hence the name.","October 28, 2014","true","26.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

Gotham City on Christmas Eve just screams “Batman Returns” and is iconic in its own right.\nThe character design and graphics are top notch, from the major (and minor) villains to the skyscrapers of Gotham.\nCharacter animations are fluid and natural, especially in cutscenes. Copperhead, one of the eight assassins gunning for Batman, is the real standout in this aspect.\nThe gameplay is a rehash of the previous Arkham games, with the now standard attack/counter/stun/gadget methodology in place. The combat has always been a strength of the series, and Arkham Origins is no different, except to make Batman’s combat seem less refined and more brutal. That they managed to convey Batman’s inexperience to crime fighting through his fighting technique alone is fantastic.\nDetective mode is now more involved, requires more evidence gathering, and *GASP* actually involves Batman having Alfred send the evidence to the GCPD for prosecution! It’s almost like the real world! #SARCASM\nThe plot twist, while obvious to anyone who was vaguely familiar with a Batman plot past his Detective Comics days, was a welcome change of pace.\nThe voice acting, despite having changed actors from the previous Arkham games, was still solid and believable.\nThe “Red Hood” section. I won’t spoil it more than that, but as a fan of the comic series, this made me very happy.\nThe Bad:\n\nThis game was shipped by WB Montreal one week prior to Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag. What this means in layman’s terms was that WB Montreal had NO wiggle room in their release date, since Assassin’s Creed (also being a stealth action/combat game with an enhanced vision mode) would almost certainly have cannibalized their sales. In business terms, they had to ship before Assassin’s Creed no matter what state the game was in – AND IT SHOWS. A number of game breaking bugs were present in both the single player and multiplayer portions of the game, including:\nNOTE: MINOR SPOILERS BELOW\nMultiple instances where ledges that appeared to be climbable were not. One instance occurred in Burnley Tower, after the Riddler closes off the only other exit, leaving your trapped inside the Tower FOREVER… or until you fast-travel out or reset the game. If you have time and appreciate nerd rage, just Google “Burnley Tower”.\nAn instance where pulling a raft in a dream-like sequence lead to being unable to drop the rope or reach the other shore. Infinite falling in certain places in the map, which really broke the immersion of the game somehow. If Batman ever runs into an enemy which can actually do this, he’s screwed.\nNo level or stat saving in multiplayer, which is a non-starter for obvious reasons.\nFunky physics. More than once, I threw a baddie against a wall at just the right angle to make him go spirally hundreds of feet into the air. But even worse, once he landed, he got back up! Which is JUST impossible.\nOccasionally, you are detected by criminals from whom you have both cover and distance. Conversely, you can fly just overhead of others and go completely unnoticed.\nBatman sometimes drops combos for no reason, particularly during counters.\nThere was a lack of emphasis on stealth for most of the game, and often going into stealth areas, Batman enters the room through the front door. Perhaps the enemies were expecting the vents, so the door was the most stealthy option?\nMINOR SPOILERS: In what is probably the worst tragedy of storytelling in this series, Barbara Gordon is portrayed as an enthusiastic teenager who somehow is allowed to access confidential police files and evidence because her daddy works for the police. Brushing aside the lack of realism there, Barbara Gordan, who became Batgirl and then, after the Joker shot her in the spine, assumed the role of Oracle, was NOT the airhead from this game. I almost stopped playing for this reason alone.\nThe method of unlocking certain gadgets and techniques is dependent on performing certain feats. Normally that is fine, except that these feats are very specific and must be performed in the exact order that the skill tree describes. And some of these feats are nightmarishly impossible and require specific areas and circumstances to complete… just leave it at XP, WB Montreal. Come on.\nThe Grapnel Accelerator, described as “experimental” in Arkham City, is mysteriously present years before in Arkham Origins. I understand why they decided to include it, but it represents an obvious break in the timeline of the games.\nThe multiplayer… oh the multiplayer. It requires eight people to play, real people. NOT BOTS. NO BOTS. Good luck finding eight people on the servers a month from now. Make some friends on Steam, get a group together, and it might be feasible. Otherwise, it’s a waste of install space. Also, the shooting is really hit-and-miss, but that makes sense in an engine designed for hand-to-hand combat.\nCan you play it while the children are awake?:\n\nOf course not. Corpses with rictus smiles, tons of on-screen violence, multiple murder\nscene investigations, psychopathic villains… I could go on. Then again, if you are looking\nfor a creative way to punish them…\n\nWhile I’m picking nits…\n\nRocksteady better be working on something damned important… like freelance work on\nHalf-Life 3, or (dare I wish it?) a good Superman game. I know that sounds impossible,\nbut before Arkham Asylum, there wasn’t a good Batman game, either. I would only\nrecommend this game if you haven’t played Arkham Asylum or Arkham City, and thus\ncan’t compare the quality. Or if you have enemies, you could recommend this game on\nits multiplayer strengths.\n\nDid I make time to complete it?:\n\nI put 26 hours into it, primarily into the single player. I know that’s incongruous with\nmy criticisms above, but I was a big fan on the franchise going into Arkham Origins.\nThis also represents the smallest amount of time I have put into an Arkham game, and\nnone of the others had multiplayer. I should also mention that a number of the bugs\nmentioned above have been fixed… but not all.\n\nRecommended Purchase Price:\n\n$19.99 (so, maybe Steam Summer Sale 2014?)\n\nor\n\n40% of current retail value of $49.99\n\nReviewer:\n\nRod Kimble\n\nhttp://www.gamerglance.com","December 3, 2013","false","2.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/209000/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","213 products in account","As a young studio best known for porting Batman: Arkham City to Wii U, WB Montreal must have been desperate to prove that it belongs in the same conversation as series creator Rocksteady Games. To its credit, it's hard to tell that Batman: Arkham Origins isn't one of its sister studio's earlier releases. That's some achievement, but it's also a mixed blessing.\n\nTo begin with, the set-up is as economical as Arkham Asylum or Arkham City. Batman is thrust into Gotham on Christmas Eve after Black Mask puts a $50 million bounty on his head and invites eight super-villains to town to compete for the spoils. As with previous Arkham games, that simple set-up then evolves as Batman races to keep up with events.\n\nArkham Origins doesn't leave the strongest first impression though. After a CG cutscene and a short playable prologue in Blackgate Prison, Batman is dumped into a sparsely occupied Gotham that looks tiny on his Batcomputer map compared to some of the open-world playgrounds we've run around in lately. You're free to travel across it all from the start, but players used to maps dripping with icons may be surprised at its cold emptiness.\n\nThis isn't a game that lacks depth, though - it's just a game with rare patience. Story missions take place away from the streets in carefully knotted set-piece levels built around single locations - like Penguin's hidden casino-♥♥♥-arms-bazaar or Gotham City Police headquarters - and as you make progress the open world gradually fills up with distractions.\n\nThe initial slow burn is welcome, anyway, because it's an opportunity to luxuriate in the wonderful systems and mechanics that Arkham Origins inherits from its forebears. Batman glides through levels even when he's just walking around, those famous bat ears erect with authority, and he moves fluidly in a crouched run, too, barrel-like thighs pumping him from shadow to vent. But when you start actually gliding, it's a minor revelation, opening his wings to the wind and using the grapple to grasp the edge of a distant chimney, reeling it in and launching him over the crest to continue his flight.\n\n\nWatch me play through the first level of Arkham Origins and provide an overview of some of the systems.\nWe had all this before, of course, but you forget how good it was. The same goes for Batman's many gadgets. You start off with quite a few - batarangs, smoke pellets and explosive gel for blowing holes in walls - and of course you have detective vision, the sonar view mode that maps Batman's surroundings so he can track enemies as they move nervously through the darkness around him. You gain other toys at intervals, including the remote batclaw for setting up tightropes between particular grapple points.\n\nBatman remains handy in a fight, too. In hand-to-hand combat, a single attack button allows him to flow between targets, ducking and diving through dense matrices of incoming blows, repelling those that threaten to land by reaching for the counter button. It's still quick to build combos, and the final blow, which the game always puts into slow motion and frames up nicely, often has a satisfying crack to it.\n\nThe one thing Batman still lacks is a gun or grenade to deal with unsuspecting groups of enemies from afar - he can either wade in with his fists and gizmos or try to isolate and pick them off using stealth - but of course that's the point of the character. There is still a slight frustration though that the game often forces you into direct confrontation rather than letting you choose your own approach, especially as tougher enemies arrive with riot shields, knives and body armour to inject complexity into each fight.\n\nStill, that is what Arkham Asylum and Arkham City did, so at least it's canon. As is the way the city starts to fill up with intriguing diversions. The Riddler is back, of course, custodian of unlockable fast-travel points that can only be activated when you break into them. This often involves hopping around adjacent buildings examining the exterior of your prize, like a high-tech octopus feeling around the outside of a bottle to reach the fish inside. Enigma has left his mark in other areas of Gotham, too, and you'll be on his various trails all night.\n\nHe is probably the highlight of the side missions - again, as usual - although he's far from alone in the dark night. Anarky is fed up with Gotham's corrupt rulers and plans to deal with them somewhat more explosively than Batman, so that's a thing, and there are various other threads to follow once secondary characters - friends and foes - present themselves.\n\n2\nManoeuvring around enemies to set up stealth takedowns is still fun, although you can autopilot a lot of it with two games' experience under your utility belt.\nSo it's fun crawling over Gotham. It can still feel slightly empty at times - you'll never see a pedestrian who isn't a cheesy thug or a trigger-happy SWAT team member - but among the dark rooftops, smokestacks, red brick facades and Ace Chemicals billboards there emerges plenty to do, and I am loath to scold a game for rebelling against the fad of instant gratification. Besides, some of it is there from the start should you be paying attention. There are a host of character-building challenges to complete, for example, by doing things like performing certain combinations in combat or gliding through rings dotted around the city. These tasks are just sitting there quietly listed in one of the pause menus.\n\nThe one area where Arkham Origins truly distinguishes itself from Rocksteady's work, of course, is the part of the game that UK studio Splash Damage developed: multiplayer.\n\nIn Arkham Origins' online mode, three of Bane's mercenaries face off against three of Joker's gang across four maps, fighting over capture points and trying to kill the opposition until they no longer have any Battlefield-style respawn tickets left and can be wiped out.\n\nAs well as limited-use knockoff versions of Batman's see-through-walls detective vision, and loadouts that can be customised with unlockable weapons and abilities such as an explosive RC blimp, each team can also call on their master when they hit a certain threshold. Bane has powerful melee attacks, while Joker has a pair of pistols good for one-shot kills and spamming explosives.\n\nThe biggest twist, though, is that two other players control a third team of heroes. Yes! Someone gets to play as Batman! (And Robin.) The heroes have a suite of predatory tools including grapple hooks and various batarangs and can stalk their prey from underground passages as well. They are rewarded for performing a variety of takedowns.\n\nDespite the competing objectives, matches are simple to understand and often draw to a nervous conclusion, as Bane and Joker's teams run out of respawn tickets and try to pick each other off while the heroes circle. If a player takes out a hero at this stage, their downed team-mates retake the field, while heroes who die in this endgame lose much of their score.\n\nThings can yo-yo very quickly, and while this can mean that the preceding drama feels as though it's more for show than anything, it's tense and exciting every time, and really does result in gang members waving their guns around at the shadows in terror, just as it should.\n\nIt's a fair amount of fun, then, but it's also the kind of mode you will enjoy for an evening rather than a lifetime. Taken on those terms, it's a welcome inclusion.\nThey also feed into Batman's tech tree, although this is one of the weaker areas of Arkham Origins. Batman is already well outfitted and his most useful additions - like the shock gloves, which allow him to power up electrical items and rain fizzly blows down in combat - are rewarded for making progress in the story, so I generally just invested my XP in tougher armour, which is a bit boring. Tech trees where you find yourself rooting around for the least uninspiring upgrade are always disappointing,","May 26, 2015","true","8.0"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

I would suggest to get it if only you truly loved Arkham City.\n\nThis game feels like DLC to Arkham City, nothing is really new (except few gadgeds, but some of them are pretty trivial - glue grenade that does exactly the same as freeze grenade in AC...), it is a prequel to AC therefore every piece of history that you have found in AC will be here (Blackmask, Mr Freeze (paid DLC!), Calendar Man, Croc etc.).\n\nStories are interesting, I will not deny that. But it feels repetetive - there is no element of suprise cause most of the stuff you have already seen in AC. Fight system is the same, there are some new enemies but very few (like 1? or 2?).\n\nMap is bigger, it has a bridge to new part of Gotham, which was unavailable in AC. There is also fast travel (which was lacking in AC) which is "a must be" in recent games.\n\nTo sum up, I feel dissatisfied. I thought I will get a game that will blow me away but instead I get game that feels like AC DLC. There was a huge gap (positive one) between Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. Comparing 2 last productions I would say AO is worse :(. Buy this game only if love Batman universe or if you have loved Arkham City or if it's dirt cheap during sales (was -75% already).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/209000/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","Let me clarify two things before moving forward with this review:\n1) I have not encountered one single bug / glitch throughout the game during my playthrough. Perhaps one thing could be mentioned: Batman occasionally does some strange movements once in the air whilst gliding. But when you stop it and do the gliding again it is fine. So, I have to assume that by the time I played this game WB had patched it properly eliminating all (or most) of the annoying issues.\n2) I have not tried multiplayer out, at all. I just didn't care. This franchise is all about the single player experience for me and after completing the story I moved on to other games simply skipping the multiplayer component. So, whether good or bad, I do not know and my review is based on the single player experience.\n\nAdditional criticism towards Arkham Origins (beside the handful of glitches) was its incremental nature. So, while Arkham City offered a couple of new things Origins does not do so. Media cited it should have been a more transformative sequel. But why? It prepares Arkham Knight for that - Rocksteady will do that (we already know vehicles have more involvement in the new Batman game), in the meantime, Splash Damage simply picked a working formula and created a game with that.\n\nWith that in mind Arkham Origins has one new thing: its story. This is now a prequel so Batman is just after his disappearance (the journey during which he honed his skills) and just started apprehending the bad guys of Gotham. Police, at this point, do not trust him (meanly because they fear him and another reason for that is them being corrupt). Of course, we have Gordon as the outstanding, good, by-the-book guy who can accept Batman (albeit he is making this decision reluctantly). So, it's interesting to be there from the "beginning" and see - for instance - how difficult it is for Batman to cope with Joker (he's quite worked up after their first encounter). I liked the story and I liked the new villains - Black Mask, for instance, or the assassins he hired to kill Batman.\n\nSo, in essence, the game offers the same thing, but instead of Arkham we are in Gotham City. This is quite huge (perhaps even bigger than Arkham); there's the usual riddle trophies we can collect and many side missions. Also, there are a lot of cutscenes and one thing I found very interesting: Both Batman's and Joker's voice actor changed, but they do a very good job indeed! You can barely hear the difference (yes, even Mark Hamill's replacement is that good).\n\nI found the game a bit more difficult. You need to act much faster and there's a new enemy type who can counter Barman moves so you need to counter the counter (it makes sense, right?). Some predator challenges can be annoying as if you mess with the bad guys one by one there's always one who grabs a hostage and if he sees you he simply eliminates the victim resulting in a game over. So, even these encounters require a bit more focus.\n\nI do not know about the DLCs (I understand there's one with titled Cold, Cold Heart and it is with Freeze) but the core story is really good and the game offers a long-lasting experience just like its predecessors. Perhaps Origins sticks out a bit; this will be even more alarming probably once Arkham Knight is released; in the meantime, let's just enjoy this installment which I believe is an important part of the franchise and true fans of the series should not skip this one.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nCold, Cold Heart DLC - The downloadable content pits Batman against Mr Freeze. We have an extra 4-5 hour long single player content that is to be launched separately from the main menu. After completing the introduction section we find ourselves in Gotham once more with "all gadgets available". I guess all gadgets means all you have obtained in the main game. There is no levelling up and only a relatively small section of the city is available as a playable are.\n\nStill, the DLC content offers a new enemy, a new boss battle and exciting cutscenes. I like how Batman faces a frozen Gotham - the snow / ice effect on his cape is brilliant. And of course completing the story still allows us to go back and pick-up the remaining collectibles. This is a good DLC - while for 10 bucks it may be a bit expensive if discounted true Batman fans must get it!","April 30, 2014","true","57.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Need I say more? Just don't expect the improvements like Asylum to City, since it isn't Rocksteady. I wish WB had been more daring with it, it's like they were too scared to alienate fans instead of trying out new things. Don't expect anything terribly fresh. It's largely a copy and paste of Arkham City, which, don't get me wrong, isn't a bad thing. Unfortunately the few changes they did make frustrate the heck out of me. I'll update if I find anything else, but I think I've explored most of the games mechanics by now.\n\nPros:\n\nBoss fights: Bossfights are fantastic, infinitely better than rocksteady's to be honest, well, a few of them. (poison ivy anyone?) I've had a few so far, but the Deathstroke and Shiva fights were fantastic. Copperhead as well, can't wait to see what comes next. I loved the challenge, and getting the perfect completion trophies was a great was to test my skills. Few generic fights that every game has, but overall they've been great.\n\nOpen world: lots of enemies, plenty to explore. Alot of the side missions are unlocked by story progression, so expect to be locked into that. If you liked the design of City, it carries into here.\n\nCrimes in Progress: I love these. Usually a tough group of enemies, nice difficulty, just don't expect to wrack up good combos without mashing dodge 24/7 (see below)\n\nCons: (so far)\n\nCombat: I wish they had copy and pasted it. I wish. Enemies are extremely aggressive, and youll often find yourself being punched in the face while trying to perform a simple strike, and since batman moves in slow mo you cant hit and counter in time. If you played Arkham City to death like I did, youll notice. It's not obvious, but any veteran of those series will feel the slight change. Its ridiculously frustrating how hard it is to maintain any sort of combo without mashing dodge and striking once. The thugs will teleport punch to you, so even if you use freeflow to move 10 feet away, he'll somehow still hit you. I cant even batclaw slam without being punched in the middle of the slam and they weren't anywhere nearby. Really?\n\nEDIT: i tried out the combat challenge mode, and the combat feels totally different. Very quick and responsive, felt even faster than it was in previous Arkham iterations. (Deathstroke is so fast i can barely follow how fast he strikes in focus flow) Not sure why its so different.\n\nCollectibles: Scan tags, collect data packs, batarang network relays, interrogate informers. All a copy of different systems used in Arkham City and Harley Quinn DLC. I wouldnt mind but its all so mindless, I've yet to encounter a single challenging puzzle like I did in City. Got all the collectibles in City and had a blast. Here it feels like a chore.\n\nFlying: I often find it really difficult to simply shoot to the top of a building and boost past. It likes to select the fire escape on the side of the building and makes it incredibly frustrating to get anywhere quickly. And expect alot of flying around, since you cant unlock all the fast travel points from the get go and the drop points can be rather far from the edge of district.\n\nUpgrade Trees: I hate these. I hate these with a passion. I get it, its Batman starting out, he has to learn. Anyone who has experience with poorly designed upgrade trees knows what I'm talking about. Oh yeah, by the way, you HAVE to complete challenges in game to get some of the gagdets. They aren't too hard, but it took too long to get my damn sonic batarang.\n\nIt's a great game, if you loved Asylum and City you'll enjoy it, just don't expect anything too amazing. Hopefully Knight will remedy all the mistakes here.","March 29, 2014","true","37.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Arkham Origins takes the gameplay mechanics from Arkham City - the responsive freeflow fighting mechanic demonstrating just how badass Batman is and the tightly coordinated predator rooms that allow multiple approaches - and combines it with a great storyline. If you enjoyed Arkham City, you'll enjoy this game.\n\nThe gameplay isn’t much different from Arkham City. You’ll have some new/replaced items, some new enemy types are introduced, the city has been expanded and they added a new detective mini-game. Ultimately, these are only minor changes from the solid base that Arkham City created. The game doesn’t offer the revolutionary changes that Arkham City did compared to Arkham Asylum, but rather expands on it.\n\nThe story features both well-known (Joker, Penguin, Bane) as lesser-known characters (Firefly, Shiva, Deadshot). Not every character is part of the main story, so it is advised to try and play the Most Wanted side missions for the full experience. The well-crafted Mad Hatter stage deserves a playthrough.\n\nAt the time of writing, it appears WB patched most of the bugs. During my three playthroughs (new game, new game+ and I am the night mode, 100%, roughly 70 hours), as well as during the Cold Cold Heart DLC, I experienced only a single non-game breaking bug. This is coming from an inherently more bug-prone Crossfire system. You’ll see most negative reviews because of bugs are pre January 2014.\n\nTraditional rating: 8/10","July 19, 2014","true","106.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

On the one hand its a very solid title.  Despite it being an obvious cash in on the Arkham series because WB couldn't wait for Knight to reach store shelves it still offers a lot of Batman kicking ♥♥♥ enjoyment.  The thing is people are very divisive about this game.  Either its the best in the series or its the worst.  Its just City with a new paint job don't kid yourselves.  City perfected the formula and Origins just came in and said why fix what ain't broke?\n\nThe gameplay is so similar to City that you wouldn't even know a difference if it was an expansion pack.  The gadgets feel more gimmicky when in previous games they had a practical application.  The remote claw replaces the line launcher and while its amusing it also makes predator sections even more brainlessly easy when they were already easy.  Who needs to actually stealthily take down baddies with guns when you can hook them to things and each other and take out 5/6 of the room without even moving?  On the flipside combat seems to have gotten harder with counters being a little different in timing and its a lot harder to hold up bigger combos when more variety in enemy types like venom brutes and martial arts experts.  The shock gloves feel like just evening things out at this point.\n\nThe story is probably this game's strongest part.  Without spoiling much this is Batman early in his career.  He's more stubborn and hot headed.  One of my favorite parts is Gordon and how his character progresses through the story and how he distrusts Batman and thats a really cool dynamic.  Young Barbara already got the inkling to become oracle here as well.  They do a really cool plot twist that is just as disapointing and I wont spoil it here.  I will say that Bane is the strongest part IMO.  As someone who has been waiting for a proper bane in something I am so happy with how they treated him here.  It also kinda helps explain why is the way he is in previous games.  Read the Knightfall comic storyline and see why not even Dark Knight Rises got Bane right IMO.\n\nI'm just rambling at this point.  I'm a big Batman nerd if you couldn't tell lol.\n\nAlso shout out to the awesome voice acting across the board.\n\nFinally the last thing I want to talk about is the open world.  This worked so well in City beacause it was all interesting.  It was densly packed and felt bigger than it actually was.  In this case its feels empty.   It feels like a city built around a video game instead of a video game built around the city.  Sense of scope is all scewed.  Parked cars all look like they were designed for midgets.  It doesn't look like a city at all.  It looks like a close up of a model city.  People complained about the riddler trophies in City and how many they were and how they got "annoying getting them all" but at least those were interesting to get.  In this there is literally no challenge to getting any of them.  Errr I mean Enigma data packs :/.  You come across one and 5 seconds in you either have the gadget capable of getting it or you don't and move on.  This is actually its saving grace because prepare yourself for this game's biggest let down.  There is no reason to getting these.  Some XP and a little throwback to previous games.  Catching Riddler in City had a point.  He had hostages.  He needed to be dealt with.  He was a real threat and there was more to it than just collecting ♥♥♥♥ like an old 90s platformer.....  In this he's  blackmailing criminals and Batman has to stop that because.........  thats worse than beating them up?  Ok then well the completionist in me hated this.  There was no fun in getting them and absolutely no pay off because you don't even catch him.  Save the time and ignore this part of the game and it will be much more enjoyable I promise you.\n\nSo TL:DR gameplay is almost exactly the same as Arkham City.  Story is cool.  Game map and side missions are lame and boring.  The good outweigh the bad.  If you like Batman you'll enjoy this.","September 24, 2015","true","62.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

No? Then do yourself a favor and don't start with Arkham Origins.\n\nIf you played the others and liked it then you'll likely enjoy this one as well. It is inferior in many ways though, and I'll try to make a comparison of the most pertinent aspects below.\n\nDid you enjoy the story hinted on the trailers? If so, I'm  sorry to say this but you'll be disappointed. I won't spoil the surprise (even though I find it hard to believe it's a surprise to anyone by now) but there's a very obvious twist that simply negates the whole story advertised in the trailers. After the disappointment with the story passed I actually quite enjoyed it though! there are some interesting moments and characters. Nothing fantastic but it does its job competently.  Considering this is a prequel they certainly made some strange decisions reagarding the story. We know the villains, we know Alfred never dies, we know Batman doesn't die etc. These things can't really be used as tension effectively, but they certainly tried. They should have used the opportunity to introduce some new characters and put some real tension in there, but that's my opinion.\n\nBut the true problem with this game is the obvious lack of polish. Bugs, glitches, freezes,crashes, performance drops... you name it, Arkham Origins has it. The lack of polish also shows on most of the gameplay features. A few examples: when in combat mode, the camera will be your worst enemy, showing the wall, hiding behind light posts, losing sight of batman or, when not being completely against you, just sitting the least helpful orientation possible with every enemy on the wrong side of the camera. Other example of lack of polish in gameplay is when gliding accross the city. You'll find yourself frustrated by the grapple's edge detection system. It has the habit of not detecting obvious edges you can see right in front of you, sometimes detecting edges you have no intention of grappling to etc. It's a less satisfying experience to say the least. These examples just illustrate the way the game was rushed to the shelves. It lacks polish, the kind of things solved by tweaking of parameters until everything feels right.\n\nMy last complaint is the zipline feature. This was one of the fun things in other games, all you needed was a wall behind and in front of you to zip accross it! Fun and a gameplay element that opens up so many possibilities. In this game they ditched that for a zip line you can attach to nodes that are put on the map by the level designer. It's so boring. It's essentially a door/key system in disguise. A very similar dumb move was made by Thief developers when ditching the freedom of rope arrows in favor of predetermined nodes where you can put your rope. It's just a fancy key to a door.\n\nIt's hard to find something they did better than previous games. I like the graphics a lot! but it's not exactly better, it's just different, more realistic style. But I do welcome the different approach, it looks very nice.\n\nIf we weren't comparing with previous Batmans (which admittedly is a difficult position for any game to be in) I would say the bugs are the main problem with it. Some of them are absolutely game breaking! but if you can endure that this is a great game. It has my recommendation.","March 31, 2015","true","36.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

That being said, Origins feels like a step backwards from its predecessor, Arkham City.\n\nBased during the early years of Batman’s career, the game focuses on a plot by the infamous crime lord, the Black Mask. I’m not familiar with the comics, so I was very happy to see a new primary antagonist replacing the Joker. The only problem was that Black Mask wasn’t the primary antagonist; it was surprise surprise, the Joker AGAIN. It was during the unveiling of this revelation that I became upset with Origins. I understand that he’s Batman’s arch enemy, but he had such a large role in the previous two games that I just wanted a break from his jokes. It became so much easier to compare the game to Arkham City, which was not a good idea.\n\nThe previous game, Arkham City, had a very deep and original setting. A prison city that was filled with Gotham’s worst criminals was very interesting. In contrast, Origins features a Gotham city roughly twice the size, but only half as interesting. Random criminals prowl the streets and no sign of other life can be found. I wanted cars, pedestrians, and so much more. I expected a living city.\n\nThere were parts of the game that impressed me though. I really liked the upgrade system. It’s still quite basic, but a definite step up from previous games that pretty much unlocked half of the upgrades from the get go. They added some cool new gadgets that I used quite often.\n\nAs for the bad guys, I felt they didn’t have enough screen time. One by one they showed up, you fought with them for 15 minutes, and that was the end of them. In particular, the fight against Deathstroke was one of the greatest boss battles I’ve ever played, but after beating it, he never made a return. What’s more disappointing was that his character was only available to play as in the boring and mostly generic challenge maps, rather than the actual campaign. Some of the other villains came and went without me really remembering them at all cough cough Electrocutioner. It kind of felt like Warner Brothers sold the game on the premise that there would be plenty of bad guys to go around, but delivered a mediocre performance from them. Quality is always better than quantity in my opinion.\n\nThe multiplayer is a new addition to the franchise and I don’t really know how to describe it. I feel as though the game didn’t need it and it was an attempt to get people to continue to play the game. There are times when it’s quite enjoyable, but I always felt as though it needed to be re-worked based on certain over-powered features such as the criminals detective vision.\n\nDespite the uninspiring plot twist, the often annoying multiplayer, and the incredibly familiar gameplay, the game wasn’t that bad. I wasn’t too upset, but wasn’t too impressed either. I can safely say it felt like a 6/10 experience on the whole. Worth playing if you like the Joker, not so much if you wanted more.\n","November 30, 2013","true","35.7"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","18","31","0","0"

The gameplay copies the other two titles to a T, with no originality thrown in. This is made worse since the combat in the other games flowed much better and this game generally has a small list of bugs. The story is very run of the mill, I found myself extremely disappointed as it started running over old villans for the third time now instead of using the newer villans to greater effect. The game does so little to make itself different from the others, and is so sloppy in execution that the game drags on towards the end.\n\n6/10 If you're a fan you can consider getting it on sale, but as a large fan of the past two games I honestly regret the time I spent playing this.

And since that was already good gameplay there's little more I can say about it. The story takes place when Batman is still relatively new at his work apparently, but the only real way you see it is in how other characters act towards you. Otherwise, all the skills and gadgets are there for you to use. So it all feels kind of disingenous when everyone acts like you are this new vigilante who might not actually be real, but you have the full skillset of the Batman that everyone later knows. Not exactly what this game said its Batman was like.\n\nOne highlight of sorts is the voice acting: Batman and the Joker got new VA's for this, and yet I couldn't really tell the difference. They both sound close enough to Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill that, had I not known in advance that the latter wasn't the Joker anymore, I wouldn't have forced myself to look it up to check for sure. So I guess that's something. Oh, and our new Joker is the same guy who voiced Booker Dewitt from Bioshock Infinite. I thought that was neat.\n\nI can't call this a bad game, but I wasn't really into it either.

While there are pacing problems, the overall plot is deep, thought out and even manages to surprise in a few areas.\n- Sound design and the soundtrack are superb; feeling like they had a real production value and weren't just simply overlooked. (unlike some other things)\n- The voice acting is incredible, for the most part, with Troy Baker as The Joker stealing the show. (though Roger Craig Smith as Batman does a pretty good job at emulating Kevin Conroy from previous games) I must admit it's jarring to hear Batman's voice at first, (being so used to Conroy's work) but it doesn't take long to get acclimatised, with halfway through the game, barely noticing the difference.\n- The game manages a decent length of around 10-12 hours for the main story.\n\nNow on to the negatives.\n- The game world, while being of a decent size, is too cumbersome to travel round. Most of your time in the open world will be spent travelling from A to B by grappling rooftops. The fast travel does alleviate this, but you have to unlock the various points by overtaking radio towers as side missions, making the whole thing feeling a bit like too much work.\n- Most of the side missions are now completely seperated from the main plot, they are now mostly unintresting and uninspiring filler.\n- The combat is only slightly improved from City, and with the inclusion of the new shock gloves, makes it far too easy to beat enemies.\n- Most of the little refrences and in-jokes to other DC comics which made the previous games that little bit more awesome are gone, it feels like most of the devs aren't as passionate as Rocksteady and it would have be nice for a couple of easter eggs here and there.\n- The first part of the plot (about the assassins) doesn't quite gel with the rest of the story and feels like an excuse to shoe horn some D-list DC villans.\n- The Penguin's 'assistants' are some of the worst characters I have ever seen in a Batman game. Plus the thick (what I assume is meant to be cockney) accent of one of them is so horrible, it's on par with Bolo Santosi in Just Cause 2.\n- While I haven't played much of the multiplayer and while it was fun, it lacks depth to keep my interest, making it only passable at best.\n- The biggest flaw of Arkham Origins, however, is its MOUNTAIN OF BUGS. While most of the game breaking bugs have been reportedly fixed, there are still a plethora of visual bugs, such as the skybox having circular clouds covering it, textures spazzing out and not unlocking certain areas of the game. Fortunately, in my personal experience, all it needs it a checkpoint restart. Others haven't been so lucky. As WB Montreal aren't fixing the game anymore a minority will most likely never finish the game, buy at your own risk.\n\nThis game is nowhere near worth its full asking price, and some of it is really good and well done, which only makes it more painful to say that if you have never played the Arkham games NEVER EVER PLAY THIS. If you have played the previous two then wait for a sale, only then it will be worth at least a vague look.\n\n4/10","April 26, 2014","false","16.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

The first few hours will feel very empty and pretty much dissapointing, if you have played the other 2 games of this series. The overworld feels empty, geometry detail is very simplified even with DX11 effects enabled. Overall the mood was pretty badly executed as far as the city itself goes. You will only see impressive visual and level design once you go indoors, where lights are elaborate, cinematic and colorful. Colour is much more abundant this time.\n\nThe combat system, both predator (stealth) and close up combat, remain pretty much identical to previous versions, aside from a few superficial changes like sounds. There is however a new mechanic that increases your damage output towards the second half of the story, but I don't want to spoil that for you. I found that close up combat felt more satisfying than stealth, simply because the stealth rooms were not designed for you to be creative, really. Rocksteady made extremely enjoyable stealth challenges, and WB basically was not capable of getting anywheres near that level of intricate design. All you really have to do in these sections is grapple around, wait for an enemy to seclude himself from the others, and take him down by gliding behind him and performing a silent takedown, rinse and repeat. So basically, this time close up completely trumps stealth, where as I found in City and Assylum, the stealth was more enjoyable than close up.\n\nGadgets remain from the previous games, some replaced by something similar, essentially reskinning previous ideas.\n\nThe main thing that WB really did right this time, is the storytelling, and the way you progress through the game. Arkham City's progression was fairly short, focused and let's face it, not very complex. Origins obviously tells the story of Batman's beginning, when he was considered a criminal just like the Joker, or Black Mask. Although Batman remains fairly emotionally flat, he lets out a lot of steam, and even interrogates many enemies through semi-torture, something that was rarely adressed before. Batman seems weaker in this game, he is actually a real, relatable person, in some ways. There is a sense of character progression that was completely absent in the other games.

And it both sucks and rules at the same time. The success of the prequel comes from the story aspect where WB Montreal explains how "wuvable B-Man" met around 10-12 of the Batman franchise characters! This will include Deadshot, Jim Gordon, Barbara Gordon (and her secret identity ^^), and some bosses I was really looking forward to, as seen in the trailers: Copperhead and DeathStroke!\nThe prequel nature of this title debacles in the gameplay aspect since at the start you have more twice the ♥♥♥♥ you had in the beginning of Arkham City! This includes the Grappnel Accelerator, among other useful gadgets.\nThe gameplay is the same as AC (some small tweaks and combat gadgets have been added) which is great! Now animations feel a bit more fluid but Batman feels slightly slower overall. You see, in Arkham City, you could punch a guy so fast he couldn't punch/counter. In Origins combat, while very familiar, feels harder and requires more skill from the player.\nYou should also be happy to know that the game works perfectly with mouse and keyboard and the PC port is really good!\nThe graphics are an overall improvement over Arkham City, snow effects are f*cking extraordinary: easily the best I've ever seen! Particle effects are also really fantastic and the punch sounds are beefy and powerful and you feel like a badass!\nLike said above, sound design is solid! The enemy's guns sound like guns, specially the freaking snipers which are really annoying since they take around 40% of your health per-shot! Every time you punch a guy you feel like you are going to get your whole arms through the thug's face!\nMoving to the story: It's the best of the Arkham franchise! It's well done, it has enough twists and "Holy-sh*t! Awesome!" moments to keep you pumped until the very end, which is satisfying enough (since it's a prequel, the previous 2 games follow the events of this game, so this game's ending isn't a conclusion to the batman games by any stretch of the imagination!).\nThis game also has cool enough side missions to give you a few more gameplay hours without outright boring you from the beginning! I must highlight the 2 assassin/boss side quests!\nAnother thing this game pulls off really well are the boss fights! They all feel different, varied and try to put the various gadgets you have to good use!\nOrigins is also the first Batman Arkham game to have a Multiplayer mode! Is it good? Yeah! The concept is genious and a nice variation over the standard Multiplayer modes. The are 3 teams, 2 of them are standard thugs with guns (the 3rd-person view and handling is surprisingly good! Guns also feel good, surprisingly enough!), the other team is of 2 players (where one is robin and another is batman, and they play nicely, just like in the single player (well, batman that is, you can't play as robin...but he plays exactly like batman but with a bullet shield. He plays just like Batman Arkham City (both the Robin DLC and the Harley Quinn DLC) which is nice!).\nThe Multiplayer customization is vast and extremely deep, it has packs that you get by completing stuff in the SP campaign and MP challenges and stuff like that. There are many guns and level ups in the thugs! As for Batman and Robin it's isn't as varied and deep, but that was kind of expected...\nMy biggest problem with the multiplayer is definately the matchmaking system: it's console ported and it doesn't work very well...it never does, anyways...\nYou will have lag throughout your gameplay sessions but nothing gameplay-breaking! It's perfectly servicable and compared to other bullsh*tty matchmaking games like Aliens: Colonial Marines, Arkham Origins works amazingly well!\nOverall the game seems kinda perfect, doesn't it? Yeah, almost: It's launch was a disaster (I've seen worse trainwrecks though!) and right now, it has like a bug or two very far in-between and sometimes enemies will get stuck on the terrain causing you to sometimes break your whole combo chain. But since I'm not a combo-chain junky, I didn't mind that. I was more worried about the questionable geometry overall: sometimes there are very small places where you can be and right at the side, you can't. You can't crouch and pass under a pipe when in some other, narrower places, you can, among other annoying stuff. But this is really far in-between and don't break the experience at all. I never got stuck in terrain or anything like that, which is swell! :D\nOverall, what's wrong with this game is: rare but annoyingly low res textures! Mediocre matchmaking system! Anti-climactic bossfights: (Shiva and Deadshot come to mind) and Bane's is repeated like 3 ♥♥♥♥ing times!\nNothing that stops me from recommending it at full retail price of 49,99€ or regional equivalent (I bet Australian pricing is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t so there you have it..)\n\n-It's easily a 9/10, one of my GOTY nomenees and overall I'd say it beats Arkham City in terms of gameplay, gadgets, boss fights, etc. (well, except the fact that AC was 100% fluid bug-free gameplay and it was highly detailed. Origins is more unpolished than it's predecessor, sadly...)\n\n-So that is it, my review of Origins, I think I'll do Dishonored after this, I've already been vastly asked to so a review on it.\n\nEDITED FOR TYPOS","October 25, 2013","true","27.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","5"

I've already got about 25hrs invested running on DX11 ultra settings and haven't run into the issues that many have reported. That being said, this is probably my favorite out of the Arkham trilogy due the story, characters, and refinement in combat as well as many of the other ideas that have been fully fleshed out over the past two games.

If you want innovation, you will be disappointed. If you want the same content that you've previously enjoyed, you will be satisfied.\n\nI personally fall into the second category. I could name several games whose sequels have alienated their existing fanbase by changing too much, so I won't criticise Origins for sticking with a successful formula.\n\nOrigins is almost identical to City, in terms of gameplay mechanics and mission structure. We still have the small scale open world of Gotham, which allows us to take on secondary missions against the lower profile villains in any order. We still have the story missions, which are more linear, require the use of gadgets to bypass obstacles, contain a mixture of direct and stealth combat, and finish with a boss fight against one of the more high profile villains. And we still have the mild puzzle element provided by the Riddler trophies.\n\nCombat is as fluid and tactical as always, combining attacks, counters, dodges, gadgets and takedowns, along with a variety of enemy types, some of which require specific moves to penetrate their defences. There are a few new gadgets/abilities, but nothing really revolutionary. I quite like the shock gloves though, which charge up as you hit people, and when activated will add electricity damage to Batman's punches.\n\nThe story is okay, but it suffers from the same problem that every prequel will in my eyes. I already know what happens later, so I know certain events cannot possibly happen. For example, when certain characters are in life or death situations, but I know they are alive in Asylum or City, I know they cannot possibly die in Origins, which makes those scenes lack the tension they should have. However, I did like that a few different villains were worked in, which allowed me to expand my knowledge of the Batman universe.\n\nOrigins is very good from a technical point of view. The graphics are fantastic, although maybe there's more of a wow factor for me because I played the previous two games on my Xbox 360. The level of detail in the backgrounds, such as shop signs and wall posters, really brings Gotham to life. However I did have to turn off some PhysX smoke effects to get a consistent framerate. Voice acting is pretty good. I was worried about the changes to key roles, especially losing Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill, but this wasn't a problem and their replacements did a good job.\n\nI played with a 360 pad because that's what I'm familiar with for this series, and it worked perfectly on this PC version. I didn't notice any bugs at all. Length depends on how interested you are in hunting down all the Riddler stuff, but I've gone over 20 hours and still have things to do, so value for money is great.","December 31, 2013","true","40.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","2"

Hearing the thugs reaction upon sneakily performing an inverted takedown is great. Batman feels like the night.\n\nHowever, the icing on the cake is the boss fights.

The action moves\nat a speed that is almost breakneck, and the\nstory engaging and compelling, drawing upon\nthe rich mythology of Batman, the stories\nof Year One, Man Who Laughs and\nthe Long Halloween in particular.\n\nCombat is meaty, weighty, and at times,\nbrutal. Against mobsters, ninjas, martial\nartists and mercenaries, Batman is never\nwithout an edge, but the fighting is\nbalanced, fair and the controls are tight.\n\nSeven Assassins have been contracted by\nBlack Mask to hunt down the Bat on\nChristmas Eve. Gotham's bitter winter cuts\nyou from beyond the computer screen as\nmultiple side objectives with grueling and\ncompelling puzzles put you to the test by\nsome of Batman's soon-to-be regular\nenemies and villains.\n\nSummer-Rain realizes the amount of zeal\nyou play with, along with the sickening\nsounds of combat and gunfire. "Origins?"\nShe exclaims, leaning in next to you as\nshe peers over. You exhale quickly, being\nthis close to her was unexpected. "Yeah."\n\nShe observes in silence as you play through\nthe Arkham Origins, the story unfolding\nmore and more like an actual hollywood\nfilm. When the Joker makes his appearance,\nSummer-Rain gasps and wraps her arm\naround your own, almost making you jump.\n\nShe looks at you expectantly, and both of\nyou smile at each other, before she leans\non your shoulder and continues watching.\n\n"Idiot." She mumbles. "Sorry." You reply.\n"Class starts in 10 minutes." She says\nabsent-mindedly, as you fight Bane amid\na rooftop battle, helicopters surveying the\nscene. "When we get back to class..."\nshe disengages from holding you, and you\nfeel all the more colder than a winter in\nGotham.\n\n"This never happened, loser. No one will\nknow, got it?" You don't know whether\nto smile or feel sad, as Summer-Rain looks\nat you expectantly again, hands crossed\nabove her petticoat that flares out, drawing\nyou in as it accents her curves...\n\n"-Hey! Got it?!" She stammers, looking\nmore adorable than angry. "Yeah. Got it."\nSummer-Rain perks up, and says that she'll\nwait for you outside as she needs to go\nfreshen up. As soon as Summer-Rain shuts\nthe lab door, her face becomes determined.\n\n"Leave him alone." She says, Ms. Novocaine\nright next to her, looking into the computer\nlab window. "Or what?" She whispers.\n"He longs for me... I know that much."\n\nSummer-Rain's eyes narrow viciously,\nregarding Ms. Novocaine with cruel eyes,\neyes that were once as cruel to you from\nMs. Novocaine. "He doesn't even know\nwhat happened. If he did... he'll end up\nlike Batman. Taking it out on the whole\nworld." Ms. Novocaine smiles an evil grin.\n\n"You make it seem like that's a bad thing."\nSummer-Rain is steadfast now. "It is." She\nfiercely snaps back. "He deserves better."\nMs. Novocaine flips her hair back and struts\noff, waving her hand dismissively at\nSummer-Rain. "Does he deserve you?"\n\nYou open the door to find Summer-Rain\non the verge of tears amid the empty\ncorridor, the afternoon sun streaming in\nthrough the windows. "Summer...?" You\nstart, when she spins round, burying her\nface into your chest as she holds you\nfor dear life. "Shh." You reassure her.\n"What happened? Tell me..."\n\nShe hits your chest with her fist half-\nheartedly as she demands through her\nsobs that the class will not know. You\nrepeat her request to reassure her.\n"I wanna milkshake." She says, looking\nup at you. "I want to skip class and have\na milkshake with you at the park."\n\nTaken aback, you nod and smile slightly.\n"Okay...! Milkshakes at the park it is!"\nSummer-Rain leans her head against\nyour chest. "Promise me something..."\nShe begins, a new request of hers is\nimminent, you think. "Yes, Summer?"\n\n"Don't add me... to your burden."\n\nYour eyes widen, but she holds you\ntighter now. "Those were alfred's\nwords..." Your breathing stops only\nfor a moment.\n\n"I promise, Summer." You whisper,\nholding her tenderly as you reassure her.\n"...and I promise no one will know."\n\nSummer-Rain sniffles, looking up at\nyou now, before an uneasy distance\nis suddenly re-established between\nthe two of you. As you both reach\nthe doors of the school's entrance,\nyou feel you need to say this.\n\n"Summer."\n\nShe is taken aback but how serious\nyou made it sound. "Yes?" You face\nher and offer her your hand.\n\n"Whatever you're going though,\nSummer... I will be here. For you."\nShe looks at your hand and then\nback to you, before holding your\nhand gingerly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/larry_poste/recommended/209000/","larry_poste","larry_poste","http://steamcommunity.com/id/larry_poste/","89 products in account","I am writing this review for people that have played Batman : Arkham City (AC) and wonder if they should get Batman : Arkham Origins (AO).\n\nIf you are looking to get your mind blown by a massive improvement between the two games (say new mechanics, new engine, new gameplay features, new playable characters, maybe vehicles, etc.), then you will be disappointed : AO is basically a glorified AC. It does not bring much more than AC already did. In certain area (playable character), it actually brings less.\n\nBut if you are looking to extend the AC experience, on a new town with a new campaign, then AO is definitely the game to go for and it will not disappoint you.\n\n\nLet me put some Arkham Origins in your Arkham City :\nAO is indeed "only" a second version of AC, but this is a very good second version of AC. You will get a few new gadgets, a lot of new combat perks, a new "in game integrated" achievement system (that you must fulfill to unlock a specific serie of combat perks), among other things.\n\nThere is now a system which rewards you for your performance after every encounter, with an XP multiplier : the better you do, the more XP you get. This is a very good addition in that it forces you to play well and try different things (do not lose combo, do not get hit, use different takedowns, etc.)\n\nThey made something different with the boss fights, which are sort of based on quick time events (QTE). While I'm not a fan of QTE, to say the least, it does make up for more cinematic fights and the game is quite forgiving in that if you die, you'll get to retry at the last "stage" of the boss fight you died in. The "amount" of QTE depends on the boss, so not all the fights play the same.\n\n\n"I've read everywhere that this game is GLITCHED to the bone!"\nOn that matter, my quick recap as of november 2014 :\n- the main campaign does not suffer any bug or glitch ;\n- I did not encounter any problem in the side-missions.\n\nYet, there are two things. First, the game can sometimes "bug out" when you need to interrogate a thug. The "Y" icon does not appear when you get close to him. It can be fixed by restarting the fight. Since this bug is quite rare, the fights are quite cool and the restart option quite forgiving (you respawn close), it's ok.\n\nSecond, and this one is not ok, is a glitch with the Enigma datapack. Now, this is particularly annoying because in this game, they made it way more appealing to collect the Enigma datapacks than it was in AC. In Arkham City, I did not really want to look for and solve all 400ish (!!) datapacks. Simply did not want to. In AO, the datapacks are fewer, and they have a much better integration in the game. You get to interrogate thugs which reveal the locations of a few datapacks, which then appear on your map. This is great. But at least one puzzle (extortion file 3, datapack 6) is glitched : you cannot complete it. Which defeats the purpose of collecting any of them, since you can't complete the collection in the end. Really bad.\n\nAlso, there is a grapple situation. You will not be able to move as freely as you were in AC. Many roofs will not accept your grapple, while they would have in AC. Even if you somewhat get used to it, it remains annoying during all the campaign because you always try to "grapple up" and can see many places where it "should work", but no, it will not. Mildly annoying.\n\n\nFinal impression :\nSo all in all : if you really enjoyed AC and are looking for some additionnal content, definitely grab AO. Despite its flaws, I actually had a better time in AO due to the very satisfying combat system, meaningful achievement system, map interface, decent story, good predator maps, etc. For me, it has a been a better AC.","November 19, 2014","true","33.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You have virtually the same gadgets, same fighting system, same UI, similar city, the only thing that really changed was the voice actors and storyline and for the most part, that’s totally fine if all you wanted was more batman and the DLC for arkham city just wasn't enough, and for the most part, that was me. As of writing, I haven't actually completed the game, but I feel like I got a pretty good impression as to where everything is headed. Because this is a prequel to the other arkham games, it can't really throw too much at you in terms of story as to not mess with the canon, and this kind of permeates the entire game. Everything feels like its playing it safe, and no real effort has been put in to expanding on the previous games in any light, though again, this isn't really a bad thing, it's just something that will constantly be nagging at you in the back of your head as you play.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are virtually untouched except for a few minor things relating to the upgrade path. And again, not really bad, because the previous mechanics it uses, are probably some of the best brawler mechanics in recent time. One thing I can do without though is the often clunky PC controls, half of my deaths could be attributed to the weird key presses required to dodge and preform special moves. This was a problem in the previous titles, and I feel like there really isn't anything that can be done about it, so I feel like some sort of "360 pad required" tag would be nice.\n\nThe story isn't really anything special so far, and I’m not sure whether it really will be either, since again, it can't really do a whole lot due to its prequel nature. The thing that stood out to me the most though was the replacement of two of the main characters, Batman and The Joker. In the previous arkham games, they were voiced by their cartoon counterparts. The joker epically was made by Mark Hamill, who is absent in this game. The Joker replacement isn't bad, but Batman, instead of sounding level headed yet very, what’s the word I’m looking for, stern? Now sounds like he is constantly angry and thinks half yelling makes him sound scary. It’s just something that got on my nerves slowly over time. This could have been explained by Batman not being as controlled or weathered by the years, but it’s never brought up and Batman is just as, or oddly if not more capable in this game that in the future games, it just made less sense the more I pondered it. Another thing is the city, while it seems to be bigger, it has less nooks and crannies, and is missing the hidden riddler riddles of previous games to seem "better" in any sense, and it just feels like arkham city all over again since its still all cordoned off and populated only by thugs, I don't ever recall seeing one civilian in the game outside of a few scripted cutscenes and segments. Again, this is sort of explained by there being a storm on Christmas Eve, but I really just found it odd.\n\nNow, as much as I griped, I still find the game very enjoyable, and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for more batman, or even just getting into the series, since playing them out of order probably doesn't help.\n","July 2, 2014","true","20.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Yes, it has a number of weird glitches, but up until now I have not run into anything game breaking. The combat remains pretty much the same from AC, the combos look better, the story is fine, and more detective work is interesting. The side quests are awesome, you will meet old and new adversaries, some of them you already met in the previous games (well, previous games, but in continuity, AO is a prequel). As someone who spent more than 30 hours in both AA and AC I can recommend this game mostly to fans of both games, while new players should really start with Arkham Asylum.\n\n8.5/10, would be 9 if not for the minor glitches which are annoying.\n\nEdit: There is hope for some bug fixes in the upcoming DLC Cold Cold Heart, even though they denied they are making anything. At least I find it rather stupid not to fix the common issues with bugged Enigma stuff.\nEdit n.2: After finishing the story I have to say, AO has the best story of all the Arkham games.\nEdit n.3: The DLC Cold, Cold Heart is fine. Nothing spectacular, the crash was fixed pretty fast, minor glitches still exist (weird camera angles and the weird movement of the camera).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markomkd21/recommended/209000/","markomkd21","Fuhrer Marko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markomkd21/","103 products in account","Arkham Asylum was a revolutionary game. Arkham City was as well. By contrast, Arkham Origins is viewed as an evolutionary game, and between that and the fact that the principal actors and development studio have been replaced a lot of people figured "eh, I don't need to play this for a year." Technically speaking, Arkham Origins does feature revolutionary additions over the previous games, but it's in an area that nobody particularly asked for in the first place: online competitive multiplayer. I myself have yet to even launch it, but given that it's developed by Splash Damage I'm sure it's not slapped together. They did after all make the Return to Castle Wolfenstein multiplayer (which got carried over into Enemy Territory, and then Quake Wars, etc).\n\nThe thing about the single-player is that while it's good, you literally cannot help but compare it against Arkham City the entire time. The combat system and animations are completely carried over, with some additions. You have some new gadgets (one is allegedly "new" but in reality is functionally identical to something else from Arkham City) and face a few new common foes. Luckily, one of the gadgets is straight out of Super Inframan and makes combat even more satisfying since you trounce everyone with it, and the others give you more options during the Predator encounters. The enemy AI is altered since the rate at which you counter rather than strike has gone way, way up. Boss battles are VASTLY improved over the previous games, as each one emphasizes that you do different things. At no point do you feel "well, this is the same thing I did for the last boss."\n\nBut even with that said, at most points you DO feel "well, I've done this before." Aside from the combat, the sidequests have you doing the same gameplay mechanic as 2 years ago (and 4 years ago) albeit for a different cosmetic reason. Example: in Arkham City you have to quickly travel across the city to answer phones in time to stop a killer. Here, you have to do the same to defuse bombs. It's the same map as Arkham City, albeit with some new zones. It helps a little that you can now fast travel. But there must be fewer grapple points because getting from place to place is a little trickier than it used to be.\n\nYou'll be fighting and fighting, and with the random "crimes in progress" that spawn, you'll fight more. You're rarely going to be scanning the environment unless you're prompted to do so. Crime scene investigations are a new addition, but much like the show CSI you aren't really doing anything yourself. The computer is magically reconstructing a series of events based on your having scanned a body and a spot of blood (which they can't show as red). Then you go beat up a guy. You can't inadvertently defeat the person you meant to interrogate either, so there's no "save this guy for last" aspect to combat. But you are now given grades for each encounter, such that higher grades yield XP bonuses. Winning is largely a foregone conclusion given that you're Batman, but winning with an A or S rank is the tough part. In fact, I still haven't gotten the last one because it doesn't always play the *wham* sound effect to denote you KO'ed someone with a hit (I call this the "BATMAAAAAN!" since if I could mod this game I would replace that sound with the screaming pug). The game offers various challenges for additional bonuses and upgrades, but it's buggy about deciding whether or not some of them "count." I busted my ♥♥♥ doing the "do 4 exotic takedowns in a Predator section" and then it didn't count it. And then it turned out there were no more Predator sections in the game. AND it won't let you complete those challenges on the challenge maps, so if you don't do it during the story you're screwed...unless you replay it on the much harder New Game+ mode...\n\nThe reduced architecture grapples and increased enemy attack rates are somewhat minor, but if there's a major "step backwards" here it's one of atmosphere. This Gotham City isn't yet overrun with supervillains who've marked their territory and themed their gangs. The incentive to see the world isn't really as strong. The Riddler's challenges were designed to direct you to all the cool little references, but at this point there is no "Riddler" etc so you're basically completing the challenges for the sake of hearing the "extortion data that's going to harm innocent people" recordings. Except pretty much all of them pertain to supervillains and corrupt civil servants whom you take down anyway. It feels more like a task since there's less "reward" for doing it. Why oppose this so strongly? That's the REAL enigma.\n\nThe strong negative online backlash to Arkham City's criminal dialogue means that EVERYTHING pertaining to threats or abusive language is long gone (that already got walked back since the Arkham City DLC) so pat yourselves on the back, Team Social Justice. Between that and the fact that Batman is less infallible at this stage of his career, the writing has gotten a lot more praise compared to Arkham City. But for me, it feels less satisfying to beat people up because I overheard them saying they're cold and hungry, or that they're resorting to crime because they lost their job and now they have to not be home on Christmas Eve. This definitely plays into the "Batman as fascist authoritarian conservative" reading of the character. I kind of wonder if the writers just hate Batman as a concept, since the villains all expose the flaws in his approach and morality and Batman has no answer because he can't admit "the reason I can't kill you is because you're all too profitable as IP."\n\nAlso, the game takes place over a few hours on Christmas Eve into Christmas Day, yet the amount that happens is absurd. True, a lot happened during Arkham City, but there was planning leading up to it. How can these locations be THIS devastated and re-renovated in just a few hours? And it's not even accidental; the game points out "yeah, it's been 3 hours." On the other hand, James Gordon isn't Commissioner yet, so the cops are pretty much all dirty. In this game you get to beat up SWAT team guys, which is the part of "Year One" that is the most important.\n\nThe Assassin's Creed guy as Batman has his highs and mids since he's mostly forced to imitate Kevin Conroy, but with a name like "Roger Smith" you'd think he was BORN to impersonate Kevin Conroy's Batman! Troy Baker (who already nailed his Richard Moll Two-Face impersonation in Arkham City) is about as dead-on a mimicry of Mark Hamill's Joker as one could hope, given that Mark can no longer really do that voice anymore. Richard Epcar (voice of the Joker in the fighting games) has a few background lines that jump out to me, but I guess he also directed a lot of the secondary dialogue recordings.\n\nI enjoyed Arkham Origins, but I'd still say to hold off on getting it. Not so much because of the issues described above so much as the fact that there's a ton of DLC and all of it's spread out across platforms and retailers due to exclusivity (Challenge maps where you're Bruce Wayne in training, etc). There's a Season Pass which includes that stuff, but it costs another $20 and for now is almost entirely cosmetic. They say there'll be at least one story DLC, but what'll it be about? Maybe something inspired by The Long Halloween? I don't know, so I don't know if that, a few challenge maps, and some cosmetic skins are really worth the money. For now I'd say to pick this up once a "complete edition" is available unless you happen to buy a new video card that bundles it.","May 10, 2014","true","40.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

While the story that is set on Christmas Eve is neat, the writing is sloppy, and the assassins are making a lot of dumb and contradicting decisions. Even though I played Arkham City two years ago, I can tell that some of the assets were re-used in this game. Moreover, the gameplay has not changed much, except for some additions to your equipment. So just take what made the Arkham games great, then rinse, repeat.\n\nFans of the Arkham games sooner or later will ask the following questions:\n- Why does Batman start out with all of his equipment from Arkham City at the beginning of the game?\n- Where are all the people in Arkham? I guess they are all locked inside, right...\n- Why is the writing so forced in some areas, especially with the Joker?\n\nDo not get me wrong: Arkham Origins is a very enjoyable game and there are some nice moments in it, but this whole origin story could have been dealt with much, much better.\n\nIf you played Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, you should not buy the game at full price.","January 2, 2014","false","20.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This one is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of the lot. The world is much larger than the previous game (Arkham City) which is a plus, however that being said, they recycled half of the map from Arkham City as well. The buildings are taller, so you're able to glide from point a to point b with no issues but it's kinda pointless to do so. The fast travel feels very repetitive. The Bat Cave is a neat little addition to the game. The story felt very generic, with a very forseeable twist. It has some really neat easter eggs, like towards the very end of the game you got to meet Harleen Quinzel the intern.\n\nThe Gadgets... oh my god the gadgets. You start out with the Grapnel Booster for one, secondly they're almost identical to the gadgets from Arkham City. Baterangs, Bat Claw, Explosive Gel, all of that good stuff makes a return. The Freeze Grenade was replaced with a Glue Grenade and it (not kidding) is EXACTLY the same as the Freeze Grenade. The remote claw is neat, but it's comparable to the line launcher. You can even hold a button to ride down it just like the line launcher.\n\nLastly, the Riddler (Now known as Enigma) side objective. It was a joke. What I always do is clear the game, beat all the bosses and start to go for all the thugs that work for The Riddler. After I got all the information where the riddler items are, I go out and find them all. This whole process in Arkham City took me about 40 hours to complete on top of all the other things, so probably about a combined total of 55 hours or so (not including game+). In this game, Arkham Origins, it took about 8 hours to gather all of the riddler items.\n\nAll in all, this is an okay game. However if you compared to the previous two in the series, it's terrible. If you're thinking of purchasing this game just wait til the Game of the Year edition is released, and goes below $29.99.","March 15, 2014","false","43.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game builds upon the great systems that City introduced, in my opinion Oranges offered a better story, however, this is for you to decide on your own. The multiplayer was a good edition but one I don't think the game required.

Games Montréal not rocksteady and the story is set 2 years before the story in b man arkham asylum. Okay first thing im going to talk about is the story:\nThe story is set on cristmas eve and black mask has hired 8 assassins to kill the Bat. In this game black mask will be important in the story. Batman is trying to save his head by takingdown every assassin my opinion is that the story in arkham asylum and arkham city are a lot better.\nthe second thing is gameplay:\nthe gameplay is the same as the previous games.One thing is realy good and that is the boss battles there are alot more boss battles than in the previous games and thats realy cool.\nthe third thing are the graphics and enviroment\nThe grapchics are the same as the previous games the system requiremens are the same but the problem is that the city is realy lifeles  and not well designet as arkham city so...\nThe multiplayer\nBatman arkham origins is the first batman arkham game that has multiplayer. The multiplayer is realy fun there is 3 control points that you have to capture all three. When you capture all three you eliminate the gangs reinforcments to win that is invisible predator online mode but there is hunter hunted mode that you have only one life. The rest of the multiplayer you can check on the internet its realy realy fun and you can play as bane or joker or the heroes.\nThe final verdict:\nThe final verdict for batman arkham origins is:\nstory: 7.5\ngameplay:9.4\ngraphics:7.8\nmultiplayer:10.0\nSo batman arkham origins is a good game but nothing like batman arkham asylum and arkham city. Thats what i expected when the other company developed a batman game and not rocksteady but the multiplayer rocks for me its the best multiplayer in the history of gaming, but most people would disagree. Well a new batman arkham game is coming out in october batman arkham knight and rocksteady will be developing it so i think it will be epic.","April 12, 2014","true","213.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The occasional FPS drop and unresponsive counter attack, yes. There felt to be a lot of loose ends with the main story that aren't addressed by the end of the game. Without giving too much away, there are certain villains that take a back seat as the story goes on and the game never revisits them, instead pushing the Bat towards one or two of them until you start to forget about the others. Overall, it's your basic Arkham game: smooth combat, strong storyline (except for the previously mentioned issues) and lots of bonus objectives after the completion of the story.

The combat is the same free flowing wonder from the previous games. Its nice to see the early days of Batman shown in a video game. The vigilante/criminal uncertainty feels nice. The Batman-Joker dynamic is handled really well in this game.\n\nOne area in which the game lets you down is in the inconsistent world traversal, especially with grappling. When you are gliding around Gotham, it feels as if the developers decided to put in grapple points at random. So you lose the momentum and land when you dont want to. The usual tropes in Arkham games also are present. Mash A to open grates is extremely annoying.\n\nAll said, Arkham origins tries hard to be as good as the Rocksteady games before it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SCiM/recommended/209000/","SCiM","Chosen One 41","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SCiM/","164 products in account","This was a damn great game. Comparing this game to most other games just seems unfair. The story is amazing, the graphics are amazing, the sound is amazing and it all runs and looks very good on my slightly outdated rig. Nothing was done poorly save for the fact that the game has quite a few more bugs in it than would be desirable. If you have never played a game in the Arkham series than you will very much enjoy this game, although I would personally recommend going in order of release (Asylum, City then Origins). That all being said this game is both a prequel and a fairly stand alone story so you can play it out of order if you want.\n\nNow, after all that being said let's get some context of where I think this game stands in the series by first stating what I think of the first two games. I consider Batman: Arkham Asylum to be one of the few perfect games ever made. That being said I didn't care for Arkham City all that much. I did still quite like it but I felt that Asylum did everything better. The downsides are that for one the combat feels slightly slower and easier, not by a whole lot but it is noticeable. Being that Asylum felt like it had a perfect difficulty I see this as a downside. Another is that the open world design of City felt unnecessary as you were still locked in an asylum like before but this time it essentially just had a large outdoor room connecting everything. In short it may have been technically open world but it wasn't very open and it wasn't very world either. Asylum however was spooky and claustrophobic and it just worked. Another issue with City was the story. City was all over the place in a way. In Asylum we mainly had the Joker and few other villains on the way and that was fine but with City it just couldn't keep its focus on who the main villain was. Also Asylum had one silly moment in regards to the last part of the game but City felt like it had many silly moments through out.\n\nThat all being said I would place this game just slightly under Asylum but above City. The combat is back to actually being somewhat difficult as it is sped up from City's slower combat. This kind of all goes out the window once you get a certain upgrade halfway through the game but even then I would hold Origin's combat above City's. Another thing done better is the city itself. For once in the series you actually get to be outside of an asylum's walls and actually stop crimes in progress and solve crimes and such. It actually feels like you are inside of a city which is further helped by about doubling the size of the map from City. Lastly is the story. My god, Origin's story just might be the best. We see a younger Batman who doesn't have much experience and is essentially going through his first significant night of crime fighting. There actually some character progression as opposed to Asylum or City where Batman was already experienced and is who he is. That all being said I would like to repeat as I said above, Origin's only real failing is that this game seems to be quite a bit more buggy than a game should be. I heard at launch it was even worse but even as it stands now I have enemies get stuck in walls making sections temporarily impassible. Nothing has happened that can't be fixed by reloading a checkpoint however so it doesn't detrack too much.\n\nTo sum everything up here:\nAsylum: 100/100\nCity: 95/100\nOrigins: 99/100\n\nP.S. Oh yeah, there is also a multiplayer but I never bothered to try it. It's designed by Splash Damage so chances are it's quite good but I bet no one plays it anymore.","July 1, 2015","true","89.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalo_todo/recommended/209000/","kalo_todo","FMA.VanHohenheim","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalo_todo/","755 products in account","I only slightly recommend this game for people who want to continue the game series, for others I DONT recommend it. Play the previous ones. I am a fan of the previous games and of batman but this series keeps getting worse, at least for PC.\n\n1. The Story is fine. Nothing major. Just fine. You have a lot of side quests to do if you are bored. They are pretty boring after a while because repeating the same bust over and over again seems pointless. Especially the extortion files (riddler things) are boring as they repeat themselves for every territory. No idea who thinks that kind of grinding is fun.\nSome cutscenes are skipable some are not, just telling you that its loading but it probably isnt.\nIt is a mystery to why it is not possible to listen to tapes while gliding through gotham. Worked in previous game but not here. That means you have to stay in the audio file and wait for it to play till the end. That breaks with the flow of the game.\n\n2. The graphics are good considering when it was made, the faces are mediocre though.\nThis game is out for years and there are still so many repeating bugs in there.\nFIrst bossfight against croc pretty much always glitches and croc himself is dissapearing out of the world and reappearing (flickering) and the sound cuts off at the later stages.\nIf you glide of places you sometimes have a bug where you kinda flap your wings like a bird.\nThe games sometimes even crashes if you enter a ingame cutscene, happend to me at least once, other times it just hang for a short time.\n\n3. Controls are as bad as always. You just do sometimes things you dont want to do or sometimes counters do not work even though you pressed.\nThis makes the boss fights so much more annoying. Most of them are stupid gimmick fights. The fight agains Bane just takes forever because of the controls and the limited options of how to take him down.\nThe fight against Deathstroke is probably the stupidest of all with those counters. This is barely a fight and more a game of counter. Who counters better. Considering how early you fight him this is a good spot to just stop playing if you cant defeat him in normal or high difficulty because at first you dont really get the fight after a few tries.\n\nThe world is essentially a bigger Akrham City I guess. It looks very similar of course. Thats good as you have spots that you remember.\n\n4. I have played 2 games of multiplayer. Playing as one of the thugs is horrible if you know how a shooter is supposed to be played. The camera control and controls are so ♥♥♥♥. Dont even try it, believe me.\n\n5. Cold Cold Heart is the only addon that makes sense so dont buy the season pass.\n\nI am not gonna say that this game is bad but it has a lot of issues and thats why its AVERAGE at most. After playing this game I am not surprised how broken Arkham Knight is supposed to be on PC.","January 9","true","35.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/meeshner/recommended/209000/","meeshner","Meeshner.wav","http://steamcommunity.com/id/meeshner/","177 products in account","Batman: Arkham Origins is the Prequel-Sequel to the previous 2 Arkham games. Developed and published by WB Montreal instead of Rocksteady, one might be turned off to the idea of this game and would be unwilling to give the game a try. I disagree. Here's why:\n\nArkham Origins takes place a few years before Arkham Asylum, 2 years after Bruce Wayne donned the cowl of Batman. One of the leading criminals, Black Mask, is tired of Batman ruining his plans and sends 10 elite mercenaries (some more elite than others) to kill Batman in one night, Christmas Eve, for 50 million dollars. The story mainly follows Batman evading and defeating the mercs, as well as chasing down the Black Mask. As with Arkham City, there are a few twists and turns along the way, bringing a good time to the game.\n\nThe "Origins" part of the game is very interesting, as it explores the origins of the Joker as the Red Hood (canon in the comics), if not only breifly. It also explores the stuggle Batman is having with himself and how he feels the need to protect gotham from itself and all the super-criminals.\n\nAlthough the voice actors for Batman and the Joker are not the regular that we all know and love (Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy), the replacements that WB Montreal found are absolutely a great substitute. While not the actors that made the characters what they are, the performances were far from sub-par, and should not be the factor that keeps you from playing the game. You can tell that the actors tried very hard to keep the roles what they were, in order to preserve the legacy. The actor who plays the Joker does a phenomenal job, and I did not even realize that the actor was not Mark Hamill until I heard his monologue around half-way through the game. The Batman actor is a bit more noticeable but nothing to complain about.\n\nThe map is bigger than Arkham City's, and feels as such. There are plenty of side activities to do when you are tired of (or done with) the main story. The most fun of all of these is definitely the Crime Scenes that you can come across, and pretty much "solve" murders and thefts. There are also radio towers that Enigma (The Riddler) has hacked. These can be restored through fighting through enemies and using your cryptographic sequencer. This is recommended to do as each tower you restore unlocks the district for fast travel, which signifigantly increases the speed of play.\n\nThe combat and gameplay is not very different from Arkham City or Asylum's, but this isn't a problem to me, as the combat does not need to be changed too much. There are 2 new enemies to fight, the martial arts expert, and Bane's super enforcers. While adding some diversity to the combat, it can feel repetitive at times, and I found myself avoiding combat situations and crime calls during the free roam parts of the game.\n\nOverall, this game is a great addition to the Arkham series, even if not near close to the best game in the franchise, and if you plan to play through all of the games, do not forget Arkham Origins. Though nowhere near a perfect game, I personally find it a better game than Arkham City.\n\n8.4/10","March 23","true","9.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198113590474/recommended/209000/","76561198113590474","Skallolf","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198113590474/","455 products in account","This game get's a lot of hate due to the fact that the map is largely the same as the map from Arkham City. Personally though, I enjoy this game a lot. I think that Rocksteady have upped the ante when it comes to side quests, and there is a feeling of "urgency" in completing them due to the fact that they are assassins out to kill you. I also enjoyed seeing some of the lesser known (less mainstream) villains like Copperhead and Electricutioner, though was dissapointed with the fact that there is no actual boss fight for the latter.\n\nAnother thing that I love is the addition of the Batcave as well. This is something that I have personally wanted to see in every Arkham game, and the small cave in Asylum just doesn't come close to the one here in Origins. It;s also a nice touch to add the Batwing as a form of transport (cut scene only) as it can help you rush around the map if you need to and the cut scenes look pretty awesome too.\n\nI personally like the story in Origins too, much more than the story from Arkham City too. I know a lot of people dislike the fact that the Joker plays a pivotal role (This being the third game where he is the lead villain) but in all honesty, I think it works very well. It shows you the transition from the mainstream real life mafia crime family type thugs (sionis/falcone) to the much more twisted super-criminal breed like Joker and Harley Quinn. I think it is very well done in introducing Batman's arch-nemesis and showing the depths of his deviousness.\n\nThe game engine itself is basically the same as Arkham City. A few of the skills on the utility belt wheel have swapped around, but that has happened in every Arkham game so isn't a major change really. They have added one or two new gadgets as well (usually collected from an assassin once you have beaten them) and that does make the gadgets seem fresher than before which is a good thing.\n\nThe Cold, Cold Heart DLC is also masterfully done and it introduces you to Mr Freeze and shows you why he is the way he is. It also allows you to see a part of Wayne Manor, and you see one or two new toys that Batman has in his arsenal. Anarky also plays a small part in this DLC as there was a quest that was removed from the main game at the last minute and so was added to the DLC as an extra. Personally I feel that this is the best DLC to date, and whilst it can be completed in a matter of hours, it does feel like a game in itself.\n\nI would say that this game get's far too much hate, and really doesn't deserve it. This is probably my second favourite in the series, and I would recommend this to anyone who has played any of the Arkham games and wants to see more.\n\nTry it with an open mind, I can pretty much gaurentee that you will like it.","March 24","true","55.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It improves many aspects of Arkham City. The campaign is more engaging. The narration is fluid and full of plot-twists. Some scenes are epic, really! The combat system is the same as Arkham City, perhaps a bit harder, and the upgrades are almost the same. That's a bit disappointing, but it's not a huge problem since the previous game hade already a very good gameplay. The map is double the size of AC: old gotham ( arkham city before the earthquake) and new gotham (more verticality). There are a lot of sidequests but not all of them are good... The voice acting is just great! I initially had some doubts about batman's new voice actor, but he surprised me. In my opinion he's even better than Kevin Conroy. Also Joker's voice acting is great! Then there are challenge maps as in the previous games and...the multiplayer, which I haven't tried yet due to some bugs (which they have solved now). good job wb montreal.  9/10","November 26, 2013","true","107.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Storywise this game isn't really outstanding and you can see the major plot twist coming from miles away. But the characters is what makes this game standout from the other two, especially the Joker. The Joker in this game is the most horrofying version I've met, the developers. We also get an insight in his messed up mind which kinda helps to not only portray him as a monster. Which I like, in the previous Arkham games the Joker is the main villain and only placed there to be a anarchistic lunatic who murders everyone who comes in his way.\n\nI've read some reviews saying that this game got performance issues. I for one have not experienced any other than a few small FPS drops when flying through the air which is to be expected. It's a big good looking world where it snows all the time, there is snow on the ground aswell as people even though I have been able to pretty much max this game(except enhanced shadows) on my R9 280x.\n\nThe game is overall great and is a nice addition to the Arkham series. I would recommend playing this one before Asylum even though it's the third in the series it a nice introduction to it.","December 25, 2014","true","18.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

While it is true that it's almost the same as Arkham City in terms of gameplay, Arkham City was amazing, a very good game. That being said, the game does have some things you won't find in Arkham City, some better, some worse.\nGameplay\n+ Everything is the same as Arkham City in regards to combat and stealth with a few new, but very welcome animations.\n+ Boss battles are improved greatly, with lots of different bosses to fight and ways to fight them. No 2 boss battles are the same.\n+ Several new additions of gadgets make puzzles and combat more fun and varied,\n+ New ways to achieve gadgets and upgrades aside from the upgrade tree by completing certain challenges make the game more interesting and more fun to reach 100%.\n- The fact that the gameplay is like Arkham City, however, will make fans of the series dissapointed, and it just feels like laziness on the devs' part.\n- Added "Shock Gloves" can be activated during combat to deal increased damage to enemies and basically ignore any armored enemies, shielded or taser enemies. Also makes leaderboards a bit hard to beat without using these gloves.\n- The beloved challenge mode doesn't feature any maps outside the story unlike previous Arkham games. Challenge maps are the same maps you've already played with challenges to complete.\n\nWorld\n+ The open world is double the size from Arkham City.\n+ Lots of brand names and logos etc. from the DC Universe, feels like I'm still part of Gotham and not just a city.\n+ Lots of things to do while outside the main story. You can go ahead and help the police with crimes in progress, solve casefiles, or go capture villains (all have very fun and unique capture missions).\n- World feels very dull and empty aside from a few landmarks.\n- The Pioneer bridge connecting the 2 sections of Gotham is very boring to fly through, it's too big to just glide through with your cape.\n- Half of the world is just Arkham City before it was Arkham City with a lot of reused assets. I was promised Gotham, not one half what I've already been through in the previous game.\n\nStory\n+ Story features a TON of villains from the comics.\n+ Lots of relationships forming in the story (Bats/Gordon/Oracle, Joker/Harley, Bats/Joker etc.)\n+The struggle of both the police and the criminals against Batman is very interesting.\n+ Alfred plays a very big techincal and emotional part.\n- Story itself has a pretty dumb premise, 8 assassins vs. Batman.\n- The story likes to use "Because corrupt cops." as an excuse for a lot of things.\n- Villains have very short time on screen.\n\nAudio and Video\n+ Graphics have been improved from last game, lots more detail.\n+ Art style is a LITTLE bit cartoony, fits the theme of the game and comics.\n+ Voice acting is SUPERB, especially Troy Baker voicing the Joker does an amazing job.\n- Textures get kind of blurry the closer you get to them.\n- Most sounds are reused from previous games.\n- Font is horrible. What is that, Arial? Are you kidding me? Just look at the "Critical Strike" text, looks very unproffesional.\n\nFinal Verdict   I recommend this game to anyone. It's got fun combat and stealth, and some interesting parts of the story. Fans of the Arkham series might be a bit dissapointed, as it doesn't bring a lot of new things to the table, but I, as one, appreciated seeing a lot of the relationships that I saw in previous games form.

If you own Arkham city, don't even think of buying this game. It is almost exactly a reskin of Arkham City, with a larger map and less memorable levels and boss fights. The map is a slightly modified version of the one from arkham city, with a very large bridge and a equally sized island. The story is okay, but the boss fights are absolutely terrible. Even on the easiest difficulty, I almost broke my monitor on the Deathstroke and Copperhead boss fights, which try to be like the Arkham city boss fights, but fail miserablely. All of them are 0/10 apart from the last Bane battle, which is fantastic like the Mr Freeze fight, exept you cannot hide or run ANYWHERE because of the small size of the room you are in, and Bane is charging everywhere. The combat is great as normal, but the developers could not hold themselves back from adding the Joker. Over all, this game is the same price as the Arkham city GOTY edition, but is worse. Just buy the Arkham City GOTY version. It is better, Funner and far more replayable.","December 5, 2014","false","65.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

That is where my enjoyment of the trilogy ends, however. I should mention that I played Arkham City with maximum graphical settings and benchmarked at an average of 30 FPS, so the fact that I had graphical issues and slowdown was interesting to me.\n\nWithin minutes of beginning the game I began to notice graphical issues. During the first boss-encounter with "Killer Croc" was a memorable one, since while I'm lead to believe that Croc's special abilities include making him extremely large and strong - the file negates to mention that apparently he has the ability to flicker in and out of visibility. This left Batman looking like he'd made a wrong turn on the way to ninja school and had taken up the art of mime instead.\n\nMore graphical errors started when I got into a more open world environment, as less than 5 minutes later I was treated to a display of Batman's amazing aerodynamic prowess - gliding gently through the air while symultaneously forward flipping in a fashion resembling a hamster in a washing machine. It was quite entertaining actually.\n\nI also have to report that the combat system is what you would expect from this latest generation of Batman:Arkham games - because it's copy&pasted from Batman:Arkham Asylum. From what I can see there have been no changes to the combat engine, Batmans animations or the AI of the... AI.\n\nAlmost all simple fights can be won by spamming the "punch, punch, punch, counter, punch, counter, punch, takedown" sequence and when faced with tougher opponents with knives, body armour or guns, it becomes "Punch, punch, punch, cape sweep, rapid punches, counter, cape sweep, rapid punches, counter, repeat as necessary until victory."\n\nThe aiming system is still rather ham-fisted, in that when there are multiple enemies attacking in close proximity to each other it can be very difficult to judge which of them will be struck. This is especially irritating when one of said enemies is charging their attack (when you would want to counter, if you wouldn't strike them before their blow landed) and hit his buddy instead - losing your combat multiplier in the process. In addition, a ground takedown still can't be interupted in order to counter a standing attack - maybe that's by design but it doesn't feel right to me.\n\nI'd also love to know why that "bat effect" which occurs on the last punch of every combat decides that my FPS should drop from my average 30 down to 1 or 2 for around 5 seconds? It's been like that since Arkham Asylum and it baffles me as to why it happens.\n\nThe RPG aspects also feel out of place to me, as they did in Arkham City. It really feels like the whole leveling up system is shoe-horned into the game in order to add play-time to it. Since I have yet to encounter any true "time limits" in the game, I see no reason why Batman wouldn't fly around the beginning area, beating up random thugs until he reached maximum level before going out to tackle Gothams meanest and ugliest. I was under the impression that was what his pre-game training was for, but oh well.\n\nAll in all, if you thought that Batman:Arkham City was a great game, you'll think that Batman:Arkham Origins is also a great game. But if you were, like I was, underwhelmed by the sequel to Batman:Arkham Asylum, then you will be left disappointed by this title.\n\nOh, one last note for the developers: Batman, being the superhero who refuses to kill, would not drop a thug from the top of a building, even if there were a christmas tree to potentially break his fall. It's very out of character and completely broke my immersion in the part - I was from that point onwards playing as Wayce Brune - the cheap Batman knockoff from China, whom evaded customs on the back of a banana shipment.","December 3, 2014","false","3.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

But I bet the one person on my friends list who reads these wants more. So in this Batman game you play as Batman. Big surprise there; and I was waiting so eagerly in line for this game so I could play as bloody Catwoman again. The difference is that this time you’re beating up thugs in all of Gotham city instead of just a part of it. Don’t know why because the map is the same size anyway. Obviously the people in charge of Gotham are true visionaries to double the city limits and then section it off. The character list was actually different this time though. Instead of fighting Two Face, Penguin, Bane and the Joker you will be fighting Deathstroke, Penguin, Bane and the Joker. Well I didn’t say it was a big difference. Apparently every villain is supposed to reflect something of Batman; the Joker is his opposite and Deathstroke is his equal in combat. So hell if I know what Penguin reflects. Perhaps it’s Batman’s insecurities or perhaps I’m just trying to make this segment longer. I should remember to cross out the last sentence later.\nThere are two things to do in Gotham city; king-hit pedestrians and label them as thugs or collect Riddler trophies, but let’s be honest, you won’t do the latter. You can finally traverse the Batcave; a privilege I never collected upon because there was nothing in the Batcave with the exception of clutter. Maybe there was a secret, but bugger if I could be bothered to find it. I now see this series taking the Halo methodology in the sense that the developers said Origins was going to be the final game, but now the Arkham series has been taken back by Warner Bros. who have already announced the next game. So I guess I’ll see you back here when that bolt from the blue arrives.

Here all of those elements are stripped away and you're left with the bare bones fighting parts of the game without much purpose.\n\nThe story is so thin. A bounty has been put out on Batman. Rather than just sit in his cave or spend the night as Bruce Wayne, he heads out into the city for everyone to take pot shots at him. This story is set back when Batman had only just begun apparently. This idea had real potential as we saw in the recent Batman movies but other than a brief mention of it at the beginning there's very little attention paid to this element in the game. And he has the Batwing! Which he never had in the earlier games... so he starts out his career with a freaking jet that he somehow looses later on? Comon!!\nAll the gadgets from the earlier games are also present which doesn't make any sense chronologically either.\nI've no idea where the Origins element came from but I get the feeling its just a marketing ploy.\n\nAfter ten mins of playing the game you realise you've been here before.

Stuffed full of bugs. One thing i hated about it was the increased number of cutscenes compared to previous games in the series. That and the fact that, even though the game its self runs fine for the most part, there are glitches (battling with killer crock, he dissapears and reappears with depressing frequecy) or the fact that cutscenes are jerky and out of synch. I am going to give this a big fat dont touch. Buy the first two by all means. They are good little games, which will take an average gamer about 12-15 hours to complete the story of, then a further 5 hours to complete the puzzles. The challenges are a nice touch i suppose.\n\nLong story short, it was probably great on console, but on steam it sucks prong.","October 28, 2014","false","16.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game play was very similar to Batman Arkham City.  It pretty much consisted of the same main missions and side missions as Arkham City except with different bad Superheros.  Gadgets pretty much performed the same  actions as the ones in Arkham City except these "new" ones had different names and minor tweaks (i.e. new glue gernade instead of the old ice gernade.)  The old Riddler Trophies are now Enigma data packs but they involve almost identical puzzles as to Arkham City.  I could go on about this forever but you pretty much get the point.\n\nHowever, if you are able to play the game on the ultra settings, it is a sight to behold.  I played Arkham City on PS3 but my visual expierence on my new self built computer was a lot better.  The character and city textures and shadows are amazing.  I couldn't believe how the snow on top of buildies realistically reacted to enemies and my footprints when sneeking and fighting.  Knocked down enemies leave body shaped dents in fresh snow cover and each foot print looks like real as if someone was walking through 4-6 inches of snow.  When inside buildings, debris and trash reacts realistically to the enemies that walk through it like ive never seen in a video game.  The texture details really made the game a more enjoyable than the similar one I played on the consul.\n\nHowever, stunning graphics and texture detials comes the need for a powerful unit to process them.  I do not know the exact specificaitons of the game but I tried playing the game on the lowest settings on my middle market laptop and it absolutely sucked.  Now I know that only specific laptops are made for gaming and mine was not made for it but even dumbing down the graphics and reslolution to its minimum wouldnt even get me past the first character interaction.  I then decided to play it on the computer i just built (Intel I5-4430 Quad core, 8GB DDR3 RAM, Sapphire Radeon R9 280 3GB GDDR5 Grahpics Card) and it was able to process everything just find on all Ultra settings.\n\nAll in all I would not reccomend this game if you previously played Batman Arkham City.  The story lines between the two games are almost identical along with the gadgets and side missions.  Even though the Ultra graphics settings and the texture detials are quite impressive, it is not worth picking up unless you know 100% that you have the hardware required to play the game on Ultra.  Also, I would not buy this game at all for its original price, the only way I would MAYBE get this game was if it goes on sale for very cheap.\n\nGo ♥♥♥♥ yourselves,\n\nCory","October 28, 2014","false","25.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Personally, I feel that the storyline presented in this iteration of the Batman: Arkham franchise is one of their most unique and intriguing yet. It has shown a much more human side to The Dark Knight than has been seen since the end of Akrham City. Throughout the games, we simply know he is the Batman but here where learn WHY he is the Batman.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegreatredwire/recommended/209000/","thegreatredwire","Redwire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegreatredwire/","62 products in account","First and foremost, this is decidedly not the first two.  Don't expect an improvement on City here, save perhaps the multiplayer.  That in mind, as a game on its own... It's not at all bad.\n\nPros:\n\nIt's a Batman game at heart:  There's a story that draws you in, combat is seamless, and there's an insanely good cast of villains and side characters alike.  The setting creates a good amount of immersion.\nGameplay here is great.  You swing, glide, and parkour through Gotham, again making every little journey fun, and not the least bit boring.  Combat's a mixed bag, with bosses not altogether unique, but each different arrangement and setting of goons you encounter make these battles the star of the game.  Gadgets are improved upon, and the new electrical gloves are fun as ****.\nMultiplayer.  So many people knock this off, due to mechanical issues, but I easily enjoyed this part of the game more than the campaign, even.  With possibly the best and most mature online community out there, a brilliant concept for battle, with three teams facing off, and a nicely balanced armory that still feels customized depending on your gang, I easily looked over the glitches and connection instability to pour 30+ hours into this mode alone.\nWhile the sound pales in comparison to Mark Hamill and city, the music and voice acting is extremely good.  You'll leave the game still feeling like Batman, the theme in your ears.Cons:\nWell, it's very glitchy.  Some enemies sink into stairs, and a good deal of goons seem to be entirely blind.  The brick-throwing is completely broken, but hilarious.  (ran this on a 660, btw)  Few of the glitches I encountered are game-breaking, but it's very jarring to be this into a game, and suddenly see five goons walking into a wall simultaneously.  I spent much of the story bending over in laughter, and another good portion wrinkling my brow in frustration.  The latter came mainly when gliding, due to the.. err.. flapping error.  Basically, Batman has a sky seizure every three times you try to fly somewhere.  This happens often in multiplayer too, and is an even bigger annoyance there, as stealth is quickly ruined by wildly flapping wings far too often.\nMultiplayer has some terrible key bindings that you can't change... The same button is used for silent takedowns and vision scrambling, which blurs your victim's screen, letting them know you're right behind them.  As you can guess, this is beyond frustrating, given that only a few inches determines which of these is triggered by your click.\nThe story and script are a little more ham-fisted than city or asylum, and there are a few groaner lines.\nThe map introduces fast travel... something no one asked for in these incredibly fun to traverse games, and expects the player to use them all the time.  This, for me, ruined much of the open-world feel I loved in the first games.\nThis is a prequel, meaning chronological synchroniation with the other two is key... This is perfect in all cases save one:  remember the "prototype" grappler you get in city?  Yeah, aparently, Batman had the same thing ten years earlier, and just forgot about it.  Nice one, Alfred.\n*finds gadget in cellar\n"Oh, Master Bruce, I.. er... finished that new gadget you requested."\n"Isn't this-"\n"No, no, this one's totally new, I swear."\nSo, all in all, it's a fairly good game with a few design and graphical challenges.  If you can't stand the issues, wait for Knight.  Otherwise, grab this one, fufill your bat craving before February 2015, and look for me on multiplayer! :)","November 18, 2014","true","113.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Music and voice actors are still awesome; Troy Baker successfully follows in Mark Hamill's steps.\nThe character models are even better than in the previous games (I needed to get used to Joker though.) and you get an average multiplayer mode that is enjoyable for some time.\n\nThere is only one reason why I can't recommend the game, though. It is buggy as hell. The worst bug is a problem many gamers had with this game: At the finale the game stops recognizing the input from your mouse and keyboard. So if you want to beat the game you need to use a controller. And if you don't have one: tough luck.

But I bet the one person on my friends list who reads these wants more. So in this Batman game you play as Batman. Big surprise there; and I was waiting so eagerly in line for this game so I could play as bloody Catwoman again. The difference is that this time you’re beating up thugs in all of Gotham city instead of just a part of it. Don’t know why because the map is the same size anyway. Obviously the people in charge of Gotham are true visionaries to double the city limits and then section it off. The character list was actually different this time though. Instead of fighting Two Face, Penguin, Bane and the Joker you will be fighting Deathstroke, Penguin, Bane and the Joker. Well I didn’t say it was a big difference. Apparently every villain is supposed to reflect something of Batman; the Joker is his opposite and Deathstroke is his equal in combat. So hell if I know what Penguin reflects. Perhaps it’s Batman’s insecurities or perhaps I’m just trying to make this segment longer. I should remember to cross out the last sentence later.\nThere are two things to do in Gotham city; king-hit pedestrians and label them as thugs or collect Riddler trophies, but let’s be honest, you won’t do the latter. You can finally traverse the Batcave; a privilege I never collected upon because there was nothing in the Batcave with the exception of clutter. Maybe there was a secret, but bugger if I could be bothered to find it. I now see this series taking the Halo methodology in the sense that the developers said Origins was going to be the final game, but now the Arkham series has been taken back by Warner Bros. who have already announced the next game. So I guess I’ll see you back here when that bolt from the blue arrives.

Here all of those elements are stripped away and you're left with the bare bones fighting parts of the game without much purpose.\n\nThe story is so thin. A bounty has been put out on Batman. Rather than just sit in his cave or spend the night as Bruce Wayne, he heads out into the city for everyone to take pot shots at him. This story is set back when Batman had only just begun apparently. This idea had real potential as we saw in the recent Batman movies but other than a brief mention of it at the beginning there's very little attention paid to this element in the game. And he has the Batwing! Which he never had in the earlier games... so he starts out his career with a freaking jet that he somehow looses later on? Comon!!\nAll the gadgets from the earlier games are also present which doesn't make any sense chronologically either.\nI've no idea where the Origins element came from but I get the feeling its just a marketing ploy.\n\nAfter ten mins of playing the game you realise you've been here before. City didn't feel like it was just more of the same. It expanded on both the gameplay and story of Asylum's more focussed efforts.

Here all of those elements are stripped away and you're left with the bare bones fighting parts of the game without much purpose.\n\nThe story is so thin. A bounty has been put out on Batman. Rather than just sit in his cave or spend the night as Bruce Wayne, he heads out into the city for everyone to take pot shots at him. This story is set back when Batman had only just begun apparently. This idea had real potential as we saw in the recent Batman movies but other than a brief mention of it at the beginning there's very little attention paid to this element in the game. And he has the Batwing! Which he never had in the earlier games... so he starts out his career with a freaking jet that he somehow looses later on? Comon!!\nAll the gadgets from the earlier games are also present which doesn't make any sense chronologically either.\nI've no idea where the Origins element came from but I get the feeling its just a marketing ploy.\n\nAfter ten mins of playing the game you realise you've been here before.

Stuffed full of bugs. One thing i hated about it was the increased number of cutscenes compared to previous games in the series. That and the fact that, even though the game its self runs fine for the most part, there are glitches (battling with killer crock, he dissapears and reappears with depressing frequecy) or the fact that cutscenes are jerky and out of synch. I am going to give this a big fat dont touch. Buy the first two by all means. They are good little games, which will take an average gamer about 12-15 hours to complete the story of, then a further 5 hours to complete the puzzles.

The game play was very similar to Batman Arkham City.  It pretty much consisted of the same main missions and side missions as Arkham City except with different bad Superheros.  Gadgets pretty much performed the same  actions as the ones in Arkham City except these "new" ones had different names and minor tweaks (i.e. new glue gernade instead of the old ice gernade.)  The old Riddler Trophies are now Enigma data packs but they involve almost identical puzzles as to Arkham City.  I could go on about this forever but you pretty much get the point.\n\nHowever, if you are able to play the game on the ultra settings, it is a sight to behold.  I played Arkham City on PS3 but my visual expierence on my new self built computer was a lot better.  The character and city textures and shadows are amazing.  I couldn't believe how the snow on top of buildies realistically reacted to enemies and my footprints when sneeking and fighting.  Knocked down enemies leave body shaped dents in fresh snow cover and each foot print looks like real as if someone was walking through 4-6 inches of snow.  When inside buildings, debris and trash reacts realistically to the enemies that walk through it like ive never seen in a video game.  The texture details really made the game a more enjoyable than the similar one I played on the consul.\n\nHowever, stunning graphics and texture detials comes the need for a powerful unit to process them.  I do not know the exact specificaitons of the game but I tried playing the game on the lowest settings on my middle market laptop and it absolutely sucked.  Now I know that only specific laptops are made for gaming and mine was not made for it but even dumbing down the graphics and reslolution to its minimum wouldnt even get me past the first character interaction.  I then decided to play it on the computer i just built (Intel I5-4430 Quad core, 8GB DDR3 RAM, Sapphire Radeon R9 280 3GB GDDR5 Grahpics Card) and it was able to process everything just find on all Ultra settings.\n\nAll in all I would not reccomend this game if you previously played Batman Arkham City.  The story lines between the two games are almost identical along with the gadgets and side missions.  Even though the Ultra graphics settings and the texture detials are quite impressive, it is not worth picking up unless you know 100% that you have the hardware required to play the game on Ultra.  Also, I would not buy this game at all for its original price, the only way I would MAYBE get this game was if it goes on sale for very cheap.\n\nGo ♥♥♥♥ yourselves,\n\nCory","October 28, 2014","false","25.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While the first two game were quite silly, they were still fun.This one doesn't feel fun, the side-quests quests feel more like chores and the main quests are uninspired and repetitions of the earlier games that add very little to the series. Graphically the game feels like it was made BEFORE the others. The levels lack detail and look primitive. A very big step backwards from CITY which had amazimg detail and still looks great. Origins feels like I'm playing a fan-made mod for CITY. The game is BUGGY and glitchy. Stupid little bugs that didn't exist in any of the previous games. Batman sometimes has real trouble figuring out if he's gliding or falling and other times whether he's grabbing a ledge or falling past it. So even the engine is a step backwards. Lastly the storyline....this game does not feel like an "origin" story. I think whoever decide to go with "origin" was not connected to the rest of the development team. Batman is already well kitted out at the start of the game and there is little-to-no development into how he becomes later Batman. Character-wise and technology-wise he already is (Grapnel-Boost?). It seems the "origin" aspect was just a clumsy way to bring back characters that had already died in the previous games.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I haven't finished the game, but the way it going I don't know if I will.","July 8, 2014","false","19.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegreatredwire/recommended/209000/","thegreatredwire","Redwire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegreatredwire/","62 products in account","First and foremost, this is decidedly not the first two.  Don't expect an improvement on City here, save perhaps the multiplayer.  That in mind, as a game on its own... It's not at all bad.\n\nPros:\n\nIt's a Batman game at heart:  There's a story that draws you in, combat is seamless, and there's an insanely good cast of villains and side characters alike.  The setting creates a good amount of immersion.\nGameplay here is great.  You swing, glide, and parkour through Gotham, again making every little journey fun, and not the least bit boring.  Combat's a mixed bag, with bosses not altogether unique, but each different arrangement and setting of goons you encounter make these battles the star of the game.  Gadgets are improved upon, and the new electrical gloves are fun as ****.\nMultiplayer.  So many people knock this off, due to mechanical issues, but I easily enjoyed this part of the game more than the campaign, even.  With possibly the best and most mature online community out there, a brilliant concept for battle, with three teams facing off, and a nicely balanced armory that still feels customized depending on your gang, I easily looked over the glitches and connection instability to pour 30+ hours into this mode alone.\nWhile the sound pales in comparison to Mark Hamill and city, the music and voice acting is extremely good.  You'll leave the game still feeling like Batman, the theme in your ears.Cons:\nWell, it's very glitchy.  Some enemies sink into stairs, and a good deal of goons seem to be entirely blind.  The brick-throwing is completely broken, but hilarious.  (ran this on a 660, btw)  Few of the glitches I encountered are game-breaking, but it's very jarring to be this into a game, and suddenly see five goons walking into a wall simultaneously.  I spent much of the story bending over in laughter, and another good portion wrinkling my brow in frustration.  The latter came mainly when gliding, due to the.. err.. flapping error.  Basically, Batman has a sky seizure every three times you try to fly somewhere.  This happens often in multiplayer too, and is an even bigger annoyance there, as stealth is quickly ruined by wildly flapping wings far too often.\nMultiplayer has some terrible key bindings that you can't change... The same button is used for silent takedowns and vision scrambling, which blurs your victim's screen, letting them know you're right behind them.  As you can guess, this is beyond frustrating, given that only a few inches determines which of these is triggered by your click.\nThe story and script are a little more ham-fisted than city or asylum, and there are a few groaner lines.\nThe map introduces fast travel... something no one asked for in these incredibly fun to traverse games, and expects the player to use them all the time.  This, for me, ruined much of the open-world feel I loved in the first games.\nThis is a prequel, meaning chronological synchroniation with the other two is key... This is perfect in all cases save one:  remember the "prototype" grappler you get in city?  Yeah, aparently, Batman had the same thing ten years earlier, and just forgot about it.  Nice one, Alfred.\n*finds gadget in cellar\n"Oh, Master Bruce, I.. er... finished that new gadget you requested."\n"Isn't this-"\n"No, no, this one's totally new, I swear."\nSo, all in all, it's a fairly good game with a few design and graphical challenges.  If you can't stand the issues, wait for Knight.  Otherwise, grab this one, fufill your bat craving before February 2015, and look for me on multiplayer! :)","November 18, 2014","true","113.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Rocksteady didn't work on this, the developer of the previous two Arkham titles, so I was afraid they'd mess up the formula or it would just flat out be a cash in with no effort. I was wrong.\n\nWhile the boss fights don't match up to the awesome of some of the Arkham City ones(Mr. Freeze in particular), they are without a doubt all animated beautifully. The fight with Deathstroke was fun as hell and looked flat out awesome considering how much of a slugfest it was. You both just go back and forth with counters and attacks, with Deathstroke going through his entire arsenal of weaponry. It's ♥♥♥♥ing badass. Tons of side questions/missions, superb voice acting(Troy Baker blows me away with his Joker. He seriously captured Mark Hamill's voice well), and loads of little small improvements/additions to already excellently executed combat mechanics. Some new animations, some old ones smoothed out, and new enemies to fight: Martial Artists hit you with combo attacks requiring either precise counters one after the other, or multiple counters in one of their attacks. It's cool.\n\nI was also fearful of the MP portion being tacked on, and while it kind of is, it isn't too bad. Very fun, I can definitely see an increased enjoyment if you were to play with buddies.\n\nIt's no Arkham City, but it's definitely better than Asylum for sure when weighing them all together.","October 28, 2013","true","59.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And thankfulIy this game has everything it's previous Arkham games had. The "Hero moment".\n\nTo my surprise it's pretty much Arkam city, however, a tad bigger. I mean why wouldn't it be right? Previously "Arkham City" had everything except for the feel of an actual city. Rather than just another large prison which was half of the city of gothem itself.\n\nArkahm Origins,\nThe story is pertty stirght forward you are the batman. A myth amongs the good people living in gothem. As well as to the scumbages, and the hardend crminals. You are either a story that's good enough to just pass the time. Or you a force to be reckoned with. To the officals and press, you are nothing more than a deranged person in a costume playing vigalante. To them you are needed to be put down.\nOn the dawn of chrismas eve a bounty was placed on his head. 50 million dollars in cash, to whomever can kills  this supposedly the Dark protector. Moments later, the worlds deadlyest assassin's come out of the shadows, to come and collect there reward.\n\nCold cold heart,\nA dlc for Arkam origins that tells the story of Victor fres aka "Mr, Freez". Here we would know, how or why did he became the iconic vilian as we all know him to this day. Did he turn out this way becuase of the lush for fortune, fame and power. Or was there a more to his stroy? Let's find out.\n\nThe combat is solid. Just as it's pervious Arkham games. A stedy beatem up. From the well timed counter attacks to utalizing every single technological, and physical tool at your disposal. Scaring the living daylight out of cold hearted criminals.\n\nOn the plus side they got to introduce a few new bad guys to beat up. As well as a few new upgrades. Some of which are just referbished items the older ones. But still interseting. Also you get to have new fast travling system the bat plaine.\n\nWhich makes this game an interesting begining to the epic story of the caped crusader.\nI was one of the lucky few that didn't get to see the deadly bugs that cuased such a headache from launch day. That just ruined the game's overall experience for so many. And I am glad that they even worked harder to fix if. So that gives them a few points in my book.\n\nOverall, it's a good game to experiance the: "I am Batman!!!" moment . Which makes this still worthy of it's name "Arkham".","December 16, 2013","true","29.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Aside from the main story, Batman can help the police deal with crimes, and confront other supervillains terrorizing the city. Arkham Origins introduces the ability for Batman to virtually recreate crimes, allowing him to investigate the scene and identify the culprit. The game is the first in the series with multiplayer capability.\n\n\n(+)Graphics : Graphics have been improved comparing to Arkham City . The game looks even more realistic now .\n\n(+)Music :  The melodies don't try to go too far and are consistently coated in adrenaline-pumping elements. You're gonna love it .\n\n(+)Cutscenes :  Absolutely FANTASTIC. Can't really tell much witout spoiling everything but cutscenes just wants to make you play more and more !\n\n(+)Story :  Arkham origins' main storyline is set five years before that of 2009's Batman: Arkham Asylum and follows a younger, less-refined Batman. So you have the oppurtunity to witness Batman become a legend from a simple .. rumour .\n\n(+)Content :  The content is wide and full of possibilities . You can either keep on following the main storyline , or go after the most wanted targets , glide around the city and help cops in need , or you can just simply run around and deal with the Riddler's crazy puzzles .\n\n(-)PVP :  Completely unnecessary . When i first heard about Origins multiplayer option i was very excited , but after actually having a chance to test it out myself i found out that it's nothing like the Singleplayer . In singleplayer you can bash in through your enemies and knock them out witout breaking a sweat . But in multiplayer , batman fights like he is drunk . Not recommended if you're buying for the multiplayer .\n\n(+)Gameplay :  The gameplay is pretty much like any other Arkham games . Same tools , same counter design , a bunch of different takedowns , but still not boring .\n\n\nMy opinion on this game is that it's definitely worth every dollar . If you liked the other Arkham games you'll probably get hooked up on this too .\n\n8/10 -   Triskelion Turbella Reviews","November 14, 2014","true","88.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This isn’t necessarily bad, however, Call of Doge received a score of 8.8, which irritates me endlessly.\nThis isn’t the best of the series, but it still is a lot of fun. The plot is a major improvement to Arkham City’s and the cinematic cut scenes are excellent. I’m not sure why people are upset about The Joker being the main antagonist. This is a PREQUEL! Of course he’s going to be the main baddy because this is technically the first time we are introduced to him! This doesn’t take place right after city, folks; this is before Asylum and the plot clearly indicates that.\nThe free-flow combat is still beautiful, but could have been improved more such as adding more combat moves. IGN deducted points because there’s ‘too many win buttons’, someone please explain that to me. WHY is that a bad thing?\nThe environment of this game is okay, but is not as lively as City; of course because of the thick snow. IGN also says there isn’t enough Easter Eggs… I’m not sure what game they played. Enigma has his challenges all over the map. IGN also said the city was ‘lifeless’. Again, not sure what game the played. You run into crimes in progresses and baddies roam around the streets.\n\nIGN was completely unfair reviewing this game. They complain about it not having many changes compared to it predecessor, but YET they gave CoD of Doge an 8.8… Clearly IGN is being paid off here, either that or they got someone who is a big CoD fan to review the game. At least the community votes reveal the truth, as the community gave Origins an 8.9 and CoD of Doge a 3.2.\n","December 28, 2013","true","18.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Music and voice actors are still awesome; Troy Baker successfully follows in Mark Hamill's steps.\nThe character models are even better than in the previous games (I needed to get used to Joker though.) and you get an average multiplayer mode that is enjoyable for some time.\n\nThere is only one reason why I can't recommend the game, though. It is buggy as hell. The worst bug is a problem many gamers had with this game: At the finale the game stops recognizing the input from your mouse and keyboard. So if you want to beat the game you need to use a controller. And if you don't have one: tough luck.

While yes, it is pretty much Arkham City Remastered, it has next to nothing new to offer. Why is that? Firstly, this game was developed not by Rocksteady (who made the first 2 games)  but by eidos Montreal. Let's start with the setting: It takes place in the Christmas-crazed  part of Gotham City that later will be made into Arkham City.\n\nAnd while Arkham City had a very dark, intense atmosphere, the first negative point in Origins is obvious: It's a prequel, which means it doesnt continue the story of Arkham City (that I'm not going to spoil for you, but let me tell you that everybody was like OMG). Also, 50% of Arkham Origins' world is Arkham City. Okay, with a few, very unnoticable changes. The graphics arent even that better. On a sidenote: Batman has pretty much all the gadgets he needed to unlock in Arkham City. But it takes place before. In Arkham Asylum, he has way less gadgets than that. But it's never explained!\n\nThe story of Origins goes like this: A new, unknown villain appears in Gotham, he murders Black Mask (the former crime boss) and takes over. Batman has to find out who that is, while 8 different bountyhunters are hired to kill him. Beating up bad guys works exactly like in Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, which isnt a bad thing, because the freeflowing is, in my opinion, the best fighting system for an action-adventure there is. The stealth missions are also well made, but seriously they are the same youll find in the previous games. Arkham Origins is definitly not a bad game, its pretty good actually, but it simply isnt a worthy successor to Arkham City. So I can't really not recommend it, because its not a bad game, But not better than the second one in the Batman: Arkham-Franchise. Buy this if you already played the first 2 games, dont buy it if youre just starting to get into the series (in that case, just go with Arkham City).\n\n\n\n\nbye","January 21, 2014","true","159.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

As for the purchase, got this for $10 off of humble bundle and bought the dlcs through steam.\n\nI do not suggest this game due to several issues and qualms I had right off the bat (no pun intended), and after a few hours, I stand by my suggestion. The game is poorly ported over, as several major aspects of PC play are completely disregarded and difficult. I personally play on a wide screen monitor, so the fact this game has no ingame FOV or graphical setting to adjust quality to my choosing is deplorable. Furthermore, if you have dual or more monitors running, the game essentially overrides any resolution on these extra monitors despite resolution limitation (i.e. the rest of your screens will be blacked out, kind of pointless dont you think?). The initial graphical settings just consist of Normal and High, not much customization there. Additionally, for those playing on high res monitors, mouse smoothing and the sensitivity options make it extrememly difficult to play as you must manually adjust them through the ini files. This comes to my next problem, as adjusting any of these ini files shoot up the ctd and glitch frequencies beyond the normal buggy gameplay.\n\nOf course, I have played the previous games as well, and can shed light on the experience to the plot and mechanics. The mechanics have relatively stayed the same, but imo, have been simplified right off the bat. The executions are far more limited than in previous games and I think the responsiveness of the movement suffers as a result of the above optimization issues. That being said, its pretty much the same thing as the previous game. Some new gadgets and detective methods have been added, but the balancing efforts disrupted much of the combat. I still say play the first two over this one as they were much better imo.\n\nWith the lack of optimization and subpar experience, save yourself the trouble and dont buy this, but if you must persist, get it during a sale. The skins are unavailable during the initial playthrough which is again a bummer as most of the dlc consists of skin packs, and replay is not an experience I wished to partake in.

Although I must say that Batman AO is inferior compared to its predecessors gameplay-wise but still pretty good story-wise. I recommend you to play Batman AO if you are a fan of the Batman Arkham series, and I FULLY recommend you to get the Cold - Cold Heart DLC since its got a really good and interesting story, as well as the bad*** new suit  THE XE SUIT ,\n\nTL,DR; I still quite enjoyed playing Batman AO, but I don't feel the solid gameplay that I got when I played the previous installments.\n\nPros:\n+ GOOD gameplay, but somehow I felt that AO has an awkward feel and controls compared to its predecessor.\n+ GOOD story.\n+ GOOD fighting system. Free Flow Combat with this new feature ( Shock Gloves ) is a huge fun.\n+ GOOD array of gadgets, allowing you to takedown enemies with your own style.\n+ GOOD sound.\n+ GOOD atmosphere.\n+ GOOD graphics, better than the previous games.\n+ GREAT characters and voice acting, the characters really felt like they are coming right out of the comics.\n+ Detective Mode Case Reconstruction is a fun new feature, but could be done better.\n+ Dark Knight System is a good addition as well, but is implemented poorly, especially the Predator System.\n+ Batwing drop system, allowing us to Fast Travel to certain points in Gotham City.\n\nCons:\n- The controls feel a bit awkward and clunky.\n- Most areas are just copied from Batman Arkham City maps.\n- More collectibles, but less Riddles.\n- Gotham City is a huge city, but the lack of any civilians feels weird to me. All I see are thugs. Is this Gotham City? or Arkham City, where all its inhabitants are criminals?\n- Dark Knight System Challenges should be able to be done in ANY ORDER, to avoid any missable challenge(s).\n- Missable predator challenge, because some of them can only be done in certain maps of the STORY mode. This is seriously annoying, especially because this game uses autosave system. Imagine if you forgot to do a 1 predator challenge, progress through the story, autosaving and BAM you just missed the opportunity because its the only area where you can do the challenge.\n- Less polished, Batman AO still has many bugs, such as:\n-> gliding achievement sometimes not triggered, it takes a few tries.\n-> sometimes after the Riddler Informant was interrogated, NO new collectibles are marked on the map, and then you must run around to find ANOTHER Riddler Informant.\n-> sometimes predator challenges are not counted when the conditions are met, but sometimes counted when the conditions are not met. I know, I am confused as well...\n\n\nOverall: 80/100\n","October 1, 2015","true","53.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I constantly found myself just doing the side missions because they were fun and interesting. All up this game is a good one, they didnt change too much but what they did change improved on City.

Batman: Arkham Origins feels like a game from the Arkham Franchise. But also, it feels completely different.. The story, the music, the sounds, the gameplay, everything seems to be completely different in comparison with Batman: Arkham City, Batman; Arkham Asylum and Batman; Arkham Knight, but at the same time, you can feel that it belongs to them, on the one or other wise. It is indeed not as good as the other parts, but it deserves to be called "Arkham" nevertheless. If you should buy it? Definetely, if you already have the other games of the Arkham Franchise and like them. But if you dont know the others, i would advise to buy another Batman game, like my all-time favourites Batman: Arkham City and Batman: Arkham Knight.","July 1, 2015","true","50.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Plus even though it features Gotham City, this city is just as dead as Arkham City (where this made a lot more sense!). So after all Arkham Origins doesn't add anything new to this amazing series and the gameplay IMO isn't as much fun.

Make him suffer, and I'll double it!\n\nWell it seems it is finally time to join the cape crusader on a deep and dark adventure on the mean streets of Gotham.\nOrigins unlike what you may think is not an origin story at all not an origin of batman or Gotham, however it shows the story of a much more inexperienced batman, and of course a earlier Gotham, one that does not yet know of the Bat and even think of him as an urban legend the kind they don't know whether he is a demon or multiple people. Batman is much more young and reckless in this game and even way more brutal in his approach this is easy to see with the amount of brutal takedowns and interrogations where batman will usually stamp on the face of his victim and with an almighty crack it's time for bed.\nThis story gets you to see as batman comes face to face with many of his most advocate foes for the very first time, including the like of Deathstroke, Shiva, Bane, deadshot, and of course The Joker.\nThe story is based around Black Mask putting a $50 million bounty on the bats head, of which 9 infamous assassins gladly accept, this is as much of the story as I will spoil.\nOne gripe i had with the story was length and execution the story and characters were good however i feel the story later on was rushed and only took me around 10 hours to complete, where as city took me almost 25, there are however more side quests afterwards.\nYou also once again have "riddles" in the form of data packs and other challenges imposed by the young Riddler himself currently going by the alias Enigma and abbreviation of Edward Nigma, he shuts down the entire network and you must solve his challenges and "riddles" to functionally use your batwing for fast travel of which is needed this time around with the vast and fully expanded Gotham.\nYou also have to collect his data packs to stop him leaking confidential information of which could be the fall of societal Gotham.\n\nStory- 8\nThe snowy streets of Gotham are absolutely stunning and even better looking than the predecessor city, with PHYSX and dx11 it takes your breath away (without the power hog that city’s dx11 did), it really is a sight to see, you can see as batman’s cape flutters in the cold misty wind, and also the cold smoke come from batman’s mouth from the ice cold temperatures, truly spectacular.\nNVIDIA this time around were first to get their hands on the title and optimize it and squeeze it for all its elemental glory, as musky smoke fills up the room as you take each individual goon down, and seeing batman determined foot prints leave its stain in the blood stained snow, it really emerges you in to the game, and truly makes you believe this is exactly how Gotham was supposed to look.\nThese graphics do not however come without its problems, i am running on SLI GTX 680's and did get some significant drop down indoors, I have heard a lot of people having problems with frame drop, however this will be patched and optimized in the coming weeks by DC and NVIDIA and AMD with patches and drivers.\n\nGraphics- 9\nArkhams well known and beloved free flow combat is something the fans were worried about with the new title, and hoped the WB would keep it the same, well I can say that they did to a T, however even refined it and sped up the combat to make it feel way more satisfying to counter mid combat and kick a guy in the chin, however this time around there are also new additions to the combat including a later unlocked electro gloves which allow batman to brutalize his opponents and punch through guarded and riot squads defense with ease of which is super satisfying.\nThey have also added in a few new enemies for you to battle this time around apart from the old brutes, titan thugs and armored thugs there are now martial artists of which have the ability to counter your counters, of which not only mix up combat but make it really satisfying to win a game of counter chess.\nApart from this the combat is basically the same free flow, counter and gadget annihilation that batman man is infamous amongst goons for, there are however a good variety of boss fights which embody lots of new tactics and ways to win, which include fighting Deathstroke of which is the perfect split between player choice and cut scene to play at 100 MPH and still feel as you are in control, and such fights as Shiva or copperhead which face you against ninjas and those who remember city the league of assassins!.\nThe combat this time around feels faster, more responsive and way more fleshed out but not without the expense of being harder to execute, however feels way more satisfying when you pull of the x50 combos!.\n\nCombat- 10\nI welcome this title as a great new installment to the trilogy and would urge any fans of the prequels or batman to make the purchase. The story is perhaps not as great as the first two but is certainly worth the ride, especially with Troy Baker as The Joker, the combat is even improved from the last two. There is plenty to do here I have clocked in almost 23 hours and still have plenty to do including multiplayer, combat maps and new game plus, tings to unlock and discover!\nBatman Arkham Origins\n8.5\nPretty Damn Good!","November 8, 2013","true","59.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They complain about it not having many changes compared to it predecessor, but YET they gave CoD of Doge an 8.8… Clearly IGN is being paid off here, either that or they got someone who is a big CoD fan to review the game. At least the community votes reveal the truth, as the community gave Origins an 8.9 and CoD of Doge a 3.2.\n","December 28, 2013","true","18.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Batman: Arkham Origins feels like a game from the Arkham Franchise. But also, it feels completely different.. The story, the music, the sounds, the gameplay, everything seems to be completely different in comparison with Batman: Arkham City, Batman; Arkham Asylum and Batman; Arkham Knight, but at the same time, you can feel that it belongs to them, on the one or other wise. It is indeed not as good as the other parts, but it deserves to be called "Arkham" nevertheless. If you should buy it? Definetely, if you already have the other games of the Arkham Franchise and like them. But if you dont know the others, i would advise to buy another Batman game, like my all-time favourites Batman: Arkham City and Batman: Arkham Knight.","July 1, 2015","true","50.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Likely.\n\nIs BAO more worthy of a 7.0 than a higher score as IGN review. In my honest opinion, yes. Sure, that score comes from the same people who were happy to rate arguably the most iterative popular game series, Call of Duty, with scores of 9 or higher, which doesn't make sense when their biggest argument for the score is the lack on innovation....By that standard, BAO would get a 10/10.\n\nMy score boils down to the fact that while there is still the solid, Batman Arkham series base mechanics and design, there are many minor or moderate imperfections compared to previous games.\n\nNumber one issue is the bugginess, with the infamous Lacey Tower Glitch (now fixed), interrogation glitches, geometry collisions glitches and to me, the loss of combos or the missing of attacks more than I should have compared to previous games (this could be an issue with my controller or just me).\n\nNumber two, the total lack of detail and flair compared to the previous games - there is less color variety (mostly greys, blacks, greens, and occasional blues), practically no environmental easter eggs and references (though, you can argue the fact that the villains don't have the ability to uniquly mark their territory like Arkham City because civilians and cops are still present), no interesting items to scan (except for Anarky tags), less entertaining Riddler/Enigma quest (The interesting Riddler trophies are now just boring Grey and bright green datapacks, that some how James Gordon didn't notice on his back wall with a BLARING GREEN LIGHT. The puzzles are immensely easier than BAC and argueably kind of stupid, and makes you wonder how Enigma thought Batman couldn't get them. Admittedly, Engima is perhaps less experienced/adept and hasn't became "The Riddler" yet).\n\nNumber Three, a near complete lack of innovation and recycling of assets that makes BAO feels like a glorified DLC for Arkahm City. While it it great to see what "Arkham City" was before it was Arkham City, the vast majority of the city is a damn near copy and past of AC, but without all the interesting signs, graffiti, displays, and destruction. There are still a few neon signs and normal billboards, but the city feels ironically less alive despite the fact that cops and civilians are still present (in which you never see any hint that civilians are still in the city except for murder cases, abandoned cars, and occasional hobos). The combat is mostly the same with a couple of new gadgets: A concussion sticky grenade that stuns small groups of enemies and shock gauntlets that makes Batman overpowered. Thankfully, the camera angles are improved when you make the last hit of a fight, however, it seemed I would miss attacks or loose combos unnecessarily and the combat feels even more reliant on countering relentlessly attacking goons. Thanks to a combat bug, many times I would finish a fight with a group while one thug was still in a fight stance, but not attacking. The game would recognize the fight as complete and give you XP, but you woulld have to punch or batarang the enemy (which sometimes misses at POINT BLANK). I even had another bug where a thug got stuck in a car and I had to use explosive gel to get him out.\n\nThe mutliple problems with the game left me feel like I should breeze through the story as fast as I can to get it over with. However, the story is definitely the strongest point of this game. You get to see the character dynamics between Batman, his Bruce Wayne identity (which honestly, may have been better if explored just a little bit more), and characters such as Alfred, the Gordons, and Joker. The more cunning, Less dumb Bane of the earlier games (Which is explained in the story) and the discovery of the Joker kept me interested despite me essentially knowing what was going to happen since this is an Origin story. The problem with the origin story is though, you don't get alot of information of the pure origins of Wayne becoming Batman (the suit and gear, the first outings of The Bat, his training and pre-Batman Life) and publisher/dev made the decision to put this content in upcoming DLC, because they can and want to make money. As for the predator (stealth segments), they work exactly the same, which is fine with me, but you will be stuck in Detective mode 95% time and sometimes you wonder how goons miss Batman grapneling or sneaking right in front of them.\n\nI have yet to mess with the multiplayer. The idea stems from a little assemetry thanks to two groups of thugs shooting each other (with apparently terrible gun mechanics from what I read) while dealing with the threats of Batman and Robin and the mission to "summon" the playable bosses Bane and the Joker.\n\nIn the end, despite my criticisms, it's still a mostly solid Batman game that fits within the Akrham series and if you're a big fan of, is still worth playing. The base mechanics of combat, gliding, stealth and exploration are still here in full force - it ticks all the marks of a Batman Arkham series game, but just does that and nothing else - which makes the game uninnovative (comapred from the shift from Asylum to City) and the city is nearly so dull and drab that it made me want to rush the game. The huge fan that I was, ordered the collectors PS3 edition and thIs PC version to download/install overnight since I couldn't pick up my PS3 version on midnight and had to wait until the next store opening - I now regret that because I've spent too much money on this. If you were waiting anxiously for the next Arkham game, then definitely get it, but if you're like Many Steam gamers with massive backlogs and can wait, then look out for a 25-50% off sale or better.","December 2, 2013","true","40.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If it wasn't for the bugs that liter this game, then this game would be a full fledged complete package that would be well worth your time and money. The single player is very good overall. the graphics are great, the pc port is managable, the game mechanics without a rebind of keys is reasonably good and can be used easily when put in comparison to a controller. the multiplayer admittedly being rather sparse in terms of it's game modes and amount of maps, is fun, enjoyable and can get very tense especially in the hunter, hunted game mode which plays like search and destroy in call of duty in the sense that you have one lifeand one only, die and thats it, very emersive indeed. But the bugs in this game seriously hamper the amount of enjoyment you will be able to extract out of this title. in addition to the bugs, the developers of this title have no current plans to fix and improve the game which is bad and near insulting to hardcore batman fans and fans of the previous arkham titles. therefore i cannot recommend buying this game to anyone unless you are willing to encounter and ignore the near game breaking bugs that currently exist in the game then by all means play and enjoy but for the rest of us, i suggest staying away from this game.","June 28, 2014","false","20.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This is the first game in the series I have played extensively, despite owning the other two titles.\nThis game follows Batman/Bruce Wayne on Christmas Eve in Gotham City; the villain Black Mask places a significant bounty on your head, meaning the best and brightest villains flock to Gotham on Christmas Eve to take down Batman. I thought this was a great way to provide diversity in the villains you'll encounter, each with their own characteristics and different fighting styles; Bane, Copperhead, the Joker, Deadshot, Mad Hatter, Deathstroke, Electrocutioner and the Penguin are all villains that Batman will encounter in one way or another. The voice acting and motion capture of these characters is absolutely brilliant, and it was very enjoyable to face off against them.\nThis game is a sprawling open world brawler; Batman has a number of tools and gadgets to navigate the vast environments such as grappling hooks, glue grenades, smoke grenades and batarangs, all of which come in useful in a variety of ways. You can glide across the cityscape uninterrupted; this is one of the best features of the game, as the player is allowed to navigate the world as you choose without limitation.\nGameplay in Arkham Origins consists of engaging in fist fights with goons, sneaking around areas, solving puzzles and gliding around Gotham. Like previous entries in the series, Arkham Origins uses the freeflow combat system; as Batman, you can fly around a punch up whilst delivering hits and countering attacks. Different enemies require different fighting styles and techniques, and the enemy diversity as well as the range of tools means the fights are always entertaining and challenging. The stealth sections are equally entertaining, as you can use your tools and the environment to eliminate enemies undetected. You'll also come across challenging puzzles within the game, such as bypassing traps and blocked areas as well as solving puzzles left by Enigma.\nVideo and sound design in this game is also very good. Excellent attention to detail in combination with a highly appealing graphics engine, this game looks absolutely stunning on high settings. Voice acting and sound design is also fantastic, and feels like a highly authentic Batman experience.\nThis game was very enjoyable due to its highly polished gameplay and compelling story. Without spoilers, the scenes concerning the Joker and his early meetings with Batman provide a unique take on the story that I found extremely interesting and riveting for the game. If you enjoy action packed brawlers in an open world setting, I highly recommend this game.

I know a lot of people claim that, but I challenge anyone to find a Batfan as big as me. I loved Asylum and City, and when I saw Origins was being delivered by a different studio, I swore never to play it.\n\nAnd then it went on sale.\n\nFiguring 'hey, what's ten bucks?', I bought it. I now have no idea what people are/were complaining about. Yes, there are some shortcomings when compared to the previous games, but that comes with any franchise. I mean, what if nobody played another Zelda game after Ocarina of Time? People talked crap about Windwaker, but it's one of my favourite games.\n\nArkham Origins is a superb game. It's Batman all over. Does it hold up to its preceeding titles? Not 100%. But you can't let two near perfect games ruin a wonderful one. Is it worth $50? That's up to you. But if it goes on sale again, I thoroughly recommend picking it up.

If it wasn't for the bugs that liter this game, then this game would be a full fledged complete package that would be well worth your time and money. The single player is very good overall. the graphics are great, the pc port is managable, the game mechanics without a rebind of keys is reasonably good and can be used easily when put in comparison to a controller. the multiplayer admittedly being rather sparse in terms of it's game modes and amount of maps, is fun, enjoyable and can get very tense especially in the hunter, hunted game mode which plays like search and destroy in call of duty in the sense that you have one lifeand one only, die and thats it, very emersive indeed. But the bugs in this game seriously hamper the amount of enjoyment you will be able to extract out of this title. in addition to the bugs, the developers of this title have no current plans to fix and improve the game which is bad and near insulting to hardcore batman fans and fans of the previous arkham titles. therefore i cannot recommend buying this game to anyone unless you are willing to encounter and ignore the near game breaking bugs that currently exist in the game then by all means play and enjoy but for the rest of us, i suggest staying away from this game.","June 28, 2014","false","20.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gaarasandwraith/recommended/209000/","gaarasandwraith","medaltable","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gaarasandwraith/","286 products in account","-> MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD <-\n\nBatman Arkham Origins when it was initially released had too many bugs to count, that frankly not only ruined the overall\nexperience but in some cases made the game literally unplayable. Having played the previous Arkham games and seeing the Trailer for the game I got really hyped, it looked promising. So how does the game fare?\n\n-Intro:\nTo start off - the setting is great, playing the role of an unrefined Batman struggling to survive on Christmas Eve being targeted by 8 hired killers of Black Mask and the one and only - Joker whilst getting to know himself, what he wants, his ambitions and goals in life and who he is or will become, how to world views him. Meeting familiar faces and forging the friendships and rivalries we know and love from DC characters.\n\n-Story\nThe Story is mediocre and it throws its trump-card, the big reveal WAY TO EARLY!\nI don't want to spoil anything so I won't continue with this section.\n\n-The World\nThe game starts at the Blackgate Prison Facility, being overrun by criminals, and the beloved "super-criminals". Batman has to investigate who is behind the prison break and put an end to their deeds. While the prison segment is great, the intro fantastic, and later being introduced to all the assassin that you will face later on, with amazing backstories and cinematics, through that little segment the goals are set and you have a purpose as a player and as Batman!\n\n<->And it pretty much goes downhill from here except one or two points in the game.<->\n\nGetting to explore all of Gotham sounded great! (on paper) The game features the same places as Arkham City, adding in the rest of Gotham (an island south of the Arkham part) Two equally large places for you to travel and explore! The game introduces a fast travel option which makes the whole exploration thing a lot faster getting from place to place. One of the biggest drawbacks of this game is that freeroaming Gotham isn't as fulfilling or satisfying as the previous game.\nThe world is really bland (going as far as to say the city feels dead at some parts). The snow that is covering ALL of Gotham is there so they can hide the fact that they are unable to create a lust and immersive city for the player to explore and interact.\nYou will feel like you are making circles around the place or just seeing the same places over and over again, because you can't tell where you are going or making progress, forcing you to open and close the map every 5 seconds to get your bearings. Both upper and southern Gotham, are 99% most of the part boring, they don't offer any interesting places to explore and the places that are rehashed are more interesting that the new places (solely for the fact that you want to find how much bland the Arkham City part is).\nIn contrast-> Arkham City felt alive, every detail there made the gameworld so much more vivid and much more interesting to explore, it gave the motivation to learn more about this place and its habitats/prisoners/criminals. Listening to prisoners talking to each other, badmouthing their bosses, witnessing prisoners bullying other prisoners, other random events, from the carefully placed billboards featuring known places to people who read the comics or seen the movies. Everything was placed with care and Rocksteady with respect to the Batman/DC lore. Getting to know the villains from their interesting and long side-missions, sympathize with them and pity them at the same time.\n\n[That brilliant writing from Rocksteady isn't here to no-ones surprise]\n\n-The Side-mission Characters\nWhile great in the comics, here they are pushed aside for no reason, the missions are rushed and the payoff isn't at all great or fulfilling and you will end up wanting more of these characters, without recordings, no other interactions, all but one or two missions are very anti-climactic and feel half-arsed. The other new addition is the "extensive" (in quotations) detective mode, which would have made you feel more like Batman, while the concept seems promising it isn't executed well. The game will hold your hand throughout all of the investigation scenes, telling you exactly where the interaction points are, while looking cool and impressive your involvement in this as a player is minimal at best.\n\n-The Gameplay\nIts pretty much the same as City, but slightly changed so that is more forgiving with the addition of some charged fists weapon. The combat might seem the same to a lot of people but from my experience with it, it is more cheap that City, when a enemy swings his fist, sometimes it connects when it shouldn't and feels more clunky and unnatural,\n(Like the Batman vs Bane fight in the Dark Knight Rises, HEYO!)\nI came to that conclusion because having finished every Riddle combat challenge with every character in Arkham City, (which is a lot) I have a near perfect understanding of the combat system and can safely say that they ruined the combat formula by changing little things here and there.\n\nThe last things that needs to be addressed are the\n\n-Boss Fights\nand\n-Voice Acting\n\nBatman is not voiced by Mr. Conroy anymore and Joker not by Mark Hamill. Which turned many people off, it was little discouraging I'll be honest, the fact that THE definite voices for these two characters are getting replaced is off-putting. Batman's new voice is surprisingly very fitting and suits the character and timeline VERY well, the actor portrays him faithfully and is a welcome addition and worthy (If you may) to play the Batman role.\nOn the other hand we have Troy Baker taking the role of the Joker. Honestly I was in shock when I heard his voice in the game, the laugh was SPOT ON and portrayed the character to a T. I'll go on a whim and say that he is ON PAR with Mark Hamill, In my humble and honest opinion no-one could have voice this Young Joker more *perfectly* that Baker. I was honestly scared when he made a threat (Like the Nolan Joker) always laughing even when beaten to a pulp.\nThey can't replace them but where a welcome and great addition to the franchise.\n\nThe thing that is bar none, no questions asked, no argument here: are the boss fights (most of them a least)\nThe payoff is fulfilling and deserving to call itself an Arkham game based on how it handled the boss fights.\nFor the most part they are diverse and unique. The most hyped battle in the game with Deathstroke, delivers ALL it promises:\n(Black-Bar Short Description about the fight )\n\n---Very Minor Spoilers---\n\nFluid combat, different stances/phases, gadget integration, PRECISE counter-presses, satisfying and INTENSE fight sequence. The fight will be most enjoyed with Hard mode ON, NO COUNTER-ICON indication.\nIt is one of the best boss fights ever and the most difficult in the series yet.\nLosing 4-5 times before nailing Slade. The downside is that you will never see Slade again, only in some ending cut-scene\n\nFINAL PART (PROS)\n\n1)Fantastic Voice Acting\n2)Great looking visuals/textures\n3)Great Boss Fights\n\nFINAL PART (CONS)\n\n1)Uninteresting Game World\n2)Mediocre Plot\n3)Bugs/Glitches (Gamebreaking ones, official patches/support ended)\n4)Unbalanced Gadgets\n5)Not fleshed out side-characters\n6)Multiplayer still unbalanced and may never be fixed\n7)Rehashed assets not put to good use.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game despite its pros. They are way, way outnumbered, I would recommend buying Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, they are VASTLY superior to this title, its just not up to par. I could recommend it only to the hardcore die-hard fans of the Bat and the series and only after a huge price drop.\n\n---EDITOR NOTES---\n\nThank you for reading my first game review, I want to do more of these so if you feel so inclined, PM me your thoughts, positive/negative, criticism is much appreciated :)\n+English is not my native language sorry for any syntax or grammatical error/mistakes.","April 9, 2014","false","29.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

In this game you play as the one and only Batman trying to stop yet again villians on the loose in gotham city. In paticular, you are trying to stop a crime lord named Black Mask, and the eight assassins he's hired to try and kill you for 50,000,000 dollars.\n\nThe games story overall was interesting and I have to say compared to the others, the story was just as awesome with the plot twists and all. However, if I were to compare this game to the game that came before this, (Batman Arkham City) I have to say there was really no difference what so ever. Sure, you can play as deathstroke, and sure, the story is different, and sure they're are some new villians, but besides that what was the big improvement of this game?\n\nBatman Arkham Origins honnestly feels like if you were playing Arkham City, but you bought some dlc that took place before arkham asylum, with a different story. Combat is the same, if anyway different its gotten alot harder, although it does have a bit of a different feel to it. Same gadgets, same challenges, and not even that much bigger of a map. Now, I will say this. The boss battles/fighting with the villans has improved and generally feels great. Although the combat hasn't changed, if you do like a good challenge then its for you.\n\nSince I haven't played arkham city in a long time, I can't really tell if this game had more or less side quests, but I have a feeling there are more, and if not, the same. The riddler challenges are little bit eaiser as your map can now locate almost every challenge in the game, other then finding them on your own, but only really do it if you want to...put hours in this game? Or perhaps if you're very fond with the riddler, and want to catch him.\n\nThe voice actor of Batman in the game sadly wasn't Kevin Conroy and instead was Roger Craig Smith. I suppose the intention of doing this was to...perhaps make the player feel it was a more younger version of Batman? The voice actor for Joker has also changed, but I never really even realised it did. The one and only Troy Baker is the voice actor for The Joker, and has done a great job. Compared to the last voice actor, they're both awesome.\n\nNow when it comes to DLC for this game, there are some ups and downs.\n\nCold, Cold Heart had a decent story, and the main villians focus on the penguin and Mr. Freeze. You also get to play as Batman in his new Environmental Bat/XE Suit. Some features inculde a fire batarang, and instead of shock gloves, you have heat gloves. There is free roam, but you can only explore half of Gotham instead of the full two areas. After the story, you can do mainly three side missions. You can unfreeze all the people who have been frozen, stop anarky from once again terriozing the city, and tag anarky symbols. I'd say its worth the 10 bucks. On the other hand initiation and the skin packs didn't really feel worth buying. The skin packs are honnestly dumb, compared to city, city had amazing skins. Arkham Origins skins were as if the designers of the game minds were up there ♥♥♥ and tried to make a good costume while it was. The challenges are only worth buying if you find the game easy. I personally am just fine with easy, normal for me almost felt like ultimate towards the end of the game.\n\nInitiation doesn't really even feel like a story, more like just a bunch of challenges in korea with Bruce without his suit. For those of you who don't know what initian is, its basically the story of how Bruce learned his ways of martial arts, knowing the way of how to fight, and overcome his fear but also to use it and fear others. That is what it was suppose to be, but its just a bunch of challenges as far as im concerned. Sure there is a chellenge campaign, but one cutscene for every challenge with Ras Al Ghul giving him challenge after challenge. Where is the real story here? There isn't, and its also pretty challenging. I would reccomend though beating the game first before you try it. If you want to play a game that shows Bruce actully before he became Batman, either play Batman Begins for ps2 (great game), or watch the movie. (Movie is pretty good. 9/10)\n\nMods in this game are pretty fun, as they're mods where you can be Deathstroke, Anarky, Joker and some other villians and roam the city. Only do this if you've beaten the game though. There are some costume mods, but I could only find ones that are the suits from the batman movies. Other then that, there isn't really anything else big for mods.\n\n\nOverall, I have to say, the origins of Batman put into a game is good if you do it right. It honestly just feels like arkham city though, and there wasn't really a big difference compared to city. Only really get this game if you want a good Batman story or to play as deathstroke. Besides that, there really isn't a point getting the game.\n\n\nAs for the future for Rocksteady with their new Batman game, Batman Arkham Knight, I will say this.\n\nNow I am the type of person to expect a game to be good, but also to be expected unsurpirsingly bad. But, I will say this. Batman Arkham Knight looks honnestly, amazing. The gameplay shows promise, the graphics look great, batman himself looks awesome, and you get to drive the godamm batmobile. I am also excited to see the arkham knight into action and know the story of who he is and all that. Although the trailers for most games are half truth half bull, I have faith the game will still be pretty great. And compared to the other arkham games, this looks likes a whole new generation of Batman and I have some faith Rocksteady can make an even better Batman game in the future with the next gen consoles.\n\nAs for Arkham Origins -\n\n8.5/10","August 2, 2014","true","34.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The controls, looks and overall execution are just fine (as they should be, since it's primarily just borrowed from the previous titles), but the scale of the game falls significantly short of Arkham City.\n\nI don't think purists will be the only people irritated by the anacronystic, and fairly schizophrenic, way that this origins Batman has advanced, and regressed, from his Arkham predecessors... wait... successors... well, you see my point.\n\nAnyway, overall, not actually a bad game, but when compared to the excellent games from which it was spawned, you must wonder if it's existance was necessary as it seems to do nothing to advance the franchise.\n\nThat said, if cheap enough, and you just want more Arkham, pick up this game... just set those expectations down a level or two, and you won't be disappointed.","February 10, 2015","true","8.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Batman: Arkham Origins deserves none of the hate it gets from fans of the Batman games. I'll tell you one thing, though, WB did not innovate too much on the gameplay from the previous Arkham games. But, I ask you a question: is this really a bad thing? WB was wise to do this instead of taking the risk to change the game in a series that doesn't belong to them. So, what we get is another Batman game that lets us explore Gotham City once again and relive the beginning of the Dark Knight. The story, by the way, is a great excuse to throw in some SICK boss battles. The boss battles are each so different and challenging, I'll tell ya. And while I hear this game has major bugs at launch, all seem to be entirely fixed at this point in time, more than a year after launch. Speaking of fixes, this PC port is AMAZING! It runs beautifully, all settings maxed out, getting 40 fps (which is good enough for me for a 3rd person game) on my GT755M, a laptop graphics card, mind you. And with all of the nvidia-specific features, you'll be happy you're a PC gamer. And going back to the game content itself, Batman: Arkham Origins has the usual massive amount of side quests and things to do outside of story missions. Now, I've, for the most part, only played the story missions, but I plan on going back soon enough to do more side quests. One string of side quests I saw a bit of on youtube has you finding the Most Wanted Criminals of Gotham, letting you fight more boss battles, and ultimately squeezing as much as you can out of this worthy entry.

The final boss fight is literally a rehash of the ingenius Mr. Freeze fight from B:AC.  The story is decent & Troy Baker's performance as the Joker is excellent.  Bane is closer to Nolan's version of an intelligent villain rather than the cartoon versions of a stupid brute, so that's good.\n\nI loved Arkham City & while I'd say this game was fun, I understand that they had no original ideas and used Arkham City to tell another Batman story.\n\nFinal verdict: 7.5/10\n\nDLC: How long was it Angry Joe?  3.5-4 hours, including getting all of the achievements.  The story was okay.  Where as the main story had an original take on the Joker and other's origin stories, this was Mr. Freeze's origin story and was pretty much an exact retelling without much deviation from other versions.  At least it felt somewhat different with the new ice moves and stuff, but that's not really enough to recommend at anything over $2.  Oh, and the other DLC in the season pass was some garbage challenge maps and different suits for Batman which you can only use once you've beaten the main game and go for new game plus or plus plus (aka: I Am The Night mode).\n\nFinal verdict there: 6/10 and don't get the season pass","December 19, 2015","true","68.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

It's like asking people to tell the difference between drinking bottled water and municipal water and then asking which one tastes better.\n\nI'll rate this game high, I don't care. There is absolutely nothing wrong with Origins. If Arkham City were the third installment and this were the first one, then people would be making same complaints. I'll settle for the Uncharted 3 argument/syndrome but there is little to no reason to downgrade this game because it more or less features same core gameplay. And WHAT IS that "same"? Refined fighting system, satisfying action, old and new upgrades (that you have to actually work for this time around by completing challenges), expanded itnel/database, enigma's games, superb voice acting, crime investigations, top notch cinematics, joker's side of the story (a clock work orange), a plethora of new and old characters each of whom require a different takedown approach, the perma-death mode, among many other things, the horror!\n\nThere's little to no innovation? Well, for starters you can't innovate much when it comes to something that happened in the past. But there are small changes there and there. You can now slide into the grates and open them. You can daze your foes with smoke and they will swing their arms at each other and punch it each by accident. Many fights are no cakewalk. Many enemies become armed towards the middle of the game, the ninjas, the martial arts experts and Bane's brawlers can make fights quite tough. The environments are also more varied. There is still no blood splatter anywhere, however. Many fights requires preparation in advance - disable guns, check; disable gun crates check; mark the ones you want to bump together, check; throw the smoke pellet in the middle of the crowd, check; swoop in and start kicking ♥♥♥.\n\nThe game is considerably longer than the other two. It took me 30 straight hours to beat it and I have only completed around 60% of the game. The game literally goes on and on.\n\nThe game is much more Tim Burton-y this time around. There are more highrise buildings so there is greater satisfaction of gliding and plunging down. The city is filled with gangs and crimes that you can prevent. The streets are wide so there is more maneuverability. There is more approach to targets. The old Arkham City area is filled with somewhat disturbing Christmas decorations. The art design is off the charts. I also like the fact that you are kind of on your own in a sense that cops and criminals don't really know what to make of you. The graphics are also somewhat expanded, noticably the lens flare, the smoke that adjusts to your movement and changes its shape (nonexistent on the consoles), and physx (ah, those snowflakes dancing around when you fight 10 people at the same time - the consolites are missing out), AND LET'S NOT FORGET THERE IS NO GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE.\n\nEach boss fights requires a level of investigation, psychological build up and later on skill and patience - something that Arkham City wasn't too famous for later in the game (which was one of GS's gripes by the way). The ultimate bane fight was as close to the Mr. Freeze fight as it got. The uneasy alliance with Gordon was also played out pretty well.\n\nI can only wish this was the first installment. Arkham City was pretty much a perfect game but it doesn't preclude Origins from being a great game.\n\nP.S.

Arkham Origins is a masterpiece. The new voice actors were spot on, and they kept the game play the way we all came to love and enjoy. The story was fantastic, it was beyond flawless. Making a prequel to the events in Asylum and City and mastering it is not an easy feat. It was laid out perfectly and I loved the way they portrayed each faction and the way they reacted. Perfect 10 out of 10.\n\nMultiplayer was actually a lot of fun and definitely a great added addition to an amazing series. (After you got over the random crashes that randomly occured). I hope to see them fine tone it, if they decide to do it again. When I completed the achievements only one mode was unlocked,, however I know now they added another mode, but it would be nice to see that happen during the initial release.\n\nMost DLC is mainly silly skins and a couple challenges(not needed for achievements), but the one DLC that is actually worth something was the Cold Cold Heart DLC.\n~ It adds as much as the Harley Quinn DLC in Arkham City did, and it was very well done. The story was spectacular and I enjoyed the way they developed it and how it connects all the puzzle pieces. Also the new batsuit was badass and needs to make a reappearance.","April 27, 2014","true","81.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Most people prefer Asylum and City, since they were developed by Rocksteady instead of WB Montreal; while I don't necessarily prefer Origins, it didn't disappoint me either. One thing that is MUCH better about it is the visual detail and overall smoothness of gameplay. With my system (specs at the bottom) and new drivers, I play Origins in 3D Vision, rendered at 4K (using DSR), with EVERY setting maxed, except for AA being on TXAA low plenty smoothly enough for me to play very enjoyably and literally be blown away by the Nvidia Physx and rich visual detail all around! The footprints and thug impressions in the snow, the the sense I should be feeling the snowflakes hitting my face, the fun of demolishing the thugs, the joy of exploring the richly-detailed city as the Batman, along with many more great points make it great! This game has the same style and feel of the earlier games, which is AWESOME, and offers players a MUCH larger map to roam around as they wish! Great game, worth the money, and worth many hours of immersive gameplay!\nCan't wait for Arkham Knight (back to Rocksteady)!\n\nSystem Specs:\nCase: NZXT Phantom 001BK\nCPU: Intel i7 3970X\nMOBO: ASUS Rampage IV Extreme x79\nRAM: 32GB 1600 DDR3 4x8GB (Quad channel)\nGPU: EVGA GTX 780 Classified w/ ACX cooler\nSound Card: Creative Sound Blaster Recon 3D Champion\nRaid 1 for OS: 2 10,000 RPM 300GB VelociRaptors\n1TB 7200RPM data drive\nMonitor: Asus VG248QE 144Hz refresh, 1ms response, 80M:1 Contrast Ratio, 3D Vision support\nSurround Sound: Logitech THX-certified Z-5300e","November 21, 2014","true","140.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The game that I played right after preloading it. The game I completed 100% in less than a month after the games release. I am going to say I was in love yet also dissapointed with this game. First of all the game is very alike to arkham city with I am completely fine with. But the changes I found in the free-flow combat and predator missions were bad. With predator moving to gargoyle to gargoyle is not as smooth as the previous games and silent takedowns sort of glich out with their knockout smash's. In free-flow, the game has lost it's rythm with going from enemy to enemy. With that a side let's talk about the story. While not written by Paul Dini (the writer of asylum and city) instead it is written by Corey May and Dooma Wendschuh, which is fine because the story is great, but leads to a lot of screwed up continuity with Dini's work. Now let's talk about something new: the multiplayer. The multiplayer is created by splash damage not WB games Montreal. I found it very enjoyable to play with batman in predator maps with real players. There are two modes from the time of making this review: Invisible Predator Online and Hunter, Hunted. These are both extremely enjoyable and kept me playing. So the final verdict of this review though it is very alike to Arkham City it is still a fun Arkham game and with the addition of multiplayer I recommend this game but, with the bugs, glitches and other problems it detracts for the experience noticeably. So if you like batman and that is what you want more of, buy Arkham Origins. 8.6/10","November 25, 2013","true","316.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

While not a particularly original plot, it is told well and at a good pace. This Batman is younger and more angry, and it was interesting seeing people react to him as a new figure in the city of Gotham. These things alone made the game worth playing. Even the item collecting seemed a bit more grounded, which made that more entertaining as well.\n\nHowever, one is left with the sense that the game simply did not get enough playtesting, or not enough time to react to the results of playtesting. There are minor glitches here and there, but the most glaring oversight is in the combat.\n\nBatman is no longer able to consistently interrupt his own attack animations. This most commonly manifests itself when trying to counter an attack that begins after you've already started attacking someone else. You'll find yourself getting hit a lot more. More difficulty is fine, but not allowing the player to respond to threats as they happen generally makes the combat feel unfair. This seemingly small change makes much of the gameplay less satisfying than in previous iterations, but is rendered moot about 2/3 into the game when you get a new upgrade that makes the combat fairly easy.\n\nBatman Arkham Origins is not a bad game, but given its predecessors and its potential, it is a disappointing one.","February 8, 2014","true","26.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

It wasn't terrible, but they managed to make the most important part of the game frustrating and inconsistant: the combat. In the previous Arkham games, combat flow was silky smooth, and guiding the Batman around the fight was intuitive and consistent. In this game, that all goes away. It is incredibly hard to maintain freeflow, often at no fault of the player (Batman seems to randomly miss blocks and strikes, no matter how you are aiming the camera, and sometimes it is impossible to target the opponent you want, with it seeming like Batman is attacking everyone except the baddy you want him to take out). If these issues were consistent and predictable, it wouldn't be a big deal, but as they aren't, fighting goes from fun to frustrating in a hurry.\n\nGoing back and playing Arkham City after playing this game was like a breath of fresh air.\n\nThis game could have been a worthy addition to the Arkham games, but when it breaks the very thing that makes the Arkham games so much fun, I just can't give it a positive recommendation.","December 19, 2013","false","31.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Nothing that has been game breaking for me but others will tell you that there are some nasty bugs and glitches.\n\nThey have done some 'tweeking' with Arkham Origins that has changed the timing of counters or critical hits. That will have you swinging at air a bit more than in AC. There have been times where I think to myself, "that was cheap" but I have been playing AC lately too (I'm on a Batman junk out) and find there are things in that that also kinda irk me. I think they have done something with the flying/gliding that seem to make it more responsive or just plain easier. Either way I am better at gliding in Origins. As far as the gadgets go it's pretty much a wash.  Except for the remote claw which is overpowered but still hilarious just to sling two foes into each other. Instead of a freeze grenade you have a glue grenade. They do exactly the same things, literally.\n\nAs far as multiplayer goes I can't comment on that. I'm not a big fan of online multiplayer.\n\nOverall, I like Origins a little bit more than City. Whether it's because it's newer and the graphics are nicer (that DX11 snow is wicked), the city seems more fleshed out and brighter, the story having more villains, less Nolan North or the fact that Batman isn't wearing his underwear on the outside (yet).\n\nAt the end of the day I would give this game a 8.5/10. Without really bringing anything completely new to the table I can't give it a much higher score. It's still definitely a must play for comic and Batman fans.","November 26, 2013","true","40.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

On Christmas Eve Black Mask hires 8 assassins to hunt down and kill Batman for 50 million dollars. So it's up to you to capture every assassin and save Gotham.\n\nGameplay is almost identical to Arkham City. It adds new elements like shock gloves that speed up combat, but do less damage. Overall the combat is identical to Arkham City and if you played that you know what to expect.\n\nGraphics are also identical to Arkham City, but unlike AC they add snow and snowing effects and add Christmas decorations to make you feel like Christmas is just around the corner. Graphics are amazing to say the least even though they are just a re-skin.\n\nThe soundtrack is awesome. When you fight some of the bosses and the music kicks in is just awesome and makes the fights even better.\n\nThe game is a bit harder than the other titles. Stealth play's a bigger role in this game and the armed enemies do more damage. But the game is still really easy.\n\nLevel design is mostly taken out of Arkham City, but there are new locations. Overall it's really well made but there is one location that has horrible design is the Gotham Police station. I got lost and confused multiple times. I would have liked for them for not make it that confusing.\n\nGame is pretty long. It took me 17 hours to finish the main story and complete all side quests. 2 hours more to play the Cold, Cold Heart DLC. Not to mention there's also a lot you can do after you finish the game and also there are challenge maps.\n\nThe game is incredibly buggy. During a boss fight, the boss got stuck in a wall. I needed to restart for it work again. Sometimes, I couldn't interrogate people after I beat them up. The game doesn't have any game breaking bugs and restarting from a checkpoint fixes the problem.\n\nThe multiplayer mode is kind of fun but now it's full of hackers and it's kind of hard to get into a game. My suggestion is to skip all MP dlc.\n\nBatman: Arkham Origins isn't as good as the previous titles. The game is buggy and it get's boring really fast, but it's still really fun. The boss battles are interesting and are fun as hell. The story is really interesting too. Overall if you are a fan of Arkham games this is a must own. But my suggestion is to get the game on sale only. I give Batman: Arkham Origins a 7/10","August 22, 2015","true","19.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Rocksteady perfected the combat with Arkham City, but for some reason WB Montreal decided it would be a good idea to tweak things that would create a "no step forward, two steps back" sort of situation. At least on the PC, interrupting attacks to counter foes has been removed. Batman's attack animations are needlessly lengthy and sluggish, creating a situation where trying to attack an attacker head-on will result in Batman being beaten to the punch, 10 times out of 10. There are two problems with this: your default attack button now becomes Counter, and Batman is reduced to lower in skill than a common street thug.\n\nThe changes to the combat compared to Arkham City remove the power fantasy of being Batman. The game was incredibly buggy on release, as well. There are nitpicks, too, like the leveling design being completely linear, or the electric gauntlets basically invalidating any strategy the original two games required for dealing with special foes, but those are minor things. The real issues are in the combat, and when that's most of what this game is, you've got a problem.\n\nPlay Arkham City instead, or wait for Rocksteady's next installment.

It definitely brings many good things Arkham City (and Asylum) had. Similar gadgets, similar combat styles, familiar characters (well, of course, it's Batman after all), and it's always nice to know Batman before he became established super hero. If you've played the previous two, you wouldn't feel any awkwardness playing the game.\n\nNavigating in an open city couldn't be easier. Batman can jump from building to building, grapple with ease - much ease than on AC from my fingers' memory - and now can use 'teleport' aka fast travel with Batwing to reach other corners faster. ...well uh, after completing Tower missions against Enigma, of course.\n\nThere are also many other hidden objects and sidequests you can do like in Arkham City. Enigma Datapack, destroying poison barrels etc. The template pretty much the same like previous installment\n\nPersonal preference: I've played all three Batman installments on Steam, and I feel the smoothest combat is from this Origins.\n\nPerformance wise, so far I am having zero problem with Batman Origins set up on all low settings. On Batman Arkham City, though, I've had considerable slowdown, not because of my weak graphic card, but because it was bugged game engine - thanks to PhysX.\n\nFor the contents on Steam aka DLC, there's zero reason to get multiplayer DLCs. This game's intended to be played as SINGLE player. Why on earth would they be pushing MP contents into Batman I don't know. Just buy the SP DLCs and you're good to go, or wait until GOTY pops up. By that time, then, I think Arkham Knight will have been in existence. Game's on sale for 75% off quite often, so I would recommend to pick it up at that price.\n\nAnd don't forget, this game's best played with controller. I have no issue with both Dinput (using x360ce) and Xinput gamepads.\n\nSo yeah, Arkham Origins is the game you either hate or love. It's a copy paste from previous game, and adds almost nothing except better combat and or navigation in city, perhaps. Well what can I say, don't fix what ain't broken? Isn't that the golden rule?\n\nAt any rate, this game is a must have if you're Batman fans.","December 24, 2014","true","40.1"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","1"

Which is a shame.\n\nThe current state of the game is also buggy to say the least. Just check the forums to see for yourself. Experienced multiple problems when playing which hurts the gameplay.

Like they took Arkham City's world, Asylum's animations and tacked on a crappy multiplayer and made the game buggy as hell.\n\nThe 'origins' storyline felt like a reason to add in the ever-popular Joker and many of the other assassins hardly added anything to the game other than a checklist to complete. The villain roster was decent but none really stood out like in Asylum or City.\n\nRoger Craig Smith as Batman was ok. Too many of his lines were dry and his tone felt forced. Troy Baker's Joker is almost spot on and listening to his dialogue was one of the few immersive moments I've experienced in this title.\n\nIf you want the best Batman experience, play Asylum. It may not be as open-worldy, but the gameplay is tight and focused. I'm glad I only spent $15 on Origins.\n\n6.8/10","December 14, 2013","false","77.9"," 21 of 40 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","21","40","0","0"

Aside from the occassional bugs that you might encounter the game's as solid as it can be.  It really immerses you and gives you the feeling that you're the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Batman.\n\nAs for the story, no more Joker please.  I'm getting sick of it. Joker this, Joker that.  Batman has a lot  of good villains.  Please use them.\n\nThe multiplayer tells a completely different story, though.  Establishing a game is pretty difficult to do as it requires the room to be complete with 8 players before it would start.  Six players will be assigned to the Jokerz and Bane Thugs while the remaining two will be lucky enough to be the Dark Knight or the Boy Wonder.  Of course no one would want to play as a mook so that's already a minus point.  It would be better if the multiplayer is a complete hide-and-seek game featuring other characters from the Bat Family.  That way no one's going to be resentful that they end up as the bad guy.  The multiplayer rules are pretty much comparable to a WWE gimmick match where it can be confusing and unneeded.  Assassin's Creed multiplayer works as everyone can stealth and kill unlike this game's.\n\nThe next time they'll implement a multiplayer make it a predator game where 8 Bat Family members can duke it out.  We can have Batman, Robin, Red Hood II, Azrael, Batgirl, Spoiler, Owl Man, and Nightwing in an 8-player session.\n\nOverall, the game is still a worth-buy especially during sales.  Don't let the poor multiplayer derail you from getting this game as it's still a masterpiece.","April 27, 2014","true","46.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are no mouse settings to change in-game, the default layout for keybindings show a controller first and you have to click another button to find the keyboard, and you can't navigate the map with a mouse. The mouse settings can be changed in a notepad file so it's not that big of a deal. Not being able to control the map with a mouse is irritating as all hell though and is one of my biggest gripes about the game. Not that big of a deal, but constantly irritating.\n\nNow, on to the good. The combat is just like Asylum and City, but with some changes such as the upgrade paths and some of the upgrades. There are actually more ways to counter all those things that were uncounterable in the last game so fighting is now more fluid. The absolute biggest improvement over the last games were the cinematics; they were god damn awesome.  The rest of the game was pretty much the same as the last games, but with a new story.\n\nI didn't play the multiplayer and don't much care to.

I was disapointed about playing as Deathstroke in challenge modes when I found out his entire moveset was coppied from ♥♥♥♥ Greyson(Robin) in "Batman Arkham City". WB Montreal was "lazy" with the game. Slade's sword transition in the boss fight was also a copy of batman's sword fight against Clayface in "Batman Arkham City".  There were no original ideas.

Though it pales in comparison when compared with its predecessors, it was still an enjoyable experience to play. Authough it was developed by Warner Bros. Montreal and not by Rocksteady, who had developed the previous Arkam games, the still got many things right. First of all, the story was captivating. I won't spoil too much, but it was pretty enjoyable. Secondly, the voice work for this game was amazing. Though I would always prefer the classic portrayal of Batman and Joker by Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill respectively, Roger Craig Smith and Troy Baker deliver an exceptional performance. Still, this game has its own fair share of cons. The world felt bleak and without much character, unlike Arkham city, where each segment of the world reflected of the personality of whichever mob was controlling it. Secondly, authough Warner Bros. Montreal tried new and innovative things, afew of them fell short, such as Electricutioner's gloves, which were too overpowered.\nOverall, I would give this game a 7.8 out of 10.\nGood game, but many flaws.","January 1, 2015","true","27.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As the name implies, it takes place before Arkham Asylum and Arkham City.  Bruce Wayne has just gotten into the vigilante business and similar to the movie Batman Begins, the police don't trust him at first.\n\nThe story starts on Christmas Eve. A bounty has been put on Batman's head for $50,000,000.  That's really all I'm going to say about it -- I don't want to spoil anything.\n\nGameplay-wise, the game is open world (much like Arkham City).  I prefer this to the linear nature of Arkham Asylum, but this game is not as polished as Arkham City/Asylum were.  Certain button prompts don't always register and the first boss fight was glitchy.\n\nSpeaking of which, I really did not like the boss fights in this game.  The boss fights in Asylum and City were fairly fun and unique, but all of the boss fights involve either :\na) Dodge attacks, use your cape stun, and then go for a beatdown. You'll probably have to fight annoying cannon-fodder thugs too.\nb) Avoid the boss and use grates/vents to sneak on them.  Attack them when prompted and then go back to hiding. Then use grates/vents again and repeat until they are defeated.\n\nDespite those complaints, I think the game has a fairly good story.  I don't want to spoil anything, but there are some really great moments.\n\nOverall, Arkham Origins is slightly weaker than Arkham City and Asylum, but still a fairly fun game.","October 25, 2014","true","14.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everyone seems to complain about bugs and glitches but I completed the game without encountering more than 2. The two which did come up cleared by itself within 10 seconds. The story in my opinion is the best out of the series because unlike the previous ones which seemed to almost be like a montage of Batman Adventures, this one shows Batman going through some growth. It feels more like a movie because the main character does not stay static like the previous ones. I love the new voice actors and it's a great re assurance that we will still have Batman and Joker in the future since Konroy and Hamill seem to be retiring soon. The boss fights are quite good, I really don't get what everyone is saying. Although the mechanics are pretty much the same as City's it feels just as satisying to clear a room as it always had. If it ain't broke don't fix it. The cutscenes are amazing and the soundtrack complements them better than City did. Graphics of course have been improved and the added part of Gotham is great to see since it contrasts the Old Gotham so much.\n\nTL;DR, Judge this game for yourself and not join the circle jerk of "omg so many bugs" because there really aren't that many.","January 2, 2015","true","26.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Compelled by the previous games Warner Bros trys to live up the the expectations and level of gameplay of the previous games (Developed by Rocksteady Studios). To the user telling the diffrence in the studio change is quite simple and can be seen from the begining of the game. Compared to previous games this one is the worst in the series. The story is good but that is all that can be really said about it. The game also ranks in many bugs and sometimes can leave you puzzed for hours figuring out how you get out of a room. The single best game of all the Arkham games is the combat system. Superb! This game does not let you down there.\n\nWould i recommend this game? Yes because this game offers a fun gameplay experience and the combat system alone is a great reason alone to play this game.\n\n8.5/10 - "Great Game but let down by Bugs"","January 2, 2015","true","15.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My first playthrough was cut short at over 30% completion when my Batman exited a building and fell into a bottomless void, and of course the game autosaved there. Nothing new is added to the gameplay, though it is arguably more challenging, and the one amazing new gadget of course raises questions about the continuity of the series. If you do own another system however, I highly recommend getting it for that.

If you liked Arkham City, and you want to play it again but you're tired of the dialogue, here's your chance.  There are one or two new tweaks to the combat system and gadgets, but from all the trailer content we definitely saw that coming.  The story's not bad, but actually I liked it more before the plot twist came in.  Dialogue was excellent, and I really liked watching characters bring up why Batman is not the right answer to every problem.\n\nThere's a lot more emphasis on boss fights in this entry, and some of them are cool!  But some of them are quite frustrating, especially since this game seems to be a bit buggier than the two before it.  This probably has something to do with the larger scale.  Since the only thing to do in this larger world is fight goons, and you will assuredly find more goons.  Combat is just about the same as Arkham City, so to me this more felt like padding the game's length than an actual improvement.","January 16, 2014","true","24.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In this game we finally get to see the Bat Cave (not the backup bat cave at Asylum).  It looks pretty awesome and you could see some technology being worked on like the bat mobile.  The map, however, is a bit bigger since they split it into two sections Old Gotham (The one in City) and New Gotham.  There's fast travel in the game to help us get to spot to spot so we don't have to glide all the way to an desination.  Solving a crime scene is fun to watch.  For some reason the Joker seems a little brighter and happier than in City and Asylum (but it could just be me so I don't know).

Not the best sure... But still overwhelmingly good!\n\nThe backlash at this game is surely reasonable, seeing that it's done by a new developer and as such is not a Rocksteady game. But, the backlash is unjustifiable. This game is really good and a solid addition to the Arkham series. It may not be Rocksteady, and may not be too innovative. But it does innovate and does the Batman: Arkham formula right!\n\nThe game's story is set on Christmas Eve when Black Mask decides to put a bounty on a very young Batman, who's still in his second year of crime fighting, which attracts the world's 8 deadliest assassins to track him down. The story is easily the best part about the game and is a very good Batman story. It does what other Arkham games dind't do, which is explore the dynamic between Batman and his allies, mainly Alfred, Barbara (AKA Batgirl) and Comissioner Gordon. The story is set 5 years before Asylum, but quite honestly, it should be 10. The characters are way, WAY younger than their Asylum counterparts and really, since Asylum depicts Tim Drake as being the current Robin, while Origins depicts Batman working alone. It just doesn't fit well... but that's a nitpick.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are pretty much the same as City. Free flow combat. Stealth gameplay. Crime scene investigations. Open world gliding and grappling. Riddler trophies. It's really similar to City, but still has some twists of its own. Some new gadgets such as the Reverse Claw and the Concussion Detonator offer some cool dynamic gameplay mechanics to both Stealth and Combat. New enemy types such as the Martial Artist are also a very welcome addition that really make combat much more interesting and less repetitive.\n\nIt's easily noticeable that this isn't a Rocksteady game since the way the grappling works and the enemy AI are, really feel different... I feel like this is a nitpick, but it's just something I felt having played both other Batman games. Still, glitches and bugs were a rare occasion for me personally, yet I felt they were more than City or Asylum ever had.\n\nMultiplayer is interesting, offering a 3v3v2 scenario. Playing as a goon in Joker and Bane's gangs is acceptable. It's a very standard 3rd person shooter. Still, the feeling of having Batman or Robin on your tail really helps you understand how the goons you beat up in singleplayer feel like. Batman and Robin themselves are the same as usual, but knowing that the goons you take out are players really change the feeling of pulling off a sucessful takedown. The assymetric aspect of the multiplayer however is its downfall. Having Batman, Robin, Joker, Bane and goons all play different is not only confusing, but also frustrating since you never seem to catch a break and play with who you want.\n\nThis is a Batman game however and what matters is the singleplayer. Thankfully Arkham Origins delivers a good Batman experience with some minor tweaks but innovations nonetheless. An amazing story and the solid gameplay from past Arkham games make it a very cool game. Just don't expect a Rocksteady game. Still, WB Montreal's first game is an amazing one for a first game.\n\nBuy it if you want some more Batman action before Arkham Knight. It's really good but if City was just the ammount of Batman you were craving, you can skip it without missing out on too much. But, if you haven't played the others, by all means, buy this game. It's really good!\n\nHighly recommend it.","January 1, 2015","true","25.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Whenever the reins of a franchise is handed over to another developer, there's always that worry of how the end result will turn out and in this case, I don't think you'd even notice any difference whatsoever. The game follows the formula of the previous games almost to a fault and while it doesn't come close to matching Arkham City, there's a few moments within the story that really stand out from the series that I think it should be remembered for. If you've enjoyed Asylum or City, you'll enjoy this. If this is your first Batman game, while there's nothing really wrong with this, I'd probably encourage you to play Asylum first.","August 24, 2014","true","20.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've even complaints about it having obscure villains...If you don't know who Deathstroke and Deadshot are (btw these are hardly obscure characters) then you should really revisit your batman lore.\n\nThe boss fights are extraordinary and who doesn't want to play batman when he's first introduced to some of the most infamous villains in gotham?

I was really hoping this game could match them, or get close. I can say that this game is absolutely beautiful, well optimized, and definitely worth a playthrough.\n\nHowever, it absolutely does not live up to the other Arkham games. For some reason the main story feels way too rushed, not to mention short (6 Hours Tops), and the game as a whole seems to rely on the majority of the content being challenge maps. I can enjoy challenge maps, but after playing so much of two other games with the same combat, Im kind of burnt out of just fighting dudes after dudes for no reason.\n\nThere were many parts of the game in which I thought were very well done including environmental design, especially inside the buildings, although the city area as a whole seemed dull. Seeing as this is my review, Im am going to tell you why I was upset about this game because of lacking portrayals of two characters:\n\nJOKER: I think troy baker did some good work, but honestly, it was noticeably off, and with the joker I need him to be perfect or I get really sad. His appearance reminded me of a small elf that grew some legs and put on facepaint, but the joker is the joker and I love it just the same.\n\nHARLEEN QUINZEL: This game made me think it would deliver the gripping Harley/Joker backstory in which I love so much, and it even had a build up in the character development, but then it seems they forgot about the whole situation and left it alone. I am still upset that they didnt finish what they started, especially when it comes to my 2 favorite Batman characters.\n\nOverall, the game is enjoyable, but certainly does not live up to its predecessors. If you are playing this game for the story, go ahead, but you may just end up feeling like something is missing. In the past two games I got 100% and for this game I just didnt feel like it was worth it.

Now you might be asking yourself: lol is dis duud on meth or sumting. Well, actually you might think that I'm gonna say some logical reason for making such a statement(not the meth thing). So le't get down to it.\n\nThe fighting and stealth are both still really fun. So what is the problem? Well the problem is that they are indeed fun, but they were also fun in Arkham city(I would acually say that they were both better in Arkham city), and they have not really been changed at all since then. Overall the gameplay is nearly identical to Arkham city. Everything that worked there, also works quite well here.They did add few neat things, but I was hoping for more. And yeah, there is that multiplayer mode....that nobody really wanted to see. There are also a lot of glicthes in the game, some are small and some are serious issues. The game does also crash quite often.\n\nBut anyway, what about the story? Well the joker has a big role in it...again. The joker is a great character, but could you give the spotlight to someone else please, he already had a huge role in 2 games! There is also that 8 assassin's hire by Black mask thing, which doesn't really get as much attention as I hoped. The boss fights that they were bragging on about are not even that special. Some of them are quite good, and some are the quite bad.\n\nA lot of people were ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off because Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroiy are not in the game, but those new voice actors for Batman and the joker both do a good job, so no need to worry about that. But overall the story and characters are all quite good. I would even say that the story, might be the best in the series. The problem is that it lacks tension, because it's a prequel.\n\nAh whatever, I think that I have said all that there is to say.Even though Arkham origins is quite clearly the weakest part of the series, I still had some fun playing it, but I was left hoping for much more.So what is my final verdict? In it's current state, I simply can't give this game a higher score than 6,5 out of 10. I may have given it a 7 if it wasn't SO glitchy, but it's a little late for that now...","October 29, 2013","true","43.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Although the PC version is still a little buggy. Not buggy enough to ruin the game for me, but I would never even attempt the "I am the night" mode because of the bugs. Also, this game slightly lacks the  attention to detail that the other Arkham games had. i.e. some steam vents can't be plugged with a glue grenade while others can etc. Also, the combat system timing is a little off. Sometimes, quickfire gadgets don't work. I have to jump a couple times to get them working again.\n\nNot at all game breaking, but still knocked off a couple points for me.\n\n7/10\n\nUPDATED: 04-23-2014\n\nCold, Cold Heart DLC:\n\nSome people have been playing this and have reported bugs. I played this and did not encounter a single bug or visual glitch. This was more stable than the original game. It is fun and story driven. The new thermal suit is a little funny looking, but is still quite fun. This DLC is about the same length as Harley Quinn's revenge, from Arkham City. You can beat it in about 1-2 hours depending on how much of the side missions that you complete. It's nice to play a DLC that is more than just a new costume or map.

This is a real pain in the butt if you completed the story line. I even had to play the I Am The Night mode (you die, you start all over again) for completing this rank.\n- The same condition of "finishing the ranks just during the story" make the "challenge maps" unatractive. And besides, you just get achievements if you get ALL of the medals. I mean, c'mon! at least give me an achievement for getting almost all of them!\n- Sometimes (not often, but it happened to me a couple of times) bugs will make you restart to the last checkpoint. As an example, I was fighting the last boss, and suddenly Batman and the boss stopped moving and just stared at each other... It was kinda funny, thou.\n\nSaid this, let's go to everything I totally loved:\n-The whole story is something amazing! whorty of any comic book!. I would go into details, but I don't want to spoil anything. I just loved it so much that playing the normal, new game plus, and I am the night mode was a total pleasure. The only "but" is that I consider it to be too short, compared with Arkham City, but it is compensated by the many side stories that are allowed by the Most Wanted missions.\n- You gotta love Barbara Gordon <3\n- I do think this game makes the Batman to be more a detective than the previous games, which is a very fun thing to play. It's kinda easy thou, since the Batman does everything for you.\n- If you can, buy the DLC Cold, Cold Heart. The way they explain the origins of Mr. Freeze is stunning!\n- The gameplay is, as always, something intuitive. I played Arkham City like... two years ago? and now I just graved the PS3 controller (yes, **** you, Microsoft!) and it was like riding a bike... people don't forget!\n- Getting all the collectibles, all the upgrades, all the tags, everything, will give you lots and lots of hours of gameplay. I did reach 100 hours of gaming just with the singleplayer mode (my brother also played the game, so, I didn't actualy play that amount of time). I might have taken my time, thou, I'm sure you can do it faster.\n\nAbout the price, yes, 30 dollars for all the time I played is worthy, but yet, that amount of money for just one game is kinda too much for me. I got this game during the Summer Sales, and those 7.5 USD I did spend for this game are one of the best buying I have ever made. But, If you're ok about paying 30 USD for one game, I'm telling you, DO IT!! you wont regret!.\n\nI can't really talk about the multiplayer mode. I'm not too much into playing online, then I just tried it for a while. It was fun.\n\nSummary: GO FOR IT!","July 25, 2014","true","107.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now you might be asking yourself: lol is dis duud on meth or sumting. Well, actually you might think that I'm gonna say some logical reason for making such a statement(not the meth thing). So le't get down to it.\n\nThe fighting and stealth are both still really fun. So what is the problem? Well the problem is that they are indeed fun, but they were also fun in Arkham city(I would acually say that they were both better in Arkham city), and they have not really been changed at all since then. Overall the gameplay is nearly identical to Arkham city. Everything that worked there, also works quite well here.They did add few neat things, but I was hoping for more. And yeah, there is that multiplayer mode....that nobody really wanted to see. There are also a lot of glicthes in the game, some are small and some are serious issues. The game does also crash quite often.\n\nBut anyway, what about the story? Well the joker has a big role in it...again. The joker is a great character, but could you give the spotlight to someone else please, he already had a huge role in 2 games! There is also that 8 assassin's hire by Black mask thing, which doesn't really get as much attention as I hoped. The boss fights that they were bragging on about are not even that special. Some of them are quite good, and some are the quite bad.\n\nA lot of people were ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off because Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroiy are not in the game, but those new voice actors for Batman and the joker both do a good job, so no need to worry about that. But overall the story and characters are all quite good. I would even say that the story, might be the best in the series. The problem is that it lacks tension, because it's a prequel.\n\nAh whatever, I think that I have said all that there is to say.Even though Arkham origins is quite clearly the weakest part of the series, I still had some fun playing it, but I was left hoping for much more.So what is my final verdict? In it's current state, I simply can't give this game a higher score than 6,5 out of 10. I may have given it a 7 if it wasn't SO glitchy, but it's a little late for that now...","October 29, 2013","true","43.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Bigger world, a great story, great combat system with other gadgets and enemies type. The game is harder, enemies attack more frequently (it gets annoying sometimes, but most of the times, you just have to time it, I know it's hard to not start striking but... well, countering is important, too! But don't worry, you'll get your chance). The story was really great (yes, I'm saying it again). Improvements? Especially the boss fights, most boss fights were enjoyable and unique. (I still hate Riddler / Enigma for making us go around collecting collectibles).\n\nIn Short once more: The game was extremely satisfying, I'll wait for the next game once again!

This one is developed by a different studio and suffers from some bugs, story issues and general feel of "same-iness" but it's still an enjoyable experience.\n\nIt's in the vain of a 3D "Metroidvania": You explore a vast world, getting upgrades that allow you to reach previously inaccessible areas. Traversing through that world you encounter countless thugs that you beat up in a very satisfying free-flow combat experience, or take them out one by one using stealth, in the "predator"-style encounters.

I was somewhat impressed. Mainly story wise, although it's done so many times.\n\nThis game would of been better for the first game of the series, introducing players to Batman who're new to whole story of Batman.\n(Origins > Asylum > City) that's the order it is in timeline instead of being some LotD/Star Wars releases, but that is just a minor complaint that obviously can't be dealt with.\n\n-Combat-\nThe combat was the same old thing, but that isn't always a bad thing, I like to speed through gameplay and enjoy story as much as I could and with Batman games, it goes too well if you max out armour/shock gloves in Origins(same with previous games aswell) combat armour is pretty much the Jesus items of the games. The animations for some of the fighting scenes/gameplay was amazing though. 7/10\n\n-Stealth-\nStealth parts of the game hardly happened as much (probably because I stormed in with combat armour) but there wasn't enough compared to Asylum, which was disappointment, simply because it doesn't make you feel like Batman against thugs, with the thugs, you're supposed to be intimidating, surprising and bringing fear to them. So it was quite a shame not being able to feel like side of Batman most of the time. 6/10\n\n-Boss Battles-\nBoss battles was great as it showed a lot of different pieces of combat combinations. You was introduced to 8 different types of fighters, notably Firefly, a mix of using items and taking him down, Copperhead with using shadow clone jutsu and posion and Deathstroke was personally my favourite as it took me a lot of tries to defeat him, because of those time events and counters to get right. Bane was also a ♥♥♥♥♥, not going down until like the end of the game.\n\n-Story-\n\nOh boy here we go. The actual story, was pretty good, nothing amazing, it's been done before with the main story of Batman and Joker, and thats what really bugs me, as its always focused on them two? We've had THREE games based on those two, it gets old really fast, but  because Joker is dead after City, by the game lore it makes you wonder who the main villian will be.\n\nBesides the whole Joker and Batman ship, every other character in the game was imense, Bane mainly, but I am biased as he's my favourite but besides that, I'm happy with the story, and the overall outlook on the game, I still have to try the online features.\n\nTENOUTATEN\n\nIf you enjoy Batman, and can deal with a few nitpicking, this game is for you. :)","July 8, 2014","true","18.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

In fact, the circumstances of Wayne's childhood tragedy, training, and return to Gotham as reborn vigilante is already in the past, before the game begins, and he is already equipped with batarangs, grapnel, and Batwing jet. Instead, the 'Origins' referenced are the seeds planted in the story that will eventually mature into the Arkham City future. Along the way, Batman grows from a shadowy rumor to a renowned crime-fighter, having already taken bites out of local threats like Penguin and Black Mask, but also starting to attract enough attention to himself to begin to tip the established balance of power that will change Gotham forever.\n\nUnfortunately, where the previous Arkham Games have built and expanded on the fantasy of 'becoming' the Batman and living his adventure, with his gadgets, intelligence, and fortitude, Origins deviates very little from the City forumla of roaming the night, dealing justice to criminals, solving crime, and saving the city from an overarching threat. There's nothing new here, which is probably good news if you enjoyed City, but will disappoint if you're looking for the Arkham franchise to raise the ante. In a very real sense, Origins is a sort of deluxe-sized expansion pack for Arkham City that transposes that sequel's gameplay back in time.\n\nThe good is that the polish and production values are as high as ever. The animation, cinematics, voice acting, and so on are extremely immersive, and Gotham looks great as a proud, post-industrial metropolis beginning to decay from the inside out. All of Batman's gadgets return, and there are now even more districts to explore, with never a shortage of thugs to beat into unconsciousness. There is a full compliment of challenge maps to medal in, side quests to complete, and obscure objects to find and collect, as in City. The main addition to the Arkham series overall is the "Crime Scene" sequences where Batman explores and reconstructs various crimes in order to solve a problem. While these are very, very simple puzzles, the actions and narrations do give the player a solid sense of being the "World's Greatest Detective", which is often neglected in Batman movies and games.\n\nThe bad is that it will feel very much like playing Arkham City all over again, in a more mundane environment, and with a story campaign that feels noticably shorter when you consider it apart from all the diversions that you might explore along the way. Batman gains new abilities by completing various challenges according to the Dark Knight system, but what might have been enjoyable can easily become a frustrating grind when the challenge requirements do not properly align with the actual given opportunities within the game, forcing you to replay the game over if you want to maximize your potential. Lastly, this is clearly the least stable, most buggy iteration of the Arkham franchise. While most of the issues have been resolved by now, the game does not seem to have been coded cleanly or elegantly. Expect to experience crashes along the way.\n\nConcerning the DLC: The Initiation Pack only features Challenge Map content, which is a good value if you like that gamplay (I do). You can play pre-Batman Bruce Wayne in a weaker, stripped-down form on all the standard maps, along with a difficult, 5-map campaign simulating his training as part of the League of Shadows. Conversely, the "Cold Cold Heart" DLC is a standalone, story-only campaign, with no challenge maps, that doesn't interact with the main Origins storyline at all. If you just like the Batman story and experience without the tedium of Challenge medals, then this is perfect content for you, featuring a complete set of side quests, equipment upgrades, open-world exploring, and plotline with new enemies and characters, and a challenging new boss fight integrating stealth, combat, and gadgets together. As for the Batman costume skin packs, I didn't find them ultimately worth the value. The various suits and costumes generally did not fit well into the strong, well-established artistic design the game already possesses, and were at best comical and at worst distracting.\n\nIn summary, Arkham Origins is retelling stories you have probably already heard before. If once was enough, you should probably take a pass, but if you can't just get enough, Origins is happy to offer more.\n","April 26, 2014","true","153.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've enojoyed my time with Arkham Origins not only because of the differences it had from Asylum and City but because of its dark atmosphere. The boss fights (excluding Bane) weren't constanly being drawn out with "Venom" and there were less chores to do all around. Asylum didn't have this problem but with City I saw every villian as an annoyance whereas Origins' villians threatened something I cared about. The end of this game wasn't a bulky boss fight but more so an outlet for you to taste revenge and release Batman's anger.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/recommended/209000/","CPTMOISTPANTIES","Cpt. Moist Panties","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/","261 products in account","Being a prequel to the Arkham franchise, the game stars a younger Bruce Wayne trying to find solid footing as the Bat. This comes through in his interactions with criminals: he's much fiercer and almost homicidal in tone and actions. He lacks the distinct calm that he perpetually exudes; his actions are brasher and more impulsive. Although Batman supposedly never kills, he comes damn close in this game due to his rage, which has obviously settled in later titles. His anger is subliminally hidden in his tone of voice and the excessive use of force in cut scenes when giving beat-downs, so you might miss it if you don't understand that Batman is supposed to be calm, meticulous, and in control of his emotions.\n\nThe problem is that this is the only shot of Batman's inexperience for 60% of the game. Towards the end of the title you get a substantially larger view at a young Batman's doubts and worries. For almost half the game there is absolutely nothing to point at Batman's inexperience, nothing to tell you that he is just starting out as Gotham's knight. There's his anger, and it was done in a sublime manner, but given that there's suddenly an entire game's worth of development at the end you end up wondering what the ♥♥♥♥ you were doing for the first half. Suddenly Alfred is yelling at Batman for being reckless; Batman is having doubts about his effectiveness at saving his city; the gamer delves into the Joker's psychological profile. Yet half the game you're just doing some boring ♥♥♥ shit that doesn't amount to the development in character and story that we get at the end.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the much hyped 'assassins'. They're introduced at the beginning and made to look as if they will be a significant element to the plot, but what you get is random drop-ins from people along your investigation. The drop-ins aren't even all that good: One guy you never fight, two are optional and are forgettable, and one fight is a golrified QTE where the only inputs needed are ''Attack'' and ''Counter''. The fight with the 8th assassin doesn't even make sense, as the bounty on your head (which they are all after) is completely gone. There must have been a better way to integrate the assassins into the main storyline. As it stands they seem to be an afterthought conjured up to give you a boss fight every few hours. And the boss fight's aren't even all that interesting.\n\n'Gameplay'-wise the-ahahahahahahahaha. Why bother talking about game mechanics: it's exactly the same as the other titles. There is absolutely nothing different here, other than akward pacing. You get all of the same weapons and moves, with a few new ones that all wind up being more or less useless save for two or three. Hell, they imported Arkham City into this game, with the only addition to the overworld being a long bridge that leads to a new section of Gotham to mess around in. Granted, it's not the SAME exact area as before, as they had to downsize it to create new areas, but it's still pretty familiar territory. I'd argue that it was a change for the worse, as one of the shinning aspects of Arkham City was the character that each area had, signifying the leader of the place. That's gone, and now it's just gothic architecture.\n\nRiddler is still there, but the quality of the trophy placement has degraded. Just like in the last title there are a bunch of trophies scattered throughout, this time in the form of 'data packs'. The odd thing is that you can actually solve a LOT of these from the very beginning, so it all feels underwhelming. That and the fact that some of them are just out in the open, waiting to be grabbed.\n\nThere are no Riddles for you to solve this time around, sadly. That means that you don't get the Batman references throughout the world, waiting to be scanned. Which means that the overworld feels more barren, because instead of:\n\n-Harvey Dent's office in a corner\n-Catwoman's home to the side of a building with graffitti sprayed on the wall\n-a movie poster referencing a shape-shifting villain\n-a jailcell with calendars strewn about in a peculiar manner\n-a casino with a cool, Greek looking neon sign referencing a villain\n\nyou get:\n\n-an office building\n-an apartment building\n-a movie poster\n-regular looking jail cell after jail cell\n-a generic casino\n\nPeople need to understand that one of the cool things about the Arkham titles was the amount of references they tried putting into the games in the environment, which means that you got a really unique looking world with character instead of blank building after blank building. I don't even read Batman comics, but everytime I saw something unique in the overworld, which was almost always, I would scan it cause it stood out enough for me to wonder what it was. Now it's just gothic architecture that looks nice. Instead of Riddler's Riddles you get some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ 'Anarky' tags, that are just leftist socialist dribble about the banks. I read four of those tags. Four. When he got to ♥♥♥♥ing collectivism I was like ''oh God I can't stand the ♥♥♥♥er I'm not gonna read any more of this propaganda'. Cause it's propaganda. I know for a ♥♥♥♥ing fact that some writer was typing it all up, assured that he would 'enlighten' the masses reading his garbage. Also, the villain behind the tags winds up being some 'Anonymous' inspired ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who goes on a LONG ♥♥♥♥ING SPEECH after you beat him. He's just really annoying, really political, and really really gay.\n\nTL;DR it's like all the other games with nothing new to offer. The one thing it could have done, which was a showcase of a younger Batman, wasn't present for over half the title. When it emerges it doesn't save this from still being an otherwise plain affair. Something tells me to hit the 'no' button in the recommendation, but it's still an alright game. It's just a disappointment. Also, it wasn't made by Rocksteady, so that might explain why it doesn't try anything new. This is like a half-♥♥♥♥♥ game released before the REAL sequel to Arkham City: Arkham Knight.\n\nAnd yes, I focus on a lot of the bad in the review and yet still recommend it. Mainly because despite it's flaws, I'm not regretting the purchase and it was like a C+ summer film: I could've spent my money watching a better movie, but I don't regret the experience and am fine with it.","July 3, 2014","true","57.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

The whole Arkham Origins kind of was. Love the Batman franchise though. And most of this would sort of be nitpicking, but it's the little things right?\n\n\n1. Yes I know, he's a "hero". But still, the game taunts you by giving you all these lovely rooftops, and yet you cannot throw people off? Or at the least, hang them from the railings like he does in numerous torture scenes? I mean, the enemy, on the edge of a building, I kick him straight back and he just goes up in the air like he's too good to fall off!\n\n2. If you are giving me the "counter" symbol, and I press the button, it was because I wanted to counter.\n\n3. Gotham is a beautiful city right? I'd like to go to one of their lovely bars and knock a few drunk heads around or something.\n\n4. I know I know, he's afraid of firearms. But still, it would be nice to be able to use say, a tranquilizer gun, or a at least shoot one of the thugs in the knee. I mean if you're allowed to beat them to a bloody pulp with their own skulls, a bullet to the knee sounds like a much nicer way to take someone down if you ask me.\n\n5. The game just starts to become quite repetative quite quickly. The only real difference is WHERE you repeat it. And it's not just the Bat Man games. It's ALL superhero games. Go here, mash the button until conflict is resolved. Attempt stealth but hope to hell it doesn't glitch out on you.\n\n6. Those ♥♥♥♥ing vent covers! I'm sick of having to mash the A button everytime I come across one of those. I mean seriously! What are they, trying to build up our thumb muscles or something? Just play the cutscene, and stop this useless crap.\n\n7. Again, Gotham is a beautiful city. I'd love to be able to jump and run around it all over the place. But the fact that I cannot for the life of me grapple up a simple ledge for some reason baffles me. "Oh but errr you're not supposed to go derrrrr". Well perhaps make it a little bit more obvious with say, a fence or something. Don't give me the hope that I MAY be able to get up there.\n\n8. The Puzzles: Ok, I'll admit, that one where you have to do a whole bunch of forensics is fun. It makes me feel immersed in the whole "detective" role. But when you have to use your little thumb stick to aim at a circle and press one button? I mean, cmon. That's not a puzzle, it's an inconvinence. A break from the gameplay that disrupts the flow and pacing. It's just as bad as the "mash A to open" button.\n\n9. This game is hard just for all the wrong reasons. It's not a challange in itself, it's just buggy and clunky. The controls skips if they even work at all.\n\n10. Instant Respawn Enemies: Ok so I've just spent the last 15 minutes cleaerning a ship full of badguys to make a stealth entrance, only to have walked to the other side of the ship and back, and they already set up shop straight away!\n\n11: Ok I need to know if this "supposed" stealth move is going to be quiet or not. Thanks to not knowing, I now have to redo the whole ♥♥♥♥ing scene again. Yeah, thanks.\n\n12: Bad prioritisation of targets: Don't get me wrong, it's fun to just randomly mash a button and hope for the best. However, if there is a room full of fist wielding thugs, and a man with a machine gun, I'd PROBABLY go for the machine gun first, if that's ok with you.","March 1, 2014","false","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The setting should be familiar to fans of the series. What won't be familiar, however, are the bugs. I ran into a progression-blocking bug and dedcided to wait for it to be patched, until the devs said that they may or may not release bug fixing patches. However, they're still going to release paid DLC. I'm done with this game and I'm sure as hell done with this dev after just one purchase.\nStrongly recommend avoiding it. Asylum has such an amazing story and City is great in its own right, and I'm sure this game is pretty decent too, but I can't bring myself to support it in any way.","February 28, 2014","false","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This time , however, Rocksteady studio is not in charge of development. This episode was made vy Warner Brothers Montreal , and the multiplayer mode was created by studio Splash Damage. Acquisition of rights for Batman by other studios made me a little concerned. Batman games have become one of the best games of all time for me. That's why I was not able to understand why the development was given to another team.\nWhen we start, the game greets us with about 40 seconds of videos presenting companies that was involved in making this product. You can not skip them of course , but you can disable it by adding the command in the steam launch options. This does not change the fact that for the average player videos will be very annoying. Game options are quite extensive and certainly I can not complain about the lack of customization , the only thing I lacked in this section is the lack of key mapping for quick use of gadget. I personally liked to set it to use under the separate button , but somehow I can get over the double keystrokes gadgets.\nGraphically the game looks solid, although really little has changed on this issue since Batman Arkham City . But when we play longer we can notice a lot of glitchy graphics. Cloak often decides to ignore the laws of physics and perform odd stunts. Batman apparently got used to this state of affairs, because it absolutely does not impress him. However, the most drastic visual mistake for which I came across is gliding. Quite often when we fly Batman can't decide whether he is gliding or landing and begins to hop up and down on the screen.\nCombat mechanics are solid as usual , however, almost nothing new was added. The only variety that have been changed ( not even added) is gadgets. Background music is as always spectacular and well fits the atmosphere of Arkham.\nBut how the game's storyline, look? In contrast to the previous titles , this title wanted to show us an inexperienced Batman , who just starts on his way to fight crime. So how Batman shows his inexperience? Here lies a problem. Batman is the same as always, we cannot see that he just started his career. There's not many inserts that tell us about it . At the beginning the villains do not believe in the existence of Batman, but after playing 30 minutes of gameplay they all definitely know the Human Bat is real. Amazingly Batman made earlier his Batwing than the Batmobile, which still lies in scraps in his bat cave. Once we're about two hours into the game, Batman shows his lack of experience when one of the criminals escapes after being knocked down and not tied by Batman. In my opinion, developers didn't use all the opportunities of Batman being in the beginning of his career.\nWell everything , though perhaps less polished, was in the previous parts. In this game , however, there is added multiplayer mode. In multiplayer we have a chance to play one of the subordinates of Joker or Bane, as well as Batman or Robin. Both criminals factions are fighting each other by taking control of places that allow them to earn domination points. The team that accumulates more points wins the match. All the time during this struggle they must also think about Batman and Robin who have the task to stop the criminals. Team Batman wins when bar of terror is filed, and they earn it by doing more and more interesting knockouts, and eliminating team captains. For a long time there was no asymmetrical multiplayer game and I must admit that it is made very well in this one. But the problem arises when someone has a poor internet connection. During my battles in multiplayer very often I've seen players teleporting all around the screen, and some looked like their game just freezed.\nOverall, the game is very nice but does not seem as solidly polished as the previous parts of Batman. After all, the announcement of the new DLC before the solution of technical problems with the game, left me a big disgust . Multiplayer is very nice as far as opponents do not teleport on the the screen. If you are not tired of the previous parts of Batman you can go ahead and reach for the title, although I would wait until all the problems that the game has are fixed. Which apparently will never be fixed. On official forums WB montreal's community manager wrote that they are not planing to fix any more bugs that aren't blocking player from finishing the game, cause they are busy working on new DLC for batman. Just for that reason I would say that you shouldn't buy this product. It's really sad how impudent this developer is.\n\n","February 16, 2014","false","28.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was and am a HUGE Batman Arkham Series fan. I really loved the dark atmosphere and challenge (on hard) of the first game and the high replayability of the second game. With that said, this game in no way pushes the series forward. The raved about boss fights are lazy. This game completely exhausted the combat system (believe or not) and then compounds that with repetitious uninspired stun/beatdown boss fights. The story was also weak and spent way too long to show itself different or new. I found myself (a Batman fan!) getting more and more cynical as I played. I have about 25% of the main story left and I'm not even the slightest interested in how things turn out. (6/10)\n\nPS: For an inspired boss reference, I think Poison Ivy with Catwoman, Killer Croc in BAA, Mr. Freeze, Solomon Grundy, and even Bane in BAA were inspiring boss fights.\n\nUPDATE: I have now completed this game (after some reluctance) and the final fight is just about the ONLY inspird boss fight I've found in this game.","February 13, 2014","false","17.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I noticed that it got very negative review and i thought i would write my review to clear some things up.\n\nFirst of all Arkham Origins is not trying to do something new or redo a major part of the game and for a good reason if WB Montreal had added something new or redid something Rockstedy put in place they would have been blamed by fans for messing up what Rockstedy had created.\n\nFirst of all the story it's really good. The first two Arkham games had an okay story but it wasn't a story i really connected with i mostly finished the game and that was that. Arkham Origins on the other hand has a story that keeps you on your toes wondering whats going to happen next. In my opinion it's way better than the past Arkham games.\n\nOne of the biggest things Origins got blamed for was the difficulty but i personally like the challenge. The first two Arkham games always felt to easy i went through them really quickly and after that it was over. Origins adds to the challenge and might have overdone it the game could be argued overly hard but once you get the hang of it it becomes pretty easy.\n\nThe boss battles are much more interesting take the firefly battle for example avoiding fire while a bridge was falling apart was really enjoyable. The boss battles also gave me something new a feeling of satisfaction when you defeat a boss. This was never really in the Arkham games.\n\nMy favorite part of the game was the Multiplayer it adds a whole new aspect of the game and can be pretty scary. You really feel what the criminals you encounter feel as you see something swoop past you and then take you out from behind. The bane and joker games are your average 3rd person shooter but playing as Batman or Robin is really fun.\n\nWhile the game may not have added much it delivers in one category making an excellent Arkham game.\n\nall in all I rate this game\n\n7/10 it had some major glitches that should have been fixed.","January 26, 2014","true","77.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It plays fine, the story is not bad. There are times where the game will show glitches, such as Batman falling THROUGH THE GROUND, or landing in water when he should be landing on the ground. Those, quite frankly, shouldn't bother anyone too much as they aren't too bad. Now, I am not too familiar with all the glitches, however I can tell you: STAY AWAY FROM 'MY ALIBI'.\n\nAfter you fight Bane, there will be a prompt to go after someone called The Bird. There are three places you travel to in order to complete the mission. The last place is 'My Alibi.' When I played it, I did the mini-boss fight with The Bird, then I was able to walk around. I walked into an adjacent room which turned black, as if I were between layers. Then I tried to leave the building but got stuck, so I restarted the game. When I continued the game, I saw Batman stuck in limbo, completely rendering the game broken. I've checked around and I see that it is a common glitch that occurs.\n\nI have only had this game for about a month, so whatever updates occured to fix this problem never carried over to when I bought it. I'm recommending this game because as I have said, it is fine and most of the glitches aren't too bad. All you need to do though, to be safe, is to completely avoid going into 'My Alibi.'","April 19, 2014","true","28.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It stayed true to the combat and stealth priniciples from the previous games. The places where the game tried to expand the franchises didn't fare as well, like investigating crimes through Detective Mode, however this was not to the detrement of the game overall. I like how the game used the origin story to explore Batman's relationship withe The Joker.

I must say that although the game is great, it is no match to what Arkham City had. The story was great, loved the part with the refrences to the Killing Joke and Joker's origin. However, what really began to tick me off was the combat, it was much slower and not as fluid. I found myself having the slow down, which is not a good thing when facing fifteen people at once. The only way I could take down some of the later battles were the shock gloves, which were way too overpowered in my opinion. The younger Bruce Wayne does actually feel younger, he seems more arrogant and less experienced, and I loved having Alfred talk to me rather than Oracle for a change. This is not just Batman's story though, it is also a story about the Joker, whom I found intriguing. The new voice actors suprisingly fit well, but nobody can beat Kevin Conroy. Gotham City seems really like a cut and paste Arkahm City, but it has some new tricks up its sleeve. Overall, even though this game is probably the weakest in the series, it's really well done. I'm suprised it was good, as it was not Rocksteady who made this game, but WB Montreal.\n\n8.4/10","March 31, 2014","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This entry, by WB Games Montreal, is sort of like a Year Two Batman story, which immediately raises any number of questions. First, because it's clear that Jim Gordon and Batman have very little history together at this point, it's not a tale that directly follows Frank Miller's Year One. Second it's not really an origin story of anything: Batman has already been operating for some time and Arkham Asylum, as a facility that is distinct and separate from Blackgate Prison, on the other hand, does not exist at all. This is, however, very much a WB Batman game, as the new developer takes Rocksteady's work and makes no substantial alterations beyond telling a different story. For good or ill, this is indeed your father's Batman game.\n\nThe game begins on Christmas Eve with Batman going after Black Mask, who has apparently put a bounty of $50 million on his head, and this has attracted some of the most dangerous assassins in the world to Gotham. Because this is early in Batman's career he does some dumb things like forgetting his razor and neglecting to secure a subdued "super"villain (the ridiculously-named and ill-fated Electrocutioner); additionally, half of Gotham isn't convinced that he's real and most of the police force is out to try to arrest him or put him six feet under (compare this to the deferential treatment he receives in the opening cutscene of Arkham Asylum). Also, there are quite a few other things going on during this particular December 24: a certain Mr. E Nigma hijacks Batman's navigation towers and leaves blackmail files around the city; Anarky has planted bombs on major landmarks; and the Mad Hatter does his best Jonathan Crane impression. The entirety of the main story's action takes place during this single evening so it's a very busy night for the Bat.\n\nThe main elements of the previous games return here: the free-flow combat, unlocking a succession of Bat-gadgets, side missions and collectibles. The only new facets to the game are the Team Fortress-like multiplayer, the fast-travel system needed to traverse the much-larger bit of real estate that is Gotham City, and the training simulator (although this is basically a reworking of the combat and stealth room challenges from the previous games, which are also present).\n\nMultiplayer is disappointing, in some measure because it's never been a strong suit of mine in any game, but also because it's the first time I've ever felt like a 95-lb. weakling when playing as Batman in a game. Players are randomly assigned to teams of criminals with two random players being selected to play as Batman and Robin. The regular criminal types are loaded to the gills with gear that ensures that simply lying in wait as if you were playing a predator challenge as Batman is not a viable option, as you will quickly be spotted and shot. There is also the possibility of the gang leaders, Bane and Joker, turning up during a match. Matches are won by holding control points in the case of criminals or filling an intimidation meter (by taking out criminals) when playing as the Dynamic Duo. It's all bog-standard stuff, in other words, and not something I was too interested in spending much time on.\n\nDisappointingly, this and the challenge maps are the only places where one can utilize the various DLC costumes available. I'm not sure why this is. The official explanation had something to do with cutscenes being pre-rendered in such as way that the use of alternate Batman skins is not an option, but this is evidently a limitation of the engine being utilized by WB Montreal because Rocksteady released a code that allowed anyone to use unlocked DLC skins at any time during Arkham City's story.\n\nThe story mode action, then, is very familiar to players of previous Arkham games. Is this an inherently bad thing? Not really. If you liked the Rocksteady games, you'll probably like this one, because it is largely more of the same.\n\nSeveral odd design decisions occurred with the production of this game, which will affect your experience but not in a terribly detrimental way. For whatever reasons the corporate gods determined, Warner had Montreal working on this while Rocksteady was quietly and concurrently (it would seem) creating Arkham Knight in secret. Where the latter sees the return of fan-favorite Kevin Conroy as the voice of Batman, WB opted to go with a different voice cast for the roles of Batman, The Joker, and Harley Quinn in Arkham Origins. This is somewhat distracting at first, but the Origins cast do well enough in their respective roles. Troy Baker, in particular, is quite good as The Joker, which is a bit of a relief because Mark Hamill is probably done with the part for good. The number of Riddler collectibles was halved from Arkham City's absurd 400 to a more manageable 200. While some reviewers have said the freeflow combat doesn't feel as "tight" in this entry, I can't really say that I've noticed a difference; on the other hand, I'll be the first to concede that I'm not exactly a freeflow-combat master.\n\nThere are a lot of goofy aspects to the unfolding narrative here. While Arkham City presented us with the bizarre notion that an entire area encompassing dozens of city blocks would be cordoned off as a kind of "death zone" substitute for an actual penitentiary, I've come to realize that this could either be viewed as something presented in a realistic fashion (in which case it is kinda batshit crazy) or as a Swiftian satire on the phenomena of white flight, the "war on drugs" and an increasing reliance on the expansion of prisons in a society where the percentage of the population that is incarcerated seems to be growing exponentially. In either case, it would make sense that there would be no ordinary citizens on the streets of such an Escape from New York-style dystopian penal zone. Here the only explanation provided for this incongruous phenomenon is that police have warned people to stay off the streets. At various points in the game, we're introduced to Batman and Alfred's insanely-fantastic analytical equipment, which can produce antivenoms to unknown neurotoxins in a matter of minutes and provide DNA matches from bodily fluids at a crime scene with equal celerity. The crowning absurdity has to be the game's naive proposal that any kind of high-voltage equipment can be used as an effective defibrillator; in fairness, this is the sort of thing that one tends to see on television on an almost weekly basis, but this doesn't make it any less nonsensical.\n\nThe main story will take you around 30-35 hours to knock out and you can count on an extra 10-15 hours getting the collectibles and beating challenge maps. Annoyingly, the "Initiation" DLC is itself just a series of challenge maps rather than being a full-fledged story prologue. "Cold Cold Heart," however, does consist of a new story, a somewhat-rehashed origin tale of classic Bat-villain, Mr. Freeze. Outside of the wintry tale, there are a few new things to do, such as finding new Anarky tags and unfreezing cops and security guards. For a completionist, the Mr. Freeze DLC will take about another 7 hours, and it's well worth a few bucks, but I wouldn't buy it at the current full asking price of $10.","April 26, 2014","true","55.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unfortunately, it still appears that it has some game-breaking glitches, despite the patches put out when the major ones were made a known issue in Nov. 2013.\n\nThe gameplay itself is pretty much the same as the last two installments in the batman series (Arkham: Asylum and City).   Bats glides, beats-up to string combos and special beatdowns, sneaks around in predator encounters (vent, grate, hanging takedowns are the same)  etc etc.\nPersonally I found it different in the overall feel of the game.  The previous installements seemed to pay much more homage to the comic book character's canon and story, with little touches  such as references to classic or obscure batman villains.  Arkham Origins is the beginning of Batman's career, so granted he hasn't encountered as many in this story line, but I would have preferred some of that love of the actual comic flavor as in the previous (for example: Bane is rocking what sounds to be an attempt at some Eastern European accent, despite being from Santa Presca).  Instead with Origins, we are given a storyline that only barely jives with the continuity of the previous games and gameplay that feels much more   of a beat 'em up and less of a love-letter to the batman franchise.\n\nAs to the glitches, about 56hrs into the game (and gathering every collectible possible) I experienced a clipping glitch where batman fell through the map.  Because the game has auto-save and it unfortunately saved during this, I could not load to before that. Unfortunately, it looks like I will have to restart the game.","April 5, 2014","true","151.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's no Arkham Asylum or Arkham City.\n\nSet just two years after Bruce Wayne becomes Batman, the game has our caped crusader still as yet unknown, a myth amongst criminals and a wanted man by Gotham City PD. Bruce is on his own, and Origins explores how Batman becomes protector of Gotham.\n\nLet's start off with the bad. There are a HUGE amount of horrific bugs and control issues that really hamper the game, including a few game breaking ones. Combat flows awkwardly and haphazardly, with serious AI issues abounding all throughout. Often the gadgets can stop working, and many times it's not always clear where to go next. However, YMMV in these areas, so take that with a grain of salt.\n\nThat being said, there are flashes of pure unadulterated brilliance in Origins. The story is AMAZING, and I would put it superior to both Asylum and City, even if they played it a bit safe with the ending. Fights with Deathstroke, Deadshot (♥♥♥♥ that fight) and even Firefly are great to see and pulled off nicely. Deathstroke's fight is absolutely brilliant, requiring strategy and constant awareness to do flawlessly.\n\nThe game looks very nice, even on my middle-range system. I can only imagine what a beastly rig would make this game look like. Environments however are a little bland. Would have liked to see more greenery, but the setting of the game at Christmas does explain away that omission.\n\nOverall, while not as tight mechanically as Asylum, or City, Origins is worth your time. A great imagining of a Batman not yet a recognisable hero, but still a threat to the criminals of Gotham.\n\nRating: 3.5/5\n\nWarner Brothers has no intention of patching bugs that don't break the game, so be aware that some issues can and most likely will arise while playing.","April 7, 2014","true","86.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is no where near the level of Batman Arkham Asylum and City. Both are amazing games and should be played to fully enjoy the series. This one however feels like a DLC.\nThe good part about this 'dlc' is that it goes back to show the story before the events of Arkahm Asylum. Aside from that and few new gadgets, the entire game looks and feels like a copy-paste of previous installments. This one even comes with occasional glitches that I've never encoutered in the other twos.\n\nIf you've played the first two games, play it as a "steam sale, gotta have it" style game. It will expand the story a bit.\n\nOn the positive sides however, the game does introduce some amazing mechanics, most notably the detective-simulation type system to investigate a crime scene. Hopefully in the next TRUE Batman game, it will be implemented with better, improved, and complex elements.\n\nI recommend this as a good buy, but it is not to be compared to the first two games.","April 6, 2014","true","18.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ramsden/recommended/209000/","ramsden","Insidia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ramsden/","309 products in account","When hearing we were getting a new Batman from a different studio I got a little nervous; in my opinion Arkham Asylum and Arkham City were both ground breaking and quite rightly very successful. During a number of discussions with friends over this game it has generally been; just how can you improve on a solid enough gaming engine in the first place? You could possibly only really add to what has been an almost perfect series so far.\n\nThe story itself is set ten years before the story of Arkham Asylum and you run into all the familiars, joker riddles, other things to scan and collect to get the achievement, xp and upgrade etc.Having played the first two you knew that these things were going to be included again at the very least. So I won't rant about "same old the other two" because quite honestly if I was expecting anything different on that part I’d have been expecting a completely different and revamped game altogether. If you love the first two games then this shouldn't really be an issue nor a surprise.\n\nGraphics:\n\nGraphics are pretty solid, you get some nice camera angle action shots as before. I wouldn't say there is an amazing improvement but you should know what you’re paying for anyway. If you have a half decent graphics card (I only run mine on a gtx 670) then you'll have the same enjoyment as you did on the previous two. For me nothing really stood out unless I was being really really picky.\n\nGameplay:\n\nI personally think the gameplay is a little stiffer than it was in the previous two. Before it came out I went through them to catch up and to generally be wiser to enjoy Origins more and I just cannot put my finger on it. It's nothing big, it's exactly the same controls as before. It might just be me being picky unless anyone else can vouch.\n\nRepayable?:\n\nYes, you have multiple modes to unlock, riddler trophies and avatars to scan. There is plenty to do in Arkham Origins and plenty of achievements to get.\n\nMultiplayer?:\n\nProbably not going to take off, I don't think people buy Batman Arkham series because of the multiplayer in the way people buy Call of Duty and Battlefield games. Although a decent attempt and it's always nice to see a multiplayer mode i'd rather them focus more on perhaps putting out little bits of extra dlc instead or even better a co-op mode. But bottom line, Batman Arkham is all about the lore in my books.\n\n\nTotal: 7/10\n\nA successful third game in this series for fans of the previous two. If you loved the first two then there should be no reason why you wouldn't love this one however it will set you back forty big ones which may be putting off a big number of people still wanting to buy this game as it could cost you as much as around sixty pounds / euros for all the dlc (more if you don't buy the season pass and purchase them individually). What is promising is that there is already a new millennium skins pack out for 3.99 which is not part of the dlc so it does look like we will be getting half decent dlc anyways. Personally I hope they take a leaf out of 2k's ideas of dlc's with the work the did on Borderlands 2. I like the first two, and Batman Origins was basically exactly what I was expecting.\n\nPros:\n\n*Fun challenges like the first two\n*Potentially decent DLC coming\n*Good gameplay\n*Good graphics\n*Good fun\n*Plenty of decent achievements to earn\n*Repayable\n\nCons:\n\n*Same and similar challenges like the first two. If you didn't like Arkham City because it was just the same as Arkham Asylum then avoid it.\n*Multiplayer probably won't be that popular, certainly not all year round. Separate Co Op storyline with achievements would be better replacement. In fact that is an amazing idea, so fyi it was said here first. If they want to master multiplayer they should create a completely separate game solely for online like counter strike using that engine, that way servers could probably use different themes including batman origins ones were all the players are batman characters etc. Just a thought;\n*Expensive, wait for a sale\n*Expensive DLC Season Pass, also wait for a sale\n","November 26, 2013","true","28.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Combat has been tightened up mechanically, there are a variety wide variety of bosses, and the game is very beautiful...\n\n...and yet, at the same time, feels somewhat hollow. The predator sequences, where you sneak around taking out goons from the shadows, feel shallow compared to previous installments - not because they're worse, but because they are, fundamentally, the same as ever. You have done this before, and there is no real difference between what you've done and what you are doing.\n\nLikewise, the formula with the villians has worn thin as well - you fight the Joker yet again in this game, despite having already killed him in the previous one. They went out of their way to make this a prequel just so that you can fight the Joker yet again for no good reason. And indeed, the story in the game is disappointing - you are facing down eight assassins, but you never fight more than one of them at the same time, unlike in the trailer, and a number of them are just fairly anticlimactic fights with a super-goon surrounded by a bunch of goons. The story doesn't feel as coherent as either of the previous games, and while the riddler trophies were better than they were in the second game, they're still inferior to the Riddler's mechanics in the original Batman: Arkham Asylum.\n\nAll in all, it is still a good game, but it isn't great like the first game was. Had no one ever played any of these games before, it might have been better, but as this is the third installment which uses the same game mechanics and same villain, it just isn't as fresh.","December 19, 2014","true","54.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unfortunately, it still appears that it has some game-breaking glitches, despite the patches put out when the major ones were made a known issue in Nov. 2013.\n\nThe gameplay itself is pretty much the same as the last two installments in the batman series (Arkham: Asylum and City).   Bats glides, beats-up to string combos and special beatdowns, sneaks around in predator encounters (vent, grate, hanging takedowns are the same)  etc etc.\nPersonally I found it different in the overall feel of the game.  The previous installements seemed to pay much more homage to the comic book character's canon and story, with little touches  such as references to classic or obscure batman villains.  Arkham Origins is the beginning of Batman's career, so granted he hasn't encountered as many in this story line, but I would have preferred some of that love of the actual comic flavor as in the previous (for example: Bane is rocking what sounds to be an attempt at some Eastern European accent, despite being from Santa Presca).  Instead with Origins, we are given a storyline that only barely jives with the continuity of the previous games and gameplay that feels much more   of a beat 'em up and less of a love-letter to the batman franchise.\n\nAs to the glitches, about 56hrs into the game (and gathering every collectible possible) I experienced a clipping glitch where batman fell through the map.  Because the game has auto-save and it unfortunately saved during this, I could not load to before that. Unfortunately, it looks like I will have to restart the game.","April 5, 2014","true","151.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In fact, the circumstances of Wayne's childhood tragedy, training, and return to Gotham as reborn vigilante is already in the past, before the game begins, and he is already equipped with batarangs, grapnel, and Batwing jet. Instead, the 'Origins' referenced are the seeds planted in the story that will eventually mature into the Arkham City future. Along the way, Batman grows from a shadowy rumor to a renowned crime-fighter, having already taken bites out of local threats like Penguin and Black Mask, but also starting to attract enough attention to himself to begin to tip the established balance of power that will change Gotham forever.\n\nUnfortunately, where the previous Arkham Games have built and expanded on the fantasy of 'becoming' the Batman and living his adventure, with his gadgets, intelligence, and fortitude, Origins deviates very little from the City forumla of roaming the night, dealing justice to criminals, solving crime, and saving the city from an overarching threat. There's nothing new here, which is probably good news if you enjoyed City, but will disappoint if you're looking for the Arkham franchise to raise the ante. In a very real sense, Origins is a sort of deluxe-sized expansion pack for Arkham City that transposes that sequel's gameplay back in time.\n\nThe good is that the polish and production values are as high as ever. The animation, cinematics, voice acting, and so on are extremely immersive, and Gotham looks great as a proud, post-industrial metropolis beginning to decay from the inside out. All of Batman's gadgets return, and there are now even more districts to explore, with never a shortage of thugs to beat into unconsciousness. There is a full compliment of challenge maps to medal in, side quests to complete, and obscure objects to find and collect, as in City. The main addition to the Arkham series overall is the "Crime Scene" sequences where Batman explores and reconstructs various crimes in order to solve a problem. While these are very, very simple puzzles, the actions and narrations do give the player a solid sense of being the "World's Greatest Detective", which is often neglected in Batman movies and games.\n\nThe bad is that it will feel very much like playing Arkham City all over again, in a more mundane environment, and with a story campaign that feels noticably shorter when you consider it apart from all the diversions that you might explore along the way. Batman gains new abilities by completing various challenges according to the Dark Knight system, but what might have been enjoyable can easily become a frustrating grind when the challenge requirements do not properly align with the actual given opportunities within the game, forcing you to replay the game over if you want to maximize your potential. Lastly, this is clearly the least stable, most buggy iteration of the Arkham franchise. While most of the issues have been resolved by now, the game does not seem to have been coded cleanly or elegantly. Expect to experience crashes along the way.\n\nConcerning the DLC: The Initiation Pack only features Challenge Map content, which is a good value if you like that gamplay (I do). You can play pre-Batman Bruce Wayne in a weaker, stripped-down form on all the standard maps, along with a difficult, 5-map campaign simulating his training as part of the League of Shadows. Conversely, the "Cold Cold Heart" DLC is a standalone, story-only campaign, with no challenge maps, that doesn't interact with the main Origins storyline at all. If you just like the Batman story and experience without the tedium of Challenge medals, then this is perfect content for you, featuring a complete set of side quests, equipment upgrades, open-world exploring, and plotline with new enemies and characters, and a challenging new boss fight integrating stealth, combat, and gadgets together. As for the Batman costume skin packs, I didn't find them ultimately worth the value. The various suits and costumes generally did not fit well into the strong, well-established artistic design the game already possesses, and were at best comical and at worst distracting.\n\nIn summary, Arkham Origins is retelling stories you have probably already heard before. If once was enough, you should probably take a pass, but if you can't just get enough, Origins is happy to offer more.\n","April 26, 2014","true","153.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was really hoping this game could match them, or get close. I can say that this game is absolutely beautiful, well optimized, and definitely worth a playthrough.\n\nHowever, it absolutely does not live up to the other Arkham games. For some reason the main story feels way too rushed, not to mention short (6 Hours Tops), and the game as a whole seems to rely on the majority of the content being challenge maps. I can enjoy challenge maps, but after playing so much of two other games with the same combat, Im kind of burnt out of just fighting dudes after dudes for no reason.\n\nThere were many parts of the game in which I thought were very well done including environmental design, especially inside the buildings, although the city area as a whole seemed dull. Seeing as this is my review, Im am going to tell you why I was upset about this game because of lacking portrayals of two characters:\n\nJOKER: I think troy baker did some good work, but honestly, it was noticeably off, and with the joker I need him to be perfect or I get really sad. His appearance reminded me of a small elf that grew some legs and put on facepaint, but the joker is the joker and I love it just the same.\n\nHARLEEN QUINZEL: This game made me think it would deliver the gripping Harley/Joker backstory in which I love so much, and it even had a build up in the character development, but then it seems they forgot about the whole situation and left it alone. I am still upset that they didnt finish what they started, especially when it comes to my 2 favorite Batman characters.\n\nOverall, the game is enjoyable, but certainly does not live up to its predecessors. If you are playing this game for the story, go ahead, but you may just end up feeling like something is missing. In the past two games I got 100% and for this game I just didnt feel like it was worth it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frenchiefellow/recommended/209000/","frenchiefellow","frenchiefellow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frenchiefellow/","118 products in account","I had my doubts about this game after seeing a swapping of hands for developers and the metacritic scores, in comparison to the previous games (not that the metacritic was all that bad, its just lower than the previous titles.), but after picking this game up for $7.50, I can say that I got my money's worth and left satisfied. Although we saw the departure of Rockysteady on this title, presumably because Arkham Knight is quite resource consuming, WB Studios stepped in and did a fair job. They kept the good stuff (combat, open world, gadgets) and added a few nice features. Were you not aware of the change in studios, the only differences that might alert you to the fact would be the WB Studios logos and the new look interface. Otherwise, this game plays very much like the previous Arkham games. In my opinion, thats a good thing because it signals the developers knew what worked and didn't try to butcher it. For others, that is the inherit problem with this game; the fact that it is pretty much a clone of Arkham City. Were it not for a few changes, this game would be an exact clone. I really didn't have too much of a problem with this, seeing as its only the 3rd game in the installment and I'm not quite sick of doing the same thing over and over again yet. While its true that there isn't much innovation here, I'm glad that the new developers stuck with a route that worked and not one that tarnished the series. For that, we should all be proud.\n\nThe story in this game is fits well in the universe and unravels the beginnings of several overarching plot points in the series, mainly the beginning of the Batman-Joker conflict and early versions of Harley Quinn before she goes evil, for example. On that note, it was interesting to see the beginnings. Sure, they could have been fleshed out a bit more, but I'm not complaining. The story was good until the end, and I really didn't have any qualms about it. Like I said, gameplay is more or less the same, save for a few reskinned gadgets with slightly different (although still true to core functionality) uses, as well as some new enemies to fight. Combat is the same, with perhaps some new moves down the line when you level-up. The world is still open, and it plays very similar to Arkham City with a myriad of things to do. One thing I really liked, however, is they definitely fleshed out the detective mode here. While its still a very minor part of the game, you can analyze the crime scenes more by reanacting the crime and investigating more clues to solve the crime. Sure it holds your hand and it doesn't feel like it should, but its a welcomed addition that was missing from Arkham City that made me happy to see. In addition, the boss fights have been improved in my opinion, and overall, were a bit more satisfying than the previous game.\n\nThis game is not free of issues, however. I found that the counter key/button was only responsive 75%-80% of the time, causing large fights (10+ enemies) or counter heavy battles to be frustrating at times, as the counters would just not work at all some of the times. This also applied to ground takedowns. It just seemed like the key/button wasn't registering for me at times. There are also some combat bugs, such as enemies flying off the screen when hit or enemies clipping into buildings (still fightable even if you couldn't see them), but nothing gamebreaking here. A major issue, however, is the crashing. It shares a similar crashing issue with Arkham City. While this game crashing didn't seem to lock up my PC, it did seem to crash more often than the last game. I'd say it crashed once every 3-4 hours, and sometimes more often.\n\nIf you are looking for a new Batman game that innovates the series, you'll have to look elsewhere, but if you are looking for a solid and faithful prequel to the last two games, look no further. While this game is nowhere near perfect thanks to some bugs and such, it is a game worth playing and is enjoyable from start to finish.

Although the PC version is still a little buggy. Not buggy enough to ruin the game for me, but I would never even attempt the "I am the night" mode because of the bugs. Also, this game slightly lacks the  attention to detail that the other Arkham games had. i.e. some steam vents can't be plugged with a glue grenade while others can etc. Also, the combat system timing is a little off. Sometimes, quickfire gadgets don't work. I have to jump a couple times to get them working again.\n\nNot at all game breaking, but still knocked off a couple points for me.\n\n7/10\n\nUPDATED: 04-23-2014\n\nCold, Cold Heart DLC:\n\nSome people have been playing this and have reported bugs. I played this and did not encounter a single bug or visual glitch. This was more stable than the original game. It is fun and story driven. The new thermal suit is a little funny looking, but is still quite fun. This DLC is about the same length as Harley Quinn's revenge, from Arkham City. You can beat it in about 1-2 hours depending on how much of the side missions that you complete. It's nice to play a DLC that is more than just a new costume or map.

I am not opposed to change, if that change is good. But then, when I played it, I immediately realized that I was wrong. This game is not a change. Let me explain why:\n• In terms of gameplay, Arkham Origins is identical to Arkham City. It even has the same map. The environments are different, but that difference is merely superficial. The devs made the easiest decision: don't innovate, just recycle. Even the gadgets are the same. Most of them we've already seen before, and the "new" ones are just different versions of the same thing (remote claw=line launcher, though the claw is a bit of an improved version; glue grenade=freeze cluster). The shock gloves are a very nice addition though, but because of its usefulness, every fight after you get them is a joke. Except boss fights of course, in which you will be screaming to your monitor the word "bull****" several times.\n• In terms of story telling, it follows their predecessors with extreme accuracy. The story itself is different, of course. It includes several villains that weren't present in previous installments, but it also includes several that were, and without the need to do so. But there are no plot holes, and the story shapes out well as a prequel to Arkham Asylum. I recommend staying through the credits (despite the fact that credits are extremely long).\n• In the graphical aspect, don't even get me started on the bugs. Man this game is buggy as hell, considering it's been released some time ago. Consider yourself extremely lucky if you get past your first boss fight without issues. And pray that enemies don't get stuck behind walls forcing you to start a fight all over again, and this applies to boss fights as well. I wouldn't say this feels like a beta, but it's certainly close. When it's not bugging out, it's the same as Arkham City. Don't expect anything new here.\n\nIt has its epic moments, don't get me wrong, but it all feels the same to Arkham City, and that's where the game fails: originality. Still, I would recommend any fan of the franchise to get this game, but only when it's on sale, it's not worth the full price.\nFinal score: 3.25/5","June 27, 2014","true","25.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Personally I found the story and amount of side missions much more enjoyable than AC. It was like the first time I watched Dark Knight, type of a feel. which is great. If it weren't for the bugs/crashing on the PC port I would rate it a lot higher. Its my favorite of the series so far and It lets you be batman in a video game where you actually feel like your batman. unlike prior batman games. If your a fan, or you haven't played any of the prior Arkham games Id recomend you pick this one up.

Batman Arkham Origin is the prequel of the Arkham series where the Bruce Wayne just passed two years in battling criminal as the caped crusader\n\nThe story of this game, despite not being developed by Rocksteady nor written by the previous game writer. This game has the best story in overall arkham game series. You will questioning how the moral standard of batman that he will not kill or let anyone get killed, even his most dangerous enemy. When playing this game maybe you will think, "If I were him, I would kill that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ so there will no other victims." And this game told more about Alfred that really wanted his master just live a normal billionaire life, forgetting his night vigilante routinity. And there will be some other origin story about joker too that previously been told by "The Killing Joke" comic. Overall this game has really done a good job in his story aspect about Batman lore\n\nThe gameplay, well this is a little bit down of this game. The overall gameplay is almost identically the same with Arkham City. Even the city is almost the same with previous. Only a minor tweak to the gadget and character proggression system. In this game there will be some achievement that will rewarded you with some perk. But some of the achievement is quite hard to earn and only able to do in some specific places. So maybe for people who don't want to read any guide or such will find himself frustated because you can't do some achievement and your only hope is to do the new game plus that been harder than normal playthrough\n\nMy verdict is, 8 out of 10. Yes I heavily value a story from the game I played. And Batman Arkham Origin has done really good job in telling the story. Even it's not really told the "Origin" about Batman nor about the Asylum itself but I really love the story of this game. More emotional and more character is more lively compared to previous game. But if you value the gameplay more then you will eat a same burger, but this time the ketchup is plentier than the previous.","November 7, 2013","true","32.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The core of the game is still here, so the fighting and stealth sections remain.  Wonky controls, weaker graphics, and ridiculous boss fights are paired with a story that makes little sense outside of the core Joker/Batman meetup.\n\nStill, though, the fighting is great and the stealth is at least as good - if not a bit better - than it has been before.  As a full priced entry, I just don't think it would measure up, but given its reduced sale price, and the reality that it will probably only get cheaper in the future, you can give this one a whirl if you want more Batman.\n\nIf you'd like to read a longer review, give it a shot here.

Not to forget all of the side activities in this game.

The whole Arkham Origins kind of was. Love the Batman franchise though. And most of this would sort of be nitpicking, but it's the little things right?\n\n\n1. Yes I know, he's a "hero". But still, the game taunts you by giving you all these lovely rooftops, and yet you cannot throw people off? Or at the least, hang them from the railings like he does in numerous torture scenes? I mean, the enemy, on the edge of a building, I kick him straight back and he just goes up in the air like he's too good to fall off!\n\n2. If you are giving me the "counter" symbol, and I press the button, it was because I wanted to counter.\n\n3. Gotham is a beautiful city right? I'd like to go to one of their lovely bars and knock a few drunk heads around or something.\n\n4. I know I know, he's afraid of firearms. But still, it would be nice to be able to use say, a tranquilizer gun, or a at least shoot one of the thugs in the knee. I mean if you're allowed to beat them to a bloody pulp with their own skulls, a bullet to the knee sounds like a much nicer way to take someone down if you ask me.\n\n5. The game just starts to become quite repetative quite quickly. The only real difference is WHERE you repeat it. And it's not just the Bat Man games. It's ALL superhero games. Go here, mash the button until conflict is resolved. Attempt stealth but hope to hell it doesn't glitch out on you.\n\n6. Those ♥♥♥♥ing vent covers! I'm sick of having to mash the A button everytime I come across one of those. I mean seriously! What are they, trying to build up our thumb muscles or something? Just play the cutscene, and stop this useless crap.\n\n7. Again, Gotham is a beautiful city. I'd love to be able to jump and run around it all over the place. But the fact that I cannot for the life of me grapple up a simple ledge for some reason baffles me. "Oh but errr you're not supposed to go derrrrr". Well perhaps make it a little bit more obvious with say, a fence or something. Don't give me the hope that I MAY be able to get up there.\n\n8. The Puzzles: Ok, I'll admit, that one where you have to do a whole bunch of forensics is fun. It makes me feel immersed in the whole "detective" role. But when you have to use your little thumb stick to aim at a circle and press one button? I mean, cmon. That's not a puzzle, it's an inconvinence. A break from the gameplay that disrupts the flow and pacing. It's just as bad as the "mash A to open" button.\n\n9. This game is hard just for all the wrong reasons. It's not a challange in itself, it's just buggy and clunky. The controls skips if they even work at all.\n\n10. Instant Respawn Enemies: Ok so I've just spent the last 15 minutes cleaerning a ship full of badguys to make a stealth entrance, only to have walked to the other side of the ship and back, and they already set up shop straight away!\n\n11: Ok I need to know if this "supposed" stealth move is going to be quiet or not. Thanks to not knowing, I now have to redo the whole ♥♥♥♥ing scene again. Yeah, thanks.\n\n12: Bad prioritisation of targets: Don't get me wrong, it's fun to just randomly mash a button and hope for the best. However, if there is a room full of fist wielding thugs, and a man with a machine gun, I'd PROBABLY go for the machine gun first, if that's ok with you.","March 1, 2014","false","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The setting should be familiar to fans of the series. What won't be familiar, however, are the bugs. I ran into a progression-blocking bug and dedcided to wait for it to be patched, until the devs said that they may or may not release bug fixing patches. However, they're still going to release paid DLC. I'm done with this game and I'm sure as hell done with this dev after just one purchase.\nStrongly recommend avoiding it. Asylum has such an amazing story and City is great in its own right, and I'm sure this game is pretty decent too, but I can't bring myself to support it in any way.","February 28, 2014","false","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is pretty much exactly the same. Same(ish) plot, same(ish) boss fights, absolutely the same setting. It's a bit cheeky to ask thirty quid for it then, it might have done well as an expansion pack.\nSo, if you don't own Arkham City, get that instead. If you do own Arkham City, play it again instead. At least until teh price drops. Origins will be worth £20 but you'd be annoyed if you paid full price.","February 26, 2014","false","66.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This time , however, Rocksteady studio is not in charge of development. This episode was made vy Warner Brothers Montreal , and the multiplayer mode was created by studio Splash Damage. Acquisition of rights for Batman by other studios made me a little concerned. Batman games have become one of the best games of all time for me. That's why I was not able to understand why the development was given to another team.\nWhen we start, the game greets us with about 40 seconds of videos presenting companies that was involved in making this product. You can not skip them of course , but you can disable it by adding the command in the steam launch options. This does not change the fact that for the average player videos will be very annoying. Game options are quite extensive and certainly I can not complain about the lack of customization , the only thing I lacked in this section is the lack of key mapping for quick use of gadget. I personally liked to set it to use under the separate button , but somehow I can get over the double keystrokes gadgets.\nGraphically the game looks solid, although really little has changed on this issue since Batman Arkham City . But when we play longer we can notice a lot of glitchy graphics. Cloak often decides to ignore the laws of physics and perform odd stunts. Batman apparently got used to this state of affairs, because it absolutely does not impress him. However, the most drastic visual mistake for which I came across is gliding. Quite often when we fly Batman can't decide whether he is gliding or landing and begins to hop up and down on the screen.\nCombat mechanics are solid as usual , however, almost nothing new was added. The only variety that have been changed ( not even added) is gadgets. Background music is as always spectacular and well fits the atmosphere of Arkham.\nBut how the game's storyline, look? In contrast to the previous titles , this title wanted to show us an inexperienced Batman , who just starts on his way to fight crime. So how Batman shows his inexperience? Here lies a problem. Batman is the same as always, we cannot see that he just started his career. There's not many inserts that tell us about it . At the beginning the villains do not believe in the existence of Batman, but after playing 30 minutes of gameplay they all definitely know the Human Bat is real. Amazingly Batman made earlier his Batwing than the Batmobile, which still lies in scraps in his bat cave. Once we're about two hours into the game, Batman shows his lack of experience when one of the criminals escapes after being knocked down and not tied by Batman. In my opinion, developers didn't use all the opportunities of Batman being in the beginning of his career.\nWell everything , though perhaps less polished, was in the previous parts. In this game , however, there is added multiplayer mode. In multiplayer we have a chance to play one of the subordinates of Joker or Bane, as well as Batman or Robin. Both criminals factions are fighting each other by taking control of places that allow them to earn domination points. The team that accumulates more points wins the match. All the time during this struggle they must also think about Batman and Robin who have the task to stop the criminals. Team Batman wins when bar of terror is filed, and they earn it by doing more and more interesting knockouts, and eliminating team captains. For a long time there was no asymmetrical multiplayer game and I must admit that it is made very well in this one. But the problem arises when someone has a poor internet connection. During my battles in multiplayer very often I've seen players teleporting all around the screen, and some looked like their game just freezed.\nOverall, the game is very nice but does not seem as solidly polished as the previous parts of Batman. After all, the announcement of the new DLC before the solution of technical problems with the game, left me a big disgust . Multiplayer is very nice as far as opponents do not teleport on the the screen. If you are not tired of the previous parts of Batman you can go ahead and reach for the title, although I would wait until all the problems that the game has are fixed. Which apparently will never be fixed. On official forums WB montreal's community manager wrote that they are not planing to fix any more bugs that aren't blocking player from finishing the game, cause they are busy working on new DLC for batman. Just for that reason I would say that you shouldn't buy this product. It's really sad how impudent this developer is.\n\n","February 16, 2014","false","28.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was and am a HUGE Batman Arkham Series fan. I really loved the dark atmosphere and challenge (on hard) of the first game and the high replayability of the second game. With that said, this game in no way pushes the series forward. The raved about boss fights are lazy. This game completely exhausted the combat system (believe or not) and then compounds that with repetitious uninspired stun/beatdown boss fights. The story was also weak and spent way too long to show itself different or new. I found myself (a Batman fan!) getting more and more cynical as I played. I have about 25% of the main story left and I'm not even the slightest interested in how things turn out. (6/10)\n\nPS: For an inspired boss reference, I think Poison Ivy with Catwoman, Killer Croc in BAA, Mr. Freeze, Solomon Grundy, and even Bane in BAA were inspiring boss fights.\n\nUPDATE: I have now completed this game (after some reluctance) and the final fight is just about the ONLY inspird boss fight I've found in this game.","February 13, 2014","false","17.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is engaging and gritty while keeping the plot simple and is meant to give of a feeling of determination to stop what is going on rather than putting 50 plot twists in or going down so deep in Batman lore that you have to read years worth of Batman comics or stop the game to search in wikipedia to understand (thats is not saying there will be no charcters that people will not know before getting into the game but rather the game does a very good job explaining who they are through both the cut scenes and gameplay styles and areas that you interact with them in). Thank being said I think there is two things holding the game back. The main one is that the city in the single player just feels so....... empty you end feeling like your saving a city with nobody in it. Now, the games excuse is that everyone is staying in their homes due to a huge storm, but in reality there are still some people out and about even in snow storms (now saying that is smart or not, that is a different subject) so could had a least a couple of people out and about in the streets, something like saving a woman when those sudden crime reports come up? Even a few npcs would make it feel that your in a living city and not an apocalytic one. (and for any of those that will say that the world is more for collecting, the orgional Crackdown was a collect-a-thon in almost the same exact way and still managed to create a livelier city than this AND was released in 2007) the other promlem is that the multiplayer is boring, which I know is a very common complaint and is really not the reason people buy this game but it still dosen't change the fact that it could be done better than a generic thrid person shooter with batman combat, what makes it frustrating is that all it need to be good was a endless oneline mode with friends similar to the single player challenges or some online co-op.  Don't let the negatives deter you though this game is good just could have been better if Wb interactive wasn't trying to release a new game every year  like it is the combat version of call of duty which I am very afraid that it is becoming like that with the new game announced for this year.","April 8, 2014","true","25.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
