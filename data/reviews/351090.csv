"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/recommended/351090/","chudah","Chudah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/","1693 products in account","Regency Solitaire is a totally charming take on the single-player card game by Grey Alien Games.  A variation on the golf solitaire play style, this fast-paced version of the classic game will have you addicted before you can say "tea and biscuits!"\n\nGolf solitaire involves playing cards in ascending or descending order until all have been removed from the board.  There's a bit more to it than that, but it's a very easy to learn version of the game that will appeal to those looking for a more relaxing experience.  While there is indeed some thought needed in play, once you get the hang of things you'll be a solitaire pro in no time.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=486910736\nThe game is divided into 20 chapters in which you have between 3 and 10 tableaus (boards) to complete a set of objectives.  These objectives get progressively harder with each chapter, but are never unfair in their requirements.  As you successfully complete each tableau, you'll earn money to purchase power-ups that will help you clear cards much easier.  You may also bank up to 11 wild cards which can be used to extend combos.  Chaining combos is the meat of the game play as bigger chains increase your score multiplier, thus rewarding even more money at the end of each chapter.  Of course, luck will play a factor in the draw, with particularly bad layouts often requiring several retries if you don't have enough power-ups or wild cards to get through them.  But that comes with the territory in solitaire.  At least there are ways to overcome it here.\n\nWhile there are several different versions of solitaire out there, this is the first Regency era themed game I have come across, and it's absolutely charming.  Everything in the presentation has an air of gentility to it, from the beautiful hand-painted artwork to the elegant music and charming character dialogue.  The simple yet enjoyable story that plays out between each chapter feels as if it was pulled right from a Jane Austen novel, which is a compliment in its own right.  Altogether, it's a pleasant experience that  will transport you to early 1800's England when elegance and sophistication was prized above all else.\n\nIf you are a fan of solitaire, I cannot recommend Regency Solitaire enough.  Between the enjoyable game play, amusing story and lovely presentation, there's very little I can complain about here.  I only wish it were a bit longer, as playing through Bella's tale of courtship was an absolute joy that didn't last nearly as long as I'd have liked.\n\nBottom Line: Recommended to all solitaire and casual gaming fans.","July 31, 2015","true","23.3"," 85 of 88 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","85","88","4","7"

The solitaire is solid, and there are lots of obstacles and power-ups to keep the game fresh as you progress through the story. Winning hands earns you cash as you progress through the game, allowing you to decorate your manor for a fancy ball. Each of the items you purchase can be used to remove cards, speed up wild card appearance, etc. With a hard and easy mode and lots of twists to the standard solitaire game, Regency Solitaire is pretty challenging and hard to stop playing.\n\nThe art is pretty and fits the setting well, but I wish the game supported higher resolutions.\n\nBasically, if you enjoyed Faerie Solitaire, this offers a very similar experience with a very different theme.","June 14, 2015","true","17.9"," 49 of 51 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","49","51","2","2"

I really do. But getting 100% achievements (without the "cheating" method, which I didn't want to do) is a pain pain pain in the behind. Once you find that last egg, you'll yell with abandon, throw kisses at the faeries and tell them you love them, and then FLEE the game. Free at last! I found Regency Solitaire to be a different matter altogether. You might find that, once you've gathered all its achievements, you feel sad to say goodbye. Of course, you don't really have to and that's the path I took. I'm playing it again and probably will come back to it quite a few times more. Yes, it's your basic solitaire game but with the perfect level of challenge (for me) and a few added mechanics that I really enjoy. I think I'll let you unwrap the game without spoiling anything. If you haven't played Regency Solitaire and feel the need for a solitaire game - check this one out. I don't think you'll be disappointed.","March 27","true","43.2"," 35 of 37 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","35","37","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wardfire/recommended/351090/","wardfire","Wardfire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wardfire/","434 products in account","I love Jane Austen's novels and the time period and plot of this game is right up that alley. Not only that, but it's historically correct with research behind it as well which is always a big plus in my book. The characters are fun and interesting, as well as the plot, even though they fall into stereotypes. The music is relaxing and doesn't get repetitive to me personally and the game play itself feels very smooth and not clunky or heavy like some solitaire games can feel.  I personally enjoy earning currency in-game to buy skills and skill-upgrades with, especially when they are story-related, and earning achievements which the Steam version of this game has. Two difficulty levels Normal and Hard which is great.\n\nSome parts of the game might feel repetitive since there are a lot of levels, but there are at the same time a lot of different level designs going on which helps to dispel that feeling. In some of these levels cards can be rotated fairly close to up side down, at least 45 degrees, which can be a bit confusing and makes it extra hard sometimes. Or extra challenging depending on how you see it. Overall levels designs are interesting and helps make the game feel non-repetitive.\n\nOverall a relaxing game with an enjoyable plot, characters, music and game play. And it might be classified as a casual game, but trying to get all perfect scores in hard-mode, and/or getting the big combos, can take a few tries and requires some strategy and thinking.\n\nPersonally in love with this game <3","May 19, 2015","true","41.2"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

I'm a big solitaire enthusiast, so I went through it rather quickly in normal mode, but I enjoyed every minute immensely.

The levels were challenging, I had to retry some of them a number of times, which rather than making me mad, kept me coming back for more.

Set in the beginning of the Regency Period of England (1812) follow Belle through a matrimonial based societal season as she is pursued by one man but pursues her own dream of finding love and happiness with another man.  These short story breaks in the gameplay offer tidbits of what life was like during this period of history and the common places those of society went.  Bright and colorful artwork of each place added during gameplay as wallpapers.\n\nGameplay: Starts at three hands and increases to ten hands per place invited.  Every hand can be repeated, using retry, if the gamer wishes to achieve or needs to achieve a better score to reach the "local" goals. (Note: once the player moves on previous hands can not be repeated unless the player restarts that level.)   This particular retry feature comes in very handy when trying to achieve the 35 card combo, which as far as I can tell can only by achieved in two places (last chapter Belle's Ball, hand 7 or 10).  My best combo before Belle's Ball was 34 and I ran out of cards. So sad.\n\nThe player can have up to 11 "wild cards" and jokers can be used as any card which makes getting that elusive 35 card combo possible.  There are three "power-ups". 1) Cupid who shoots an arrow (2 when upgraded) to eliminate a single card on the playing field. 2) A fan used to shuffle the cards, and shuffle includes both the cards of the playing field and those remaining in stack.  Can be useful.  3) A fire phoenix that burns 2 (3 when upgraded) random playable cards of the playing field.  (Note: I do not recommend using any power-up when trying for the 35 combo since at most there are only 37 cards on the playing field.)\n\nJust a few words on the card hands, some are very, very challenging.  One of the hardest hands I had only had about 16 cards on the playing field and about 28 cards in the stack.  The way the playing field cards were laid out overlapping one another and having multiple cards with ribbons (ribbons mean the player had to use that card twice) was quite the challenge to clear, and power-ups were certainly handy to have.\n\nOverall, an addicting card game, that moves along rapidly though the levels, and becomes more challenging as the player moves through the story.","February 15","true","19.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dianaincognito/recommended/351090/","dianaincognito","Diana","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dianaincognito/","603 products in account","Regency Solitaire is a very nice, relaxing, charming, yet challenging game.\n\nThe setting takes places during the Regency era in the United Kingdom - early 1800s. The Regency era is noted for its elegance, fine arts, and architecture. It also encompasses a time of social, political, and economic change.  This all is very nicely reflected in the game itself.\n\nThe game is centered upon a particular family within the Regency era, what each family member's role is, and how they handle, or mishandle, said role.  As the storyline continues throughout the game, the player learns a bit more about each family member.\n\nThe artwork is absolutely gorgeous!!!  The music very pleasant and reminiscent of that time era.  You do have the capability to turn off the music, if it distracts you.  There are two different settings, normal and hard. You can go back and forth if you like. If a level is too difficult, you can change the setting to normal ... or vice versa if you feel you want a more challenging game. Two of the Steam achievements involve finishing the game on the Normal setting and also the Hard setting.  [Note: If you do not want to play the entire game over on Hard when you have already played it on Normal, you can click on the last 'pearl' of the game and just play that last level on hard to get that particular achievement.]\n\nThis is not your typical Solitaire game. This game involves the playing of cards in an ascending and descending order on top of the faceup card to be played off of ... until all of the cards have been removed from the tableau (the board).  Within each level, there are specific challenges/goals you work toward achieving. By achieving those goals, you earn money to purchase power-ups, and to also decorate the main character's home.  They go hand in hand. Further clarifying that, each power-up has it's place as a decorative piece within the home of Bella (the main character), and also becomes integrated into the card game itself for the player to use when needed. The power-ups replenish over time -- not by the clock but by subsequent cards played. There are also random 'wild cards' that, once found, are kept in Bella's fan in the lower right corner, to be played when needed. The power-ups and wild cards carry over from level to level if not used.\n\nIf wild cards are used, you will come upon them again by continued play. Bella's fan can hold up to 11 wild cards -- from 'Jokers wild' to a specific card itself. There are no time restrictions, nor penalties.  The player plays at his/her own pace. For instance, if the player cannot complete the hand, has utilized the power-ups, and has used all the 'wild cards' they can use to keep that 'run' going, but cannot remove all the cards from the board by level end -- you earn no money, no achievements, but you are given an opportunity to retry that hand as many times as you like.  You also do not lose the power-ups, they simply replenish over time by each subsequent card played. However, if used, the 'wild cards' must be found again and will be displayed in Bella's fan for play.  The 'wild cards' are placed randomly throughout each hand.\n\nThere are several interesting additions in this game that I have not come across in other Solitaire games, which makes it that much more unique, challenging, and fun.  For example, some cards have big blue bows on them. What that means is that there are 'two' of that particular card on the board, right on top of each other and secured by that bow.  Sometimes, you will find that there are several sets of 'bowed' cards scattered about the board.  By clicking on the first bowed card in an ascending or descending order to be played off of the faceup card, that will utilize that particular card, leaving its double still on the board to be played when the opportunity presents itself ... but no longer 'bowed'. It has become its own singular card to be played. There is also a set of cards whereby one is a 'lock' and the other is a 'key'.  The player will find the key card through gameplay, click on it, drag it over to the lock, which then disposes of the 'lock and key' altogether, which in turn opens up that part of the board that was once blocked by the 'lock' card. Finally, there are also what is referred to as 'hidden cards' which I found even more challenging but fun, not a distraction at all! What happens is that on some of the boards, there is a card amongst the cards to be played whereby the player cannot tell if that is a 'stack' of cards or a 'singular' card on its own until it is clicked on to be played off of the face up card.\n\nIf you've played 'Golf Solitaire' -- this game is similar to that.  You play in an ascending and descending order off the faceup card.  It's the additional goals, types of cards, etc., that makes this game so unique and so much fun!!  Please remember, there is no time limit nor penalties.  You can take as long as you like to study the board and play accordingly.  If it doesn't work to your advantage, the devs have integrated a 'retry' capability ... again, with no time limits nor penalties.  This game does not have to be rushed through or become stressful. In fact, it is quite enjoyable!\n\nAnd, yes ... the devs, Grey Alien Games, have also implemented Steam achievements and card drops!!!\n\nI highly, highly recommend Regency Solitaire!!!!!","August 21, 2015","true","30.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","2"

It's much more fun and complex than a regular Solitaire game because of all the different challenges and chapter goals, and the gameplay involving powerups and combos. You'll never get bored or feel that things are repeating themselves.\n\nThe other thing that makes me love this game is OMG the beautiful graphics. I'd play the game just to look at its art. And also the sweet story and music that accompanies the gameplay.\n\nSo if you're looking for a lovely, non-violent game that's tons of fun, I definitely recommend Regency Solitaire!","June 7, 2015","true","30.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The objective is to get rid of (ideally all) cards on the desk, all of which are faced down except for those on the top. To do it, you start with a deck of cards from which you can draw. With the currently drawn card, you can collect a card from the desk that has one lower/higher value, making that your current card. By continuing collecting cards, you get combo multipliers and hence bigger score. The chain gets interrupted once you draw another card from the deck. Some levels also have special obstacles - locks for which you need to find a key-card on the desk, or royal-locks which require you to collect certain amount of Jack/Queen/King cards in order to unlock.\nSimple enough to play in the morning, complex enough to wake you up :)\n\nEach level consists of several desks you need to clear and has special goals. Those can be getting X perfect hands (leaving no cards on the desk), reaching a certain combo (chain of collected cards), getting high-enough multiplier (can be reached by multiple smaller combos), uncovering an item hidden under cards or getting enough starts throughout the level (3 stars for cleared desk, 2 stars for 1 card left, 1 star for 2 cards left, 0 stars otherwise).\n\nTo help with the goals, you can buy items. Those unlock by progressing the game, while you can buy them for your score. The bonuses vary from revealing certain cards on the desk to increasing the amount of Undo's to special abilities and upgrades. Special abilities consist of target-destroy (up to two) desk cards on top, shuffle all the cards and random-destroy (up to three desk cards on top).\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that there are also special blue cards, which you can collect and store. Those don't have any requirements to be collected nor played. You can use them in order to continue your collecting chain.\n\nThere're also two tiers of levels, easy and hard mode, where hard mode has higher challenges through the goals.\n\nThe art is nice and fitting, though the full-screen mode only stretches the game, making it feel... awkward.\n\nThere were some bugs forcing you to quit the game (and restart the hand), but I'm glad to say that those have been already fixed, and I didn't have to restart the game since. :)","July 28, 2015","true","57.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

But Regency Solitaire really delivers in both departments! I wasn't sure how interested I would be in the plot, as I'm not really into romantical type stuff, but I found myself quickly getting caught up in Bella's world and the colorful cast of characters around her. It was fun to get to pick which power-ups I wanted to buy, instead of the usual "you get what you get when we say you can get it", since everyone plays differently and can have different strategies. The goals at each location keep the game entertaining and challenging for sure. I would recommend Regency Solitaire to anyone looking for a relaxing game...something to take your mind off your busy, fast-paced life because romance is definitely in the cards!","May 21, 2015","true","2.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Something very different from my normal sort of gaming.  I was pleasantly surprised; this is a polished game combining gorgeous variations of solitaire in a Pride and Prejudice setting.  The story writing is excellent, I look forward to seeing the next part of it unfold even when I know what the ending is going to be. The game play is casual and relaxing on Normal difficulty, I haven't tried the next level but I want to.  There are some tactics to consider but it's cards right so there's a lot of luck involved.  Also, support is great, when I had an issue getting the game going, the dev came back to me very quickly and his first suggestion sorted the problem.

Nothing is offensively bad, so as it would distract you from playing the game but it won't get any better than you not minding what happens. There's basically no animation, the game won't support your native resolution, the writing is bland and deals exclusively in stereotypes (unless there is some crazy shift in writing at the end of the game).\nComparatively, you can do a lot better for 10€ (in terms of depth, polish and so on).

The powerups and wildcards add diversity to the gameplay. Although I did not find the writing and some of the artwork to be historically accurate, and though the dialogue and story itself were on the simplistic and cheesy side, it did not tarnish the overall experience and did not hinder my growing addiction. That being said, I feel like there is more potential along this game design for spin-offs or follow-ups and hope someone takes it upon themselves to create more like this. There are so many old world card games that, though are not pervasive today, it would be enjoyable to play them in a similar format to this.\n\nWell done, thank you, more please!","February 5","true","21.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

She's into period pieces and Solitaire; seems like it'd just her cup of tea. And boy, was it. She rather enjoyed the game and after watching her play a few hands, I bought it for myself.\n\nThe game play is pretty classic Solitaire: in that you chain together cards in consecutive sequence in either ascending or descending fashion with the objective being to clear the board of cards. But unlike MS Solitaire, however, suit and color doesn't matter; all you need is the next card up or down. That is to say, a 4 or 6 can be place on a 5, Queen or Ace can be put on a King and so on. You play until you either clear the board or run out of cards in the deck.\n\nAlso unlike MS Solitaire, Regency Solitaire does not simply arrange its board into 7 columns increasing in size, but rather, the game arranges its cards into some very intricate stacks that definitely require a bit of thought and strategy. Not to mention, some of the arrangements are rather pretty in and of themselves. The game also provides you with power-ups and helper cards in the form of Jokers and wildcards. All of which can be unlocked via normal gameplay. They are unlocked using in-game currency earned simply by playing the game and are priced reasonably enough that you shouldn't have to grind chapters to save up enough cash. You can get through the game with nothing more than a little patience as failing to clear a hand has no penalty other than you not making any progress towards chapter goals. In fact, you can retry hands completely free and without penalty. The lavish settings combined with this unpunishing gameplay makes for a great way to unwind after a long day. In addition, the game is suprisingly well-polished with appropriate music, sound effects, and graphical effects in addition to the tight gameplay.\n\nThe complaints I can raise about the game are few and minor, in that they don't really affect the core gameplay at all. I do wish there was a way to view what static buffs you have after buying the item that provides it. I also found it odd that the little Eye icon in Bella's House does not really do anything... seems like it would have been a great place to add in a way to see what buffs you have purchased via a tooltip or something that appears when hovering over the particular item. I also think a way to turn them on and off would make for a nice, sort-of DIY difficutly slider, in addition to simply Easy and Hard. If expanded a little more, a bit more strategic depth could be added by limiting how many perks Bella could use at a time. but that might just be me trying to inject unnecessary mechanics into a game designed with ease and simplicity of gameplay in mind. The other thing I would have liked is if the chapters had more variety to their lengths. Each one being 10 hands after the third or so chapter gets a bit tedious towards the end.\n\nAll said, definitely worth the sale price, but I would still recommend at the full price. It's well designed and well developed with tight and smooth gameplay. Good for hopping on for a few hands or for a lengthy binge.","May 9","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vixzends/recommended/351090/","vixzends","Vixzen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vixzends/","790 products in account","Regency Solitaire is (unsurprisingly) a solitaire game with an over-arching storyline about arranging a ball for lead character Bella in order for her to win the heart of the man she falls in love with. The game was made by Grey Alien Games from Dorset, UK, and it is also set in England taking place at various locations such as London, Brighton, and Bath. There are 20 chapters, with 180 unique levels to play through.\n\nThe game can be played in Normal or Hard mode. I'd personally recommend playing through in Normal mode first, before then playing through in Hard Mode. As you play through the game, you unlock certain things which make game-play easier, such as losing a card or two at the start of each level; being able to undo turns if you realise you've made a mistake; being able to shoot down cards that you can't match together with anything.\n\nTo play the game you simply match a lower or higher card number onto your drawn card, so for example an Ace can be matched with a Two or a King; a Nine can be matched with a Ten or an Eight.\n\nEach chapter has a set list criteria to meet in order to progress onto the next chapter, such as having 6 'perfect hands' out of the 10 levels in the chapter, or getting a combo of 15 cards played at one time, etc. The upgrades that you get for the ballroom, which you buy using gold that you earn for completing a level, makes achieving these criteria much more straight forward, particularly in later levels. During play, you also find 'wildcards' that can be stored and played if you are struggling to make matches, or if you can see that just having that one additional card in play would enable you to make a bigger combo.\n\nThe art style and music in the game really set the tone and style that the developer was going for, and it's very charming and faithful to the period in which the game is set. The storyline is a little cheesy certainly, but I found it rather charming and engaging and I actually wanted to know how the story developed and played out as I was playing.\n\nI finished this game doing a full play-through in Normal mode, then a full play-through in Hard mode in just under 15 1/2 hours. I managed to get all 17 of the achievements for the game in Steam also. I have heard a rumour to get the "Sumptuous Solitaire: Beat the game in Hard mode." achievement you only need to finish the last level on Hard instead of playing through the full game, but what fun is that!?\n\nThis game is a charming and challenging solitaire game which I thought was a delight to play from start to finish. If you like card games with a bit of strategy to go along with the basic number-matching, this is definitely one to try.","May 30","true","15.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I am generally not a player of casual-type games, but this game turned out to be excellent fun. The music is amazing, the art is pretty pleasant - especially the backdrops. The gameplay might raise some questions, since it starts giving you quite steep challenges (beating this game on Hard basically requires you to get the hardest achievements... such as a 35-hit combo and a 5x multiplier), yet it is heavily randomized. But let me assure you: it is just controlled enough so that you can actually influence your own luck and pull off some great combinations. Sure, it's not as in-depth as some other games where you need to find patterns in heavily randomized sets of objects, and it's maybe a bit more reliant on the randomness than those, and you might need to grind (for jokers) a tiny bit, but it's satisfying as heck in the end.\n\nTL;DR: simple, pleasant, satisfying. Recommended for simple fun.","May 24, 2015","true","10.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/igtbtg/recommended/351090/","igtbtg","PhineasPoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/igtbtg/","1474 products in account","TL,DR: If you like Faerie Solitaire, there's not a lot of reasons why you shouldn't like Regency Solitaire. There's a bit of difference between the two, RS has power moves. The difficulty is, at least on hard mode, higher than FS. Other than that, it comes down to length (RS is much, much shorter and doesn't have side stuff like eggs) and setting/plot, which involves a young girl finding love with a fancy man. If you've been through Faerie Solitaire and want more hot solitaire action, this is a perfectly fine place to get it.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe year is 1812, the place is England. Great Britain is once again at war with America. I don't believe this ever mentioned. Maybe it was. Whatever. If you want war talk, go play the Downton Abbey solitaire game, you ungrateful monster.\n\nThis is a game where you play as Bella, an ugly boy in drag who wants to marry a fancy man. Your brother somehow gambled away all of the family's money, I guess because your father fronted him his inheritance. There is a neighbor man who is interested in you despite the fact that you have no money and are an unattractive boy. You're not interested in this man because he is boring and you are unfamiliar with the saying "beggars can't be choosers." You go to stay with your Godmother who is at a places where balls are. Dancing balls. And man balls. This is a game about finding love, after all. You also have an Uncle George, who looks very old-timey British.\n\nYou are in love with Henry, a man who loves ugly boys. Your brother continues to be garbage. You have a sister, Charlotte, who is much more attractive than you, but every one is too polite to mention this. Gameplay is seamless integrated with the plot. Someone will say something like, "We should throw a ball for Bella!" and then you are playing solitaire. Upgrades come in the form of decorations for your body (clothes) and for your ballroom that seems to travel with you. No one thinks that maybe the family's money issues could be solved by maybe not building a mobile ballroom and maybe not hiring piano and harp players because #yolo.\n\nIn all seriousness, if you like Faerie Solitaire (the gold standard of solitaire games that you're kind of embarassed to play) you'll most likely enjoy Regency Solitaire as well. It's basically the same game. You have a card and you need to click on a card that's higher or lower. You want to clear the board or come as close to it as possible. Each chapter has a set of goals you must achiever. Like in Faerie Solitaire, you can get wild number cards (however, you may not collect one of each, but you can get face cards and there are true wild cards which can act as any card), you can purchase upgrades and you can build up combos.\n\nWhat's different? Levels have star ratings. A perfect is three stars, but if you're close you might get one or two stars. When a combo is over it is added to a gold multiplier that last the whole level (but not the chapter). You have three power-ups that do various things and are recharged by making matches. Also, in Regency Solitaire the cards are often at goofy angles like sideways or upside down. I'm sure this is a metaphor for emotions, but it's kind of annoying, especially with that whole 6 and 9 thing.\n\nA great thing is in Regency Solitaire, you can retry individual hands without restarting the chapter. However, if you're OCD and feel compelled to get a perfect on every level you will have to find a way to cope with the shame of seeing the "NO STARS" ranking. Otherwise, you will be forever retrying and you will be trapped in the insidious Venus flytrap that is this game\n\nAnother noticeable different feature is that if you skip over a card that can be played, the card you could have used on the board will shake. This happens even on hard mode. It's kind of nice, but if you bought Regency Solitaire hoping for a hardcore challenge, then. . .I don't. . .maybe talk to a doctor, because you might be having a stroke.\n\nIf you like Faerie Solitaire and you're not ashamed to be playing an ugly boy-centric prequel to Downton Abbey, it's a fine game. Faerie Solitaire might be a little better, it has challenges, it has the eggs that will ruin your life if you want to 100% the game, there's just a little bit more. If you've had your fill, Regency Solitaire is more than adequate. Maybe get it when it's on sale.","July 27, 2015","true","13.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","4","6","3","0"
