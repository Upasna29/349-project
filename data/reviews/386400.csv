You always control all 4 of the poles at the same time which may result in unwanted shots on your own goal if you hit your own player while moving the mouse. I would like to choose which poles to move at any given time so I can position my defense while attacking with the middle and attack poles for example. Hold buttons 1 and 3 to move pole 1 and 3 or hold button 4 to move only pole 4 for example. There could be issues with keylocking keyboards but maybe there is a way to implement something like this. The expert mode kinda tries to do this but only seems to work with a controller.\n*EDIT* With the latest update (v1.03) some changes addressing this issue were introduced. While I haven't gotten to test them out myself (still waiting for a demo to avoid the buy-refund-cycle), they seem to be a step in the right direction. At least the developer seems to be involved with the community and striving to improve the game.\n\nIssues with physics:\nThe ball behaves weird and the hitboxes sometimes feel a bit odd. It doesn't feel like the ball is truly rolling around the playing field and it sometimes gets stuck, diverted or slows down without an obvious reason.\n\nI really wanted to like this game and waited a long time for a game like this but this just isn't it... yet. It sure has potential and I will gladly give it another try if it gets updated and improved but for now I will have to get a refund. Asking price (at least with current 30% discount) would be fair if the game wouldn't have the issues I mentioned. Unfortunately I can't enjoy it in its current state. :/\n\nA demo would also be nice...","December 17, 2015","false","0.6"," 33 of 41 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","33","41","4","0"

I actually used to have a Foosball table in my bedroom (“Baby-Foot” in French - go figure!) and used to hold tournaments with my close friends. Boy, this was fun!\n\nFoosball: World Tour is a casual Football game simulation where you play the world game (Football) on a specifically made table with four rods on each side of the table: 2 rods in defence, 1 rod in the middle field and one rod for the attack. The aim of the game is to score the most goals against your opponent on the other side of the table.\n\nOn the single playing mode, you will be able to play in 20 different locations around the world. Each location will have a certain level of difficulty (from easy to master), different types of table (French, Retro and more) and different type of balls.  You will have a variety of objectives; it may be the first one to reach 10 goals, or you may have 10 balls per game and whoever scores the most goals win the game.\n\nAt the end of each game you will be awarded up to three stars; accumulate as many stars as possible and you will be able to unlock trick shots, such as snake, pull, tic-toc and pin shots. You also can customize your foosmen from Mafia to Hotdogs!\n\nIt will take you a little bit of time to get used to the controls regardless of whether you are using the gamepad or the mouse and keyboard. Whatever you prefer to use, expect accidentally score plenty of own goals for your opponent, which can be a bit frustrating! The graphics are decent and you have a good soundtrack.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Fun to play\n-	Unlock trick shots\n-	Single and online mode\n-	Good soundtrack\n-	Achievements\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Controls will take you time to master\n-	No Single player tournament\n-	No trading cards\n\nFoosball: World Tour is a fun and competitive game; it will no doubt bring you some great memories!\n\n7/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

There are a lot of good ideas for it. specially for total freedom of moviment. Even in expert controller i feel a little "stuck", it should smoother with a few patches.\nGraphic is very good and fits perfectly the nowadays standard.\nOnline is totally empty, but it´s passable because it is the very first selling day, so i hope we have more people to buy the game and test.\n\nVery fun, it needs only a few fine tunning to become almost perfect.","December 11, 2015","true","0.9"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

It is a great simulation of the Old Tornado and Dynamo type Foosball tables, I had played in gamerooms for years. I suggest getting this game if it is your type of game. Two Thumbs Up from me, I even bought the DL and have not unlocked anything yet. With a little input from players and some developer tweaking, this game will be a gem. I am very happy they made this keep up the good work.

Controlling the ball is not intuitive and takes time to master.  But once you get the hang of it, the game is very enjoyable.  Of course it's nothing like playing Foosball on a real table, but it's fun, and not very expensive.","December 12, 2015","true","3.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Repeatedly flick the right stick in the general direction of the goal and you'll come out ahead. There may be some more strategic potential to this game, but I haven't found it yet.\n\nThe reason why spamming works is because if you try calm and calculated shots, the ball usually just rolls past your foosmen. The physics of blocking aren't very advanced, nor are they adequate. The ball just like, slows down as it hits your guy. It's like your men are made of semi-permeable membrane.\n\nMouse/KB controls are extreeeemely sensitive and way to easy to own-goal yourself.\n\nI agree with the other reviewers though. Good soundtrack, sufficient graphics, Settings are decent, I ran it natively at 21:9 resolution (2560x1080).\n\n6.5/10 because no one else has done Foosball as a video game this well yet.

It's kind of a simulation game of Foosball (table version of football) , where you're able to challenge other people, locally or in multiplayer mode, or just play against various difficulties of A.I.\n\nAdvantages\nVariety of customization possibilities\nGraphics are surprisingly up to date\nExceptionally good and precise controls, especially on controller\nMusic makes players pumped to play\nA.I. is well made, playing on medium difficulty matches an average skill of beginning player in my opinion\nDisadvantages\nPhysics of the ball desperately need some fixes, sometimes it behaves like it's haunted\nThe idea of controlling every rod causes a ton of own goals\nSummary\nThis is a nicely done game, based on a simple concept that would be an amazing thing... only if not those two, some might say - little inconveniences. Unfortunately, those two cons make the game very hard to master, as ball behaves unpredictably and there's no way to pass the ball between your lines due to control over all of them at once (it's hard to explain perfectly, but I think that all of you will figure out what I'm talking about :) ). Excluding those discomforts, the game is very fun, especially with other local players. It also offers a ton of customization options, like tables, balls, match settings or "foosmens" and a level system in online multiplayer (which I unfortunately didn't get to test out yet as I couldn't find anyone playing it). So yeah, the game is good and fun to play, the only underdeveloped thing are the physics of ball which is annoying but not bad enough to have any major impact on gameplay. Game - recommended :)\n\nPersonal score\n7.5 / 10\nIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!","April 1","true","4.6"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

There were just too many negative points to even enjoy this, even though I love Foosball itself.\n- The controls felt completely off, it either reacts too fast or not at all\n- You move all player rows at once and end up shooting against yourself more often than you'd like\n- The ball gets hit or even shot when it clearly didn't even get touched (bad Hitbox)\n- "Trick shoots" act on their own, you don't even need to do a thing but press a button to score a goal\n- In Career Mode, especially the earlier levels, bots are playing more against themselves than you\n- Playing with a controller, you literally don't even need to do anything but shoot to win games, it's THAT easy.\n\nA few good aspects are:\n+ It's Foosball.\n+ The graphics are alright\n+ Some shots are nicely animated\n+ There are a few game modes to choose from\n\nBut really the gameplay didn't get me, sadly I cannot recommend, I even went as far as to refund it. It's a nice idea, but it takes a lot to successfully turn a controller/ keyboard+mouse into a Foosball table and unfortunately this game didn't manage to do that.","May 16","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
