It's worth noting that this is written 9 days after the games release from Early Access - so supposedly a finished product.\n\nThe biggest change is that they have now fixed the fatal error bug that was making the game unplayable - I played the game for over 5 hours straight without a single crash. Crate auctions also now seem to work.\n\nUnfortunately my assessment of the game remains the same, great idea, poorly implemented and now finally having been able to play it is my opinion that the gameplay itself lacks any substance.\n\nThings that I believe are poorly implemented:\n- The tutorial is awful, and even the biggest defenders of the game admit this. You can get the basics from it but its clunky.\n- The UI / Menu system is also awful. Its particularly a problem for the tutorial where the tutorial instructions get obscured by pop up windows. In the actual game itself core functionality, such as saving, wanted lists, achivements / perks, missions / plot aren't accessible at all through a menu instead you need to use key bindings.\n- One of the most common tasks you'll be doing in game is loading your transports with cargo and setting destinations and this is badly implemented, the interface for it is clunky and illogical requiring you to switch between a minimised window, but I also encountered a number of bugs where transports locations were incorrect i.e. listed as travelling when in fact in a country, and also when plotting the route only to find it thought the transport was in a different country. The pathing for the movement itself is also inconsistant e.g. its signigcantly quicker going from Russia to North Korea, than North Korea to Russia - as it takes a different route. Unless stationary your transports will more often than not appear as planes on the map, even after obviously traveling through a port and taking a sea route.\n- There is no explanation of the target finder missions, and they are not built into the plot.\n- The main story arc was broken for me when I purchased some discounted weapons but was intercepted causing me to automatically dump my stock so I couldnt complete the mission.\n- The text e.g. "no longer for sell" is either written by someone who has English as a second language or... well lets not go there.\n- It looks like a whole bunch of stuff that was planned hasn't yet been implemented in game i.e. reputation system doesn't seem to have any impact (and isn't explained anywhere), meeting demand doesn't impact sale price, wars don't seem to resolve as you'd expect, and a general lack of missions.\n- There's a huge disconnect between sound and the game, what happens in game has no effect on sound at all that I could tell. Its just a sound track on loop alternating between things such as street noise and music. The only time sound comes into play is if you sit like an idiot and allow the countdown to a hunter catching you to get low.\n- Not really important but as I made myself sit through it for the purposes of the review, the intro is the most boring and cliched crud I've ever come across. You sit there in complete silence for the intro too, it could have perhaps done with some voice acting, even if it was done badly by the dev team themselves.\n\nGame play:\nI played the game on normal difficulty and it was ridiculously easy. The forumla to progress is straight forward and repetive and offer no challenge or depth of strategy:\n1. Buy interl for countries around Russia.\n2. Repeatedly go back and forth between Russia (your starting location) and the country with the best sale price until you have enough money to upgrade your hull (capactity).\n3. Complete the sale mission, and shortly after an order request.\n4. This gives you enough money to may out your transport, buy another and bribe some generals.\n5. At this point you'll have a couple of routes to choose from, and you just grind back and forth selling weapons to the same country listed on your intel.\n6. Eventually you'll have enough cash to start a war. You can normally cause it to war with two otehr countries.\n7. At this point you just go round to every supplier nation, buy everything up and then ship it to the warring nation.\n\nThat really is all there is to it. It quickly becomes repetitive and boring. The game could badly do with a complete overhaul of the story with the inclusions of missions to break up the grind. I enjoy games of this genre such as the orginal Uplink, but there's just not enough variety in Arms Dealer to keep it interesting for me. Some people clearly do enjoy it, maybe you'll be one of them.\n\nI do have a huge problem with the developers of this game. They clearly made a choice to move from early access knowing that this would cause people such as myself to buy it. They then complain on the steam forums, direct quote:\n\n"We do not ask for free positive review,how ever we do ask for you guys to be less eager at giving negative reviews, if theres something you dont like, hey post it here, we are almost 24/7 checking the forums,"\n\nI think it illustrates a complete lack of respect for customers that they are pointing the finger at people reviewing a supposedly release ready game, when it was their eagerness to take our money that made them take it out of early access. They whine that EA didn't turn up all the bugs and necessary feedback to get the game right, and that they don't have money for "a room full of testers", not my problem I only care about the product I paid for. They've adopted an "everyone elses fault but ours" attitude, even blaming the Steam review system, whilst themselves trying to manipulate it by encouraging people to only leave positive reviews, saying planned DLC wont be free unless they get the needed sales. Hypocracy.\n\nOriginal Review: Posted 28 March, 2 days after release of game from early access.\nAvoid a FATAL ERROR - Do not buy\n\nGreat idea for a game, could have been amazing except someone got greedy and released it before it was anywhere near ready. In it's current state (supposed to be full release and not EA):\n\n- Game crashes frequently giving a "FATAL ERROR" report, lots of people are reporting this on forums. Supposedly patched, but its still doing it just as frequently.\n- No Save / load menu, you have to save games by pressing F5. You can only delete saves by quitting to the main menu, choose load and deleting from there.\n- Its difficult to work out your most recent saved game after a crash because the values such as "play time" are all incorrectly set the same in the description.\n- Assigned at least one mission with no explanation of how you got it or what you have to do. I'm referring specifically to the "target" mission you have upon starting the game.\n- Some story missions fail to explain what you have to do sufficiently e.g. Country refreshes its stock. I completed it by accident.\n- The family yacht is a plane.\n- Winning crate auctions gets you nothing - guessing not implemented yet.\n\nThere will be plenty more but the game keeps crashing so I can't get to them to find out. Its a real shame, could have been awesome. I'm still going to persevere hoping they fix it.\n\nToo many games like this eaither being released broken, or released from EA without meeting their promises. They are destroying their own industry.","March 28, 2015","false","11.9"," 173 of 202 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","173","202","3","11"

I was so excited for this game, but it's from a new indie dev that isn't ready for primetime.  As other reviews have noted, the UI is painfully bad and sometimes counter-intuitive.  It's so early in development that all you can do is shuffle arms to make money.  Doing so is fairly dull feat, as all of the potentially interesting content: alignments, rivals, law-enforcement, plot, quests, aren't implemented yet.\n\nThis game could theoretically get better, but right now I can't recommend it.\n\n**RELEASE DAY UPDATE**\n\nBottom line up front:  Still underwhelming.\n\nThe UI has gotten better but is still not good.  The popup dialogs are still obtrusively large and don't close/minimize in a common sense kind of way.  The tutorial popup is particularly bad as it's opaque, unmovable and stays behind most the other popup dialogues.  The other UI element, the world map has gotten slightly better but is still lacking.  You still can't scroll the map at all (arrows, WASD, or mouse drag) and can only do point zooms with a scrollwheel.  Some of the countries are so small that you'll be pixel hunting to click on "The Random Islands" (ingame country name for the Maldives, no clue why).\n\nSome new mechanics were introduced.  Building and upgrading vehicles is actually interesting.  Bidding on blind crates is a decent mini-game.  So are the "Black Umbrella" terrorist acts to trigger wars.\n\nStill the overall game is painfully dull.  It takes a certain lack of vision to make arming Iran with Israeli arms for an invasion of Central America boring.","October 15, 2014","false","5.0"," 161 of 219 people (74%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","74","161","219","13","6"

Of course, it you don't like business sims, you won't like it. You play an arms dealer (duh) who is set to became the leader of its trade. You manipulate governments to escalate wars, track down the best deals, build your own logistic fleet to move the hardware around; all to make a neat profit. Of course, there is governmental agencies who tracks you down and bounty hunters to escape, and still more coming!!\n\nOn the other hand, the learning curve is not for everyone, i dont recommend to buy this if you like having you hand held through most of the game, or dont like making errors. You will learn from them, but it might cause you to lose at first.\n\nVery good progress have been made by the developers to make the game worthy of a finished product, and they are still working on it very diligently. I may not show many playtime here, but i got the game from a certain place first, where the  developers themselves wrote that " trial by torrent is a viable scenario, especially for indies. " which i agree completly. The simple fact that they took the time to post this made me buy the game right away; a company such as this deserves to be supported. I'm more than happy to help people who assume their errors, and go out of their way to make the best possible product, literally fixing bugs reported in the forum and then coming with a hotfix in the following hours.

I have two large warnings, I think you won't be happy if you are not comfortable with these:\n\n- It is very much an indy title.  The interface is a bit rough, and sometimes difficult to interact with\n- There are some bugs here and there, but the developers are responsive and a new patch just rolled out\n\nThe game is often described as a Business Simulator.  To be more specific, I liken it to a grown up version of the old DrugWars game.  Buy low, sell high, pay off your loans, evade the cops.\n\nThat is it in a nutshell.  Sounds simple, but there is a reason people still play DrugWars / DopeWars on every platform available:  It's a fun formula.  It replays well.\n\nAnd Arms Dealer has a lot that it adds.:\n\n- The variety of content and number of locations are huge.\n- You have a wide selection of public and private transportation options.\n- You can build and customize your transport vehicles\n- You can involve yourself in global politics, and instigate wars to manipulate markets\n- The metagame of evading law enforcement as well as headhunters adds a great layer of excitement\n\nBut I can't overemphasize my first two cautionary elements.  This is not a high-gloss title with millions of dollars behind its development.  It has some problems, and the interface can be a real challenge.  If you are easily frustrated or don't have the patience to learn something that is a bit counter-intuitive, this probably isn't for you.","June 1, 2015","true","2.4"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

Despite this I have yet to experience any significant crashes or glitches. Content is definitely lacking at this point but I understand their desire to aim for major content releases, especially as the game launches out of early access soon. That said it is a unique and enjoyable simulation experience and for gun enthusiasts it probablly has more firearms than any other title. The possibility of free DLC and mods make this game a hidden gem.\n\nWhat makes Arms Dealer and its development house truly special is the level of honesty and communication that Case In Point's chief developer keeps with the community. Other staff reflect this quality and it has been a great experience for me in restoring my faith in early-access and small development houses, especially after placing so much excitement into "The Stomping Lands."\n\nIn short while I would recommend the game I cannot recommend more highly the house and staff behind it.

The idea of being a shadowy merchant of death who bribes generals, puts nations to war, and sells every sort of imaginable weapon to make disgusting amounts of blood stained money while evading authorities is endearing and fun to role play. I love it. Because of my subjective enjoyment alone, I reccomend this game.\n\nObjectively, the game shows promise, but needs a lot of work.\nThe interface gets in the way quite a bit. A prime example of this is travel. Say you want to move to Poland with a bunch of cheap machineguns from China. Click Poland right? Now you have a window for Poland. Ah! A travel tab! I want to take my private yacht so I'll click private travel. That....made a minimized window. Close the window for Poland. Unminimize. Poland is not selected. Choose private yacht. Now I have to click a button to plot course. Window minimizes. I can't click Poland, I need to click a chain of countries leading to Poland. That makes sense, some countries may have investigators or might not be paid off enough and could intercept my shipment. click click click. Okay, I have a path to Poland. Wait, I need to load my machineguns into the transport to be taken with me when I travel. Okay, got my machineguns loaded, I've told it to sell them instantly when I get there, I've bought intel to tell me how much profit per unit I'll make. Good to go. My yacht turns into a plane and flies through the countires I've plotted to Poland. There's a quick travel option too, but it never brings cargo and can take you on ridiculously inefficent paths, and a Public travel option which is great if you'd like to wait 7 minutes to go to one of 5 or so countries you've never heard of with 45 tons of Israeli pistols.\n\nSeveral aspects of the game are incomplete or still being worked on, though it seems that they are being diligently updated by the developers. Some hidden menues don't do anything, a great portion of products are missing portrait graphics, Quite a few gameplay systems are implemented but seem to not be fully flushed out. There's definitely a lot of behind the scenes variables and factors that impact gameplay which are kept obscured from the player. The tutorial is also a slog you have to troubleshoot your way through.\n\nOverall, I love the game personally, but you might not if you're not willing to tolerate its shortcomings. The game does show promise for future versions, but at the moment it can be a hassle to play through for someone who doesn't absolutely love the kind of game it is.","March 31, 2015","true","17.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Time of date moves at least X8-10 faster then a real day. Great soundtrack, and most importantly, it's never about shooting guns. The game loads up ultra fast since it uses gamestudio, and it may be even faster then one of those flash games or phone apps. This game definately has that kind of feel similar to a phone/flash game, but the major difference is that this is a stand alone game, hence you are not bombarded with microtransactions and dlc content that you won't want to even pay full price on. There is a lot of different types of gun to trade, and sometimes keeping track of what you have and what you can sell to specific countries may take a while to get used to. but overall it is a very enjoyable experience, and may offer a relatively differemt experience for people who play a lot of fps games, but want to get into the selling side of the business, rather then the side that buys them and uses them.","October 20, 2014","true","18.3"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","12","20","2","0"

However right now at this moment it seems very shallow.\nSo let me explain a bit.\n\nArms Dealer is a business sim where you whizz around the world selling weapons illegally trying to beat the competition and stay ahead of the law while getting $tack Bundle$ of dolla dolla.\nSo let me focus on some of the actual buisness and economic aspects of the game seeing as they are it's core mechanics.\nWell it all seems a bit two dimensional and areas that could be incredibly deep seem very vauge and not properly explained or disfunctional.\n\nFirstly- supply and demand. Basic economic principles. Certain countries are called Arms Suppliers, and they, suprisingly, supply you with guns. Nations like France, Switzerland, the Uk, Russia, China and the USA and a few others. Each supply thier own national models of firearm and they differ in price based upon assumed quality (though this isn't an ingame value and it abstracted rather crudly I feel to simply "PRICE" reflecting it's supposed quality)\nEvery other country in the world is an arms buyer. Yup thats right- except for maybe 8 or 9  nations no-one else is selling or making any sort of firearm in the world. No-one.\nYou can't even buy surplus stock of other countries weapons from them. This seems a little unrealistic seeing as countries like Syria, Iran and others are major suppliers of weaponry. Secondly, over-abundance of supply seems to have little or no effect on price. I sold 265 crates of grenade launchers to the Netherlands during thier War with Ukraine (thus taking those weapons off the market effectivly as i bought up all of Russia's supply of them)\nHowever a few in-game days later I returned to Russia, the supply had magically regenerated so i bought them all again and went back to The Netherlands and sold them for the exact same price. Now I know weapons break and degrade ect but within an in-game week and half I had sold a massive $400,000,000 worth of Grenade launchers to the Netherlands which would be fine. Except I basically flooded thier market with them and just raked in massive profits. Surely someone at Netherlands HQ (tm) was sat thier doing stock take thinking "♥♥♥♥ we have a lot of Grenade launchers we don't really need to pay much for them anymore" and why was no-one in Russia going "♥♥♥♥ Grenade Launchers are popular lets double the price"\nIt broke the game and was a simple exploit. In a month of back and forth trading I made 1.2 BILLION and jumped from being the worlds number 100 arms dealer to 18th. It's not really providing any depth or challenge is it? And this is all before The Agentcy (the law enforcers baisically) even were aware I existed. In fact they didn't try to activly stop me until i reached 11th on the table.\n\nAfter that it was easy sailing, I could go to any country I wanted and buy up thier entire stock and sell it all en-mass to The Netherlands and make huge profits. All this time I didn't sell a single gun to Ukraine, but this didn't seem to affect the war at all. No there are potentially 99 other arms dealers in game, (but so far I've only happened to chance upon 1 of them while I was chillin in Cuba waiting to make the trip to the USA.) So maybe they sold the Ukraine guns but that data, if it exists, isn't easy to find. In fact I didn't find it. So I have no idea. But surely selling almost the entire arms producing worlds stock to one country would end the war pretty quickly?\n\nSo to spice things up a bit I decide to become a war maker. The game has a feature called Black Umbrella where you can manipulate nations into going to war with each other. But this seems overly complex and abstracted, I didnt; really know what I was doing except green numbers good, red numbers bad in creating war desire. It broke immersion a little bit, and it was also ridiculously easy. After making so much money from my arms dealing I could withstand the price of any of the triggers needed to start the war. 3 million is all it took to make Ethiopia and Poland go to war, I make double that in a single Russia-Netherlands Grenade Launcher run these days.\nEthiopia and Poland. WTF. How would that even work? Geo-politics doesn't seem to exist in Arms Dealer on a sort of level. You also cannot make Arms Suppliers go to war, despite the USA, Russia, China and Israel being probably the most likely countries to get into a war.\n\nThere seems to be a bit of an attempt at alliances though with COMAX, NATO and NA opinions changing of you with every purchase and sale but frankly this all seems a little pointless. I have no idea who is in any of these factions beyond simple guesswork as faction lists don't exist or if they do I couldn't find them and no tool tips existed to tell me where to look. No do I have any idea what they affect. At first I thought price. Russia is probably COMAX and Netherlands is probably NATO, but the prices of Russian weapons didn't change nor did the quantity despite the massive sales and -6000 COMAX opinion i was generating on each trip. So I have no idea if thats a bug or what.\n\nSo thats a lot of negatives and you're probably wondering why I recomended this game. Well frankly it is a lot of fun. I really enjoyed the idea of using a freight ship to move hundreds of tonnes of munitions to Mexico and then manipulating them into a war with Finland and getting insanely rich. It's also very addictive and I stayed up way too late these last few nights thinking "I'll just do one more trip" or "I'll just make one more war"\nSecondly, the potential for depth is there. With a more in-depth economic system and geo-political system this game could be fantastic. It could be highly complex with a very large challenge attached to it. So for the moment I'd say buy the game and enjoy it for what it is but pay attention to it and it may develop into something amazing.\n\nEDIT: I'd also say that the dev's are really fast at trying to fix things which is a refreshing change given the current tidal wave of utter ♥♥♥♥♥ that has swamped Steam lately. Permanently unfinished Early Acess games that sit vacant for months are strangling Steam and overcrowding it with medicority, the comitment of the devs is a true breath of fresh air.\n\nSecondly a lot of people are complaining of bugs and crashes, i've not had any crashes or obvious bugs so far. The tutorial is very clunky though.","April 3, 2015","true","5.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

This game is not the most beautiful game out there. Nor is it the most well polished game mechanically speaking. Sorry devs but that is just the truth. The game has its small issues. No dodging that.\nBut the good outweighs the bad tenfold.\n\nI really dont want to write a wall of text. So i will bullet point the good and the bad and keep each one concise:\n\nThe good:\nA simple UI that shows you what you need to know when you need to know it. It also looks nice enough.\nA story mode that can be skipped. I dont know about you guys but i am not the biggest fan of story modes in a game like this. I like to just play. There is a nice sandbox mode which you can change the options for such as starting cash and so on.\nRandom events. A lot of games do this, of course, but this feels a little more random. It wont get to a point where you realise the random events are purely scripted and tyou can predict what will happen. Wars being the best example of this. Knowing that any nation can declare war on any other nation is actually kind of fun.\nFreedom. Play your way. Different from story mode in that this applies to the game as a whole. You decide the best way to earn yourself money. Will you take advantage of the recent conflict that broke out? Will you decide to deal with only one part of the globe, perhaps only dealing in Asia or America? What form of transport will you use to smuggle your goods? Will you make an alliance with or destroy the competition? you get the idea.\nInformation, information,information, in a good way. The weapons you sell all have their own factoids. And some have been updated to suit the period the game is set in. And there is a good amount about your business. Everything you need to keep the money coming\nRelated to my last point, info is not free when it comes to supply and demand. There are mechanics in place that require you to pay for information about a country.\nThis game does not hold your hand. Once you have finished the tutorial you are on your own, for the most part.\nSmall point: Agencies hunting for you. There is a most wanted list in the game. Obviously you would expect it but this game does it quite well. There is a real need to keep an eye on the different agencies in the game.\nUpcoming DLC that will expand the game into other criminal enterprises. Want to be the next Walter White? Well your meth labs are on their way :)The bad:\nThe tutorial is not the best ever. Sometimes it does not provide you with enough information. And worst of all its easy to break it if you accidentally stray from the tutorial or rush ahead a little and you will find yourself with a tutorial that no longer progresses.\nAnother small point: At this moment(without modding) you cant change things like your starting country. For me that was kind of irritating. I saw my Arms Dealer as a bit of a British gangster type.\nI personally dont mind the feature i am about to mention but i understand why it is silly and would not mind if it changed. Odd countries going to war. Sometimes two countries will go to war that will make no sense. Sure its a game not real life, but its an immersion breaker sometimes.\nI also noticed that some countries that would normally go to war with each other in a heartbeat are not available to choose when attempting to foster a war.\nThats about it for the bad list. There are features i would like to see. But nothing i would consider a let down for the game. Just personal preferences.\n\nIf the theme attracts you. And you like managment type games, you will like this game.\nI know its said a lot but just keep in mind it is an indie title. Dont judge it by AAA standards.","April 1, 2015","true","4.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

I realise the game is still early access. I'm not sure if some of these things have been mentioned, I don't have time to read forums much. I would like to make a few suggestions and a little run down on how I found the experience to be.\n\nOverall the game is fun and addictive. Just needs more things to do, to make the game last longer. Need more things to spend your money on. Needs more end game features.\n\nBe able to evade the agency, hide your tracks so you are not discovered. Found game to end too quickly. Game loses its appeal if you know your only going to lose eventually. (not sure if you are able to avoid agency or not, have not discovered if you can, if so disregard)\n\nWhat is the purpose of the upgrade button, and bounty safety? couldn't figure out what that was supposed to do. What do the agency and peace keepers bars mean?\n\nHave sandbox mode available from the start, although I do like and want a story mode. I found the challenge missions really difficult straight from the get go, scale the challenges just for story mode just to ease new players in, then randomise it after a few are completed.\n\nI also noticed someone mentioned they want a pause option, although I found I didn't really need to pause, I would have liked to have had that option as I pressed escape into the menu thinking it was paused, but then came back to an end game report screen. I guess pause in menu would be good and pause in game to make everyone happy.\n\nI would also like to add that I really like the range of weapons you have, great that you have used real names. Also surprised to find you have the CheyTac in there ;-) Keep up the good work so far.\n\nJust my 2 cents","November 13, 2014","true","9.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Nicholas Cage aside, the movie was fantastic. Watching other series such as Jormungand only served to heighten that interest. Something about the allure of traveling the globe selling weapons sucked me in; the money, the danger, the thrill of closing a deal, and the power looming behing it all. I have been looking for a game like Arms Dealer ever since, so needless to say I was thrilled when I found it on Steam. This game gives you the same power and control of an arms dealer. Nothing feels quite so satisfying as closing a multibillion dollar sale of AK-47s to Columbia while narrowly avoiding the law enforcement hot on your tail.\n\nThat said, this game is definitely not for everyone. It takes a certain amount of patience, so if you're looking for some kind of fast paced, Call-of-Duty esque game, look elsewhere. This IS a business management game, so managing the interface (which is incredibly detailed and takes some time to master) is just a part of what you're signing up for. Some negative reviews have called this "counter-intuitive," but for a game so large in scope, it is going to feel unwieldy at first until you learn to master it. Also on that note, the tutorial is... lacking, but despite that I still caught on fairly quickly.\n\nAnother aspect I would like to note is that yes, the game is still early on in the developmental stage. You can expect crashes, and my game save was erased whenever the game updated, forcing me to start from the beginning again. That said, I expected that coming in. This game is still early on in development. There are going to be bugs. None of these errors took away from my enjoyment playing the game, and from the way I've seen this developer work, I have faith that this will get fixed in a timely manner.\n\nIn short, know what you are signing up for: you will be getting into a detailed, entertaining management game where you feel like a badass mastermind, and as the game is still being worked on and updated, you as a community member have a huge say in how the game moves forward.\n\nIf you have a few bucks to spare and are a fan of Lord of War, Jormungand, or feeling like a global badass, this game is certainly worth it.","March 28, 2015","true","18.1"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

I don't like writing reviews on Steam but I had to review this game.\n\nI spotted this game while it was on sale and it was recommended to me by Steam. Considering that game is discounted as well, I quickly put it on my wishlist before buying immediately. I took a look at the comments and all the people were reporting a "fatal error" bug which was breaking the game everytime. Developers quickly got rid of it so I told myself lets give it a shot.\n\nThe game is very complex. You feel so dumb while playing the game because you actually don't know what to do. Even after playing the weak tutorial mission you don't understand anything. I myself stood in front of the screen like an idiot for ten minutes trying to understand what the hell is going on. I am not going to tell the details about the game but the most annoying thing in the game is that you can't fast forward time. You have to wait a lot for your cargo to reach its destination.\n\nDevelopers are very polite and very quick to implement solutions in the game. At least they are not trying to bully the people who downvoted the game.\n\nI think this game will be ready in a few months but I don't recommend buying it right now.\n\nAlso, the family yacht is a plane.

I recommend to play it once, wait a couple of months, then try it again.\n\nI haven't been the one to play tycoon/sim games, the only other tycoon I have played other than flash games was Video Game Dev, and I thought it was swell. As far as I know, to my knowledge there are not any other games like this. I have close to 300 games so hopefully that entitles me to review this. I'm going to try a Pros/Cons list.\n\nThis one time in Russian Nuclear Blast camp, Yuri Orlov bought 400 AK-47s and Russia couldn't defend itself from Wheat Warriors.\n\nPros:\n+Original concept\n+Large arsenal to buy and sell\n+Mod support (Lord of War mod)\n+Endless scenarios for conflict\n+Dev team activley works to fix bugs and improve the overall experience\n+Sandbox options make replayability a possibility\n+You can now name your character, so name yourself Yuri Orlov.\n+A fun experience to actively participate in making history by selling weapons to either or both sides of an armed conflict.\n\nCons:\n-Some countries are still not accessable (Notably Austria being merged with Switzerland)\n-Learning curve is not too too steep, but unless you play the tutorial you may not make much progress.\n-UI is meh\n-Story is non-existent\n-Some windows such as the Wanted Persons or the News window do not have an accessible button fromt the map, instead you have to open the controls and look up the hotkey.\n-Transportation is meh (You can build new vehicles with futuristic addons but travelling in anything other than your yacht is annoying and slow.)\n\nApril 2, 2015","April 2, 2015","true","8.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I actually forgot it on for like 6 hours (most of the "play time" I had so far, haha - I haven't had a chance to play it as much as I have wanted to) and came back to it still running without any crashes.\n\nGameplay seems very fun so far. It's a fairly traditional trading sim with some nice twists. You have to pay money to get intel to determine the market for different guns since you're working on the black market. Or you can just buy guns and try to sell them blind. You can make a little money just selling from supplier countries to buyer countries. Or make your own demand - initiate black ops jobs to start wars between countries, then make bank selling the countries weapons at higher prices.\n\nSeveral official organizations are trying to catch you and you can be tracked and build up a bounty and become wanted. You can also work to either track and do bad things to your competition, or make alliances with other arms dealers. I haven't gotten far enough into that to see how it all works. I know you can bribe officials to stave off bounty hunters, but I haven't dealt with them yet either.\n\nThe only issue I have had is the economy breaking and demand becoming static (which lets me dump ridiculous amounts of weapons at high prices without dropping them) but other people I've talked to haven't had that issue. I contacted the devs about it and they seemed very surprised to hear about it and are currently working to fix it, so if you have the same issue know that they're working on it (although extra reports wouldn't hurt I'm sure).\n\n-edit- The patches fixed the above issue I was having.\n\nI'll come back and update the review once I have time to play the game a bit more, but so far I don't see any reason for the negative reviews.","April 2, 2015","true","23.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I found a bug when i was playing so i posted it on the bug section of the discussions and within 2 weeks it was fixed and patched, enough said.\n\nNow the game itself is very addictive buy low sell high and on top of that you have the agencys to deal with, rivals, and your fathers old friend showing you the ropes then to top it all off you have auctions in any country where you manage to bribe the general and these can be very lucrative or there may be nothing but that is the fun of the auctions.\n\nI'll finish by saying that although there is still work to be done before this is a finished game, it is very enjoyable and the devs are excellent they respond to your problems within sufficiant time and try there best to get it sorted, with that said i look forward to future patches and in game content and can't wait for other games from these guys.","June 5, 2015","true","74.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I eventually had to skip it (which, thumbs-up, I was able to do so).\n\n-Tutorial is bogged down with a tutorial message system which is burried under persistent action/interface menu windows.  The tutorial attempts to allow the player a choice of how they wish to accomplish the ambiguous goals... unfortunately, this allows the user to make some bad choices, which then bogs down the tutorial advancement.  Fortunately, like the bugged Into, it can be skipped, that is to say, you can quit to the main menu.  This is critically important, because unless you "attempt" the tutorial, you can not play the main game (which... is ok IMHO).\n\n-Traveling is... confusing.  Am I sending my "boat" accross the mainland to a land-locked country?  Where Am I now?  Am I moving?  A better color-scheme with a persistent "Status windows" could help.\n\n-Finding the best market is unpolished, but leaning in the right direction, IMHO.  For example, Intel from Russia says Sniper Weapons are the lowest price... Ok.  But all Sniper RIfles are the same low percentage?\n\n-Loading up.  So I loaded my yatch up... it can hold 6? tons of goods.  Okay.   Wait, so 8 portable (breaks down for portability) sniper rifles takes up 12,000 pounds (6? short tons)? yeah... right...\n\n-Selling weapons.  Which ones did I buy?  Where did I put them?  Okay... let me just sell from my boat, I'm sure it will be... where.... okay, let me see, I think I bought sniper weapons, let me choose that category... WHOA that's a lot of sniper weapons... which one do I actually own to sell... this one, nope, this one, nope, this one... YES, it says I have 8, okay, sell those... it says I just made a profit, that's good... forgot what I paid for them... guess that mark-down category was at least some kind of accurate...\n\n-The interface does not "let" you know it worked, which leads you to wondering, did it work?  A simple animated color-change and the common "click" sound or some cool voice confirmation would be great... incl, cha-ching, vroom, zoom, clunk, etc.\n\n-Some of the game's components are based on time... .  There is a pause, good... though, things going too fast does not seem that much of an issue.  No speed-up control is however severely missing.\n\n-Saving... very unclear, I finally found it in the options menu.  Definitely needs to be more up-front.\n\nMy Final Verdict: Its sorely unpolished, but this could change with the future.  The concept is good, and fills a niche which hasn't been touched since a decade or so with the severely antiquated and not supported, "Guns Girls Lawyers Dollars".  Got some spare money, get it on sale, play it later...","June 7, 2015","true","0.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"
