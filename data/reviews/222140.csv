The twist is that you're controlling a puddle of liquid by tilting the screen - and it may be difficult to keep it all in one place. Failure can be gradual - losing a tiny drop is no big deal, but they add up throughout the level. The game can be almost as frustrating as Super Meat Boy - and almost as fun.

While the idea itself sounds rather straightforward, the execution is certainly not. The first levels, using water as a liquid, are not too difficult and I thought "tihs game is going to be a piece of cake". But how wrong I was (am actually). Difficulty goes up steeply and the developers have really thought of all kinds of possible liquid and obstacles to make life ever more difficult. Water, oil, goo, fertilizer, nitroglycerine, all pass the review and all ask for a different approach. This keeps the game interesting, since the visual context changes accordingly to the liquid being processed. And since the visuals are really outstanding for an in essence static background, the developers have done a good job.\n\nBut after a couple of hours, my interest in the game diminished since I got tired of the trial-and-error which seemed to be necessary in some of the later levels. So I let the game rest for a couple of weeks, and picked it up again recently. Now I pick up some levels ad random and try to get more of the Steam achievements, which are a clever addition to the game. All in all, this game is a nice sideway away from any larger-scale gaming projects, but don't expect anything more really. If Steam reviews would have a "neutral" option, this one would get one. But in the end I give it a "thumbs up", if only for an original idea being well executed, with a lot of love for the project being involved.\n\nGameplay: 17/30 (interesting at first, but too difficult after a time)\nGraphcis: 16/20\nSound: 5/10\nLongelivety: 5/10\nTechnical/stability: 16/20\nPersonal appreciation: 5/10\n\nOverall: 64/100","August 20, 2014","true","8.0"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","33","37","0","0"

Puddle does more than that. It runs, drips and oozes its idea through almost every conceivable formulation.Levels characteristically take the form of a laboratory or industrial setting – somewhere with a lot of pipes and tubes. By tilting that scene left and right and letting physics do the hard work, you guide a volume of liquid through various courses. Along the way a multitude of hazards from furnaces to buzz-saws threaten to simmer and splatter your solution.That’s the sum of Puddle’s mechanics, but it’s how it pours this concept into dozens of different scenarios that makes it so engaging.The liquids vary greatly, each with a series of challenges designed around it. What really elevates Puddle above many other physics puzzlers is not these individual puzzles, but how they are cleverly threaded together. The entire game progresses in this contraption-like manner, adding a sprinkling of adventure to the proceedings. The only other issue is the controls. Puddle uses the left and right mouse buttons to tilt the screen in the corresponding direction, but there is no way to adjust the extent of the tilt aside from repeatedly releasing and pressing the buttons. Consequently, great care is required in timing movements; otherwise the liquid might accelerate too quickly and separate into smaller globules, usually leading to a slippery end.All in all, Puddle looks like a simplistic game – after all, you have to press only two buttons. But it offers so many diverse challenges that you'll be quickly proven otherwise.","September 18, 2014","true","4.1"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","21","22","0","0"

I've already finished nearly half of the levels in a little over two hours (and I am sure some of that was time away from my computer or watching something momentarially-as lately I have been watching YouTube in the background.\nI say 'finished' half of the levels because some, if not many of them I didn't even rank in. I have more copper than silver and more 'check marks' (i.e. finished, but did not rank) than gold (and likely silver).\nBut the poor 'what exactly do I need to do to rank copper, silver or gold, isn't really the problem... anyone can figure that out after playing a level a few times... no, the problem I found is that in the labratory levels, specifically playing Nitroglycerin, if you start the second level of without directly beating the prior-and even then sometimes-your will immediately explode, restart the level and repeat. Even that can be a simple error in coding, not spawning the liquid correctly, or the game assuming the liquid is moving too quickly as it 'jumps' into existance... but when you get to the Body levels, and specifically the blood levels I constantly get a divide by zero warning. This doesn't crash the game, but it does freeze it until I 'windows key' out and click 'ok'.\nI haven't gotten past these levels yet, as I fet it inportant to add this to a review. If you are programming anything you really NEED to make sure you don't have code divide by zero. Usually it will completely crash software (ah, the blue screens of old), and I'm not entirely sure how this software is able to cope with it.\nThe game looks finished and even polished, until you reach the bugs that clearly show it is not. It is still fun to play, and for those who feel the need to get gold on everything you'll have a challenge... but they really needed to go over their software and make sure things worked correctly, each time, for all hardware.\n(A FYI, I'm on an HP Pavillion 7000, with Intel I7 and nVidia GeForce 630M, running WIndows 7--so it isn't like I'm trying to run the game on obscure hardware or software).\n\nEDIT: So, I've had to 'skip' some levels...

It has a wide variety of liquids in different levels with different properties which you move by tilting the level, attempting to reach the end in the least amount of time possible while losing the least amount of liquid possible.  It should be fun, and at the beginning it is, though it quickly loses its luster.\n\nTo start with, the developers have the gall to give you "whine" tokens to skip levels and on the difficulty selection, go on about how playing on normal is for whiners.  Seriously?  I haven't seen such hostile behavior towards players since Phil Fish's "PC's are for spreadsheets" debacle.\n\nThe game starts off well, giving you a good variety of liquids to use and obstacles to overcome.  Goal times vary wildly, with some levels being trivially easy to get a gold medal on, and others near impossible.  Towards the end of the game, levels can become quite frustrating with precision "jumps" required using liquid that spreads out often beyond your view on the screen.  Then I got to the zero gravity levels, where instead of controlling gravity, you control slow-moving paddles to bat the liquid around in levels filled with walls that destroy the liquid.  It has to be the worst idea anyone has ever had for a physics game and stopped me from progressing any further.\n\nStay away.","July 7, 2015","false","4.3"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","18","27","4","5"

It's just one of those games that doesn't draw much - if any - attention. 'Impulsive' is a word most of us will recognize here. Myself included. Before playing I had no idea what this game was all about. 'Why ?', I keep asking myself. Because this game is great fun.\n\nEssentially Puddle is a platformer game where instead of a character you control multiple fluids (sticky, explosive, you name it). You know the drill; getting from point A to B. But there are switches to be flipped, fluids to be split and more, and you have to tactically move your fluid because if the fluid get below a certain amount it's game over. Some of the later levels can be truly frustrating, but at the same time fun and, in a way, relaxing.\n\nIt looks great in motion, I truly adore the artwork. It's simple, yet sophisticated and colorful. Just check out the screenshots and you know what I mean. The sound effects get the job done, in a realistic way. It's what you'd expect.\n\nTo all my fellow impulse-buyers; please do check out this game.

And if you reach a level where more demands are made, and the player is unwilling to commit intellectually, they can take one of four “whines” (two whines on “extreme” skill level) in order to skip that difficult level. Each category grows more challenging as it progresses, and each group is VERY different from the preceding one. Each fluid flows differently, and is affected by factors such as fire or consumption by carnivorous plants (though gratefully not on the same level.) A glass globe filled with water must be handled with great delicacy, as must nitroglycerin, both in the Laboratory section. (But it may also be necessary to CAUSE small amounts of the nitro to detonate to proceed. Or to sacrifice fluids to make a branch break to facilitate a pathway, or destroy a container to free a fluid to flow. Such skills are a bit beyond the “small child” level.) Some fluids are highly flammable, but can also be extinguished if action is taken quickly. Sometimes “winning” may consist of sending a flaming mass of liquid pouring quickly over the finish line (though not likely with a high score).\n\nFor those seeking an intellectual challenge on an intensely scientific level, this game is just a little slice of heaven. While in its simplest form this game is simply gravity acting upon fluids, Puddle vastly exceeds the simple. Anyone not familiar and comfortable with the phrase “water seeks its own level” may find themselves at a severe disadvantage, but understanding Newton’s laws of motion is REALLY helpful. Ultimately, as there are only two buttons, there are also two goals: get as much of the original fluid mass to the finish line as quickly as possible. If the constantly monitored fluid level drops below a preset amount, you lose. If it doesn’t, you WIN! What you win is gold, silver, copper, or simply completion. The scoring is given in the form of a rather sophisticated graph where the meeting points of the two measured variables are displayed in comparison to the three award levels. Players are also informed if their score is a new record.\n\nIt takes skill and intelligence to use the force of gravity alone to keep the fluid in a compact mass, especially when it’s gravity trying to spread it out and break it into separate droplets. On several game levels that may be helpful, on others, the deal breaker. Some fluids, such as water, slosh about and need to be “damped” (as is done with the swinging weight hanging from an overhead crane.) Often trailing bits of fluid must to sacrificed so that the leading mass isn’t slowed as it crosses flame, or other reductive forces. Knowing that science will help the trailing fluid to move faster, thus pushing the slowly moving leading fluid quickly over a destructive force is often critical. So is trusting that momentum will keep fluid moving uphill if direction is changed as early as possible, helping the full mass end up downhill faster than if you waited. The real challenge in this game is trimming milliseconds off the time, and adding the tinniest fraction of a drop to the mass by speeding it along instead of waiting that extra tenth of a second.\n\nFor many disabled or impaired players, this game is “perfectly” simple. All that’s required for play are the left and right arrow keys to tilt the world displayed onscreen (though split-second timing can be VERY crucial in many levels.) I have played exclusively on the Mac version, and Puddle does not appear to have adaptability for colorblind players. The game is very nearly photo-real with a wide range of colors, and the fluids themselves often change color during play. I can’t speak for how this might be an issue for the “color-impaired”.\n\nThere are some issues with Puddle. If your fluid gets broken into several masses, the camera may ignore the one needed for completion. I’ve had to manually close games when I was unable to even know where the remaining fluid was, much less maneuver it effectively. On my Mac the mouse is useless in the menus. The menus themselves need LOTS of work. It would also be nice if the score you were trying to beat was shown in some way on the score screen, or better still, in the graph. To see what scoring you’ve achieved on each level takes several steps more than could possibly be necessary. Some levels (Human Body: Tension & Stout Hearted) are FAR more difficult and cumbersome, bordering on impossible, on my Mac than what I’ve seen on YouTube.\n\nAll in all, the BEST $2.49 I’ve ever spent on a game in my life. I expect to be playing this game for quite some time to come.","February 26, 2015","true","54.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

For these reasons I would rate the game 7.5/10.","October 8, 2014","true","22.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hrdkr/recommended/222140/","hrdkr","Hrdkr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hrdkr/","372 products in account","Puddle is perfect in almost every sense. It's a not that typical indie game, it's challenging, have a fast pace, it's finally a real fun! This is a sole indie title I played till the credits since a long time.\nIn this game, as you can see in the trailer, you control the liquid. The only method of control is to tilt a world a little. Basically the tilt creates a height difference between the liquid and the ground and the former accelerates due to gravity. You can use a keyboard arrow keys, but I personally recommend a gamepad triggers. So, you use just two keys to progress through the whole game.\nThe game's world is divided to several chapters, which consists of number of levels. Each chapter represent a visually and aesthetically differing surround and the type of liquid you control in it. In some chapters you have different types of liquid in different levels. You starting at Watercourse with a coffee, proceeding as a water, then going to the Nursery transforming into weed killer (Sodium chlorate + copper oxide), become a fertilizer, travelling to the Laboratory, where the liquid turns into a hydrocarbon, oil, nytroglycerine, fruit juice + technecium solution... Human Body, Sewers, Rocket, Foundry, Nuclear Power Station at last! Each type of liquid has it's unique properties, water freezes and evaporates, nytroglycerine explodes when handled without a care and lava hardens when it's far from the heat source. The gravity in zero-gravity zone is actually zero, but in the centrifuge at the nuclear station with tremendous radiation levels the gravity alters after short distance travelled. You need to adapt you reflexes and to reinvent controls patterns with almost every new world's and liquid's conditions introduced in the game. And that's really fun.\nFor me, the most funny part was a human body chapter. It starts like a real anatomically true human body but quickly you realize, that this 'body' has nothing to do with it's real world representation. The game's 'human body' is abstract as hell. As a chapter climax, your liquid get absorbed into the circulatory system, the view gets zoomed to 500x and you find youself in a blood cappilary system. You barely can control such a microscopic amounts of substances by tilting the world, so your gamepad's triggers, being rhythmically pushed one after another, pumps the blood and your precious solution of juice and technecium, which some fool drank, will jerkily flow through the capillaries. The fun is massive.\nSeems like game developers had a lot of ideas and that's great they realised a good part of it. THe game doesn't just exploiting the idea and brilliant representation of realistically looking liquid physics model through the whole game, which will be a tempting approach for some indie game studios. But no, they developing and evolving the original idea level after level, adapting and transforming it. And you just keep getting amazed when new properties and world conditions get introduced.\nAt some levels the game is really challenging. Some levels can be passed only after 30 tries or so. Some levels' obvious difficulty can leave you infuriated and with no progress. And this is undoubtedly true for the very final level. There are no chances you can beat it in one sitting.\nThis game is great. Small graphical inconsistencies here and there, like non-working antialiasing on 1440p cannot make it not great. The whole idea and implemention are great. If you're into indie gaming and your library is not like CoD 15 and BF 5 likes all the way up and down you should probably check it out. And I presume you'll not be dissatisfied.","March 29, 2014","true","7.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Goal of the game is to get as much as possible of a liquid to the end of the levels by tilting the gameworld left and right. Sounds easy enough but can get tricky in some levels - most levels are rather short though, so the big amount of whining about the difficulty on the Steam forums really surprised me. Finishing the game on normal difficulty settings requires some trial & error but isn't that hard, however getting gold medals on all levels (by finishing them in a short time and without losing much liquid) is definately a big challenge for all completionists out there.\nWhat makes the game really shine is how much effort the developers put into making every level unique and interesting although the player's basically pressing only two buttons over the course of the whole game. There are several liquids with different attributes and handling, most of them reacting differently to their environment (pesticide, acid, nitroglycerin, lava and more).Then there are some levels where the liquid is inside a container like a beaker or a snow globe, thus slightly changing the gameplay (there's also one level without a liquid at all which, incidentally, was the only one I didn't like).\nAdd to that the diverse and well designed levels themselves: from an obligatory sewers level over levels inside the human body to a zero-G level in space - the game does a very good job at keeping things interesting despite its simple concept.","July 28, 2013","true","5.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It's probably not a game I would recommend playing straight through, but to fire up from time to time and finish a few levels, I think it's good fun and worth it to have. I say this because depending on who you are it could be frustrating to finish certain levels or achievements. To me this is a good thing, as it adds playtime and I always feel accomplished when I finish a level that was difficult for me.\n\nSome people may not like it, but I laughed a good bit over the "whine" button and the message you get when you're choosing the difficulty. So much so that I shared this with friends who don't own the game. Hilarious, and I thank the devs for including those gems!\n\nEven on my toaster for a PC the game looks beautiful, and runs fairly well.

I used a controller, and there are really only 2 buttons for this game.  You can tilt the screen left or right to make your liquid move.  The liquids vary from level to level, which keeps things interesting.  For example, water evaporates if you get it close to heat, while nitroglycerine explodes.  And each new liquid's unique traits come into play in the levels.  You can skip levels if you get frustrated, but you have a finite number of skips (that you can earn back if you do eventually beat a level you skipped).  I had fun, but eventually quit without beating it, as it doesn't have a checkpoint system and I got frustrated by later levels.","January 13, 2014","true","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game just didn't feel good to actually play. It doesn't feel like you have much control over what is happening at all and you are just watching it play out. Your only controls are tilting the screen back and forth which has very little affect on the liquid and only makes minor changes like you either will or won't make it past the obstacle if you aren't pressing the correct way. What makes it frustrating is that even if you hold the opposite direction completely the liquid still keeps moving along the path with or without you making you feel like you are just along for the ride and not actually figuring anything out.","March 21, 2014","false","2.2"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

You don't know what you're being scored on until you finish each run.  On some runs you need to conserve fluid, on others you need to be as fast as possible.  Unfortunately, there is literally no way of telling which level is which type until you've reached the end.\n\nFurther, the game is heavily trial and error.  There are many curves and jumps that you need to be going a certain speed over to clear them successfully, but you have had to set that speed up two or three jumps previous, and often a few screen lengths away.  Also, you can't scroll the screen, so you can't look ahead.\n\nFurther still, the game is physics based, so your run is a little bit random each time as any slight variation (including random chance) modifies the position of your fluid, making some levels impossible on some runs.\n\nTo cap this trifecta of fail off, the whole time the game is making fun of you for your forced failure, calling you a 'whiner' for skipping levels that you get overly frustrated in because of aforementioned trial and error gameplay, laughing at your poor times and mocking your difficulty choice.\n\nWhat would have been a neat physics game was outright ruined by terrible design practices.  90% of the game's issues could be fixed if the score system was published before a run, and if there was a map or scrolling overview of each run shown before you began.\n\nDo not buy this game.

The camera is also confusing, sometimes following the liquid at the front and other times following the largest mass of liquid, which can make it either impossible to control the majority of liquid or impossible to see what's coming next.

The designer expects you to just figure it out via trial and error. It is very difficult to plan your moves ahead of time to avoid hazards because you have no control over the camera or how far ahead you can see. At least a level preview would have been nice for this. This destroys the sense of control and that is something gamers despise greatly. To make matters worse, they have a skip feature if a puzzle has you thouroughly stumped. Insultingly they called the skip a "whine". ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the gamer who may or may not recommend you game is a bad business plan and you just lost a recommendation here are a result.

However, levels are well planned, letting the player interact constantly with it.\n\nPuddle lets you explore two main ways to finish a level: take a while and focus on keeping the most of the fluid intact or rushing through the level to get the best time. Yet, you'll have to combine both ways, to make the best score.\n\nThe puzzle characteristics of the game doesn't make it boring, on the contrary, it requires a good use of its dynamics to complete them.\n\nWhile not being exactly immersive, the audio and graphics create a very pleasant atmosphere that merges perfectly with the entire purpose of the game.\n\nA Bit short but a great choice for those who like casual and puzzle games.","July 26, 2014","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's definitely a great game as far as design goes. The controls are simple yet unexhaustable in ways you can use them for everything (this is a two button game). Physics are also always nice to have in a game, and this one is based around it so that's a plus.\n\nThere are two real problems I have with this game. The first one is that the game is very unforgiving, in a bad way. When you fail the level (which means losing too much of your liquid, which I'll come back at in a moment) you will have to redo the entire level. Most of the levels are pretty long, but only because parts of it are relatively easy but very slow. Failing at a harder part in the level (usually the end) will mean you will have to do over maybe 3 minutes of easy and slow work. If you're a failure at games like me, that gets really frustrating very fast. Now on to the second problem I have with the game, the fuzziness. Everything in this game is based on the amount of liquid you can get to the end, but the game itself decides whether liquid is part of the main group or not. Usually that means that when there is a blob of magoo ahead of a smaller blob of magoo that you still wish to move to the main one, you cannot because it ends up moving out of the view. I have failed levels a lot of times because of not being able to see all the liquid. Keeping liquids together is one of the main objectives of the game, but should not be a pain.\n\nI would still recommend this game purely for the fact that the easier levels are quite fun. If you don't have to restart levels countless times you can really appreciate them. It's a well designed (in visuals and levels) game with mechanics that are new and exciting (at first), but I would really like to see more of it than I could have in my few hours of playing.","February 22, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, I still do not recommend this game, as it is not really FUN. This however, is according to my personal taste, so I will elaborate further.\n\n=================================================================\n\nThis game seems at first to remind me of fun titles such as World of Goo, Nightsky, and other physics based platformers with objects to control.\n\n(-) However, its more frustrating, as the liquid is not as controllable as you'd expect. Most times, it is quite random how much liquid you'd lose along the way, so getting a gold medal depends more on luck (and trying a million times) rather than having perfect control of the "physics".\n\n(-) The game has options to assign different "left" and "right" for the liquid and for the environment, but this simply doesn't work. It makes the game unplayable. Not sure why they have these settings when all you need are 2 keys to play the game.\n\n(+) This I suppose makes it a pro for keyboard players, since you don't need an XBOX controller to play this game, like many steam games nowadays.\n\n(+) Another good point is that there is a lot of variety. You will "handle" different liquids in different environments. The artistic value is there, and it does show that the developers tried with this game.\n\n(-) The variety however is pretty much summed up in the two lines above. You will not have to use your brain or solve puzzles to progress. You simply follow the linear path, trying to avoid obstacles or things that will reduce the amount of liquid you have. You WILL lose liquid. The point is trying to get to the end with enough to progress to the next level.\n\nUnfortunately, this game simply isn't as fun as the games mentioned above.\nI have played many games. Some pull you in. Some repel you. This game does neither. For this I am still inclined to open it up and play it to the end, but at the same time I'm not really having as fun as I do with games that do pull me in.\n\nThere isn't a challenge per se. You go from A to B without any chance to deviate from the path.\n\nI still open this game up from time to time, as I like to complete my games.

The sound effects, although perfectly in character, exacerbated this feeling for me.\n\nThe levels are generally about controlling the momentum of the slow-moving liquids, usually solved by forward planning rather than quick reactions.","March 11, 2014","false","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Puddle -as you may have seen- is sort of a physics based puzzle/platformer. You indirectly control puddles by tilting the screen around. Most levels are obstacle courses which you must skillfully navigate to the end of as fast and efficiently as you can. When you complete a level, you are ranked by two criteria: time spent, and liquid lost. Though it's not necessary to get a medal to advance to the next level, ranking well can unlock certain achievements and objects for the ingame sandbox. Levels have numerous hazards which often correspond to the theme of the current chapter you are in. You journey from a kitchen table, to a laboratory, to a botancial garden, to the sewers, and to even more interesting locales.\n\nAs you progress, events of the game cause a series of reactions much akin to a Rube Goldberg machine (those 20+ step contraptions you see in old cartoons which ultimately do one simple thing) which wind up changing the liquid you control. In fact, your liquid can even become sticky rat goo, heavy contrast materials in the human body, and various gels! The great thing about each new substance is their new properties which reflect at least semi-realistically how they'd act in real life, and how each will have a special quality not seen in any other substance. For example, in the botancial gardens chapter you use both weedkiller and fertilizer, and you have to figure out when to kill plants, or when to grow something, or even how to tip a plant over by running your liquid across it. In my opinion the single greatest strength of this game is how well they keep things fresh by changing up scenarios, even if occasionally a substance may react a bit differently then how I'd expect it to in real life. The only examples I can definitely think of are the water and ink. They both should probably move faster, though the water should have a greater degree of cohesiveness due to the surface tension which ink lacks. The ink should be much harder to control and bleed everywhere.\n\nNow I'd like to quickly address some other aspects. I liked the visuals a lot. The visuals are a pretty big draw because each chapter has different color palettes, cutscenes are animated pretty well, and almost every level has it's own background. I only noticed a few repeated backgrounds or stage assets (ignoring levers and buttons of course). As for the music, I think it's okay. Not great. Suitable for the game I suppose but not really memeorable, moving, or something I'd listen to outside of the game. Next up is the sparse story. It's cool how everything flows together, but ultimately it could have used more personality. The story told is just a means to an end effectively, so I guess it really IS like a Rube Goldberg machine. Second to last gripe here would be the lack of content for the sandbox thing. It doesn't have a lot of accessible assets and it has a low cap on how much can be onscreen, despite it being a very small box, which limits creativity a bunch. Finally, the difficulty. Whoo boy can this game get tough. Only 2.3% of people have actually finished the game because the later levels can get mean. Some levels do require a lot of memorization or fine tuning, so you'll wind up having to run them multitudinous times, which can get pretty agravating.\n\nAll said and done, if you like the core concept, striving to improve your scores, and don't mind some particularly tough challenges now and again, then this might be worth your time. For $8 I'd say maybe to most people, but if it's $4 or under, everyone should give it a thought-though don't expect it to blow you away by any measure. 6.5/10","July 5, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
