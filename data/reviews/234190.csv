The great first person shooter takes the handling of your guns unto a whole new level. This very realistic gunplay requires you to know how to handle your pistol knowing each and every step to perform an action. From changing the safety lock, emptying shells, and removing and reloading you magazine, all have their steps that wipes all the realistic shooters into the dust.\n\nBecause of this complex use of guns you will die a lot, pretty often actually. It takes time and effort to put to this game in order to complete. Everytime you die you’ll restart in the beginning of this randomly generated world. If you're not a person of patience then this is not the game for you. As you might start in different places on the map don’t expect to receive the same guns, same ammo, and other equipment like a flashlight. Those and as well as placed items are randomly generated.\n\nThe foes you face in this game are only robots, two kinds stationary sentries, and airborne ones which are equipped with a taser. The lack of variety of enemies can make this came quite boring for some. Knowing how to approach a corner when you hear the beep on a turret or the lights of a flying saucer can make fighting these guys very repetitive.\n\nThe dark, mostly enclosed setting in a tower gives this game a fighting like theme that fits the unknown exploration well. Learning how to conserve your bullets, finding a working flashlight, and collect these tapes that hold a mystery that involves all of mankind really makes it fun for me to play. As playing a easy game is never fun.\n","March 21, 2014","true","0.7"," 89 of 108 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","89","108","0","0"

Gun physics are AWESOME, the backstory is told through tapes which you risk your life to obtain, and the enemies scare the crap out of you, even though they really shouldn't. I love the aspect of the non-automatic reload systems, which this game does quite well. Want to reload your gun? Press at the very least 2 buttons multiple times to do so! Want to have enough magazines so that you don't die from having to reload the same one over and over again? Get the whole "remove mag, place in pouch, take out spare mag, place  in gun, release slide(if needed)" maneuver down! If you wanna play this game, beware that you will die. A lot. The two enemies do well in covering the randomly generated map, and when you encounter your first one, your trigger finger and aiming arm better be accurate! Locational damage plays a big part with your survival, hit a vital system on one of the two enemies and you'll be a happy camper. Er, Receiver. But hit some useless bit of metal, and you're gonna find yourself out of ammunition real soon.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenix_advance/recommended/234190/","phoenix_advance","phoenix_advance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenix_advance/","515 products in account","Receiver is one heck of a free game (was a giveaway). You are placed into a randomly generated texture-less world. Your objective is to collect tapes. You need to shoot or avoid sentry guns (there is only ground and air). It is a one hit kill’s type of FPS game, so it can be challenging.\n\nThe title of the game is somewhat of a pun and has no relation to weapon mechanics. As you collect tapes you hear a recording of a guy’s voice (sounds like Lone Wolf). He tells you the situation of what is going on. The story is freakish in the way that it gives meaning to the texture-less level with basic 3D models that you are strolling through. Each time you die and have to start again, the recordings are played in random order, which means eventually you may have a great understanding of the story even though you have not even made it halfway through the game.\n\nI’ll also quickly mention that the soundtrack also is very fitting and gives an atmosphere to the levels. It reminds me of Islamic prayer type of music sounds like in the film Black Hawk Down.\n\nThe most interesting part of the game is undoubtedly the weapon reload mechanics. The learning curve is not too steep in my opinion. It will help to just crouch down somewhere upon first play and fiddle with the buttons on your keyboard to understand how to reload your gun. There are two different reload mechanics to learn … the semi-automatic pistol (Glock and 1911 if I remember correctly) and the dirty harry revolver.\n\nIt is just cool. I find myself pulling back on the slide to eject the bullets which all go onto the ground. You pick up all the bullets which goes into a reserve (like your pocket). Then you need to put the bullets back into the magazine one by one, but you cannot do that before holstering your weapon (because you need two hands to fill a magazine). Then you need to draw and put the magazine back into the weapon. The first time you pull on the trigger, it may not shoot anything because you need to pull back on the slide again to load a bullet into the chamber. All this is an OCD persons dream come true.\n\nThe magnum revolver is a little simpler. Although you start to notice a difference when running low on bullets, you need to make sure you spin the cylinder to align the bullet filled chambers with the barrel. And because there is less bullets you are always having to pull on the ejector rod.\n\nWith all weapons you have a safety switch which is useless and you can pull back on the hammer for extra readiness. You can also turn on smart tooltips which highlight what you can and cannot do with button presses.\n\nI find the randomly generated levels made more sense compared to say Hellgate: London which did not make sense to me and felt more like a selling point gimmick. There are sections that you will familiarize yourself with. So even if the level is randomly generated, you know what to expect in each section anyways. So that is definitely a positive for a game that could have just been based on a single static level design.\n\nOne thing that I find stupid (and I am not 100% sure about this) is there may be a random luck factor when disabling sentries. It is actually the one thing that has really put me off the game. All sentries supposedly have these weak points. But if you shoot a sentry exactly at a weak point that disables it in one round and then try it again in another round, it will not work. And you can tell because when you get close to the sentry you can see where your bullets have hit exactly. Sometimes you can disable a sentry from a distance that looks like a pea on your screen with one bullet … sometimes you have to fire three shots at a sentry that fills up a quarter of your screen just to disable it. It makes no sense to me. I really hate luck factors in games.\n\nThe last thing I would like to mention is this game could have been great. I mean really big. But it is clearly unfinished and from what I heard was part of a competition in designing a game within a week. The thing this game lacks is arms, hands and textures applied to everything including the weapons. But seriously this game could have been amazing! I can actually visualise many FPS games that could utilize this mechanic. Tom Clancy type of games in particular, but even the Battlefield series. The reason why I mention this is because it is one of those revolutionary ideas that gets put out too quickly and is drowned by games with too common typical boring one button reload mechanics and nothing new (albeit finished). I really do hope to see something better made in the future with this idea … not everyone in the world just wants to gun down stuff on the screen senselessly. This is a needed option!","October 24, 2014","true","5.2"," 52 of 65 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","52","65","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RPINerd/recommended/234190/","RPINerd","RPINerd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RPINerd/","470 products in account","Receiver is a strange little title. I think if you've even heard of the game you know that it was the result of a game jam and was put together in a very short period of time (7 days I believe). These game jams have a knack for putting out some very intriguing concept pieces but understandably lack substance.\nIn a nutshell, this game is a rogue-like first person shooter with absurdly detailed gun mechanics. There is no “Press R to Reload”. First you must eject the magazine or spent casings, you need to reload with fresh ammunition bullet by bullet. Once you reinsert the clip, you can’t pull the trigger and expect a bang without loading one in the chamber and pulling back the hammer.\nWhile I would be outright lying if I tried to argue that Receiver had no lack of substance, the mechanics that are in place are undeniably engaging. My first few runs were rather frustrating but when I finally got a hang of the key mappings and how the different guns operate it was inexplicably rewarding. I felt extremely in touch with whatever gun I had been bestowed and more aware of my use of ammunition than I had ever been with any other FPS.\nThere is certainly no jaw dropping narrative or deep philosophical thesis on the blight of war buried within Receiver, but the depth in which the mechanics of firearms are explored here really shows the possibility of a seriously strategic and skill based first person shooter.","February 9, 2015","true","0.5"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","34","36","0","0"

So far it has too do with some kind of.. war that will happen.\n\nGameplay: Simple and bare with mechanics hardly found anywhere else.\nYou start in a abandoned building with a pistols which ranges from a Colt 1911 pistol, S&W Model 10 "Victory" revolver, and a Glock 10 with full auto mod. Everything is random, your ammo count, placement of ammo, and enemies.\nI should mention that ALL enemies make a sound and lights when they spot you. Therr are only two enemies in the game that I have seen.\n\nEnemy types:\nSentries: are stationary, but once they spot you, they fire at you as you would expect.\n\nDrones: These little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s chase after you once they spot you, choosing to close in at close range to taser you, I have yet to see with with a gun mounted on it.. or destory one.\n\nChallange: Think Dark Souls, but First Person Shooter with mechanics that fit more in a military sim. (Roughly)\n\nReplay ability: This one is a hard one for me, but it does get a bit tedious after a few tries. So it's doesn't have much replay value.\n\n\nVerdict: 8/10 With deep mechanics with the weapon types and detail of how it works.

Problem is, that's not what the game is about. Most of my time in-game is spent wandering around, only to get killed very quickly by a robot.\n\nAnd then there's the random aspects, my biggest gripe. One game I started with no ammunition - at all - and in a hallway guarded by a sentry gun. I couldn't run past it, and I couldn't shoot it - I had no ammo. It brought a quick death. I'm not against random aspects to a game, but there has to be boundaries. Randomly give me between five and fifty bullets. But at least give me one.\n\nPersonally, I don't think the game is worth $5 - I bought it on sale for $2, and I don't think it's worth that.

It gives you full control over weapon operations - you can release the magazine, insert/remove bullets, release the slide lock, toggle the safety, and even use full auto - and it lets you see real gun mechanics at work. It may seem mundane to some but you'll soon find that reloading and operating a virtual firearm becomes mechanical as you play through and is quite satisfying - and it's a lot more interesting than simply pressing R to reload.\n\nThe game itself is surprisingly tense and suspenseful. Because your opposition (turrets and flying stun-drones) can kill you in one hit, you are forced to be practical and careful in your movements and actions. And, as you DO have a task in the game - of collecting 11 cassette tapes that are lying around in various places in the randomly generated world - it's a lot more challenging than you might think!\n\nAll in all - it's an interesting experiment in realism and definitely worth checking out.","June 14, 2013","true","9.7"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","23","30","0","2"

The primary focus is on mastering gun control. This includes ejecting the magazine, filling it with bullets, replacing the magazine, engaging the slide, and turning off the safety so it's ready to fire. It takes some getting used to, but it's not that difficult after a little practice.\n\nThe game part ends up being a permadeath environment where you search for and collect audio tapes while trying to avoid being shot by randomly placed turrets and flying drones. The player spawns with one of three guns that may or may not be ready to fire, a random number of bullets and magazines, and sometimes a flashlight. The one aspect that makes this game engaging is that you always have to be aware of your gun state, especially how many bullets you have in your magazine before you decide to engage a target. Ammunition is scarce making shots that much more valuable. The turrets and drones are quite tough which, combined with the weapon control elements, makes for some very cautious gameplay.\n\nMake no mistake, Receiver is certainly rough around the edges. The environment isn't randomized; only the enemies and audio tape locations. The graphics are not interesting, nor optimized. It feels laggy at times. It can even unfairly spawn you with no gear or in a bad spot. However, it does master the element of weapon handling. It can become quite intense if your magazine runs dry while a drone is hunting you down and you need to pull off a precision reload in the moment. And for that aspect, I give it a thumbs up.","October 3, 2014","true","3.9"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","21","29","0","0"

This would be fine and all, if exploring mechanics did not mean having a horrible atmosphere, incredibly strange controls, and a very unpolished feel.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the guns are good. But there's only 2 of them. I understand that this was originally created for a 7-day game challenge, but I believe Wolfire could have worked on this a bit more to make it complete (oh, and updates are halted indefinately until Overgrowth, which has been in development for 4+ years, is out).\n\nThe environments are randomly generated but you will see the same rooms put carelessly next to eachother over and over again. And I know that there are some things that can be considered the "art style" but almost every room has the same bland, unfinished texture for both the floor and walls. What gives?\n\nFinally there are the controls. It would be nice to really explore gun mechanics if I was able to use them easily. For Christ's sake, there are 2 different buttons to take out the magazine and put it back in. If you get back in the game after a break, you're going to have no clue what in the world you're doing, so you'll mercilessly slap your keyboard and memorize controls that should just be common sense.\n\nThere are also 2 types of enemies. One is a turret and the other is some sort of flying robot that doesn't detect half of your shots and sometimes gives the impression that it is disabled when it really isn't.\n\nIt's bland, it's boring, it's unresponsive, it makes no sense, and it won't change for a while.","December 27, 2013","false","3.2"," 35 of 57 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","35","57","0","2"

Rather than your standard run and gun gameplay most FPS features, Receiver is much more deliberate where the focus isn't just on the shooting, but also on the gun itself.\n\nIn Receiver you must manage every part of the gun, the slider, the hammer, the magazine, it's chamber, etc. If you don't take care of your gun, or understand how each part functions you will die... a lot. The game does a good job at simulating what it takes to handle a real gun. Due to it's vast amount of controls there is a definite learning curve with this game. It will not play like other FPSs you've played previously.\n\nThe game is only $5usd, which isn't asking for a lot, but do know there are limited amounts of options, features, and content. There is only one play mode, only 2 types of enemies, and not much in the way of customization. Although the game does it's best to incentivize reply with it's procedurally generated maps, enemies, and load out, and each play through will be different from the last, but it will be "different" with a lot of very familiar assets.\n\nCertainly the game is challenging, and at first may even be frustrating to some, but it's also very rewarding. Once you manage to get over the difficulty and control hump, the game will feel like none other you've played. Each kill feels like a huge victory, and the game does a good job at instilling a legitimate sense of tension and danger around every corner.\n\nOverall Receiver is a quality product at a low price point. The content might be limited, but through the creativity of it's mechanics, there are also endless possibilities to play through.\n\nPros:\n- Procedurally generated maps and load out offers endless play potential\n- Very unique mechanics and concept\n- Best gun simulation I've played (only gun simulation I've played?)\n- Challenging\n- Very fair price\n\nCons:\n- Limited content\n- Moderate visuals\n- Large learning curve","January 10, 2015","true","3.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The sales pitch is quick to warn upfront, almost apologetically, that the game is critically underdeveloped. While this may help temper user expectations, it doesn't excuse fundamental design flaws.\n\nThe game embraces a "monkeys and typewriters" philosophy of level design, placing the items and enemies in each playthrough entirely at random. In practice, this flavors the gameplay with a sort of anti-design. You will search chains of seemingly empty rooms only to learn that they were indeed empty. You will find the game's rare collectible items lying unprotected in the middle of your path. You will risk your life and dip into your scarce ammunition supply to defeat fierce groups of enemies, only to discover that they were guarding nothing. And when you die, the level is discarded - along with all of the effort you wasted exploring it. The game's antagonist shifts from the killer robots to the secret behind-the-scenes dice rolling machine. I've never felt burned out playing a video game so quickly.\n\nIf the authors had created and playtested a small set of predesigned enemy/item layouts rather than spend time developing the procedural generation system, the pacing and fun of the gameplay experience would improve tenfold. Players would face a consistent, fair set of challenges with steadily increasing difficulty and a way to mentally benchmark how their skills progress. Beating the game would become a well-defined and measurable goal instead of a tedious series of gambles. In fact, such a game could in all likelihood fly straight to the top of my favorites. Unfortunately, that's not the direction the developers chose.\n\nIf the simulation aspect interests you above all else, Receiver may be worth the buy. But judging it as a video game, the procedural generator drags the gameplay down so heavily that I can't recommend it.","May 14","false","5.8"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

I also feel that this game deserves some credit due to the little amount of time it was issued for it to be produced, there a re three weapons including a colt m.1911, some form of the automatic glock series (i'm gonna guess a G17) and finally the classic colt revolver (I cant put a finger on the exact model). I personally also feel that a full game would be downright awesome, hopefully including something else than just pistols (assault rifles, shotgun etc.) This game actually ends to give a sort of tactical feel as well as a form of rage inducing. The "rage" (more annoying) is the F***ING flying tasers are incredibly hard to hit however not impossible (i personally think that they fit perfectly into the game). The other understandable point that is still annoying is that whenever you die, you start all over. Once again, I feel that this an understandable piece of the game and is completely rational, however it is still annoying.\n\nAll in all I feel that this would be an amazing full game and is still a great game as the "competition edition" (the thing that it is right now)\n9/10","May 20, 2015","true","33.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Minimalist, beautiful, hard, mesmeric. Utterly recommended.\n\n----\n\nNow more detail: Receiver is a minimalist and realistic FPS. The game features 3 different models of guns: a S&W Model 10, a Colt M1911, or a Glock 17. It also features procedural levels (generated from patterns), and randomized placement for enemies (of which I've seen two different types, so far), items and objectives. That way, you never get the same experience twice. In addition, you spawn with a random selection of items, which can make the game difficulty range from moderately easy to very hard, depending on what you get.\n\nThe idea behind the game is to be as close to a realistic gun handling experience as it is possible with a keyboard and mouse. It means that the game maps to the keyboard/mouse a lot more interactions with the gun than existing titles, and also, does so with much greater details than usual FPSes. In addition, the difference in the power of each gun is very noticable, making the experience feel even more authentic.\n\nA must have.","December 25, 2014","true","8.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

But all I can say is "GET THIS GAME"\n\nnow as for the firearms, stated earlier I am a firearms collector and had some pretty interesting addition ideas.\n\n1: Polish P63 Makarov\n\nThe P63 is a polish knock off makarov that fires the standard Makarov 9x18mm cartrage, it's slightly less powerful then a glock, but it's very slim, has an excellent sight picture, and is not prone to jamming.   It can make for an excellent concieled carry firearm and is readily available on the market for 150 dollars.\n\n2: Hi-Point .40 S&W\n\nHi-Point is another company for people on a budget, but what they build really hits a mark.  The .40 S&W cartrage is a mix between a .45 and 10mm, giving you the power of a .45 and the accuricy/mag count of a 10mm.  Why a high point?  Because we should all give some oddball guns some love.\n\n3:  Mauser C96 Broomhandle\n\nThis would be a good fully/semi automatic model to add to the game for a few reasons:\n1: it's gorgous\n2: It's full auto and semi auto\n3:It uses a stripper clip, and I feel you should add some of the more awkward loading mechanisms to the game\n4: It's gorgous... need I say more?\n\nPlease consider these firearms.

Tis a weird little game with a bunch of cool features. Aight, we're gonna hafta split this up into pieces.\n\nSTORY: The story of Receiver is similar to the first Hotline Miami in that the exposition is delivered in cutscenes in the form of various cassette tapes you find and have to play to finish the game. The story is that you are a Receiver, a survivor of the Mindkill event, an event that wipes the life off of the world you're on. Done by machines who had begun controlling the world, you are tasked to find all 11 cassette tapes and ascent to The World Not Filled With Turrets and Flying Tasers all the while dealing with the fact said machines are dropping in sentry guns and taser drones that can both drop your ♥♥♥ in 1 hit.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Gameplay in Receiver is the most interesting. It is similar to realistic shooters such as say Red Orchestra 2, Project Reality and so on. You get one of three guns, a Colt M1911A1, A S&W Model 10 "Victory" revolver and a modified Glock 17 each with their own specialties, the Glock can fire in full auto, the Model 10 can be fired in single and double action and so on and so forth. Also different in Receiver is that you have to do many things via key presses, ranging from loading individual rounds into gun magazines, releasing slides, using the ejector rod in the Model 10 and so on. It seems complex at the beginning but become almost instictive after an hour or two.\n\nENEMIES: As I said earlier, the enemies in the game are very basic, one is a sentry turret, the other a drone with a taser, or the ATF Special. Both of these are different as if you shoot specific parts of them, they do more damage. You can disable sentries by either shooting the CPU off to break it, disable it's battery or break the camera. As for the tazer bots, shoot it repeatedly, cause they're more annoying than the tazers in PAYDAY 2.\n\nIS IT WORTH IT?: The gameplay is rather solid and the gunplay is fun as well as realistic, and it sits at a nice $5 dollars. If you feel like spending $5 dollars on a small FPS then go ahead, if not, wait for a sale and nab it for cheaper.","August 23, 2015","true","5.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You will hate it and love it at the same time.\nYou play an unnamed protagonist navigating through various indoor and outdoor areas in a structure located in an unnamed city. Many of the rooms are guarded by randomly-placed sentry turrets that shot you on sight, or helicopter/taser sentries that fly at you when you are detected.\n\nYou come armed with one of three different handguns, all of which are nicely-rendered. Each one is operated in a realistic-manner that may be off--putting to the gamer used to relading by simply pressing the R key. In this game, reloading could involve five distinctly-different operations, depending on the gun you happen to have on you at the time.  The sound effects of the guns are nice, and have an authentic feel to them.\n\nThe environments you travel around in are randomly assembled, and comprised of flat-shaded textures and occasional lights. The assembly of the rooms means that you occasionally find passages to nowhere, but that doesn't really detract from gameplay. Repetition is high, and some of the rooms/areas are confusing, but since you are just passing through, it's not really a big deal. Your goal is to locate ammo and tapes, and the threats are there to stop you.\n\nAudio is pretty good, with a couple of notable exceptions:\n1: the helicopter sentries are loud enough to be heard from one room over, but it becomes difficult to pin down their locations based on the audio alone.\n\n2: The sentry turrets also make sounds while they rotate, but you can't hear them until you're almost right on top of them. Their sounds, as well as the helicopters,  also pass through walls/floors at the same volume level. This aspect of the game is bothersome if you are searching a room. I prefer to play the game with the music silenced so I can try to hear the threats before they spot me, and often I find that I am shot dead before ever hearing the servo motor of the turret that nailed me.\n\n3: The audio tapes are well-voiced, but remind me a lot of the sort of thing you might find on a webiste run by fringe-science/conspiracy theorists. After playing for a few hours, I completly silenced the tapes because I became bothered at having to hear them over and over again. Kudos to the devs for allowing this option in the settings.\n\nThe main goal of the game is to find all 11 tapes, and "absorb" them by listening. Listening occurs while you continue exploring, so that's a good thing. I did find a couple of small problems with the exploration/survival aspect:\n\n1: Sometimes the game allows you to access an area that does not have an exit. The only option is to exit and restart.\n2: You are assigned a random firearm and random loadout upon starting. Rarely, you will find yourself without enough ammo to eliminate enough of the threats to be able to find more.\n3: (Extremely rare) you begin the game in the direct line of site of a threat, and get killed immediately.\n\n\nFor a game created in a week as part of a contest, the developers have done an admirable job! The simplicity of the design and the addictiveness of the concept keeps me coming back over and over again. I've only managed to get as high as 4 tapes before being mowed down by a threat in a moment of complacency. The game forces you to be on high-alert at all times, and punishes relaxed attitudes brutally. You will learn to use expletives effectively, I guarantee.\n\nWorth every bit of the 5 bucks it currently is. Get it. You'll be glad you did.","September 24, 2014","true","51.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

One of the tightest FPS experiences I've everplayed.\n\nPremise of the game is simple--you're dumped into a kind of 'dream world', and you need to recover a series of tapes to 'wake up' (think The Matrix meets Videodrome meets Vanilla Sky. Or something.)\n\nYou're moving through a series of what are, apparently, interconnected apartment buildings, each with multiple floors that connect across. There are enemies scattered throughout, but only two types: flying kill drones, and turrets. Kill drones will fly straight for you and electrocute you at close range, turrets will shoot a spray of bullets at you from afar.\n\nSo far, so generic, and a lot less content than most FPS. So why play?\n\nWell, what makes the game work so well are the detailed mechanics.\n\nFirst off, if you're struck even once, or fall, that's it--you're dead. Going gun blazing into a room is pretty much game over.\n\nSecond, you control every mechanic of your gun with a separate keyboard key. Just arming and firing your weapon will take you a few playthroughs to learn, but when you do--it's amazing how rewarding your actions feel.\n\nThird, running requires that you 'tap' the forward key, lending a neat kinetic element to the game.\n\nFourth, ammo is scarce, and you'll have to selectively choose which fights you want to engage in... and which to bypass or run for it.\n\nDespite the sparse world and somewhat rudimentary graphics, sound design and aesthetics are brilliant, and I haven't been so kinetically into a game since the days of Atari 2600. Bravo!\n\nIt's hard to explain the culmination of all of the above elements; you'll simply have to try it out for yourself. It's unlike any oher FPS and revolutionary at what it does. I guess I would call Receiver the 'thinking man's shooter'.\n\nIt's terrific; buy it, then go yell at the devs to show it a little love and update it rather than spending all their time making rabbit-fighting games.","July 21, 2013","true","30.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The amount of rounds a player carries shows up as a number in the interface, and reloading requires nothing more than tapping a button. Actually handling and managing the bullets that go into a gun is a complex task, however. Receiver, an first-person shooter (FPS) from Wolfire Games, wants to remind us of that fact. Unfortunately, it never makes it clear why we should care.\n\nReceiver drops the player into a randomly-generated set of rooftop rooms and tasks him with recovering 11 tapes of droning narration (without subtitles) and that explain the game's story. The player begins with an unpredictable loadout including one handgun in one of various states and some ammunition. The player may also start with a flashlight or, if his gun is semi-automatic, a spare magazine or two. He must then move through the multi-tiered linear world looking for the tapes, which can be frustrating since one can go through at least nine rooms in a row without encountering a single one. I myself haven't managed to get all 11 in a single playthrough before dying.\n\nThe game only has two kinds of enemies: a stationary gun turret and a flying drone, both of which can kill the player with a single hit. Each has some associated visual cues, but most of the time the player will need to hear their alert chirps to know when he's been spotted and when it's safe to move. The distribution of enemies changes, and on rare occasions they can be avoided. Because enemies are difficult to evade and pickups can be hard to see, however, killing everything in a room is generally the only option.\n\nReceiver started as a response to a seven-day FPS challenge and definitely feels like it, from its spare graphics to its room-entry stutter. The hook for the game is that it presents the process of actually reloading the firearm in a significant level of detail. The HUD has no ammo count, and bullets do not magically fly from the corpses of your enemies into magazines the player can swap out every time he takes a breath. Rounds must be gathered manually and loaded into magazines by hand, with the gun safely tucked away. If there's no spare magazine, the player has to eject the empty, refill it, then shove it back home again. The only way to know the number of bullets remaining is to remember how many have been fired or check by eye.\n\nReceiver fails to establish that the complexity of gun handling matters. The detailed reloading scheme doesn't speak to the story, the aesthetic, or the other mechanics. Receiver doesn't treat aiming or shooting the weapon with the same carefulness it reserves for reloading, and doesn't fiddle much with the basics of movement, yet running and shooting are the core verbs of the game. By making the world randomly generated, the developers give up the opportunity to design encounters where efficient reloading matters. As a consequence, becoming more skilled with the game's most intricate systems doesn't make a player any more likely to succeed. Receiver's complex gun-handling mechanics are irrelevant in the context of its larger design.\n\nThat's a shame, because the larger design has nothing to recommend it. The perfunctory story and low-poly world of Receiver aren't interesting to explore in their own right, much less when one must overcome the game's unforgiving difficulty. The choice to generate the world randomly might add replay value, but it also adds much to the frustration level while costing the game the ability to present rewarding encounters that highlight its unique mechanics. Receiver has a neat idea at its core, but that didn't translate into an interesting game.\n\nFinal Score:  3.5\n4 /10","September 30, 2014","false","10.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You're going to check corners, sprint erratically (none of that 360 no scope ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t), and will start praying that the next set of rooms you encounter will have more bullets or clips. You can die from fall damage, you will risk falling to make a running leap for those bullets. You will crouch around corners to kill those turrets with three shots to their base. You will dip around corners to try and take out their sensors to save those precious rounds for later.  Those bullets are all that stand between you and oblivion at the hands of the enemy. Your psychic powers will make them glow like manna from heaven. You will take every spare second to load every spare bullet into a clip. After every engagement, you will check your gun and your ammo and make sure you don't spend the last free moments of your miserable existence frantically trying to load bullets in a clip while a hovedrone closes in for the kill on your enormous head.\n\nYou are also going to fail, a lot.  But many of you like that, and it can be very satisfying to clear half a level only to fail in a hail of gun fire or miss that ledge for those precious shiny bullets.\n\n\nThis game was developed for the 7 day FPS challenge and is the most streamlined experience for the FPS genre I have ever played. I have never beaten it, and I will never care. It is the thrill of dropping a hover drone from beyond its range, the joy in disabling a turret in a single shot, the chill of creeping into a new area and seeing the blue grid shine out from its sensors.\n\nThis is a gameplay experienced refined to its purity.  I would enjoy an open world survival game based on these gunporn mechanics, if it played as smooth as this.","April 15","true","11.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

Your weapon and ammo is also random, sometimes you can have a 9mm pistoll with 3 full clips, other times you can have a revolver with 5 bullets.\n\nEach piece of the gun has its own button, so if you want to reload your revolveryou need to open it, then shake it down to take out the bullets, reload it bullet bullet by bullet and then closing it. Pistols in the other hand are faster to reload, but you need to reload the mags before using them, and to make it you have to put your gun out of your hands. This makes reloading be a pain in the ♥♥♥, rewarding and very tense at the same time, depends on the person.\n\nAlso, enemies which are only 2, can be damage in multiple ways, like the turrets which keeping scanning the map, you can shoot the camera and make it blind, you can shoot it's base and lock it facing one direction, or you can shoot the support of it and make it be facing the ground.\n\nIt's a fun litle game, if you want an fps with doesn't hold your hand in any way and make your bullets really count, you can take a few hours of enjoying out of it ^_^.","September 25, 2014","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With the constant fear of turrets and flying drones ready to kill you in a single shot, and the multitude of keys required to handle and operate your firearm, this game will have your palms sweating after a few seconds.\n\nOne hit, one kill, is what you'll learn all of the "bad guys" in this game deal. If you get hit by a bullet, or tazed by the drones, you're down for the count. Which is great, you have to be much more tactful in your efforts to solve the puzzle of this game. But ammo is often scarce, and danger looms around every corner. Match that with the creepily monotone voice of the man on the recordings guiding you through this Mind Kill event, and you have yourself a very intense journey through an every changing maze.\n\nThis game is awesome, but be prepared to lose your mind when you forget how to reload, or unknowingly step into the sights of a turret.

The mechanics are exciting, the Killdrones definitely live up to their names, and one singular mod has made this game better than base. I highly recommend that you mod this game with the mod that adds guns like the Mauser C96, the Tokarev TT33, and the Remington 870.\n\nNow, the game dips quite a bit on optimization; you can only run it smoothly on fastest/640x480 video settings, but it still is good enough. As the game generates nearby rooms, it also can lag up and make it troublesome to kill that one drone that saw you enter but you can't see hurtling towards you. It also dips in vanilla choices and the game seems very incomplete without textures to cover the blank walls and only 3 guns.\n\nThe story behind the game is what you take from it, but I'll let you in on what I took from it.\nYou have survived a great cataclysm called the Mindkill, which was an attempt at shutting down your brain with propaganda and media corruption. A receiver is a person who can turn around the negative effects of the Mindkill, with the help of a set of Cassettes called "Clear Tapes" to jog your mental capacity and remain on point. The killdrones and sentry drones are dreamed in to stop you from collecting all the tapes, to become awakened, and to stride carefree and conscious. While one can dream endlessly on, it takes one with true enlightenment to break free from the tyranny and claim their mind as their own.\nHeheh, I probably botched that up hardcore.\n\nThis game gets a 8/10, with a WHOLE lotta room for improvement and even more potential. It's style is addicting and very enjoyable. Absolutely worth the price.","May 12, 2014","true","18.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love the gun handling mechanics and its absolutely worth playing just for that. Once you've begun to master the mechanics of handling and reloading the different guns, it really is enjoyable. It feels rewarding to get proficient with each weapon. I wish someone would take this concept (of micromanaging reloads and gun handling) into a more playable more polished concept. As for Receiver, yes you can put a few hours into it, but ultimately it's too frustrating. There are only 2 types of enemies, some are too easy and some are nearly impossible. The stationary drones just spin in place, telgraphing their movements and give you plenty of time to shoot them with well timed and aimed shots. The aerial drones, which I refer to as "Flying F!@#s" are impossible. There is just no way to see them (all) in time and they are just too fast, some rooms will spawn 4 or 5 of them. Your field of view is too small to see them and they are just way too fast and maneuverable. I think they were supposed to be an enemy who would force you to rapid reload under pressure, but in practice they either don't detect you and drop with one shot, or you empty your mag on one while the other one zaps you from behind. I really do like playing this, but its not developed to a stage where you'd really want to try and "play through" to the end (believe me I've tried). From the enthusiasm of the "tapes" I can't imagine the ending being very rewarding anyway.","March 31","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You might think.\nOkay. You are part of many more other Receivers that dead-dropped cassette tapes all over the place  and you have to pick them up because save the trees.  and you are tasked to listen to the tapes in an unordered fashion to uncover the truth of what happened.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are simple and complex at the same time. You are given 1 of 3 guns.\nThe guns in the game are:\n-Glock 18\n-Colt 1911\n-S&W Model 10 "Victory"\nThe tapes were NOT updated when the Glock and the S&W were added, so one of the tapes still considers your weapon to ALWAYS be the 1911.\nAll weapons have realistic ballistics. (AKA bullets fly and ricochet like IRL)\n\nAgain, you might be thinking "So what?"\nWell, I'll tell you what. You have to operate specific parts of the gun to be able to even fire a single bullet.\nOkay, it's not that complicated.\nFor example, the slide, slide release and hammer are different buttons that you have to press to use the gun.\nYou heard that right, kids. The old days of pressing 'R' to reload are over.\n\nAfter a while of figuring out the controls  and dropping all of your magazines  you then have to pick up tapes.\nYes, remember back at the start of the guide? TAPES. But to do that, you have to overcome...\nENEMIES\nThere are 2 enemy types in the game.  Both are referred to as 'killdrones' on the tapes.\n-Turret (Your ordinary stationary turret that swivels and shoots many bullets into you)\n-Stun Drone (Basically an automated helicopter with a very painful stun gun on it)\nThe catch is that the enemies all have very similar parts, in which way you are able to destroy them.\nFor example, you can put one bullet into the battery and have it dead, or shoot it's main weapon and risk missing and then getting shocked or/and shot.\n\nAfter you recover all of the tapes, you awaken. From what? When did you fall 'asleep'?

The real attraction here is the gameplay.\n\nIt is unique in that I have never before seen an fps that goes into such detail with the gun mechanics. There are lots of controls to learn, so you may find yourself with the help menu open for a while. However, as you become accustomed to the game you begin to learn the controls, making the game more fast paced.\n\nThe aim of the game is to locate randomly scattered tapes that tell the story, while avoiding enemies. This game can be hard to get into because the enemies operate on a one-hit-kill basis, but that is again quite refreshing in a world where many games let you take entire clips of ammo straight to the chest, only to auto-recover health after a few seconds.\n\nThis is also a perma-death fps. You get killed, you have to start collecting tapes from scratch. You are also assigned a weapon randomly each time you spawn into a world. This can get a bit annoying, but it is all part of the challenge.\n\nIf you're a gun fanatic, I can't vouch for the accuracy of the game, but you may enjoy this, as well as any fans of both difficult rogue-likes and fps games.","April 29, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You might think.\nOkay. You are part of many more other Receivers that dead-dropped cassette tapes all over the place  and you have to pick them up because save the trees.  and you are tasked to listen to the tapes in an unordered fashion to uncover the truth of what happened.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are simple and complex at the same time. You are given 1 of 3 guns.\nThe guns in the game are:\n-Glock 18\n-Colt 1911\n-S&W Model 10 "Victory"\nThe tapes were NOT updated when the Glock and the S&W were added, so one of the tapes still considers your weapon to ALWAYS be the 1911.\nAll weapons have realistic ballistics. (AKA bullets fly and ricochet like IRL)\n\nAgain, you might be thinking "So what?"\nWell, I'll tell you what. You have to operate specific parts of the gun to be able to even fire a single bullet.\nOkay, it's not that complicated.\nFor example, the slide, slide release and hammer are different buttons that you have to press to use the gun.\nYou heard that right, kids. The old days of pressing 'R' to reload are over.\n\nAfter a while of figuring out the controls  and dropping all of your magazines  you then have to pick up tapes.\nYes, remember back at the start of the guide? TAPES. But to do that, you have to overcome...\nENEMIES\nThere are 2 enemy types in the game.  Both are referred to as 'killdrones' on the tapes.\n-Turret (Your ordinary stationary turret that swivels and shoots many bullets into you)\n-Stun Drone (Basically an automated helicopter with a very painful stun gun on it)\nThe catch is that the enemies all have very similar parts, in which way you are able to destroy them.\nFor example, you can put one bullet into the battery and have it dead, or shoot it's main weapon and risk missing and then getting shocked or/and shot.\n\nAfter you recover all of the tapes, you awaken. From what? When did you fall 'asleep'? Play the game and find out.\n\n8/10 Great storyline, great gameplay, OK visuals.","September 19, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The mechanics are exciting, the Killdrones definitely live up to their names, and one singular mod has made this game better than base. I highly recommend that you mod this game with the mod that adds guns like the Mauser C96, the Tokarev TT33, and the Remington 870.\n\nNow, the game dips quite a bit on optimization; you can only run it smoothly on fastest/640x480 video settings, but it still is good enough. As the game generates nearby rooms, it also can lag up and make it troublesome to kill that one drone that saw you enter but you can't see hurtling towards you. It also dips in vanilla choices and the game seems very incomplete without textures to cover the blank walls and only 3 guns.\n\nThe story behind the game is what you take from it, but I'll let you in on what I took from it.\nYou have survived a great cataclysm called the Mindkill, which was an attempt at shutting down your brain with propaganda and media corruption. A receiver is a person who can turn around the negative effects of the Mindkill, with the help of a set of Cassettes called "Clear Tapes" to jog your mental capacity and remain on point. The killdrones and sentry drones are dreamed in to stop you from collecting all the tapes, to become awakened, and to stride carefree and conscious. While one can dream endlessly on, it takes one with true enlightenment to break free from the tyranny and claim their mind as their own.\nHeheh, I probably botched that up hardcore.\n\nThis game gets a 8/10, with a WHOLE lotta room for improvement and even more potential. It's style is addicting and very enjoyable. Absolutely worth the price.","May 12, 2014","true","18.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I know.\nThe game is all poligonal and things like that.\nBut is been made in 7 Days.\nAnd it remembers a lot the old days in the 90s.\n\nAbout the price.\nI can say that is not pretty good, just because 5 bucks for this game i think is too much for the people that watched a lot of games at that price.\n\nIf you don't like games like this, don't spend 5 bucks on it, just wait for the sales and spend 1 dollar for it.\nIs pretty worth it, and i hope you will understand that this game can be very good if you think about it.\n\nIs not good for the people that likes FPS games, shooting everything and everyone you see.\nYou have to stay calm and relax for doing this and win, if you freak out, you die.\n\nAt the end, i suggest you to buy it in the sales.\n\nHave a good one!\n\nP.S. = You will die in just one shot, good luck.","September 28, 2014","true","34.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Instead of simply pressing "R" to reload a weapon, there is a specific key that is pressed for every step of the reloading process (Removing mag, adding bullets to mag, inserting mag, cocking weapon, etc.).\n- Your two enemies, Bots and Turrets, both have various hit boxes that, when shot, provide different effects. Turrets, For example, spin around in a circle scanning for the player, and if you fall inside of their sweeping scanner's view, they will fire on you. So shooting a turret in a certian spot may prevent it from spinning, but leave its gun fully operational, and able to shoot you if you walk in front of it; while shooting another location may leave the scanner untouched but render the gun itself useless.\n- 3 or 4 different guns to choose from that all have different mechanics, strategies, strengths, and weaknesses.\n- Maps are randomly generated.\n\nCons:\n- The game is very repetitive. As your goal is always the same: gather the tapes.\n- Graphics are awkwardly ugly\n- Lack of enemies/weapons\n- Slight learning curve for gun mechanics.\n\nOverall, keeping the $5 price tag in mind, I give this a 8/10. Honestly I would say it's worth grabbing for the $5 tag if you can get it.","January 10, 2015","true","2.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The plot of the game is you are what is known as a "receiver" and you exsist in what people call "Reality B." Receiver is known as a rouge game, meaning everytime you die, you take a new body, the rooms are connected in a different order, to top it all off, you start off with a new gun in a different state, maybe even a flashlight. The guns you could receive (no pun intended) in the game are either a Colt M1911A1, a Smith and Wesson Model 10, or a Glock 17 with a full auto mode. It tries to potray a "realistic gun" in a way (seeing how the graphics are pretty basic); you can manipulate every part of the gun, from safety to pulling the slide half way to check for a chambered bullet. The enemies are what the game calls Killdrones: An flying one with a stun gun on it, and a basic turret. What sucks about the game is how one hit means death. (Hex, Remember to write a transition between death and goal, -Hex.) The objective of the game is to "absorb" 11 tapes holding information about the world around you.

As such, the visually bare environment really suits it.  Much more would be less--the game is a work of art in its own right.  The premises and specifics of the storyline are New-Agey (and therefore pretentious, if not ridiculous), but they do provide a context for playing and winning the game.  The ending kinda sucks, but it's really about the journey.\n\nThe game is challenging.  Ammunition tends to be very limited, especially for the Colt 1911.  It only takes one shot to take you down, but depending upon your shot placement, several rounds may be required to take down a drone or turret.  Player character seems to have brittle bones disease.  If you fall or jump more than a few feet down, you will die. There are no checkpoints or saves. When you die, you have to start all over again in a new, "randomly" generated map, with a "random" loadout of equipment.   You will probably die numerous times before you actually finish the game.   Most of those times, you will probably feel stupid.  Other times, you will be completely out of ammunition, having started with little, having found little, having used what you had efficiently, and having died trying to get more.\n\nGame actually succeeded tricked me into listening to recordings of the same  of asinine drivel over and over again, while I thought I was having fun.

Instead of simply pressing "R" to reload a weapon, there is a specific key that is pressed for every step of the reloading process (Removing mag, adding bullets to mag, inserting mag, cocking weapon, etc.).\n- Your two enemies, Bots and Turrets, both have various hit boxes that, when shot, provide different effects. Turrets, For example, spin around in a circle scanning for the player, and if you fall inside of their sweeping scanner's view, they will fire on you. So shooting a turret in a certian spot may prevent it from spinning, but leave its gun fully operational, and able to shoot you if you walk in front of it; while shooting another location may leave the scanner untouched but render the gun itself useless.\n- 3 or 4 different guns to choose from that all have different mechanics, strategies, strengths, and weaknesses.\n- Maps are randomly generated.\n\nCons:\n- The game is very repetitive. As your goal is always the same: gather the tapes.\n- Graphics are awkwardly ugly\n- Lack of enemies/weapons\n- Slight learning curve for gun mechanics.\n\nOverall, keeping the $5 price tag in mind, I give this a 8/10. Honestly I would say it's worth grabbing for the $5 tag if you can get it.","January 10, 2015","true","2.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Pretty much the only thing lacking in it is jamming, but you're talking about the M1911A1, Glock, and a revolver. S&M Model 10 or something like that. .38 Spl.  Not a whole lot of jamming to be found there, however it does happen on the rare occasion. There are the scatter complaint I have about this game, but a lot of positive aspects to point out as well, let's start with them.\n\nFirst off; individual magazine, not an ammo pool. LOVE it! Ability to manually remove ammo from a magazine, or load ammo into a mag. That's a first for me in a videogame, and it's outstanding. Ability to activate safety on an M1911A1, love the realism, however it should NOT be able to be activated when the hammer is decocked. I own a Springfield Armory 2008 M1911A1 Mil Spec, and it cannot be put on safe unless it is cocked.\n\nSelect fire on Glock 18. Now I don't like that they chose the Glock 18 because it's very rare for gun owners to ever handle one, however at the same time I'm glad they implimented it; it's almost useless in full auto, wastes ammo faster than you can say 'yeehaw', and will do more missing than hitting on anything beyond 10m. That's good, it shows people realism. Many people love the G18 because "Full auto pistol! 1337!" No, full auto is pretty much useless on a pistol unless it's got a stock on it. Even then, it will still eat up ammo insanely fast. Keep it on semi auto, or you won't last very long. Ultimately, I think it would have been better if they chose Glock 17 or Glock 22 (.40 S&W), but I love that they at least made it realistic!\n\nYou can also go magazine +1 (M1911A1 has 7 round mags (Even though 8 round mags are more common nowadays but I digress) so you can have a full 7 round mag, +1 in the chamber making a total of 8. Or with Glock 18 with 17 round mag, have than +1 in the chamber and you have 18 rounds before having to reload!) It's also cool being able to spin the cylinder of that .38 revolver. Load just one round, spin it, and play Russian Roulette. Will you have a live round, or an empty chamber? :o\n\nI think now I'll touch on the bad aspects; as said, M1911A1 shouldn't be able to be on safe while hammer is cocked. Also, for some reason, when you have a full mag loaded, with the slide locked back, if you press the 'pull slide' button or whatever it's called, then a round will eject. If you choose the 'slide release' button or whatever it's called in the game, then you will simply chamber a round. Realistically, either should be able to be used without a live round leaping out of the chamber.\n\nI think that's about all I have to say about the game other than the obvious; obvious to just about anyone who played it anyways... ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ FLIERS! You'll see what I mean, they have to do something about them. SO annoying! Anyways, I hope they continue to develop this game, and come to include the ability to find more mags, use more firearms (More than one if you're lucky enough to find another firearm), ability to choose difficulty (I WANT TO PLAY WITHOUT THOSE DAMN FLIERS!), and if at all possible, please develop some rifles, as well as potential long distance shooting with adjustable sights!\n\nDon't stop now that you have a (Albeit kind of simple beyond the controls) revolutionary game made; keep going! Try making a more in depth story line! Character creater! Inventory! Weight management! Perhaps leveling up because I know from experience that it takes time and practice to become an accurate shot! How about long-term gaming? Hunger, thirst, oh and don't forget about different types of ammo! 9mm isn't much use when all you have is an M1911A1 and an SKS (Just throwing an idea out there for potential rifles/carbines that could be found!) :) To a bright future for this futuristically realistic game!

When you first jump into the game you'll find yourself armed with one of three different handguns, a variety of bullets and/or magazines, and, if you're lucky, a flashlight. This is one of the key features of Receiver - everything is random. Your loadout, the layout of the world, items in the world - just about everything is random in every playthrough (and trust me, you'll be playing through a lot). There's also perma-death - when you're shot (or tazed) by the automated turrets and shock-drones, you're down for the count and thrown into a new world with a new loadout head-first.\n\nBut even with these different mechanics, what makes Receiver all that interesting if you just get three guns and a flashlight? That would be the five or so different buttons needed to reload. In Receiver, you don't just hit 'R' to slap another mag in, you manually pull the empty magazine out with 'E', holster your gun with '~', slot any spare bullets you have into the magazine with 'Z', draw your gun again, hit 'Z' again to slam the magazine in, and hold 'R' for a second to chamber a round. There are a couple other buttons to do a few extra things, too, and each gun has it's own reloading mechanics (these controls being for the Colt 1911. There's a simpler S&W Revolver and Glock 17 available).\n\nWhile these controls sound unnecessarily clunky, and I can't say they're realistic, it adds a new horror to your gun going 'click' while an enemy is charging you. You don't wait a couple seconds for the gun to auto-reload - you have to keep a clear head and go through each step of the process. Which is why you end up respawning a lot, unless you pause for a minute and drill yourself in the reloading process. This is the key feature of the game, and much more interesting (not to mention satisfying) than it sounds. And, come on, the game's only five bucks without a sale, and if you pre-order Overgrowth (which is a great game) you get this for absolutely free. You (hopefully) won't regret it :P","January 24, 2014","true","26.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Basically, you walk around getting casette tapes where then a man narrates some gibberish, giving context to the scenario, a la Bioshock. But the difference here is that Receiver is trying to simulate using a gun via keyboard and mouse by forcing you to press something like four different keys just to eject the forking ammo. And while trying to listen to the tapes while walking around the single, randomly generated level, you'll probably get shot by a turret and die.\n\nSpeaking of the randomly generated level, it's aesthetically awkward. It' one kind of big level where you randomly respawn after dying so many times and you don't retain your tapes. So when the motion and visual detecting turrets gun you down over and over again, don't blame yourself.\n\n6.0/10","September 17, 2014","false","0.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

That was a damn good game.\n\nThe core concept of the game is, "What if using a gun in an FPS was as complicated a process as it is in real life?" and that boils down to each little part of the gun having it's own button associated with it. You don't just tap the R button and watch a cool little animation and then be on your way, you have to do all the little things required and in the right order as your situation dictates. At the start you will fumble around with the gun functions and may not even figure out how to shoot for quite a while. Then after a few minutes you may start to get the hang of it, albeit taking your time between shots. After a few hours of playing you will really get the hang of things and reloading will be like clockwork.\n\nEven the enemies, which are little robots, have a similar complexity to them. They don't just have an HP bar that empties out after a few shots. You have to hit them in very specific parts to disable certain functions of them until you can safely pass by. It's up to you to learn where your shots count the most for disabling them.\n\nThe world is rather bland, however, and consists of a bunch of randomly generated rooms in sequence. You will get very used to these room as there is very little variety between them. You will figure out pretty quickly where the ammo drops can be and where the robots can be placed in certain rooms. It's the only real flaw in the game.\n\nThe music is decent and gives a proper mood to the whole thing.\n\nOne odd thing to note about the game is that you have to go to a separate website to patch the game. Specifically here[forums.wolfire.com]. Otherwise the game run's very poorly I've heard. I've only played the game patched and it is recommended.\n\nIf you are someone who want's a score then I give the game 5 cassette tapes out 5. Nothing significantly hinders the enjoyment of the game and the core concept is pulled of splendidly.","March 5, 2014","true","26.8"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

The shooting feels nice and feels very rewarding when you hear that *dink* and *crash* that means you succesfully took out an enemy. I learn quickly so the controls were not a problem. But without the little "Help" tap on the left I would have been hopeless. Which is also very well done!\n\nThe one thing I really love is also that you can disable your enemies without destroying them. Like shooting the gun on the automatic turret and stading infront of it to check if it really is disabled is really nerveracking because a shot to the foot and you're dead. I also love the "OH ♥♥♥♥" feeling you get when the gyrocopter spots you and you're out of ammo.\n\nAll in all 8/10 could do with some optimization and a nerf to the flying bots!

You are a "Receiver", one of the very few people who are able to hear a voice inside different mysterious cassettes you find. You must find enough cassettes to "escape" MindKill.\nThis sound a lot like Matrix, and yes, it is something like that.\n\n-The unique gameplay mechanic of the game: It simulate a more realistic way to control a pistol. Specifically a Colt 1911 pistol, a S&W Model 10 "Victory" revolver, and a Glock 17.\nAt first it is VERY complicate to remember every single button to control succesfully a pistol, but with enough practice, you can master it.\n\n-The game offer you a very helpful guide which show you the action of each button. A huge plus in my opinion.\n\n-The whole game take place in one huge level. However all the rooms/places, bullets, cassettes, enemies and the pistol you using is random generated every single time. Something like a Rogue game in other words.\n\n-The feeling controlling successfully a gun by pushing the keys in the rights order, is unbelievable! Me neither believed it at first, but it is true!!!\n\n-The A.I of the enemies is very interesting, specifically the flying drone. One time a flying drone hit a wall while I was running to avoid it. The result was to get disfunctioning and the drone started flying around like a drunk! Hilarious!!!!\nOne another time I shoot a drone and fall down just only to discover when I approached it was still functioning and killed me!!! MotherF*cker!!!!\nThe same goes of course for the gun turrets you fight/avoid in the game.\n\n[Cons]\n\n-The whole game is only one level. That it. Nothing new to add or a New Game Plus mode.\n\n-Only two enemies types: The flying drones and the gun turrets. More enemies would made the game even better.\n\n-Very difficult start. Even if I said it is very enjoyable to master the pistols, you will "suffer" a little to play the game properly.\n\n-My main reason why I gave the game 9/10 stars:\nIf you enter a new room/place, suddenly the game freeze a little for an unknown reason. For this many times I died because gun turrets shot me while I was lagged entering a room....\n\n[Final Thought]\n\nBeing very Cheap on Steam right now, it is a must play just only for the unique experience is offer.\nIt have some problems, but I forgive them very easily.\nI hope for a better and bigger sequel in the future.\n\n9/10","March 20, 2014","true","8.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game focuses gun handling mechanics which instead of pressing R to reaload, you need press multiple keys to take the clip out, putting it in your inventory, getting a loaded clip from your inventory, loading the gun up, and cocking it up. The controls aren't the only challenge though, once you get hit by bullets, or a taser from the killdrones, you die and have to start all over. To add up to the challenge the tapes, ammo, flashlights, and audio cassete tapes are scattered in new locations each time you spawn. The story unravels as you collect more tapes, each with a message revealing the secrets of Mindkill ( or Mindtech ).

The gameplay is not unlike the '-Shock' series, where you're looking for audio tapes whilst trying to avoid and/or get-the-drop-on drones and turrets. The real difference in Reciever is in the shooting/gun mechanics.\n\nThe gun you have in 'shooter' games is usually little more than a fancy finger that goes 'pew pew' wherever you're pointing it. In Reciever, your weapon is a very realistic *system* with which you must learn to interact, both successfully and quickly, in order to survive combat scenarios. This means knowing how many bullets you have in your clip, replacing a clip when you need to, not dropping bullets by accident as you're trying to refill a clip on the fly. All of this is in your direct control. No random dice-rolls... if you get caught with your pants down, it's on you.\n\nIt's that direct relation of personal skill and performance that really draws you in. You will die quickly, and often. But each time you load up the game, or 'respawn', the environment is shuffled randomly. Even the equipment you start with is randomized. No two games are the same. And with almost zero load time. Just get killed by a drone that you didn't know was there until it was too late? It's okay, you immediately find yourself in a totally different place with a new weapon(1 of 3 , that I've seen) to familiarize yourself with and the lessons you learned from your previous life still fresh in your memory... now go see how long you live this time!\n\nThis is a great game and I honestly think every person who's ever played a FPS before should play it. If for no other reason than to gain a little more respect for the weaponry that so many of us have grown to take for granted.\n\nIt's cheap. It's great. I recommend it.","June 9, 2013","true","1.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You are a "Receiver", one of the very few people who are able to hear a voice inside different mysterious cassettes you find. You must find enough cassettes to "escape" MindKill.\nThis sound a lot like Matrix, and yes, it is something like that.\n\n-The unique gameplay mechanic of the game: It simulate a more realistic way to control a pistol. Specifically a Colt 1911 pistol, a S&W Model 10 "Victory" revolver, and a Glock 17.\nAt first it is VERY complicate to remember every single button to control succesfully a pistol, but with enough practice, you can master it.\n\n-The game offer you a very helpful guide which show you the action of each button. A huge plus in my opinion.\n\n-The whole game take place in one huge level. However all the rooms/places, bullets, cassettes, enemies and the pistol you using is random generated every single time. Something like a Rogue game in other words.\n\n-The feeling controlling successfully a gun by pushing the keys in the rights order, is unbelievable! Me neither believed it at first, but it is true!!!\n\n-The A.I of the enemies is very interesting, specifically the flying drone. One time a flying drone hit a wall while I was running to avoid it. The result was to get disfunctioning and the drone started flying around like a drunk! Hilarious!!!!\nOne another time I shoot a drone and fall down just only to discover when I approached it was still functioning and killed me!!! MotherF*cker!!!!\nThe same goes of course for the gun turrets you fight/avoid in the game.\n\n[Cons]\n\n-The whole game is only one level. That it. Nothing new to add or a New Game Plus mode.\n\n-Only two enemies types: The flying drones and the gun turrets. More enemies would made the game even better.\n\n-Very difficult start. Even if I said it is very enjoyable to master the pistols, you will "suffer" a little to play the game properly.\n\n-My main reason why I gave the game 9/10 stars:\nIf you enter a new room/place, suddenly the game freeze a little for an unknown reason. For this many times I died because gun turrets shot me while I was lagged entering a room....\n\n[Final Thought]\n\nBeing very Cheap on Steam right now, it is a must play just only for the unique experience is offer.\nIt have some problems, but I forgive them very easily.\nI hope for a better and bigger sequel in the future.\n\n9/10","March 20, 2014","true","8.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But without the little "Help" tap on the left I would have been hopeless. Which is also very well done!\n\nThe one thing I really love is also that you can disable your enemies without destroying them. Like shooting the gun on the automatic turret and stading infront of it to check if it really is disabled is really nerveracking because a shot to the foot and you're dead. I also love the "OH ♥♥♥♥" feeling you get when the gyrocopter spots you and you're out of ammo.\n\nAll in all 8/10 could do with some optimization and a nerf to the flying bots!

The combat is nothing special; right-click to aim with a small deadzone and left-click to fire. But what makes it a notable experiment in video gaming is the act of reloading. It's nothing so simple as pressing R and waiting for an animation to play out; you have to press a button for almost every action involved.\n\nWhen you first spawn in, you need to check your firearm. There are buttons to pull back (and then lock) the slide, toggle the safety, (de-)♥♥♥♥ the hammer, remove the magazine, place the magazine in a specific inventory slot, remove a magazine from a specific inventory slot, holster the firearm, and load individual rounds into magazines.\n\nIf you can master the art of firing a shot, dropping the mag, holstering the firearm, reloading the magazine, redrawing the firearm, replacing the magazine, and (just for good measure) hitting the bolt release, you'll more than likely get a tingly sensation after doing it. This is hands-on gun porn.\n\nThe rest of the game is pretty basic; textures are a luxury, geometry is flat and neutral, the atmosphere is eerie in a Deus-Ex way, and the lore behind the recordings is rather interesting. Combat is tense and calculated, much more akin to chess than boxing, but sometimes the rules aren't clear enough to ease your frustration every time you die.\n\nIn the end, I'd love to see more games like this for more firearms, if only as an instruction tool for people wanting to learn how to use firearms without access to any or proper instruction.\n\n7/10 - I came 9mm.","February 13, 2014","true","2.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'd spin around and empty 3-4 magazines trying to shoot 1 little drone buzzing around my head.\n\nEventually the game just started trolling and put 3 tapes and 5 turrets in a very small space.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stragglerastic/recommended/234190/","stragglerastic","Lagg&","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stragglerastic/","292 products in account","It's pretty novel and fun but in the end if you've ever shot a real weapon it just makes you want to do that. It's kind of like a dating simulator in that you get a very rough approximation of the real thing but none of the real pleasure of it. Granted, it also comes to you very naturally if you have shot a real weapon. Also I've noticed people in the reviews complaining about the utter randomness in the game including enemies, bullets, gun you get and so forth but there's a very good reason for this and I see what the developer did here.\n\nOne of the first things that you're taught when instructed in shooting is how to check your chamber. It's important to learn because it's one of the main things you do to check if your weapon is safe or not and stops you from accidentally wasting a round. You also need to check a magazine in any gun regardless of whether or not anything is chambered. Basically it's random so you get into the routine of checking your weapon like you would in real life and it's an awesome way of pounding procedure into people's heads.\n\nOn another note you can also do a trick wherein you chamber a round, take the magazine out, then put another one in to get an extra one. In real life it's not very healthy for the magazine's spring and is one of the top 10 ways to literally shoot yourself in the foot but since this is a game go nuts.\n\n\nIn conclusion if you're okay with not having the actual feeling of the shot and getting to feel that pleasurable click of loading rounds and magazine insertion it's probably worth playing if you can get it cheaply. Though I'll personally probably never play it again after I get 11 tapes for the first time.\n\nEdit: Actually cancel that, I wasn't going to mention it but it has some performance issues despite the very simple untextured geometry. It also drives my GPU temperature through the roof because of the apparent load so I'll probably not play much more of it.","October 11, 2014","true","1.2"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

The combat is nothing special; right-click to aim with a small deadzone and left-click to fire. But what makes it a notable experiment in video gaming is the act of reloading. It's nothing so simple as pressing R and waiting for an animation to play out; you have to press a button for almost every action involved.\n\nWhen you first spawn in, you need to check your firearm. There are buttons to pull back (and then lock) the slide, toggle the safety, (de-)♥♥♥♥ the hammer, remove the magazine, place the magazine in a specific inventory slot, remove a magazine from a specific inventory slot, holster the firearm, and load individual rounds into magazines.\n\nIf you can master the art of firing a shot, dropping the mag, holstering the firearm, reloading the magazine, redrawing the firearm, replacing the magazine, and (just for good measure) hitting the bolt release, you'll more than likely get a tingly sensation after doing it. This is hands-on gun porn.\n\nThe rest of the game is pretty basic; textures are a luxury, geometry is flat and neutral, the atmosphere is eerie in a Deus-Ex way, and the lore behind the recordings is rather interesting. Combat is tense and calculated, much more akin to chess than boxing, but sometimes the rules aren't clear enough to ease your frustration every time you die.\n\nIn the end, I'd love to see more games like this for more firearms, if only as an instruction tool for people wanting to learn how to use firearms without access to any or proper instruction.\n\n7/10 - I came 9mm.","February 13, 2014","true","2.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is understandable considering the very short dev. time, but it bears mentioning. For the most part, though, it's a very interesting game. Weapons handling is modeled in a way that no other game (that I'm aware of) has done. Instead of having a reload key, for example, the game has separate buttons to remove/insert magazines, pull the weapon's slide, pull back the hammer, etc. Once you get the hang of it, it makes for a really interesting, tactical experience using the game's weapons.\n\nThe game has a storyline told by finding 11 cassette tapes scattered around an environment that's randomly generated each time you play. Finding all 11 tapes requires a fair bit of exploration, and the random elements of the game give it decent replay-ability, even with only a few weapons and enemy types.\n\nOverall it's an engaging, atmospheric game, but I wouldn’t recommend spending $5 on it. In fact I wouldn’t recommend spending any amount of money on it. The controls are as confusing as ♥♥♥♥, and you die very easily, almost impossible without mods.

This is no simple task, with flying and stationary turrets primed and ready, permanent death in one bullet, and realistic weapons simulation, death awaits every corner.  You must learn how to manipulate every part of a weapon from pulling back the slide, ejecting the mag, and manually refilling cartridges.  What's usually simple, is suddenly a challenge in memory and nerves as you fumble to reload with death at your back.

First off, I got this game for free. So when I saw what it was I figured it should be that way considering it's state and how it'll never be updated. But $5? Are you kidding me? This game is worth $1. I understand it was made for a FPS 7-day competiton thing, but if you're gonna bother to put it on Steam and sell it for 5 DOLLARS, at least put some extra effort and improve it. Maybe have 2 versions, the improved and the original. Also, I can barely run it. There is nothing going on and the game looks like ♥♥♥ yet I am running at 20 FPS with low settings. Optimzation is didn't come to mind when putting this on Steam. Anyway, the concept is good and mechanics work but the difficulty is ridiculously hard. I can only get 1 tape and then you throw like 5 robot things at me at once and I get killed.

It takes the FPS genre to a much higher level of realism. It has no difficulty settings, checkpoints, game save or HUD for that matter.\nYou start the game in a random room inside of a building. You don´t know who you are or why you´re there. Equipped with a 1 of 3 diferent firearms (a Glock 18, a Revolver or a 1911 45. cal Pistol), a flashlight(that you may not get on spawn but be able to find later), and nothing else than that you must find out what is going on.\nWhen walking around the building you will find  turrets or flying robots that will try to kill you. You can fight or run, but in some areas you will just have to go trough them to progress.\nYou will eventually find orange sound tapes that will tell you why you´re there, how to get out, and how to effectively fight the robots and turrets. In order to finish the game you must find all 11 tapes scattered around the building.\n\nThe game mechanics will be hard to understand at 1st, but in time you will get better at it. And if you don´t like some of the controls you can change them from the Launch Menu.\nYou don´t have sights in the screen so you must aim to shoot properly, there are many commands for what you can do with your weapon, and the reload process must be done manually.\nAmmo is in pretty short supply, so you got to look around in the building and find bullets, equip it in your magazine (or barrel) and put in your inventory(in case you are using a pistol), then have it ready to reload in combat.\n\nAlso this game is made with the Unity engine, so don´t expect anything fancy here.","September 28, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The first thing you notice are that the graphics are mediocre at best, but in a game like this it really doesn't hurt the immersion factor one bit. The immersion is amazing, by the way. This game is an unintentional survival horror game. Enemies can and WILL scare the ♥♥♥♥ outta you.\n\nBut then after a little while I got a hang of the controls, and that's where things really picked up. After you start to get proficient at controlling the gun and even the more advanced mechanics of switching out whole mags quickly instead of just reloading a few bullets, the game gets immensely more involved. You're no longer concerned with just getting one or two tapes, you want them all. You want them bad, you've already spent several hours on this thing... So you start to learn the very well-implemented mechanics of localized damaging, where you need to hit a specific part of an enemy to take it out, and with as few bullets as possible. No CoD-style shooting at someones hands or legs to damage them.\n\nThe voice acting is not great, he fumbles around with words a bit and sometimes the sound clips a bit, but it doesn't matter because given the story it's totally reasonable for this. Story-wise: They might not have had enough time to record a super-fancy nice message. Development wise, they only had a week. Cut em' some slack.\n\nEventually, you get to the point where you've heard every tape a dozen times and seen every enemy almost every time, and you still may not have beaten the game because there are so many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tapes. At this point, there's a very real possibility that you could get tired of the game due to the lack of variety and extreme difficulty. But, if you persevere, and there's a good chance that you'll beat it, and oh boy... When you beat it, it's so satisfying. INCREDIBLY satisfying.\n\nOn top of all that there's actually a good bit of replay value thanks to the randomization of all the maps (Though it admittedly can ♥♥♥♥ you up someimtes and it's entirely possible to have an impossible-to-beat map) and even the modding community that has managed to add in a bunch of different stuff to make the game play better.\n\nSo to recap!\n\nPros:\n+ Great gun mechanics\n+ Accurate gun and bullet physics\n+ Randomization of structures item locations\n+ Reasonable learning curve\n+ Amazing immersion\n+ Very satisfying to finally beat\n+ Good replay value\n+ Great modding community\n\nCons:\n- Very poor textures even on highest settings\n- Poor optimization due to engine limitations\n- Only 2 gun types by default\n- Only 2 types of enemies\n- Borderline extreme difficulty to get all 11 tapes (At least for me),\nmeaning it can take a long time to beat with a lot of potential frustration.\n- Randomization can ♥♥♥♥ you over\n\nOverall I would definitely recommend this game. It's an impressive and fun to play twist on the FPS genre made in only a week.","May 14, 2015","true","8.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Basically it breaks down all the physical actions required to operate a gun, then binds (nearly) every individual action to a key, then puts it on top of a standard FPS control setup.\n\nSo it's fun to manage bullets, but it's more difficult than it really should be due to luck. Which leads me to my only real gripe with the game.\n\nEvery time you start a new game the world is randomly generated from a set of premade areas that connect in a linear fashion. Since item placement, starting equipment, and enemy placement is randomized as well, you can end up with a bad start and find no ammo but run into tons of enemies.\n\nLastly, when moving from one prefab-area to another, the game seems to hitch for a second while it loads stuff, this has killed me so many times I think it's probably the biggest flaw. Not being able to react to a flying killbot coming at you for even half a second can easily be the difference between life and death.","September 23, 2015","true","6.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The gun system is by the most interesting part of this game, and the main selling point of it: There is no "Press R to reload" in this game, ammo doesn't magicly appear in your clip.. Heck, you might not even have an extra mag, meaning reloading requires you to go through the effort of putting in each bullet into the mag, provided you even have some bullets stored away.\n\nReally, I wish more games had such a deep gun system, where you have to manually reload the realistic way instead of just pressing R and making a new magazine poof into the gun. however, it is a shame that such a system is wasted here...\n\nWhile it is fun to fiddle with a gun in this game, what holds it back is how the game is played.. The goal of the game is to collect a certain number of tapes while fighting off robotic sentries in a randomly generated series of buildings. However, what this quickly boils into is a game that is nothing but pure luck if you win or not. The world is so randomly generated that it is possible that it could spawn an impossible situation that makes the game unwinnable.. Other times, however, it might just give you all the tapes right near the start, although this is rare.. From what I heard, it isn't worth it, though.\n\nSo what about the combat? Surely it must be fun. And it is, provided you only are fighting ground-based sentries. But the moment you come across a flyer, kiss your progress goodbye because the blimy little robotic dinks will kill you so fast it baffles the mind. You will tremble in fear the moment you hear their buzzing down the hallway, maybe even try and find another way around, because no matter how hard you try, you can't beat them.. Not without either getting insanely lucky or throwing half your ammo at it.\n\nThis is because of how crazed their movement is, the flyers flying in such a wobbly way that it makes it hard to hit them, let alone once they start charging you.. They shake so hard that it is like staring at a very angry blur. This makes it very hard to hit weakpoints, and the fact that they are melee based makes it worse, since you have no way of protecting yourself against the speedy hunks of junk unless you run like a bat out of hell and get lucky enough to avoid them. Wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the one-hit death system.\n\nCombine random generation with such unfair enemies and you get a game that oftentime, no matter how hard you may try, you will never be able to beat. Not because it is hard, but because the game tends to play unfair, sometimes going the extra mile to make sure you suffer your fair share of cheap deaths. A shame, really.. Were it not for the bullish systems in place, this game woulda been great.. But alas it is held back by some real unfun flaws.","October 31, 2014","false","6.9"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","14","29","0","0"

I like the idea of a game where you actually have to go through all the motions of maintaining your weapon, e.g. opening the chamber, extracting the empty casings, loading the new bullets, closing the chamber, pulling the hammer, etc. There is something tactile about it that is very satisfying.\n\nThe thing that really kills it for me, though, is that the different styles of gun lead to completely different control schemes. Sometimes equipping the flashlight is the 2 key, but sometimes it is the 1 key. In one round, tapping Z causes you to load more bullets into the empty chambers you're examining, but in the next round, pressing Z will make you drop the clip you're examining onto the ground (even if it's full). There are too many buttons doing too many things as it is, but then when the game shifts them around on you every round, it only compounds the problem. Those who are patient enough to go through the pain of memorizing all this may not have a bad time, but it is a major hurdle to the enjoyment of the game.\n\nThe point at which I quit the game though was when I loaded a new round and the randomization placed me inside a room with a flying turret directly behind me. Literally, the round started, I heard a gunshot, and the round was over. I know roguelikes are super into busting the player's balls with randomization, but that seemed a bit steep.\n\nIn short, I love the idea, but I don't think I like the execution.","December 13, 2015","false","0.4"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","14","29","0","0"

I can't remember how I ended up getting it on Steam--I had it before I had a Steam account and I didn't like it then either. But I decided after reinstalling it that I would try playing it to see if I could get good at it.\n\nIt was made in like 24 hours so it's perfectly excusable that I can't recommend it. But things like rendering shouldn't be a problem for most players of a game. I don't have much trouble with other, more complex games with textures and stuff that my computer actually has to load as it goes. Unless I reduce the resolution to like 560x480 or something ludicrously tiny like that, this game is completely unplayable because of the lag (a common complaint, it seems).\n\nAside from that, this game is not intuitive in the slightest. It looks like I'm definitely not the only person who has had incredible amounts of trouble just figuring out how to load my handgun. Again, this is excusable because it was made in so little time. If you're a diehard fan of guns and roguelikes, have uncanny powers of patience and fantastic eyesight, maybe watch a trailer or something and see if you think you would like it. Personally, I would not pay anything for a sequel unless it was a fully-developed and crafted game.","September 12, 2014","false","0.5"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","13","27","0","0"

The storyline is short and not compelling, the game doesn't run or look particularly well at all, and the gunplay is unique, but not enough to hold my interest.\n\nThe story is told through audiotapes found randomly throughout the game. I found it rather uninteresting, which in part is to be expected as the primary objective of the developer was to experiment with gunplay mechanics. As a result we have a storyline that just gives you a reason to collect audiotapes and shoot guns at robots.\n\nThe game did not run particularly well for me, and I doubt it’s a problem with my hardware. Clipping and pop-ins are fairly common. The environment is not textured so anything other than the guns you use look bland. The backdrop of a metropolis was a nice touch but overall the game was unimpressive graphically and technically.\n\nThe gameplay is centered on the gunplay. You are given a random gun in a random condition with a random amount of ammo. You can manipulate nearly any aspect of the gun including pulling the hammer back or loading bullets individually into a magazine, and each action requires a different key. It takes time to learn, but once you start to figure it out it becomes increasingly satisfying to quickly empty the casings out of a revolver and reload it. You fight two types of enemies, a flying taser robot and a turret. Different parts of the enemies react in different ways when shot, so accuracy is rewarded over speed. For example the strategy I usually attempted to employ was to shoot the camera on the turrets as ideally it would take one bullet, and they would no longer be able to detect me. Admittedly the gunplay is interesting, but in the end I don't think it’s capable of holding up the whole package.\n\nWithout a worthwhile story and weak graphics, the gameplay fails to make this game worth the $5.00 price tag. I'm glad someone experimented with gunplay to make this game, and if you can pick it up for a cheaper price or free, it is worth trying. Gun enthusiasts should also reconsider what I have said, because this game might be something you will find quite enjoyable.\n\n","January 19, 2015","false","1.6"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","10","21","0","2"

Everything about the game is in need of polish, from an awful UI (for such an extremely sparse UI as it is), to intentionally poor control layout, to the combination of these factors exacerbating its brutal difficulty. It's impressive how such a simple game can fail on so many levels.\n\nThe game is brutal in it's difficulty. Not because the enemies can kill you with a single hit, or that they greatly outnumber you, or that you have very limited ammo, or that it's intentionally difficult to aim your weapon properly, or that some enemies appear to be able to absorb prodigious amounts of ammo for little to no good reason. No, the biggest difficulty creator is the fact that there is no rhyme or reason to the control layout beyond the normal movement and aiming and firing controls. Yes, the game is supposed to have a difficult mechanic of maintaining your weapon. But the button placements make no sense - they neither emulate the firearm that you are using, nor are they set up in a way that encourages a logical pattern. They're just generally clustered around the WASD keys like the developer just slapped them down whenever he thought of a new feature that guns have that he had yet to implement.\n\nThe only hook into the plot (what little plot there appears be) is from audio tapes that have a poor voice over that you may or may not find near the beginning of your adventure. There is nothing that will make you feel like you have a need to complete the plot, other than any intrinsic desire you may still harbor for completing the game for the sake of completion alone.\n\nAlso, a very special frustration that I managed to encounter is the fact that the game offers no way to reset one's controls to the defaults, but the UI that gives you control hints entirely works on having the default controls. So if you change your controls you'll either need to give up on using the tutorial UI, or find them online (at the time I write this I was incapable of finding them listed), or delete your registry keys from Windows so the game is forced into returning your defaults to you.\n\nThe only people who should buy this game are the heedlessly masochistic and the curious game developers who want to explore the concept and how not to approach it. Even then, wait until it's on sale.","October 9, 2013","false","0.9"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

You engage at your own pace* taking short bursts of high risk. "High risk" can be as mundane as turning a corner. If you don't see the telltale spotlights, robots shoot you and you die instantly. Situational awareness is sacrosanct and there are no non-diegetic distractions. It manages to be tense, and then routine, which causes laziness and then death. The high lethality, immobile enemies, and detailed gun manipulation emphasize readiness. To get ready, there's lots to do. There's nothing like being ready to go with a robot around the corner, magazines topped off, safety off, ironsights up, and dying because you forgot to chamber a round. The game does suspense very well.\n\nYou start completely over when you die. You collect random pickups for your random gun around randomly placed enemies in random structures**. There are "plot" tapes to collect but you won't realistically collect them all ever. Some are blank. It's neat how nakedly cultlike they are. Like a real-life cult, not videogame-standard delusional idiots. Mystical ideas have materialist labels. The speaker in the tapes is a gun-and-apocalypse obsessed cult leader. He says they're magical superpower-granting tapes. You have to listen to all of them a ridiculous number of times (it's meta, you will hear the same ones over and over.) Your gun holster and pouch and loose ammo is standard kit. It's almost what the Branch Davidians would sound like if they did their propaganda mail-order.\n\nUltimately though, it's not very good. It's kind of ugly. It's badly optimized, and lags when generating a new area. There's hardly any content. The lighting is obviously wrong in places. Some of the procedural areas don't "line up" and connect right. One map area has stairs with an invisible ledge you have to jump over. If you jump on a bed your head clips through the ceiling. The environment can clip through your inventory. It's possible to get physically stuck where it's impossible to get out or die. There are a ton of tapes and sometimes the random number generator is just unfair. The game has a lot of problems. It's an extremely unrefined version of a neat idea***, so I wouldn't recommend it to most people. It's only five bucks and I'm not most people, so it worked out for me.\n\n*I died at spawn once because a robot spawned in an adjacent area in line of sight.\n**Technically procedurally random but who cares.\n***Because it literally is, it took a week to make.","August 24, 2014","false","15.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

While not inherently "bad"... Receiver isn't a game that will be enjoyed or appreciated by most people; that is why I'm giving it the down vote, to be honest I don't recommend or recommend-against playing this game, I simply didn't find it enjoyable.\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  You there! collect all the tapes! "who me? Why do I want to do that?" That's what I want to ask, but I'm not given that luxury. I collected only a couple tapes before getting tired of being murdered by the turrets 10+ times. Presumably you are collecting these tapes to uncover a mystery within the game and to understand what's going on inside the game.\n\nGame Play: First thing you do: Press ? on your keyboard so you can see what to do\nSecond thing you do: go through an acurete and realistic weapon arming proccess\nthird thing you do: run around and collect stuff on the floor\nfourth thing you do: run into your first enemy and get yourself killed\nGoal: To collect 11 tapes\n\nThe highlight for this game are the gun handling mechanics, you don't simply press "R" to reload, depending on the weapon you're using you need to press a button to change the cartage and then press a button to load a new one.\nFor the revolver, you actually need to open the revolver, take out the old bullets, and put in new ones. While very interesting, and highly realistic, the game is not very easy to learn and will require learning new tricks if you want to actually survive the game play.\nI took down several of the auto turrets, there seem to be two kinds: Flying, and stationary. Both of them are really annoying if they spot you. If you get seen, you have a second to dodge around the corner. My instincts to shoot back usually ended up getting me killed.\n\nAchievements: No achievements (thankfully), unless you want to make them for yourself, I think collecting 11 tapes would be quite the accomplishment.\n\nPrice:  This game just ended up in my steam game library, so free is free, but the price is $4.99 on the steam page. Probably not worth it for most people.\n\nConclusion: I realize this game was made for the "7-day FPS challenge" which is why the graphics and the environment is very basic. But I just didn't really enjoy the game play, if there was more story, or just something to keep me interested I'd probably enjoy it more.\nThis game would appeal to people who want to see what a game would be like with more realistic gun mechanics, however after playing it, I see why these types of mechanics aren't implemented in traditional shooters; because it breaks up the action within the game.","January 8, 2015","false","0.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

It is actually more beneficial to avoid most of the enemies than to actually shoot at them with your gun.

I really wanted to like this game, I really did, but there is a major problem with it. This game is sooooooo poorly optimized it is nearly unplayable. According to the store page, my PC not only met the Minimum requirements, but the Recommended requrements (barely but still) yet the game had UNBEARABLE framerate and mouse lag. I  mean it takes almost 2 seconds for the gun to move after you move the mouse. Sure, what's 2 seconds? Well in a game where you have enemies that are flying quickly, turrets that can kill you almost immediately after spotting you and limited ammo to hit small targets on previously stated enemies... yeah the mouse lag can really be a problem. It wouldn't bother me if the requirements of my PC aren't powerful enough, but I have read the requirements and they match (so don't blame my crappy Computer that [supposedly] meets the requirements).\n\nNow onto the actual game... there isn't much. The game is very simple. Collect all the Cassette Tapes around the level, while killing off all enemies and trying to survive. The main feature is the realistic gun unloading/reloading mechanics. Everytime you need to reload or whatever, you need to manually pull back slide, take out magazine, store in inventory, take new magazine out of inventory, load new magazine, unlock slide, and pull back hammer before being able to fire your gun. Each step has its own corresponding key to hit and it overall is annoying. It loses its novelty very quickly and just makes reloading a chore. It also makes it impossible in a firefight. Also each of the three different weapons has different reloading sequences... great.\n\nAlso levels are randomly generated after death. So once you die, cassete location, enemy location and type, bullet count, flashlight batterey life, and gun type all change. This gives the challenge and overall is annoying since enemies (who instakill I should add) can be right around any corner. Also bullets are in random spots so good luck finding them when you have ran out and are now running from your life against flying guys in a hallway that has a turret around the corner at the end of it. What should happen is instead of the levels randomize after death, have a randomize button so you can know the layout and actually finish a level.\n\nOverall, the game has a cool idea but the poor optimization and annoying instakill enemies with tiny weakpoints ruin a game that could have had some really tense atmosphere.","March 13, 2014","false","0.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The story in the tapes you collect ingame is mildly interesting, but not great. There's very little music, and it's nothing special. The level is really basic, boring, and overly minimalistic. Visuals are generally kinda ugly, without much style too. There's only two types of enemies, and while the idea of hitting them in specific locations is a cool idea, it's really tough in practice. The turrets aren't too hard to hit (there's a bit of a challenge, but not too much) or in some cases just to avoid, but the flying drones are nearly impossible to hit in the critical spots, and can require more than one hit, despite them flying extremely erratically. Combat can be frustrating, and not in a way that made me feel skilled for dispatching an enemy, so much as glad I wasn't hit myself. After almost two hours of trying to enjoy this game, I realized my hope was futile. The idea and core gunplay of a game is there, but nothing else of substance. Oh! I almost forgot the worst offence! It's buggy and laggy to high hell!

You explore randomly genned buildings to find 10 recordings. It has some really interesting and detailed gun mechanics and provides a huge challenge. The enemies consist of turrets and these flying patrol bots. The turrets are easy to take out but you have to be careful not to rush into a room, they'll kill you right away if you're spotted. The patrol bots are the big issue, they're difficult to hit in mid air and they move very very fast. A big part of the game is luck and exploring, you'll need to get a lucky world gen and if you're not so lucky you'll have to go looking for bullets and hopefully find a revolver. It's pretty simple and might bore some people. But I suggest checking out some gameplay videos.

But the basic gameplay elements, controls, are rarely if never before seen. I have not encountered a game that makes you actually manipulate a firearm in the ways this game makes you. You are forced to load a magazine manually, load the mag into the gun, turn the safety off, rack the slide, then you can commence the shooting. Which is unweildy and hard to remember during high stress situations just like with real guns.\n\nIts a shame the gameplay is crap and it runs so poorly on my machine. Framerate bogs down for no reason for me and the enemys that fly are often going to kill you out of nowhere. Its all randomly generated, but more often than not those flying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s will be in a ridiculous spot that its either easy to shoot them or you are dead before you could even know you were being attacked.\n\nThat said these elements need to be taken and put into a survival horror game. Chance the controls for firearm manipulation to the mouse maybe or not, this game needs to be made.\n\nBut unless you really like to see diffrent games and this "game" is on sale than don't buy it. Its not worth the price they have asked for it because its very very basic to the point of being a demo of gameplay for a much larger game. A larger game that dousn't exist.","April 17, 2014","true","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's about the gun handling. Once you have gotten the hang of it and played a while, you'll want mechanics like these in other games, too.\n\nTip, which might not work for everybody, but it worked well for me: Change the keyboard configuration. The game's built-in help will still show the old keys :( but the names of the functions listed in the external window where you reassign the keys, those will tell you just what you need to know, and when you have reassigned those functions, you'll kinda know what to do when. It's actually pretty easy. The in-game help can be a little confusing, so ignore it.

But it's not that easy. There are enemies scattered around the world and it is your choice to either bypass them or shoot your way through. Remember, your health is a 1 shot kill. So you only get 1 chance.\nThe main core of the gameplay in this game is the guns. Unlike normal shooters, youl have to input various keys to perform actions in your guns. Reloading can take 4 keys to press. The ballistics include bullet drop and ricochet.\nWhile the gun mechanics are pretty realistic, the enemies have a pretty estratigic way to deal with them apart from just shooting them.\nWhile there are only 2 types of enemies, they are enough to make you pull your hair out. Enemies are pretty much sentries and drones. And they must function somehow. The strategy to eliminate enemies is to shoot vital parts. For example, you can shoot the sensor and they won't spot you anymore. Il leave the rest for you to find out the other vital parts. If you so desire to get the game of course.\n\nBut lets review the features of this game.\nFeatures\n\nDetailed simulations of a Colt 1911 pistol, S&W Model 10 "Victory" revolver, and Glock 17 with full-auto mod\nWhile partially true, the guns do have detailed models and ways to operate them. But they mostly include only the important bits of the gun for the gameplay.\n\nTaser robots and machine gun turrets with physically-based damage models\nAs said above before the features. This is true.\n\nBallistic modeling of ricochets and bullet drop\nAgain, as said above, this is true. Nothing else to had.\n\n11 audio tapes to prepare you to defend yourself against the inevitable Mindkill event\nThe tapes are the objective of the game, these tapes explain the world you live in, the guns and how to use them, the machines and how they work etc. They also include parts of the story. I find this a very interesting way to have a tutorial. But it's not a very good way to deliver one. The audio tapes are random, so the chances of you getting a tape explaining how the enemies work, can take sometime.\n\nBecome literate in how guns actually operate\nI can confirm this since I shot the floor, the bullet ricochet and still killed me. Don't shoot the floor kids.\n\nWhile the game can be fun and frustrating at times, it delivers quite an experience no other game can achieve.\nI belive it took me 9 hours to finally complete the game once.\n\nNow for the moment of truth. Buy or not to buy?\nFor 5 bucks, i'd say go for it. While the game is simple with complex mechanics, as a rogue-like I belive it offers alot of replayability.","March 31, 2015","true","16.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is great. The idea is fantastic and the sense of survival it goes for is achieved. Does it look like it could have been made in Google SketchUp? YES (at least on my computer it does). But it goes surprisingly deep for what it is. You spawn in a random part of what appears to be a huge house, or apartment bulidings, or neither I'm really not sure. You are then given one of three handguns, a Glock, a revolver, and a Colt 1911. This is where the game get's really interesting. The controls focus around the gun. There is a key set to open the reciever, a key set to take out the magazine, a key set to pull the hammer back. Everything you would actually do with a gun, and magazine for that matter, there's a key for it in this game. To me that is fantastic. It's new to me, and I tend to doubt there have been many if any games that follow that same idea. The second interesting point of this game are the audiotapes you pick up. They give a wonderful backstory to the game, telling you why you are there, and hinting at something sinister. In that way, it's like the Matrix, only voiced by Microsoft Sam. If you see this game for 50%, heck 33% off or more buy it. You will not regret it. This game get's my 7/10. The idea is great, but I wish the game was more replayable.","March 23, 2014","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's inherently satisfying to manually reload your weapon as quickly as you can, once you have a grasp on the mechanics. It's tense and fun when you hear a drone around a corner, look out for its camera light, and time it just right to shoot and disable it unscathed. There's some nice use of adaptive music, a scarcity of ammunition forcing you to make every shot count, and some terrifying flying drones to escape from.\n\nHowever, being made in a short amount of time, in Unity, and using randomly generated environments, I've run into framerate issues, repetitive environments, graphical whoopsies, and situations with no chance of success. As well, the objective of collecting tapes involves listening to a monotone voice drone exposition that is often heard over and over again after respawning. You can fully mute the voice volume in the settings, at least.\n\nIt's worth the $5 pricetag, but I was happy to pick it up on sale if you catch my drift.","June 30, 2014","true","18.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is pretty nice in a lot of concepts. For example, how you control your gun. There are 3 basic weapons; The M1911 Colt, the Glock 18, and a .357 Revolver (I think it is a .357) and all three have their own way of control. The Colt and Glock have the same controls except that hitting V forthe Colt will put on the Safety while the Glock makes it either go Semi or Automatic. I like the Revolver and how you can spin the chamber as much as you want with the mouse wheel. Or you can spin it before you place it back. There is a lot of stuff about the game that makes it a good game. On the other hand, I do go through a little bit of some issues here and there. For example, I get random FPS drops when going through different areas on the map, but it goes away half a second later. And I am currently having Lighting FX issues (Probably my side). Besides that, this game is definitely worth it.

It's much more satisfying to successfully blast a turret or drone when you know that those bullets you are using really matter because you might not have enough for later if you use too many on just one turret.

You have to fill ammo clip before loading it to your gun, prepare it to fire, remove ammo clip, and fill it again. A bit challenging at the beggining, but enojyable after understanding. You encounter 3 types of guns:\n-Revolver- 6 rounds in barrel, you have to remove shells after firing\n-Colt 1911 A1- regular gun, normal mag, can be turned into safe mode (unable to fire)\n-Glock - Basicly the same as Colt, but safe mode has been replaced with full auto mod\nYou start game with one of them, random amount of ammo, and sometimes with a flashlight.

It's a basic, relatively simple game that doesn't look amazing, but what's actually there is great. Each level is procedurally generated so the map is never the same, you always have randomized ammo/equipment, and one bullet from a turret or shock from a flying drone will kill you. It makes piecing together the 2spooky story that's told across 11 tapes randomly placed on the map very difficult, but wonderfully tense.\n\nAnd of course, there's the game's real star - three guns that operate the same way actual firearms do. There's no crosshair, no ammo counter, and your mags don't magically refill themselves - assuming you have more than one, anyway. Doing a brass check and topping off magazines with loose rounds are actually things you'll find yourself doing in this game, as are other gun-specific actions like releasing the slide, dropping empty brass from a revolver, and spinning a cylinder to a loaded chamber, all of which require multiple button presses to accomplish. Sometimes, you'll even find it necessary to holster your weapon to complete an action such as filling a magazine, or pull the weapon down from the "aimed" position into a low ready to sprint away from danger. It's not the prettiest or most action-packed game out there, but Receiver is the closest a game has ever come to recreating the sensation of using an actual firearm. Very, very much worth the $5 purchase price.","July 20, 2013","true","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's about the gun handling. Once you have gotten the hang of it and played a while, you'll want mechanics like these in other games, too.\n\nTip, which might not work for everybody, but it worked well for me: Change the keyboard configuration. The game's built-in help will still show the old keys :( but the names of the functions listed in the external window where you reassign the keys, those will tell you just what you need to know, and when you have reassigned those functions, you'll kinda know what to do when. It's actually pretty easy. The in-game help can be a little confusing, so ignore it. Just reassign the keys and study the existing functions in the process.","October 1, 2013","true","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is great. The idea is fantastic and the sense of survival it goes for is achieved. Does it look like it could have been made in Google SketchUp? YES (at least on my computer it does). But it goes surprisingly deep for what it is. You spawn in a random part of what appears to be a huge house, or apartment bulidings, or neither I'm really not sure. You are then given one of three handguns, a Glock, a revolver, and a Colt 1911. This is where the game get's really interesting. The controls focus around the gun. There is a key set to open the reciever, a key set to take out the magazine, a key set to pull the hammer back. Everything you would actually do with a gun, and magazine for that matter, there's a key for it in this game. To me that is fantastic. It's new to me, and I tend to doubt there have been many if any games that follow that same idea. The second interesting point of this game are the audiotapes you pick up. They give a wonderful backstory to the game, telling you why you are there, and hinting at something sinister. In that way, it's like the Matrix, only voiced by Microsoft Sam. If you see this game for 50%, heck 33% off or more buy it. You will not regret it. This game get's my 7/10. The idea is great, but I wish the game was more replayable.","March 23, 2014","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This means aiming is a pain in the ♥♥♥ and very unrealistic to actual gun aiming. I also had to massively reduce my mouse speed in order to actually aim, though it was still hard to aim as the gun jumps around for every pixel you would have moved with your mouse.","May 10, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But the basic gameplay elements, controls, are rarely if never before seen. I have not encountered a game that makes you actually manipulate a firearm in the ways this game makes you. You are forced to load a magazine manually, load the mag into the gun, turn the safety off, rack the slide, then you can commence the shooting. Which is unweildy and hard to remember during high stress situations just like with real guns.\n\nIts a shame the gameplay is crap and it runs so poorly on my machine. Framerate bogs down for no reason for me and the enemys that fly are often going to kill you out of nowhere. Its all randomly generated, but more often than not those flying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s will be in a ridiculous spot that its either easy to shoot them or you are dead before you could even know you were being attacked.\n\nThat said these elements need to be taken and put into a survival horror game. Chance the controls for firearm manipulation to the mouse maybe or not, this game needs to be made.\n\nBut unless you really like to see diffrent games and this "game" is on sale than don't buy it. Its not worth the price they have asked for it because its very very basic to the point of being a demo of gameplay for a much larger game.

It's a quite unique game in my opinion.\n\nFirst thing: the way you handle the gun is very realistic, so the button layout is very different than normal games, especially when you reload. You have to press each button for certain actions; for example, with a revolver, you must 1) open the chamber 2) drop all the empty cartridges (some may get stuck sometimes, so you gotta shake em/hit the key repeatedly) 3) reload each bullets 4) close the chamber. <<so there are 4 different buttons to press to reload as for other games, reload is just 'r'. There are three different types of guns: Glock, Colt 1191, and S&W revolver. They all have different ways to reload, but the same action = same keys. You will feel SOOOOOOOOO achieved if you get used to reloading well that you can reload smoothly and fast without even thinking.\n\nThere are only two types of enemies in this game: automatic sentry gun & flying taser robot, which is kinda scary when you actually face them because they **cking fly at you like a tsunami. They have limited sight (so sneak when you're out of their sight and ambush? I guess. That's not a very good word for this kind of situation but I suck at English so... Yeah..) but they if they detect you, good night man (unless you have an Asian reflexes on mice or consol that you can hit certain part of robot when it's flying the **ck at you). And damaging certain parts will either break (different parts) or kill the machine.\n\nAnyways, the goal of this game is to find 11 recorded tapes and I think it's game over then. HOWEVER! I bet not a person among 1000 players can finish this game as fast as they thought it would end. As you can see, I played 10.4 hours of this game and still wasn't able to finish the game and I consider myself not THAT bad of a FPS shooter... I'M ASIAN FOR GOD'S SAKE!\n\nUhh.... I wanna explain more but I gotta go to sleep so.... maybe if someone asks to write more about this game I'll write it in Korean and English both detailed. Oh and also, are there any games out there like this? Because I'd love to see this kind of game actually developed well. I mean... This game was made in less than a week so great respect for that. Gnight it's late is Asia.\n\n-Devil-","January 2, 2014","true","11.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Random weapon loadout, random level design, search for the mcguffin objectives (with embarassing voice work), and frustrating enemies that have locational damage models that mean that it's pretty much random if your shots do any good.\n\nBasically, the game is designed as youtube scarecam fodder, with all that entails.

Now one could make the argument that "it is better than cod" while it might be better in the long run, it is just a sloppy game that had a very short time window. If it had more time then i could see this game being more playable but i seem to be going on nothing so i'll start the real review now.\nFirst off, guns are few to none and tiny little robots that want to turn your chest cavity into swiss cheese are every where, you may spawn with a gun or a flashlight or simply nothing. Finding a gun isn't very easy because you die pretty fast because you have as much bullet resistance as President Lincoln and when you finally get a gun, the magazine is shorter than a Japanese midget.\nObjectives are not marked, there is no way to find your way around and there are no checkpoints. If you find these complaints stupid and like COD, then you have COD on your mind, because listing all the FPS's with those 3 things would take longer than i care for. This game does need navigations though, because every time you die the world gets randomized leaving you lost. Marked objectives are a must have because the only objective is to collect these little VHS tapes or what the hell ever, and they are small as a Chinese elf and some times blend into the enviroment.\nOverall this game is just not worth playing, not only is it filled to the brim with bugs it is only fun for 20 minuets AND you die from 5 feet falls, i sh!t you not. Maybe if they made a Receiver 2 and put more behind it than "OH LOOK WE HAVE RANDOM GENERATED WORLD N' ROBOTS N' GUNS" then i would consider playing it. 3/10","July 16, 2014","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game itself is simple to game, you are a simple gamer and the game is to find 11 game tapes for the game. You game with a gun and you find ammo, and if you game hard enough you might collect all 11 tapes. I have not gamed hard enough for such a game as this, and I have disgraced my gamer family. But I haven't heard of anybody gaming hard enough to give this game the business (game business, of course), so perhaps I will be allowed back into my game family.

It's a basic, relatively simple game that doesn't look amazing, but what's actually there is great. Each level is procedurally generated so the map is never the same, you always have randomized ammo/equipment, and one bullet from a turret or shock from a flying drone will kill you. It makes piecing together the 2spooky story that's told across 11 tapes randomly placed on the map very difficult, but wonderfully tense.\n\nAnd of course, there's the game's real star - three guns that operate the same way actual firearms do. There's no crosshair, no ammo counter, and your mags don't magically refill themselves - assuming you have more than one, anyway. Doing a brass check and topping off magazines with loose rounds are actually things you'll find yourself doing in this game, as are other gun-specific actions like releasing the slide, dropping empty brass from a revolver, and spinning a cylinder to a loaded chamber, all of which require multiple button presses to accomplish. Sometimes, you'll even find it necessary to holster your weapon to complete an action such as filling a magazine, or pull the weapon down from the "aimed" position into a low ready to sprint away from danger. It's not the prettiest or most action-packed game out there, but Receiver is the closest a game has ever come to recreating the sensation of using an actual firearm.

This game's main mechanic is having a pistol that you literally need to press a different key to do each action with. Unlike conventional FPSs, reloading is not simply pressing the "R" key, there's a full sequence. I will give the creator of the game the benefit of the doubt and say they were trying to go for interesting mechanics, but all they really succeeded in was creating a frustrating game that's pretty much just annoying to play.\n\nThe game is essentially rogue-like, so even if you end up progressing in the strange plot at all, one small misstep, and you (which I assume is made of paper mache) die and need to restart immediately.\n\nInteresting concept, terrible execution. Honestly, I'm not sure if there is a way to execute said concept WELL, but as it stands, I cannot really say much in favor of this game. Maybe if the devs actually spend more than a week on this game and actually polished it, I could recommend it (Not even making this up, the game was made in a week). But it's buggy. It's basic.

I'm sure there are those who will enjoy this game, but for me I couldn't really get started to even begin enjoying it.\n\nLots of gun controls that forced me to have to have the help open on the right constantly. Then times when I wasn't sure if the gun was loaded or not. As soon as an enemy shoots you, you die as you have just the tiniest amount of health.\n\nSo, spending time wandering around some weird building and dying, whilst not knowing how to use the complicated guns (and often having next to no ammo to begin with), just frustrated me and made me want to go play something else instead. But your mileage may vary, of course. It's just not for me.","September 15, 2014","false","0.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Said nobody ever. Reciever takes weapon handeling to a whole new level. The game has a fine art on making you learn how to use a gun from scratch. No PRESS X TO RELOAD title that gets shoved up your eyes, just learn by trial and error which is a nice change of pace. The idea seems cool and I wish they did that in more games. I only wish there was a bit more content in the game but it was made in only seven days so in my books thats an impressive feat. Give me a level editor in a game and in seven days and I can show you why you wasted your time on me. My level would be a mess of red barrels and AI that just stand in their place doing nothing.\n\nOverall Reciever gets a 6.5/10 A decent idea and fun to dabble around in for a small while.

Yes.  Fun? No.  Great idea.  Ultimately poor execution.\nIf it were free, I'd have recommended it. On sale for $1-2, meh-aybe.  Probably not worth $5.\n\nI realize this isn't some triple-A, and I wasn't expecting one.  I don't really regret my $2 spent (on sale).  But if I were to go back I'd probably've skipped this one.  I didn't find the game fun, and often found it frustrating.\n\nThe Good: I really enjoyed the fresh take on the FPS, and appreciate the realism.  I hope some of it is incorporated into full-fledged games.  Though only a few pistols, they contain more character than most game's entire arsenals.\n\nThe Bad: Gotta hack the Linux version a little if you don't wanna play on a 5" screen.  I have a high-end rig, yet performance was somehow a problem.  Its particularly frustrating when you're playing at a crawl-pace to avoid dying (you die so easily and frequently that you're forced to), only for the game to stall for a second when you finally encounter a robot and that's that, game over.  I was frequently placed in dark portions of the level w/o a flashlight to start w/ (even when you find a flashlight, it only illuminates ~10 feet or so).  Even after maxing brightness on my monitor I was annoyed w/ how hard it was to see in the darkness.\n\nOh yeah, and don't expect anything from the 'story', as it consists of tapes w/ an annoyingly borish voice droning on about something I didn't care about (something about how 'dangerously addictive media' had destroyed the world).\n\nIn conclusion, it really is mildly interesting, and I appreciate what the devs did.  Its just more of an experiment/demonstration than a game.","March 10, 2014","false","2.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This is not as easy as it sounds (it's really damn hard actually). Every time you play, the labyrinth-like building you explore is randomly generated as you play, making no two runs the same.\n\nThe most obvious main feature is weapon handling. In this game, you have a gun. I mean REALLY have a gun. If it has parts that can be manipulated, you can manipulate them. Things like safety switches, hammers and even spinning a revolver cylinder around. Learning how to quickly reload a weapon in a combat situation is one of the main challenges of the game.\n\nThere are 2 kinds of enemy, each posing their own threats. After playing for a few hours you'll learn to either hate or fear the beep sound they make when they spot you.\n\nOverall this is a very enjoyable game and is great for killing time.","March 4, 2014","true","15.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Moderately difficult gun mechanics. Interesting grim and cyberpunkish ambiance despite it's low-budget nature. Rogue-like, enemies hitting you means instant-death, hence very challenging, I couldn't beat the game yet. Things often go smoothly for some while, where knowing the buttons halfway through is enough to know. More often than not you'll find yourself facing multiple enemies at once - hovering shock drones that hunt you down, and stationary sentry turrets - with only a few bullets left in your magazine, choosing to either fight or run. This can put you under some stress and make you panic. It's where the wheat is probably seperated from the chaff in this game.

Theres also two types of enemies A mind tech turret and a mind tech drone. The game is really fun and the gun mechanics really spice up the gameplay. The first time you reaload your gun you feel the biggest satisfaction. Now about the gameplay. The gameplay is really tight and works fluid. But the difficulty  is insanely difficult.

You actually have to manually operate your weapon.\n\nThe game is procedurally generated with regards to the placement of enemies, ammunition, and the objective collectibles.\n\nYour success can depend on what weapons, equipment and however much ammo you start with, all of which are random. You can start with anything from a .44 with a dozen rounds, or a 9mm with three measley bullets.\n\nThe gunplay is satisfying and tactile, and the game is arranged such that you won't need to do the dozen things involved with operating a gun in a hurry. The pace is slow, and you have as much time as you like to get ready.\n\nIt's possible to get up a list of keyboard commands on screen to help you know what to press and what does what.\n\nIn all, a great concept, very well designed. Hopefully we see more like this in the future, with more scenarios perhaps, or some sort of multiplayer deathmatch.\n\nVery good price for a couple of hours fun.

Confusing controls. Buggy help. Even at the lowest possible graphical settings i was getting 10 fps. i can play tf2 1080p on max settings so why are there issues with this? Perhaps with a source engine port and fixed controls, i could enjoy this one.\n\nTo be fair, the difficulty needs to be lowered. An infinite amount of loose bullets would be nice, and "lean" keys so that i could see a turret and not get shot in the face. Also there is no damage gradient, i.e., you are either dead or not, you are not "injured", you are killed.\n\nAlso, there are no nice touches, like smoke at the end of your gun. Needs some artistic work. It seems it wants to be tf2-esque whenever you look at the enemies up close, but the gun models, tape models, bullet models, all seem to be trying to be too realistic, especially in a game where the main objective is to scavenge 80's Walkman tapes and take out cartoony turrets, all the while trying to scavenge and conserve ammo.\n\nThe most offensive part is that there is no fov slider. I feel uncomfortable when i have literally 20 things around the map that can one-hit me that I need to seek out, wit the range of vision Helen Keller has when she is wearing a cone collar. And she's not only blind, deaf, and further restricted by the cone collar, but she's also dead.\n\nBut the controls, oh! the controls. There needs to be a lot of double-binding. i.e.- bind opening and closing the cylinder or attaching/removing the magazine should be the same button. It's not helped by trying to decipher what key does what in the help menu when it is layered on top of itself.\n\nIf you fixed these things, maybe i would try it out again.\n\nVerdict: decide on a artistic style, simplify the controls, optimize optimize optimize, add some features, lower the difficulty, and reconsider some of the existing features.\n\nSuggestions: Make a story either of\n\nA) an 80's cop fighting crime on the streets ( all of the guns in the game already existed in the time period,) where it stressed the difficulty of actually following procedure and how deadly the fighting was.\n\nor\n\nB) a brightly colored ultra-difficult stealth game where one must find and collect the walkman tapes or whatever. Might be sci-fi or 80's themed.\n\nI don’t know what's best for the game. But here are some pointers in the right direction.\n\nBTW, I realize that this was made in a 7 day thing or whatever. I just don’t think it's complete enough for it to be called a game. A hugely expansive, elaborative, and intracite demo/proof of concept, not a game. There just aren't enough mechanics for it to be called a game. Simulator? Loose use of the word, my friend.","January 1","false","0.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

Better controls, and more things to do besides walking around shining a flashlight and seeing 3 robot turrets would have helped. It is cool they are putting more focus on actually operating a gun, but more time could have been taken to optimize it and improve the controls and make it easier, more fun, and fluid.

Tactifag","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cxero/","76 products in account",">>Hey fanboys, can you stop putting thumbs down because I don't like your silly video game? I'm fairly certain most of you giving this a thumbs down have already bought the game /before/ I put this review here.\n\nReceiver is an interesting firearms simulator video game but it falls short of it's goals with poor execution. I suppose you get what you pay for. Don't always expect just $5 to get you a good video game.\n\nGAMEPLAY: You spawn in a random location with a random pistol with a random amount of ammo. The goal is to find six randomly-placed casette tapes in a randomly-generated map with randomly-placed robot enemies (taser-bots & stationary machine gun turrets). There's ammo randomly placed around the map. You must manipulate every part of your gun with your keyboard. There's no lean feature, so you must expose your entire body in order to get a few shots off at a robot. Considering that you die no matter where you are shot, this becomes extremely problematic. The randomly-generated maps don't fit the gameplay well; you can easily get stuck in odd places thanks to the bizzare level design. Stairs are nightmarish.\n\nPRESENTATION: The game is full of plain, blank textures which have no depth whatsoever. Low-detail textures can look good sometimes (see: Unturned) but this game is trying to create a realistic apartment complex. Without the textures, though, every surface looks like plastic. The skybox is low detail and ugly as sin. The sound effects and music are good, but unfortunately, do little to correct the visual sins.\n\nSTORY: Hardly any story at all. The little story you can get is from the randomly-placed casette tapes. It's just a guy reading from a script in the most boring and monotonous voice thought possible. It sounds like he just got up at 6:30 AM and didn't have his coffee yet.\n\nTHE VERDICT: You should really shell out some extra money in order to get you a better video game. This game doesn't teach you much about actually fighting since there's no human enemies. You can learn how to work a pistol, but if you're the kind of guy who finds this game interesting, you should already know how to use a gun.","November 2, 2014","false","3.2"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","0"

I'm calling "Receiver" a concept, for I'm sure it is not a game. Really, it's not entertaining for one bit, if you don't look at it like on "anti-Call-of-Duty" project.\nIn my line of values one should not ask money from other people to look at the thing like Receiver. So I suggest not to buy it even for 1$.\nIf you are really want to know how different guns are operating, try a game which called World of Guns: Gun Disassembly. It gives much more clear view on the whole shooting thing.

It was created in 7 days.  It is almost entirely about handling guns in an extremely complex and realistic fashion.  It is also about randomly-assembled levels, and listening to cassette tapes, and not being able to see anything.  In some ways it's the very definition of a proof-of-concept game.  The focus is set squarely on the novelty of manipulating firearms realistically.  Everything else is sparse window dressing.  But then, that "everything else" isn't necessarily bad.  It's highly unique as well.  So in that sense Receiver is more than just a proof-of-concept game... but it's less than a game.

Can I recommend this as a "game" though?  No.  Games are fun, this really isn't.  It doesn't even really try; there's no score-keeping or anything.\n\nWhile you fumble about  struggling with the aiming, you're shot once and die.  Or you fall 8-10 feet from one floor to the next and die.  Or you spawn without ammo and you die.  You forgot to unlock the safety and you die.  The enemies are more accurate shots, faster, and more agile than you, so you die.  Speaking of the safety - you can toggle the switch for it, but it doesn't clue you to what is on or off.  So, that's awesome, and yes I died because of it.  Then there's the pointlessness of the flashlight, the badly implemented randomization of levels, gun and ammo.  And you die so quickly that any progress you've made in collecting the tapes is gone.  Enemies take multiple shots to take down - you require one to be brought down.  And if they wanted to make it about realistic gun mechanics then why aren't your hands and arms visible during gun manipulation?  Instead you see the oddness of floating objects in your field of view.\n\nYa know, I'm not in the least bothered by the lack of graphical polish, or the lack of variety in enemies, or it's lack of depth overall (outside of the gun-mechanics, I mean), but it could at least have been fun, which it's not.  I'm not convinced it was ever meant to be either, which is fine so long as you don't call it a game.  I know some have talked about how the muscle-memory building aspect of emptying the shells from your gun and reloading without thinking about it is one of the key points of 'Receiver' that people seem to miss.  I get it, I do.  Some people find simulation of tedious actions fun.  And these particular tedious actions would be fun were the game environment and the enemies encountered also depicted with the same level of realism that the gun mechanics are.  Dying from dropping 8 feet is unlikely in real life.  Even being hit by a single bullet isn't going to necessarily stop you or kill you in real life.  And the aiming mechanic is so unwieldy that finding your mark on those flying tazer-drones is a ♥♥♥♥♥.  And the ultimate goal from suffering through all of this is???  Collecting some cassette tapes.  It's 2014.  I don't even own a cassette player.  There is nothing of interest to keep one coming back except the muscle-memory building, for which there is no score-keeping.  I mean, make me Agent 47 with an objective to assassinate an evil dictator or something and I will gladly struggle with the mechanics to get it done.  Give me points for how quickly I manipulate parts of the weapon correctly...  something!\n\nLong explanation short:  It's just not fun.","October 19, 2014","false","0.4"," 5 of 19 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","5","19","0","0"

The game while fun, has some major performance issues. I will often be on an important part of the game when suddenly I start to get major lag. This should not be happening on a game like this, as the graphics are not even that good. This takes away from much of the game's fun. When the game is not lagging (something which is a rare commodity) it is extremely fun to play. When you encounter a flying mind tech you feel this true sense of fear for your life as you either fight or run. Shooting and reloading the gun is rather interesting because every single part of the gun is controllable. While this adds uniqueness to the game it slows the pace down considerably and has nothing to help speed it up.\n\nThe verdict: An exciting and adrenaline pumping experiment that is hindered majorly by its massive performance issues. While the game is fun to play it badly needs to be optimized. If you have beast gaming computer or something "good enough" to run most games, then I would definitely recommend picking this up!\n\nOverall rating: 6/10\n\nPresentation: 5/10\nGameplay: 7/10\nGraphics: 5/10\nSound: 8/10\nDifficulty: 8/10\nLasting Appeal: 6.5\n\nOverall rating: 6/10","October 13, 2013","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The detailed gun mechanics were frustrating at first but gave a sense of accomplishment once I got the patterns down.  (I often found myself compulsively checking the colt/glock to make sure a round was chambered and spinning the revolver cylinder "for luck" before snapping it shut.)\n\nThe randomized tapes remind me a little of Dear Esther's non-linear storytelling (if someone did a Dear Esther/Receiver mashup, I would buy that in a heartbeat :)\n\nIf you are frustrated by making mistakes and learning through trial-and-error, you will probably not enjoy this game.  To get anywhere, you will die and restart.  A lot.  Bullets are scarce, and you die in one hit, so it's not a game for people who want to rush around blowing things away.  Much of my enjoyment of the game came from efficient use of those scarce bullets and outwitting the drones.\n\nIf you are interested in game design and how design decisions and minimalist storytelling affect the player experience, this is definitely worth a look.","June 1, 2014","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found being able to intimately interact with my gun, rather then just pressing one button to reload and one to shoot like in most games, very enticing. I hope this guy, whoever he is, gets the funding to make a bigger game because he definitely has potential as a game designer and should be given the chance to shine.\nBut here's where the game gets bad:\nThe level design is terrible. The game built around finding tiny objects that could easily be looked over by the untrained eye in these maze-like, nonsensical building structures.\nThe gunplay that involves actually SHOOTING your gun is awful. When your ENTIRE, ♥♥♥♥ING, GAME, revolves around a gun, you better make sure that when you get around to actually shooting your damn gun that it's precise! If the gunplay isn't precise in your game about shooting a gun then you have failed in a very crucial aspect of your game.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for games that portray guns as unreliable and imprecise, but ONLY if using a gun is an OPTION in the game, not the ONLY WEAPON YOU HAVE!\nSome people will really like this game, I can imagine that a lot of people will enjoy the challenges that it presents, I didn't.\nDoes that make it a bad game? No, by no means. Pick it up and find out for yourself, it's cheap enough to where, even if you don't like it, you'll at least be giving money to a developer who has good ideas.\n...\nOh, and ♥♥♥♥ THOSE FLYING BOTS!!!!!!!!!!!","February 8, 2015","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No updates makes me bummed out.\n\nReciever is, if nothing else, an awesome experiment in gun mechanics and gameplay. It's fun, and there's a level of challenge to it that no other game I've played has been able to recreate. It is empowering to come back to this game after a few weeks away and remembering keystroke-for-keystroke how to check the ammo in my gun and reload it.\nNote on optimization: Yes, this game will be laggy on almost anything you try to play it on. It's also worth noting that this game was made in 7 days. Updates are sure to come in the future, and the game's performace will be better for it.

This game was made for the 7-Day FPS challenge in which, as the name implies, is a callenge to game makers to create a First Person Shooter (FPS) in 7 days. And you know, its actually pretty good! So why am i giving this a low score? The game is just annoying to play to be honest. I know what you're thinking, "Hey Vandal, if you say this game is pretty good then why did you just say its annoying? You just completely contradidcted to what you just said!", well allow me to explain reader. What i meant by that was that its a good PROTOTYPE. This is what the game feels like, plays like, and looks like. This game honestly should be a Free to Play tech demo. Not a game worth $5! The game is also procedurly generated. Which means that, the level will be randomized with each playthrough. Now on other games that sounds good (i.e. Being Minecraft, Starbound, Binding of Isaac) but on this game it just fails to impress. Sometimes I spawn with a flashlight, the gun, about 4 fully stocked mags, and with the cassete tape in one room (You have to collect these things for god knows why). And sometimes i spawn with absolutly nothing! The other thing that makes this game bad is its TERRIBLE narrorator. In video games narrorators are supposed to retell past events, present events (Trine series), or just quirky narration (The Stanly Parable). The narrator in this game sounds like he was forced to do this. As in he sounds he hasnt gotten any sleep in months and is bored out of their mind on the brink of insanity.\n\nPros:\n-Looping music is catchy\n-Guns are replicated good\n-Guns sounds are almost real\n\nCons:\n-Game suffers from confusing gameplay\n-Virtually no story if any\n-Horrible narrator\n-Not worth the $5\n-EXTREMELY CONFUSING controls\n-Bland textures\n-Crap hit detection\n\nThe Final Verdict: 4/10\nI am being greatly generous with that rating. The game is not the worst game on pc (in my opinion at least) but it's definitely up there. I cant say anything else worth mentioning other than the fact that i can go on and on ranting about how the game shouldve been free instead of it costing money. I refuse to recommend this game to players unless you're a gun nut. If thats the case disregard this review and go buy - HANG ON NO DONT BUY IT! If you are a gun enthusiast, the look up "World Of Guns: Gun Dissasembly". At least there you can go crazy on numerous guns. The game would be better if it was still being in development by the dev team. In conclusion the game is not good. I know I dont have the right to say that since i only played it for about 6 mins. the uninstalled it. But in my opinion, unless the team makes a better version of the game, this game will forever be the worst game i have ever played.\n\nEven "Dead Bits" was a better game than this.\n\n-Evan","January 30, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
