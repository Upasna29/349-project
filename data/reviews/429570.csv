If you loved those games as much as I did, however, you'll ignore all negative reviews and THEN play this game anyway... maybe you won't even be as disappointed in every other character not named Michonne as I was.\n\nThe first season of The Walking Dead added punch and weight to your consequential life and death, ethical and moral decisions because of the presence of a small child in your care. I wrestled with my choices far longer than I would have in a game like Dragon Age or Mass Effect for fear of the impact on the excellently voiced little girl. I wasn't just playing for Lee, I was playing for Clementine.\n\nThe second season placed you in the role of Clementine, and even though I found the conclusion muddy and uneven (depending on the ending you got; mine was a headscratcher), seeing the zombie apocalypse from the point of view of this weirdly expert child was novel and engaging to me. I'd become invested in her journey.\n\nHere in Michonne's tale we have the most visually iconic character of the The Walking Dead canon front and center. Though they couldn't get Danai Gurira to voice her, Samira Wiley does an excellent job. The cast as a whole, like previous games, creates a strong ensemble of voices. There are some truly excellent performances. The dialog felt naturalistic, like things a real person might say; however, the one-sentence descriptions the game gives you of your choices led me into some confusing turns of conversation. They pack so much interchange and well-directed camera cuts that I sometimes couldn't see how my choice was connected with where the story next went, though I was entertained enough to shrug and carry on.\n\nThe whole of this first episode feels like the first half of one of those television pilots where characters are introduced in the first segment that you get no time to know; but, by the second commercial break there are a whole new set of people with more names to immediately forget. My game time is 95 minutes (as of this writing) on Steam, but five of those were making a sandwich. In that ninety minute running time, my only investment was in the faithful and effective portrayal of Michonne.\n\nThis leads into a conceit that breaks one of the primary rules of The Walking Dead franchise: anyone can die.\n\nExcept since this story is sandwiched in comic book canon and Michonne is in the title and all that, we know she can't possibly die; so, without investment in secondary characters or some larger, laudable goal, I didn't feel any motivation or jeopardy other than being directly antagonized by "bad guys". I didn't care if I saw any of the characters from the opening again. Furthermore, I didn't want to see half the characters they'd introduced in the second half of the episode at all.\n\nIf the second episode connects me with some of these characters, I could see revising my review. Right now, though, I'd advise anyone who hasn't played TellTale Games's The Walking Dead seasons one and season two (yes, in that order) to play those instead.\n\nAs for the people who've played the other two excellent TellTale games, nothing I'm going to write will stop you from playing this one. It looks far better than the previous games, though the hard black shading meant to mimic the comic book looks like multiple melanoma or a dark chocolate misfortune on several of the characters. Norma, in particular, was jarring and confusing to my eye, as if she'd had wrinkles tattooed on her wrinkles.\n\nI loved the song, all foot-stomping low-fi roots.\n\nThough The Walking Dead: Michonne had some excellent performances, cinematography and some badass machete play, it left me not wanting more, but empty from it passing right through me due to a lack of substantial characters to care about.","March 1","false","3.0"," 215 of 272 people (79%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","79","215","272","12","11"

The game itself, tries to expand ever slightly on the gameplay that we have come to love, in the walking dead, yet ultimately fails to impress. The other characters themselves, fail to offer any sort of interesting qualities that would bring the player to become attached to them or become upset, should they be killed off.\n\nAnother piece that made the walking dead games so iconic is the drastic effects decision making can have regarding the life or death of a character. Choices in this game have little to no effect on the ultimate outcomes (in episode 1), and even if they did, as I mentioned, no one would care if a character dies.\n\nThe real question is not whether or not this game is good, but whether or not we should really care about the characters, their stories or what occurs in the game.","March 2","false","0.5"," 144 of 206 people (70%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","70","144","206","7","20"

I am not saying it was a bad game, but it was definitely bad Telltale title. Probably one of the worst and sure not worth it's money due to the fact that you can complete the whole series in about 4 hours and the game itself have no replay value because this time choices really does not matter at all. Yes, in TT games we got used to that ilusion of choice but this time it even feels offensive have this much lack of proper choice and how it matters. And while being comic fan for a long time i can't say this game brings something new to the TWD universe because there are no references to the comic book and nothing that will happen actually matter or connect with it (that's why you simply can't care more what's happening to Michonne here). Simply put, this game looks more like an excuse to make some cash before TWD Season 3. But even tho, the action in game looks pretty much cinematic and thrilling (but with the same engine it's still feels a little bit chubby and awkward). It's a good game for one evening and better take it when it's going to be on sale. Or if you are looking for better TT game experience i suggest getting Tales from the Borderlands or GoT game.","April 26","false","4.3"," 54 of 66 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","54","66","2","3"

But right now I cannot recommend it.\n\nYou have almost no control over your character. There are 2 areas in the game were you can walk around a bit (really only a bit). The rest of the game the only thing you do is choose a dialog option and do some quick time events. I would have wished there are more areas were I can controll my character and explore the game at my own pace.\n\nThe choices do not matter at all (go through windows or take ladder is one BIG choice, seriously?). In TWD season one there are some options that result in which character lives - granted the choices were never very significant - but this feels like an all-time low.\n\nFurthermore the character development does not happen we switch between different areas too fast and get seperated from characters to often to built up any meaningfull relationship or get to know the characters a bit. This leads to emotional scenes not having the impact they should have.\n\nAnd worst if you suceed in a quick time event or not does not matter for at least 3 events were I failed. Example: press down so Michonne ducks but if you don't guess what happens: she ducks. Press Y and Michonne gives Randall a headbutt but if you don't press Y she gives him.... you get the idea.\n\nI loved all other Telltale games, played through TWD Season 1 3 times, loved Borderlands, 400 days, TWD Season 2 - you name it.

The choices in TWD:Michonne are so clearly 'illusions of choice' (no matter what you choose the outcome would be the same) and with this in mind I tried my very best to choose the most gung-ho options to see if i could divert the game from it's very strict narrative.\n\nSeason 2 - and by extension TWD:Michonne - are brilliant stories, but they are just that, stories. Stories you watch and occasionally are compelled by an on-screen prompt to push a particular button to keep the story moving... This is fine if you go into TWD:Michonne with the expectations of an interactive story, but if you want something clever a la season 1, you will be bitterly dissapointed not only by the game's length but also it's depth. The story in TWD:Michonne is bland and one we have seen before; it is a carbon copy of the Carver story in season 2. Because of the episode's short runtime, it was also difficult to feel any emotion to the characters when they died, and ultimatums provided to me felt hollow and made previous conversations invalid.\n\nIn conclusion, if each of the 3 episodes is an hour long each, I feel TellTale would've been wiser to release them as one 3 hour long standalone than break it up into bits. Furthermore, the engine TellTale use needs to be put to rest in favour of a superior one, as FPS drops were indiscriminate of whether I was in combat or a conversation, and the load time between areas of the world is ridiculous, especially whewn I have an i7 proccessor that should be able to run this perfectly multiple times over.\n\nNot impressed TellTale, season 3 better go back to season 1's style of actual multiple choices.\n\nThis is a joke.","February 25","false","1.4"," 67 of 92 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","67","92","3","10"

So this text isn't made by a stubborn hater who has no clue about the topic at all. To clearify this: I really liked the comic series and at least the first seasons of the TV show. I especially loved the first game and even if it was a bit less awesome, I enjoyed TWD season 2 by Telltale as well. So I gladly purchased the Michonne spin off the moment I saw it and got really excited about this.\n\nSo now, after playing the first episode in about one and a half hour, I sadly have to say, that I can't recommend it. At least not if I keep in mind how blown away I was by other TT games - above all TWD season one. I shed tears, I laughed, I had to make hard decisions,I watched the characters grow and I saw them leaving the stage for good. Also, even if the ending never really differs, I felt like my choices mattered in a way.\nAnd not to forget I felt like playing an actual GAME.\n\nBut here? The characters have the potential to make you feel with them, but the storytelling was way less intense than in the previous games. Everything felt rushed and shallow. Also, it didn't feel like a game anymore. No real puzzles, no activity at all. You barely do anything more than pressing Q und E in way too many quicktime events and rush trough dialogues where your choices and answers don't seem to matter in a single possible way. Instead you only thing you see is an achievement every 10-20 minutes popping out for doing nothing than clicking the skip button, leaving you wondering how the past minutes count as a chapter of a story that intends to be exciting. The cliffhanger itself isn't that bad, but the teaer of the next episodes spoilers enough content for you to not be excited about how the conflict will end.\n\nThe art stlye and music are very similar to the previous games and therefore appealing to me. But as TWD always was heavily storydriven, these facts don't really influence the general impression.\n\nAgain, I am a fan. Of both, TT and TWD. This is why it's hard for me to write these lines. BUT I am off the opinion that the players have the right to expect some quality time for the money they spend. In this case, this just isn't given to me. Maybe you are better of buying the whole game at a high discount price in the far future. And if you didn't play the other TWD, just do it. Now. I myself plan on playing the first season a second time soon and probably feel nostalgic and overwhelmed by the magical feeling it provides all over again. TWD Michonne had ALL the right material to let people feel that exact same way when playing. But at the very moment, for what this game is, I think you rather don't.","February 23","false","1.7"," 75 of 109 people (69%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","69","75","109","9","0"

If you played The Walking Dead Seasons 1 and 2, be prepared to be very disappointed with this mini series.\n\nFor one thing, the main selling point of this game, also known as "choices" do absolutely nothing. They are entirely superficial and do nothing to impact gameplay in any matter. I spent the entire game trying to look out for any impact of my choices, but there was close to almost nothing.\n\nWhat little impact my choices had, was entirely superficial as well. For example, depending on your choices on the last episode, some of your "group" may or may not be killed. But the thing is, I'm not even given the chance to talk to him, much less even get attached to him. So when a particular member was shot, I just stared at the screen with the "Oh, so that happens. Okay." emotion rather than the "OH GOD HE GOT SHOT NOOO" emotion.\n\nAnd that is another point I want to criticise as well: No character development with almost all characters. Maybe except for Pete and Sam, but for the rest, you almost can't even speak to them a single sentence.\n\nThe ending "choice" is based on your decision to stay with your daughters or not, which I find is  the most ridiculous decision of them all. The "daughters" have been nothing but an annoyance so far for me, popping up at the most inopportune times to almost get me killed. What's more annoying about these "daughters" is that the hallucinations randomly flash here and there from time to time, and it HEAVILY breaks the immersion for me. So when it came to the "finale" choice on whether or not to ditch these annoying little buggers to escape a BURNING HOUSE, well... F yeah I'll ditch them in a heartbeat! This greatly disappointed me because the finale was suppose to be the hardest decision to make in the entire game!\n\nI tried really hard to like this game, I really did.

I think what matters is the way those choices make the player feel at the moment. In hindsight one can play several times through the story and see that the choices don't really matter, but when the player experiences it for the first time, the player doesn't know what will happen or what the outcome is going to be. That what makes these games good - feeling that the choices matter as they are happening, not after the fact.

What makes the miniseries different is that it contains 3 episodes instead of 5 (or in some cases 6) in a season. The price is however cheaper, since there's less content. Michonne is a well-known character if you've watched the TV-show the walking dead or read the comics. This story takes place between issues 126-139 in the comic book.\n\nAfter playing the other walking dead games (season 1, DLC 400 days, season 2) I immediately recognized the gameplay and style, in a good and a bad way. I'm getting somewhat tired of the QTE (quick time events) even though they have improved them in terms of sound and animation. The camera can be a little off sometimes and moving around feels clunky.\n\nWhat Telltale games are good at though is the story part, so let me explain that. Michonne is hallucinating about her kids and thinking back into the past. Every now and then you'll get a flashbacks and get parts from the backstory. Michonne tries to fight these hallucination while struggling with zombies and trying to get her and her crew to stay alive. I think the story started out a little boring, but halfway into the first episode things took off and it got very exciting towards the end of the first episode.\n\nVoice-acting is good as expected with telltale games. Michonne is a badass character, just like in the show and comics. The problem with this miniseries format however is that the side-characters doesn't really get your attention. It's such a short game that I can't remember any of their names, even though they had good voice-acting and fit well. That makes some decision less powerful and simply flat. That might be the biggest downside to this short story.\n\nGraphics haven't changed a bit from what I can see. It's another Telltale game. I really wish that they could upgrade the engine more to make the story more engaging and believable. It's okay, but could be much better in terms of details, facial-expressions, etc. I really liked the music in this game, so much that I have to go look it up.\n\nEvery episode is only about 1 hour long, so you can finish the entire game in 3-4 hours. Whether or not that is worth the asking price is a difficult question to answer. It's a decent game that telltale-fans will surely enjoy, as well as story-driven players that wan't something more focused on story then gameplay. If you are not certain, wait for a sale. For the walking dead fans this is something that will distract them from the wait of season 3, while also giving them more backstory about the world and different characters. Not a brilliant game, but a quite good story that kept me playing until the end.","May 19","true","3.9"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","0"

The story and characters are spot on like any of their best sellers. But there is not much else to say about the game because the most important episode to get people interested in the game was a huge disappointment in length. After trying to extend my play time to the limit by exploring each area I still couldn't get the episode to clock over an hour. I know Michonne is a mini-series, but given how short episodes have been in their older titles I assumed this would be a little longer. They made a similar mistake with their game Minecraft: Story Mode, a game in which no dedication or effort was required. Only a pastime and money grab for Telltale Games to fund their larger projects, and I fear Michonne will be such a game while most of us would have preferred that they've skipped this mini-series and put even more time and manpower in The Walking Dead: Season Three and possibly give us an earlier release. Hopefully they read feedback and increase the length of their episodes, I will not try to judge the game in all based on one poorly made episode... yet. But don't be mistaken and don't think that this game will be your normal The Walking Dead game by Telltale Games, this will most likely be a very rushed and short game with a vague story for them to fund upcoming releases.","February 25","false","4.3"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","19","29","0","0"

Yeah this one has none of those things.\nIf you read the comic you'll know how tough Michonne is already (and if she comes back from this venture or not)... at times this game feels like it's going in a Metroid: Other M direction where a strong female character HAS to be weak on the inside due to maternal instincts... it can work but it doesn’t work at all here really.\nIn this case, Michonne has the same basic hallucination elements about fifteen times an episode (which feels like once every five minutes) and after a while seems to be for padding the time of the game rather than adding anything interesting, by episode 3 I was groaning every time it started.\nIt's not all bad; there was some effort obvious in the game and the voice acting is pretty good and there's some nice scenic camera work and shots ... which is nice when the game’s FPS is actually above 20 and it’s had its one-or-two-times-an-episode-twenty-second-hang over and done with.\nTellTale can't just sit on their previous success and make half-arsed things that vaguely resemble that success and expect it to work forever, people will wise up eventually and then what?\nHere's hoping they're going to be making Season 3 better optimized, with updated graphics, animations and with actual choices.","April 30","false","4.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It requires little to no thinking compared to the other games in the series, and the emotional impact is largely missing. The game basically plays itself.\n\nThe biggest problem is really by comparison. Looking at a single episode of The Walking Dead Season 1 or 2, or another high quality Telltale game like The Wolf Among Us, Michonne is really lacking in meaningful choices. While there might be mini, immediate consequences to your actions, they don't last. The branching paths of the story seem to be glued together, coming apart for only for brief moments to give you the barest illusion of control. For a company that prides itself on making these sorts of games, Telltale seems to have forgotten the single most important aspect: agency.\n\nLacking that, the game should have at least told a good story. Sadly there were only a few lazy attempts at evoking feelings for Michonne's backstory. The primary driving action happening in the current timeline was a rote recitation of any equally forgettable story set in the The Walking Dead universe.\n\nThe graphics and sound are standard fare if you've played anything by Telltale before. No surprises there. Although I will say that the update with third episode improved the visuals slightly compared to the first and second parts. The controls are equally similar and unnoteworthy.\n\nIf you are a huge fan of The Walking Dead and/or Telltale and you've already played everything else then it's probably worth a quick playthrough.

Michonne is one of my favourite characters in the TV show, and I thought it would be cool to play as her, so why did I not like this game?\n\n•	Telltale's games have always had limited "gameplay" (for example the QTE based combat), but they usually make up for it with an entertaining story. This game's story was kinda boring.\n•	None of the supporting characters were interesting. There isn't really any explanation for who they are or what they're trying to do. This game is linked to the comics storyline, which I've never read, so maybe I've missed something. But the consequence was that I never cared about any of them. And if I don't care whether the characters live or die, the main strength of The Walking Dead disappears.\n•	The game is extremely short, at 3.5 hours. Yeah, I know its a mini series. But there are 3 episodes, so the length should be almost double. Tales From The Borderlands and Game of Thrones were roughly 2 hours per episode. The Walking Dead season 2 was 1.5 hours per episode. If the episodes were longer, the above two points might not have been a problem, because the story could be more complex and there would be more time to get to know the characters.\n•	Telltale's games usually force the player to make tough choices that affect the story. This game doesn't really have that. The only significant choices here are "should I kill the bad guy or let him live?", which is never a choice for me. (The answer is always yes, otherwise they'll just try to kill you again later).\n•	The extremely rare occasions that you get to walk around and explore are a waste of time. Most of the places where you can interact with the environment are pointless, because Michonne just stares silently at the object for 5 seconds and then moves on. These interaction points are supposed to be an opportunity to hear the main character's thoughts and learn more about a character or the world.\n•	Most action sequences have a completely unnecessary black bars / letterboxing effect that covers roughly 1/3 of the screen. I guess its supposed to look "cinematic", but I just think it looks stupid.\n\nI guess if you wait for a deep sale there are worse ways to spend an afternoon, but ultimately you won't miss anything if you skip it. Hopefully this is just a temporary blip in form for Telltale.","May 15","false","3.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

I LOVE the Telltale games. They're mostly all amazing and full of great decisions. This one though, was awful. Notice my play time by any chance? Yeah. I finished the entire game. The reason I actually have this much is because I went afk for half an hour once. There was no challenge, almost none of the characters died, and overall, the game was really, REALLY SHORT. Apparently there are 8 endings based on what you do, but I got the best ending on the first try and in order to get one of the worst you have to make the DUMBEST FINAL DECISION in the game. Only a 7% of people made the dumb choice, probably just to find out what it was more than anything else. Also, the game ends in the same way every time, with only slight dialog changes based on who lives and who dies.\nLet's recap the episodes without spoilerinos (for the most part)\nEpisode 1: Characters are introduced, bad guys are introduced, some unimportant guy dies (or two.)\nEpisode 2: Characters escape bad guys, find safe area, safe area gets raided, but they defend and take a hostage.\nEpisode 3: THE ONLY GOOD EPISODE IN THE ENTIRE GAME. This is practically the only place where choices matter. You make big desicions here which vary your endings, but only one of them is an actually hard desicion to make, because there was no obvious answer (unlike the rest of them.) Cool ♥♥♥♥ goes down here.\n\nOverall, the game was not worth it. If you could buy episode three by ITSELF, then maybe you'd have a nice 5$ telltale game. The episodes were about 30 minutes each, with a lot of uninteresting characters and a half-decent story. If you want a good game to buy and you haven't already, buy the walking dead games SEASON 1 AND 2. Those were the most beautifully crafted story games I've ever played. This however, was not.\n\nTLDR: Uninteresting, REALLY, REALLY SHORT, and sadly, not worth your time.\n\nI hope you have something better next time, Telltale. I really love your games, and I hope that your next game(s) are better.","May 3","false","2.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/recommended/429570/","aussiedroid","Aussiedroid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/","744 products in account","One feature that stands The Walking Dead: Michonne (TWD:M) out from its predecessors was the fantastic blending of the flashbacks, visions & main story arcs. I really like how this was done, often occurring at unexpected moments seamlessly merging the stories together, where actions in both worlds are linked. The visions Michonne experiences are rather creepy with a strong horror movie feel, & with some nice post effects to help you distinguish when the focus changes.\n\nThe flashbacks & vision sequences were the highlight of what was a rather dull main story. For me, there just weren’t a lot of memorable characters or events. Most of the personalities felt standardised, one dimensional & a bit predictable. This may also be in part due to the shorter three episode length which doesn’t really lend itself to develop the characters too deeply or allow much in the way of twists in the story.\n\nIt’s certainly not all bad though, & as expected there was plenty of zombie killing action throughout to keep things moving swiftly along. Some of these fights were very impressive, with creative use of the 3D rotating camera & bullet time for many of the larger scenes, & the occasional rare button combo spots that can throw you off balance. I do wish there were more combos sections to show off Michonne’s “badassery” & to help increase the difficulty … keeping the player on their toes.\n\nSoundtrack was a fitting & enjoyable addition to the experience with other sound effects & voice acting also top quality.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=697672297\nDanai Gurira[en.wikipedia.org] (who plays Michonne on the TV Show) didn’t do the voice, but I was pleasantly surprised to find voice acting was pretty spot on! Likewise, capturing the personality in the character’s look & animations often reminded me of how Danai may have acted it out on the show.  Animations overall are very good in TWD:M, I didn’t notice any buggy animations, jumpy textures or strange camera work which I have seen in most of the earlier TTG games.  I did however have a few .exe crashes (about 1 crash per chapter) using Steam In-Home Streaming during my play through.\n\nTWD:M is a decent outing, that I would summarise as good but not great. Little short at 3 streamlined chapters, totalling around 3-4hrs of gameplay. It could quite easily have been fleshed out to 5 (or even 6 chapters) as the shorter length, I feel, ultimately works against the story telling & character development. It really needed some more space to give the characters time to show some depth, personality & explore their stories, not to mention the main story arcs further. There was a good balance between action & dialog in what was there, but it was let down a degree by a mediocre story & script.\n\nCertainly still good enough that it’s worth a play (even if Michonne is Kitana-less!), & especially if you are a fan of the Walking Dead.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","June 4","true","4.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","3"

I do. Do I think it's a great achievement compared to the first two Walking Dead series? I don't.\n\nHello, my name is Michonne...\nIn The Walking Dead: Michonne you control - you guessed - Michonne, a black female protagonist. I pretty much like her, despite her (spoiler incoming) flashbacks  of her lost kids. But who am I to judge? I'm not a mother. Nor a father yet (and as things go recently I don't think I will in the near future, but that's my story, not Michonne's).\n\nThat's a nice name\nSo, we have her and our mouse or controller to execute QTEs and make... decisions? Yes, that's my biggest issue with this game: I went through the first episode (at the time of writing that's the only available yet) and I don't really feel I had to make any decisions. We met people and had to choose who am I side with without having any clue who's the good guys here. While I like how the story goes, I feel my choices weightless.\n\nAnd if you end a chapter and you see that about 80 % of the people have this or that choice, then you can tell that developers gave wrong choices to the players' hand. As one of Life is Strange's developer told in a special edition video, you know you gave good decisions to the players when they hesitate what to do. When there's no obvious "good" and "bad" choice. And here comes Michonne with some 20/80.\n\nNorma's nice too...\nFrom a technical viewpoint you got the same thing for the xth time. Maybe the graphics look somewhat nicer than earlier, and we have large floating QTE-symbols this time, the navigation in the menu is still a pain.\n\nPros:\nYou can adjust the subtitle size to your liking (non-native-English TV people will like that)\nI like the story\nI like the theme songs (both at the opening and ending theme)\nI like the protagonist\nCons:\nYou can't turn off vsync\nNavigating in the menu is slow as a snail. You want to try out all 3 subtitle sizes? Good luck as it takes looooong seconds to get back to the menu, open the.. brr..\nIt asked me to register a Telltale account as it comes with some "perks". I did. Now it asks me every time I start the game if I want to enable cloud saves. It also told me I can learn about the "perks" on a URL you can't click on but I decided to just type it in to the browser because I wanted to see the advantages I have now. You can guess nothing's there but your profile. Maybe the only good thing is that you can see a few more choices on the webpage[www.telltalegames.com] than the episode end screen if you are logged in to your account. Decisions like these:\nYou and 76.2% of players.. oh my god. Are you serious? You and 99.7% of players stabbed him with a screwdriver. What the heck, Telltale!? If 99.7 % of your players stab someone with a screwdriver, that means you just hid the other-thing-which-is-not-a-screwdriver so noone could find it or your percentage counter just bugged out. We want real choices!\nWhat's up with these Steam Achievement "Artworks"? "1", "2"? Don't be so lazy. Hire someone to do it properly.\nIs it?\nSummary: Nice story with a nice protagonist. Lazy execution. The reason I recommend it: Despite its obvious flaws, I enjoyed my 2 hours with the first episode.","March 5","true","4.4"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","18","29","3","0"

As someone who hasn't read the comics but rather watched the TV series, I probably didn't appreciate it as much.\n\nFirst off, each episode is roughly an hour long. While I get that it's a miniseries, it still feels like it's way too short for the price you're paying. Telltale does however deliver with stunning graphics and an amazing soundtrack and VA.\n\nHonestly I think I felt annoyed more than anything while I was playing. Half of the time you ended up with Michonne having hallucinations/flashbacks and seeing her daughters right in the middle of what should be important events. It took away from the events that were happening in real time. Maybe if I read the comics I would understand more but for someone who didn't, everything felt so vague in this series. It's like they put more time into the action scenes than the story itself. Seeing Michonne in action is cool and all but I'd prefer learning more about her. The story was decent but it wasn't engaging in any sort of way. When I started playing it seemed interesting but soon after I found myself wondering when it would be over.\n\nThe characters introduced have no real character development for you to get invested in them. Any interaction you have with 90% of the characters lasts only for a moment and then it's over. At no point would you feel any kind of attachment to them so whether or not they die doesn't really matter to you. Overall the characters felt bland.\n\nAlso, the whole 'choice's matter' really doesn't apply to this game. At least with the other two series your actions and dialog affect your gameplay to a degree. In this series it doesn't matter if Pete or Sam will remember what you said. Literally nothing will happen anyway. It also irked me to know that sometimes when you decide not to make a choice, the game will make it for you. Felt like a repeat of Beyond: Two Souls. Your only real big choice is during the finale. Live or stay with your daughters in your hallucination and I'm assuming die. Let's be real, for a big choice, it's practically already made for you. The dialog choices you get are questionable. As I said I never read the comics so I don't know what she was like before but it doesn't feel like anything Michonne would say.\n\nIn terms of recommending the game, I'd say no. It's an okay game but not for $15. You're better off saving that money for something else.  It's a short game so if you get the chance to play it then by all means go for it but just be ready for a bit of disappointment.","May 9","false","6.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It's like someone at Telltale decided that pressing buttons in an interactive story was too difficult, and so was creating the interactive locations we have come to expect from playing other Telltale games.  As a result you get a short, and fairly buggy game...some of the load times may be longer than the chapters you play though which is very frustrating.  This game actually gives The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct a slow zombie shuffle for your money when it comes to clunkiness.   If you liked the other Walking Dead games, wait for a Steam sale and pick this up when it is around $5, otherwise pass on it and save your money for another game.","April 26","false","4.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

If you enjoy other TellTale games and want something story based, pick this game up because it is not awful but you also aren't missing anything by skipping it.\n\nI've noticed that TellTale games seem to include less actual gameplay with every release - apparently they've said they want to be more like HBO which is fine - but unfortunately this means a lot of interactivity is going to be Quick Time Events. And oh boy, this game has a lot of them. It's pretty much dialogue, move a character down a one dimensional path by holding down the appropriate key and then Quick Time Events in action sequences. It's not particularly enjoyable because there's no challenge and if you do ♥♥♥♥ up, which you can if you're not paying attention or just simply hit the wrong key, you die. I agree there should be consequence but I really feel like story based games such as this one should avoid main character death for messing up - because no one wants to have to redo progress in a game like this, it's tedious having to relisten to conversation you've already gone through. ♥♥♥♥ up a quick-time event? Don't kill the player and set them back, incorporate it into the narrative instead.\n\nTalking about the narrative, it isn't that great. Michonne seems like a really great character and I enjoyed playing as her, but being haunted by her past gets old quickly because, until some scenes at the end of episode three, it goes nowhere. You have a main character who keeps seeing her missing children, but it rarely goes beyond that. Michonne freaks out at an inappropriate time, she stumbles around in a dream sequence only to wake up and move on - there's no development. By episode three, I was really bored by this and just did not care. Through-out episode one and two, Michonne sees a toy that belonged to her kids but this ends up being completely forgotten in episode three.\n\nThe episodes are incredibly short too, you can complete each one in roughly one to two hours - this means a lot of character development has been sacrificed. Even your main companions aren't particularly flushed out. Everyone's kind of aware that choices in TellTale games don't have a huge impact and this isn't something I personally am bothered by. However it is definitely noticeable in this one. Spoilers ahead, but in episode two you can decide if Pete should stay with you or go. I explored through both of these options and it's hilarious - Pete barely speaks and lingers in the background, constantly looking out of place - obviously to work with the choice of him not being there.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is okay - if you're conflicted, then pick it up in a sale. I just hope TellTale doesn't continue to make their games like this - I feel they should either stick to how they used with puzzles and exploration or just go full in as a movie with dialogue choices. Instead they're stuck in the middle with Quick Time Events and a lack of challenge, which simply adds very little.","April 27","false","4.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/429570/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1791 products in account","TellTale keep surfing on the wave of interactive stories with QTE sequences. While the previous The Walking Dead games were using characters that weren't from the comic (apart for Hersel and Glenn in the first episode), this mini-serie is focused on one of the most beloved and strong women from the comic (and TV series), Michonne.\n\nMichonne is the machete/katana master and also one of the most trustful for Rick Grimes. She lost her family but kept going on. However, while she suffered from some tortures and ♥♥♥♥, we never saw her being on the edge because of her children. It's after the two years gap, after the war with the Saviors, that we discover a more fragile Michonne, that left Ezechiel, Rick and Alexandria behind to regroup herself. We know that Michonne has a strong friendship with people of her groups (Rick, Andrea, Eugene and the rest), which means that we don't have to worry about her being at their side in the upcoming fight against the Whisperers.\n\nBut if there is a question to ask, it's why Michonne was on a boat and why she felt the need to distance herself with people. And while the mini-series isn't showing how Michonne left people behind, it's giving also a reason to her need to be alone and how she came in contact with Pete and more surprinsing Siddiq, two comics characters (one being still the captain of his boat and the other establishing himself in Alexandria and helping to build the fair). We can suppose that the story is happening early in the two years gap and not in the end.\n\nBefore telling you the contents (without spoiling the story in itself), this is a TellTale game and as they're stuck on one way to play these times, you have to understand that it's the same mechanics behind all the Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us or Tales from the Borderlands: you're listening to characters, you're making your own choices, whether in words or in actions and you may have an impact on the story, though that you're always ending up with the same road: characters you saved from death are generally dying in a following episode (like Carley/Doug saved in Episode 1 but killed in Episode 3 - no matter who you chose to save) or no matter what you choose as action (I think about Sarita in Season 2, no matter the way you save her, Kenny will blame your actions), you'll end up with the same conclusion. It's the same here: during the second episode, stop Pete and he will be at your side, don't stop him, you'll find him alive in Episode 3. And this is not really a spoiler in itself if you're following the comic as he's appearing in it AFTER the mini-series.\n\nAnd among these choices to do, you have also to worry about Michonne and her actions to save herself: you still have to kill walkers, to dodge bullets, to fight or in this case, to deal with the PTSD she's finally showing about her family. The mini-series is also focused on that side: we already knew about Michonne having two daughters who died in the early days of the infection, like we already know how she came to use a machete/katana to survive. However, you have to understand something: Michonne didn't really have time to settle and think about everything as when she becomes part of Rick's group, they didn't have a long time of peace before bloodshed, revolts or enemies (if Michonne was already exhibiting some symptoms in Alexandria, she didn't think about them because of what happened after). Here, after the peace with the Saviors, it was time for rebuilding life with the Kingdom - The Sanctuary - Hilltop Colony - Alexandria. And given the fact that people projected themselves in a relative peace, Michonne had time for herself to think without to stay on her guard. And I suppose that everything came back and that's why she isolated herself. That's also on that that the mini-series is focusing: Michonne reliving that horrible day, hallucinating, seeing her lost daughters, though despite that state of mind, she stayed in the reality as the walkers she was killing in these visions were real. So, you have to expect to see the Michonne we love loosing herself in her memories in the worst moment, though a part of reality is still stuck in her brain.\n\nThe first episode, In Too Deep, is opening on Michonne alone, hallucinating and fighting walkers before meeting Pete. After that, she becomes a member of his crew and find herself answering a distress call. Investigating it with Pete, she'll meet Sam and Greg, brother and sister, themselves on the run from a community called Monroe, ruled by Norma, whose right hand is her violent and sick brother Randall.\n\nThe second episode, Give No Shelter, is telling how the trio (or duo depending on Pete's choice) managed to escape Monroe, though being hunted by the survivors) and came back to Sam's family shelter with all the problems that can be met during the trip (wounds, walkers, etc..).\n\nThe third episode, What We Deserve, is the conclusion of the hunt: Norma and Michonne are willing to discuss to exchange prisoners, however, nothing will happen like both women hoped and it will be the final confrontation. However, it is also time for Michonne to make a choice about her hallucinations: stay in them and risk everyone's life or let them behind and protect everyone.\n\nThe plot is really well-written and showing a side that we may have guess from the comics: her own fragility due to her tragic loss. Michonne is dealing with the past, without risking her group's safety initially as she isolated herself from them. However, with Pete's crew and then with Sam, she's risking everyone's life each time she's submerged by her emotions. TellTale is more into introspecting and feelings than in their other TWD games, even if they're still using the children's cards to add more tension. You already know how the game will finish: Michonne, Pete and Siddiq alive as they're comic characters and that it was clearly stated that the mini-series is happening in the timeline of the comic. The question is: how will you portray Michonne? Who are you willing to sacrifice? What part of you are you willing to let go? I must say that I changed my mind in Episode 3: I did two saves with each different ending for episode 2 and tried to see which one will fit better for the third episode. I surprised myself by choosing definitively the one that I wasn't agreeing first for Michonne. I must say that I was really fed up with Randall's words - the guy is really more infuriating than Carver or Larry.\n\nAs usual, the graphics are cell-shaded, with nothing changing from the previous TWD games (or TellTale's recent games). And the soundtrack is as usual a real pleasure. I really liked the opening - I should even say that I'm very glad to see images from the comics resuming Michonne's life BEFORE the mini-series. It's strengthening the fact that it will not disrespect the comic.\n\nMy only problem is the fact that sometimes, I had to press A for Q as I have an AZERTY keyboard. The result is that I have to press the two keys to see which one I have to use.\n\nAnyway, comics fans will be happy to see at least a media respecting the story, contrary to the TV series that is really taking many liberties with characters, like killing Andrea when she's still alive and an important figure in Rick and Carl's life. While I loved the two first seasons and waiting to see how they will handling the third, I largerly preferred the mini-series, more invested into personal matters and finally tied into the comic. Maybe because it's Michonne and that people having read the comic were in familiar territory but I think that the pair flashback/hallucination/reality is way more interesting than trying to shape Clementine and deal with adults for example.\n\nThe Walking Dead: Michonne is really a must-have for me. It was a real good job done by TellTale.","May 16","true","5.6"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

I just finished the mini series (a few weeks after the final episode came out) , and that's one of the saddest things about it. I usually play new episodes of Telltale series as soon as they come out, but this one was feeling like a bit of a chore. I knew the final episode was out, and every so often, when I thought "Hey, I could play the new epsiode", I would always put it off to later, as I would with a chore. Reasons why I didn't like the game:\n\n- Story is meh. Character building is lacking. I'm not sure how I felt about playing an already existing character. It felt like the choice I had to make were the choices Michonne would have made. This is not how I want to play my Telltales.\n- Telltale's engine is showing signs of age. Unsmooth transition, awkward moments of silence where it feels like the game is trying to catch up, ridiculously long loading times, especially considering that this game's textures are low res (running on a SSD, good luck to HDD users). All these little things just break the immersion.\n- The final choice is a "fake" choice. It shows by the percentage of people that did what I did (92% I think). The other choice was just dumb.\n- The choices you make don't really affect the game all that much, then again last time I felt like my choices had an impact in a Telltale game was at the end of Season 1 of TWD, where your choices would decide which character would follow you at the end.\n\nIn conclusion, the best thing about TWD: Michonne is the theme song...","May 16","false","4.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Michonne side steps this mainly because she’s preexisting and established, but this just creates further issues. What if you don’t hold the knowledge the game assumes you do? Just as bad, what if you do? More than ever before, the final chapter makes it clear that there's a true path you're supposed to take on your way through the choices presented. Deviating from this means making decisions wildly out of Michonne’s character, making the choices you are presented with seem more shallow than ever. I mean, we’ve all played Telltale stuff before and we know there’s never going to be any hugely relevant alterations to the story based on the snap decisions you have to make. The draw has always been in making these on the fly, based on who you’ve decided you want your protagonist to be. But previous protagonists Lee and Clementine didn’t have years of back story living in our heads, telling us that Unthinkable Option 2 is just plain wrong.\n\nThis narrative flaw sadly bleeds into the second half of What We Deserve, where the game stops pretending the other survivors matter and starts exploring the grief and guilt leaking out of Michonne’s malfunctioning mind. The fluttering images of her dead children has been ever-present throughout her mini adventure, always getting worse as the stress and danger ramps up or dies too far down. It’s actually kind of brilliant, purposefully muddying what’s real and what’s imagined. The rapid-fire cuts and changes do more than just stick two creepy kids somewhere in the background, like a pair of preadolescent Slendermen with braids. They force you down the rabbit hole along with Michonne, make you question whether the actions you take are affecting the world and the people around her, or remain a vivid personification of her war against insanity.\n\nFull Review // http://www.honestgamers.com/12968/pc/the-walking-dead-michonne-episode-3-what-we-deserve/review.html","May 29","false","5.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

None of your decisions feels like it has any impact in the overall direction of the game. The whole game feels more like a fan made version of telltales WD games rather than a well thought out game. I had no emotional response in the decsions I took and neither did I care for the characters in the game. The reason why this is happens is because the game never has an introduction to get you into the universe, get to know the characters and from there gradually get to know them better. I would not recommend this game to anyone in the current price tag or rather at all. If this would have been around 5 dollars/euros it would have been more acceptable. Some animation is real bad and The whole game just feels rushed.\nAs for my conclusion think back on when you had the decision to either kill or save Ben in the first WD title, even though he was a little piece of ♥♥♥♥, you still understood where he came from and why he acted the way he did which made your decision not only harder but more powerful for yourself. There were never even a slightly simular decision in this game and we are talking about Ben here which no one really cared about. So would I recommend this game to a person with a pulse?

Not feeling right about living happily ever after when she couldn't protect those who she loved at the start of the outbreak she sheds all that is making her happy and leaves the comforts of Rick and his group. The next time we see Michonne in the comics is when she returns on a boat after a voyage with some new friends and this story shows what happened during her trip and why she than feels returning to the group and happy life is something that she can do.\n\nPros\n-Yet another great plot from TellTales and it even fits fairly well with the story that the comics told\n-Zombies and one of the most beloved Walking Dead characters\n-Simple controls make it easy for anyone to pick up and play\n\nCons\n-Short, each episode can be beat in an hour or two\n-The ending could have been better and I think that it may have been better if it showed the moment she left the group in the comics and ended with showing her return to the group as seen in the comics. This could have provided an oppertunity to include more montages and also made the game fit perfectly with the comic\n\nOverall\nIf you read The Walking Dead comics you'll probably love this as it fills in a blank of the comics, if you enjoy the show you'll likely enjoy this because it's basiclly an interactive cartoon, if you don't follow the franchise but enjoy decent stories you may like this, but if you're looking a button mashing styled fighting game you may not like this since it isn't overly interactive. Me personally, outside of the length of the game and the ending enjoyed it though.","May 7","true","4.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Walking Dead: Michonne has been in production for a little while and it's had me hyped for quite some time as well. Now that the game is finally out, I think the hype was definitely worth it.\n\nTWD:Michonne isn't in ANY WAY affiliated with Telltale's The Walking Dead Season 1 nor 2, so you don't have to own either seasons to understand anything, and although it helps if you've read the comics/watched the show, you aren't required to know A SINGLE BIT of TWD to understand the story and or plot in the game. There are characters who appear in the comics that are familiar to someone who has read them, but it doesn't make much of a difference if you have/haven't read the comics.\n\nThe game has also had such pretty visuals to accompany it. Although I cought A ♥♥♥♥ TON of reused models from TWD Season 1 and 2, lots of textures were polished on reused walkers, so although they were reused, they looked VERY nice. Models such as Jane's hunting knife and Arvo's revolver are seen throughout the game, but if you aren't a die hard fan of the game, you MOST LIKELY won't notice them (same with the walker models being reused). With these new and updated textures comes a beautifully created landscape and f ucking beautiful atmosphere. The aquatic area that is shown to us with Michonne, Oak, Siddiq, Peter, and the other crew members looks absolutely gorgeous, especially accompanied by the horizon in the distance.\n\nSince this is a short series and only consists of 3 episodes, I would HELLA recommend this game to any Walking Dead fans, Telltale fans, or just someone looking for a compelling story to play while they wait for something else *cough* Season 3 *cough*\n\nFor $15, you can't go wrong- the story is very memorable, the characters are very memorable, the atmosphere BLOWS me away with it's visual asthetics, the price is right, everything is just so in-line. If you're hesitant about getting this, I'd say go for it. Definitely worth the hype and the $15!","February 23","true","9.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

Ah, action scenes here we go)\n- balance between control over the character vs quick time events (imho far too many QTEs)\n- short*\n- poorly optimized\n\n\n*I recently played the park, which is even shorter, but the pacing in the park compared to this game was brilliant.\nBad pacing can ruin a good story. I felt like a producer of B-movies who has to watch between the better scenes by using fast forward to save time, before approving it. I somehow lost my emotional investement into the story during episode 2. And it took me 2 weeks to motivate myself to start episode 3 after release - i turned out that episode 3 was better than expected.\n\nSo, if you call yourself a die-hard TWD fan, I would still suggest waiting for a steam-sale before purchasing it.

I wish they had a setting under recommend as maybe or kinda.  I'd kind of recommend it if you just want the series but if not, don't waste your money.

Why the negative then? Well, it's only funny if you play the game the way it's not intended. People are complaining about choices doesn't matter, what about QTE doesn't matter? I decided to purposely ignore any QTE event thrown at me and only comply if it leads to game over screen. Guess what? About 30% of QTE doesn't mean anything - you could just ignore them and nothing happens. It was a lot of trial and error, so that's why it took me so much time to beat the game.\nIt looks like TTG take pride of their flaws and instead of fixing them, they force them in every game till they start looking like features. I hate having such polarized options when choosing how to speak to people. I could play the game in a inconsistent manner and it still wouldn't mind. For example (I wouldn't consider it as a spoiler in a TTG game): Some good character was beating a bad guy and I have option to stop her, so I did. My character said how important was to keep him unharmed. And then the very next option was to punch him in the face. Nobody  cared when I did. And again (later). What was the point of giving me either choice then? It's all black and white. And when it isn't, it's something about people you don't really care. Even Season 1 had such issue. But back then it was a flaw. Now it's a feature.\nThis is the last TTG game I'll ever buy. I might make one final exception for Season 3, but after that, I'm done with them. Unless they get their things together, there is no point to play same thing in different wrapping.

То есть - это более внятные 400 дней и ждать от него чего-то похожего на полноценный сезон не надо. Это такая небольшая зарисовочка часа на 4, а то и на 3. А это значит что второстепенные герои написаны довольно жирными мазками, а пушечное мясо (такое как Ник во втором сезоне) тут говорит от силы фразы по три.\n\nЭто фактически целиком и полностью шоу главной героини, и вот она удалась таки на славу, я бы даже сказал что играться ей поприятней, чем Клем во втором сезоне. Я люблю Клем как персонажа, но как ГГ она функционировала с переменным успехом. Мишон же на этом месте очень к месту, и харизма в ней присутствует, и простор для отыгрыша таки есть и за шинкованием зомбей и людей пачками она странно не смотрится.\n\nНе всегда в точку ее галлюцинации про детишек, правда. Иногда все прям как надо, иногда - чутка так cheesy. До днища галлюцинаций Рика из сериала оно даже в худших случаях не добирается - и на том спасибо. До "не будь дураком Рик, конечно же нет" из комикса-первоисточника дотянуться правда тоже не получилось, даже в лучших сценах.\n\nЧто у этой игры получается хорошо - так это улавливать и держать атмосферные моменты, вроде вот таких вот\n\nhttps://youtu.be/etuvPXr5xfM\n\nво втором сезоне это как-то слега потерялось, а тут есть, несмотря на крошечный хронометраж.\n\nВообще хотелось бы чтобы это был полноценный третий сезон, потенциала в нем достаточно, но видать не судьба.\n\nЯ в принципе доволен и тем что есть, но это я.\n\nВообще не факт что оно придется по вкусу вообще кому то еще )","May 10","true","6.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However since this is a miniseries and not really a full game that isn't suprising. So $15 for a 4 hour game, if it is a good game i think that is reasonble.\n\n-The Main story is based around Michonne leaving her main group at alexandra with rick etc. because she felt she didn't deserve to have a good live and feels guilty that she choose her work as a lawyer over her Kids.\n\nThe Negatives\n- Right off the bat i didn't really feel a reason to care about any of the characters, it wasen't until later in the game that i cared about 3 people, none of them being michonne.\n- Why didn't i care about Michonne? we know she can't die being this game follows a gap in the comics which she survives.\n- It was way too predictable. This was one of my main problems with this game, there was no big suprises , no deaths that really caught me offguard.\n- it just felt way too short. It's like telltale got ideas and thought they couldn't include anything intresting because it would be too much (to fit into a 4 hour miniseries) so it was simply a story about Revenge and guilt, it just felt like a weak story.\n\nIf your gonna say all this negative stuff about this game why do you still think i should buy it?\nThe Reason i have so much negative stuff to say is mainly because the first two walking dead games from telltale were basically 10/10 some of the best games i have ever played, which gives huge expectations and this game did not deliver. I still enjoyed this game thought, it was a telltale game, story, exploring, fight, cutscenes. It was good but i didn't feel like i was apart of the game, i felt like i was in the game in the other walking dead games.\n\nI think you should still buy this. $15 for 4 Hours of entertainment isn't bad and althought this isn't a 10/10 game a 7/10 game is still worth playing.\n\nSo to sum up.\nNot a Great game but it wasen't bad either.\nOther Walking dead games were 10/10 however TWD Michonne is probably about a 7/10 which failed to met my expectations of telltale after playing the other walking dead games.\nStory and deaths were predictable\nCharacters didn't really make you care about them.\nBuy it if you want but lower your expectations if you've played the other walking dead games, if you are looking for a game thats at the same level as the previous walking dead games you should probably just pass on this game.\n\n7/10 It was alright.

Michonne is fleshed out better with her past and I was able to actually feel caught up in the moment with John because of her past.  The episode had so much potential and it was just too short than I'd like it to be.\n\nShort: Episode was too short, choices improve, characters still give me no reason to care besides the two lead.  Episode was decent but too short.\n\nEpisode 1: 4.5/10\nEpisode 2: 7.5/10\n\nStill don't recommend for the fact I don't want Episode 3 to be a let down and I rather be able to fully recommend it when Ep3 comes out.","February 24","false","4.0"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","15","29","2","4"

The sound track is incredible and immersive.  The story...wow...the story.\n\nThis is BELIEVABLE and fits the character arc so well.  The confusing crossover of flashback and reality is something I might expect of a trauma victim.  Michonne is all of the badassery you wanted to play as with the all too human frailties that we rarely see in gaming.\n\nThis is becoming more of an interactive movie experience and I definitely approve.

Pete is who seems to be the crew's leader, he wants to find his friends. Instead, you come across a duo, and stumble onto something bigger.\n\nEpisode 2 carries on what you stumbled onto in episode 1.\n\nEpisode 3 gives you the big finale.\n\nOne thing I dislike about this game is the constant "halucination" that Michonne faces, as it interrupts the main narrative of the game with a side-narrative that isn't as important until the end-game choice.\n\nAnother thing is that Pete's "friends" that he was looking for, are not even in the game. And that's no spoiler, they just.. weren't mentioned. No dialogue about it post-episode 1, nothing.\n\nHell, the crew isn't even mentioned after episode 1 until the end of episode 2, and even then; you don't see them until episode 3.\n\nI feel like the game doesn't make the most out of the experience, gameplay and story along with character development simply because it's three episodes long. I was able to complete episode 1 in under 45 minutes, episode 2 and 3 I took my time on, however.\n\nMy playtime is based off of pausing, exploring, reading every piece of dialogue I could, and replaying episode 1 before episode 2 was released. So don't be fooled by the 3 episodes' length of playtime being long due to my hour count on this game.\n\nI would recommend this game if you are a Telltales fan, as the dialogue is interesting, a new story is fun, and the introductions to each episode are fantastic! I also love one of the 'main' characters, Sam, and for one reason or another; she reminds me of Clementine, so you might want the game if you're looking for a favorite character you'd catch onto after EP 1.\n\nIt's easy to run, has a few freezes every so often though, I've witnessed a couple FPS drops, I feel like TWD Season 1 was a better playthrough in terms of how well it ran on my computer.\n\nCPU: Intel i5 Core 4690k @ 3.5GHz.\nGPU: GTX 970.\n\nAs a Telltales TWD game fan, I will give this a thumbs up. But that's because I'm biased, though it is a shame as I would have expected more from this game.\n\nRating: 7.5/10.","April 30","true","8.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Do it. Do it NOW!\n\nSo here's the deal. There will be people around telling you this episode is way too short; that there's not enough time to connect to characters or to really feel the weigh of your choices. There will probably be some hardcore fans telling you that they didn't get some stuff 'right' from the comics or that there's just 'sooo many' references you can't understand. They are probably all right in their own way, but let's get down to the important stuff.\n\nWill you enjoy this game if you're not familiar with the comics and haven't ever played telltale's TWD's games? I'm not sure. If you're part of the group that played the games before though then I'll suspect that, just like me, you'll be fairly happy able to return to the universe of walkers, QTE events and choices you kind of don't really want to make.\nHowever, is this as good as that very first season that made you feel your heartbeat in your throat and shed a tear? Nope, probably not, but what it does achieve is reintroducing that much loved world to you in a way that you know what to expect, attempt to 'read' inbetween the lines and make an effort to give yourself the best experience.\n\nIf you're sitting there just waiting for S3 then The Walking Dead: Michonne is not a bad way to get that little, extra fix to remember why on earth you loved this game series in the first place. Can you survive without it? Well, that's up to you.

The story drags you in and doesn't let you go, like the walkers themselves. At many points I didn't know who to side with, but when I did the chacaters really attached to me.

Do it. Do it NOW!\n\nSo here's the deal. There will be people around telling you this episode is way too short; that there's not enough time to connect to characters or to really feel the weigh of your choices. There will probably be some hardcore fans telling you that they didn't get some stuff 'right' from the comics or that there's just 'sooo many' references you can't understand. They are probably all right in their own way, but let's get down to the important stuff.\n\nWill you enjoy this game if you're not familiar with the comics and haven't ever played telltale's TWD's games? I'm not sure. If you're part of the group that played the games before though then I'll suspect that, just like me, you'll be fairly happy able to return to the universe of walkers, QTE events and choices you kind of don't really want to make.\nHowever, is this as good as that very first season that made you feel your heartbeat in your throat and shed a tear? Nope, probably not, but what it does achieve is reintroducing that much loved world to you in a way that you know what to expect, attempt to 'read' inbetween the lines and make an effort to give yourself the best experience.\n\nIf you're sitting there just waiting for S3 then The Walking Dead: Michonne is not a bad way to get that little, extra fix to remember why on earth you loved this game series in the first place. Can you survive without it? Well, that's up to you. Just don't forget the bloody zip-ties!","February 23","true","5.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

Whilst it was still fun and the characters were cool, I didn't feel like any proper connections were made like you do in TWD. Also, the main premise is about Michonne losing her daughters and feeling guilt and we, as the player, are meant to feel that too... I didn't. I felt more of a connection to Sam's brothers who we speak to for about 5/10 minutes because you have a moment to bond, I guess? We don't get that with Michonne's daughters.\nStory aside, the gameplay brought up a few issues for me as well - the choices you make can't be made using the 1 2 3 4 keys which I liked, you have to do it with a mouse. Not a game changer, but it took me a moment to get used to. The QTEs seem a little strange too - I missed a couple and still survived like nothing had happened. To begin with I thought, well great, got away with it... but 5 or 6 more times down the line it felt like I didn't matter as a player and I had bought a film, not a game.\nI've complained a lot, but I still think this is a good game and I'm glad I bought it, but I don't think I can recommend it simply because it doesn't (in my opinion) hold up to many of the other Telltale game standards... I'd recommend just holding on until Season 3 is out.","May 1","false","4.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That is episode 1 in a nutshell.\n\nThe only truly likable character in the entire episode is Michonne herself, but mostly because you're already familiar with her, so it's no thanks to the game. Her buddy Pete is okay too, I guess. I mean, he's not exactly well-characterized, but at least he doesn't point a gun at you or lie to your face at any point. That's a rare quality in Michonne's world.\n\nAs for the rest... I just felt nothing. I know it's just the setup, but everything except for Michonne's inner struggles has been thoroughly unengaging. Here's the rough outline of some of the s**t you have to deal with over the course of the episode:\n\nRandall points a gun at me and asks me whether I know Samantha, whom I just met five minutes ago and had another stand-off with. I tell the truth. I just met her, I say. This prompts Samantha to exclaim "WHAT?!" with such incredulity, you'd think we had been best friends all our lives. Lovely.\n\nAfter being captured by Randall's people, Samantha tells me Randall is a mass murderer and an all-around scum. Lovely.\n\nLater, when I'm interrogated by Randall's sister Norma (who switches between "nice lady" and "ruthless leader" modes at will), Samantha's little brother Greg is called for cross-examination. He answers each question with a blatant lie. Lovely.\n\nThen Greg gets himself accidentally killed by one of Randall's henchmen. The little lying brat is dead. I feel nothing. Why would I feel anything? His shouty b***h of a sister is in tears. I just want to leave. Norma and Randall are somewhere out there, being all menacing and scenery-chewing and potentially mass-murdery. I don't care about any of them. Not even Pete.\n\nEven if episodes 2 and 3 shed light on this mess in spectacularly well-plotted manner, I still feel there should've been something more here. More hints, more explanations, more facts. Some reason to pick a side. I like grey morality, I'm a fan of grey morality. But this was just an endless parade of a**holes trying to outa**hole each other.

It's also quite short when compared to other episodes from Season 1 & 2. There's a couple of interesting moments, but overall it feels rather flat as a story.\n\nThe brief 'combat' sections feel like they've been speeded up somewhat. I don't think I died more than a couple of times in Seasons 1 & 2 yet here it was far more frequent, and I felt that the designers had reduced the time available for key presses to make it feel more 'intense'. Still, it's just a case of learning the correct key sequence for any combat, which is very easy.\n\nMuch more concerning for me were the technical issues I encountered, which has never happened before whilst playing a Telltale game. I could not get the game to stay in 3400x1440 resolution at all. Some of the loading screens would be correct, but as soon as I went into the game proper it would revert to a lower resolution. About 40 mins of my 2 hour playtime was spent trying to fix this issue, before I gave up. There's also a long delay whilst loading each chapter, which I've never experienced before, and this doesn't help with the flow of the game at all.\n\nThe overall impression is that of a rushed game to hit a deadline. Even the icons for the Steam achievements are just numbers - Telltale haven't bothered with the small pictoral representations of each chapter from the previous games.\n","March 6","false","2.1"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

I am a big fan of RPGs and the other walking dead games which were great but their choices all lead to pretty much the same dialouge or things transpring. In TWD: Michonne, choices seem to matter more for short term stuff than they did in previous games; not a lot of stuff in the first game mattered for example because whether u gave someone a gun to kill themself or say no they still wind up killing themself with your gun.. which is pointless to even provide a choices for things like that..riiight?! imo it is\n\nOverall I am very impressed, too bad its a miniseries!! To me the game has a better feel than their previous games; the plot, combat and the dialouge options are more immersive and fluid. It is also epic having Michonne at the center of everything! I'd find myself often having no worries for the player character just because its Michonne lol. At first while first starting the game I was skeptical, but once I got fighting zombies as Michonne the game quickly became a 10/10; your gonna have eye candy stuffed down your throat..its amazing\n\nThis is the first Walking Dead game I wanted to play through a second time pretty much right after my first save. From the visuals to the voice acting really everything was top notch, this miniseries def has replay value! In my first playthrough, Michonne barely spoke a word to anyone because I wasn't used to clicking the dialouge options lol. I was used to hitting #s 1-4 to select dialouge like in past games. Gave me some incentive to replay so I could go back and intentionally be a Scumbag to people lol!\n\nKINDA SPOILER ALERT:\n\nOnce inawhile this game turns into like a bad trip from Far Cry 3 through flashbacks; it scared me once or twice and just bc of those scenes I hesitated to play through a second time it was so surreal and creepy!!","March 31","true","10.3"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zweistein_Jimmy/recommended/429570/","zweistein_Jimmy","monster elf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zweistein_Jimmy/","226 products in account","It's a nice classic TellTale game.\n\nThe game is 3 episodes so from the very start I have myself prepared for something VERY short.\nGraphics wise it's the same thing we've seen with TellTales' TWD games (Telltale Tool graphics engine, same as The Wolf Among Us and others).\nVoice acting is perfect, as to be expected from a TellTale game. Samira Wiley acting as Michonne and not Danai Gurira herself makes very little difference once you have gotten inside the game's character. However wether this game will deliver us a great and complete experience is yet to be seen.\nSo it is hard to say this is a review, this is how episodic games are, it's like reviewing a TV show, not knowing how the whole thing is going to be.\n\nEpisode 1:\n\nWe get to have a great entrance with some insight into Michonne's recent past in comparison to the time we see her for the first time in the TV show/comics (however this seems to what may be mainly based on the comics). There's great emphasis on her Mental state, her emotions and thoughts. The way the character is introduced is amazing.\nHowever we don't get to see any key points about her past with the only exception of some dream or "hallucination" sequences if you like.\nI really really REALLY hoped for a game that showed us how it all started. How this character was born. But this is not the case here. The creators prefered to choose to show us pieces of her past through the safer technique of those dreams. If the rest of the game is planned well however there will be no point in feeling any disappointed.\nGood start. Few interesting characters introduced.\nWell played so far.\n\n\nEpisode 2:\n\nThe story continues as we follow Michonne's steps to this adventure.\nIt is confirmed that the story follows the comics canon core and as I mentioned already, the developers follow the safe route of the flashbacks method in order to show glimpses of how it all started.\nHowever I must admit i'm being left with a bit lack of satisfaction while playing this.\nTellTale doesn't seem to care about you interacting with the environment at all.\nWe've seen how these games work so we know that if someone's life is saved by our choices they are bound to day anyway if the developers want to.\nAnd most importantly, If you show mercy to someone who is a ♥♥♥♥ hoping to get a better outcome of him, he will still be a ♥♥♥♥ afterwards. like ALWAYS. In every single TellTale walking dead.\nSo all in all, thing are pretty narrow technically.\nI do some choices to make myself feel good about them knowing that the result is going to be more or less the same.\nSo is there a reason for me to like this?\nWell yes, the story is still nice and it's like watching a short movie.\nBut is there a way to make things even better than this?\nWell yes again, because if you are going to give us the illusion of control over reality without actually having it you can do it in more interesting ways like many other adventure games do. Like for example give us reasons to "point and click" to more things. More environmental interactions. Find collective items. Hell even solving a puzzle every now and then adds to the fun.\nA story is nice when you watch it. But it's even better when you interact with it.\nSo far things show that TellTale loves to keep things average by giving us strong story, good direction and amazing voice acting but completely lacking any fun interaction ideas.\nOnward for Episode 3 and final verdict soon.\n\nEpisode 3:\n\nMoving on to the final chapter the developers decide to use all their hidden cards on the table, bringing the best of their abilities to create a brilliant climax and a perfectly set conclusion to our story.\nThe story is eventually NOT focused on Michonne's adventure and meeting good and people no. It's focused on the mental torture of a person that has to go through the darkest corners of his/her consensus in order to deal with the best while reality becomes the surrounding.\nForeground and background switch places in a mindblowing turn of events. You experience a piece of art being evolved just like a painting showing you exactly where your eyes should be directed but at the same time having a background hiding the meaning of the whole picture.\nThat's how direction is being done people. It's not only about directing the resources of making a story. It's about directing the eyes and attention of the viewer/gamer.\nExcellent work.\n\n\nFinal verdict:\n\nIt's a bit hard to decide to make an objective conclusion here. Because the first 2 episodes of this story seemed so too average and for a few moments too short or too boring, and then the third and final Episode takes your mind and blows all your feelings and thoughts up. The ending climax is satisfying and their staying true to the comics is really awesome.\nOn the other hand there are other elements I have to emphasize on.\nDo choices REALLY matter in games like this?\nGameplay wise - you will eventually have the ending the developers want you to anyway. But the illusion that you can control the plot slowly becomes less and less strong. Take for example the achievement system for the past 2 Walking Dead games from TellTale. There are no missable achievements at all. In fact, they are not even "achievements", they are just flags poping up letting you know that you finished a chapter. There's no feeling of achieving something special any more. Point & Click doesn't motivate you to explore place or try new things. You are just left following a story, and if you find yourself too bored during a chapter of the story, you have one less reason to let's say go through the drawers and items you find yourself in but go straight to the NPC you need to talk to in order to go on with the story. You see what I'm talking about?\n\nThe game is a 7/10. Would had been a 6 - a slightly above average title, short, not sure if worthy a 15 buck release price.\nBut the story driven content is strong and the final chapter shows that the developers gave everything they got for it.\nThe game lacks the extra motivation some people might need to do extra exploring or replay chapters to see different outcomes.\nWe know TellTale can do better. They have shown us the potential.\nI hope they bring us their best soon.\nWaiting for the next Episode of Clementine's story :)","March 14","true","5.3"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","7"

I suggest waiting for all three episodes to be released before buying it since you feel very underwhelmed after completing the first episode.\n\nThe game play like any other The Walking Dead game. You talk with people while investigating your area and doing a lot of quick time events, and at some point you will trigger an event and continue the storyline.\n\nYou play as Michonne, a pretty badass character who lost two very important people in her life. She is feeling guilty about losing them, and throughout the episode, she get flash backs from the event and hallucinations of them appearing. That's all the backstory you got, and I hope to learn more about the event. Compared to the other people you meet so far, she's the only one standing out. You don't have long conversations with anyone, there aren't many topics you can talk with anyone about. It's really not going in depth with anyone.\n\nIt was a good hour, it's what I expected, it's what I got.

It's soooooo good to be back in TWD world, with S1, S2 & 400 days all being super awesome in my book, I bought this game ASAP. When I learned it came out, I almost squealed to death.\n\nThe graphics, holy hell, they have improved. If you have played the earlier games, you know that TT uses that "comic book style" type of art, and it works most time and it looks nice. But in this one, it looks even better. It looks fantastic. Compare them to S1 and just.. wow. TT what an improvement. The game is pretty. I am happy.\n\nThe main character is a freaking BADASS, cutting heads of walkers, slow-mo action scenes! Pure awesomeness so far.\nThe soundtrack is fantastic, the intro and outro music is wonderful, I immediately searched those songs and got them because I loved them so much. I did the same with TTs other games.\n\nHowever, as there are pros, there are also cons. I know some of TT's games are kind of, "you have choices!" "ahh but you can only do this". And it shows, once again. Lack. Of. Choices. And where there are choices, they aren't *that* good. And when they seem good, something dumb happens a couple of minutes later. If you played this the way I did (by being harsh, but nice to kids) you will think, "wtf was the point". SO I am hoping that the next episodes will improve! And that these choices matter in the upcoming eps. Which I think they will.\n\nAnother "con" if you will, is the lack of character development. The main character? Quite a bit of detail with her, but the rest of the characters? Not a lot. Now without spoiling anything, I am seeing small similarities between S2 and this one. Though this could just be a hunch, so don't take my word for law.\n\nI will update this review when the next episode comes out. So far, it's looking good, just need some improvements.\nWould I recommend it? Yes, to all lovers of the series. Unless you disliked S2, then I would say to watch someone else play the game. IMO the price is well done for the content that we are getting. Like always, TTs games seem short, but the story is always fabulous.\n\n9/10\n*will update review when future eps come out*","February 24","true","1.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Thats too short, by time it's built up it ends.\nSure it's a mini-series and episode wise it's shorter, but if you're expecting 2 hours+ for each episode like the other 2 seasons, good luck.\nThe game has literally no replay value either as the choices are so limited. I played through the first episode and not much changed doing it the other way.\nIf you're really intrested in playing it, wait for a big discount.

Thanks for another ration of thrilling stuff about zombies, TellTale.\nThere are things in it i'd rather count among CONs - some details don't look realistic as always, especially that pair of partially dismembered Zs they were hiding behind. A bit too much options for unnecessary violence you well push to use again. And i don't feel like wanna praize that kind of game play this game provides. A normal FPS action would do better IMO.\nStill, overall i can't say i'm dissappointed or something. Just what i need after TWD2 while waiting for TWD3.\nRecommended to anyone into zombie games. Unless you're younger than you shoud be to be allowed to play this or can't tolerate those cons i mentioned. Though it's worth tolerating i think.\n\nНеплохая игра в плане того, что я ожидал после Ходячих Мертвецов 1 и 2. Стабильно благодарен TellTale за очередную порцию зомбятины.\nКое-что надо бы причислить к минусам - типа некоторых нереалистичных подробностей вроде той парочки частично усеченных зомбяр, за которыми они прятались. Снова многовато излишних возможностей для чрезмерного насилия к использованию которых разрабы изрядно подталкивают. И не вызывает восторга выбранный ими тип геймплэя. Нормальный шутер от 1го лица лично я воспринял бы лучше.\nНо в целом не могу сказать что разочарован. В принципе то что надо после ХМ 1 и 2 пока не вышла ХМ 3.\nВсем любителям зомби-тематики рекомендуется.

But, with season 3 of the mainstream games coming later this year, this is a good enough replacement until then. 7/10. Recommend, but only if you like the comics and Michonne.","March 29","true","3.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

That said, i understand why some people would be disappointed. The series gives very little variation in how you play. However, that character you play as has context already and the audience knows what happens to her because of the comics. This is the main turn off of the game, but it's not supposed to be an open ended game where michonne can do anything and nothing happens to her.\nThis game is not supposed to be like the other walking dead telltale games with lee and clementine. It's only purpose is to fill the gap as to what michonne has been doing. And it fufills this purpose. It's more characterization for michonne, but my only complaint is that i wish sam and her brothers could have followed her back to alexandria rather than just going to oceanside.\ni love this game, but then again I could just be called a walking dead fanboy and my opinion disregarded so whatever.

If you are comparing the price exactly with the old series, it's higher, but if you compare the price to going to see the latest hollywood superhero ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ - this is cheaper, longer and far more gripping.\n\nWe are drowning in the oversaturation of entertainment. Gotta carefully select which gets our attention. I'm glad this game (>game) is in my experience, satan knows there are plenty I would rather weren't.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/firepunchgaming/recommended/429570/","firepunchgaming","Fire Punch Gaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/firepunchgaming/","131 products in account","I'm writing this review for the first episode, and while I do recommend it, I expected more.\n\n\nYay, we get to play as one of the main characters from the comics... it's a good thing. Just not executed in a good way.\n\nMichonne is still a badass and it's nice to delve deeper into her story for people that have read the comics and for people who only have watched the show alike. As most of you know, there is more in the comics than in the TV show, not going into depth about it as the show does just fine as it is. One thing i really can't understand is something that has become a staple of this Telltale series.. they re-use and rehash the same zombie skins over and over and over. I'm quite confident the fine people and artists at Telltale are far more capable than they seem to be. Whether it be time constraints or the fact that they are taking on more series than they can hanlde.... I'm not sure. It's a minor gripe, but it was one of the first things i noticed. Playing the game and I see the same older zombie that we've all killed over and over in the first two Walking Dead games.. he's back, along with a few others like the lady who's bottom jaw is gone and has the tongue hanging out The others aren't as obvious as they seem to put them in the background and out of context. The story so far isn't bad, but it was short(the time in game that probably will show is from me pausing the game, taking a nap, and coming back to finish it. No, the story wasn't boring me, I'm a bit under the weather. This episode was short, and seems way shorter than other episodes in previous games. I pre-ordered the game so I did get it at the discounted price, but damn, throw us a bone here. Don't make the episodes shorter. I mean, we are paying for a product, we are investing in this and i think should get a bit more. So, maybe an hour at the most for this episode and being as it's only 3 episodes you may see quite a few request a refund.. I don't blame them for that. I'm not going to do that. I'll recommend this for what it is and not for what it could be. Take that however you would like.\n\n\n1st Episode Pros:\nThe graphics are still pretty good\nThe story so far is ok\nA few new zombies thrown in1st Episode Cons:\nThis episode is short\nIt pretty much consisted of one QTE after another.\nYou can't build up a care for the characters when you only have a few very short dialog interactions.\nZombies are still re-used. We haven't forgotten what they looked like in the previous games. First Episode Score: 4/10\nWhile i still will recommend this, I do it cautiously because the first short episode will leave you wanting way more... and not in that good way we had with Season 1 and Season 2. We shall see when the next two episodes come out if they make up for the lack of time and content in this episode.","February 23","true","5.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a short time from booting the game to curb stomping walkers into fires and quick-timing your way to gory decapitations. The action sequences are stylishly letterboxed, and even go into John Woo slow motion at times to highlight the deadly efficiency of the title character. This is Michonne after all; one of the most badass characters this side of a Segio Leone film, and the game admirably does her justice for the most part.\n\nAside from some flashbacks and hallucinations alluding to her past, you're thrust aboard a ship with little explanation or backstory, surrounded by characters you (as a player) don't really know. The game takes place during a certain time period in the comic books I'm not too familiar with, so the tie-ins/fan service were lost on me. But that's fine, as I was more than willing to just enjoy the journey the game wanted me to take. The story starts as a simple scavenging/rescue mission at a beached ferry, where you uncover some unsettling signs of nefarious ♥♥♥♥ going down. It's not long before you're predictably captured and taken to a Walking Dead signature settlement lead by a larger-than-life personality. And, rather predictably again, you're singled out and taken to have a face-to-face confrontation with said leader in a dialogue driven “boss battle”.\n\nYeah, Michonne can be structurally formulaic at times. If you're completely burnt out on the Telltale style of games this probably isn't the one to get you back on board. The same can be said about the graphics, as well: yep, it's still the same engine, and it can still get janky at times. Gripes aside, I think it still works incredibly well for this comic book style presentation. When it works it can look stunning, and when it breaks it's usually pretty minor. There's certainly more creativity and style here than the previous Walking Dead seasons, with some unconventional camera angles and an opening with some Wolf Among Us inspirations.\n\nPlaying as an emotionally unstable character leads to some noteworthy moments. I played Machonne as a strong, silent type... because she's Machonne and that seemed like the thing to do. As the brief, pre-outbreak flashbacks allude to her familial downfall without bogging the game down in exposition that can gleamed elsewhere, you're also treated to a few mental breakdowns and moments of emotional emptiness that are quite effective. When Machonne says, “I've got nothing to lose” you know it's true and it makes her that much more dangerous and badass. When you're tasked with giving a ♥♥♥♥ about some of the supporting cast, however, the writing doesn't fare as well. The swelling music and story beats might be telling you to care about a heavy, dramatic moment involving some characters you just met a few minutes ago... but you won't. Same for the cartoon villains who may or may not be what the script and acting is strongly hinting towards... but it's quite heavy handed regardless.\n\n“In Too Deep” is a great first chapter to what hopefully turns out to be a memorable game.

So if you are a walking dead fan please buy this and tell telltale that their gamble paid off.\n9.5/10","February 23","true","9.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I would direct those people to the last word in the title, "miniseries". Honestly, based on all the complaints, I had expected a lot less than what I got, and I'm pleased to say I enjoyed my experience. You play the game as Michonne, the popular character from the comics, the television show, and now the game world as well. The game takes place, from what I gather, during a break in the comics where Michonne has a brief disappearence. This game intends to fill in that gap with the backstory presented.\n\nLike many who have played and enjoyed the titles in the Walking Dead universe, I was just happy to have something to fill the void before Season 3 releases. That being said, I think I would have appreciated this at ANY length, so I'm a bit biased. I've only played through once, and took my time in doing so, so use my playtime as a reference for how long it is.\n\nNow a breakdown.\n\nSTORY:\nThe story has the pacing of a series trying to get back on its feet, and while that sounds discomforting, it finds footing very quickly. There are quite a few more QTEs (Quick-time events) this time around, and if you're no stranger to telltale games, this will not be surprising to you. Fortunately, these are only for action sequences, and the story is still very much driven by your dialogue options. To that effect, the game does a very good job of presenting a good number of choices for each particular perspective.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nI found this game to be more heavy on overall action in a single episode than most of the Walking Dead games have had for the entire season. That's a tad hyperbolic, but play the first five minutes, and you'll see what I mean. Michonne is supposed to be a blade-weilding badass, and her portrayal in this game is happily accurate to that point.\n\nSOUND:\nAs ALWAYS, the music for each portion of the game is completely appropriate, and does what a good score should, which is enhance the already pulse-pounding dramatic moments in the game with music to equate. From the title screen, to the credit song, the music will never fail to disappoint. As for the dialogue, and sound effects, they are as pristine as I've come to expect from Telltale games. The voice acting features an incredible cast, with each one adding emotion into the scene and keeping the game as gripping as it is.\n\nAgain, I'm fairly biased (I mean, I still think the Walking Dead S1 game was the 'Adventure' game I've ever played), but I still think this is an incredible addition to an already sterling series.","February 23","true","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The story is different to the previous seasons with Michonne being more of a "badass" kind of character, truobled by her past and mistakes she has an extremlly powerful pressence.\nIf you are a harcore fan of the previous season I don't think you'll be disappointed;\n- Amazing and compeling story\n- Beautiful art style (the classic Telltale graphics) and great transitions throughout the story\n- Good characters which make the game\nHowever saying this, there are some negatives to this game which I hope they'll improve upon in future episodes\n1) The options are sometimes limited, when being interregated all you can do is ♥♥♥♥ them off and the diagloge options forced you to be hostile to move the story in the way they want you to go. Then again this a common problem with having games like this and in the end its still not a bad way to go.\n2) The way the dealt with Michonne's past I felt was a bit blunt and wasn't as hard hitting as simiar stories have been in Season 1 and 2 of The Walking Dead\n","February 25","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

When I first saw that this mini series was coming out I was slightly disapointed it wasnt the full blown season 3 however after playing the first episode it is a nice addition to the Walking Dead game series. The story is different to the previous seasons with Michonne being more of a "badass" kind of character, truobled by her past and mistakes she has an extremlly powerful pressence.\nIf you are a harcore fan of the previous season I don't think you'll be disappointed;\n- Amazing and compeling story\n- Beautiful art style (the classic Telltale graphics) and great transitions throughout the story\n- Good characters which make the game\nHowever saying this, there are some negatives to this game which I hope they'll improve upon in future episodes\n1) The options are sometimes limited, when being interregated all you can do is ♥♥♥♥ them off and the diagloge options forced you to be hostile to move the story in the way they want you to go. Then again this a common problem with having games like this and in the end its still not a bad way to go.\n2) The way the dealt with Michonne's past I felt was a bit blunt and wasn't as hard hitting as simiar stories have been in Season 1 and 2 of The Walking Dead\n","February 25","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is a good buy to me, so ignore the other cry babies, and support the companies if you love it, but do make the companies hear what you think and take point.","February 25","true","5.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The intergration of music into the intro is suberp and the ending along with the credit song makes you wanna play the next episode instantly. If you are a Walking Dead fan, well this is a must buy.

Although it seems the Game and the TV show are kind of different from what I learned. (The game being based of the Comic)\nThere were some new aesthetics in this game than the previous walking dead games. Although its been about a year or 2 since TWD Season 2 was released.\nI kind of like the new layout to be honest. I wouldn't mind having Season 3 use a similar look. Although I did experience a bit of a framerate issue, it didn't take away to much from the enjoyment of the game. I don't know if the lower framerate was from my computer being the computer it is, or if it was some graphical stuff from the game.

I hope the next 2 episode are longer with some challenge's as the first had nothing difficult. Why is it good? The story is interesting, they tell it well. The characters do give the game its own personality with a different identity to the other two walking dead games. While managing to give it the same feel and atmosfear, although I don't really care about anyone it apart from michonne yet (because of tv. show i never read the comic thought she had a son not two daughter but it's based on comic so ok..... ). The art again by TT is beautiful and well imo this game doesn't linger on anything for too long.Although they have not used the same actor\actorsthe actor\actors they have used have done a very good job and for me that's a positive, as for character progression?  I will reserve judgment for now as their aint been much yet (can't say why i feel this without spoiler) i will finish my review with a massive negative for the first episode but with a lot of hope on the next 2! I have no desire to play this episode again, but i do recommend it for now! It is a good intro that leaves the entire game hanging on the next 2 episode.

A little context: I played and really enjoyed TWD1 & TWAU (all on console). I have not seen the tv show or read the comics and TWD2 was my least favorite game. Now onto the review:\n\nEpisode 1 PROS:\nThe first Episode was really good story-wise. Its about as long as is typical for a TellTale game. If you've enjoyed the previous games, you will most likely enjoy this as well. The controls feel the same (I played with a 360 controller) but this time around they have added a series of buttons that need to be pressed quickly to proceed instead of just the usual one button QTE. Because of this new change, I actually died serveral times but never to the point of getting angry about it.\n\nThe tension is still there and Michonne is a really cool character. She seems so hardened by life but there are brief moments where she is a bit less so. I have no context for her outside of this game but I'm really liking her so far.\n\nEpisode 1 CONS:\nThe game ran slightly less than perfect for me but I am running this on my laptop (my desktop is out of commission for the moment) so it could just be that. I have a Win7 i3 with 8gb Ram and the intel integrated graphics. Its not great for gaming by any means but I've played FF6,7, Shovel Knight, Bastion, and Flame in the Flood on this laptop without a hitch. So what issues did I have exactly? I had occasional framerate problems where it would stutter and voices did not match the lips. Nothing game breaking but it did pull me out of the game whenever it happend which was occassionally or less.\n\nVerdict:\nI would recommend Episode 1 but ideally on a better system than my laptop, perferably one with a dedicated graphics card.","February 24","true","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I completed the first episode about 5 minutes ago, and was overall pretty impressed with the game. It isn't as emotion-filled, story heavy, or decisive as the "canon," (Season 1, 2) games, but is unique, and good in it's own way. The game starts off promising, and then declines for a little while. There is *SEMI SPOILER* a flashback in the beginning of the game, that has some QTEs and is very, "cool," to say the least. */SEMI SPOILER* After this, the game seems a little boring as it's mostly just dialogue. However, once you essentially leave the area you were just in, it is easy to see the potential in this mini-series. First of all, this game is littered with QTEs, which is not a bad thing because they are fun, use the same couple buttons (Q, E, WASD) and give you enough time to react. This connects into this games next unique feature; it's violence. You kill quite alot of zombies within the first few minutes to say the least, and while it dies down a little after that, the killing is still present. Right now, I don't want to spoil anything else, so I'll end this review in the next few sentences, but alot of other things are present in this game, that aren't in the other TWD games, but if I were to mention them, it'd ruin the fun. Anyways, the last thing for now that I adore in this game, is that just like in the comics and show, Michonne is a very independent, quiet, and brave character. In the previous games, you were usually narrowed down dialogue-wise with a nice option, neutral option,or sarcastic/anry option. Michonne however is very open-minded, and says what she thinks. You can be more straight forward and honest, you can "distract" the person you're talking to, you can share your mind on what someone should do, and you can just be alot more straightforward. You don't have to be the nice guy Lee was, or the sweet yet sarcastic girl Clem was. You can actually choose how Michonne is, and you can help her getover her past, or struggle for a possible "solution." She can help other, or focus on herself, and that is pretty much the focus of this game, or episode at least. I do not know if it is worth $15 at the moment, but if that includes all 3 episodes, or I can get the other 2 for around $5, then it is definitley worth it. This game is really good, it's just not quite the same game as the other TWD games, or other Telltale games.\n\nProps to Telltale though- try to keep the episodes coming out pretty quick.\n\nAnd don't forget, this isn't an excuse to release season 3 later, so get to it.","February 25","true","7.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Can't wait for the next chapter, hope this game continues to ramp up my enthusiam for Season 3.\n\n\nUpdated for Episode 2: Incredibly short, clocked in at less than an hour even after crashing twice for unexplained reasons. Seems a lot more cinematic than previous telltale games, continuous actions go on auto pilot and don't require the constant imput that I've gotten used to and the camera moves in a manner very similar to traditional television. While I understand the cinemagraphic appeal of wide screen for action shots I would prefer if they just kept it fullscreen, hopefully this change with not make a reappearence. Story ends at a point that leaves very little material for the last episode, and with the more 'empty space' due to the game's style I would recommend waiting for it to go on sale unless the final episode is more fleshed than I am currently expecting.","February 24","true","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It isn't perfect, and isn't the best, but for those who love Telltale like I do, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. NOTE: I have beat it twice to experience both sides (Good/Evil/Alternate).\n\nPROS:\n-More Walking Dead: If you liked The Walking Dead, I guarantee you will like this game. It feels just like the others and is another thrill ride.\n-Michonne: They freaking nail Michonne. Telltale has done it again, delving deep into the beloved character and keeping her fresh and exciting.\n-The intro sequence: Just play it. It's fantastic.\n\nCONS:\n-Story: Now what In Too Deep really messed up on was it's antagonists. While retaining some originality, TWD: Michonne steps dangerously close to previous WD plotlines, and I know a lot of people were disappointed. In my opinion, I didn't think it was that bad, but it COULD get worse in future episodes.\n-Cloud Save: As of 2/24/16, cloud save is not functioning, and won't save progress once the game shuts down.\n\nFinal Score: 7/10 - Good\n\nAS OF EPISODE 2\n\nEpisode 2 comes back fierce in a fantastic penultimate episode. Improving upon In Too Deep's flaws, Give No Shelter is a great second part. NOTE: I have beat it twice to experience both sides (Good/Evil/Alternate)\n\nPROS:\n-Michonne: Michonne's character development is absolutely fantastic. Diving more into Michonne's past and her inner feelings is a thrill the entire way through.\n-Choice Diversity: The further in this game, the more different it gets. You can choose whether multiple people live or die, who comes with you, and all bear different dialogue and changes with them. Your choices legitimately feel yours.\n-Story: I was completely engaged the entire episode. Unlike the similarities E1 had with S2, this episode manages to hold its own gloriously.\n-Flashback Scene: More insight on Michonne's past and people she knew. It was great.\n(Also Cloud Save is fixed. Hooray.)\n\nCONS:\n-Length: This episode is only an hour long. Though I'd like to have more, I'm generally unfazed. You know what they say, quality over quantity.\n\nFinal Score: 9/10 - Amazing","February 24","true","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I feel terrible at playing Michonne since she seems so stoic to me I want to stay silent half the time, especially given the situations she finds herself in and that this is after her conflict with The Governor. Can't wait for the next chapter, hope this game continues to ramp up my enthusiam for Season 3.\n\n\nUpdated for Episode 2: Incredibly short, clocked in at less than an hour even after crashing twice for unexplained reasons. Seems a lot more cinematic than previous telltale games, continuous actions go on auto pilot and don't require the constant imput that I've gotten used to and the camera moves in a manner very similar to traditional television. While I understand the cinemagraphic appeal of wide screen for action shots I would prefer if they just kept it fullscreen, hopefully this change with not make a reappearence. Story ends at a point that leaves very little material for the last episode, and with the more 'empty space' due to the game's style I would recommend waiting for it to go on sale unless the final episode is more fleshed than I am currently expecting.","February 24","true","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm not even in the 3rd episode and I'll already know it'll be good. It's the type of game that makes you want to punch your screen because some ♥♥♥♥ wants children to die and because they left it off at a cliffhanger. Then you want to burst out in tears after you see the main character die, and get shot by a child. This game is full of feelings, and thats what's good about it, It's like your watching a movie. And a plus one if your a dark person, you can ♥♥♥♥ up peoples lives, and you get to stab zombies in the face.

But for the first time in my life, i didn't like their game!\n\n\nIn this game Michonne has plot-armor. She's in the television series and this game is set before that. This means that nothing too bad can happen to Michonne in this game since she has too be alive or well in the end. In the show she is also alone when she meets Rick and the others, which means that there is no real reason to care about all the characters Michonne interacts with in this game.\n\nWhen i played this game i had this in mind. No matter what choice i make i know that Michonne will turn out okay, she can't die, she can't get bitten and she can't get long term critical injuries. So when i was interacting with Randall and Norma i just picked the most badass choices since they basically cannot hurt her!\n\nAnd what's up with them trying to pull of emotional choices regarding characters that we barely know and already have a bad first impression of? I for example sided with Norma and Randall because i didn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about that boy thief and his sister.\n\nAnd i never really liked Michonne as a character in the first place! Sure she has a cool katana sword, but her personality is boring as ♥♥♥♥. And since she already has a personality in The Walking Dead show it makes it hard to make decisions without thinking: "What would Michonne do/say?". The fun thing about telltale games was that you were given completely new characters where you could shape the character into many different personalities.\n\nI cold probably write a book about this, but i guess i'll have to see if it get's better with the next episodes.\n","February 27","false","3.9"," 30 of 62 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","30","62","0","7"

I liked the first Telltale Games' TWD a lot. I liked also the second one pretty much (both played on PS3). 400 Days (PS3), on the other hand, I was very disappointed in with. This installment, however, falls in between 400 days and Season 2. It is not bad by any means, but I would not decribe it as good, either.\n\nWhen I saw this the first time, I was hyped. Michonne is the most badass character in TWD's history, so what could possibly go wrong? Well, something at least.\n\nIt's shallow. It's damn short. It freaking stutters even when played with high-end PC. And there's something I can't quite put my finger on. It's okay, It is not as 400 Days where you were left thinking "why on earth did I spend my money on this?", but it is not like the first TWD where you thought "damn I need to play more". It just is "okay, then".\n\nShould you buy it? If you're a fan who just needs to play all the games, like me, then yes.

It's also quite short when compared to other episodes from Season 1 & 2. There's a couple of interesting moments, but overall it feels rather flat as a story.\n\nThe brief 'combat' sections feel like they've been speeded up somewhat. I don't think I died more than a couple of times in Seasons 1 & 2 yet here it was far more frequent, and I felt that the designers had reduced the time available for key presses to make it feel more 'intense'. Still, it's just a case of learning the correct key sequence for any combat, which is very easy.\n\nMuch more concerning for me were the technical issues I encountered, which has never happened before whilst playing a Telltale game. I could not get the game to stay in 3400x1440 resolution at all. Some of the loading screens would be correct, but as soon as I went into the game proper it would revert to a lower resolution. About 40 mins of my 2 hour playtime was spent trying to fix this issue, before I gave up. There's also a long delay whilst loading each chapter, which I've never experienced before, and this doesn't help with the flow of the game at all.\n\nThe overall impression is that of a rushed game to hit a deadline. Even the icons for the Steam achievements are just numbers - Telltale haven't bothered with the small pictoral representations of each chapter from the previous games.","March 5","false","2.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

Given that this is the third The Walking Dead title under their belt it’s more egregious here than in other places. While their formula and business model are definitely working, it may be time to go and rework a bit of the foundations before they’re past the point where they’re just resting on their laurels. As a game, The Walking Dead Michonne is solid. Not terrible, not amazing, but solid. Decent. Serviceable. It does a competent job of building some interesting characters and delivering on a strong and I’d say compelling narrative, but falls short in terms of gameplay, simply because of how overused the formula is. A definite recommendation for Walking Dead fans hungry for more of the same, but maybe one of the surest signs in years that the time for Telltale Games to do something fresh is drawing close.\n\nFull Review here: http://pressa2join.com/reviews/the-walking-dead-michonne-episode-1-review","March 5","true","5.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Whilst still very familiar to anyone who has played a Telltale game before, this episode has done a great job improving the animations and overall visual quality of the game, which has been one of my main issues with previous games these developers have made.  Whilst the story is very familiar and isn't very long for a first episode, it has a few intense scenes and choices, and Michonne's character makes every minute of it really enjoyable.\nIf you're a fan of the Walking Dead or other Telltale games (their previous Walking Dead games in particular) you should really consider giving this one a try.","February 24","true","4.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's Michonne. This is more of a personal bias, but I just absolutely love Michonne as a character in the comics. And they did the character justice. I prefer keeping her silent through the game, as plenty of characters can take her silent gestures as a response. A+.\n2.) The QTE system is new and improved. While it's really only a minor change, the black bars added to the action sequences help the player prepare for a quick response rather than catching them off guard leading to a cheap death. This doesn't mean the QTEs have gotten easier, though. The direction and button prompts on the screen have definitely gotten more thematic.\n3.) The action sequences have only gotten more badass. Fitting, since the main character is Michonne, but in the past, TWD's action has been somewhat lame in my opinion. The opening sequence is a glorious use of hallucinations and flashbacks in action, and it actually even develops Michonne's character. Take notes, David Cage!\nCons:\n1.) Some of the new characters' voice acting is somewhat lackluster to say the least. For instance,  a character named Greg has the worst zombie voice acting I've heard in a video game. Talk about half-hearted moaning into a mic because you're getting paid minimum wage for such a huge job.  , and Sam appears to be doing her best Mark Wahlberg from The Happening impression. While Michonne's voice acting is EXACTLY how I envisioned, the other characters' voice acting is still not up to par with some of the supreme voice acting of the previous seasons.\n2.) The story is weak. Think of every trope you could find in a zombie story, and throw it in. Tyrannical leader with a false dichotomy of morals? Check! Poor, helpless stragglers? Checkerooni. Pointless undeveloped character death? Absolutely check that box. Disappointing for a game from Telltale, the new adventure game pioneers.\n3.) Lack of any character development, as previously stated. You learn nothing about any of the characters EXCEPT Michonne, which I guess is better but my motivations were solely based on Michonne and how it would be best for her to just get out of the situation and head home. And even the character development for Michonne is somewhat weak, given that the very first choice, while harrowing, is utterly meaningless.\nIn conclusion, I would recommend this to fans of the previous TWD games. However, if you're a new player, go back and play the first two seasons and 400 Days first. It's up to par by TTG's standards, but I had so much more in mind. I suppose we'll have to wait for that ultimate TWD quality until Season 3.\n6.5/10","February 24","true","24.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It did give me the same Telltale TWD vibe the first one game me with the graphics and actual game mechanics, but overall this game get's a 3/10 from me.\n\nIt felt completely linear, everything felt forced, restricted, and there was no connection between me and the characters except my anger towards Norma's group. I know this is labelled a 'mini series', but it feels even less than that. Maybe a miniseries would be almost HALF of what the first Walking Dead title Telltale made, but this was extremely short for the $15 they ask of you. It isn't even worth the $10, imo.\n\nMy choices felt like they didn't really matter, the dialogue was bland, the characters were shallow, Michonne's backstory (although I haven't even read the comics) feels like it wasn't delved into enough, etc. Telltale could have made something great with Michonne's story, and they didn't take that chance. I would have paid the full price of a full-lengthed, fleshed out, Michonne game with the same caliber of their first Walking Dead title. Next time I see a Telltale game, I HAVE to read the reviews, I HAVE to make sure it's a good game. I thought Telltale would be a title with the reputation of Bethesda and Square Enix, both companies that have games I love very much. I want to be excited and trust that Telltale will release QUALITY games, because I excpect nothing less from them.\n\nI'm not saying to not get this game at all, it was a good game (in it's own sense), but it isn't worth the price, and it isn't worth having your hopes up for it. Play it for what it is, without expectation, and it will be entertaining. It kept me entertained til the end (you will roll your eyes here and there).","April 27","false","3.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

While this game doesn't quite up to the standard observed in two of my all-time favorite games, the first two TWD seasons, I still had fun mowing down walkers and participating in more TWD style drama and it certainly beats the rather pointless '400 days' DLC for Season 1.\n\nOthers have pointed out that there is a lack of emotional connection to any of the characters which is a fair call. Unlike the often intense sense of attachment and sympathy we experienced with Lee and Clementine, the connection and character development surrounding Michonne is limited at best and it is hard to feel a great deal for her character unless you are a big fan of the TV series.\n\nIt has at least been entertaining filler while we eagerly await the much anticipated Season 3!\n\nWhere I gave both TWD Seasons 1 and 2 a ten out of ten rating (Yes, I enjoyed them both equally), I feel this mini-series is worthy of at least a seven. Waiting for a steam sale might make this game better value for money as it will be quite short (approx 4 hours of gameplay in total).\n\nEDIT: The soundtrack is awesome and fits the whole 'Michonne' mood & setting.","April 11","true","5.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scatteredlocal3/recommended/429570/","scatteredlocal3","YourLocalWyzard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scatteredlocal3/","21 products in account","WARNING; Possible spoilers. So far I can say that there is nothing not to like. Unless you keep one thing in mind. So if I'm going to complain about anything I'm going to get it out of the way, and say I'm not exactly stoked knowing this will be three episodes. As a reader of the comics, I just hope that is enough time to explore what happened with Michonne in her time away from Rick, and company.\n\nSo like the other Telltale: The Walking Dead games, the controls are simple to learn. You get an idea of where you need to be on that keyboard thang. It looks like we are having a new mechanic in a combo system which I can totally get behind. You get a satisfying feeling in your stomach when you take down a walker. With the way the controls are set up, its almost like you feel the impact. So in other words; You feel the game. When I get behind control mechanics like that, you're going to have me going for a long time. Thats something that sets replay value for me. The game still begs for you to be on your toes; now that goes for taking down walkers as well as making those big decisions.\n\nThe story seems fresh, with me second guessing who may appear to be our villains in this installment. I have to admit, the game had me gung-ho and ready go to take Randall and his people down the second we laid eye's on them. But then I thought to play it smart, and hear them out. Let's see what they have to say. After meeting Norma, I again tried to hear them out. But judging by the way they play, these don't seem like reasonable people. Things don't add up with them. Just as well as Sam. That's another quality I love about this game, and the past two seasons. These games are pretty clever about throwing around your emotions, and scrambling your brains thought process up. Its a game of tug of war with quick decisoin making that makes you think its what you really want, only to leave you wondering if you should have gone down that path. Eventually you get a change of heart with most things. I keep thinking about the first two seasons with Kenny. At first I took Kenny to be a wild-card. I thought he may be a liability. Then I didn't know how I felt about him. It was a mix of remorse, and resentment. In the end, I found Kenny to be one of the most selfless characters to explore in The Walking Dead universe. So if this keeps up, this will sure prove to be a rollercoaster of a ride.\n\nThe soundtrack is also nice. I enjoyed the awesome tunage of the intro, and outro credits.\n\nI also finished the episode in 1 hour and some change. So with the addition of the next two episodes, that should give us enough room to explore what went down with Michonne between those 13 issues when she went AWOL.\n\nAs a big fan of The Walking Dead franchise, I can say I am very happy with what I am seeing. I started watching the show since the beginning, I'm up-to-date with the comics, and have played Telltale's Seasons 1 & 2 and was blown away. With the addition of reading the novels that coincide with the Governors storyline and expand on Lilly Caul, The Walking Dead is argubaly my favorite franchise of all time with its fresh take on the zombie genre and its exploration of chracter development. This installment is sure to add on something fierce, and amazing to the franchise. Let's go episode 2!","February 28","true","3.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

At the time of writing, only Episode 1 has been released, so I will update the review with my opinions of Episode 2 and 3 as they come out.\n\nPLOT:\n\nEpisode 1\n\nMichonne has left the group, dealing with regret and loss. Just as her mind strays to the darkest thoughts, a man named Pete rescues her (not the Pete from Season 2, before you ask) and soon she's off on a boat. Unfortunately, when she investigates her nearby area, her and Pete meet some not so nice people...\n\nI tried to keep spoilers out of that, but that's pretty much all I can say without ruining it.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nJust like the Seasons, you'll be choosing dialog, pointing and clicking, with quite a few quick time events. I must also say that, like Season 2, you have to click the dialog option, and I really just long for Season 1's ability to select with the 1-4 number keys.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nMy ancient computer was a bit laggy, but I sacrificed the anti-aliasing and it was fine.\n\nREPLAYABLITY\n\nYou'll want to see how different choices play out.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThat is pretty much it for the moment. Now we wait for more. I haven't had to experience this part of Telltale before, seeing as I was late to Season 1 and 2 and The Wolf Among Us.\n\n......\n\nHow long do we wait between episodes?","March 13","true","11.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Season 1 2 and michonne are the best. There is nothing wrong with it at all and i lovce it so much. I juist watched the season 1 and 2 traileer with spolier alerts which goes for 5 mins. After watching this after not playing the game for a long time i just start getting to hyped and i get sad because that msuic always reminds me of lee and kenny and  all those characters. I feel for all of them. I have never felt a game that i am so attached to. Do not look at this review then look at my hours, honestly i have played this game for about 150 hours all up including what i played on my ipad. Best game for an ipad or iphone you could ever buy.

But rather than all new characters, we finally get to play as fan favourite from both the comics and the tv show, Michonne. As seen in the description of the game, this takes place between issues #126 and #139 of the comics, and tells Michonne's story when she was away from the group. With a great opening sequence, and fight scenes that really show Michonne's bad-assery and ninja skills, this first episode was exactly what I was looking for in a Michonne Telltale game. Both the graphics, and animations have of course improved from the earlier games, and while the voice acting in general is fairly mediocre, but with Samira Wiley from Orange Is the New Black playing Michonne, it levels out to what I would describe as pretty damn good. The side characters were okay, with them initially seeming inconvienient, and for a good three quarters of this episode, I only really cared about Michonne's safety. Whether this was intentional or not, I believe that starting this way really helped the episode progress. Anyways, finishing my giant rant, I would say that this Episode was very well done, although the voice acting could have been better, and I didn't much care for many of the characters.\n\nIn total, I give Episode 1 of Telltale's The Walking Dead : Michonne\n\n9/10\n\nI very much look forward to the upcoming episodes, and will be updating my review when they arrive.","February 24","true","8.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Played through after beating the first episode and did the opposite "choices" and had ZERO difference. Same story notifications come up as if to appear that there was a choice but there wasn't.

I do gripe the other releases cause they were laggy, buggy etc. This is pretty smooth compared to the others.\n\nAlso, 400 Days was DLC for the 2nd Season.

I had high hopes for the series back when it was first announced, but after playing the first episode, I was left severely disappointed. When the second episode rolled around in late March, my faith was restored. The episode was short, but had many great moments, plus a very intense ending with one of the tougher choices I've had to make in a TellTale game.\n\nUnfortunately, after playing through the finale in April, the series took a nosedive right down into mediocrity again. Episode 2 had a great setup for Episode 3, but the finale just does not live up to what Episode 2 made it out to be.\n\nAnd here is the main problem with TWD:Mihconne. The setup for a good story is there, but the narrative doesn't deliver. The first episode has a great sense of gray morality. Without saying too much, you are held captive by another group of survivors. These guys don't seem immedeately like bad people, you might even feel sympathy for them. You don't even know much about your "partners in crime" and whose side to take is really up to you.\n\nUntil episodes two and three come around and try to force you into hating the "villains" eventhough you might not want to.\n\nThere's also this underlying narrative with Michonne's daughters, whom keep appearing in front of Michonne as hallucinations. They were kind of novel and exciting in Episode 1 and 2, but it gets really overdone and obnoxious by the time you play Episode 3, and you just end up wishing it wasn't there at all. The series ends with the stupidest binary choice of all time, as evidenced by the endgame stats, which showed a 93%/7% split.\n\nAnd I haven't even mentioned the myriad of technical problems yet:\nChoppy animation, bad framerate, and long load times all drag down the experience even further. I don't understand why this happens, Seasons 1 and 2 ran like a charm on my system, as did other TellTale titles, so I'm forced to conclude, that TWD:Michonne is just really poorly optimized.\n\nAs a TellTale fan and The Walking Dead fan, I can't help but feel disappointed in this miniseries. Here's to hoping Season 3 will bring back what made TellTale's The Waling Dead great.","February 23","false","6.8"," 63 of 132 people (48%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","48","63","132","10","7"

The voice acting was impecable, and characters like Randall and Norma instantly became some of my favorites.\n\nMy only gripes would be it's relatively short length and slow pacing in the beginning. Other then that, this episode seemed to nail everything.\n\nThough I would recommend this to all gamers or watchers of The Walking Dead television series, it is an absolute must play for all comic book readers.\n\n9/10","February 27","true","7.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Michonne herself especially is an absolute badass\n++ The usual painful choices\n++ Very atmospheric level design and aesthetics\n++ Extremely cool music and opening credits sequences\n\n-- Extremely short; in total the three episodes provide only 4-5 hours of play.\n-- As usual the impact of the choices available seems limited, affecting mainly the dialogue and some of the acting in the scenes. Michonne's adventure could also have been a film.\n-- On occasion the dialogues and choices seem a little construed. You rarely have the option of simply being level headed and telling the whole truth; the game forcibly pushes you into grey areas.\n\nNevertheless, this game gets a recommendation from me overall. I do wish it was a five part series for the price though. This is not merely a quibble about value for money, but rather a lament that you do not really feel the journey in this one. It's between the DLC and the full seasons of TWD and the emotional involvement is not similar to either format really.","February 28","true","4.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Yes the game is relatively short, where as in the other games at some point you will be walking around one area and speaking with your group, in this one, you dont. There's no talking/interacting to be done apart from the in-action scenes. (which is basically a lot of the time...literally)\n\nWithout any spoilers, i would say the game does lack emotional feelings in the sense you don't feel any connection to any of the other characters, I liked pete (not so much a spoiler, really...) I felt somewhat like i had to care about him. But that's about as far as the cares stretched, the first part of the game for instance, well...talk about throwing someone under a bus, honesty is hard to prove, if you know what i mean. But still, without comparing it to the other titles I did enjoy this for what it is, it does however feel like a filler though.\n\nAction scenes are more or less every 2 seconds, lots of Q's and E's, lots of pressing the movement keys and derping. It's more like a quick time event game rather than the usual choice game. By that i mean, there's few dialogue options and a crap ton of "press Q!" and if you don't do it in time...well, retry?\n\nThat being said, it's not a bad game, what have I learned from this experience so far?\n\n1, Don't dance with anyone in an end of the world scenario and if you do, never stop dancing.\n2, Peaches are great!\n3, Chopping up zombies like infected sushi is fun!\n4, Ghosts are scary even when you're at risk of having your face bitten off!\n5, You see that person right there? Nope, they're dead, no really...give it a few seconds...\n6,  I'm 99% sure Michonne is connected with Umbrella...Seriously, this woman and Alice, nuff said.","April 3","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a story that tells us about Michonne's values before and after the outbreak and how those values shape her decisions. It's a story about how her values shape how the interacts with people she hardly knows and those she loves.\n\nThe story they wrote here doesn't have much wiggle room because it's about a character that's been pre-established, and the message they are trying to get across to every one of us no matter what decisions you make.\n\nIf you go into the game looking to learn more about Michonne rather than hear a new story and meet and fall in love with a bunch of new characters then you will enjoy this game. Vice versa and you will be unhappy. This game has a very specific audience and caters to them very well. Unfortunately everyone else might get a bit lost and come out disappointed.\n\nAnyways, the finale wrapped things up nicely for Michonne's story and hit me in the feels. I gotchu Michonne.

Some things could be a little bias.\n\nPros:\nArtwork- As to be as expected the game looks really good. I enjoyed the art and design aside from the few texture glitches here and there.\nMusic and Score- The game does have some nice music that fits the game well.\nCombat and Action- Now the Walking Dead games are known to not be focused on the action. Unlike the other Seasons this game does have some badass moments in action. The fighting system is more intensive and heart pounding then the other games.\nMichonne- Now I don't read the comics but i can tell that Michonne is represented well in this story. Good character to play as.\n\nCons:\nIt's hella short- I know this is a miniseries but come on! This game gives 4 hours of story! 4 hours! I mean i expect a little more from telltale.\nStory is meh- Honestly and i hate to stay this im not really impressed with the stories. I mean it does have some difficult choices here and there but really there is no love in the characters your with in the game. I liked some of them but i felt as though i didn't get to know any of them. There needs to be more conversations with the characters so you get to know them a little.\nTexture Glitches- Now this may be a minor problem but there is a lot of weird texture and movement glitches throughout the game. Breaks the immersion a bit i guess.\nTo expensive- If this game was only 5 bucks i would buy it. I mean you can get a better bang for ya buck buying something else.\n\nSummary:\nSo let me say it breaks my heart to have to give a walking dead game a bad review. I mean i preorderd this game right as it was on the store. This game doesn't give them same feels as the other 2 did. When a character dies in this game i feel barley any remorse in them because i barely even knew them.\n\nIn conclusion buy this game if you are a huge fan and just neeeeeeed to have more walking dead in your life. Otherwise i would recommend something else.\n\n;( maybe season 3 will be better\n\n\n\noh and wheres Wolf Among Us Season 2?","February 23","false","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No one knows but my personal guess is that most probably her 2 daughters and husband are already dead together with her friend Donna when she received the last call from her and the walkers most probably have eaten them alive and she feels guilty about what happen to them if not for her insisting on leaving the family for her career before all this went down. As sad as it is, perhaps most players find the story too short, too hard to understand and feels this game is suck more than the previous walking dead part 1 and 2 whereby you can see Lee in Part 1 including Clementine and Kenny whereby Part 2 Kenny, Clementine and Jane, I know alot are waiting what happen to Clementine and Jane after Kenny was killed by Jane but hey I am waiting too guys and even Robert Kirkman says there's more to come and I am glad although this is a super short series of Michonne but at least we know how she survives.

It's pretty solid for a Walking Dead installment. It's entertaining and well acted. But the problem I have with this game is that it brings nothing new or emotional to the table. Nothing. It felt like Telltale was afraid to take risks and so they played it safe. The plot points were extremely predictable, the choices were easy to make, the choices had no impact whatsoever, and there were no emotionally strong scenes. I know it's just a miniseries, but come on Telltale. You can do so much better! Unless you're a huge Walking Dead fan, this probably isn't worth it.\n\nPROS:\n-Great music\n-Interesting locations\n-Well acted\n-Solid overall story\n\nCONS:\n-Although the story is good, the plot points are rediculously predictable\n-Many of the choices are pointless and do not matter at all.\n-Barley any emotion.

It's pretty solid for a Walking Dead installment. It's entertaining and well acted. But the problem I have with this game is that it brings nothing new or emotional to the table. Nothing. It felt like Telltale was afraid to take risks and so they played it safe. The plot points were extremely predictable, the choices were easy to make, the choices had no impact whatsoever, and there were no emotionally strong scenes. I know it's just a miniseries, but come on Telltale. You can do so much better! Unless you're a huge Walking Dead fan, this probably isn't worth it.\n\nPROS:\n-Great music\n-Interesting locations\n-Well acted\n-Solid overall story\n\nCONS:\n-Although the story is good, the plot points are rediculously predictable\n-Many of the choices are pointless and do not matter at all.\n-Barley any emotion.

I'm a huge fan of Telltale generally, and think Season 1 of The Walking Dead is one of the best games of the last decade. This is definitely one of Telltale Games' weaker offerings. Significantly weaker than either Season 1 or Season 2 of The Walking Dead, although also much better than the underwhelming "400 Days" DLC. I find it unlikely that I will replay any part of this one, unlike Season 1 of The Walking Dead which I've replayed several times. For $10, at most 4 hours of gameplay (each episode is almost exactly 1 hour, with the first one maybe running 75 minutes) is on the high end of what I usually like to pay for a video game, especially considering one of the reasons this mini-series didn't do it for me is because the characters are so weak. The main villain (Norma is almost OK) are so unambiguously and obnoxiously evil that there's really no moral dilemma in your dealings with him. There was no moment of reflection in this season.\n\nSo, on the whole, this is a pretty weak offering from Telltale Games. That being said, even a mediocre offering from Telltale Games is still a bit better than a lot of other games out there. As mediocre as these episodes were, they still were much more compelling than the actively bad writing of the "Mad Max" game, and there's also something to be said for not just presenting a sandbox without characters or attempt at representation. So Telltale here gets a pass from me, although there are definitely other games from this developer that you should check out before this rather bland offering.\n\nFinal Rating: 3/5 Katanas\n\nHere's when you should buy this:\nYou've beaten Season 1\nYou've beaten Season 2\nYou've beaten Season 1 again\n*Now you buy The Walking Dead: Michonne*\nNow you buy 400 Days DLC, maybe.","May 3","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Episode one was lackluster, whereas episode two picked up the pace and was more enjoyable, but both still felt rather short. It actually feels like there were more consequences for the choices made in the 400 Days DLC than in Michonne as a stand alone mini-series.\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend it if you're a fan of Walking Dead and miss the style of gameplay, but I really wouldn't expect much, just a way to kill a couple of hours.

It was like spending an hour with a friend who really bums you out.\n\nI was also dissappointed that the finale had a lot of talking which gave no extra depth to the characters and was at the same time frustrating because you have (spoiler) limited time before Norma arrives and you have no plan, you don't teach that little kid how to use the gun you gave him and all you do until the inevitable is talk about anything other than the current situation. Then when Norma arrives and the rest of the story is random chaos with people needlessly dying...\n\nThe interface has become really flashy, although it leaves you hesitating sometimes to know what imput it wants.
