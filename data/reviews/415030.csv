If you're a fan of first-person shooters and dungeon crawlers, you might enjoy it. But the game does have a severe lack of content, and in the end, I wouldn't recommend it for most people.\n\nThe TL;DR:\nTake a look at the trailer. See all the cool pieces of gameplay it shows you?\nWell, they aren't pieces. That's the entire game.\n\nFirst, the good. The game has three main components to equipment - your weapon, your staff, and your artifact. While the weapons are all pretty much the same in their operation (the biggest difference being about two in-game feet of range between dagger and spear), magic and artifacts can be more interesting.\nMost of your magic will work the same in the beginning- it will cast a fire-and-forget sphere that  costs a certain number of crystals split between fire, ice and acid, doing those kinds of damage respectively (in some cases, also physical damage). Later in the game, you will also find piercing magic, exploding magic, and beam magic, to name a few.\nArtifacts range from healing you when you drink poison to turning enemy corpses into more gemstones to a fairly luck-based healing item, and provide most of the game's variety.\nFinally, the inclusion of 'portal rooms' - that is, one of a set of challenges to provide the player with more equipment or artifacts - can help break up the monotony of the rest of the dungeon.\n\nThat word, monotony, can be used to sum up the game's bad points. The dungeons are all fairly similar to one another, since the five environments may as well be reskins for all of the variety of challenge they provide. One room will quickly blend into another, and you will find yourself using the in-game map to navigate more often than by actually remembering which room lead to which.\nSpeaking of navigating, it's something that takes a major chunck of your time in this game. While the dungeon splits into several pathways, the overarching structure is usually that of a pair of intertwining snakes or a starfish - very few 'arms' connect with one another, meaning that after you have followed a long series of rooms and passageways that all feel the same, you'll find that you have to turn around and wander right back through them again. If you like to clear out dungeons looking for loot, I estimate that roughly 1/4 of your playtime will be walking through empty passages that you've already cleared, watching the in-game map.\n\nThe enemies you face tend to follow one of two basic attack patterns - they will either charge straight toward you, or will  hold off at a medium distance and fire ranged attacks at you. In both cases, they are easy to defeat and have nearly the same AI between every enemy from level 1 to level 8, the final level of the game. The only differences will be their movement speed, their damage, and the number of blows to finish them. After an hour or two of playing, they no longer present any mental challenge and the process of 'fighting' them becomes a simple rinse-and-repeat of attack, move backwards, attack. Or, if you've got enough crystals to support magical combat, your attack pattern will be fire and fire again.\nThe damage types of magic make no difference to most of the enemies in the game. There is one dungeon guardian (AKA boss) who is slightly resistant to elemental damage, and one enemy type that is slightly resistant to physical damage, but otherwise damage is damage, be it fire, acid, or physical.\nFinally, the modifiers you can unlock to change up the game don't do their job very well. They can change the difficulty by adding health, lowering the health of enemies, reducing visual clarity, increasing the number of enemies or even limiting the player to one hit point, but they tend not to change the monotonous tone of the game or the mental processes used to play it. The one exception is a curse that constantly drains health from the player, which encourages players to race through the game as fast as possible.\n\nAs to music and visuals, they each belong to player preference. I normally prefer pixel graphics, but I felt it didn't click as well for this game as it does for many others. The soundtrack was also tiresome in my ears, but as tastes vary between gamers, I suspect this will not be the case for everyone.\n\nIn summary, the game plays more like a concept piece or techical demo than a finished product. The core gameplay is solid and doesn't have any real technical flaws, but there is very little of it and there's not enough variety to sustain most players over repeated runs.\nIf this seems contrary to what the positive reviews say, take a look at how long they've played. The game's real flaws only start to become apparent after a few hours.\nThat being said, it's cheap, it works and it's usually fair, so if you're a major fan of the first-person dungeon crawler, you might get your money's worth from it anyway. For anyone else, I'd recommend you keep searching.","December 1, 2015","false","4.7"," 134 of 167 people (80%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","80","134","167","9","3"

Knowledge of the different enemies will also come to help, as some of them you should be taking on with ranged weapons.\n\n- Conserve your staff crystals, save these for situations where you are outnumbered, or when you are facing enemies that cannot be kited with close combat safely.\n\n- The game really requires you to balance your resources, and as a roguelike it will vary quite a bit through sheer luck run to run, but that is often the nature of the beast with these types of games.\n\n- There are often secret doors you can activate at the end of seemingly dead-end tunnels, always check where it seems there could or should be one.\n\n- Most every level has a portal leading to an eldritch-themed area with a random challenge for some potentially good loot, some of them just give you some coins or other goodies with no challenge involved if you are lucky. When you leave these portals, that portal for the level locks for good, so make sure you are finished in there before returning.\n\n- Some levels have chests with rare treasure, but not every level has silver keys to use on these chests, as far as I can tell. It's frustrating if you reach your first chest without a key on that level, but hey, it's a hard game.\n\nI'll update this as I play further through the game, for me it was definitely worth the 5 dollars for the enjoyment I am getting out of it. Music is fairly basic, but serviceable I suppose. Art style is great, and the atmosphere and environmental sound effects are pretty good.\n\nThat's it for now, hope you found this useful.\n\n- Hamster Huey","November 24, 2015","true","5.3"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","26","29","0","0"

While it is a little light on the content it does exactly what the title implies: it makes sure you keep coming back for one more dungeon (and then another). Every time you get just a little bit further, every time you find a different item. It is all very enjoyable, and for just under 5 euro you just can't let this game go by.\n\nBut let me get a little bit more into the gameplay itself. One More Dungeon has a very charming aesthetic with pixel graphics in a 3D environment. Everytime you spawn the dungeon floor is randomly generated. The goal is to get to the end of the floor and descend to the next one. But in order to do that you need to slay a boss and get the seal.\n\nYou are armed with an iron dagger and a magical staff. While the staff is ranged and more powerful it uses colored crystals as a resource so it's uses are finite. That creates a nice tension that adds to the atmosphere. If you are chased down by snails and rats and run out of crystals it creates an exhilerating moment. Enemies also get harder as you get to later levels. Luckily there are a lot of things to find. For example, there are different potions, melee weapons like spears and axes and a variety of magical staffs. In a later level you can even find a magic staff that fires homing bug bombs.\n\nThere are more secrets to find (portals, shops) but it might be more fun to find out for yourself. For only 5 euro you could have many hours of fun in this game.

However, on the other hand, One More Dungeon would be worth recommending if:\n\nThere was more to gameplay strategy outside of +back against melee foes and alternate strafing and left click against ranged foes\n\nAll of the “cool” weapons shown in the gameplay footage weren't shoved into the end of the game or a really really lucky chest opening\n\nLevels were more open. I get that it’s supposed to be akin to a dungeon crawler but I’m not exactly asking for Lichdom Battlemage-tier empty expanses, just a bit more room for actual strategy and/or movement\n\nIt didn’t feel like I was burning money every time I used a wand; it was REALLY easy to get screwed because there were magic crystals for all of the wands except the one you’re actually using\n\nThere weren’t any enemies that seriously obstructed your vision. Vision obstruction in a first person game is actually the worst design choice imaginable if the game is going to be about fun\n\nAnd most importantly if:\nWhen I did eventually die, I actually felt like playing one more life. BoI and FTL always have me coming back for another round, but dying in OMD just made me question if I wanted to even keep it installed on my system.\nThe currently top-rated review is 100% right: OMD is monotonous. I don't feel too bad about sinking $5 into it and it's always great to see someone actually think about Linux when it comes to supported OSes, but even though Delver might be in Early Access Hell, they've still got a better formula going on than OMD. If you've got $5 to spend and want to give it a shot regardless of reviews, go nuts, but I'd say if you want to spend $5 just put it in your Steam Wallet or something.","March 23","false","5.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","9","13","4","0"

The game in its current state is very difficult to master, and it feels like slaughter at times. I'll follow this game and check on it every once in a while for improvements, but currently there are too many things that make this game far too difficult to play.\n\nReview 2: The developer cares about the community and his reviews, I am very pleased now that a different setting has been added.","November 27, 2015","true","0.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","2"

Games like  Axiom Verge, Undertale, and Downwell are prime examples of developers appealing to an audience that prefers a classic style and challenging gameplay rather than big budget set pieces, season passes, and online multiplayer.  One More Dungeon seeks to make its mark on the indie scene by creating a hybrid style that blends retro gameplay in a modern genre and the result is a short and sweet adventure that keeps you coming back for more.\n\nAt first glance One More Dungeon appears to be a quick and easy dungeon crawl that players can speed through with staff and sword in hand, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake.  In reality, OMD is classified as “rogue-like”a genre that rewards survival and earning as many rewards in one playthrough, before you die and begin again at level one.  With the threat of perma death always looming overhead, every time you progress feels very satisfying and keeps you interested to see what lies ahead.\n\nThe game begins by presenting  you with a list of perks that are all locked in the beginning but can be unlocked by slaying monsters and earning points, which are redeemable at the main menu after you die.  These perks range from super helpful, such as “Don't Hurt Me,” which allows you to begin the game with an extended maximum amount of health, and “Alchemist,” which provides you with extra healing potions at the start, to perks that greatly increase the challenge like  “Fog,” which significantly reduces the player's vision. Successfully completing a level with one of the more difficult perks active is extremely satisfying and kept me playing way longer than I had originally expected.\n\nOne More Dungeon's gameplay is a prime example of the easy to learn, difficult to master format.  Each level contains a level boss; a super powerful monster that contains the key which unlocks the door to the next level.  Players begin the game at level one with two weapons; a staff in the left hand and a melee weapon in the right.  The staff spawns with a random magical attribute of the ice,fire or poison variety. However, the different types of magic didn't appear to matter as each staff seemed to deal the same amount of damage. The real trick to each staff is the type of energy it uses, this energy takes the form of crystals (that are red, blue and green respectively) which the player is given a set amount of at the onset of the game and is able to collect more through his or her adventure. Depending on the type of staff equipped each blast consumes a set amount of crystals. Entry level staves only consume two crystals per shot, whereas specialized versions such as the wind staff consume one of each crystal per blast. Keeping an eye on the amount of crystals you have is key to survival in the later levels. When sorcery fails you will be forced to rely on your trusty steel. You begin the game with a simple iron dagger that deals a small amount of damage. More powerful weapons can be found within each level of varying range and damage. Finding an early weapon upgrade can easily make all the difference in later levels.\n\nWhile your equipment is key to your survival, the dungeon provides you with additional items and buffs to keep you in the fight. Special Shrines are scattered through out that provide you with permanent health boosts as well as fortifying your Wisdom, which is used to power secret relics found with special abilities such as the cursed doll, which causes enemies to explode upon their death. While these relics are very few and far between they can be extremely helpful in a tight spot. Additionally, many powerful weapons and items can be purchased at shops that randomly appear in each level.  These items are shown in glass display cases and must be purchased with rare “skull coins” that can be found among enemies or hidden in secret passages. While the game does give you quite a few tools to aid in your survival it remains very challenging. There were several occasions where I entered a new level with plenty of resources, only to have my ♥♥♥ handed to me halfway though. Each floor presents a new roster of enemies with more health and devastating projectile attacks that really force you to think before you engage in combat.\n\nOMD's style is definitely the icing on this indie cake as the graphics do a fantastic job of reminding you of classic first person shooters like DOOM (I'm looking at you character portrait) and the always pleasing 8-bit  aesthetics of Minecraft in the way the environment looks, as well as the way the attack animations behave. Each dungeon is randomly generated, meaning there's always a new room to explore each time you begin the game and there are plenty of secret levels and items that I won't spoil in this review. However, like many games OMD is not without it's flaws. The dungeons themselves often feel claustrophobic with a ceiling that seems too low and tight corners that make it difficult to move. Additionally, there are several pieces of the environment that seem like you should be able to interact with but serve no purpose other than to get in your way and in some instances obstruct treasure chests in such a way that you can open them but not get around them to obtain the item. Graphics aside, each level has it's own unique sound track, unfortunately these tracks are quite basic and also very short, causing the loop to become annoying on particularly long dungeon crawls. Technically speaking the game runs great. It's a small game and downloads quickly. The only issue I ran into during my time with it was when I went to ALT-TAB out of the game this caused the mouse to not stick within the game and would result in you clicking “out” and resulted in several deaths. The only way I found to resolve this issue was to go into the settings and toggle full screen off and then on again. All in all these seem like minor complaints, but with a game this small tiny issues add up quickly.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my time with One More Dungeon. It's a small game that presents a big challenge to those willing to explore to the deepest levels, and while it was frustrating at times it's classic charm, engaging combat, and constant surprises kept me coming back for more. Players looking for deep mechanics and an a story line may wish to give OMD a pass, but if it's a quick and easy game to play while killing time, or even a bit of adventure before bed your looking for, you  will feel right at home with.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jacmusl/recommended/415030/","jacmusl","Zip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jacmusl/","1424 products in account","Disclaimer: The review key for this product was provided by the developer free of charge.\nCheck out this review and others at Nouse Gaming: http://www.nouse.co.uk/muse/gaming/\n------------------------------------------------\nAs the game's name suggests it's both about dungeons and somewhat addictive. With a retro art style that looks like it's been lifted right out of the early 1980's (albeit touched up to a modern standard) One More Dungeon stands out as a rather excellent little dungeon crawler.\n\nIt's kind of like Legend of Grimrock crossed with The Binding of Isaac, a dungeon crawling rouge-like. And it's a rouge-like in one of its purest forms, every time you die you lose everything; no progress, no nothing. That's not entirely true but your score only allows you to buy modifiers which just change something about any particular run and generally makes the game harder. Like any good rouge -like it just drops your straight into the game. There's no tutorial and every item you come across you need to experiment with to understand what it does.\n\nIt is certainly not an easy game, even using the modifier that halves all enemy health I've still not even made it past the fifth level. You need to very quickly learn that running at enemies is a very bad way of staying alive and mastering 'kiting' is the key to victory. The combat is fairly simple, hit the enemy either with a bolt from your staff or a swing from your sword/axe/polearm and keep hitting until they fall down dead. Meanwhile moving out of the way when they try to hit you and avoiding anything they fling at you. Simple as it is however you're probably going to die, a lot.\n\nWhilst I've probably not managed to find even close to half the items and weapons in the game there certainly seems to be a fair amount of variety in it. Each weapon acts just a bit differently and limited magic crystals mean that you need to change up your strategy every now and then. There are also artefacts which have lots of differing effects (including one which I used and I'm pretty sure it just reduced my health to one for no reason) and rings which can help by reducing damage taken or increasing it when dealt.\n\nWhilst the music is somewhat unforgettable the sound design means that you know exactly what's going on, if you get surprised by an enemy it's your fault. My main issue with the game is that when I first started the fact that I wasn't able to look up and down. This twinned with a narrow Field of View I felt a bit motion sick. However it was a simple case of increasing the FoV in the options menu and getting used to the controls before it was no longer an issue.\n\nThis game has a lot going for it. Whilst it at first seems quite easy there's a tonne of depth and challenge. Wonderfully frustrating with the next floor always just out of reach you'll always want to do just one more dungeon!\n","December 6, 2015","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Quite a difficult one I would say, you not only need to care about what to choice for your melee weapon and you wand (let alone the kind of ammo about your wand), you also need much luck to beat the game.\n\nCoins are scarce in the game so try explore the whole map- even you may encounter more monsters but you won't survive the next level if you don't search carefully. And the key to open chest is the most precious thing in the game since some powerful wand can only be obtained by open chests (and they're free!) lol.\n\nIf this game allow people to save that would be a lot better. I started to get some trouble from level 4 and after that monsters are really tough, they have pretty high both in attack and life which makes it's hard to proceed, I need to attack once and retreat so the enemy will not hurt me.

I may update this review later.\\nThis game is good, and is a throwback to the days of msdos based fps games, but there is another game (which I will not name here out of respect for the devs) which is much more polished, immersive, and replayable than this one.\nI wouldn't say, that it's a bad game, but the fact that it's almost exactly like another game on the market with quite a bit less content kinda irks me a bit.\nAs for the gameplay itself, it's good and polished. The variety of enemies keeps you on your feet. The graphics are "doom/duke nukem-ish" which is the main reason that I bought it.\nIt's not a bad game, and if you enjoy the msdos graphics, then you will more than likely enjoy this game for a few hours. At $5, it's a good buy.\nI recommend, but will only give 7/10 until the devs add more content and immersion activities/elements\n\nSuggestions for the Devs More items  In my time of play, the only items that I encountered were staff crystals, weapon upgrades (new weapons), and artifacts. Giving the player more items and sidequests to collect those items would distract them from the repetitiveness that comes with any type of first person game.\nShop System?  I haven't managed to pass the first dungeon, so for all I know there could be a shop, but it would be nice to be able to buy/sell item along with actually seeing a portion of the items that the game has to offer.\nStory?  While I know this is a dungeon crawler with a limited story line, it would be nice to have some type of motivation for delving through infinite dungeons","November 23, 2015","true","1.3"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

But again, it's very close.\n\nThe game is shallow and repetitive with little variety, and the equipment that you start with is more frustrating than fun.  One you replace your starting equipment, the game gets a bit more fun, but only because it's less unfair at that point.  The items I've experienced do little to offer up a real change in gameplay, but again, you can't and typically don't expect much depth from a $5 game.\n\nSo at $5 it's worth a couple of hours of your time if you absolutely need to kill time and are bored.  You won't get huge value like you would from The Binding of Isaac, but honestly comparing anything that game is unfair, as it is an outlier in terms of dollars per hour played.\n\nI expand on this much more in my video:\nhttps://youtu.be/Z2DE-Va7eOs","December 8, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You will have find to find resources, killing enemies, avoiding traps and killing the "Big" enemy that holds the exit key on each floor. The game is first person camera view and it is pixelated. You have an inventory tool bar and a backpack However the toolbar is very limited and items will not stack on top of each other if you have more then one. There are 3 different magic staves in the game and with each of their own shots.  You also start with a sword and a map. You are able to find upgradeable items to boost your power. There are secret area's and objects. You can destroy objects to find some loot or even enemies. There is a score but who cares about that, The game gets rather difficult though and im not sure if the game has a high replayability.\n\nMusic is looping over and over and doesn't seem to have a huge variety into it. But the music isn't that bad.\nThe hitbox is almost or close to "perfect". Which means, Objects/enemies/shots hitboxes are on pinpoint. Which is really good.\n\nGames are saved on the start of each floor. So if ur gonnna quit the run or stop in a middle of a run. You will have to redo the entire floor over again and every progress on that floor is gone.\n\nWhenever you are using the artefact effect. Your mind energy will be dropped. If this is too low, you will take damage and random monsters will be able to spawn to attack you. Killing enemies will gain Mind energy. (Yellow heart).\n\nThere are mutators to make your game easier or more harder. You are able to buy and unlock them with "score" points.\nYou are not required to play with those mutators but there are some achievements however.\n\nOther things.\nObjects that can't be destroyed could block your way, which could be annoying sometimes.\nThe face has a Wolfenstein/Doom reference.\nYou are able to see on the map for "interacting" objects.\nThose "eyed" Portals COULD BE dangerous and could be interesting and worthy items inside.\n\n-------------------\n\nI Give this game a 7/10\n","April 8","true","3.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This game is charming with a great concept that big scale companies wouldn't even consider producing due to what the populace is generally entertained by. Few people would go digging through steam to look for a game such as this, and above all else it is an indie game, the differences between this and any mainstream game is insane. Interestingly enough One More Dungeon has a great deal of strategy to it as it progresses. You will run into new enemies with different mechanics that you need to learn and play around, as well as the gear you acquire changes how you can fight and explore/scavenge. The terrains and art being one of the things they really don't need to improve upon because it just simply the style they chose for this game, and they did not screw it up, in fact i love it. Now, despite my praise and love for this game it does have flaws. Within the short time of me playing this I did run into a glitch that many people have reported and seen throughout the community, some of the level doesn't load properly. This consists of some walls being passable (walk straight through them) or you cannot see part of the world in front of you. Another is that the A.I. are incredibly stupid and/or need more mechanics, they need to be tweaked, but hopefully they won't make all of them like one of the demon babies that teleports behind you after every attack it makes; that guy is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t hard and isn't even a boss. Bosses themselves need more mechanics to make them interesting for they just appear to be a glorified version of some other mobs that are introduced on the same level as them. Another quick note is that the daggers seam worldly inferior to all other weapons to the point that a steel dagger is worse than an iron sword, they simply need a buff or rework to give them any other use. One last complaint would be, would you please explain way the last level is happening the way it is. Without spoiling anything it really does just through you into a ridiculous scenario and explains your level objective, without a notion of logic. Other than that i see that they could simply have things like enemy patrols, maybe add some of the staff abilities to the bosses so they aren't meh, and you have a complete game. It is yet again a fairly knew game and I hope that the people will work to wrap this up and complete one of my most entertaining indie games that much better. I do however feel sorry for this company because they are literally being criticized by little kids that honestly don't appreciate anything about this, for example they will insult the graphics and it's "polishing" thus implying they don't know what pixel art is, nor do they care to respect it. Also multi player would be a stupid concept to add to this game for so many reasons that i won't even tackle it.\n\nThanks for reading my thoughts, and i hope you guys complete what little is left to be added to this game,\nLyle Lagi.\n\nSomething I also noticed 13/14 people who reveiwed this negatively played it for less than 2 hours and responded like unconstructive children with no valid input on the game. But for the one dude I saw play it for longer put enough thought and curticy to be honest and actual do decent comantary on the product.","January 7","true","11.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

It's fine until you run out of ammo for the staff, the sword is almost unusable because to hit them you need to get close. When you get close you get hit. Even if you are walking backwards to avoid getting hit you end up running into something and getting stuck and killed. If there was some way to block that would be a huge help.

It consists of walking in reverse to avoid the enemy swings and sneaking in your own jabs.  Difficult to do.  Differs just slightly depending on your weapon, but there's not much variety for melee weapons.\n\nRanged combat costs magic crystals for ammo.  You can find crystals around the dungeons, but even when using melee as your main combat, you'll run out.  Ranged enemies MUST be attacked from range or you're guaranteed damage.  On top of that, it doesn't seem to function right.  Usually, the first time I clicked, the staff would "swing" but there's no projectile.  After that I could shoot fine, but then the same thing would happen later unpredictably.\n\nEnemies aren't very audible.  It's not uncommon to suddenly be taking damage from some critter you didn't detect, and when you start with 8hp, that's a big deal, likely to kill you.\n\nOther than these problems, it's still pretty fun.  Run around a dungeon, trying to take no damage in the difficult combat, maybe if you're lucky, find some loot.  Beat the boss and go to the next level!  Repeat until you're dead, and then you probably won't want to play again.\n\nI also posted a few screenshots with descriptions.","May 7","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In addition, I would like to see this game introduce more features asked by the community like "Crafting" and perhaps in the future if ever "Multiplayer" even though as I previously stated that they would not perform this update for that feature it would still be a nice thing to add.\n\nSummary:\nIn summary, this game is very fun and enjoyable if you like Binding of Isaac and DOOM/Quake. It's kinda like a mix between both with the two games and it brings some things new to the table and leaves some out that I feel coul have given it a higher score. However they don't plan on Multiplayer as said in discussions the game on its own could be a fun party game where you can make your friends see how long they go without dying or going on specific runs with the modes you can choose before you start the game. As you load in the game for the first time you load into a room with most likely no enemies, you then escape the womb of the first room and experience the new rooms and doors that have crates and enemies of which you can loot & slay. Like in Binding of Isaac, there are chests, and these chests do require a key which is a rare item that comes from finding them in crates, enemies, or laying around in the dungeon (Which can be a confusing factor for new players.) Nonetheless it still makes the game challenging and fun for new players. What I found enjoyable was the portals which are in rooms that look really odd with a purpleish other planet life on the floor, like the grass is turned into eyeballs and things are twisted only in that room. Once you enter the portal you are most likely to A: Walk into enemies and find a rare item, B: Find a token room where you can spend your points on Ice, Fire, and Acid crystals, you also will find health point and sanity vendor, Or C: Where you do a small course or juke objects and collect your loot that way. Shops in this game exist where you can find tokens throughout the dungeons and use them on the shop ranging from 2 - 4+ tokens. No bugs to be found so far and it's remarkable for an indie game. I highly suggest you should buy this game and give it a try.","May 20","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
