It tries to bridge the gap between simulators and conventional video games, which it does with some success. There are few niche games like this, so it is good when one shows up, even if it is not perfect. It reminds me a bit of SimCopter from 1996.\n\nRealism and flight physics are very good but not perfect. There is a start-up procedure, but it is simplified. There is no autopilot but there is an optional auto-hover helper. The controls have the same kind of problems as in ARMA, and I had to spend a long time tweaking them. Unlike most sims, you control a human as you would in any shooter game, who in turn can board and pilot helicopters realistically.\n\nThere is a career mode that has interesting missions and a decent believable story. It takes 10-15 hours but I wish it was longer. There is also a small management aspect - you can buy new equipment, inspect your helicopter, and pay for maintenance to prevent breakdowns. While the voice acting is good, it does have a low-budget / mod feel with crude character animations etc. And as with ARMA, some missions were a bit difficult, and had unreliable scripting, forcing me to retry a few times. Overall, I still enjoyed it.\n\nThen there are the more challenging time trials, where you have to fly as fast as you can through virtual hoops placed between buildings and under bridges etc. The courses range from moderate to insane - these are awesome, but require you to have mastered the helicopter controls . They are probably the most intense and challenging races I have tried in any game, partly thanks to the additional vertical dimension - car racing games are so 2-dimensional by comparison (pun intended).\n\nContrary to what most say, the graphics look good and I get a decent 60 fps with only ocasional slowdowns to 40 fps (with an i5-4570 and overclocked GTX660). The Seattle environment is detailed and beautiful. I did have to carefully tweak the video settings though. My youtube video stutters a bit but that is just youtube, the game was smooth.\n\nSadly multiplayer does not work, due to the gamespy server shutdown. While you can just about play with a keyboard or controller, you really do need a '3-axis + thruster' joystick (about $30).\nDespite its flaws, I would strongly recommend this to mature patient gamers willing to try a flight sim.","November 14, 2014","true","41.0"," 85 of 96 people (89%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","89","85","96","14","1"

There is probably thousand of different models for buildings, not only for landmark, but any major building have it's own model and detailed texturing. Those also all collision enabled, meaning you can crash or land on. Even trees are crashable 3D models. You can even land and get out of your bird and start playing ARMAII in Seattle. Or in normal ARMAII maps - if you own it in Steam.\n\nI was so looking forward to start playing single player campaign, imagining limitless country of fun with all goodness above combining with full range of civil helicopter's activities, starting with simple taxi missions and ending with sling load operation and search-and-rescue mission using FLIR (thermal vision camera).\n\nTo my very disappointment there is - as we russians say - one spoon of ♥♥♥♥ in barrel of honey. And it's flying itself. I'm not IRL pilot so i can't explain things in the right worlds, but i own (and fly almost daily) DCS UH-1 and X-Plane 10 with some payware helos, so i guess i know that is right and that is wrong. And TKOH helicopters are behaves wrong. More of that - they all share same dynamics, just with different coefficients. For example all of them have same speed. It's not like i didn't notice that playing free flights, i just thought i could deal with slow response, overreacting titling and nonexistent transition on lightest bird in campaign.\n\nTurns out what with adding more power by coefficients thing only becomes worse, so heaviest copter not only overreacting inputs (but still slow) but tends to get lift with smallest lateral movement and suddenly drop it then you manage to get steady. Combined with oversaturated (remember - we have add power) tendency for forward movement (you need a several degrees of back pitch to hold it in place) makes most docile and presumable easy to hover craft unmanageable. So on second container in 7th mission of campaign i ragequit.\n\nSpeaking of campaign - in 7 (+2 sidemissions) missions i did, there was only two civilian missions. Three if you count whale seeing mission, but single engine helo without emergency water landing equipment not sounds like civilian job for me here. And there is more of such nonsense. Why two-engine helicopters goes down after one failed? Yeah we have two turbine for fancier look. Why we need rope insertion on flat roof in heavy wind, especially after i perfectly landed before mission marker even appears.\n\nConcluding, i wouldn't recommend this game to any flight sim enthusiast. Despite perfect envelopment flying itself is unbearably broken and won't be fixed because of 3rd party component BI have to rely here.","January 7, 2014","false","37.9"," 194 of 267 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","194","267","4","0"

I review and rate this game as it succeeded as a flight simulator to me, a flight simulator ethusianist.\n\nIf you haven't noticed already, this is Arma. The same engine, only with upgraded visuals, picture-in-3D picture availability, and a highly realistic flight model for helicopters. It also works like an Operation Arrowhead, that you can mount all Arma 2 DLCs into this, plus some ToH-specific expansions (yeah, you can play the normal Arma at this, with tanks, Chernarus, guns n stuff).\n\nThe main feature of this game, it's flight engine- it feels pretty damn realistic, even when compared to FSX or other simulators. I've spent some years on FSX and had no problems in X-Plane, but this game still needed some balls to master on the most realistic difficulty.\nDo not play this game without a joystick, you're gonna miss a lot or not even be able to fly at all. I don't know if it's even possible to handle the helicopters safely at the most realistic setting, without majorly using the auto-hover option, flying only by mouse or keyboard. Joystick settings provide all forms of options, such as rebinding some axis, deathzones or individual sensitivities. Controls use the classical, Arma style of options, which was already confusing enough at Arma 2 but copied all the controls over to here and added several more to that, to make it even harder to navigate.\n\nThe campaign is quite fun and challenging. Between each missions, you're able to dwell around on the helipad, check your helicopter for issues, upgrade or repaint it and also buy a different one (for an ammount of cash that takes some time to get. By upgrades I mean usually mission-only equipment, such as a camera or a hook, but you can also buy doors, seats or a rear mirror which might come useful sometimes. It's not much of pimp yo choppa, and could be a bit more extended. But rather than that, I would have more than just three god damn machines, it also has no unique rideable planes. The description is kinda misleading in here:\n\nWHAT IT SAYS: Three classes of helicopters\nWHAT IT MEANS: Three helicopters, each with many different liveries or custom one-color RGB painting\n\nCampaign is easy to screw up by selling a wrong helicopter and if you do so, you're bound to doing extremely tideous mission which self-repeats itself and takes even from 30 to 60 minutes (by adequately using the time acceleration), dozens of times. Asked other people several times but noone replied, because the community for this game (on both BIS forums and here) is probably dead.\n\nThe multiplayer is also dead. The server list is not working and ToH did not receive it's own server list hosting, like other Arma games did. The multiplayer mission making of this game has a high potential, but nobody apparently used it, as the community also doesn't care much about this thing (but you can still fly n fight around with friends if one can host). The new maps are HUGE, the Asia is like several kilometers across (expect a lower ground detail aswell, but it has one very large city full of accessible buildings, several times bigger than Chernogorsk), so flying in the asian map wouldn't feel "small" at all, even with a C-130, where amazing missions could be created.\n\nBut my goal is to rate this game for it's realism, not for how much armaish flaws or bad optimisation it has. And if you're a flight sim lover looking for challenges, I can't think of any harder helicopter flying experience. But if you expect a good combat experience as in Arma, lots of multiplayer action, detailed terrain and can't run Arma 2 decently with full settings and 3000 - 4000 visibility, you should rather leave this game where it is","August 9, 2014","true","25.2"," 32 of 33 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","32","33","0","4"

VBS3.0 or DCS UH-1H Huey gives budding pilots a much better benchmark for those who want to see how helicopter perform in real life.\n\n3) people who don't have joysticks/pedals/throttles/TRACK IR's- as soon as I jumped into the game, it just felt wrong trying to fly with a mouse and keyboard. Like with most sims nowadays, it's not so much the game, it's the hardware you use on the game. So consider trying the demo first with your current setup, and ugrade as neccessary if you feel the need to.\n\nHope this helped anyone.","December 14, 2013","false","2.6"," 96 of 138 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","96","138","0","1"

It's very good to play while trying to chill out.  Joystick highly recommended, as is a TrackIR or FreeTrack (or Oculus Rift hopefully one day), so that you can sit back and enjoy what helicopters do best: cruise.\n\nThe Armed Assault engine makes the helicopters fun to control without overly complex controls, and the skill envelope is just high enough to make it a fun game.  Bohemia Interactive surprised me with this one.\n\nThe campaign is fun, too.  Mechanic mode minigame that saves your company money, while immersing you in a small-business feeling.

The military sims are enjoyable, and definitely challenging, but seem to hurry past the learning to fly and focus more on combat.  There is a good mix of civilian, transport, and law enforcement/military missions which allow you to earn money and buy all the upgrades, there can be an issue if you sell a helicopter you need, so picking up extra missions is helpful.  I would do often walk around inspections of each heli before taking on a mission to significantly lower the repair bill.\n\nRealism:\nWithout a doubt, this is the most realistic feeling physics in a flight simulator I've played to date.  With flight Simulator X I almost feel the helis were an afterthought addition because it lacks certain flight physics that require the constant adjustments required to keep the helicopters in flight.  In Take On Helicopters, the wind and added weight of personnel and cargo changes how the helicopters fly, the copters accrue damage and can feel like a rickety bucket of bolts, giving an impending doom feeling before they ultimately reach maximum entropy and fall out of the sky.  I had more than a few instances where I killed the Huey because I failed to properly finesse them through the trial without burying the throttle and burning out the engine.\n\nBugs:\nEvery simulator has it's glitches, I've seen more glitches in Flight Sim X than I have in TOH.  Only one instance have I seen a glitch and pressed escape, then selected skip in the menu.","February 3, 2015","true","28.0"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","24","27","0","0"

For some tutorials, you will be drilled to the last click, but for others, they give you a vague statement such as slowdown, and then you're on your own. A training system that went into detail into the tiny bits and pieces that make flying easier would have been nice, and as such I'm stuck forever trying to land a damn helicoper correctly.","December 20, 2014","true","3.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

BUT, in Arma III you can import a lots of maps now and they have higher visual quality. The map in this game has very little detail in buildings... and roads, streets are not even present. they are part of the ground texture... if you're looking for decent graphics, this is not for you.\nThe missions and story are decent. but the voice acting takes off part of it.\n\nTo make it short.\n\nBad voice acting makes the game not as intriguing as it could be. recommended only if you're REALLY into helicopters and want everything out there.\n\nPros:\n\n- Decent engine (Arma II) 9/10\n- Decent story line / missions 7/10\n- Map Size 10/10\n\nCons:\n\n- Map detail is horrible 4/10 (excludings building density)\n- Voice acting is laughable 2/10\n- Lack of indepth helicopters courses to improve flight 4/10\n- my bad english in this review.","April 10, 2015","true","13.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Played for a few mins, had awful performance issues and the controls were abysmal on a 360 pad...\n\nFast forward a little while and I bought a HOTAS stick and throttle along with a better graphics card. The difference was astounding. There was still another little issue though - using the hat switch for headlook is horrible. Fast forward a little more time and I got my hands on an EDtracker head tracking device. This was the final piece of the puzzle! With reliable head tracking and a half decent stick setup the game really begins to shine and also opened my eyes to a much more immersive experience in Arma 2/ Day Z mod.\n\nAnybody familiar with BI games knows what to expect, a diamond with little bits of ♥♥♥♥ on it :D TOH is no exception, god awful voice acting and the usual performance issues on lower end hardware but with a little forum scouring you can maximize the experience you will have with a bit of tinkering.\n\n*For anyone using high DPI settings in windows you will have end up with the missing mouse pointer bug. THIS is what completely did my head in with the game for a looong time, persevering with the methods needed to do any menu clicking (like starting a damn game session) especially graphics setup was a royal pain in the ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/herbaceous/recommended/65730/","herbaceous","Herbaceous","http://steamcommunity.com/id/herbaceous/","243 products in account","Bohemia Interactive have opted for a simulator-style flight model that has more emphasis on enjoyment with a 'feeling' of realism, rather than a full-on realistic helicopter simulation. This was a good decision, as helicopters are inherently difficult to fly. For the average gameplayer, this would almost certainly lead to frustration... Not a good recipe for entertainment.\n\nThe flight model they have opted for takes many of the helicopter's tricker flight dynamics and tones it down to a more manageable set of rules. There are three different difficulty modes, each offering more than enough of a challenge. The easiest mode adds a generous level of automatic corrections to flight, as well as a few extra navigational aids etc. while still maintaining a challenge.\n\nWith an added storyline to follow to spice things up, Take On Helicopters is a refreshing addition to a stagnant flight sim market and one that I highly recommend!","November 4, 2011","true","23.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Even on 'Veteran' difficulty... It shouldn't really be advertised as being advanced.\n\nI had sort of suspected that this would just be the helicopter parts of Arma, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, and to be fair its a little more than that. The flight models are more realistic than Arma, but they just still aren't that good.\n\nYou're able to make violent changes to the collective without any consequences. In a real helicopter, ANY change to the collective requires changes to the other controls.\n\nIn an out-of-ground-effect hover, the chopper behaves ok at first, collective needs to be higher than in forward flight, it wants to yaw and drift so you need to compensate, but you can then raise and drop the collective very quickly and ascend/descend as if on a ladder, with virtually no risk of a vortex ring state.\n\nThe cyclic and pedal response is far too instantaneous to be believable, the sheer speed at which you can change direction and attitude removes any illusion of weight and inertia. It never feels like a heavy vehicle hanging under a rotor system, but more like a go-kart driving on an invisible 'track in the sky'.\n\nAlthough I've not spent much time looking, it seems that the cockpits and avionics are also very simplistic and startup procedures are not very authentic.\n\nIt kind of feels like an Arma 2 mod, rather than something thats supposed to be a flight simulator. Oh and the music is apalling.\n\nAs a game, its quite pretty, seems fun enough and would be interesting to flight enthusiasts, but as a simulator it's quite poor.

Whether that appeals to you, is personal preference.","March 7, 2014","false","0.5"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","1"

Graphic is fine, career mode is very interesting and makes you curious about next mission everytime. But there are some conditions upon which I would recommend this game:\n\nFirst. This game is for those hardcore simulator players who grow up with games like Flight simulator series. For player with no simulator or real flying helicopter background this game will be very hard and often frustrating.\n\nSecond. You need a joystick for this game for sure. Joystick with trottle and twist function is minimum, pedals would be even better, but twist function do just fine. Me myself I have a Saitek Aviator and it is perfectly OK.\n\nThird. Lot of freetime and love for helicopters.\n\nSo all in all this a very good game for those who really knows something about helicopters and are willing to buy/have a good working joystick. I wouldn't recommend this for those who don't know what cyclic and collective is.\n\nVery good game for me and as Arnold likes to say: Intu da choppa!!!","August 3, 2014","true","20.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let's start with the Seattle map. It's a screen print from Google earth with a few hills and buildings. On one mission for the campaign you have to fly to a number of golf courses; one of which has a flat, screen print club house! The AI cars driving on the map are non-collidible. You can drive through all of them. The motorboat has no engine sound. The fps is absolutely appalling - even worse than ArmA 2 OA... The campaign script is naive and poorly written, the characters laughable and badly acted.\n\nThe flight mechanics are reasonably good. It's quite like ArmA 3 advanced controls. You don't fly around with your finger firmly pushed on the collective like in ArmA 2. You have to add and subtract torgue or lose control. This I rather like.\n\nThe buildings, as one can expect are mainly from ArmA 2 and A2OA.\n\nIf only BI knew how to optimize and game engine or would at least employ some people who did, this would be a start.\n\nI can not recommend this game, I'm afraid. It's just too shoddy and unfinished.","July 18, 2015","false","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very blocky & basic. The building look like boxes, the land itself looks like flat satellite photos. Inside the cockpit again the overall look is blocky & basic. I put all setting on highest, which made no difference.\n\nIf your looking for a quick easy flight, from the start it's no "Just Cause 2" (jump in a plane & off you go) I found it took me a while to get used to the controls, even then I still found it awkward with the keyboard combinations. Flying around seems slow even when flying at over flight speed of 200+ I won't be getting anywhere fast! Don't get me wrong I do appreciate this is a simulator. The music choices while flying, say no more......\n\nI will give it another try, just my first impressions were of dissapointment! Would I recommend at the moment no.

I've maxed out all the settings and it still looks bad.  (I cannot increase the terrain detail level above 'normal' even with my pretty beefy PC).  Everything else is on 'very high'.\n\nSecondly, the menus are badly designed and it's difficult to figure out where options are configured.  For example, how to repair the helicopter.\n\nThirdly, even flying with a Logitech Dual Action Controller (similar to XBox), it's very difficult to accurately control the collective and cyclic while selecting options on the keyboard and mouse at the same time.  I think this game requires a proper pilot controller with pedals as well as track-ir to be able to look around the cockpit at options etc.\n\nI will probably continue on with the career mode for a little while, but I am very disappointed overall.","May 11, 2015","false","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

I am admittedly having issues early on with a challenge - hover over a spot over the water - without and visual references besides the HUD spot and its distance from ya - yeah its tough - maybe a new track ir would help - even better... GROUND! lol - |I'm whining - that's my struggle - the game though?\n\nWell - considering I love simulators and often find myself not really having anything to do in them - "awesome heli/plane - flies realistic - totally! .... ok - looks nice outside - ok - now what? it gets old! I use FSEconomy web site to make my x-plane and ms-flight sim more fun - as you then have passengers, people in the community own FBO's on airports all over - you can too - etc... fly freight, buy planes, fuel... makes it fun....\n\nAnyway - this game does that from the start. Voices sound drab or whatever? Dialog sounds "c movie" - I" think its great. The fact that |I'm not reading subtitles and their is enough animation and stuff... well - keeps me entertained... and then the missins to go with the story - awesome!\n\nI think its better I'm stuck on a mission then ripping thru the game - if it finishes - I might be stuck without much to do - that would stink! I haven't got that far...so I don't know how this will pan out - but its a fun simulator/game hybrid - and I think most of it is all spot on flying wise - pretty much.\n\nIt can be frustrating in any computer simulation to fly a helicopter, plane and whatever else because you want to turn your head all over all the time whenever and not getting that - well - even with track ir (which helps) its kinda trickier in a game they say - you can't feel forces etc... ) Anyway - moving your head fast, exact is as important as the controls - as the whole need for hand eye coordination is at a premium when you're airborne and dirt is racing by your shoulder only feet below! Moo wah hhahah Weed Whacking the lawn!\n\nThis game is a kick - I don't think you'll hate it if you like helicopters a lot, flying a lot, etc - but note this does kinda lean toward difficult to fly helicopter simulation - so - prepare to practice a bit and get a joystick and pedals if you can! Track IR even bettter! Maybe occulus workjs too - I dunno - but those shutter glasses on LCD screens... versus the tube kind - nope - yuk - don't bother! get a vr helmet first!\n\n\nGreat Game!","May 17, 2015","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very blocky & basic. The building look like boxes, the land itself looks like flat satellite photos. Inside the cockpit again the overall look is blocky & basic. I put all setting on highest, which made no difference.\n\nIf your looking for a quick easy flight, from the start it's no "Just Cause 2" (jump in a plane & off you go) I found it took me a while to get used to the controls, even then I still found it awkward with the keyboard combinations. Flying around seems slow even when flying at over flight speed of 200+ I won't be getting anywhere fast! Don't get me wrong I do appreciate this is a simulator. The music choices while flying, say no more......\n\nI will give it another try, just my first impressions were of dissapointment! Would I recommend at the moment no.
