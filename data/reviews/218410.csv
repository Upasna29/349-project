So it’s seem odd that I would even buy this game, let alone log 196 hours (wait, how many? I’m not even done with the Play+.)  What made the game appeal to me was the RPG element.  I like RPGs, it’s reassuring to know you can grind and level up to make up for your lack of skill and intelligence.\nThe game offers 25 stages plus bonus levels that are all replayable (didn’t realize that’s not a real word) at not just different difficulties but also with a different mix of enemies.  There are only six characters (towers) but each has 10 or so skills which adds to the variety.  There are 19 enemies including repallets (figured that wasn’t a real word) and five bosses.\nThe best part is the characters.  The dialogue and interaction is engrossing often hilarious.  The replay mode unlocks Azra’s diary with extra (also hilarious) insight to her background and the other characters (SPOILER ALERT!! Slak knows how to read and write.)\nIn conclusion (that never gets old,) Defender’s Quest: title too long is a great mix of tower defense and RPG.  Most importantly, it’s fun.  If you had to pay all 15 bucks for this game, it’s worth it.  If it should happen to be on sale around Thanksgiving or Christmas (or whatever other holiday you celebrate on your fast track to hell) you’d be a fool not to buy it (unless you’ve got something better to do with 196 hours, like work.)","November 26, 2013","true","233.3"," 196 of 210 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","196","210","3","13"

As a commander, you can recruit troops, equip them with weapons and armor and control their few skills when leveling up. It is pretty basic, yet very deep. The levels are single screen and grid based. You place your characters down and they automatically attack as enemies approach them. There are 6 classes, a basic melee, long range, healer, ice mage, slow defensive breaker and all powerful dragon with short and long range attacks. It costs PSI to place your characters, and more PSI to retract them (to move them).\n\nHow do you get PSI? Well you start with it, but then as you kill enemies, you gain more PSI and you have a maximum of course. You are defending a summoner against the waves of enemies and the summoner (your player character) can take a beating and has plenty of HP, so the game is forgiving, but rewarding if you make it through the level without being damaged.\n\nYou can 'boost' your characters at the cost of PSI. There are many levels of boos that enable skills that you've unlocked through leveling up your characters. When you level up your characters, you select their perk. Which has a simple perk tree of skills and passive abilities. It is a nice little system, but I find myself making the same perk choices instead of diversifying.\n\nOh and death is not perminant for your characters. If someone dies, just use PSI to bring them back. If your player character dies, you lose the level and need to restart. These levels are quick, especially at 4x speed, so nothing is really lost.\n\nWhile the game boasts a rich story.... I found myself hitting the skip button. I just don't play games for the story. You read the story as you unlock new levels and progress through a Mario World style map with all of the levels plotted as map points.\n\nThe game is very easy to pick up and play, but not just that, it encourages replaying the levels with 3 different difficulties (and a 'casual' difficulty as a 4th). If there's an insurmountable level.... replay old levels *cough* grind. But replaying old levels never seems like a chore, its more of a joy. Even if you keep replaying the same level on the same difficulty, every playthrough is different, since your characters level up and you can change your tactics.\n\nThe game is a lot of fun, and while its deep, its never overwhelmingly deep. There's not an overwhelming micro management either, even if you can micro manage everything.\n\nI highly recommend it. Its a fun little game, relaxing and never gets all that intense. I found myself playing it on 4x speed and that seems like it should be the average speed. Is it worth the $15? Its a game you can sink hours and hours into, so you'll get a lot of relaxing playtime for your dollar.","March 30, 2014","true","27.2"," 51 of 58 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","51","58","0","4"

See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:Defender Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is a 2D game with a unique blend of TD and RPG from Level Up Labs. It features characters / companions who act as 'towers' and need to be strategically placed around the map to defend your main character Azra. Unlike a tower defense game, however, you can level up and equip items for your companions to help them improve in combat.\n\nYou take the role of Azra, a royal librarian of the Kingdom of Ash which is currently being ravaged by a plague. Azra gets infected and thrown into 'The Pit', a place where all dead or dying are placed to keep the kingdom safe because those who die from the Plague become 'Revenants', undead monsters that are immune to physical harm. Azra soon discovers that she has the power to enter both the living world and the 'Half-Way' world, a place between the living realm & the realm of the dead. In this realm, she can summon her companions to fight the Revenants in their spirit form and eventually kill them.\n\nPROS:+ Refreshing new mix of genres\n+ 8-bit sprite art style that works well with the game\n+ Character / Companion progression is deep and extensive\n+ Well designed Maps and Mazes\n+ Very challenging difficulty levels\n+ 6 base classes (towers) which can progress into different builds depending on your play-style\n+ Dialogues between characters are humorous\n+ Steam Workshop support\n\nCONS:- Cutscene art work could use a lot of improvement (especially the character designs)\n- Story is a bit weak\n- Balance issues (some classes are outright better than others)\n- Some necessary but boring grinding sessions to progress\n- No real 'HD' or Widescreen Support\n- No Steam Cloud Support\n\nCONCLUSION:It is a GOOD GAME and one of the better tower defense games out there. I can easily recommend this game if you're looking for a challenging and unique game since it mixes RPG elements to the tried-and-tested Tower Defense genre. The 8-bit sprites, animations and effects are nice and work well with the game's art style although the Cutscene artwork could really use improvements. The levels are very well planned and are fun to play. Finally, the in-game dialogue between your companions is funny and quite entertaining.\n\nI can easily RECOMMEND this game even at full price since it’s only $14.99 or your regional equivalent. With simple graphics, this game is not system requirement heavy and can easily run even on netbook computers making this a perfect game when you're on vacation, working, passing the time, or in any other situation where you are not with your main gaming system.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

I find them repetitive, grindy, bland, and not innovative.\n\nBUT, Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is a true gem in the tower defense genre. It combines the elements of a tower defense game along with rpg elements, which gives the game a surprisingly fun twist. Instead of just placing troops that do not have meaning around, I was able to level up my characters and as I progressed I learned their stories.\n\nDefender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is not only a tower defense game, it has a story, unlike many games of the same genre. The story was nothing special, but there was a story nonetheless.\n\nIf you're an achievement hunter (♥♥♥♥♥) like I am, then you'll be disappointed because a few of the achievements are a bit grindy. On the other hand, the developers were nice enough to allow you to go into the Options and increase exp and gold gain by 300%. I cannot stress enough how this option is amazing and that I think more devs should implement it, because of how grindy some achievements are. This also makes the game a little bit more on the easier side. I hardly ever lost a round. I can count on both hands how many times I've lost.\n\nThe game is very simple, I was able to beat the base game without generic recruits. I did recruit the generic characters in order to obtain all the gold stars/side quests. The UI is also very simple. Skill trees are simple. Everything about this game is very simple, easy to learn, and relaxing.\n\nIf you're looking for a casual game, then I'd definitely recommend this game. A lot of times, I find myself on this game when I am watching tv or a movie.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten. It's a true gem of it's genre and should not be dismissed so easily, just because it's a casual tower defense game.","February 6, 2014","true","15.8"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","31","34","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/218410/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","At first glance, Defender's Quest appears to be a silly little indie game with big dreams. The characters are bright and cartoony, and their dialogue is marked with sass. Their battle sprites display whimsical touches, like the ranger who spins her bow before firing. One of the promotional spellbooks Azra can equip, the Book of Face, introduces the Internet's beloved Trollface to the otherwise sword-and-sorcery setting. Focusing on the one-liners would be simple, as they are good. However, the core plot has heft: it would make a good Dungeons and Dragons campaign or fantasy adventure novel. Royal librarian Azra must survive in a quarantine pit the size of a small nation, while she's pursued by mysterious figures. It features conspiracy, betrayal, and explosions. Careful gamers shouldn't be surprised a USDA-certified English major wrote the script. The wacky comedy and childish in-fighting among Azra's companions allows the team to quickly bond. These light-hearted intra-party friendships and feuds add personal stakes to the more pervasive dangers of the pit. The story is delivered in slideshow style before every town and battle, tying the narrative neatly to combat.\n\nCombat is handled like a tower defense game. Enemies travel in waves from spawn points. As they walk into the attack range of stationary heroes, they suffer the effects of the heroes' attacks. The heroes are unable to move from where they're summoned, as they're doing combat on a spiritual plane where bodies just get in the way. The cornerstone of battle strategy comes from placing the six types of heroes in the appropriate location. After recruiting story characters (such as Slak, the madcap, murderous berserker), faceless extras of the same type become hirable. If that's all there was to combat, it would be a delightful diversion. However, each character gains experience points, which can be spent to learn new combat skills or boost existing ones. Once learned, most of these skills can't be used immediately. Characters must be boosted in battle, which draws from the same Psi pool Astra uses to summon allies and cast spells of her own. It can be a challenging balancing act to position the proper allies, keep them boosted, reposition troops to respond to new threats, and maintain wide scale battlefield control with Azra's spells. Thankfully, slowing the game's speed (and pausing it altogether) are simple options. The keyboard commands are simple to learn and encourage faster play, but nothing's wrong with the mouse either.\n\nWith all the moving parts that go into battle, the multiple levels of accessibility are a nice touch. Each character has nine different attack modes including "attack the strongest enemy" and "attack the enemy with least immunity to status effects." Understanding the interplay between these attack modes isn't necessary for most of the core game, but integral to completing the optional levels. Furthermore, failure isn't necessarily punished. The default settings infer experience and money penalties for losing battles, but these can be changed based on individual preference. Redistributing skill points to explore different character builds costs money, but not a fortune. The steepest cost is the time it takes to click through all the advancements. The largest concession to the casual-vs.-hardcore debate is the option to increase experience points. Players who care more for the story and the thrill of rapid advancement can run with it. Players who want their hardcore bragging rights can lift their noses at the low-hanging fruit. True challenge-jockeys can set their sights on the more exclusive achievements, many of which are challenging even with gushing wells of experience points.\n\nDefender's Quest is a short game, but provides plenty of options to extend the experience. Completing every level at the highest difficulty takes about twenty hours; increasing the experience and money levels in the options decreases the playtime. However, the New Game+ mode, which becomes available after completing the base game, adds considerable challenge. The core story stays the same, but combat's modified with new enemy powers, new maps, and new bonus stages. The New Game+ also provides a delicious means of upgrading the magic items earned in the core game, unlocking unique modifiers for each relic. As enjoyable as these new features are, Azra's journal is the best addition to the New Game+. After every major battle, Azra updates her journal with commentary on the story. In the process, she details her internal struggles and fleshes out the world. The extra character moments in Azra's journal are enjoyable enough that their inclusion as bonus material seems strange. They'd serve the story better as part of its body rather than as bonus material.\n\nIn spite of all this praise, Defender's Quest isn't perfect. Despite the snap and crackle of the script, it features several glaring spelling and punctuation errors--especially in Azra's journal. Purchasing equipment isn't as interesting as other elements of character customization, but the numerical benefits encourage frequently clicking through upgrades. The music is initially encouraging, but loops quickly. Thankfully, it can be toggled independently of the sound effects, which provide texture and valuable combat cues. The final battle song is a notable exception. That beast should be blasted loud and proud.\n\nBetween its addictive gameplay and sliding difficulty scale, Defender's Quest offers gamers a great deal for such a small investment of time. It probably won't make a true believer out of anyone whose parents were killed by tower defense games, but it's good at what it does: drawing people in and refusing to let them go until they've finished "just one more level."\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=387148680\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","February 4, 2015","true","9.7"," 36 of 45 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","36","45","0","0"

I'll try to explain why I love it so much, and why I'm so excited for the sequel that was recently announced.\n\nMechanics\n\nThis game provides somewhat traditional mechanics if you're familiar with TD games. Players can build units on the perimeter of the path only, so there is no blocking/routing mechanics to worry about. Unit's have different attack types that are better and worse for some situations\nWhat is unique about this game is that units level up in a persistent manner between levels, allowing your units to grow over time, This included an entire skill tree for each class of units that can be customized to your play style. Additionally, units have a weapon and armor equipment slot and the game does a good job of making this meaningful by introducing rare equipment a bit later in the game.\nLevels are replayable so you can grind your team a bit if you feel a little weak or would like to beef up a bit before a boss level. To compliment this aspect of the game, each level can be played on different difficulty levels, which provide bigger rewards at the cost of a higher difficulty. This aspect of the game kept me going back and trying to beat my records and old levels in order to get some of the better rare gear.\nLastly, the game features a fast forward mode which is a welcome sight for those who play a lot of tower defense games. It really helps grinding out those later levels.\n\nStory\n\nIt's rare for a TD game to have an in-depth story, but Defender's Quest does a great job with this. It's not ground breaking, but it certainly sets a nice tone and even introduces a bit of moral dilemma that plays into the unit mechanics later in the game. I won't spoil it, but I will say that the level of narrative impressed me, and kept me engaged until the end.\n\nGraphics/Sounds\n\nAll standard stuff here. You can look at the screenshots and get an idea of what you're into. In general I'd say that the graphics do a good job of matching the needs of the gameplay, and the animations are smooth and crisp even during hectic late game levels. The graphics change into a pleasant style during story segments and do a good job of relaying the emotion and facial expressions of the characters.\n\nSummary\n\nAll in all, this game really scratched a Tower Defense/RPG itch that I'd been craving for a long time. If you can pick the game up on sale and like TD games I'd recommend buying it without hesitation.","June 28, 2013","true","14.7"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","25","28","0","0"

I used to play Warcraft III custom maps where the tower defense genre was cut from. Defender's Quest does a nice job of putting a well developed story with well developed characters into tower defense gameplay without it feeling pasted on.\n\nIt keeps it simple. There are only a few basic towers to choose from, but each tower acts like a character in your party and you can equip most of them with weapons and armor (no weapons or armor for a dragon and no armor for the barbarian/main melee guy). The maps are laid out well enough that consideration to where to place your troops does make a big difference.\n\nThere is also a nice take on the gameplay by offering 4 difficulty levels. You get rewards for completing the level, but you get bonus rewards for not taking a single point of damage. If you do that, you can get a lot of extra scrap (money) and unique items.\n\nWhat I'm doing on my second playthrough is going as far as I possibly can while only buying recruits and never any items on the easiest mode. When I hit my first failure, I go back to the very start and try to complete each level on the hardest mode possible. After I fail once, I will go down to an easier mode and so on until I am right back at the easiest mode and therefore, the furthest out I've ever been.\n\nThe main game is not that long and there isn't a ton of replayability to this game once you complete it. That is why it is only worth a few bucks...but it's worth a few bucks. I hear they are making a Defender's Quest II and I hope that is at least as good. Even when it is, this is still a pretty fun tower defense and something that feels more refreshing than you might think when you come back to it after a long time.","August 21, 2015","true","19.3"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","20","24","2","0"

But, it turns out that it's not your average build and kill game. For the first 4 hours I've been trying to finish up the story of the game. The story took me in and I just wanted to know how it all ends. If you are thinking about buying this game read on to see why you probably should.\n\nAfter playing 12 hours of the game I have finished the main story and went on to do some harder difficulties and other challenges. This game is fun in it's own unique way. Not only do you get an interesting story to follow, but also get stuck in character menu thinking how you should level up the skills for each fighter.\n\nThe only hotkey you will probably need to remember is "space bar" for pause. That is the only thing you will constantly hit to allow yourself some time to think before everything goes to hell. The game can be challenging even on the normal level. ( The level difficulties go as follows: Casual – Normal – Advanced – Extreme). After your done with Normal, you can move on to a New Game+, which is way harder and more challenging.\n\nAnd yes, this is an RPG game. You will probably spend more time looking at the level up menu for characters rather than fighting monsters. It's not bad at all, but be prepared to think and compare different builds for the same class of fighter. There are 7 types of characters – Berserker, Ranger, Healer, Ice mage, Knight, Dragon and Librarian ( who is the thing that you actually need to protect).\n\nThe simple graphics was also done in a pretty good way. All characters are different and you can easily tell the difference. Everything looks the way it should in this kind of game. The only thing I noticed is that when the Ice mage casts his spells it can be quite hard to see the enemy and how much health they still have. On a positive note, the graphics look smooth overall and you won't feel like your playing the game from the 80's at the same time. To add to this I can also point out that the soundtrack is very good. It fits the theme of the game very nice and allows you to feel emotions from the battle field and from dialogues.\n\nI am yet not sure how many hours you can play until you finish everything, but I would guess it's quite a bit. I think this game will keep you from sleeping for at least a few hours after you should have gone to bed.\n\nI honestly think that this game is a must have product for not just RPG and TD lovers but also for average gamers. If you have missed the sale don't worry, you won't regret buying a game for a full price.\n","January 28, 2014","true","15.5"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","2"

The story is simple but effective, not avoiding the cliches but embracing them and making them its own, but not with the wink and nod of the lampooner, but of a storyteller with an earnest wish to convey to you the world they've imagined. I found myself playing this game long after the challenge had worn away, drawn not so much by the game that had grown to be child's play after intense leveling, but rather by that very soul the creators instilled in it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaraKalat/recommended/218410/","MaraKalat","Mara","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaraKalat/","1228 products in account","This is my favourite game in years.\nIt's a tower defense game where each of what would normally be a tower is actually a character that levels up, like in an RPG, complete with a customizable skill tree, equipment, etc. These levels are earned from level to level, so you're constantly improving your party.\n\nThis superficially simple gameplay concept is backed up on all sides by a great story, deep strategy elements and amazing replayability.\n\nStory\nAzra (or the name you choose) is the royal librarian that ends up in The Pit, a wretched place full of zombie-like creatures called Revenant. Using mysterious special powers (that excellently explain the tower defense gameplay) and the help of a band of ragtag adventures you'll pick up it is your job to guide her out of the pit. There is more at stake, and the plot has plenty of developments to keep you interested, but what surprised me the most were the story's pacing and its humour.\nNo story segment lasts more than a minute or two, excluding the ending but not the opening, yet it tells a cohesive and engaging story. You'll never feel like the levels are just there to pad out the story or vice versa.\n\nStrategy & Replayability\nWithin levels you get to place your defenders along the paths your enemies will take to reach Azra. Doing so spends mana, so unless Azra has a lot of Mana (maximum mana increases by increasing her level) you'll need to consider which allies to summon. You can 'boost' these allies to unlock more attacks and increase their core stats, up to 5 times, this is equivalent to the traditional tower defense game's tower upgrade. Combine that with being able to place allies whenever you want, advanced targetting settings and certain allies working very well together while others negate some aspects of other powers (frozen vs. burning) and you have a deeply rewarding tactical system.\nIs this required to enjoy or finish the game? No.\n\nThe ability to play and replay any level you've cleared at any of 4 difficulties means that you set your own pace and your own challenge. On the lowest difficulty you can basically breeze through the game and just enjoy the story, never having to put a lot of thought into tactics or grinding, and the hardest difficulty will have you either rethinking your tactics or grinding a few more levels.\nClearing the game once, with any of its 5 endings (only 2 distinct ones really, one just has 4 different versions) will unlock new game+ mode parallel to the regular game mode. This features new powers for all enemies, several sidequests telling the story of one of the characters relevant to the plot, the ability to understand the 'ancient language' spoken in some of the dialogue and a 'journal' that offers lovely (and often hilarious) glances into the protagonist's mind as her journey progresses.\nIt will challenge you and reward you, and this is completely free extra content that was released months after the game was originally launched that is automatically included. I've put dozens of hours into this game and still revisit it regularly to see if I can't beat a few of the levels I still have problems with on a higher difficulty or to work on my Hero Mode run.\n\nSummary:\n+great plot\n+great tower defense gameplay\n+great RPG-style customization\n+replay levels\n+multiple difficulties\n+multiple endings\n+best way to do new game+\n-graphics are serviceable, but nothing to write home about\n-no voice acting (which to me is better than bad voice acting...)\n-Defender's Quest 2 isn't out yet, give it to meeeeee!","April 2, 2014","true","78.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I believe it offers the most hours of fun per megabyte of any Steam game I've played yet. I really enjoyed playing through it twice and sweating enough to unlock all the achievements.\n\nThe game scales in difficulty exponentially. This means that the easiest battles are actually the earliest, and that the game gets harder as it progresses. This is a welcome change from most games, but it's taken to an unnecessary extreme at the end. Finishing the final 10% of a full 201 star playthrough will be where you spend the majority of your time. Thanks to the level cap - which you will get to - you'll hit a wall in your ability to improve. That makes it feel repetitive and slow, because you're just repeating the same few battles over and over again, trying to make little tweaks to survive. Most of the game isn't like that, but it's a frustrating way to finish.\n\nThe game's story and characters are quite memorable and well-written. The dialogue is funny. I wasn't expecting that at all, especially from a tower defense game. It's actually one of the main reasons I'm looking forward to the sequel: I want to know what happens in this world to these people.\n\nThe graphics are a huge let down though. With no way to scale the sprites are locked in a tiny window. I found myself squinting just to tell what was going on. And I heavily considered lowering my resolution just to make things bigger. Thankfully an HD re-release is in the works, but the level of fidelity as is leaves the game looking like a B-level mobile game.\n\nDefender's Quest is not without flaws, but if you enjoy challenging tower defense gameplay where the story compels you to move forward then it's well worth a purchase.","September 11, 2015","true","37.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

This is most likely the biggest surprise in my entire library.\n\nI originally bought this game about two years ago. The Steam Trading Card system  had just launched into beta (remember when everyone thought it was going to be huge and a card could be worth $5?) and I had gotten in. Curious to test the system out, I found I at the time did not own any games on the short list of applicable games. I immediately did two things. First, I purchased Half-Life 2 since I had played that game on another account and knew it was good. Second was I started scanning the list for cheap games. This was on a daily deal sale the following day.\n\nI checked it out and saw that is seemed like a pretty generic, if solid, tower defense game. Felt like one of those particularly good flash games on something like Kongregate or Armor Games. Still, for 5 bucks, I figured it was worth a shot.\n\nAnd I wasn't entirely wrong in my expectations. This does very much feel like a buffed up flash game in a lot of ways. And then I asked myself if that was a bad thing. The gameplay is simple and understandable yet plenty difficult. Creativity is encouraged and different strategies will be required. The graphics weren't amazing, certainly not HD (though a HD update is on its' way at time of writing) but I feel like the art has character to it. This of course is helped by the fact that there actuually is a solid storyline in the game, more than many games I've played. The characters don't have a lot of screentime for development, yet I still feel like they are real.\n\nAll in all, this game I found to be a very good surprise. Don't expect a AAA level game, but do expect a game whose simple charm and solid gameplay will leave you satisfied. This game doesn't amaze, but it does the one thing that all games have to do. It's simply entertaining. The devs (who btw are super communicative and dedicated to their games) really did a great job with this one, and I look forward to their future work.\n\n9/10 - Highly Reccomended","June 13, 2015","true","24.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Lots of good, strong female characters here as well which is refreshing.\n\nEach level has an advanced and extreme version, which will require you to come back later when you're stronger. They're unnecessary to progress, but they will give you extra goodies if you go back and do them.\n\nCurrently on sale for $1.50, which is a steal, I'd consider it well worth it at the regular $15 for fans of good tower defence or tactics based RPGs.","January 27, 2014","true","21.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

This is that game, and I can't beam hate rays onto it because it takes all the irritating bits out of Final Fantasy such as grind and artificially lengthened gameplay out, and combines it with what makes tower defense ♥♥♥♥ing awesome: Intensity, efficiency, control. It would be up there with the classic Immortal Defense (and if you haven't played Immortal Defense, rectify that), but the story, despite being written by a 'real English major', flat out stands there and doesn't do anything.

However, that would be doing the game and the developers a real disservice.\n\nGranted, the 16-bit style is one you're either going to like or not, but it is executed very well indeed, as the use of colour is very done so that it remains pleasing on the eye and never jarring. The execution and balance of the game overall is very polished, and belies the developers' size - it really appears to be well-tested and difficulty is a very smooth and progressive curve.\n\nPacing is similarly excellent, and it definitely evokes that magic "just one more go" response. The icing on the cake is the story, which is nice and humorous without being too cheesy or vulgar, so it greatly appeals to a wide audience. As comedy is a very difficult thing to write, they have done a fantastic job here; it's very tongue-in-cheek, and it fits the game perfectly.\n\nThe meat of the game lies in having characters as your "towers" to place on a map. You can purchase extra characters to a maximum of 6 of each, and level them individually. The range of characters are well-defined (such as straight-up brawlers, archers, mages, healers, and even big ol' dragons), and afford some forethought as to their placing on the maps.\n\nThe length of the game is good, running at a good few hours minimum, but with the added replayability of New Game+ and more. Whilst the game might seem a little high for something that looks like an old game, it is well worth money, as it will entertain you from start to finish.\n\nFor fans of the genre, this is a must. Even for casuals, it's highly recommended.","November 27, 2013","true","84.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This game is simply awesome, it has everything a TD enthusiast could ever hope for. The game is quite challenging, which I consider a plus when playing TD games. I hate when TD games are overly simplistic and require very little strategy to win. Even when your characters are max level and you've obtained all the best gear it's still quite hard in the later stages of NG+.  Unit placement is extremely important as well as choosing the right skills/passives for your characters based on the level you're playing. On that note, the game has quite a few levels in the main storyline along which a bunch of bonus levels in the NG+ mode. The artwork is nice and the story is pretty decent. The characters are very likable and a bit comedic at times. I usually mute games and play my own music but I rarely did that with this game, the soundtrack is quite enjoyable. Overall I would give the game a solid 8/10.

If you haven't but like rpgs, this is your best bet to find out what a great TD can be like, with the RPG elements to help carry you along. Really, if the (very generous) demo to this game doesn't get you hooked, then tower defense may simply not be your genre, and at least now you know. ;)\n\n*** ***\n\nDefender's Quest is one of those games that without too much fanfare and fancy graphics simply get gameplay right. The rpg elements are well embedded, the story is not just an excuse for progression, the dialogues are well written and funny, the music is good and sets the mood nicely - but it's really all just about the balanced, fun, just-one-more-level gameplay.\n\nIt takes place in a plague colony, where the afflicted are turned into horrors controlled by a necromancer master villain. Your hero realizes she's capable of bringing herself and her allies into a halfway world, where the horrors and ultimately the villain can be fought with. While this is a simple enough premise, the way it brilliantly ties the story to the game's mechanics is one of the stellar design aspects of the game. (More on that here[www.fortressofdoors.com], if you're interested in game design).\n\nDue to the fact that you customize the appearance of your pawns, equip them with weapons and armour, and train them towards permanent experience that you can put towards an interesting skill tree, you end up becoming more attached to them then if you just had "towers" to play with. Especially your set crew of 6 archetypical towers/heroes is a fun bunch with entertaining banter in the (skippable) cut scenes, and by the end of the game you are genuinely interested in their actions and story decisions.\n\nI appreciated the attention to detail that allows you to customize both the difficulty and the game experience: active pause, different speed controls, highly configurable hotkeys, customizable general difficulty on top of the ability to replay maps on different difficulty levels (which actually play differently, instead of simply increasing the number of enemies or turning them into sponges). And then there's the Game+, which may just be even more fun to play than the normal game - if you can survive it. Plus, there's the sheep. Good luck with that. ;)\n\nWith its 30+ grindable main levels, the endless levels, a couple of different endings, a Game+, side missions to unlock and many interesting achievements, there is a very generous amount of content there for the price. Plus, a full HD/60 FPS upgrade is coming soon, for free, with redesigned graphics (the one aspect of the game that many may find lacking), so what more do you want?\n\nMaybe what you want is Defender's Quest 2, which is expected to come out some time in 2016 - giving you plenty of time to finish playing 1 first. :)","January 25, 2014","true","67.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I wasn't smart enough to stop.\n\n(1)  The tower defense gameplay was poor.  The appeal of tower defense games is usually to try and optimize your defense to be efficient and effective as possible against the oncoming force.   In Defender's Quest there are very few places where your characters can be placed rationally.  In other words, there was only one strategy to place your characters when you setup.  Since there were no other real elements to the game, this made it very boring.  When you lost a mission, you couldn't try and refine your process as there was nothing to refine.  You just needed to level up to get stronger.\n\n(2)  The character leveling up process was poor.  I decided to buy the game because the game boasted an RPG leveling-up process.  Although this is technically true, you DO HAVE TO CLICK A BUTTON in order for them to get more powerful, it could have been done automatically as your choices were thin, uncreative, and obvious.  Again, there was no game element in it.  You put the point where it was supposed to go and done.\n\n(3)  The storyline was not worth it.  I don't remember the storyline other than it seemed shallow.  The characters were the best part of the game.  Each character seemed unique and full of personality, but the storyline needed more to take away from the poor gameplay.  Because I liked the characters and I thought they were unique, it was a big letdown to find out later that you get more characters just like them gameplay wise.  Here you thought you had a unique crazy berserker guy or a badass ice mage, but no, they are just one of many.\n\n(4)  The enemies were uncreative.  The enemies were similar across the board.  At no point do you need to change your strategy based on the different types of enemies coming our way.    Some tower defense games have VERY uncreative enemies, but they don't need varied enemies as the game element is in the placing of the towers/characters, abilities, and tower synergy.  Defender's Quest did not have that.","June 11, 2015","false","16.9"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","18","32","0","3"

It's worth some money and time, but I wouldn't recommend paying full price for it.\n\nThe game bills itself as primarily a tower defense game. Tower defense games generally require you to come up with a strategy to defeat the enemies given a particular map and set of resources. Defender's Quest maps are much simpler, and to a large extent don't require much strategy. That's where the "RPG" part comes in. There's not really any role-playing going on, but your characters get stronger and you can buy better weapons and armor for them. The maps don't rely so much on strategy as on having characters that are high enough level and have good enough equipment. And that generally means grinding for XP. So when it comes to the advanced and extreme levels, it's not that the levels are possible but you have to have a better strategy. The levels are simply impossible to start with, and the only way you can beat them is by leveling up your characters.\n\nIn short, it's not a good tower defense game (because the challenges rely primarily on having high-level characters not strategy), and it's not a good RPG (because there's no real role-playing, just "numbers going up" as you and the enemy gain levels and equipment). So I think it rather fails the "tactical depth" promise.\n\nThe second promise is customization, and it does have options to rebind all the keys and change the XP scaling, character names and colors, etc., but I don't think it's a big deal. The developer also put thought into how he could accomodate people with certain disabilities (like epilepsy), which is nice.\n\nThe third is story, and I suppose that's where this game does best. The story isn't great, but it does give a reason to keep playing and it is fairly humorous in some parts.\n\nTechnically, the game is well-made, even if it appears dated. I can't recall any bugs in the game, and it has been very stable. The game runs at 800x600 resolution, which is fine for me. The sound effects and music are well-done, but lack variety, which is okay for me.\n\nI just wish the game rewarded thinking more than it rewards grinding. It's worth a try if you can get it on sale.","January 2","false","31.0"," 44 of 84 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","44","84","3","2"

Exceedingly generic title attached to yet another tower defense game... of course, you'd be missing out on a whole lot if you let that get in the way of you playing this game.\n\nLet me get this out of the way first: I don't like tower defense games. They usually bore me or frustrate me, and in worst case scenarios they do both at the same time. Defender's Quest deftly combines core tower defense play with RPG elements, a story that'll actually hold your attention, and beautiful artwork in and out of combat.\n\nSay what you will about simple spritework: it looks fantastic here. Units are distinctive, animate well. I absolutely love the artwork out of combat, and the writing is fun as hell. I came to really love the cast, and was sad when it was all over- well, not for long. Game features a New Game+ option that not only ups the difficulty a ton, it gives you access to plenty of sidequests and some very powerful items if you play your cards right.\n\nI've seen some complaints about this game lacking in depth of strategy- I don't find this to be the case, especially in maximum difficulty New Game+ battles. But one of the many wonderful things about this game is that its accessibility options allow you to tune the difficulty to your liking. Are you terrible at tower defense but want to see the storyline play out? They got you covered. Still having trouble? You can grind experience on earlier missions, too. Do you want this game to give you a merciless red-♥♥♥ beatdown and make you hate your life? Also an option! A+ to the devs for making sure the widest audience possible could enjoy their story until the very end.\n\nDefender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is a wonderful little gem of a game that should not be ignored. Highly recommend you give it a shot- I have a pretty good feeling that almost everyone is going to find something to like here.","May 23, 2014","true","28.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

For starters, rather than building soulless towers that you have zero attachment to, you employ RPG style characters to defend your "Librarian." These characters can be named, stylized (to a slight degree with color options) and then leveled the more they're used. They each even have a system of perks that can be unlocked through the course of the campaign. You can employ as many as you can find the dosh for, but each requires "mana" to be deployed in battle. This is a finite pool that is replenished by killing baddies. The maximum mana you can have increases as your librarian levels as well, so in essence it is a clever way of keeping the player from throwing 70 towers up at the start of a new mission and steam rolling.\n\nThe game also has a pretty humorous story line, and memorable main characters. There's unique items you can unlock for your favorite minions, and even a brutally hard Game+ mode if you desire even more once you finish the campaign. With such a low price point, this is a must have for people who like old school RPGs, tower defense style games or both.","November 25, 2013","true","31.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

YES. Well, almost completely yes.\n\nI hate this genre with a passion. I enjoyed those first one or two tower defenses I've played, and I'm consistently disappointed with every successive iteration that there is basically no variation whatsoever, especially given how crowded the genre has been. I think it's to do with tower defenses being easy to make, in terms of design, programming, and graphics, so that a lamentably successful game can be made on a dime.\n\nHowever, I do have to give this one game a recommendation. As much as I dislike the genre, this one definitely feels fresher. It blends significant RPG elements into the usual formula. Firstly, it has an engaging story, with plenty of humour and quirky characters. The levels support the story, including the occasional boss fight. Your "towers" are in fact your party members, belonging to six classes, who gain experience from encounters and level up to gain additional skills, or hone their own skills further. This allows for plenty of variation amongst your party, although I found myself sticking to a single formula for each of my types.\n\nThe gameplay itself is not typical of tower defense. There's no placing your people so that they block enemies; they must be placed on the sidelines of a preset path. Also, there isn't an emphasis on placing more and more towers to increase the length of the gauntlet. Although you can place all 36 members of your party in a level, doing so is generally not recommended, because it is far more efficient to simply upgrade the party members you have. The end result is a far more sparse tower defense game, one that greatly favours tactical placement, and consequently, can be fun for the most jaded tower defense anti-fan.\n\nI also appreciated the difficulty system, whereby you can choose from three difficulty settings when playing each level (and a fourth that doesn't exactly count, for casual gamers). You can also come back and play the level on a higher difficulty setting, with different enemy types and levels, to get greater rewards (like unique items). It really added to the longevity of the game. Add in some challenges to complete, and you well and truly get your $15 worth.\n\nSo, for the first time, I have played a tower defense that has left me wanting more! I'm keeping an eye out on Defender's Quest 2, which is currently in development. If you too are as jaded as I am, don't instantly discount this one. Give the demo a try.","June 21, 2014","true","13.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is no mindblowing gameplay or jawdropping graphics.  What it does it does small scale, but it delights in in each area.\n\nStory:  A very solemn themed game about war, sacrifices, dark gods, etc.  Fortunately the main cast have great (sometimes insane)  personalities and have wonderful, surprising, and often hysterical interactions.  This is where the writing really shines and is honestly probably the strongest part of the game.\n\nGameplay:  It's pretty standard tower defense.  Each class has skills, attack range, hit points, etc.  Set them up in likely positions and away you go.  Fail?  Try a different set up.  Characters also level up with experience for new skills, high attack, so forth.  Getting too easy? There's a Newgame+ with harder enemies and achievements that will test you.\n\nGraphics:  During gameplay it is high quality pixel art style, detailed and well done.  Cut scenes before and after battles are...I'm not sure what to call it.  Cell shaded stop motion?  It's nice and it does the trick without being flashy.\n\nLike I said, I just keep coming back for more, figured I might as well review it.  If you like tower defense games with interesting stories and well written characters, get this.","May 20, 2014","true","94.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Coming from a guy whose never really understood the interest people have in tower defense games, this game is just flat out fun.  The story is decent, characters are a little obnoxious but interesting, and everything about it is just so darn likable.  The combination of RGP, Stratedgy, and tower defense elements is something I personally hadn't seen done before, or at least not so well, and works better then it has any right to.  While the main game is relatively short, the amount of extra stuff to do and see in new game+ is a testament to just how much post-release work the developers have expended on this game.  Defender's Quest is an unquestionable labor of love and it really shows.  I picked this up on a the cheap during a steam sale and loved it so much I bought another for a friend and pre-ordered the sequel.\n\nIs this the best game I ever played, probably not, but was it great experience, definitely.

Its attraction to me is that this game is story-driven and the story is engrossing enough to keep me playing for hours. At the start, a dying girl is thrown into a pit to accept her destiny. But she doesn't. For unknown reason, she returns from the halfway to the hell. In return, the terrible experience on the verge of life and death gives her a new spiritual ability, making her capable of leading people to fight against the undead. As the game progresses, the mystery behind uncovers. This girl gradually comprehends her unavoidable destiny. She would meet many companions like warrior, archer, monk, mage and even the dragon.

While there is no option to advance the different waves, the difficulty of levels often makes you want to find ways to stop new waves from spawning. The RPG elements included in this game do not take away alot from a traditional tower defense game, but actually add a bit more strategy elements into the game. Like most games based around a story line, replaying the game usually ends up with you skipping the story elements in the game (yes, there is a skip button!) but I would strongly suggest reading the game+ version of the story as there are more plot twists and interesting parts in that story line than the orginal story line.

Hailing to the final fantasy tactics series with its strategic character placement and pixel art sprites. The unique blend of tactical RPG and Tower defence mechanics offers something familiar but fresh. With a fully customisable cast of characters and intricate levelling system, Defenders Quest is a western effort to try reinvent a diluted genre.\n\nYou play as the heroine Azra, the former royal librarian of the Ash Kingdom who is exiled to the ruinous outskirts of the city when found dying from the plague. On the brink of death, Azra awakens in a purgatory state to be attacked by a swarm of zombie like creatures or 'Revenant', and by using newly acquired magic and the assistance of a fellow surviving berserk mercenary – you journey through the Pit to uncover the secrets of these creatures and the valley. As you progress you accumulate a small army of companions of different class from swordsman, archers and dragons to face off against a number of tyrants to free the land from the plague.\n\nThe game primarily revolves around a linear story driven campaign that places you in the overworld of the pit. From here you enter battles that charge waves of enemies at you from designated points, trying to reach and attack Azra. To defeat each wave you tactically place your available units across the map using your Psi resource to do so. Each unit has unique abilities and resistances to overcome each wave. You can also recall and reposition each unit, but this consumes further Psi. Azra also has a host of abilities that can boost her own units and fend off the waves of enemies. Each battle has 3 levels of difficulty and as you progress on normal you can revisit a previous battle to gain further XP and stars.\nThe Overworld also acts as a hub for towns and lairs. Before battles you can visit these locations to recruit units or purchase more effective weapons and armour.\nYou can also complete bonus levels that offer intense challenges for greater reward after gaining enough stars.\n\nDefenders Quest is highly accessible but introduces a depth to tower defence that elevates it requiring the player to strategize and carefully consider how each unit is levelled and their positioning in battle. The character development is clearly influenced by role playing games, whilst removing the repetition and time associated with grinding. This effectively ensures your steady progression through the story whilst each battle holds new challenges.\nThe narrative is also highly original and maintains intrigue and invention that is expected of a good RPG. Azra is the sympathetic protagonist facing off against an unknown villainy.\nThe ability to pause a battle at any time emphasises the necessity to properly prepare your units placing them in the most effective positions and levelling them appropriate to the incoming enemies.\nThe game aesthetic is very nostalgic, calling back to the pixel art of classic JRPGs such as Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger. Each recruit can also have a custom name and colours, allowing you to personalise your army.\nThe main campaign is appropriately paced across seven acts, but encourages you to revisit past levels for bonus equipment and increased challenge. You can complete your army with any class of your choice as their unlocked, further increasing the range of tactics when battling and tailoring your strategies the units you've selected.\n\n\nThe breadth and uniqueness of the story is commendable and gives engrossing context to the battles. However the static cut-scenes through which its told at times become unnecessarily prolonged and tedious, after the initial character introductions we generally skipped through them to get to the battles.\nFurthermore there is a distinct characterised design to the figures in these scenes which drastically differs to the more befitting pixel models. This lack of consistency is also noticeable against the painterly backdrops.\nDefenders Quest is strongly reminiscent of its influences, but also tries to introduce a more detailed textured interpretation of its characters, that unfortunately leaves to big a void in the games overall presentation.\n\nWhat starts out as a charming and casual game soon evolves into a challenge.\nUnlike most tower defence games there is no such thing as the ultimate deployment to beat every level. Each battle requires a unique strategy, that sometimes requires you to fine tune each unit.\n\nWhilst tower defence remains primarily a casual genre, Level up Labs have crafted a game with a refined battle system and immersive world that requires a fair investment of the players time. Through adapting existing RPG conventions and introducing a few new parameters, Defenders Quest's perilous journey is worthy of the most battle-hardened players.\n\nWatch at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KVFiflbRco","February 7, 2015","true","23.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Defenders (towers, if you will), are named, geared and levelled up complete with talent trees to fight off the undead.  Graphics are poor, story is decent but also very humorous, the music is pretty catchy and also included for own listening with purchase, but most importantly the tower defending is genious and very, very rewarding.  Comes with new game++ modes and separate challenge missions promising a stupid amount of hours of game time.","November 10, 2012","true","112.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story was meh and there were far too many dialogue cut scenes (you can skip those). You progress your way across a world map, dotted with battles. As you progress you meet new characters and unlock new classes. Archers, dragons, swordsman, ice mages. There are skill trees for each class.\n\nEach battle consists of placing your characters in static positions to defend against waves of enemies that spawn on various lanes. It's pretty standard tower defense stuff. Certain classes do better against certain enemies. As you kill enemies you reclaim IP which can be used to boost characters and increase their powers for the rest of the battle. Nothing spectacular. I did appreciate the time controls so I could speed up 4x or slow down to 1/2 time as needed.\n\nThe problem comes when you encounter a difficult level you can't win. At that point you must go back to previous battles you've already won and play it on a higher difficulty. This yields scrap (basically money) and XP, sometimes a unique weapon. You'll have to do this a lot. Unfortunately it gets tedious after a while.\n\nIt was an interesting concept and I did manage to finish the game. But honestly I wish it wasn't so repetitive.","May 13, 2015","true","14.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I don't even remember why I decided to try the game on a whim but I'm SO glad I did. The story is interesting and, even better, funny. There's tons of really good characters and the devs have done a good job of creating a story that walks the line between silly and serious pretty well.\n\nIn terms of the gameplay, like I said -- I don't particularly enjoy tower defense, mostly because the ones I've played previous to this have all seemed far too complicated to be worth the time and effort. Prior to Defender's Quest, the game that I've enjoyed the most in the genre was Plants vs. Zombies. Defender's Quest is a step above that, really, because DQ actually attempts to have a story and character development, though the basic goals of the two games are the same. I'd say DQ is a little bit tougher than PvZ, if only because there's a lot more variability in the maps, whereas PvQ was a fairly straight-forward flat plain. DQ offers maps with multiple enemy spawn points (three is the most I've seen so far), different terrain (e.g., water vs. land), and various restrictions in routes for enemies (and placement for allies). I especially enjoyed the way you can change battle speed to slow down -- or pause -- the enemies spawning to catch up or speed up (4X is amazing) if you're sure your allies can handle the enemies without much management. It's a nice mix that I liked, because I prefer to micro-manage at the start, rather than during the battle. Even better is the different battle difficulty settings, so you can go back and replay battles on a harder setting (same map, different enemies) PLUS bonus challenges and (so the achievements would suggest) a new game plus mode -- means there's tons of stuff to do.

I love its art style and combat mechanics. Its a refreashing take on the Tower defense genre with some fun rpg elements mixed in. You name you heros, level them, and find new equipment for them. Then these heros are used in a tower defense acting in place of the towers. The combat is like Final Fantasy Crystal Defenders.\n\nThe conversations are quite amusing and the story thus far has been pretty entertaining and is keeping me hooked and wanting to learn more. I also love puns so this game gets points there.\n\nThere are two big complaints I have for the title though. The biggest is that you have to run it at a fixed resolution in windowed mode. The window is so small it could very well fit on an 8" tablet. This means playing for an extended period will likely hurt your eyes. I really wish I could make the game bigger without having to use fullscreen. The second complaint is the sound. It gets very bad when you have a healer and ice hero on the field. Especially a 4x speed. I would recommend turning the sound off and either listening to the in game music or playing your own. There is not voice acting so you wont be missing anything.","May 11, 2014","true","13.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Instead of using Towers you call forth allies to your astral plane (Current Map) to help defend yourself from Revenent's (The bad guys).\n\nThere are several different Allies to choose from and each ally can be specifically tailored for any given purpose. There is a suprising amount of depth involved in deciding where to place your unused talent points. Each character is Namable and has cosmetic customizable options. Naming a Character after yourself makes you want to use that character which is alot of fun to role play. If your into that sort of thing.The town's have places to recruit new allies and buy new weapon and armor.\n\nThe map plays out alot like Mario World or the equivalent and you can go back and beat older levels on harder diff's to get better gear and level. There is also a storyline written by some type of Wrinting/English major and the writing isn't too terrible. Some if it will give you a laugh and some will just make you scratch your head. But all in all this game is a lot of fun and is definitely worth the little money asked.\n\n-Casey","January 31, 2014","true","11.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Defender's Quest may look like a 10 minutes casual game but it's not. It has an incredibly long story and it's full of challenges. You have a great control over difficulty in this game as each stage has 4 levels of difficulty, which also makes this game very replayable, as you'll need future gained strength to beat the 4th level of past stages.\n\nDespite of my lack of interest in RPG, the mix with Tower Defense is so good and balanced that I really enjoyed that part. You can have your very own and custom gameplay, as you plan your own team, choose how they evolve and choose the gear they equip.\n\nDefender's Quest is a great tactical game, it gives you a lot of freedom to test different strategies and it can give you different gameplay experiences based on your own choices and it doesn't get repetitive, something that is easily found in any other Tower Defense game.\n\nGonchito approves this!

I don't even remember why I decided to try the game on a whim but I'm SO glad I did. The story is interesting and, even better, funny. There's tons of really good characters and the devs have done a good job of creating a story that walks the line between silly and serious pretty well.\n\nIn terms of the gameplay, like I said -- I don't particularly enjoy tower defense, mostly because the ones I've played previous to this have all seemed far too complicated to be worth the time and effort. Prior to Defender's Quest, the game that I've enjoyed the most in the genre was Plants vs. Zombies. Defender's Quest is a step above that, really, because DQ actually attempts to have a story and character development, though the basic goals of the two games are the same. I'd say DQ is a little bit tougher than PvZ, if only because there's a lot more variability in the maps, whereas PvQ was a fairly straight-forward flat plain. DQ offers maps with multiple enemy spawn points (three is the most I've seen so far), different terrain (e.g., water vs. land), and various restrictions in routes for enemies (and placement for allies). I especially enjoyed the way you can change battle speed to slow down -- or pause -- the enemies spawning to catch up or speed up (4X is amazing) if you're sure your allies can handle the enemies without much management. It's a nice mix that I liked, because I prefer to micro-manage at the start, rather than during the battle. Even better is the different battle difficulty settings, so you can go back and replay battles on a harder setting (same map, different enemies) PLUS bonus challenges and (so the achievements would suggest) a new game plus mode -- means there's tons of stuff to do. Playing DQ actually makes me want to go out and find similar tower  defense games to play because I enjoyed this one so much -- which is probably the best compliment I can give a game!","February 22, 2015","true","10.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/218410/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4393 products in account","An original approach to story design and a nice take on tower defense, Defender's Quest places you in the role of Azra, a librarian who gets epic powers to fight the otherwise invulnerable undead.\n\nThe story has been designed from the ground up: taking the game mechanics of upgradable towers who gain experience to become stronger ("like an RPG"), a story to fit the mechanics has been devised. Quite like when you were presented with the task of making up a story and including certain words or characters, only Level Up Labs made a game out of that. The benefit is mostly avoiding pitfalls growing out of weird game mechanics. IMHO, while the story did not blow my mind it is still very fine and the result works quite well.\n\nSo, like any tower defense, you defend a place from creeps that have different stats and abilities by placing "towers". In this they're game characters who have their own class and the associated, developable skills, i.e. attacks, buffs and debuffs. Azra summons them up and places them into the labyrinth in suitable locations. Every character is useful and has their role: to spell it out no one works as an instakill device against everything. The enemies always follow shortest path towards Azra, so you can plan accordingly even when some enemies can swim. Finally, if the troops fail, you can beat the horde back with spells. Everything uses kills for money.\n\nOn the world map, you move along a linear path that sometimes diverges for sidequests. Every space is either a level with attacking waves of enemies or a town where you can buy weapons and armor and recruit troops. Story advances in every space so you're never bored unless getting stuck in a difficult level. That does not happen often, for the easy levels are really easy and you can even go to casual difficulty and/or set experience and money gain to 3x normal for faster leveling up without any penalty. You do get better rewards for higher difficulties, and to master a level it has to be beaten on extreme: this always rewards you with a special item granting the incentive for beating them all, if the associated achievement won't do it alone. You can also return to beat the levels again after you've grown in strength.\n\nWhen the levels run out, there are several "challenge" levels to beat, two of which are of endless type with ever-so stronger incoming waves. After beating the game you can also give it another go with NG+ that is more difficult with monsters getting additional special abilities. NG+ also adds several additional sidequests and its own version of the challenges.\n\nWhile the flash graphics aren't eye candy, the music is engaging and the residing mechanics will let you enjoy the game for several tens of hours. However, trying to beat every level perfectly can become tedious, for the levels get tougher and tougher as you advance. Typing this, I've yet to beat the last few levels on extreme. Still, I would heartily recommend the game for tower defense fans: I sure got a blast with it. I especially recommend going for the Hero Mode+ challenge (and to lesser extent the Hero Mode++).","December 27, 2013","true","49.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The horde which is consist of a few types of zombies, slug-like creatures,... keeps coming in pre-defined routes. In fact, there's nothing quite unique in the mechanic of TD in this game.\n\nHowever, the true gem lies in the RPG aspect of the game. What's a TD game without towers? Nah, your towers now are replaced by class-based characters ranging from a psychopath to a cute dragon. Many elements of RPG genre are brought into the game like skill tree, equipments and again, classes. Trouble with fast moving creeps, you have an Ice Mage to counter, or facing heavy armor zombies with the might of a Paladin.\n\nNot every maps are so hard, but you still need to grind a little for exp and especially epic items. (well, not really that epic but atleast they have purple titles)\n\nTo be honest, you can't expect a long and heart-touching story with dozens of play time for such a small game like this, but for almost 3 hours so far I'm quite satisfied.\n\nFinally, thanks jatan11t/GAR for this lovely gift :)","November 27, 2013","true","17.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It is not terribly difficult to beat the game, however new game + and the secrets hidden in the game are very difficult.

What's more, it never loses its intuitive and elegant design as it becomes more mechanically complex, and the game does a fine job of presenting you with a tough challenge but essentially giving you all the tools you need to overcome said challenge. Success is not determined simply by grinding to level up your characters, but rather by finding a way to better manage your resources until you find the optimal way to succeed.\n\nThis was one of my sleeper hits from 2013, and it's one of my favourite tower defence games on Steam, up there with Defence Grid: The Awakening and Plants vs. Zombies. It's a great starter tower defence game and introduces less experienced players to its mechanics in a very manageable way, but it also provides the depth and strategy that you just won't get from most of the free flash-based TD games you can find online. It's a fresh take on the genre and its very well executed...just don't expect to be too engaged by the cutscenes and character interactions that break up the combat missions. They're occasionally funny, but often rote and unnecessarily long. But that's just about my only criticism of the game - everything else is rock-solid.","January 25, 2014","true","22.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You can also equip items to your "towers" in order to make them stronger and there are also skills that improve them a lot, which as opposed to just upgrading the "towers" so they do more damage and things like that.\n\nI like these kind of games a lot, I would say since back when Warcraft III had that kind of deal going. I am sure there was in Starcraft, but I wasn't able to access B.net at that time. For me the fact that it's an RPG/TD caught my attention, because I like RPGs and well, combining RPG with Tower Defense is no easy deal, right?

Defender's quest is different, and different good.  The game strikes that perfect balance by replacing the "towers" with NPCs.  The difficulty ramp-up is near perfect for a game and gives you as much challenge as you want without subjecting you to any levels where you fall off a difficulty cliff.  If something's just a little too hard, or you're trying to get a better result?  Level up your guys or buy them beter equipment.\n\nYes, the game runs at a fixed resolution and no, the cutscenes (which tell an engrossing tale) are done with limited animation, but that's really OK.   The limitations don't detract from the game and you can tell all of the love and time and effort went into perfecting gameplay and giving you plenty of it.\n\nIf you're lukewarm on tower defense because you don't like the repetition, this game's for you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Venesect/recommended/218410/","Venesect","Venesect","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Venesect/","597 products in account","I wrote a review for this about a year or so ago but thought I'd rewrite it as I have some different and new views on the game.\n\nFirst off, this is a tower defense game that revolves around a well written story with a nicely done narrative that includes all the who/what/when/where/why questions, along with moments of subtle humor and despair. On the first play through you get all the character dialogue that propels the story but not a whole lot more. On the second play through you get the main character's (Azra unless otherwise named) thoughts after each mission is completed. These journal entries go pretty in-depth for being subtext you don't even need to go through. There are some 30 entries and I do recommend reading them.\n\nThe game starts with the Azra wondering where the hell she is and finding the first warrior, Slak, entering into a battle against the Revenant (dead). The story progresses and you will find all the other characters (read 'towers'). There are six others you find and you can have up to six of them in that class, in total allowing you to have an army of 36 towers and Azra.\n\nThe Berserker is a hack 'n' slash guy. He wields a sword, wears no shirt, and thirsts for blood.\nThe Ranger is your snarky and quick witted bow expert. She often griefs Azra on menial things such as, "not being pretty enough to have her plans work out."\nThe Healer comes off as overprotective and cautious but holds the team together.\nThe Ice Mage is cold and has cynical tendencies but wields the power to stop hordes of foes.\nThe Knight is rightous and pledges himself to Azra. He takes down the strongest enemies by ripping them of their armor.\nThe Dragon is the last to join the group. She acts like a god and thinks the humans beneath her yet is impressed at how far Azra and her companions have traveled thus far. She also enjoys eating sheep.\n\nWith these characters you can create varying strategies on every battlefield in the game. Some will require a near exact positioning that you'll figure out by trial and error, while others are more liberal in placement. You can pull off a ton of combos though and it's cool to find something that synergizes well.\n\nNow, along with all the characters, each has a skill branch (not tree since there are only two directions it goes) and with each level you get one point to put in each skill slot. Most of them are damage boosts for their attack tier (each character has a five tier attack that is upgraded through Psi that is earned by killing enemies in the level) and the rest are passive buffs. They can include skill cooldowns, range, crit/poison/bleed/blind/armor piercing chance, slow/stun/burn, group damage amplifiers and tagging enemies so they take more damage.\n\nAzra also has six spells she can upgrade. There are three damage and three buff spells. A direct lightning attack, an area of effect crystal explosion, and a full screen flame attack. The buffs are sending your characters into a frenzy to increase attack speed, massive healing, and pushing back waves of enemies. There are also unlockable spell books that can be equipped to provide boosts.\n\nThere are three weapons in game that two classes can use. Swords for the Berserker and Knight, a bow for the Ranger, and staffs for the Healer and Ice Mage. Progressing through the story increases the price and damage of future weapons. Armor can be equipped to them as well, heavy and light variants.\n\nThe max level each member can achieve is 60 so you won't be able to max every skill on each character. The good thing about having multiple in a class means that you can have someone with a high bleed chance, and give the other person the higher armor piercing chance. At any point you can pay a small fee of scrap (currency) to respec their builds.\n\nSo that's the gist of the game. Pretty straight forward. Where things really get rolling are on the new game +. Much more challenging and rewarding. A new currency of "skulls" becomes used to upgrade the special weapons and armors you aquire through missions. It's pretty hard to get all the skulls as you'll need to grind to get your characters to a high enough level to beat the much harder than before levels. There are also a few puzzles hidden here and there that you need to keep an eye out for. I had some trouble with it and found a guide and without it there would've never been a way I'd have caught on.\n\nAll in all, more than your run of the mill tower defense game, great story, fun and unique characters, scaling rewards that only get better and better through all the challenges, and tons of replayability as there is mod support.\n\nOh, if you really want a challenge, there's an achievement to beat the game and new game + with only the original characters, not using any of the extra hired ones. And then getting 180 stars (awarded through level completion). That took a ton of time.","November 9, 2015","true","105.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

My recomendation is to WAIT for the free HD update before playing. Go ahead and buy it now if it is on sale.\n\n\nCounter review to all the fanboy hype for this game, as I just bought it on sale since it looked good and I needed something to play on my mac book.\n\nThis is JUST any other tower defense game. Because every tower defence game has its own unique mechanics for upgrades. The only thing this game "blends" is RPG lore/tropes into tower defense as a theme. This is done in that you upgrade individual towers and each tower levels up on its own. That's it. The blend is just graphical, and it does that poorly because the graphics are poorly done. I don't want to be harsh because I want to give the indie devs the benefit of the doubt in that they couldn't aquire funding/talent for aethistics, but this is worse than a free flash game I could have played instead. Another problem which just elludes to really ameature/cheap UI development is that the game cannot go into fullscreen correctly. It just remains at 800x600 and the fullscreen option simply draws a giant black box on your monitor and centers teh 800x600 game. Why couldn't they have actually developed the UI before releasing it...? Not really a pleasing game to play, way better TD games imho. A game like "Castaway Tower Defense" has much better graphics/UI/visual-imersion than this for example and is free.\n\nAs for the writing, it is cute but not good. Some of it is just wrong regarding vocabulary which is odd since one of the selling points was that it was "actually written by an English Major". For example, one of the bad guys loses his entire army and complains that his forces were decimated. Just bad and confusing writing, as the verb "to decimate" means to reduce by 10%. This is something that the Romans would do to their own troops to instill fear into them, to punish them, and to prevent rebellion. It is not something that would happen if you lose all of your army, that would be to have been obliterated or to annihilate.","October 31, 2015","true","1.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lexifox/recommended/218410/","lexifox","Finding Namor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lexifox/","297 products in account","A fun little tower defense with RPG elements. The protagonist is a librarian cast into a plague colony, and sets out on a quest to escape. She quickly discovers latent supernatural powers that allow others to defeat the zombified infected. She serves as the objective that must be defended. Besides the standard ability to summon units to defend her, she's also capable of casting spells for harming or buffing, and can equip spell books to further enhance her abilities.\n\nThroughout the game you'll encounter characters who join with you, unlocking new classes of characters (berserker, archer, healer, etc.) that you can hire and summon to defend you. The classes come with simple skill trees that unlock new abilities or enhance them in some way, and every individual unit can be leveled differently from the other, enabling a more diverse army to choose from.\n\nThe game is made for a wide variety of skill levels. New players and seasoned veterans alike will find something to challenge them when the game gets rolling, and you can replay maps as you please for practice or for XP/money. The map's rewards are better for higher difficulty settings, and can reward unique equipment for success. The game can seem like a grindfest, but the devs wisely included the option to increase XP/money gains and to ensure all units get equal access to it, regardless of whether or not they entered battle.\n\nThe story itself is very competent. The characters are largely likeable and the writing and humor is enjoyable. The cast tend to have something of an emphasis on their quirks, but mostly avoid becoming bland one notes with varying degrees of depth.\n\nThe game is not without its flaws. Completionists can find that the New Game+ might become something of a chore, the skill trees are rather simple in their execution, and certain parts of the story or characters can become tiresome (looking at you, Slak). If you can put this aside, you still have a fun and funny game that's worth a look. Grab the demo and give it a spin. You can even transfer your save file if you choose to purchase it, and the game is set to receive an HD update (at the time of writing) and sequel.","October 16, 2015","true","35.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

(Characters level up and have skill trees that carry over, although you can reassign points for a fee.)\n\nThe need to "gold star" everything keeps this game replayable for quite a long time, and there's a challenge to complete the game in its hard mode without the many generic units you can hire, making the game extremely difficult at times. (In fact, functionally impossible at the hardest versions of some levels. Fortunately, you don't need 100% completion for those.)\n\nThe game is also pausable, for those who find some tower defense games too frantic to enjoy.  There are some points where you really need to set the game to slow-mo and pump out the spells you get as their cooldowns time out just to cling to life for another wave, though.\n\nIt can, however, chug when you get to very high levels, and have INSANE numbers of effects going on at once.  I've also had it crash from a memory overflow from having too many sprites on the field in one of the "endless" maps where they just send infinite units your way.\n\nBeyond that one flaw, (which you can avoid by just not trying to play the endless mode truly endlessly,) it's a great game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lucca202/recommended/218410/","Lucca202","Lu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lucca202/","134 products in account","Let me start by saying one thing: I don’t like TDs. Too many of them revolve around mechanics I consider boring, such as interest, and generally, they don’t offer much beyond the core, basic gameplay expected from the genre. With that out of the way, I’ll try to explain how Defender’s Quest won me over.\n\nIt’s impossible not to mention the fantastic writing present in the game: The story is overall serious, but the script makes no commitment to sounding mature or gritty. To the contrary: while some may argue the cast is composed of very standard archetypes, it’s still highly varied, and the humorous exchanges between the characters are a joy to see. Ironically, it’s their likability that makes the story much easier to care about, not presentation or “visceral” experiences. Take notes, games industry.\n\nWhile I’m at it, the soundtrack is also a very strong point, and is included in the game’s folder for free. Plot and music are hardly all the game has to offer, though. As I said, I don’t like TDs and what impresses me the most about Defender’s Quest is how it carefully avoids annoying mechanics I’ve come to associate with the genre.\n\nIn this game, you don’t have to worry about insane resource management (interest) or fast finger movement (since you can pause mid-wave). It’s only about character loadout and positioning. That doesn’t mean it’s easy, but that it’s the right kind of hard. That it offers depth.\n\nGoing through the game should take you about five hours, but that can increase tenfold if you try to finish all level variations and challenges. For me, it clocked at just over sixty hours, and was definitely worth its price. I can recommend it to anyone looking for a twist on the traditional TD formula.","February 4, 2014","true","61.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

ME IN!\n\nThe game plays like traditional tower defense, with RPG elements like levelling up, buying armour and upgrading skills.\nThis gives a feeling of progression since in more traditional tower defense game its all about strategy. Every battle is a new battle, nothing carries on to the next level.\n\nIn this game, your heros are permanent allies. You recruit them from towns, form your own little army and grow them accordingly to your preference.\n\nStory wise its ok and the dialogues are funny at times. The presentation of the whole game is quite neat and easy on the eyes so you dont get alot of useless stuff displaying to you.\n\nThere seems to be quite alot of levels as well as a new game plus where you get unique stuff and enemies which adds replayable value.\n\nThe only downside is that it seems the skill tree could get some more diversity. Like it would be awesome if a standard warrior can have different styles or something.\n\nBut all in all this is a solid game and is definitely worth grabbing during this 1.49 USD sale. The fun far exceeds the cost. But if you missed the sale and it goes back to 14.99, I would recommend you to think twice before buying.","January 25, 2014","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you like Tower Defense games and are looking for something new to mix up what is becoming a stale and tired formula, this game is right up your alley. While allowing you to build your characters in the way that you want, customizing your 'towers' becomes a pleasure rather than a chore. The clever use of characters to perform as your towers is a fun way to almost get to know the defenders that you're using, and the story, something that most tower defense games shirk is actually quite amusing. Give it a try if you're wondering what it is about, this game delivers a lot of bang for your buck, offering hours and hours of replayability. The New Game+ feature completely mixes up the challenges so that even when you beat the game you're just getting started.","January 8, 2014","true","15.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Played it start to end twice in a row and had a blast all the way thru.\n\nFor those uninitialized: Defender's Quest is a Tower defense with heavy RPG elements. Your "towers" are characters you recruit thru progress of the game. You level them up and give them skillpoints and equip them with weapons and armors. Your characters will be with you the entire playthru and level up with your character.\n\nThe goal per usual is to stop the enemies from reaching your "pool" and taking away from your life. This is done thru set mazes where the monsters have to follow a premade maze, so sorry, no mazing for you that like to build your own mazes in TDs. You progress thru a gameworld where you can face each stage in three various difficulties, the harder it is the better the reward. You can also backtrack to previously defeated levels to try it on a harder level or just grind for gold/xp for your characters.\n\nThe game also offers a fairly interesting story with alot of written dialogue with some pretty nice graphics to go along. The steam version also features updated graphics to the game which makes the game feel apropiate for the pricetag.\n\nA must have for lovers of classic Tower Defense games with a twist and interesting new mechanics.","December 3, 2013","true","27.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm only about halfway through, but, well, I was only expecting to dip my toes into it when I launched it today, and instead it ate up most of my evening.\n\nEssentially it's tower defense game with RPG mechanics and a story. Like, a proper story, that gives most RPGs a run for the their money.  That and the RPG mechanics give an attachment to your characters (who act as the "towers"), and a sense of progression, that make this game so much more than most tower defense games. The game seems to reward focusing on a small but powerful party, and I just find "making my friends way better at murder" more rewarding than "build a bunch of catapults." Also, it's pretty funny.\n\nThere are a few problems; the art for the cutscenes is pretty bad (although the pixel art in battle is pretty charming.) Some of the humor falls flat or, more often, breaks character. And adding the pointless subtitle didn't make the name any less generic. Still, it's overall a fun and addicting experience.","December 21, 2013","true","21.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That was not the case with Defender's Quest. I've found myself unknowingly playing for hours. As with all TD games, you raise your heroes, while managing your resources. After battle, you gain EXP which levels your heroes up and scrap (gold) to buy equipment to make them even stronger.\n\nYou can easily choose to play with an army (up to 6 of each hero) or you can play with only the main hero from each class for an extra challenge. For those who dislike grinding for exp and gold, you will be pleased to know they have included an option to boost the exp and gold gain by 300%.\n\nI highly suggest this game if you enjoy TD games.","December 20, 2013","true","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

BUT you never know...there's always the possibility of "the game" that opens you up to a genre...\nTo summarize, it's an awesome game.

It gets old way to fast and I get sick of it after a few hours, no matter the great story or character developement I never came back to those games. It was more of a pain and tedious grinding than fun and epic adventure.\n\n"Defender's Quest" however kept me in my seat. It's basically an RPG mixed with tower defense, the best of both worlds if you ask me. I like everyone else play tower defense games because of it's gameplay, which is why this game is great. I took out the part that I hate in RPGs and replaced it with one of the most replayable gametypes that there is, which makes me wonder why no one have come up with this earlier.\n\nIt seems that alot of games are jumping on the "Mix RPG with other genres" train which really makes me happy to see. This game is great from what I've seen so far and great for anyone who have always wanted to get into RPGs but been scared of due to the grindy and difficult gameplay. I have played "Final Fantasy XIII" and didn't know what the heck I was doing 15 hours into the game, it felt like a fancy pokemon without the fun. I'm currently only 6 hours in and feel comfortable already,\n\nYes this game is hard and you will have to grind to get the best gear. However, each level has a difficulty setting like any mobile game, making it really easy if you want to speed through the story, still providing a challenge and bonuses for those willing to get them.\n\nI am currently only 6 hours in I cant wait to play more, I'm just hoping the game is as lengthy as an actual RPG, which if it isn't might be off putting. And it's worth noting that I only stopped played due to a game crash, it is the first time it has happened so I cannot say if it i a regular.\n\nEither way I do sincerely recommend this game, it is currently on sale, definitely worth it for the price tag, grab it now to save some cash.","January 26, 2014","true","15.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is a ton of depth with characters having their own skill trees, each defensive unit becoming special in their own way. It has good areas to level up quickly if you want to power up, but it doesn't feel necessary. In fact, the game has a good pace, and you could pick it up and play just a few minutes, or a few hours! The ability to slow down, pause, or speed up combat is so pleasing to have also, allowing me to follow a flow I'm comfortable with, never too pressured, but always leaving you thinking. I highly recommend it for the price, and tower defense lover would enjoy this, and even those new or not keen on the genre will feel comfortable with it. I know I was!","January 26, 2014","true","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While you boost the characters in battle, there also is a leveling up system in which you also add points to certain skills which actually adds a lot of depth to the game - it makes you think about what is mostly valuable of each defender and if you boost them enough for a certain skill to be used.\n\nSome enemies go straight for Azra, some try to get Azra but attack defenders along the way, some are fast, some are slow, some have armor, some have an insane amount of hit points. The come in waves from different locations in different amounts.\n\nIt all sounds pretty basic, right?\n\nWhat makes this game so special is that it introduces new variables and level designs at just the right pace; there is never too much of one thing in the game, it's never a grind, it's never repetitious. The levels were never frustrating when they were heard either; it always just made me think hard about a better defense, who should get boosted and where I need to reposition during the battle. The idea of making something challenging without making frustrating is something they absolutely nailed on this game. On the flipside, if you are convinced you have everything figured out for your defense and even need to watch - just fast foward with the 2x or 4x button (this small feature is amazing).\n\nIf you want to go back and play the battles at a high difficulty, you can do that too, which I also found the be very fun (the higher difficulty didn't just add more enemies - it also changed what types of enemies and even changes the entry points. Once again, they did a great job of preventing this game from feeling like repetitious).\n\nThe game has an accompanying story which is kind of funny sometimes. I enjoyed the animations mostly and they were well done. A minor complaint of mine would be that the humor bits would take over the unfolding of the story occasionally and got in the way. I don't feel like the story development was conitinuous enough.\n\nThe music was pretty enjoyable and fitting for the game. I will say some of the songs seemed like they were ripped from Nobuo Uematsu (Final Fantasy I - X, Chrono Trigger) but he is the GOAT.\n\nHighly recommended.\n","December 7, 2015","true","55.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Great, and actually horrifying story, despite the cartoony cutscenes and pixelated gameplay, but also filled with wacky humour.\nYou can replay levels on harder difficulty for special unique weapons or extra exp or scrap (money) rewards, and once you finish your first playthrough, you can play a new game plus with a twist: you get extra (difficult) sidequests which sometimes are just extra rewards, but others thoroughly expand the story.\nAll in all, good gameplay, great music, hilarious but also serious and tragic characters and story. Definitely worth the smal price.","December 16, 2012","true","28.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Instead of placing towers, you're placing party members. Like a traditional TD game, there are resource points you acquire within a round that you can spend on placing new towers (i.e. allies) or buffing the towers you've already placed. In Defender's Quest, this resource is called "PSI", which is essentially the "mana" of Azra (aka: you, the commander).  Howevever, Defender's Quest also gives you two other resources to spend BETWEEN rounds: gold and experience.\n\nExperience is used to unlock abilities on an ally's skill tree, thereby making them available to use in battle. (Each skill is assigned a power level and is not available in battle until you buff this ally to that level using PSI points.)\n\nGold is used to hire new allies into the party or to purchase armor/weapon upgrades for individual allies, which immediately and permanently boosts their stats (i.e. unlike skill upgrades, these are conferred immediately at the start of battle---no PSI points required.)\n\nEvery level can be replayed as many times as you want to farm XP and gold, and every level has multiple difficulty settings that earn you better gold/XP rewards for beating them. (There is no penalty for running away.) Beating the highest difficulty on some levels earns you a legendary weapon or armor, far more powerful than anything you'll find in shops.\n\nThe only bad thing I could possibly say about the game is that the art in the cutscenes makes the game's aesthetic somewhat comparable to something you'd find on a flash portal. By flash portal standards, the artwork is amazing. By overall industry standards, the art seems a little amateur. The in-game art is pixely and SNES-tastic. I criticize only the cutscene art here. But in the end, it doesn't even really matter, because the cutscenes have no effect on gameplay, and you can even skip over them all if you like. The game itself is A+.\n\nIf you like Tower Defense, it's one of the better TD games in the Steam catalogue.","March 12, 2014","true","13.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

No real challenge... or even tower defense.\n\nWhere most tower defense makes you think about how best to place towers and what to upgrade when, this game is completely stripped of thought. You learn the optimal locations for each "tower" type early on, and, as evidenced by "hero mode", the levels are almost all designed with a choke or two that takes full advantage of a single group's optimal patterns, so most levels play like this:\n\n1. Plug one, rarely two, "tower" groups into obvious optimal sockets locations\nOPTIONAL: Spam archers\n2. Upgrade (Mostly whenever, you'll have plenty of 'power'.)\n3. WIN\n\nThe "RPG" side certainly gives math nerds something to obssess over, but it's similarly simplistic:\n\n1. Level up!\n2. Damage +1\nOPTIONAL: Reset points at any time, because you somehow screwed that up\n\nThat's it. You want your healers to heal, of course, (skip Holy Light completely) and to take advantage of each "tower's" secondary effects, (armor break, chill, bleed, range, light/blind, devour) but for the most part, you'll just have to decide which usually low-end skill or two to neglect. Usually the lowest. You can safely ignore most defensive skills. (The actual numbers are utterly pointless because adequate info to calculate DPS and some secondary interactions aren't provided, and you learn how effective everything is by "feel"/sight same as any TD game anyways... but don't tell the math nerds!)\n\nAnd that's the game for you. The art is bland, the story is absurd, but occaisionally amusing. Nothing to see here. While not a "worst game ever", if you're out for an actually good tower defense/game, look elsewhere. You might enjoy this if you're a math nerd, part of the Number Enlargement crowd, or just want something easy and amusing to click on and only plan to throw a few hours away with it anyways. Don't expect the game to get better as it goes on, it just doesn't. It never could, because it's fundamentally flawed.\n\nUnfortunately, I have to add: system requirements are a trollishly bad joke. The game runs in Flash/AIR and suffers from the usual "looks like an old DOS machine could run it/practically requires a super-computer" issues. If you don't have a video card that accelerates Flash, it will take almost twice as long to get the same amount done as with, and you will lose input control if you button-mash the one spell you'll want to button mash. But don't worry, you'll only notice it at critical moments, and only cause you to lose your "perfect" completion on a couple 45 minute boss battles... before you learn. Or your RSI flares up.","October 11, 2014","false","88.5"," 40 of 84 people (48%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","48","40","84","4","0"

I picked this game up on sale. At 15 dollars, no, this game is not worth it at all.\n\nThis is a simple tower defense game which only occupies a few screens across the entire game. Really isn't much to it. Feels like you are playing in a room or two.\n\nThe game is woefully unbalanced. For 90% of the game you can breeze by with only using Archers playing each level on it's hardest difficulty. This also means beating the game and then playing in game in it's second quest, which is just a repea of the game but harder. Problem is, the game is mostly a cakewalk until the end of the second quest where you hit this wall. And that is where the main problem is....\n\nGrinding. FOr some odd reason this game has you grinding. This game takes Tower Defense and ads the worst element from an MMO - Grinding. Now, to beat the game I have to grind the same maps over and over and over, jsut to beat the final few levels.\n\nOverall, did you find this while it had a 5 dollar price tag like I did? Buy it. It's fun up until the grinding hits. Did you find this game as it's full, overblown 15 dollar price tag?

About an hour into the game the difficilty ramps up so much that you are forced to go back and play levels you've already finished and play them repeatedly to grind enough xp and money to upgrade enough to be able to finish the new levels.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nifboy/recommended/218410/","nifboy","nifboy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nifboy/","349 products in account","Defender's Quest is a case study in covering your weaknesses and emphasizing your strengths. Shoddy writing? A beautiful "skip" button in every cutscene and dialogue can be turned off. Difficulty? If you hit a brick wall in story mode you can go back and do slightly harder versions of prior maps to level up. Tower diversity? Unique equipment means your second Berserker probably won't be as good as your first, so it's harder to spam one tower. The slog of New Game+ not going fast enough? Triple experience is an option in the menus. All this lets you focus on the core tower defense game, which is best played at 4X speed.\n\nPlenty of weaknesses can't be worked around, though. Workshop mods are few in number, and the first one I tried locked up the game in the first level. Character level is too huge a factor in whether you pass a level or not, meaning few maps feel appropriately scaled to your level at any given time. The game has a fixed resolution, even in fullscreen, and in fullscreen Steam notifications will leave artifacts on the screen. It's a little too easy to fall into a "two of each" mentality, setting up two identical sets of towers on the two major paths of most maps, with the only major variance between maps being what towers you level up first. The tower "skill trees" don't contribute much especially for those towers that only have variants of "melee attack" or "shoot arrows".\n\nFor all the weaknesses I've pointed out, there are few high points in the game. The boss fights are excellent, requiring you to balance "kill the boss faster" against "kill the creeps faster". Otherwise it's the usual tower-defense game of setting up your towers and watching them slaughter thousands of zombies. The game demands enough of your attention in boosting your towers etcetera that it's not a good "put something on in the background while you play" game, but isn't demanding enough to be a thoughtful or engaging experience.\n\nAll in all, it's hard to recommend Defender's Quest unless you're just dying for a tower defense game where you make a bunch of bars go up a la Progress Quest.","September 26, 2014","false","10.3"," 24 of 55 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","24","55","0","0"

That means no random encounters, no spikey-haired emo kids, no forced time sinks, and no tedious, repetitive battles.\n\nThe battle system builds off of tower defense, with individual characters taking the place of towers. Each character levels-up, learns skills, and equips gear individually, allowing the player to customize their battle experience and strategy. The overall game structure is similar to "tactical" RPG's, but with a real-time battle system. Game speed is adjustable, and commands can even be issued while the game is paused.\n\nIt also features an engaging, character-driven story written by an actual English major! The story strives to be fast-paced, snappy, and always relevant to gameplay. Events and dialogue explain things as they become relevant to the player, minimizing exposition.\n\nFinally, it's got options and accessibility settings out the wazoo, so that you can have the best possible experience!","January 25, 2014","true","405.3"," 15 of 37 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","15","37","0","0"

Combat is fun, but there's no depth to it. Once you get gear and the basics, you snowball from half way onward, plowing through everything near-effortlessly. The game also suffers bizarre frame drops. Seeing that this game's graphics are 16+ bit, it's inexcusable to have to compensate for input lag on such an undemanding game.

Only a few gripes make this game short of perfect.\n\nLong: "Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten" is a Tower Defense game in which you fight hordes of enemies by using different classes and spells. The classes (of which there are 6) all differ in playstyle and give the game its RPG elements via XP gains, talent trees and weapon/armor aquisition. Even though the game looks simple, it offers a very deep combat and leveling system which will have to be adjusted multiple times in order to beat certain levels. Examples include making your archers target fastest enemies first, putting the stun sword in the hands of your knight, or making sure your ice skills don't get cancelled by your burn ones.  The story itself is amusing as well and gave me a few chuckles along the way. New Game+, 3 star rating per level, and challenges such as endless mode only extend the life of this game and make you want to play more.\n\nThere are however, a few issues. Some, like the "Undo" button, which removes ALL the points you just put into your character's skill tree instead of just the last one, should be renamed "Restart" because that's what it actually does. This gets very annoying when respeccing a character with 60 points in New Game+. However, the "Undo" button is not game breaking so it doesn't change my rating of the game. What does, however, is the terrible frame drop encountered during big fights. Even though I have a very powerful rig, it has caused the game to crash several times (once while on 95th wave of endless when attempting 100 wave achievement!). Another is the poor visual of the cursor, which when coupled with the fact the frame rates drop, makes it impossible to see. This has caused me to lose a few games or constantly pause to execute commands.\n\nBut the few imperfections get dwarfed by the fact this is a great game, and had me coming back for that "JUST ONE MORE ROUND" feel. The devs are actually pretty cool/active as well and respond quite frequently in the forums. Don't miss this game, it is very much worth it!

But I do love tower defense, and it runs on linux, so I went ahead with the purchase. Very impressed, this game is actually very excellent and has an old-school SNES feel with modern tower defense. I've been playing it over more publicly accredited games (it actually has pulled me away from DOTA 2), so decided that a positive review would help out a bit because I feel very strongly about how this hidden gem wasted an entire Sunday for me, and I'm still not done beating it 100%. I rarely care about beating games 100%, I think the last time I did it was for a little-known title called Goldeneye in the 90's.\n\n\nExcellent concept: merges RPG with tower defense. That's all there is to say, really. Units seem to be all useful, but as with ANY old-school RPG combat it can get super easy or impossible depending on whether or not you grind. Regardless on that, there are technically four difficulties (if you count casual) that change each battle's difficulty hugely. Story is alright -- the humor isn't my cup of tea, but then again, I have a picture of the dude from The Human Centipede 2 as my steam picture, so I just gotta say it's a me thing.\n\nLooks like they're making a sequel. Good, I'll be sure to buy it.\n\n\n\nIf you're on linux and can't figure out why the game doesn't start without an error message, you need Adobe AIR. Their website is quite good on showing you how to get it running. A minor setback, I'm sure with licensing reasons Steam can't install it as a dependency. However, it almost made me assume the game was poorly ported and bugged (like Dead Island which doesn't boot on linux for some and nobody knows why, LOL).\n\nThe devs obviously cared a lot about this game: it's not junk meant to be sold to chumps where they buy it on sale, play for 15 minutes, then never open it up again. The writing is good -- not perfect, but meant to be (ugh) all ages. It's not a super deep story, though I feel with more practice they could pull it off if they feel it wouldn't detract from the gameplay in the sequel.\n\nI would advise the devs to look at their website and tone down on the humor -- had my bored, cynical ♥♥♥ seen it without playing the game I would've assumed this game would be ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe art isn't AAA title, but as an indie game, what the ♥♥♥♥ do you expect? The battles are mid 90's SNES quality (though better than Breath of Fire II, worse than FF6) and the cutscenes are adobe flash-esque and very similar to the indie game Sequence (minus the voice acting, plus more character gestures).\n\nIf the game was a teensy little longer and made for the SNES, with a little more "professionalism" mixed in, it would've been a classic everyone would've known about.\n\nI came in expecting ♥♥♥♥ and found a gem I hadn't heard about before. I'm old, drunk, and cranky, and this stole an entire day from me and perhaps longer. Def buy @ $10, even $15. It's about on par with binding of isaac.","November 2, 2014","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is small in file size, but big in play! I like that I can easily run it in the background while I do other things on the computer.\n\nThe story progresses nicely. The characters are engaging, and I was never bored with the plot. You can complete the entire plot in a day even if you take your time. The graphics are in pixel style for the gameplay. The cut-scenes were artwork with text underneath. The art would move in response to the text moving, like reading an illustrated book.\n\nThis game has nice replay value. Every site on the map has 3 levels, easy, normal, and advanced. To unlock everything, you must beat all three. There are a lot of achievements in this game, and some of them are quite difficult to get. A single level can be solved in many different ways. And, the whole game can be played in newgame+ mode, which makes beating it a second time a new challenge.\n\nOnce I finished the plot, I found that I don't like to play for hours on end.

You can't do any forced pathing or anything like in defense grid but you still want to place your units so that they are getting in as many hits as possible. You can also set units to specific targeting types, whether it's whatever enemy is closest to the end of the trail, the one with highest HP, lowest HP, etc...\n\nAll in all this is a good little TD, I wouldn't recommend buying it unless it's on sale for like 5-8 bucks though.","August 7, 2014","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I liked it; overall, it's a quaint little game.  The characters are likable and the story (although not too original) is well paced and engaging enough.  There were a few times where the gameplay felt a little grindy to me (make sure you level up more than one priest, for example - I didn't and had to grind one up before I could proceed) but you can redo levels on harder difficulties for more experience and money or on easier difficulties to move the game along.\n\nEventually, I just started playing on easy to advance the story along, then I just quit playing altogether.  Although I didn't finish it I still liked the game and would recommend it to fans of TDs, especially if the added RPG elements interest you.\n\nI also liked how it asked you to like the author on Facebook or something to get a free item at the beginning.  I always give games that ask me to do this a resounding, "Hell No!" and when I did with Defender's Quest it gave me the items anyway, so I thought that was nice.\n\nNothing to write home about, but it wasn't a bad attempt.

On the surface it looks pretty mediocre but there is alot of fun to be had in Defender's Quest.\n\nThe tower defense aspect of this game is pretty unique if you havent played classic Warcraft 3 "Mauls" for example, you summon units to the field and can upgrade them with mana you gain from killing enemies. the kicker is these units are unique, you recruit them throughout the game and as you progress, they gain levels, skills, and equipment.\n\nThe character you play as (Azra) is even equippable with spellbooks, and levels like the others. in this case however you level spells that are castable anywhere on the field for mana, much like Sol Survivors abilities.\n\nEach win you make gives you a multitude of currencies that are usable in the overworld, scrap (for items), Stars (for challenges and spellbooks), Skulls (for something I havent found yet), and sometimes unique items to equip your retinue with.\n\nThe story is pretty blasé, but it does the job of driving you forwards at least. Overall a very enjoyable game with a excellent blend of mechanics that work harmoniously and result in a plethora of entertainment.\n\nTwo thumbs up!","July 2, 2013","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can have up to 6 of each type of tower.  RPG elements mostly revolve around your towers leveling up in a persistant way.  In addition you buy things like weapons and armor for your towers.  Furthermore your main character levels up, who acts as the endpoint of a level, and the person you're trying to protect with your towers.\nIt has the same fallbacks as other TD games, monotony being the main one.  You have to grind out levels and money to make yourself more powerful, but the game has an awesome options menu that gives you the option to speed up exp gain for units in and out of combat, as well as speeding up monetary gain, all without flagging yourself as a cheater, or denying yourself awards.

All the gear customization reminds me of Fantasy Defense on Android which I was a big fan of as well.\n\nThis game is defintely a gem that people should look into buying.\n\nI am so stoked for Defender's Quest 2","October 21, 2014","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Is it the best ever? Probably not.  It is a tower defense with set paths on every map, no path customizing (altering) at all which i would say is a strategic element required for it to be the best ever.  But it does have an actual story which makes sense of enemies getting to the goal point, never seen that in a TD game. Story is ok, some good humor, skill trees for units who gain persistent levels, over 10 hours of gameplay on initial game mode (far more if you want to unlock everything), and after beating it it unlocks a different and harder game mode.  All these things combined give this game far more depth and play time then any TD game I've played and I've played quite a few. It could be made better and I am hoping for a sequel.

Each "tower" is a character and levels, equips and spends skill points independently. The campaign has a nice length to it. I'm not finished, but I'm over 20 battles. Each battle also has multiple difficulties that give greater rewards, including unlocking bonus missions.\n\nThe native resolution is tiny, probably 800x600 if not 640x480 and there is no way to increase it in windowed mode that I can see. Also the generic characters you make have the potential to be clones of your main heroes, each class' talent tree provides customization but (at least at low levels) leaves little advantage to stray. It would be nice if each character could learn different active skills from their brethren that share a class.\n\nThere is a sequel in the works and I look forward to it. It would appear they are addressing my main issues and thensome.\n\nBottom line, I'm enjoying this title and while I'm a sale hound, if I had paid full-price I wouldn't have been disappointed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/schlagwerk/recommended/218410/","schlagwerk","Paparazzi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/schlagwerk/","211 products in account","I always had a certain fondness for tower defense. In StarCraft, I'd spend more time stacking cannons than playing the ladder, and Team Fortress 2's MvM mode reveals a certain primal fun of killing tons of heartless, unfeeling dudes. To that end, Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten presents a well-rounded, core dude-killing experience, but the cracks in the polish are evident.\n\nYou're given six classes to play, all fairly standard for the genre: heavy damage, light damage, healer, ranged, status effects, and tank. Upgrade trees for each class are fleshed out for the game's length, and most powers are distinct from the moment you first receive them. Leveling up your characters before and during battle using "Psi" adds a certain urgency to the fight, and doesn't feel forced.\n\nBut between battles there exists some friction between the player and the imperfect interface. Between the fast-forward of battle and the clunky number-comparison engine to power up your party, you'll be wishing for a patch to streamline or automate the process. You could do worse but you could do better; not even trendy not-loading-but-loading-messages like 'reticulating splines' or 'powering up the thermal core' are to be seen. You might hope to find some solace in the story, but it's just as hacked-on as the interface and I couldn't be bothered to follow it.\n\nMy first playthrough entailed of spamming rangers (long-range) with the range upgrade and blew through the game without breaking a sweat, but in Hero Mode, where you limit yourself to one of each class, is where the game's difficulty felt most appropriate. Oftentimes you'll have three or four spawn points to deal with, and you'll need to consider the most optimal placement to cover all your bases, evoking the puzzle modes of yore.\n\nAll in all I'm giving this a weak recommendation. The game itself is pretty solid - gameplay is mostly balanced, and it can be as hard as you want it to be. The lore isn't engaging and you won't miss much from skipping it; on the other hand, if you're the type for a story maybe tower defense wasn't going to be your cup of tea anyway. If it goes on sale again for 90% off you'll get a fun one-off to pick up and play, not unlike something you'd find on a phone or tablet. Otherwise, you may feel you aren't getting enough bang for your buck.","February 14, 2014","true","31.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As with any tower defense game, your goal is to prevent enemy units from reaching your tower. In this case, your tower is a librarian who has obtained magical powers to battle in the realm between life and death. To defend herself, she can cast some magic spells and she can pull her allies (berserkers, archers, healers, knights, ice mages, and dragons) into her realm and position them for defense. Besides the librarian, all units act on their own once placed. The defenders' skills and the librarian's spells can all be leveled up by earning experience. The skill trees, along with armor and weapons, provide the ability to customize each defender's strengths.\n\nWhat makes the game addictive is the variation. Each battle provides a different set of enemies and a different map with sometimes challenging unit placement options. As the game progresses, the type, number, and skill of available defenders increases which provides for different strategies to be employed. Each battle can also be completed at one of four difficulty levels, with higher levels producing different, more powerful, more numerous enemies. Completing battles perfectly (with no tower damage) unlocks bonus levels for additional variation. Once the main story is completed (10 - 20 hours depending on replays, bonus levels, etc.), a "Play+" option allows the story to be run again, this time with additional side quests, newly-enhanced enemies, upgraded weapons/armor, etc. The librarian's journal is also unlocked, adding some more humor to the game (which was already very light hearted in tone).","February 3, 2014","true","147.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Turns out that was a pretty damn sweet deal. Defender's Quest isn't overly complex, innovative, super-artistic or genre-defining. What it is, though, is easy to get into, sort of addicitve, and a lot of fun.\n\nHonestly, the core mechanics are pretty simple - you have six character classes, each with slight customizability (basically skill trees and pallete swapping consist of the variations in-class), and each serve their own purpose. The challenges definitely lend themselves to exploiting this variation - you WILL not beat this game using just your archers, for example. The key strategical elements will be where along the paths you place your characters, how you choose to boost them during battle, and how to time the protagonist's abilities (a feature which helps engage a player and prevents one from just sitting back and watching the level unfold). Add in a mild RPG-twist with how you choose to level up skill sets, and you have a very simple concept turned into something that has multiple layers of combat. Good move on their part.\n\nThe story, while simple, is sufficient enough to make you want to keep going. Characters are all pretty eccentric for the most part, and the humor is just average. I'm okay with that, though, as when I bought a game that looked like it could be run on a flash-based website, I really expected a cliche-ridden excuse plot with bland characters. Kudos to the creators on that front.\n\nThe real downside of the game comes in the form of some rather noticeable forced level-grinding. The advanced and extreme challenges often change the way you play a level, but the general root of how you play it is still going to be there. Most average players (see: me) will have to repeat a level one or two times before confidently progressing on to the next challenge. This is extremely obvious in the otherwise-enteretaining new game+ as the enemy traits mean you have to work waaaay harder to beat the level.\n\nOther than that though, this is a straight-forward game with a lot upside. I certainly wouldn't be disappointed if I'd dropped the regular price on it. Try it out.","February 22, 2014","true","82.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
