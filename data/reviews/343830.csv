You WILL die......A lot! If you are familiar with Macventure games(and enjoyed ANY of them), then pick up this game! If you however have never played a Macventure game, or are easily angered/frustrated by games, then I would advise you to steer clear of this title(As well as all other Macventure games) until you have done some research.","February 13, 2015","true","1.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Found myself laughing and laughing each time I did something stupid and random. I still remember playing the originals and brings back memories even in real life where I made similar choices.
