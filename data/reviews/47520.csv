Locations are never reused, the characters are interesting, and the story is actually engaging. The story is also all over the place, with a talking stuffed bear, portals that open between our world and The Otherside, and a kidnapped little girl. Although the story makes little coherent sense, it's well done for this sort of casual fare, even if some of the puzzles get repeated towards the end of the game.","July 19, 2013","true","4.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","6"

There is also a bear that is suppose to be helpful and at times is funny but other times just annoying and seems to lead you away from the plot of story line.","June 21, 2014","true","4.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you like these casual hidden-object games, you'll probably like this one too. The game took around three hours to finish.","March 25, 2014","true","3.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you enjoy FB games such as Gardens of Time, you will undoubtedly like The Otherside. The narrative is a little strange, but there are several different puzzle types to keep the gameplay interesting.  The Otherside doesn't try to break the mold too much however and is a good choice for the casual gamer.  The Otherside is definitely a great pick for anyone who has a penchant for puzzles.","March 20, 2012","true","4.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
