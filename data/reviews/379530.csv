"http://steamcommunity.com/id/s3raphym/recommended/379530/","s3raphym","s3raphym","http://steamcommunity.com/id/s3raphym/","1892 products in account","Fate Tectonics is a difficult game to describe. Its core mechanic is a one-more-click world-building race against the clock, that could be compared to Carcassonne. An initial 5 minute "doom" countdown ticks toward an inevitable end-of-the-world, and what you've created is yours to destroy with a SimCity-esque disaster toolbar. After a few play sessions, you've gotten the hang of the core mechanics, and a minature progression system grants you permant additions to the clock based on in-game achievements. Quickly, that 5 minute countdown becomes an hour.\n\nOnce play sessions become longer, the scope of the mechanics becomes larger to match, forcing you to shift your focus being puzzle oriented to a holistic strategy. You find yourself balancing the whims of the Fates, and ultimately terraforming your world with newfound powers to survive an apocalypse.\n\nIt's simple, deep, challenging, addictive, and frustrating as hell.\n\nWatching my progress dissolve at 1am as Hogweed threw another tantrum, I heaved a heavy sigh, aggravated at Hogweed for not understanding that it was Pester's fault that all his precious trees turned had to dust. I hovered my mouse over quit.\n\n"What the hell. One more time."\n\nIt's the kind of game that you'll always be happy to give one more go in the chance that this time you might get it right, and for that, I can say Fate Tectonics is truly something special.\n\nISSUES AND LIMITATIONS;\n\nPlaying during the beta, I encountered a fair number of bugs and glitches, but the developer responded to my showstoppers with a new build within 48 hours without fail. That having been said, here's the issues that I've encountered that you'll want to watch the patch notes for if they apply to you. (These are on me as I haven't reported them as issues to the devs yet)\n\n1. If you encounter an obtuse error about the "manifest" file, update your copy of Adobe air.\n2. Plan to play with a mouse. Gamepad support is closer to mouse emulation rather than a first-class support, and the deadzone seems to be off for my xbox 360 controller.\n3. Plan to pay with a monitor (not on your TV). If you have a custom resolution to compensate for an overscan/underscan on your tv, it doesn't appear to support your desktop resolution. As a result, for me there's UI elements with cut-off.\n","September 9, 2015","true","9.4"," 59 of 60 people (98%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","98","59","60","3","0"

The whole idea was to sit and build up as perfectly as you can only to watch your work destroyed. This game works similar to that.\n\nThere are various "fates" that have temples, you place these temples on the map to spawn tiles around them, then each temple gives you access to 3 powers that you unlock by building more tiles of that fates type. As your world gets bigger you unlock more fates who give you more powers and more temples.\n\nThe tiles themselves are random and you must place them so that each side touches a land/element of the same type when placed. As you place tiles further out they start to weaken, think of it like legos being built off a table, the further you go the more likely they are to break off and fall. However you can use powers or build larger blocks of solid land to strengthen these areas so that you can expand out further and further. A skinny strip of land sticking off to the side would break off more easily than a solid piece of land, for example. You can visually see this thanks to the cracks that start to form near the weak points of your planet. You can also use fate powers such as placing cities on land to help strengthen the areas.\n\nThe problem is each fate has things they like and don't like, and if they get angry enough they'll eventually unleash their unique power on your planet in anger.\n\nSo how does all this play out? Well basically you sit around building up a lovely pixle world using these fates and their powers while trying to strike a balance that will keep them happy enough not to trash it. See how big and beautiful you can make your world before that happens.\n\nThere are two gameplay modes, timed and free mode. In free mode there is no time limit and your only worry is the anger of the fates on your planet, in timed mode you spend your time building up your planet and then once the time limit for each "Age" runs out you get to use various powers to destroy the planet you just built.\n\nHowever you'll also be unlocking achievements for pulling off certain tasks, and these achievements will bank you extra time in the next "Age" so that you'll get to spend more time building before you have to destroy what you built.\n\nOverall it's a beautiful puzzle game of balance, strategy, creation, and destruction. There are some issues with clarity as to why certain things happen due to lack of explaination but beyond that I enjoy the game very much and recommend it.","September 9, 2015","true","6.2"," 37 of 39 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","37","39","2","0"

Something about endlessly placing the tiles is soothing. I don't find that any of the Fates seem to get particularly angry or destructive even when I flat out ignore them to focus on just the fish guy, but I've come to believe that maybe the game is better off without being particularly tense or challenging. The Serenity mode is probably even more laid-back.\n\nIf you like making a pretty world that you can get strangely attached to, I'd say go for it! Lots of interesting little achievements to hunt down as well.\n\nHaving gotten a solid 7+ hours out of this game, I'm satisfied.","September 14, 2015","true","9.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It has a good art style and a creative match the tile concept. I might even be convinced that somewhere in here there is a great game waiting to be uncovered.\n\nUnfortunately, the experience I had with it was poor right out of the gate. In enabling the full screen option, I had the game not resize and then crash. The initial menu is not intuitive, so much so that I did not realize I had started the first mission until the NPC god character started moving around. At this point I was ready to accept this game as an unpolished gem, ready to accept that I just didn't "get it" yet.\n\nI enjoyed the first level enough. Matching the tiles and watching your cities come together had a good feel to it. The hint for the boat tile never popped up, so not sure exactly what that did, but I floated a few boats as well.\n\nThen the doom timer for level one hit. I was ready for the angry Fate (god) to wreck shop on my poor villages. Except now I was the god with a toolbar of options that were not explained. Ok, no worries, I'll just click them all. Destruction rained down, it looked cool enough, but there wasn't any sense to what I was doing because it wasn't explained. I'm fine with the (DARK SOULS tm) approach by which you don't baby sit and explain everything to the player, but there wasn't a lesson I was learning. There didn't seem to be any cost to each button, so why not rain the meteors down over installing industrial factories (wut?)?\n\nI was even fine enough to give this a pass. But there was, again, no clear method for moving forward. Was I supposed to restart level one but do better? Was I supposed to move on to level two? If so, how? In restarting level one, the entire world was shaking and would not stop. I have to assume and truly hope this is a bug, otherwise why was this decision made? I could no longer play due to getting a serious headache from watching the screen shake. Saving and reloading the game did not solve this.\nEDIT: After checking the forums this shaking was supposedly a bug that was fixed prior to me having installed and played the game. Clearly it was not solved entirely. The dev post saying it is fixed is from Sept. 12 and it is currently the 14th.\n\ntl;dr: The game doesn't give any sense of how to progress or play it. It's fine to not hold the player's hand, but this is just bad design. The game had numerous bugs causing it to crash. It crashed due to some interaction with OBS while trying to stream it. The worst bug had the game screen shaking constantly to the point it was unplayable. First steam refund ever and it makes me sad to have to do so.","September 14, 2015","false","0.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","1"

The super-fun retro design of the game adds to the feeling, of course!\n\nThere are a few little annoyances, such as the pointer being in the way of the tiles as I try to lay them as quickly as possible, but I’m not sure if that is intentionally there to add to the challenge. On the same note: those Fates sure do get in the way when I am trying my darnedest to appease them….which...hmmm… seems like a cheeky metaphor! :) I ran into some bugs earlier in the release, but the developers have shown themselves to be very responsive and interactive.\n\nAnyhow, there is something indescribably calming about watching fickle gods irrationally throw temper tantrums all over my hard work, and then helping them demolish what I’ve built and starting over again and again… I didn’t expect this to be therapeutic! Who knew, indeed?","November 30, 2015","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some bullet points...\n\n-Interesting roguelite conventions - building a world can take time and if you fail it the whole thing's gone. Plus there's an in-game time limit so you can't just endlessly work through a single world.\n-As of the time of this review, I find that the game has a problem in that some of the intricacies of the mechanics can be very opaque. This is because, as a realtime game, you may not have the time to study how a disaster unfolds - not only do they happen reasonably quickly, but you generally are trying to do things simultaneously to manage them, not simply studying them. it is of course reasonable for a trial-and-error game to involve trial-and-error situations; unless you try to game a save, however, it may potentially take you some time to figure out certain mechanics without this (again, I haven't tried to do this yet, but I probably will today.)\n-Endearing sprite art; that sounds like a basic commendation for indie games, but the art really is quite charming and well-done.\n-The dev team is committed to rolling out updates over time, including attempting to address gameplay issues as well as bugs/et cetera. The price point may seem pretty hefty but there is long-term support in mind here.\n\nOverall I recommend it. I generally play shooters and other action games; Fate Tectonics has been a very welcome change of pace, and enjoyable to explore.","September 23, 2015","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The powers are very well balanced, the gameplay has a rhythmic quality to it that can require a bit of tact. And it's equally fun to create the lands and try to soothe the Fates' against their tempers as it is to unleash the eventual armageddon. It's a game that's hard to put down, because after shattering the world, I want to begin it anew yet again! Very fun to collect the acheivements as well.","January 28","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After enjoying the ♥♥♥♥ outta the demo came home and bought the game. Worth every penny.   Starts off as a race against the clock, but as you earn more time you really see the mechanics of this game come to light. Trying to appease the gods, keep your world in balance, and add more pieces, it quickly becomes addicting.  Highly reccomend this game, and the developers are incredibly nice which is a bonus.  If you enjoy puzzle and strategy games, you will love this.","April 28","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each one has their own personality, preferences, and opinions on how you should build the world. If you continue to ignore a given Fate's preferences, they'll steadily grow angrier until they unleash natural disasters onto your world, potentially undoing all of your creations.\nOn top of this, you must also manage a special Fate who periodically triggers a doomsday event, destroying your entire world and starting you back from square one. You're graded after each doomsday and given additional time to work on your next world based on certain accomplishments / achievments, until you gather up enough time to unlock all of the Fates and "complete" your world before doomsday arrives.\nThe whole game is exceptionally charming and has a lot of personaity layered on top of some simple but enjoyable mechanics. It can be a little stressful jumping in, as the Fates require a lot of juggling, but it's overall a very silly and exciting experience that I am happy to recommend.","April 25","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
