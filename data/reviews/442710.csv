"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PlanetRock/recommended/442710/","PlanetRock","Conjah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PlanetRock/","198 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAs somebody who's played almost 120 hours in the 2 weeks leading up to the launch(including many more hours before I recieved a Steam key) ran the largest guild and single handedly helped out more people with information in hope they would stick around than anyone else, I'd like to think my review holds more weight than the rest. Having said that, I won't be recommending this game. I told the developers I would stick around and support them but now I sit here and think to myself, "Why?"\n\nMost, if not all of the positive reviews, are made by "regulars" (who've been around for no more than 3 days mind you) who are trying to achieve developer favouritism and I expect a barrage of response comments and downvotes of this review on here from them, defending the game and blowing smoke up your @ss with "How good the game is" or "How wrong I am". I've made the decision to leave so they can simply go and get f*cked because I'd rather give the Steam community the real truth on this title if you wish to accept it, saving you wasted hours of your time on a game that's been around for a year or more, which in my mind, doesn't even qualify for Early Access.\n\nThe game looks sweet and innocent on the outside, offering a 2D pixel MMO where you can quest, go on spammy grindy raids, create guilds and own your own player housing (I'd give you more positive points but sadly, that's all there is at the moment.) but in the few days leading up to the Steam launch, the cash shop was activated and the real intentions of the developers started to shine through. MICRO TRANSACTIONS.\n\nThe game is labeled Free to Play and it is by no means Pay to Win, but it surely is Pay to Play. There are many Pay to Play games disguised as F2P out there, I'm sure you've come into contact with them and this is certainly one of them. It's like the classic nightclub case of - "Oh it's free entry, but to have fun I need to pay money for drinks"\n\nKeep in mind, once you reach the max level of 40. (Which will only take you a week) There is absolutely nothing left to do in the game unless you kick over better spent money to the developers in order to keep yourself from leaving the game in utter bordem.\n\nWant extra inventory bags? As every single MMO I've played offers within their storyline through either questing or an in-game vendor? Too bad, you'll have to pay real money for them or subscribe for $10 a month to be able to access the quests that don't even exist yet to get them.\n\nOk so you want to run a guild or get involved in the player housing system? You get a few floors and walls in a little beginner package and some other floors and walls from the monotonous raids you eventually have to spam at end game to keep yourself entertained. Once you've built the shell for your home or guild house, it's time to put some furniture in! Oh conviniently there's no crafting recipies for furniture, but they're available in the cash shop for $5 EACH! 1 single piece of pixelised junk furniture is worth $5 apparently.. Not to mention selling a stove you can "cook on" as the description reads but there's not even a cooking system implemented or publicly planned to be implemented..\n\nIn the week leading up to Steam, there were more cash shop implementations than actual improvements/fixes or new content to the game, which in my mind is far more important when you've got such a shallow game like this. When it comes to implementing new things or fixing a bug, they bring in 1 thing and it breaks 5 or more other things, leaving them with a trail of cr@p to clean up before they can even concerntrate on bringing in some new content.\n\nThere's also crates and keys for this game, which seems to be the trend of titles who want to strip you of your money and get you hooked on a borderline gambling scheme, for example, CS:GO, Team Fortress etc. These crates or "chests" as they are in this game, offer "Heroic" items which can be found as common dropped loot, or they give you "better" items, which I've yet to even see and not even sure if they exist. After complaints from the regulars, they decided to make the keys have a chance of dropping as loot but i'm sure the drop rate is about as common as a Half Life 3 release this year. Of course there is an in-game currency which buys most of the cash shop items in game, conviniently it costs $5 for 450 "gems" and a key pack costs 500 gems. So you'll be spending $10 minumum for that. This may have changed now as I confronted the developers on this and their own words were "Yeah, we just rushed the prices, we may alter them, they're a little scumbaggy at the moment"\n\nYou might say to yourself, "I don't need all this stuff to play the game" but eventually you will or else you will run into utter bordem as I did and many players before me have. One of the main supporters and backers is some kid named "Casimyr" who ultimately abandonded the game untill it recieved more content or became popular through Steam, which doesn't even look like that's happened. So that shows you how boring it can get, even when you're the primary backer, wiki creator and apparently the most passionate player of the game.\n\nThe developers were streaming on Twitch as they worked on the game, drinking alcohol and telling stories about how one of them flys their dog around on aeroplanes that costs hundreds of dollers each time, but act like theres no money to go towards new implementations or staff untill they sucker money out of people at Steam launch. I remember somebody subscribing and a developer saying "Oh thanks, that money will go towards designing 1 sprite for a boss" lol. Please...\n\nOh and I almost forgot the terrible lag spikes and rubberbanding with a mere 20 people online (Their peak before they hit Steam). I graciously said it wasn't so bad and didn't effect my gameplay so much but they knew, along with everyone else, that the game wasn't going to be able to handle Steam launch and look what happened. They had to bring their servers down in a rush to try and fix them.\n\nSo in conclusion, don't waste 120 hours on this game like I did to find out there's little to no content available with a cash shop being shoved down your throat to keep you entertained. Maybe wait half a year to a year and see where this game is really headed. Even though it's a cute little 2D pixel MMO, it still needs to be treated like every other game when it comes to reviews and I truely believe the main reason the developers are so vocal with their playerbase is so they can schmooze each individual player into supporting them, ultimately handing them money for a project that quite frankly doesn't deserve it.\n\nIt's nothing more than an empty, shallow game with a pretty dress, trying to scam money off gullable gamers. People are quick to leave positive reviews after playing for an hour or two because they are oblivious to what awaits them.\n\nWell that's the impression I certainly got and I know a lot of players in-game agreed with me. Oh well, goodbye Fantasy Tales, it was kinda fun? while it lasted for a week.

First of all, it's a beta that literally came out a few weeks ago and there are people giving it thumbs down because of bugs. You know what I did when I found bugs? I went and reported them straight to an admin, who not only was incredibly kind but also took the liberty of actually taking his time to listen to me and report the bugs to developers. Now I could understand if you'd dislike a game where the devs ignore you and things dont get fixed but this is NOT one of those games. It's not even pay to win. It's not even much of a grind fest either, at level 1 you need 1,000xp to level up. Do you know how much xp you need to reach lvl 40? 2,550xp. Thats not a very big jump now is it. I've enjoyed every second of this game playing with my friends and running a 30+ member guild on the EU diamond shard. Yes at times it seems a little tedius, like gathering resources and quests not really linking to any 'main' story line, hell even the introduction to the game could have been beta (get it, I made a joke). But that doesn't matter, because some people seem to forget it's an incredibly early beta with updates literally every other day. Instead of judging a game when it's not finished, how about you wait... Untill then, if there's something you don't like then I suggest you talk to a dev about how to make it better. They will listen. Like good game developers do.\n\nFYI -  there are many bugs, but they will be fixed in due time, I promise!\n","May 19","true","74.1"," 47 of 53 people (89%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","89","47","53","9","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sokercap/recommended/442710/","sokercap","SokerCap","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sokercap/","307 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nUninspired autoattack grinder\n\nThe graphics are obviously simple. I don't count that as a con since you know that going in. However there is very little direction starting off. The combat is simplified to the point of absolute boredom, the enemies are as generic and repetitive as you could imagine, the world is not interesting there is no story, no lore to make you want to continue.\n\nCombat: click to start autoattacking. There are active skills you can level to put on your hot bar but only very limited ones that take a while before you can learn and from what I saw with the medic, very boring (hit for more damage, heal, shield etc). And that is literally it. That is all you will be doing\n\nThe enemies: first you kill beetles and spiders. And then you kill so many rats and bats and an occasional wolf that you will hate yourself. Of course by kill I mean click to autoattack and wait 10 seconds. They all are virtually identical just swapped sprites and names.\n\nThe dungeons: randomly generated sequences of exactly identical generic rooms with a few of the above mentioned enemies in each one. If every room feels exactly the same I'm not sure what the point of randomly generating them is, sometimes you turn left, sometimes you go straight, both ways you will wonder why you are wasting your time on this garbage.\n\nThe cash shop: wtf seriously. This game is lacking in so many areas, is "Early Access" and the part of it with the best functionality is the microtransactions. And oh boy do they love their microtransactions. Want that player housing they are advertising? Get your wallet. Want inventory space? Wallet. Want to do stuff at higher levels? .. Wallet. A game as simple as this and lacking in content and they want to charge you with so much cash shop items.. ridiculous.\n\nThere are so many better choices out there. Usually even trash games have at least one interesting mechanic they managed to add. I found none here.","May 6","false","1.2"," 52 of 76 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","52","76","0","0"

Luckily, more reviews are coming out that prove I'm not alone. Due to this, I'll go ahead and say my two cents.\n\nWhile I only have almost two hours in the game, I don't know if it's really...fun. The quests already felt like a chore after the initial one or two. Besides being a chore to find, at times it was difficult to actually find the quest giver, due to the poor minimap (although I may be missing on an option to zoom in, and that would be my fault instead).\n\nAs well, the grind is really boring for this game. Don't get me wrong, I love games that are literally grinding. Hell, I put in over a hundred hours in Warframe, and countless hours in ye' ol F2P MMORPGS where the only selling point was the 'grind'. The thing is, in this game the grind just feels (in simple terms) like something you'd rather set a bot up to do, than do yourself. I found myself more often than not trying to avoid having to kill enemies.\n\nThe clothing is also a little weird. The chest-piece and leggings show up your character, but the hat doesn't. For some reason, the devs decided that it would be better for you to be stuck with these weird stock heads (that range from some weird Naruto-looking head, a viking, some weird Avatar heads, and some generic recolors of other hairs), which show up no matter what helemt you're wearing, so it looks pretty silly when you run across the same guy with the same head as you, five times in just as many minutes.\n\nThe game doesn't seem bad, but it doesn't seem like anything more than a flash game ripped off of Newground's frontpage, and put on Steam.","May 6","false","1.8"," 31 of 45 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","31","45","0","1"

I love the simple and relaxing graphics, however it's gotten a bit boring.First of all theres only 3 classes with no mage type and all 3 classes get 1 offensiver ability at level 1 which will be pretty much you're only offensive ability for the rest of the game. The medic class (healer) only works as a healer and is terrible at soloing even though the game and all it's quest are meant to be soloed.  Theres a bunch of bugs for example weapons can have a bonus that gives % to it's base damage, but it doesn't work at all. The devs are more focused on fixing the cash shop than the actual gameplay.\n\nTo add to this after giving the game a little more play.\n\nLevel 35 Update - still killing zombies, skeletons, and rats.\n- All the quests are the same (clear this dungeon out which is full of zombies skeletons and rats).\n- The abilities are very poorly designed.

When I saw this on the list, I thought to myself: "Hell, I'll give it a shot."\n\nI downloaded the game from their  website, knowing it was Early Access an was likely to have bugs and problems.\n\nNow, I'm currently 40+ hours into the game and I've had an overwhelmingly positive experience thus far. The game runs well, with very few problems in regards to the client itself. The servers are quite stable, minus some slight problems they had early on after I started playing.\n\nThe community is very friendly and helpful, despite there being such a small playerbase pre-steam launch. There's almost always someone online that's willing to answer questions and help other players, which is wonderful.\n\nEven the development team is outstanding, keeping an active and open channel of communication between themselves and their playerbase. They monitor chat in game, answering questions and listening to suggestions, as well as on the forums. They reply to most, if not all threads that are posted.\n\nNot only that, but they're very transparent about what they're working on and extremely open to suggestions.

I love 2D games and you don't see this type of MMOs very often. It's very unique, I really enjoyed all the hours I spent into it. And I'm sure that the game will continue to amaze me.\n\nQuick review:\n+Amazing 2D graphics.\n+Combat is unique and fun.\n+Some dialogues and quests are really funny lol.\n+Community so far is very helpful and answers really quick if you have a question.\n+Quests which make exploration really valuable.\n+The game is helpful and really straight forward, got a radar and a map so you know where to head for quests if you don't know where to go.\n\n-Can be a bit laggy sometimes, I live in Europe and I'm on the EU server, I don't know what the issue could be. But it's not ruining the game experience for me.\n-Sometimes the monsters HUD (health bar) is not visible because of tree's or because your character is blocking it.\n\nNot much more to say, I really like this game and I will continue to update this review if it's needed. You must try it if you like 2D games like me. You can also add me if you want to play. Thanks for reading.","June 5","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It does have the retro top down feel as advertised. There is a good mix of grinding/quest/group related content with more on the horizon. Is it cutting edge? No. But it is a heck of a lot of fun and good to sit down with for a few hours at a time.\n\nThe team making the game is incredibly small. But they are by far putting their heart and soul into their product. They are often seen in game and always making tweaks and fixes where needed. Even for very early on, the game and servers have very little, almost non-existant down time.\n\nIf you're looking for a change of pace from the modern MMO, this game is for you. So far the small community is quite helpful and talkative, I'm looking forward to seeing what happens when the game grows.\n","May 5","true","27.3"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","0"

There are in fact micro transactions in the game but do not alter the gameplay in any way and do not put players ahead of the surve over others.\nThis game is a old school based 2.5D game where your whole objective is to make friends and complete quests as much as possible. This may sound boring and for some it is but for others this is their style of game. For a game like this the community is great and there is no way to sell items for others to buy unless you're at one of three islands shops. This is great because when in Runescape as most have played at some point there was a thing called the Grand Exchange that ruined the whole game trading system. People became distant and didnt reallly have to make friends with others. In this game you are forced to meet up with others to do hard dungeons and raids as well as to trade items that you need or will need in the future.\nThis game is honestly one of the best I've played in awhile and as of now I believe is a great game to play when you just want to catch up with random people. Servers are fairly low on people with as many as 80 people at one point which means chat logs arent being filled with spam. I myself am yet to see and actual toxic player on the game yelling in chat about how much they hate the game or how unfair it is.\nThe developers are also updating the game on a regular basis right now and hopefully it will continue so you can expect new quests every one to two weeks and they are constantly changing dungeons and adding new ones in to explore and fight. Also one MAJOR point of the dungeon system is they are COMPLETELY random everytime. This is a great function because if you know the exact route to use everytime people could do them in minutes but the random feature makes it so you have to spend your time actually exploring and fighting the monsters within them to get to then end.\nHopefully you read all of that and I know that some of it got repeated if not a lot of it, but the negative reviews on this game comes from people who log in an instantly dislike it because its not what they expected, it doesn't have a feature that they want but not implemented yet, or they see the shop and instantly assume its full of game changing micro transactions.\n\nThanks for checking out my personal review on the game\n-DuckJesus","May 7","true","21.4"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","48","10","21","6","1"

The game is free, so I would recommend anyone give it a try at the very least.\n\n\nFull Review\nAs of this review, I have played twenty minutes shy of two hours. It is important to understand I will not touch up on the game's community. Anyone reading this also needs to keep in mind that this is 'in early access'.\n\nI do recommend trying the game at the very least. It will cost you nothing and will take you all of 20 minutes to figure out if you like the game or not.\n\nThe biggest handicap in the game, for me, was the combat. There is no indication when combat begins/ends. No on-screen error prompts (for skills) if you have your chat window closed. Animations for attacks are next to non-existent. This can make it difficult to know if you are actually attacking back. On the other hand, however, you can interact with objects (quest objectives or crafting nodes) and defend yourself if you are attacked. Without stopping the progress/action you are currently involved in.\n\nCharacters... while there are some feminine hairstyles. Your character will maintain a male body and voice in the game. Not sure if this is due to lazy development/artists or some jab at a certain group. This will only be a problem for people who cannot get past what their character's look like without their clothes on. While wearing armor, it is pretty neutral looking. (Baggy/loose clothing.)\n\nLogging out throws you to the last bed you saved at. Has it's perks and it's pains.\n\nNow, I have not gotten far enough to find out if the developers CashShop block your progress in the game. A lot of it seems to be quality of life but not pay to progress. (larger bags and so forth.) I have no idea how much of character appearance customization is tied into the cash shop.\n\nInterface is interesting (unique) but a little clumsy. Quest windows will snap back to it's default position anytime it is refreshed. Tutorial window was in an unexpected place (upper right) and easy to miss. Especially since the quest info is on the other side of the window.","May 7","true","1.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Instead of focusing on glitches, I will try to bring more attention to the gameplay Pros and Cons.\n\nPros\n- Party system is simple.\n- You can peek into others' inventories.\n- Trade system is simple.\n- The free roaming is just the right amount.\n- The game is casual.\n- The Guild system is great.\nCons\n- The INN system (respawning at an INN when you log out) is annoying.\n- Player housing doesn't evict players who don't pay rent.\n- NPCs are repetetive.\n- Partying isn't ever actually necessary, and being in a party of just 2 creates a sense of being over powered.\n\nOverall, this game is for people who enjoy classic RPGs and casual team play. If you don't like those things, this game is not for you, so keep that in mind before flaming the devs. Also, this is early access. The glitches and bugs are not going to be around forever.

My issues reside with the core of the game which can't be changed without it being a whole new game. On the steam page this game promises complete customization and choices but you can't do that if you are locked in classes let alone having only 3 currently. Next I absolutely hate the animation system because of its super simplistic repetitive style and it's even missing basic animations such as diagonal movement. Now you might nag me saying but it's an early access but creating the diagonal movement is as easy as putting a dot on a graph in a blendspace which if it isn't in the game already it probably never will be. Another issue just because the game is free is the amount of trolls I met in gameplay. They range from spamming messages to inviting you to their party about 3 times every 10 seconds. Finally for my review the previous one was hated on because you can't review the game in less than an hour. For that I reply almost every single other review racked less time than I gave it a good review then quit playing. Also what reviews I saw on the day of release ,after 10 min of it being released some people had over 20 hrs. of gameplay and I hate to break it to you but those are by the people who worked on the game to get that time before release.\n(I will not respond to hate messages in my review because I would rather do more important things)","May 6","false","0.5"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","0"

And a few more classes to add more diversity.\n\nAll in all a geat game thats not pay to win that u can easily get hooked into and wanting another patch to roll around just too see what the dev team thow at us next.

Every action causes it. So at least wait for that to get fixed.\n\ni understand this is early access but even the basic systems are horribly clunky, you have to be right on the target to attack them/ use skills while they can hit you from 3 steps away.\n\nGot to level 21 before i lost all direction the main quest goes (last one i did was to do with something about fighting robbers in the graveyard), i am not up for trying to figure out where the next quest is. the only 'suitable' quests i have are apparently for my level but the monsters in the area are mean't for level 30+ characters","May 10","false","9.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

First of all, there are some glitches but this game is still in its early stages. Secondly, there has to be fishing and something to cook in, not just potions should be buffers. More bioms would be nice too. Also there should be some dyes for your armor. So far, this game gives you a lot of freedom and things to do but it throws a lot at you in the beginning.

So far it has provided me with more entertainment then 95% of the free to play games i've played in recent months. Early game is super important as it will encourage people to stay around past the first 5-20 minutes.\n\ni will say though medic dot (chemical waste) needs to be buffed substantialy or they should just take it away since it does almost nothing right now. The direct damage is fine on it.\n\nwith only 3 people working on this game i can't recomend anyone spending money on it yet as we've been burned too many times by steam greenlight games.\n\nBest feature in game: loot system. getting those rare items kinda like diablo 2 style. (i got a heroic purple item out of a crate at level 6 and its carrying the crap out of my medic right now.\n\nWorst feature: only a 3 class system with Assassin/Brute/Medic as the classes and no class advancement. No archer no mage yet. But they could put this in at a later date as its only early access.\n\nOverall so far i'd say about 7.5/10 on this game. it has a strong start and could be something really cool if they put in the time and make the correct choices in development.\n\nSince its free theres no reason not to try it.

These players were actually looking for favoritism and did not receive such since the game is not managed in such a way. I just want to make that clear because these posts just do not belong here and are full of misinformation.\n\nSo I have about 60 hrs total in this game and I must say I love it. Im currently a paying member and even though there's not tons of content at the moment it's coming. Fantasy tales offers a great passionate community and devs that listen and are passionate about creating a game that offers a  community driven nostalgic feeling missing from mmos today. The features currently implemented are as follows.\n\nIn game currently:\n-Diverse character building (any class can wear any armor so your build is your own)\n-creative hair and head changes\n-housing (yes you can custom build inside with tiles) outside to, and with trophies from bosses.\n-guild housing\n-crafting (so far just potions and limited furniture items)\n-raids\n-devs that listen to concerns and openly embrace community feedback.\n-unique and interesting quests that are well written and enjoyable.\n\nCurrently in the works\n-pvp (there's been talks about having open sea pvp in the future with boats).\n-more quests( slows down around level 30)\n-community involved housing events.\n-message board buy/sell system instead of an auction house. (Boards are already in)\n-endless progressive dungeon and this should be coming sooner then later.\n\nAll in all I highly suggest taking your time to try and support these guys theirs only 3 devs at the moment working their tales off and still making time for constant in game feedback. This is a game that deserves the support and there truly is nothing like it on the market today.","May 5","true","35.5"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","3","11","0","0"

It's obviously very early on, but this game actually plays GREAT. Controls are easy and work well. Combat is extremely simple but I think that's to be expected. You've got gathering, crafting, grouping, guilds, quests... this is very much all the "normal" stuff you'd expect from an MMO these days, but it's in a very nice retro package. The developers are active, responsive, and friendly.\n\nThe main problem right now is that the game is SUPER crowded, so the starting areas (especially the caves) have stacks of people competing for limited objectives.\n\nStill, this game has a lot of potential and is already a good few hours of fun (at least) in it's current state.","May 5","true","2.1"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

Since it is just starting it has only a few people around but if you bring a friend along it is qute fun. You dont really get to cusomize your character other than your gear (You can just change the head) but the graphics arent what makes this game good. Its free, it has only few bugs (from what i have experienced) and it is something you can enter while rec. for youtube and talking with friends and then reamerge an hour or so later realizing how much time you spent playing a rpg. The entire system is quite simple which could be good but either way in the end I would definetly reccomend this to anyone willing to try something old in thought but new in performance.","June 2","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't let ot's pixelated graphics and free price fool you. This game is amazing.\n\nThe world is HUGE. Quests can be found everywhere. 9.1 / 10.\n\nSUGGESTIONS:-\nMaybe make crafting alot more relevant. It's practically useless, or maybe only till where I've reached. The only time I ever craft something is when I'm out of gold to buy potions.\n\nMake the item description a little more detailed, for xample, I to this date don't know the difference between a Medium Armor and a Heavy armor, they have the same stats and price.\n\nAdd some more puzzles, but not too many as to make the game boring.\n\nCorrect the english xD #grammarnazi","June 3","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In most games like this you as a player should get a different feel when you play a different class. I do not really feel that in this game, i know this is a early acces but i hope they work on that. I love the other parts of the game i think it's great (I have a few hours on it on a different account)","June 5","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
