Planetarian ~the reverie of a little planet~ is made by the legendary company "Key", well known for creating Angel Beats!, Clannad and Little Busters! anime series. This game will guaranteed to touch you with the feels and make you cry.\n\nGood points\n- Fantastic character development & interactions between the two unique characters - The junker guy & Yumemi the gentle robot.\n- Very well presented that will easily set your mind into the wonderful world of Planetarian.\n- Delightful soundtrack & story. I love the soundtrack especially Gentle Jena, one of my favorite songs. The melody is so touching and charming. Listen to this piece & you'll be blown away https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR4dw_B423E\n- Beautiful illustrations. Yumemi looks pretty adorable & I like how it's suits her personally well.","September 12, 2014","true","295.9"," 214 of 243 people (88%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","88","214","243","15","31"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jfietkau/recommended/316720/","jfietkau","jfietkau","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jfietkau/","6660 products in account","Deep inside the old sarcophagus city, while searching for food, weapons, or resellable scraps, you make an unlikely discovery: What you'd assumed to be an abandoned military facility is actually a pre-war planetarium. And as it turns out, the custodian robot is still welcoming customers after all these years.\n\nLet's talk about planetarian ~the reverie of a little planet~.\n\nIt's a kinetic novel (a visual novel without any choices or other interactive game elements), so the only thing that the player/reader controls is the pace of the story. Do what you will with that information.\n\nOriginally developed by Key in 2004 and recently published on Steam by Sekai Project, this is widely considered a classic in the VN community, and a very worthwhile addition to the still meager selection of good visual novels on Steam. It's a short story about a world full of desolation, hopelessness, cynicism and resignation, and about a little robot girl who's immune to all of it. It's also about going stargazing in a world without stars.\n\nThe backgrounds and character sprites in planetarian are somewhat sparse in direct comparison to some of the more visually bombastic VNs out there. It is however very evocative, and with that it falls in line with the writing. The whole novel follows a slow pace -- never dragged out, but certainly deliberate. It leaves plenty of time for you and your own thoughts, and I urge you to take advantage of this invitation. I ended up with just over three hours of total playtime, which included some breathing room for the fantastic voice acting.\n\nAny good visual novel swings in tune with its soundtrack, and planetarian is no exception. Opening with the music box lullaby "The World of the Stars" it immediately offers you a glimpse of its gentle mood. Tracks like "Song of Starflight" accentuate the day-to-day interactions of the main characters with a lax and childish air, while the perhaps most iconic song of the roster, "Gentle Jena", cushions some of the more tender scenes in an aura of warmth and belonging (and I would encourage you to keep that last one playing in the background while you read the rest of this review).\n\nVisual novels as a medium don't lend themselves especially well to twitchy action stories, and despite the occasional surprise in that regard, the bulk of planetarian is about its characters and their interactions. Of the two main characters, only one actually appears on screen, and it would be a fair assessment to say that the story is about her, in several ways.\n\nYumemi (translated as "Reverie" in some localizations) is not the kind of quasi-human A.I. that we're used to from the likes of Cortana or EDI. She is a robot programmed for a very straightforward purpose. She oscillates between toddler-like naiveté at best, and robotic-algorithmic behavior at worst. So why do you entertain her thoughts of repairing the old projector? Why do you, a looter perpetually on the verge of starvation, end up tacking another night onto your stay at the old planetarium?\n\nThis story isn't about what Yumemi is, but about what she represents.\n\nSpending valuable time and energy on a planetarium of all things should feel frivolous, yes, downright sacrilegious. But there is something peculiar inside you, easy to explain away as idle curiosity about the starry night sky that you only know from old people's stories. Something you probably didn't think you still had. They say there was a time before the war, before the planet was shrouded by a thick layer of acid clouds, when people were able to look at the stars whenever they wanted. When there was still a notion of mankind eventually travelling to, and settling on, foreign worlds.\n\nBack when people still had hope for the future.\n\nYumemi was left behind at the beginning of the war, and despite not having had any sort of human contact in years, she diligently awaits the day's customers. There's only one thing she wants out of this existence, one thing she wants to do more than anything else in the world: to show you the stars.\n\nThe little robot girl, once built for the simple goal of caring for the planetarium's customers, ends up fulfilling a much grander purpose. Tucked away in her own little corner of a gray world inhabited by people who have forgotten what it means to be human, Yumemi is a shining beacon, a time capsule, a reminder that there is a star-filled sky right behind the acid clouds. Yumemi is the child, the lamb. She embodies innocence, childlike wonder, relentless optimism. Looking into her eyes, you cannot help but feel deeply ashamed for what the world has become.\n\nWhat was it, then, that made you stay at the planetarium? Was it really just idle curiosity? Or is there more to this little thought in the back of your head after all? Do you feel in your stomach what the place emanates? Does Yumemi give you the strength to dare to form the words, that maybe, just maybe... there is some hope left in this world? That there is such a thing as "the future"?\n\nYou should read planetarian if you have any interest in visual novels, if you haven't experienced a good story in a while, if you like looking up at the stars and wondering what the future holds, or if that little spark deep inside you that is almost drowned by cynicism needs a little bit of nourishment. Wholeheartedly recommended.","November 14, 2014","true","3.3"," 118 of 122 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","118","122","2","9"

I still remember when I first finished planetarian years ago. It is as soul-crushing as it is beautiful, and the impact still holds up against the best of Key's catalogue critically acclaimed visual novels. Thematically, it shares many ties to Key's most recent game Rewrite, which could be interpreted as an attempt at expanding upon the themes introduced in this game in a grander narrative. With that in mind, I would definitely recommend the two as complimentary to each other. If you're perhaps new to visual novels in general, then planetarian is definitely a good place to start. It demonstrates some of the very best of what visual novels have to offer in a tiny package; a small taste of what you can look forward to in the world of visual novels. It's also serves as a great appetiser to Key's brand, something to prepare your palate for the main course of Key's much larger games. I'd recommend this game to anybody who appreciates a good story that touches on some really powerful themes. It's not for the faint of heart, but once you've managed to overcome the pain it's bound to put you through, you might come out with something you didn't have before.\n\nParagraph taken from my full review:\nhttp://kazamatsuri.org/planetarian-the-reverie-of-a-little-planet-review/","September 12, 2014","true","63.8"," 112 of 122 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","112","122","0","0"

It does show its age (this VN was made 10 years ago) when you play the game and the 'save' function isn't great either, you only get 5 save slots, so you have to overwrite your saves quite a lot.\n\nThe story is set in the future after the "failure of the Space Colonization Program". It is a post-apocalyptic novel involving only 2 main characters "Mr. Customer" aka "The Junker" and Yumemi Hoshino aka the robot. There is no "choose your on route/story" in this VN, its a direct story with no choices.\n\nGraphicsAs you'd expect, this a pretty old VN, so graphics isn't its strong point here. It has basic drawn images and the animation is limited. Though the visuals are not the great part, you can still enjoy the VN with what is offers.\nFinal Score: 5/10\n\nStorylineThis is a VN by 'key' we are talking about, of course its going to tell you a great story. I have never read a VN by 'key' and said "I was disappointed with it". All their VNs are nicely told, it often gives you tears, but that’s part of the experience. Expect to cry in every VN that 'key' makes.\nFinal Score: 10/10\n\nSoundAnother strong factor here. The music and soundtracks are possibly the most satisfying thing you will love about this VN, considering that it is over 10 years old. I still have a hard time trying to figure out how they managed to make all these soundtracks, they are absolutely fantastic, even though half of them where very sad to listen to. The only downside is that there is only a few of these soundtracks.\nFinal Score: 9/10\n\nGameplay/Features/LayoutThe VN offers simple controls, press "Enter" to read another line, press "Spacebar" to hide the text box etc...nothing complicated there. The features are also very simple, since the VN is pretty old. It goes the same with the overall layout. Here's and great tip, tilt your head left or right in the title screen and be amazedFinal Score: 6/10\n\nPriceProbably the most common question when buying anything is "Is it worth buying it?". If you like light romance and sad stories. This is your best bet. You won't regret your choice, it was made by 'key', so you know it's worth it. At £7, this is a pretty cheap VN already, considering there are other VNs out there that cost more and has less stuff to offer. This is definitely worth your time and you shouldn't worry about spending too much on this.\nFinal Score: 10/10\n\nOverall Score : 40/50Percentage Score: 80%","April 17, 2015","true","6.2"," 62 of 67 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","62","67","5","7"

What first served as a game tester for Kinetic format turns out to be a hit sales when it was released back in 2004.\n\nI have played this novel over again and again on multiple platform yet the warm feeling of this novel still stucks in the back of my head like I just played it yesterday. The feeling that you get from this novel is overwhelming and the soundtrack delivers an epic blow alongside with the story. The graphic, while it is from 2004 is quite good and the design is also detailed.\n\nPlanetarian is a VN that I would always recommend to my friend who wants to try the VN medium as this VN is delivers such a great impact despite its short story.\n\nAlso, you should try listening to the Drama CD after finishing the game.

The fact I'm playing it for a second time means that it's doing something right.\n\nDeveloped by Key, 'Planetarian: ~The Reverie of a Little Planet~' takes place in a post-apocalyptic Japan. The Junker (the character you follow) hears rumours of a city that hasn't been exploited by other scavengers. In hopes to claim any goods, the Junker stumbles upon nothing but ruins and a robot girl named Yumemi Hoshino.\n\nThe story itself isn't very long, which is good considering it doesn't have a thousand story arcs like Clannad or Rewrite (some of Key's other works). It's just the right length to develop your characters and see them interact with each other as they try to overcome the problem at hand.\n\nThe Junker starts off as a jerk (although that's understandable) and he I didn't find him ver likeable in the beginning. What I don't like the most is that we are given bits of his past but they act more like references than tools to develop his character.\n\nYumemi, however, is the true star. She's a very thoughful and respective robot that takes care of the planetarian in the absence of civilization. Her attitude and general presence is almost heartlifting, and if you engrose yourself in the game you might even grow a smile on your face. You almost forget she's a robot by the end of the game.\n\nThe music is pretty nice. It's calming when it needs to be, but there are moments when the music stops and the only audio playing is the rain, which is really calming.\n\nSpeaking of which, the atmosphere is mostly pretty cheerful. Most of the time it's just the Junker and Yumemi talking, and the music in the background works very well in this respect. There are times when the rain just goes and it lets you take in everything you are experiencing. You can also tell by the end of the story just how heavy things are getting.\n\nIf you are considering this game I highly recommend you buy it. If you aren't interested in a story with no gameplay stay clear of this one there is no gameplay other than clicking to prceed to the next text. There aren't English voice actors either, so if you aren't fond of listening to two Japanese actors talking to each other I also recommend you stay clear of this game.","September 12, 2014","true","0.2"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","30","34","0","0"

This time key brings us a sadness but thoughtful story with a robot girl whose name is Hoshino Yomemi, which means the beautiful dream of the stars. I have read the whole Planetarian novels after played this game, so that I know the whole world of this novel series.Yomemi is a lovely girl, I DON'T think she is a ROBOT, but a HUMAN with all the beauties and she stands for the brightness of humanity. She is innocent and just like a child. Human destoried everything but she still believed that everything will become fine one day. I think the precious memories of Yomemi are the most moved part of this novel and I cried for nearly 2 hours after I watched that part. After played this game, I thought a long time, why human beings began to kill each other? Maybe they lost their emotions like love and mercy. After all, all these loves and mercies are given to Yomemi and she became the hope of human maybe. Though her body dead in the end, but her spirit was taken by us. By the way, the next novel called Man of Stars(maybe, I read this story in Chinese), in that story, our main character became a old man and show other people the beauty of stars, just like what Yomemi was done to him, and finally in a small village in South America, he dead with another robot which the same type of Yomemi, in that time, the South America was covered with ice and people could hardly survive. In that village, our main character teached 3 children many things of stars, knowledges, and some past stories. It's a sad end. Human couldn't avoid disappearing from this planet, but our spirit, our love, the dream of heaven, the heaven that won't be seperated, the hope, won't disappear.Actually, I think this game worth this price, in my opinion, it's even more worth than 60$, it makes us to thought what's the true love, what's the humanity, and I think it's even more thoughtful than some text book.","October 27, 2014","true","21.4"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","29","35","2","3"

Sekai Project already announced that they will be releasing Clannad on Steam as well, so you can be sure that this won't be the last.\n\nNote that Planetarian is a kinetic novel. This means that the player doesn't make any choices which impact the story, making it more akin to a graphic novel than a game. While many might argue that this would make it inferior to other VNs, the story is well written and satisfying enough where I am not bothered by the lack of choice. Both the artwork and the text are beautiful and bring the story to life.\n\nSo even if you don't normally play kinetic novels, I highly recommend you buy it anyways and try it for yourself. There's a reason Key/VisualArt's is as well known for their VNs as they are (hint: it's because they're geniuses). By buying this game, you are supporting Key/VisualArt's, Sekai Project, and Steam, which in turn will lead to more VNs being released on Steam!

It was my first entry into the VN genre, and as a kinetic novel, having only one route, it provides a simple, easy to understand and unfortunately brief experience. As a VN by Key, it boasts superb writing and amazing storytelling, even if the presentation is a bit dated. While the $10 price tag may be a bit steep for the short length of the game, it is incredibly potent and an interesting tale that questions what it means to be human, isolation, and companionship.

Needless to say, while this is a rather short experience... it'll be one that I'll cherish for many years to come.\n\nThe story, ranging from about 2-5 hours in length (depending on how fast you read), is set on a post-apocalyptic Earth far into the future. Resources, such as food, alcohol, and cigarettes are a rare and fought over commodity, resulting in life being drawn down to one fight after another, with the reward being to live another day on a barren, devoid of life Earth.\n\nThis is what sets the surprising tone for the male protagonist, who finds himself suddenly stumble upon a rather peaceful planetarium inhabited by but a sole female robot named Yumemi - modeled to be about 15/16 years old. Exhausted from fatigue, the nameless protagonist finds himself spending the evening inside the surprisingly well kept planetarium, which subsequently leads to him building an interestingly adorable relationship with Yumemi.\n\nThroughout, there are many laughable, sad, and also down right depressing moments, each of them fitting very cleanly into their scenes. The translation was also very good I feel, and I have no complaints beside a singular word that was not word wrapped, spreading over two lines - and this is me literally trying to squeeze out any issues, of which I feel there are none at all.\n\nUpon completion, there is also a Music and CG gallery unlocked.\n\nFor the price, it can be argued that $10 might be pushing it for some, but I don't like to aptly slap a value on an experience. Everyone will value this visual novel differently, and I would rather leave it for you to decide if it's priced right for you to experience a short, yet amazing story.\n\nI highly recommend this, both to visual novels veterans, and people new to the genre that would like to start somewhere easygoing.","September 15, 2014","true","4.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

(Took them long enough!)\n\nHeads up though this is not what you would call a game, it's more like an automatic book aka Kinetic Novel, which mean no interaction just reading and listening.\n\nFor me Key (Key Visual Art's for short) have been my favorite company ever since i first watched the anime called "Clannad". After finishing both seasons, i needed to fill the emptiness in my heart with more anime which were almost as good or closely like "Clannad", those were "Air", "Kanon", "Angel Beats" and "Little Busters!" (though LB! was 3-4 years later). What do they all have in common? Made by same company and highly rated anime and highly recommended. So Planetarian should'nt be an exception! Although all you do is read and listening. You will be dragged into that world, feel every happiness, sorrow and pain and ofcourse you will get attached to one of the characters! (in this case just one). Let us not forget the Background music! THOSE are the what i call Re-FEELer (see the pun there?) Every time i listen to one of Key's produced music, i end up remembering those moments in the anime/game and just standing there crying... Happened to me once at school when i was careless and the Yumegatari (a song from the anime "Air") was played my mobile, I sat there in class and dropped tears... just... just beautiful songs a-and.... it's so sad... but still so good...\n\nMy conclusion would be:\nBuy it if you rather want a good story to FEEL more than a gameplay. Cause if you want both get "To the moon" but if you want a gameplay?

Unlike many visual novels, there are no choices or branching paths, so it really doesn't feel too different from reading a book. It can be read through in about three hours' time, so it's not a huge time investment either - however I very much recommend it. Planetarian was made by Key, and anyone who knows Key will probably have a good idea of what to generally expect of this visual novel. And if you don't, this is a good starting point to get to know what Key can be like.\n\nThe story is set in a post-apocalyptic setting with most of humanity having been wiped out in a great war, poisonous rain pouring down without end, and everyone still alive struggling to survive. In this world our protagonist, the nameless Junker, enters a city where he hopes to find "treasure" or in other words, junk to sell or make use of. And by chance, he comes across the Planetarium, where he is greeted by a rather curious being, which doesn't really seem affected by the horrible state of the outside world at all. The rest is history.\n\nObviously with a length of just about three hours, Planetarian is not the greatest novel you will ever read. However, considering its short length I find it impressive what they did manage to create. I was skeptical about a visual novel made by Key without their most prominent storywriter - Jun Maeda - being involved, but I was pleasantly surprised. The total clash of worldviews brought by the two characters is well presented and it's easy to empathize with the main protagonist. In the end, I just wished it were longer. The world in Planetarian was quite interesting and I would have liked to see more of it. Nonetheless, I certainly was not disappointed by this novel.","September 12, 2014","true","2.9"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/palasvuash/recommended/316720/","palasvuash","Palas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/palasvuash/","66 products in account","Genre: Sci-fi/Drama\nDuration: About 4 hours\nDeveloped by: Key\nLicensed by: Sekai Project\n\nOnce you, the unnamed protagonist, reach the planetarium in a sarcophagus city, you meet this girl robot Yumemi. She talks a lot and insists in giving you a bouquet of junk. I like to refer to the protagonist as Mr. Customer, as that's how Yumemi refers to you. In any case, Planetarian spends a considerable amount of time explaining what has happened to the world and how desolate it is.\n\nYears ago, a full-scale war devastated Earth. Mankind built robots that could keep on identifying enemies and killing them even after all humans were decimated. And, indeed, human population decreased severely, to the point now there are only a few settlements left, far away from what we used to call "cities" back then. Some of said cities became sarcophagi, isolated and supposedly full of resources now rare in the few junkers who dare to trespass their walls' daily lives. The only two things that are constant in a human life now are fear and the rain.\n\nThe Rain is some sort of a third character. The war, in the end, doesn't matter; the destruction doesn't matter; the booby trap that killed the protagonist's partner some time ago doesn't matter - but the fact that there's an ever-present toxic downpour is very much stressed by the artwork and the text, since, after all, it's the solid representation of the misery the world is going through. What is the Rain like? It (or she, since "rain" is a feminine noun in Portuguese and I can't help but think of a rain as a feminine entity) is negative. Inexorably, unchangeably, untouchably so. She will not stop, she will not break, she will not waver. However, Mr. Customer learned how to live with her.\n\nSo you, the player, transit between two worlds: the barren outside, reigned over by the Rain, and the barren inside of the planetarium, reigned over by Yumemi. She knows every inch of the building. She's a robot, responsible for the planetarium. And what is she like? She is positive. Inexorably, unchangeably, untouchably so. She is a robot, programmed to be like this, yet "just a little broken". She cannot stop, she cannot break, she cannot waver. However, Mr. Customer learns how to live with her.\n\nWhat is the relationship between these two characters? None. They are completely unaware of one another and the protagonist is the bridge. It is confusing for Mr. Customer and it is confusing for you. The fact that you are the 2,500,000th customer (or, rather, the 2,497,290th customer, or rather rather, 2,497,288th visitor I think) is the whole reason why the story unfolds. She is not a human, there are never second intentions to what she says. She is what she is. She is the same as the Rain - they are two entities that can't ever touch because they are inexorable and will not, by essence and definition, change how they think and what they do.\n\nSo the story is about Yumemi and the Rain, or, rather, about the time you'll spend alongside an upbeat, bright, fun to listen to and just a little broken robot who thinks of the pernicious, toxic rain outside as  "an unfortunate weather", day by day. You're a bystander, yet you're the reason why the story unfolds. This is how planetarian ~reverie of a little planet~ drags you into its world and makes you deeply attached to a character, even without choices. Especially without choices.\n\nPositive:\n\n*It is one of the most touching stories on Steam. In fact, it's one of the most touching visual novels ever.\n\nNegative:\n\n*Might be expensive","December 26, 2014","true","5.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/recommended/316720/","Yureina","Yureina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/","463 products in account","Planetarian is a relatively short VN (~4 hours) that has no choices for the player to make, instead preferring to tell a set story of its own choosing. While this might bother some since that means that this "game" is little more than a few hours of reading with voices and artwork to go with it, the creators of Planetarian are none other than Key/VisualArts. If you are at all familiar with Key/VisualArts or their other works (notably Kanon, Clannad, and Little Busters!), then you have a pretty good idea what to expect from this: a well-written story, quality artwork, and a deeply emotional conclusion. While Planetarian is tiny compared to Key/VisualArts other VN's (Clannad is at minimum a 50+ hour game, and Little Busters! is about the same size), the quality of their other works ought not to be ashamed by this. In other words, Planetarian is quite good, despite its length and lack of choice.\n\nIf you are familiar with Key/VisualArts other works and enjoyed them, then checking this out should be a no-brainer. If you are not however, consider Planetarian a small teaser for what is to come: Clannad will be released on Steam before the year is out (Fall 2015 most likely), and hopefully Key/VisualArts' other works like Kanon or Little Busters! won't be too far behind. Or you can just watch their anime versions if you can't wait that long (I personally recommend Kanon 2006 and Clannad/Clannad After Story for that).

And in case you don't know, this studio likes to literally ♥♥♥♥ with your feels. So I knew what I was going into.\n\nSo, what is this game? This is a kinect visual novel, that means it literally is a book with pictures, music and voice acting. In most VN you can choose your own ending by making choices that affect it. Here, it is just like normal book: one plot line from the beggining to the end.\n\nWhat is the story? It is about man, imply called "Jumker", who once visits planetarium, where lonely robot, called Hoshino Yumemi, wants to show your stars, but unfortunetely, the projector is broken. I believe that is all you need to know about this game. I was certainly suprised how grimm this story is and even more of its setting. I highly recommend you to NOT read the summary and/or tags, I think it kinda ruins the whole suprise thing. But why? Because the story is so touching that you should experience the bad things as you play, not before you even start. At least that is how I look at it.\n\nI can't really say much about the story because I would just spoil it. Let's move on chacters. There are only two. The main protagonist, "Junker" (yeah, we don't get to know his name) and Hoshino Yumemi. Junker is your solitary protagonist, minding his own bussines. Yumemi is the polar opposite. Robots in this world are programmed to serve and obey humans. She cares about our hero only because her software is telling her so. Oh, and she is very, but very talkative. Even though Yumemi is robot and is behaving like one, there is no way you won't think of her as a human for at least one time. And that is truly something. We are constantly reminded that she is indeed robot, both by her actions, dialog and by narrator. And yet, I could not help myself but think of her as a human. It was not her character sprite, it was the writing that has done so. And I did not even notice it. There was a perfect balance between reminding us that she is just a robot and making her feel so human. It was just incredibly well made. The sprite, the voice acting, the dialog, everything worked.\n\nThe chemistry bewtween these two is also quite noticible, especially near the end. I did not believe that all was Yumemi was doing for Junker was because her software told her so. I just didn't. And I think that was the point. I think it is amazing that they managed in less the 5 hours make robot feel more human then our main character and everybody else in the world.\n\nAnd speaking or writing, you could just rip it out of this game, paste it on paper and nobody would really notice that this was at first VN. Unlike some other VNs at Steam, this is a huge achievemnt. That is not to say rest of it is completely unnecessary.\n\nI can say like 10 words in Japanese so I have no right to judge the voice acting. Yes, this novel is fully voice acted, even MC got his own voice actor. But VA of Yumemi was just joy to listen to. Her voice felt robotic and human at the same time. Junker does not really talk much with the exception of the ending. But he gives of that "lone wolf" vibe, if it makes sense. Nonetheless, they were both very entertaining.\n\nThe art in this game is great. Yumemi's design is just gorgeous, you can see for yourself in the pics above. The overall art really helps the atmosphere. However, one issue I have with the look of this game is its layout. I don't understand why they thought making the background one small imagine and putting it on the top of the screan and filling the rest with some random gears while putting the text into the box at the bottom was a good idea. It feels odd, especially since Yumemi covers the entire right part of the screen and it does not really add to anything in my opinion. Some images cover almost the entire screen too, that looked great, I don't know why they made almost the entire game like that. And another thing, the whole escape menu looks exactly the same as your choice options when you right click on your desktop. It looks bad and incredibly out of place.\n\nSoundtrack for most part is quite nice. The whole soundtrack, as far as i know, is around 40 minutes long. That being said, it is the something I would want to listen to while doing something else. The one track that, however, stood out was Gentle Jena. My god, this song is the definition of beautiful. Go and listen to an extended version, you won't regret it.\n\nThere are in total 19 achievemnts, two of which you get for entering CG Mode and Music mode, which you unlock at the after you finish the game. You can finish it in less then 3 hours if you are fast reader and you are not using voice acting (which I don't recommend). Yes, it is very short. But I don't think that is a problem. Who said all good stories had to be super long? But that brings another issue- the price. 10€ for 3-5 hours long game is too much. Wait for it to be on sale.\n\nTL;DR\npros:\n+story, simple, yet beautiful\n+charcters\n+Yumemi's design\n+atmosphere\n+chemistry\n+art\n+its messege\n+feels included for all you masochists like me ^^\n\ncons:\n-layout\n-lazy and ugly in-game menu\n-price\n\nFinal Verdict: 9/10\n\nJust like every other game made by Key, this is also beautiful and simple tale with powerful message, nice art and good soundtrack to support it all. But despite its pros, it is not really worth 10€. Put it to your wish list and wait for sale, then buy it as fast as you can, you won't regret it.\n\nI also recommend this game to everyone who is interested in VN but has yet to find a good place to start. Just like I said it is very short, so you won't really feel like you have wasted too much time if you end up disliking it.","February 14","true","3.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I have played the original Japanese version on both Windows and Playstation 2. But due to the bad time when it was hard to buy oversea games in China, both version I played were pirates. Now, my excitement is beyond my expression, because I could finally pay for the game on Steam. Kudos to Steam!\n\nI'm not going to tell you how amazing it is, since the only way to feel the game is to play it by yourself. The only con I find for this game is that its Japanese texts are encoded in Shift-JIS, not Unicode, and therefore it won't work on non-Japanese systems.\n\nYeah, I know, I could play it in English. But it's really weird to enjoy a typical Japanese Gal-Game in English, especially when you are fluent in Japanese. I wish the developer could convert all texts from Shift-JIS to Unicode, as all modern games do, so that we could enjoy the game in Japanese on more systems.\n\nThe latest update seems to have added achievements. It's not a bad idea for achievements fans, but you really can't expect too much, because planetarian is a very pure visual novel with no choices at all. There is only one way to the only one ending, with only one heroine. No multiple endings, no multiple routes, no New Game+, no nothing.\n\nIt takes you at most 5 minutes to get all achievements. But is this a game from which you could enjoy yourself by getting achievements? This is purely a visual noval. This is an amazing visual novel that you'll never forget.","April 28","true","0.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Silvachief/recommended/316720/","Silvachief","Silvachief","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Silvachief/","190 products in account","tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nPlanetarian is a Visual Novel rather than a game as we usually know them. It consists of a story, much like a normal novel, but with the addition of both background and character art as well as music and voice-acting. The combination makes for an experience with the depth and connection of a novel and the ability to bring characters to life like a movie. They're generally very good at playing with your emotions.\n\nPlanetarian is a great way to find out what Visual Novels are like. It's a little older than its more modern counterparts but packs an incredibly emotional story into a relatively small package and you most certainly won't regret giving it a go.\n\nFor those of you wanting a more in-depth review, this is from my blog:\n\nPlanetarian is probably the greatest example of concentrated visual novel quality, telling a simple but powerful story in its four hours or so of content that still manages to capture your imagination and emotions. I was certainly entertained despite it being my second run-through, so you can be sure it’s worth picking up.\n\nThe world’s in a pretty pathetic state, by anyone’s standards. Those who have managed to survive this long do so by rummaging through former societies’ leftovers, and are constantly plagued by the Rain which eats through just about everything it touches. Lured by the promise of untapped treasures, a lone Junker makes his way through an abandoned city. Wary of deadly robots and lethal mines, he’s more than a little surprised to find he’s the 2,500,000th customer of what must be the sole surviving planetarium on Earth. It’s attendant humanoid robot girl wouldn’t let something as insignificant as the end of the world get in the way of delivering the best possible experience to her customers, however, even if she could understand that her most prized performance was never going to be seen again.\n\nI’m consistently amazed by Planetarian’s ability to promote profound thought while telling what is really a very simple story. It doesn’t weave anything near an epic tale but still presents unforgettable characters (or character, I suppose) and leaves a lasting impression because of the issues it raises. One of the great things about the way it does this is how it manages to set the scene it wants to get across without becoming bogged down in details, which is a major problem for some visual novels; I knew enough about the story’s background for it to have coloured my experience even though exploring it was never Planetarian’s focus.\n\nKey is famous for playing with its audience’s emotions. What makes this particular story special, though, is that the character they use to do that is distinctly not human. The planetarium’s android attendant, Yumemi, could never be mistaken for a living, breathing person, an impression which is confirmed multiple times over the course of the story. Despite this, by the end of the visual novel, you find yourself caring for her as much as you might for any other character which is something I think Key deserves a lot of praise for. Without going into detail, Planetarian has some very high and very low emotional moments that are handled exceptionally well.\n\nHaving been originally released in 2004, Planetarian’s visuals aren’t as flashy as what you may be used to, though they’re still nice to look at. Relatively drab background art still manages to do its job and is made up for by Yumemi’s wonderful character design and the small number of CGs that show up. The unique feature of having the character sprites take up the entire screen works well, especially considering Planetarian’s focus is very much on its single visible character. While many parts of the visual novel are completely lacking background music, what you do get fits the feeling of the story perfectly and is very easy on the ears. For the most part the official translation is good and sounds natural but doesn’t quite have the quality of appropriately idiomatic English I’ve seen from the best translators (eg. Dangan Ronpa, Grisaia no Kajitsu). There were a few typos in the version I played, though Sekai Project was very quick to reply to my report and I assume they’ve been fixed for the final release.\n\ntl;dr – Planetarian is absolutely the best visual novel of its length out there, fitting the role of a short story in visual novel form expertly. It keeps its readers well entertained for its entire length and manages to include poignant emotion in a unique way that is definitely worth experiencing. Despite being an older title its visual and audial components work together well even if they don’t stand up to either newer or longer visual novels’ standards. All in all, I think it is almost required reading for visual novel lovers and even makes for a great entry point into the genre for newcomers, especially considering its easily-digestible length.\n\nScore: 8.5/10 - Good","September 12, 2014","true","4.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Mainly because it's hard for me to put my feelings about this game into words (also I'm lazy). I will admit it, I ♥♥♥♥ing cried at the ending. And let me tell you, I rarely cry at this sort of sentimentality.\n\nPlanetarian ~the reverie of a little planet~ is about the Junker and his meeting with Yumeni, an android left behind to care for a planetarian within an abandoned city. Everyday she does the same thing, she heads outside, even when admist acid rain, and tries forlornly to attract customers. Her one companion is Miss Jena, a broken projector. When the Junker visits the Planetarian in the hopes of loot, he encounters Yumeni, who claims he is their 2,500,000th customer. The Junker agrees to fix 'Miss Jena' in the promise of seeing their show. What follows is a tear-jerker of a VN about a robot who's only wish is for heaven to not be split between machines and humans, and a man who learns to dream of stars.\n\nThe story is set in a dystopian world, where nuclear war has left humanity in ruin and leaves the ever-present 'Rain', acid rain as a side-effect of the nuclear fallout. The few humans that survived are hunted by automated robots that act as if the world never ended, killing any human they detect. Some people act as scavengers, referred to in-universe as 'Junkers', of which the MC of Planetarian is one.\n\nGet it. Just get it. It's a masterpiece. The soundtrack ranges from the beautiful and dreamy, to the slow and melancholic. The artists did an excellent job capturing the dystopian feel and bringing characters to life (although it is a bit dated in terms of fidelity. Keep in mind however that it was originally released in 2004). It's brilliant and worth every penny. £6.99 is well worth this title.\n\nCongratulations Key on making me cry my eyes out.\n\nAnd also, ♥♥♥♥ you for making me feel.\n\nSome notes:\nPlay time of about 3 hours (I do play through VNs slowly however)\nSteam version doesn't come with the soundtrack for personal use (you will have to be content with youtube or other means i.e. Itunes unfortunately :( then again I didn't try that hard apart from a quick internet search)\nVoice acting is available, however I didn't play with them on so I am unaware how good they are\nNo fan service or NSFW content in any shape or form\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I'm going to sit in the corner and cry after remembering the ending You were never broken Yumeni. We're the ones that are broken\n\nPS apologies for the ♥♥♥♥♥ review. I'm pretty lame at this kind of thing but I need to get my feelings about this game across before I explode from the feels.

Games like Planetarian are the reason why I came to love visual novels as a medium for story telling.\n\nSince the game is short saying anything about the story feels like a spoiler. If you like stories set in an post apocalyptic world, or endearing emotional stories, then this is a story for you.\n\nCalling Planetarian a game maybe a bit misleading too, as this is the only visual novel I've played where you don't actually make any choices. Planetarian is a linear story that is backed up by music, voice acting and images, and has a convenient way of saving your progress.\n\nIf you have never tried a Visual novel before, or don't think much of the ones you have tried before, you should give this game a try. Planetarian is a good example of what a visual novel can be, that's been squeezed into a very small package. Even If it's not your thing, the game is relatively short and not a big time investment.  There is almost nothing to lose, and possibly something to gain, so try it =)\n\nPS. If you finish Planetarian and want more, there is a Drama CD you can likely find on Youtube that adds to and continues the story somewhat.","September 12, 2014","true","6.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I would highly recommend this visual novel/game to others because it's an easy read, considerably quick, and it makes you feel something. Regardless of what the feelings may be, it accomplishes what it sets out to do. This visual novel evokes emotions and it's even a little educational, in the aspect of astronomy. Like many other Key productions, the story sticks with you. The story takes you somewhere else during certain parts and the soundtrack is wonderful.

On one hand, there's the base concept that you're essentially reading a book, just with more visual elements. On the other hand, you've got a great deal of depth provided by branching choices and character investment as a result. Planetarian is a kinetic novel - that is, a visual novel without choices - and it's the best introduction one can get to the medium, bar none. The experience is short - maybe four to five hours, depending on your reading speed - but substantial, and the primary drive of the experience, the story, is yet another masterpiece from Key Visual Arts.\n\nYou play "The Junker" and you meet "The Reverie," a girl in a planetarium in the dark, dystopian future. That's the game, that's the story - and yet, for all its simplicity, the beauty the narrative manages to portray and the attachment it builds for the characters in such a short time span is astounding, especially in a gaming scene where it's common for the story to be so shallow that remembering any element of it is a monumental task (remind me, exactly what did I do in the last five Call of Duty installments?).\n\nPlanetarian is a quick, satisfying story that is an excellent introduction to the Visual Novel medium.

As the story went by & from the conversations between the protaganist & Yumemi, I slowly felt drawn to this novel. I, myself, wanted to take Yumemi away from the Planetarium where she would be safe & live with the remaining humans.\n\nI thought she would make it out with the protaganist & see the world for herself. I thought I wouldn't feel anything special but I was wrong, dead wrong. When Yumemi stood between the protaganist & the droid, I knew something bad is about to go down. As the story drew to a close, I found myself sobbing...\n\nIn her honor, I'll change my name & display pic for Hoshino Yumemi, the robot who serves humans with loyalty & wishes for people to visit & see the stars, as well as for heaven to not be divided in two....","September 18, 2014","true","2.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Pretty much every scene is filled with details. The game suffers from a shortage of CGs, but your imagination (and the writing) will make up to it.\n+ nice atmosphere. I don't care much about the war and the state of the current world, but planetarian gives you some nice insight without going astray from the main plot.\n\nThe bad:\n- soundtrack feels a bit tiresome after the first hour. Music turns me on, and 07th Expansion novels always did a great job with it. Might say that I was left a bit disappointed with Key's planetarian. Kinect Novels should always be filled with music, and planetarian does feature only a few of them.\n- feels a bit old. Old is not necessarily bad, but planetarian suffers from this feeling that you are touching a very old Visual Novel. Looks and feels a bit outdated, but not bad. Some scenes and effects are still quite impressive.\n- lacking in the CG department. Lots of CG potential wasted here. The couple of CGs you get are not bad, though.\n\n\nTL;DR? planetarian is a nice little visual novel. If that's going to be your first VN, you won't be disappointed. If you already read a lot of VNs before, you'll be missing a lot skipping this one.\nA must-play for veterans and newcomers. The asking price is low enough to be worth the two or three hours of gameplay.\n\nScore: 8/10\n\nPardon me for any misspellings and incomprehensible sentences.\nAnd before I forget: Yumemi is really cute.

My friend gifted this to me. And I thought I knew what to expect. I did not.\n\nThis isn't a game, thats the first thing. No choices, no multiple endings. You progress by reading text. That's all there is\n\nGraphic wise, it isn't as "modern" nor as intricate as most modern Visual novels and/or animations. But its enough for most of the time.  The writing though is superb. Its quite a change of pace for me who plays fast-paced games.\n\nThe music is really good for its time, hopefully it still is now. At least I think that way.\n\nCmon, for many Visual Novel readers, obviously, "KEY" is a group well know for their novels. This one of them.\n\nSo heres my recommendation.\n\nIf you are neck deep into visual novels that have multiple endings, multiple characters, multiple choice. This might not be your cup of tea, but then again, this IS Key we're talking about.\n\nBut if you want a change of pace, a relaxing trip of feels, then "planetarian ~the reverie of a little planet~" might be just for you.\n\n\nOn a less serious note,\n\nI rate it "I need a hug" out of 10","November 28, 2014","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was develped by  VisualArt's/Key who has won my deepest respect are CLANNAD, AIR, Kanon, and Angel Beats!. Reading Planetarian has taken me a Feel-trip rollercoaster, swirling my emotions and possibly giving me a reason to enjoy the life i have from the depiction of Planetarian's world.\n\n"Because the point of the War was no longer the conquets of land;\nit had become nothing more than the internecine creed of revenge and massacre"\nThe set story and the emotions displayed throughout it, make this a visual novel worth reading. The story depicts Humanity's biggest mistakes. They have shotgunned theirself in the foot, and now the tiny fabrics of what is left only tells us how far we have distroyed ourself. For those who well still alive, apathy and selfishness fills their hearts. Survival seems to be the only real key of extence.\nHumanity has fallen from grace.\nIt's something we can relate to, like that of the Cold Wars. A scary time where we coud have destoyed ourselfs. The threat was real, and it has been depicted muliple times again of the horrid results of our actions. Planetarian is an example of it.\nThe world in Planetarian is a dark and ugly place. Why would it be that this story touched my heart? The key word is simple: Hope{/b].  Hope that came from a bubbly robotand apatheic Junker, Yumemi and 'Mr. Cutsomer'\n\n"Please do not divide Heaven in two."\n"That is my prayer to the God of Robots."\nThe characters of our story were easy to fall in love with. Hoshino Yumemi, our planetarian Robot, gave of us joy for her undieing love to teach people about the stars. Set in a time where she could not comprehend, Yumemi uplifts the spirit to your character and channels happiness through her bubbly attitude.\nYour main character, 'Mr. Customer', sets the reality of the story and how humanity has met its tragic fate. He is set in a time with no law or any real social establishment. As a Junker only for means to make ends-meat, Mr. Customer wonders into an uninhabitable city looting for supplies and something worth bartering. His initial scavage into the city seems like a big waste, but finds something worth more valuable to him than any cigarettes or booze could ever be.\n'Mr. Customer' was nothing more than an apathetic Junker at the beginning, but grows to love and cherish the memories of Yumemi.\n\n"Mankind will be able to solve all its problems, and one day reach out to the world of the stars."\nPlanetarian is nothing but an inspiring story of hopes and dreams of something better for a ravaged world. A world torn to pieces that affect our main character, 'Mr. Customer', but he finds his piece of salvation from our loving Planetarian, Yumemi.\nIf you have never read a visual novel in your life and want to read something dramatically touching, Planetarian ~the reverie of a little planet~ is for you. There will be moments of bitter happiness, laughter, and saddness as you read.\nIt's a beautiful story.\nA story that only VisualArt's/Key could ever write.\n\n"All the stars in the sky are waiting for you."","January 19, 2015","true","20.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you've played it again and still don't feel it.\nYou Monster.\n\nOn a more less serious note.\nThis is a Visual Novel through and through, so keep that in mind.\nThe story is a lovely different take on the "AI of the future" concept, you remember they saying "In the future, AIs will destroy humans"? Yes, the story has that, but it also explored the other side, where an AI will faithfully follow humans, the main character is the embodiment of that.\n\nThe music is always nice and soothing, sometimes carry a tune of cheerfulness, sometimes a hint of melancholy and sadness, it's simply wonderful.\n\nThe art is cute, of course, but express the tone of the story very well, I find the contrast between Yumemi (the man character) and everything surrounds her a good representation of the tone of the story.\n\nKey has never disappoint with their Visual Novels, no matter which one I look at, I can't find a reason to not like it, this is why I hate them, they always bring along the Rain with them.\nIf you don't mind reading, you may find this story making your heart skip a beat, and I wish upon a star that it will.","January 10, 2015","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

T_T\n\nThis reminded me a bit of a Ray Bradbury story in some ways.\nWithout spoiling anything, here is a description. This is the story of a man living in a post-apocalyptic world who travels from place to place in search of valuable items left behind or not yet discovered by other "junkers." He comes across a robot who no longer really has a purpose in the world. Despite this, she (the robot is made to look like a young girl) is still happy and working hard even though there is no need, because it's all she knows. He is irritated by her ceaseless talking and sunny disposition but eventually comes to care about her and forms a somewhat-friendship. They have a lot of interesting/sad/humorous conversations throughout the story and eventually set out on a small adventure.\n\nThat's all I can really say without spoiling too much. It's a touching story and if you haven't tried a visual novel on Steam I definitely reccomend this one. I know some people don't like them because there's usually little-to-no gameplay but this one has a good story and it's worth the read.","March 19","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's just text and images and music, and it tells a beautiful and bittersweet story.\n\nIt follows two characters from the moment they meet. One, a "junker", a man who braves autonomous military robot infested ruins in search of valuable relics of an earlier age. The other, a servant robot, tasked with running an old planetarium, who's been faithfully waiting for thirty years for the return of co-workers and customers that no longer exist in this post-apocalyptic world.\n\nWhat's really brilliant is how well the writers conveyed the lonliness of an artificial intelligence that was designed to serve human beings. Her behavior patters clearly indicate a desperate need to interact with people, even as her possible behavior's are limited. Lonliness, even anguish, are portrayed through the juxtaposition of various pre-programmed behaviors. It was as heart-wrencing as it was brilliant.\n\nWon over in spite of himself, the junker attempts to repair the projector so she can run another planetarium show. Does he succeed? What happens after? To go any further would be to spoil the story beyond what is reasonable.\n\nA word on whether or not the ending is happy or sad, since that seems to matter to some people. It is not happy. It is bittersweet, at best. It is very sad. If you don't like sad endings, you might be disappointed. Then again... you might not. The game doesn't cost much, so give it a try.","February 16","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All in all, I highly recommend.\n\nLike many good stories, when this one was over I wished there was much more to it.  (I have kept my description of the story separate below).  The beginning was a bit slow and there were times during the story that it seemed to meander.  And there were some jumps in the story from current time to memory that could have been smoother.  However, if you watch/read this VN push through the parts that seem slow because they give perspective and provide background to frame later parts of the story.  All in all a complete story was built and came together wonderfully right through to its completion.\n\nMore about the story if you want to know (no spoilers)...\nThis is a tale told through a protagonist that you never see and his interaction with a robot.  The protagonist is a junker that scavenges cities et al to survive.  As the interaction between the junker and the robot progressess you learn why the world is in a dismal, post-apocalyptic state and how the protagonist has experienced it.  His view on the world, built from his experiences, is grim and hopeless.  Yumemi, the robot, has a childlike, hopeful view of things as she has been mostly shielded from the events of the last thirty years.  As the host at a planetarium she waits to show visitors the wonders of the stars - a wonder that has long been forgotten in a world of constant rain and gray skies.  The junker sees Yumemi as a mild annoyance and he expresses his annoyance at times.  Yumemi, however, remains positive and optimistic in her interacton with the junker.  How this chance encounter progresses and what we learn about the world, the people, and the robots, is, to me, the core and beauty of the story.  Oh yeah, and there are some emotional moments if you hadn't already guessed.  I highly recommend.","November 16, 2014","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Would I recommend this:\nYes, if you like a touching short story which revolves around a Robots "dreams".\nNo, if you prefer the adventure type of visual novel. There is pretty much no adventure in this novel.","September 13, 2014","true","2.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It won't take too much of your time, but I believe you're going to enjoy it.\n\nAlso, if you enjoyed the setting of planetarian, Key has released a drama CD containing sides stories, which include a prologue and an epilogue for planetarian as well.

I would strongly reccomend this to both new and experienced VN readers. (Also, the Japanese version is available when you buy the game on steam, if you can read Japanese characters. The language can be changed in the game's prefrences by right clicking it.)\n\nIts about a 4-5 hour read if you like to listen to the dialouge, and maybe about 2 and a half hours if you skip most of it. The music is ok, its nothing amazing, the CG and backgrounds are fairly decent, but what makes this game is the story and the writing. Honestly, I just burst out crying at the end. It is such a powerful and beautiful story that everyone should read. Honestly, this is just incredible. My rating of the title is 9/10. The only reason it doesnt score a perfect 10 is the repetative music and sound effects. Honestly, some more work could have been done there to further justify this otherwise stunning and incredible story.\n\nA little about the story:\nThis short novel set in a post apocalyptic earth, tells the story of a "junker", who meets a half broken robot in a long abandoned planetarium. There, seeking refuge from the never ending, radioactive "rain" and lethal murderous robots, he happens to enter during the one week of the year which the robot is functunal. Bad luck? Faith? Regardless of the reason, the robot, Hoshino Yumemi, (ほしのゆめみ), tries to do her job and show him the stars. But the big telescope inside the planetarium is broken after 30 years of not being used. In the abandoned and worn down planetarium, in a broken world, he decides to stay and try to fix the telescope...","December 5, 2015","true","4.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

It doesn't have the amazing character art that we've all come to love and expect from Key[i.imgur.com], but I guess the one character in the game doesn't look all that bad, so I guess it's okay. In terms of audio, there were a few moments I was tempted to mute or lower the volume from just being slightly annoyed by it, but otherwise the soundtrack was pretty nice to listen to, and I felt it fit well with the rest of the game.\n\nBut it's not the visuals or soundtrack that's the most important, you play a visual novel for the writing. While I felt some parts dragged on a bit too long, the overall story was short enough that I think it can be excused for that. When playing English translations of Japanese visual novels, it's common to see words cutting off at the end of the line or needing a second page to finish a sentence. I only noticed this happening once throughout the game.\n\nIf you've already experienced and enjoyed any of Key's other works, then you already know this game is worth getting. If not, I guess a good place to start would be the Angel Beats anime series. It's 13 episodes long and free to legally watch on Crunchyroll[www.crunchyroll.com].","June 1, 2015","true","4.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Yumemi is very adamant about protecting humans and is happiest when she is helping those she serves. When she is unable to help someone, she gets terribly worried that she is incapable of offering assistance and must instead indirectly help a customer by directing him or her to someone who can. Protecting humans is her top priority and will even ignore previous orders to make sure no human is harmed when in her care. the story was fascinated thou it was short and it takes roughly 3 hours to read the story, it's also a Kinetic Novel which means you don't have to interact the story and enjoy the reading and listening. the novel has lacking of supporting characters which some were minor but the drama in this game was the same feeling that Key's other visual novel had. CGs were gorgeous and the soundtrack sound perfect but it sometimes repeat during the novel, if you are interested of reading a Japanese Visual Novel then Planetarian would be perfect for you and i give this game novel a 8.8 out of 10\n","October 25, 2014","true","7.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you're not into Manga then this is a total waste of money.  Japanese seem to have some weird fetish with young girls especially with cat ears that I find creepy.  In this story it's a robot that looks like a 15 year old and about as dumb and naive as one which is intended to be "cute" and help the reader make an emotional connection with the character, but it is just a robot and one that talks a lot making it very annoying, which again I think is supposed to lend it to being 'cute'.

Most of the comedy comes from one running joke that I found to be annoying more often than humorous, though I will admit that the tool variant briefly brought a smile to my face. Other dialogue is also repeated more times than necessary.\n\nThere was little plot to be had. The majority of the story takes place in one setting, with the occasional flashback to remind the reader that it's a post-apocalyptic world full of muderbots. I also feel that there was an early plot hole with the narrator not wanting to stay at the Planetarium, then deciding to do so for no apparent reason without showing any signs of having warmed up to the robot yet. Near the end, the story showed a hint of heading toward one tragic conclusion that could've worked well and it started getting good after finally leaving the Planetarium. However, the ending they went with was the more clichéd one that could be predicted immediately upon meeting the clearly designed to be cute robot, and when the moment to cry came, it made no impact on me. Afterward, the conclusion implied by the final lines brought me sadistic joy, though I don't think that's the reaction they were going for.\n\nWith all that said, the story was not without its better moments. I sort of laughed on three occasions and the scene with the robot's narration on the stars was beautiful. However, I do not think it was enough to be worth the time and money put into going through it when there are better visual novels out there.","September 26, 2014","false","4.5"," 62 of 211 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","62","211","0","18"

There is only one route and one ending, and you progress simply by reading through the story. If you're looking for a 'visual novel' with choices and multiple endings, this may not be for you. Still, Planetarian presents a good story that's well worth the price.\n\nI've heard about this game for a while. "It's a story that'll make you cry!" they said. Well, I've never cried after watching movies/reading stories/playing games, but Planetarian got me real close to that.\n\nI won't talk about the story, since the story IS short. If you want a non-spoilery blurb about what this game is about, the description in the "About This Game" segment is good enough. What I can say is that even if you saw through the tricks and predicted the ending to varying degrees of accuracy (like I did), the delivery is done well enough to still be impactful, for me at least.\n\nThe voice-acting in the game, as I understand it, was added for the PS2 release and is featured here. It's in Japanese, but visual novel enthusiasts probably wouldn't mind. Hoshino Yumemi, the robot girl, is voiced rather well. Her voice actor doesn't seem to do much work outside of visual novels though. However, the Junker, who narrates the story, is voiced by famous voice actor Daisuke Ono. He doesn't have a lot of lines, but they were delivered well.\n\nI'm not too familiar with Key or VisualArt, but the art is done quite well, and I say this about the CGs, backgrounds, and Yumemi's design herself. While her face is nothing distinctly unique, at least she doesn't come with the weird eyes that the characters in CLANNAD came to be known for. Plus, her costume design is quite unique.\n\nOverall, Planetarian is a good kinetic novel. I can recommend it for those seeking to try out reading visual novels, or someone who's looking for a story to read to pass 2-3 hours. It's not the BEST written work out there, but it's still an emotional, beautiful work.","January 9, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You will cry. No really, I don't care if you're a hardened badass, if you honestly sit down and invest yourself in this story you will cry.\n\nThis is my first time ever experiencing a kenetic novel and only the second visual novel. This is a much more powerful format then I originally thought and I'm sad that I haven't been looking at them more seriously until now.\n\nSince theres already a lot of reviews helpful to those who are familier with the format and those explaining the story, I'm going to be talking to people who don't 'do' visual novel games. I was very skeptical of the format. I didn't see anything about them other then the taste-less demodisks sometimes toted around large conventions. You know the type I'm talking about. Please, give this style of game a chance. Between this game and Hatoful Boyfriend, I was shown this style in the light it was truly ment to be in.\n\nThis game isn't quite a book but it's not a game in the traditional sense. It's a game in the same way Dear Ester is a game. It's not about choices, theres no puzzles or combat. It's an experience, it's a story, and it's brillient at delivering that story. There is text to read, like a traditional novel, but the music helps set the tone like a movie would and the visuals help to really feel connected to the characters, both the one you 'play' as and Yumemi, the robot girl you meet.\n\nLike I said before, the game has an overall sad tone. If that's a problem for you, for whatever reason, I would understand you skipping this title. If you think you'll be okay though, PLEASE, do yourself a favor. Buy this game. Sit back and enjoy it. The whole thing in one sitting might take... oh 4 hours or so. If you can't do it all in one sitting theres a save function.\n\nJust... just give it a try.\n\nAll the stars in the sky are waiting for you.","January 23, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is the story of an android, and her first customer in nearly thirty years. Like any great novel, or peice of literarure, it has ups and downs. Times you're laughing, times you're angry, and, of course, times you're crying. I think that this would make a great introduction in to the world of Visual Novels (VNs), or another good read for those who play them regularly. Planetarian is of course a bit different from most VNs, as there is no branching paths in the story. We call ones like these Kinetic. In any case, I felt it was a bit expensive for only about five hours of reading. My advise would be to wait until it is on sale, or try a few free VNs, like Juniper's Knot by Dischan Media, another Knetic novel like this.\n\nI'm gonna give this a 9/10. The only obsticle to really manage is that the only options you get are when you open it. If you want to change any settings, you have to right click.

The beautiful twinkling of eternity that will never fade. All the stars in the sky are waiting for you."\n\nClocking in at just under 5 hours if you leave auto-read on, planetarian is quite short for a visual novel, but manages to tug quite hard at your heartstrings considering its length. Those of you who have read Key visual novels in the past or watched anime adaptations of them (Clannad, Kanon, Angel Beats, etc.) will know what to expect from planetarian in the emotions department. Those of you that haven't done so, fair warning:\n\nBe prepared to cry.\n\nKey's works are famous for their tear-jerking properties, and planetarian is no exception.\n\nGetting back to the cold, analytical side of things, planetarian was made back in 2004 - 11 years ago, as of this time of writing. Unfortunately, its age shows a little bit. It's restricted to a 4:3 presentation, so you'll get black bars on the sides of your monitor if you try to go fullscreen.\nUnless I didn't dig hard enough, you can't manually set the resolution either, which is annoying, but only that; the resolution that's set is just fine - it's probably whatever resolution the original graphics were meant to appear in - and I never had a need to change the resolution for anything during my run. Thankfully, none of the aforementioned graphical issues really detract from the enjoyment of planetarian, as they're all minor annoyances at best, and understandable ones at that.\n\nThe soundtrack is good, though I felt a couple tracks early on were too short considering how long they played. The title theme and "Perfectly Human" in particular stuck out to me as memorable tracks. I can't claim to understand Japanese aside from a few common words and phrases, and the voice acting is entirely in Japanese, so I can't comment on the voice acting much.\n\nI notice a lot of people praise the translation. I can't read the original script, but the translated one felt a little bit stilted to me, as if the translation was purely mechanical, paying no attention to how an ordinary English speaker would normally phrase things. Again, nothing major, just a nitpick.\n\nAll in all, planetarian was a short, sweet, touching visual novel that I heartily recommend to anyone, regardless of prior visual novel experience.\n\nBut bring tissues.\nYou'll be using them, trust me.","March 16, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Should I mention that the illustrations are gorgeous ? No, i didn't think so, it's obvious so moving on.\nThe end is really powerful in emotions and you can be sure that you'll let out a tear no matter what. (In fact, the whole story is really a journey filled of emotions and really well constructed)\nAbove all, this VN conveys a strong message that i'll let you discover by reading this VN :)\n\nIn the end, Planetarian ~The Reverie of a Little Planet~ is simply a masterpiece of which the story will stick in your mind for a long time but in a good way. You'll remember it as a damn fine story (which made me willing to read other VNs), and if you're ,like me, new to VNs , it's definitely worth every penny you spend to buy this.\n\nMy rating : 10/10 ...... hell, even 15/10","October 5, 2014","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As one of key's first game, it aged well and there was a quite a bit of concepts that will influence their later development. The post-apocalyptic world setting will resound in the Clannad: After Story, Angel Beats!, and especially Akane and Terra Route of Rewrite. The story is a simple one, a junker found a robot in a planetarium that has been long abandoned. In its core, a typical boy-meets-girl story, hopeful but with a bite.\n\nThe presentation itself is masterful. World design is distinct but not far-reached, creating a mournful and mysterious mood. The strongest point is probably the character design. Both the visual and audio presentation is superb. The weariness and indifference of the main character plays a perfect foil to the enthusiam and curiosity of Hoshino Yumemi.\n\nAs short as it is, no words are wasted. Yet there is a slight sense of unsatisfactory:  you would think more robots would be around. Though the desolation was probably crucial to engage the story as a fairy tale of these two. For what it is worth, Planetarian is a bitter-sweet detour. You can quickly become emotionally invested but also quickly become emotionally detached. Compare to key's later work, the build-up is fast and the period of agonizing is rather minmal. Of course the later can leave a deeper mark, but Planetarian will do plenty.","February 15, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First, it is very well delivered and memorable. Second, you WILL cry. Also for those with little or no VN experience, playing in a dark room with headphones strongly adds to the experience, by cutting out distraction.

You will cry. No really, I don't care if you're a hardened badass, if you honestly sit down and invest yourself in this story you will cry.\n\nThis is my first time ever experiencing a kenetic novel and only the second visual novel. This is a much more powerful format then I originally thought and I'm sad that I haven't been looking at them more seriously until now.\n\nSince theres already a lot of reviews helpful to those who are familier with the format and those explaining the story, I'm going to be talking to people who don't 'do' visual novel games. I was very skeptical of the format. I didn't see anything about them other then the taste-less demodisks sometimes toted around large conventions. You know the type I'm talking about. Please, give this style of game a chance. Between this game and Hatoful Boyfriend, I was shown this style in the light it was truly ment to be in.\n\nThis game isn't quite a book but it's not a game in the traditional sense. It's a game in the same way Dear Ester is a game. It's not about choices, theres no puzzles or combat. It's an experience, it's a story, and it's brillient at delivering that story. There is text to read, like a traditional novel, but the music helps set the tone like a movie would and the visuals help to really feel connected to the characters, both the one you 'play' as and Yumemi, the robot girl you meet.\n\nLike I said before, the game has an overall sad tone. If that's a problem for you, for whatever reason, I would understand you skipping this title. If you think you'll be okay though, PLEASE, do yourself a favor. Buy this game. Sit back and enjoy it. The whole thing in one sitting might take... oh 4 hours or so. If you can't do it all in one sitting theres a save function.\n\nJust... just give it a try.\n\nAll the stars in the sky are waiting for you.","January 23, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You will cry. No really, I don't care if you're a hardened badass, if you honestly sit down and invest yourself in this story you will cry.\n\nThis is my first time ever experiencing a kenetic novel and only the second visual novel. This is a much more powerful format then I originally thought and I'm sad that I haven't been looking at them more seriously until now.\n\nSince theres already a lot of reviews helpful to those who are familier with the format and those explaining the story, I'm going to be talking to people who don't 'do' visual novel games. I was very skeptical of the format. I didn't see anything about them other then the taste-less demodisks sometimes toted around large conventions. You know the type I'm talking about. Please, give this style of game a chance. Between this game and Hatoful Boyfriend, I was shown this style in the light it was truly ment to be in.\n\nThis game isn't quite a book but it's not a game in the traditional sense. It's a game in the same way Dear Ester is a game. It's not about choices, theres no puzzles or combat. It's an experience, it's a story, and it's brillient at delivering that story. There is text to read, like a traditional novel, but the music helps set the tone like a movie would and the visuals help to really feel connected to the characters, both the one you 'play' as and Yumemi, the robot girl you meet.\n\nLike I said before, the game has an overall sad tone. If that's a problem for you, for whatever reason, I would understand you skipping this title. If you think you'll be okay though, PLEASE, do yourself a favor. Buy this game. Sit back and enjoy it. The whole thing in one sitting might take... oh 4 hours or so. If you can't do it all in one sitting theres a save function.\n\nJust... just give it a try.\n\nAll the stars in the sky are waiting for you.","January 23, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game tugs at the heartstrings throughout, but the ending in particular is so sad that I have trouble thinking that anyone can read it without tears shed.\n\nIf you have any passing interest in Visual Novels, then I highly HIGHLY recommend this one.

The content was amazing and I cried many manly tears, but since this format was new to me and may be to others looking at this title, I'd like to do a quick rundown on the experience from a more technical standpoint.\n\nFirst, I've heard that some visual novels have branching story lines, mini games, and animation. Planetarian has none of these things, so feel free to set the auto advance to the speed you like and sit back for however long you have. I had the settings almost as fast as they go and it took about 4 hours from start to finish. Setting the auto-advance also means you won't accidentally skip any voiced lines that have a pause before they play on a slide.\n\nThere's enough text that the overall feeling was somewhere between reading a book and watching a movie. Mostly the narration is left out, but occasional character lines are not voiced. There are maybe 10 backgrounds and 30 character pictures that are shuffled around throughout the story, and while they're appealing enough, you really have to be engaged with the text or you won't enjoy yourself.\n\nBasically, this isn't a game, but I liked it. Consider watching it with friends on a TV if you want to get a little more out of the purchase.\n\nOh, and there are a few minor errors in the translation, but they weren't distracting and the meaning was intact.","June 7, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's by Key, so expect some feels and teary moments. That isn't to say it is the typical key affair though because its post apocalyptic setting and focus on a single platonic relationship between the protagonist and a robot set it apart from their other titles.\n\nIt's worth noting that it's a kinect novel, so there are no choices to be had and it is basically just a voiced story with images. Considering the short length however, this isn't really a draw back. It felt like no moments of the game were wasted filler, unlike most longer vns I've played, but it also didn't feel like things progressed too quickly. Basically, it has really good pacing that makes for an engrossing single sit read.\n\nGreat for those curious about the medium looking for a short read to try it out and for fans of key/vns in general.","June 8, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seffles/recommended/316720/","seffles","すみか","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seffles/","499 products in account","Overview:\n\nPlanetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet is a short Japanese kinetic visual novel from Key.  Anyone who knows visual novels knows Key.  They are one of the most respected studios out there, known for their amazing characters and touching stories.  Released on Steam just in time for the 10 year anniversary, how does Planetarian hold up?  The short answer?  Quite well.\n\nStory:\n\nPlanetarian is a simple story, set in a post-apocalyptic landscape.  The nature of the harsh world is hinted at throughout the experience, handing out bits and pieces of information regarding the reason for the fall of humanity and the harm we did to our own planet.  Our protagonist is a middle aged man known only as "The Junker."  He is a scavenger.  He lives by finding things to not only maintain his own survival but also by finding things of value within the ruins of humanity and bring them back to the various outposts and villages.  He even had a partner, at least for a while.\n\nThe story takes place in one of the "coffin cities," locations of horrible biological and germ warfare.  While avoiding automated war machines and searching for supplies, our protagonist heads deeper into the city interior, towards a dome shaped building.  Initially thinking it might be some type of military instillation he proceeds further only to discover that it is a department store (based off of the Matsubishi Department Store in Hamamatsu) with a planetarium at the top.  It is here that he meets Yumemi and Miss Jena.  What happens?  Who are these two characters?  Find out for yourself.\n\nBut to summarize the tale itself is heart breaking and very well written.  It can be a bit wordy at times but I personally feel that is part of the charm.  At a certain point you'll start to feel this sense of dread creeping up your spine and by the time our story reaches the climax and the scenes following you'll be reaching for something to dry your eyes.\n\nVisuals:\n\nThe visuals were beautiful when Planetarian released over ten years ago and they hold up to this date.  The sprites are gorgeous, the backgrounds, while simple, do a fantastic job of painting a bleak picture for a bleak world.  The only major issue I have is the resolution of the resources, which are a result of age, nothing more.  Despite being as old as it is Planetarian still looks great.\n\nSound Design:\n\nThe music is great.  Fantastic.  Designed to take a back seat to the visuals and the story, the various tracks fit the changing moods well.  At times whimsical and upbeat while or foreboding and downtrodden, it is honestly shocking how well it holds up.\n\nPlanetarian also features full voice acting, in Japanese.  The quality once again shows its age but is still well done.\n\nSystem:\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, and remembering the visual novel is more than 10 years old, it is functional but that is about as nice as I can be.  The font is...readable and everything functions the way it should...but it is old and it shows it.  Upon completion you will unlock the CG Gallery and Music Gallery.  They're expected but still nice little treats.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nIs Planetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet worth your time and money?  Absolutely.  It is a classic of the visual novel medium, the perfect length for the story it sets out to tell, and to this day still beautifully haunting.","January 28, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It looked cute. There was a good deal. Why not? I didn't know I was going to end up crying. Multiple times. Set in a post-apocalyptic world, the narrator is a "Junker" who goes through old scrap to survive in a deadly world where other living people are few and far between and unlikely to be friendly. He encounters a robot who was left behind in a planetarium 30 years ago when the war broke out and who has no idea nobody is ever coming back for her or will ever visit the planetarium again. If that premise isn't depressing enough, it's all downhill from there. But was it worth it? Absolutely. Somehow the writers are able to pluck out just the right refrains to repeat, the right choice of words to tug at your proverbial heart strings at the right moments.

I am not particularly into visual novels (I think this is the only one I've finished), so I can't really compare it to others. While the game feels padded with some unnecessary repetition at different points, it moved me like a video game hasn't moved me before. For some reason I can't explain, I really cared for the characters by the end (no, I'm not going to spoil anything). Part of it might the music, which I felt was superb.\n\nConclusion: I definitely recommend it if you are looking for a thought-provoking and emotional story. Be aware that it's a visual novel, so you make no choices and there is no "failure state." I'd also suggest doing it in one go (took me about four hours) for full effect.","August 3, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In this city he ends up inside an abandoned Planetarium, where he meets a robot named Yumemi. She offers a projection for him of the night sky, something he has never had the chance to see, and agrees to fix the broken projector in order to get that reward.\n\nThat's all the story summary I'll give, but suffice to say, it is quite good. However, I didn't really get very emotional until the last half-hour or so, but by then, I was most certainly bawling my eyes out. The main meat of the story is just the building relationship between the Junker and Yumemi, which is the only reason it works at all.\n\nIn terms of graphics and sound, the game is fine. I wouldn't really say the music is anything too special, especially not compared to Key's other Visual Novels, but it gives just the right atmosphere and mood for each scene, so that it's not really that much of a problem. Yumemi and the backgrounds are fairly well drawn and detailed, and the game is fully voiced (Japanese only).\n\nThe only big turn-off this game has is in it's length and asking price. As much as I recommend this story, $10 is a really steep price for something that lasts all of 3-5 hours with very little replay value. Granted, I'm the kind of guy who can read stuff like this multiple times, but I can't speak for others. I'd recommend waiting for a sale on this one, but whether you pay full-price or discounted, this experience is well worth it.","March 22","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Warning: if you have a heart, you will enjoy this adventure regardless of the price!\n\nKey is renowned for producing emotional VNs that tug on the heartstrings, supported by a good soundtrack, striking visuals and memorable characters that will stick with you long after you stop playing.  I can say that Planetarian fulfils all of those criteria in different ways.  There's just one difference: it's very short.  I'm quite an avid reader and can take a lot of narrative without a break, so I completed Planetarian in one 3 hour sitting.  I didn't race through it though; I paused for reflection and to enjoy the story at points.  However, if you're a slower reader or would prefer to enjoy the story in smaller bouts, you'll get more mileage out of it.\n\nConsidering the VN itself, I'm not going to lie - my immediate impression was 'oh, this is the VN Key put out as filler between bigger projects'.  The fonts are a little glitchy to read in places.  The visuals were slightly too pixellated on full screen mode - I had to switch to windowed to gain clarity.  And the soundtrack, for the most part, wasn't massively memorable, though it contributed to the atmosphere.  Sounds like a list of faults that make this VN probably not worth it, right?  That's not quite the whole story.\n\nDespite my original doubts about Planetarian, the more I read, I found myself getting sucked into the story at a rapid pace and becoming attached to its characters, of which there are few, but that just makes those who appear all that more compelling.  I won't mention plot points in case of spoilers, but the more your choiceless story moves uncontrollably towards a both heartbreaking and affirming end you knew might come, the more you feel.  There are no choices to make.  There is nothing you can do to affect the story.  You can't stop what's inevitably going to happen...  but when you reach that ending and consider the short journey you took to get there, you really feel things.  The fragility of the human world.  The stupidity power can inspire.  The beauty hidden within the things that are right there in front of your eyes...  yes, it's more like paying for a movie ticket rather than buying an interactive game, but I can promise you that you will feel things that will make you forget that ticket price.\n\nOkay, yes, it's probably a good idea to wait until this VN is on sale to make you feel a bit better about it...  but in all honesty, Planetarian began in my mind as a potential mistake, and turned into something I truly enjoyed and don't regret spending a single penny of that price for.  It was truly touching, like an anime you didn't expect to make you cry at the end...  oh, did I mention you might cry?  Yeah, it's a possibility.  I TOTALLY didn't , of course.  *cough*\n\nSummary:  Begins in a way that doesn't promise much, but within five minutes, sucks you in and delivers a heartfelt, honest and moving little tale you'll be glad to experience.  Nice visuals, with lots of movement in the CGs, which is rare for VNs at times - gives you a break from static sprites on static backgrounds.  Soundtrack appears rather average until you're hit with the beautiful vocal-laden dream of a song at the end.\n\nOnly real drawback?  You might start Googling around for the nearest planetarium when you're done.","February 11","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was drawn in from the very beginning. I loved the sound effects, the references to the rain and the foreshadowing was all very well done. The artwork was good, and helped to tell the story, especially when combined with the sound effects.\n\nThe story is beautiful, and very poignant. WIthout revealing too much, it's a nice discussion about the ambitions and flaws of humanity. There is a very fitting score for the game, which fits the mood of the various settings, and really helps tell the story.\n\nBeing a Visual Novel, there isn't anything to say regarding gameplay or controls - you just click your way through. The interface is easy enough to navigate and saving your game is easy. I played this with the steam controller - as it meant I could sit in bed and play. Anything you use to click your way through is fine.\n\nThe VN does an excellent job of giving backstory, and building up characters and their relationships.. It's also very effective at setting a tone of isolation. I absolutely enjoyed this VN and it pressed all the right buttons for me.

It's by Key, so expect some feels and teary moments. That isn't to say it is the typical key affair though because its post apocalyptic setting and focus on a single platonic relationship between the protagonist and a robot set it apart from their other titles.\n\nIt's worth noting that it's a kinect novel, so there are no choices to be had and it is basically just a voiced story with images. Considering the short length however, this isn't really a draw back. It felt like no moments of the game were wasted filler, unlike most longer vns I've played, but it also didn't feel like things progressed too quickly. Basically, it has really good pacing that makes for an engrossing single sit read.\n\nGreat for those curious about the medium looking for a short read to try it out and for fans of key/vns in general.","June 8, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seffles/recommended/316720/","seffles","すみか","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seffles/","499 products in account","Overview:\n\nPlanetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet is a short Japanese kinetic visual novel from Key.  Anyone who knows visual novels knows Key.  They are one of the most respected studios out there, known for their amazing characters and touching stories.  Released on Steam just in time for the 10 year anniversary, how does Planetarian hold up?  The short answer?  Quite well.\n\nStory:\n\nPlanetarian is a simple story, set in a post-apocalyptic landscape.  The nature of the harsh world is hinted at throughout the experience, handing out bits and pieces of information regarding the reason for the fall of humanity and the harm we did to our own planet.  Our protagonist is a middle aged man known only as "The Junker."  He is a scavenger.  He lives by finding things to not only maintain his own survival but also by finding things of value within the ruins of humanity and bring them back to the various outposts and villages.  He even had a partner, at least for a while.\n\nThe story takes place in one of the "coffin cities," locations of horrible biological and germ warfare.  While avoiding automated war machines and searching for supplies, our protagonist heads deeper into the city interior, towards a dome shaped building.  Initially thinking it might be some type of military instillation he proceeds further only to discover that it is a department store (based off of the Matsubishi Department Store in Hamamatsu) with a planetarium at the top.  It is here that he meets Yumemi and Miss Jena.  What happens?  Who are these two characters?  Find out for yourself.\n\nBut to summarize the tale itself is heart breaking and very well written.  It can be a bit wordy at times but I personally feel that is part of the charm.  At a certain point you'll start to feel this sense of dread creeping up your spine and by the time our story reaches the climax and the scenes following you'll be reaching for something to dry your eyes.\n\nVisuals:\n\nThe visuals were beautiful when Planetarian released over ten years ago and they hold up to this date.  The sprites are gorgeous, the backgrounds, while simple, do a fantastic job of painting a bleak picture for a bleak world.  The only major issue I have is the resolution of the resources, which are a result of age, nothing more.  Despite being as old as it is Planetarian still looks great.\n\nSound Design:\n\nThe music is great.  Fantastic.  Designed to take a back seat to the visuals and the story, the various tracks fit the changing moods well.  At times whimsical and upbeat while or foreboding and downtrodden, it is honestly shocking how well it holds up.\n\nPlanetarian also features full voice acting, in Japanese.  The quality once again shows its age but is still well done.\n\nSystem:\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, and remembering the visual novel is more than 10 years old, it is functional but that is about as nice as I can be.  The font is...readable and everything functions the way it should...but it is old and it shows it.  Upon completion you will unlock the CG Gallery and Music Gallery.  They're expected but still nice little treats.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nIs Planetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet worth your time and money?  Absolutely.  It is a classic of the visual novel medium, the perfect length for the story it sets out to tell, and to this day still beautifully haunting.","January 28, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was drawn in from the very beginning. I loved the sound effects, the references to the rain and the foreshadowing was all very well done. The artwork was good, and helped to tell the story, especially when combined with the sound effects.\n\nThe story is beautiful, and very poignant. WIthout revealing too much, it's a nice discussion about the ambitions and flaws of humanity. There is a very fitting score for the game, which fits the mood of the various settings, and really helps tell the story.\n\nBeing a Visual Novel, there isn't anything to say regarding gameplay or controls - you just click your way through. The interface is easy enough to navigate and saving your game is easy. I played this with the steam controller - as it meant I could sit in bed and play. Anything you use to click your way through is fine.\n\nThe VN does an excellent job of giving backstory, and building up characters and their relationships.. It's also very effective at setting a tone of isolation. I absolutely enjoyed this VN and it pressed all the right buttons for me. After I finished the story last night, I felt very quiet and reflective. Emotions abound.\n\nSimply superb.","March 5","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In this city he ends up inside an abandoned Planetarium, where he meets a robot named Yumemi. She offers a projection for him of the night sky, something he has never had the chance to see, and agrees to fix the broken projector in order to get that reward.\n\nThat's all the story summary I'll give, but suffice to say, it is quite good. However, I didn't really get very emotional until the last half-hour or so, but by then, I was most certainly bawling my eyes out. The main meat of the story is just the building relationship between the Junker and Yumemi, which is the only reason it works at all.\n\nIn terms of graphics and sound, the game is fine. I wouldn't really say the music is anything too special, especially not compared to Key's other Visual Novels, but it gives just the right atmosphere and mood for each scene, so that it's not really that much of a problem. Yumemi and the backgrounds are fairly well drawn and detailed, and the game is fully voiced (Japanese only).\n\nThe only big turn-off this game has is in it's length and asking price. As much as I recommend this story, $10 is a really steep price for something that lasts all of 3-5 hours with very little replay value. Granted, I'm the kind of guy who can read stuff like this multiple times, but I can't speak for others. I'd recommend waiting for a sale on this one, but whether you pay full-price or discounted, this experience is well worth it.","March 22","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am not particularly into visual novels (I think this is the only one I've finished), so I can't really compare it to others. While the game feels padded with some unnecessary repetition at different points, it moved me like a video game hasn't moved me before. For some reason I can't explain, I really cared for the characters by the end (no, I'm not going to spoil anything). Part of it might the music, which I felt was superb.\n\nConclusion: I definitely recommend it if you are looking for a thought-provoking and emotional story. Be aware that it's a visual novel, so you make no choices and there is no "failure state."

It looked cute. There was a good deal. Why not? I didn't know I was going to end up crying. Multiple times. Set in a post-apocalyptic world, the narrator is a "Junker" who goes through old scrap to survive in a deadly world where other living people are few and far between and unlikely to be friendly. He encounters a robot who was left behind in a planetarium 30 years ago when the war broke out and who has no idea nobody is ever coming back for her or will ever visit the planetarium again. If that premise isn't depressing enough, it's all downhill from there. But was it worth it? Absolutely. Somehow the writers are able to pluck out just the right refrains to repeat, the right choice of words to tug at your proverbial heart strings at the right moments.

Warning: if you have a heart, you will enjoy this adventure regardless of the price!\n\nKey is renowned for producing emotional VNs that tug on the heartstrings, supported by a good soundtrack, striking visuals and memorable characters that will stick with you long after you stop playing.  I can say that Planetarian fulfils all of those criteria in different ways.  There's just one difference: it's very short.  I'm quite an avid reader and can take a lot of narrative without a break, so I completed Planetarian in one 3 hour sitting.  I didn't race through it though; I paused for reflection and to enjoy the story at points.  However, if you're a slower reader or would prefer to enjoy the story in smaller bouts, you'll get more mileage out of it.\n\nConsidering the VN itself, I'm not going to lie - my immediate impression was 'oh, this is the VN Key put out as filler between bigger projects'.  The fonts are a little glitchy to read in places.  The visuals were slightly too pixellated on full screen mode - I had to switch to windowed to gain clarity.  And the soundtrack, for the most part, wasn't massively memorable, though it contributed to the atmosphere.  Sounds like a list of faults that make this VN probably not worth it, right?  That's not quite the whole story.\n\nDespite my original doubts about Planetarian, the more I read, I found myself getting sucked into the story at a rapid pace and becoming attached to its characters, of which there are few, but that just makes those who appear all that more compelling.  I won't mention plot points in case of spoilers, but the more your choiceless story moves uncontrollably towards a both heartbreaking and affirming end you knew might come, the more you feel.  There are no choices to make.  There is nothing you can do to affect the story.  You can't stop what's inevitably going to happen...  but when you reach that ending and consider the short journey you took to get there, you really feel things.  The fragility of the human world.  The stupidity power can inspire.  The beauty hidden within the things that are right there in front of your eyes...  yes, it's more like paying for a movie ticket rather than buying an interactive game, but I can promise you that you will feel things that will make you forget that ticket price.\n\nOkay, yes, it's probably a good idea to wait until this VN is on sale to make you feel a bit better about it...  but in all honesty, Planetarian began in my mind as a potential mistake, and turned into something I truly enjoyed and don't regret spending a single penny of that price for.  It was truly touching, like an anime you didn't expect to make you cry at the end...  oh, did I mention you might cry?  Yeah, it's a possibility.  I TOTALLY didn't , of course.  *cough*\n\nSummary:  Begins in a way that doesn't promise much, but within five minutes, sucks you in and delivers a heartfelt, honest and moving little tale you'll be glad to experience.  Nice visuals, with lots of movement in the CGs, which is rare for VNs at times - gives you a break from static sprites on static backgrounds.  Soundtrack appears rather average until you're hit with the beautiful vocal-laden dream of a song at the end.\n\nOnly real drawback?  You might start Googling around for the nearest planetarium when you're done.","February 11","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However the story give such an emotional suckerpunch that i can honeslty say that its very much worth it to check out.

It must have been because I couldn\'t write because I was crying a lot after I finished it. (and I don\'t cry easily from media anymore)\nIt\'s a beautiful story, slow moving, which lets you really feel connected to the scenario and characters.\n\nIt\'s a kinetic novel which means there are no split endings or collecting to do, it is all one story, which I read finished in about 5 hours.\n\nI really recommend it!\nIt\'s pretty cheap and made by Key so you know it\'s going to be good. :P\nAnd there is an anime coming now too, so it is exciting to see the adaption of this visual novel, I hope it\'s well made!","June 1","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cb007r/recommended/316720/","cb007r","CB007","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cb007r/","540 products in account","A sweet, sad kintetic novel about a strange encounter set during essentially the end of the world. It's strange how some stories really resonate with you and some don't. I did feel some sadness during this novel but at the same time, it didn't quite work for me either. Yumemi is more than just a machine, but the way she's written, I didn't reach the point where it felt she was truly alive, either. It could even be something that didn't quite come through in the translation but that was just my overall sense of it. The story is about 4 hours long, give or take a little bit depending on your reading speed. I happened to leave it running by mistake. This is not a story to make you feel any great happiness at any point so if you have an aversion to melancholy stories you might want to stay away. Otherwise, it's definitely still worth reading if you like visual novels. PS- Make sure you right click and change the font from the default if you are seeing overlapping letters.","June 5","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
