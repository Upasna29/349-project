It wasn't designed for racing, yeah it had a racing storyline on the side, but coming from TDU1, it was all about driving around a beautiful island with your friends calmly and enjoying the scenery.\n\nSo if you are looking for a game where you drive to 3 million miles an hour crashing at every corner, go play need for speed. But if you're looking for that one game you actually enjoy doing nothing but driving around on... this is for you.\n\nMost underated driving game of all time.\nIf I had to choose my most favorite driving game... this would be No. 1.\n\nps. dont be fooled by the small amount of hours I have on steam, I have over 500 on my xbox.","October 17, 2014","true","26.9"," 519 of 569 people (91%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","91","519","569","19","28"

Tdu2 'a world in a game', a game that many people have called terrible, (maybe they need to try a bit more with happy face,\nmaybe try more, persist, and learn it.)

Hurray!\n---\nAtari broke my Steam Tdu2 last July 23rd 2013. no support atari said tell Steam, Steam said go tell Atari. So I had to buy it again, I now play in retail Tdu2, same game but play hours are not recorded.\nTdu2 single player is [imho] 95% at super excellent; more after my word on multiplayer.\nTDU2 had its multiplayer peak in 2011 [2,000 average number of players online each day] and was excellent and seamless join from singleplay and support was good. Since then Atari went broke, sacked its Eden devs and try to maintain and code and 'update' it by themselves and they have failed  breaking much of the multi and have even broken some of the login process and Uplauncher. Support is not much after 3 years.  Many forum posts complain about not being able to get past the uplauncher into the multi game. If you do manage to set router firewall exceptions for port 8889 and 3478 [not so simple] then you will mostly get into multi ok and all will be good.\n\nBackup your Savegame every day.. that's Documents\Eden Games. Copy the whole folder, find a safe place on other drive, create a new folder, name it as e.g. 'May12-ellie-lev22' Open it, and Paste in there. Ok. Do that every day, make new folder each time with new name, e.g. 'May13-ellie....etc. after a week you have 7 backups of your Eden Games, you can delete the oldest one, you still got 6. My backup folder, if it gets more than 50 in it I delete a few, but I always keep the most recent 5.  If your Tdu2 gives error or crashes, go Documents, Cut the Eden Games folder, Paste it to Desktop, Open the recent backup folder you made, Copy  (not Cut) that Eden Games folder and Paste it in Documents. Run Uplauncher all good say Hurray for backup, delete that bad Eden from Desktop, go Play. If still fail ask for helps.\nThanks for reading. Have fun!\nThanks Atari Eden for creating Tdu2.","November 26, 2013","true","392.6"," 658 of 735 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","658","735","2","21"

How did it come to this? For the longest time I was just another loser, content with a mundane life and those brief moments of escapism. Somehow over the course of nearly 30 hours in Test Drive Unlimited 2, I became a monster.\n\nSometimes when people play videogames, it's to get away, like a virtual vacation. But there are those times, where I don't want to be a plumber, a rodent with an attitude, a criminal, or Laura Bailey. I just want to drive around in expensive automobiles. In the real world I own two cars, one of them has a busted alternator. The other? No brakes. Despite being unable to start or stop, I've maintained the same driving job for the past decade. I'm always driving through the same neighborhoods meeting the same people every moment of every day. On top of all that, if Florida is considered America's ♥♥♥♥, then I live in one of its hemorrhoids. But hey, all I need is an hour or two a day of wonderfully escapist adventures and I'm golden.\n\nI was a fan of Test Drive Unlimited 1 on the Xbox 360. The handling wasn't particularly good, but the atmosphere and sense of exploration was excellent. With a few fixes, better graphics, and more content, it could be my ideal driving game. I'm not sure what I was expecting with the sequel. I read all of the reviews, noted that there are major problems such as Securom, dysfunctional servers, and so on. I considered the possibility that this game might not even work. But I gave it a shot anyway...\n\n...I'm at a party...alright..cool I guess. Apparently I'm a woman now. It's just like Skyrim except I'm wearing clothes and I don't think I have a six-foot-long p-.\n"PepsimanVsJoe! Enjoying your birthday party?"\nOh It's my birthday? I had no idea. Apparently I'm a silent-protagonist so all I can do is smile.\n"Come check out your gift! It's a brand new car!"\nNo way! This is one of those end-game vehicles. I must be dreaming. This is so totally meta.\n\nSure enough the real game begins, I lose my job, only to get an offer to join a racing group for some show called Solar Crown. This is so ridiculous. I head to the used car dealer for my first actual virtual vehicle.\n\n"HOLY ♥♥♥♥!" I say to myself.\nThe dealer? He has small hands. The driving school instructor? A regular Alex Smith. It's no wonder none of them have gone for a handshake, it would be like if I held up my finger so a baby could grab it. After sleep-driving through my first test I say "Thank you very much." to the instructor. Apparently I'm a very-thankful-and-not-quite-silent protagonist. The only words I ever say are to express gratitude.\n\nOn the road, the handling is...well it's about as bad as TDU1. In my mind that's good enough, because I'm finally living the dream again, cruising through hundreds of miles of beautiful Ibiza, and eventually Hawaii. As with the previous game, everyone needs help getting around the islands. There's the drunk guy who wants me to speed, the sick girls that throw up if I slam on the brakes, the random woman who always calls me adorable, and...wait a minute. It's happening again isn't it? The same people, requesting me to do the same favors for them over and over. Don't they have anything to say? While I'm driving we could discuss those bonus features on DVDs, or what tiny-handed men are good for aside from making origami birds out of starburst wrappers. Instead it's always "I'm going to be late!" or "I just broke a nail" or "Whoa ho! Look at that speed!"\n\nThe people I compete with are slightly more developed, but it's also a facade. Miami Harris is little more than an untimely Paris Hilton joke. Then there's the Wilder brothers. Oh look at us! We're so extreme...ly shallow! Tess Wintory never figures out her daddy issues. Her dad Stuart is just a useless old prick. If I'm expected to race against these jerks all the time, at least a little effort could have been expended to develop them. But who am I to talk? I have the least character development of all. Oh sure, I've bought several houses, over a dozen cars, and a couple wardrobes. I've also gotten plastic surgery so many times I've forgotten what I originally looked like. In fact I just got some work done earlier today. The nose wasn't right.\n\nAside from a few minor changes and additions, TDU2 isn't really much of a sequel. In some ways it's even a step back. Motorcycles are locked behind a DLC wall. The races are organized in a Grand Prix setup, with the winner being the person who attains the most points. However that model is dumped for the major championships races because....???? It doesn't make any sense. A casino would have been nice to hang out at, but that's also DLC. All of the other additions seem to be multiplayer-centric, which is pointless when half the people that buy this game can't even get it to work.\n\nBut does any of that truly matter to me? I got what I wanted right? My virtual fantasy of owning expensive cars, several houses (that I can't interact with), and free reign over a beautiful...but lifeless island. Lifeless except for the same 12-15 idiots who sit around impotently while I drive them around or beat them to the ground in the championships. Nearly 30 hours of this dream has become a nightmare, and I suspect that it won't end anytime soon.\n\nSo where we did leave off? Oh right...I was hurtling over the tallest cliff in Hawaii. Yes, I'm throwing it all away. Soon it will all be-\n\nI hit the rocks, then the water...suddenly I'm back on the road again...my car is a little scratched but it isn't even wet. I knew it wouldn't work anyway, but can you blame me for trying?\nIt's that time again. I remove the bandages from my last trip under the knife and check the rear-view mirror.\n\nThe nose still isn't right.","January 12, 2015","false","28.6"," 567 of 713 people (80%) found this review helpful 527 people found this review funny","80","567","713","527","22"

Graphics were dated, even upon release. The car handling is vague and unresponsive, even on hardcore mode. The story is awful. The character models and voice acting is even worse. The car list is diverse if you enjoy European cars, but terribly lacking for Japanese and American models. Buying cars can be a grinding task of repetition. Buying houses is worse. There are countless glitches. Online support ceased years ago.\n\nHowever, even will all it's flaws, I this is still one of my favorite games. The expansive roads of Ibiza AND Oahu are amazing. 2 massive islands that will takes you countless hours to explore. The maps are really the key gameplay elements. Once you adjust to the vague controls, there is a true sense of speed when cruising through the mountains, or beaches, or canyons, or through the city. Though games like Forza Horizon do offer a better overall experiance. TDU2 offers true driving freedom.\n\nEven with the dated graphics, this game can be truely beautiful. With all the houses and cars on offer, this will give an avid car fan who needs to collect everything hours upon hours of fun.\n\nIgnore the garbage story, accept the dated graphics, adapt to the steering ambiguity, and you have one of the most fun sandbox driving games available.","December 29, 2015","true","46.1"," 85 of 98 people (87%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","87","85","98","11","0"

Check server status and the store News page in case there are any issues.\nNo issues?\n- If you can find 0 issues then it is more than likely the ports are being blocked somewhere, it’s actually really easy to tell if the ports are being blocked! The launcher tells you this! If the ports are blocked the text above the loader bar will be in red; if it is in RED then please search up on Google on how to open TDU2 ports (Skill Level: Moderate), this should take you no longer than 10 minutes to do this TIP: try portforarding.com they have a really handy tool that helps you get started.\nIf you know the ports are open inside your router, it’s time you checked your firewalls! If you have windows firewall (as rubbish as it is) you need to allow the application access to the internet usually automatically prompts you to do this on first launch, secondly you need to free up the TDU’s ports as well.\nOk when you launch the game the launcher will come up, if you still see the RED text then don’t worry it’s just a minor bug; all you need to do is close the launcher and re-open the game (this may take a few attempts) you are looking for GREEN text, if you have tried at least 10 times:\nFirstly restart your Router and your PC then revert to the above ^^ statement.\n\nWindows 10:\nWindows 10 at first load up appears that it does not support the game; It pops up with the readme.htm file telling you that the game is not supported, however there is a way around this! First of all close the game.\n-- Those of you who do not know what Troubleshooting compatibility is, search up for some helpful tips on Google! :) –\n- Yes you guessed it! You are going to be using Compatibility to get the game working, note: you only need to do this once!\nFirstly: goto your game library, locate TDU2, right click the game and select Properties, goto the Local files tab, click Browse local files\nSecondly: Locate these 2 files: TestDrive2.exe and UpLauncher.exe. Right-click each one separately, click on “Troubleshoot Compatibility”, click “Troubleshoot program”, check “The program worked in earlier versions of Windows but won’t install or run now” -> click next, Select Windows 8 -> click Next, click “Test the program...” (needed to save the new settings) -> close the app after it opens -> Click next, click “Yes, save the settings for this program” -> Click “Close”.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/voaz/recommended/9930/","voaz","Voaz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/voaz/","666 products in account","Hello and welcome to my review of the relatively old game Test Drive Unlimited 2.\nI am aware of the fact that the game was released in 2011, I've purchased it in 2013 and I will still review this title because the series are discontinued and I do still enjoy the game untill today.\n\nNow something about me regarding the racing genre on PC.\nI do not like racing games where you can race on a track, in a car which is almost unhandle-able ( in my opinion, ofcourse ).\nWith these games I mean Grid, and partially Dirt.\n\nOkay, I did enjoy Dirt 3 and Dirt Showdown without a doubt but in the end, playing with a controller or a steering wheel, it didn't satisfy me enough to keep me playing these titles once in a week or more often.\n\nSo now back to what I do enjoy in a game of the racing genre.\nI do really like the open-world idea, having a big map or several maps ( In Test Drive's case: Island ).\nDriving around without anything forcing you do to anything, making speed and just drive all across the island on various landscapes with a nice sight does satisfiy me.\n\nBuying a relaxing car, my Ferrari 458 Italia, Purple with black rims in this case: And just cruising around the island, on the roads with water to the right of me and the city to the left of me, hearing the engine doing it's work is what I like.\n\nNot being forced to drive a track, do a race and aiming on finishing first without anything else you can do.\nJust free-roaming in open worlds with customizable cars which you can upgrade and adjust to any specification you want.\n\nAnd that's for the driving part, now for the experience in terms of sound.\n\nThe sound of the car, in various situations ( Driving in sand, dirt, or just a normal road ).\nThe sound is different every time, for every car in any situations ( weather too for example ) is just perfect in the game and these small things help me enjoy the game more than I already did.\nDriving through a tunnel while It's raining in my custom white Nissan GT-R is what I can't do in any other game.\nAnd these elements of Test Drive is what makes me want to play the game, the endless options to tune and adjust cars to exactly how I'd like to and then going on the road, hearing the right sound and feeling good when playing the game .. Yeah, that;\n\nNow for the other part of the game:\nMissions, Money, Houses and avatar.\n\nMissions in Test Drive are tasks you have to complete which can be anything from getting a high adrenaline bar, but also could be driving above a certain speed and also opposite missions like driving really careful without the person next to you in the car getting sick.\n\nThese missions are pretty fun for the first few times but become boring quick, but they reward you with money to buy cars, houses and clothing.\n\nMoney in the game is pretty important ofcourse but I feel like you just have to keep grinding the repetitive missions to finally buy the car you have been wanting for a while.\n\nSo yeah, the method of money making within the game is something I don't like and that made me want to Cheatengine myself a couple houndred million instead of working for the money I want to buy the car I'd like.\n\nHouses and Avatar: Besides the garage part to store your cars, I don't care about Houses or pimping your avatar ( Buying clothes, getting haircuts, etc ).\n\nSo yup, the car driving part is what I like the most of the game.\n\nOkay, for some of you I might have not played the game in the right way, or not long enough but this was my final review of the game.\n\nIf I had to give the game a score from 0 to 100 I would give it a 85, some aspects could've been done way better ( Money making and missions ) but the driving itself is what makes the game a good open-world cruising game, and pretty unique in it's genre.\nOkay okay, Grand Theft Auto is somewhat more bigger and to some also better but what I care about is the car driving.\nIn Grand Theft Auto the car driving is only fun when stunting and such with your friends.\n\nSo that's it for the review guys, I hope you have enjoyed reading my opinion about this game.","April 8, 2014","true","32.1"," 75 of 86 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","75","86","0","1"

Singleplayer quickly puts you up to task, teaching you how the system works: get licenses, complete races, get cars, customize cars, complete championships, buy houses, buy furniture, get bigger garages and then buy more cars. The map is huge, its fun to explore, Hell!, its fun to just pick a random car and drive around the island, for some it's even therapy and it works just fine!...at least the singleplayer.\n\nMultiplayer mode is not so multiplayer, constant connection problems logs you out of the game, some players might have their cars shaking on your screen due to connection issues, and 'clubs' which are the "guilds" in this racing game, as mostly not used by anyone, believe me... I've tried.\n\nAfter learning not to mind the bad physic system and buying an Xbox Controller so I could play it not so terribly, I find myself enjoying this game very much, there is even a chasing mode which reminded me of the old need for speed games.Once again, It's a fine game, despite its flaws, I do recommend Test Drive Unlimited 2 for any racing games lover.\n\ntl;dr\n+ Great amount of vehicles\n+ Huge map, fun to explore\n+ Immserive Atmosphere\n+ Plenty of things to do\n\n- Bikes are DLC only\n- Connection and launcher problems\n- Driving physics feel clumsy\n- Menus for social interactions are not user-friendly","December 3, 2013","true","64.6"," 107 of 136 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","107","136","0","0"

It is know that this game wasn't tested properly before launch and atari even released some free DLC to compensate for that but the truth is that the AI is horrible, the police chase mode is dreadful and the god damn license tests annoying. What this game does good however is cruising with friends or alone. And it does it damn well. The cars are lovely, the graphics maybe a little outdated but not bad at all and the island large enough for hours of exploring and fun.\n\nIf you're ooking for an actual racing simulator go elsewhere. This is more of an arcadish casual driving game. Personally i enjoy the off-roading the most. Going 250km/h in a beautiful Mercedes ML63 AMG on the dirt drifiting around a corner is fun.\n\nDo note that eden games (the creator of this game) is gone so theres no more support for it really. And the servers tend to go down at times. Great game, worth the money.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ticky/recommended/9930/","ticky","Ticky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ticky/","298 products in account","I've poured a significant chunk of time into this game, and as far as I can tell, it was all a bit of a waste.\n\nThis game appears, from the screenshots and trailer, to be a relatively straightforward driving sim, with an ambitious goal of giving you hundreds of kilometers of road to drive on, and loads of cars. It certainly delivers on giving you a beautiful and detailed set of cars (There's geometry in the stitched leather of my Alfa Romeo's dashboard, for goodness' sake!), and an enormous amount of road to play with them on.\n\nUnfortunately, it suffers in a few fairly glaring areas.\n\nArea 1: Voice "Acting"\n\nThere is a serious problem with the way the voice actors were either directed or hired, as the voice acting cannot be more irritating, repetitive and off-key. The dialogue is pretty awful, and the "story" which attempts to make an excuse for you entering loads of "championships" consisting of the same eight or so opponents would have been better off dropped from the game.\n\n(Additionally, if you don't play with a male character, prepare to be perpetually misgendered as they only recorded dialogue using masculine pronouns.)\n\nArea 2: DLC Hell\n\nThe game is littered with "DLC" cars which you can gawk at in full detail, get in, and test drive, but which, as far as I can tell, cost Atari Points to unlock the privilege of purchasing with in-game currency. Good work guys.\n\nAlso, about 40% of the customisation options for your character, houses and vehicles are literally unrelated Atari logos and trademarks. What a load of crap.\n\nArea 3: Physics\n\nI wouldn't call myself an expert in car handling or physics, I don't have real-life racing experience, the closest I could say I've come is playing a reasonable amount of Gran Turismo, and driving a fairly mundane vehicle around city streets IRL, but to call the physics in Test Drive Unlimited 2 uninviting would be an understatement.\n\nSo yes, I'm expecting some oversteer and some understeer, maybe if I turn driving aids off I'm expecting to have to pay a little more attention to how I accelerate and steer. Fine.\n\nBut don't make a game where the vehicle's reaction to the road seems to be dependent on my camera position. Cars have literally flipped backwards after a crest when in cockpit camera, but don't do so from behind. I can only assume that it puts priority on physics objects which are in your view? Makes no damned sense.\n\nLikewise, cars feel very detached from the road. There's a definite difference in grip between bitumen and grass, which is fair enough, but cars still slide (forwards) on the tarmac. There's also a "bonus" system for "drifting", though "drifting" doesn't appear to actually be possible due to the game's physics setup. I gave up on that mechanic.\n\nArea 4: AI\n\nWhen in a time trial style event, with just your vehicle on the track, the time to beat is just barely attainable if you make 0 mistakes, and pretty much impossible if you mess up even once.\n\nMeanwhile, in a race with multiple vehicles on the road, your opponents drive like your grandmother going to pick up groceries. They weave in and out of corners in a perfect row with no apparent intent to win. If you do get ahead of them, you can simply slow down in front of them, they won't attempt to overtake and break their racing line at all. Completely stupid. If you're going to ask me to win races, at least make it a challenge rather than wasting my time like this.\n\nConclusion\n\nFriends don't let friends buy Atari products.\n\nHow I Played\n\n* Female Character\n* Microsoft Xbox 360 Wireless Controller with genuine Microsoft controller adaptor\n* @1920x1200 on a GTX260 (Earlier)\n* @2560x1440 on a GTX670\n* Did not purchase any offered DLC\n* Attempted to use the Unofficial Patch, but unpacking negatively affected ongoing game performance","December 21, 2013","false","35.1"," 229 of 365 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","229","365","0","10"

The physics are just terrible. This is not even a matter for debate- check any review from when this was released. Regardless of of car class or cost, the cars handle poorly in general and have an unreasonable tendency to easily spin out of control even on dry roads.\n\n2. Server Authentication. TDU2 has 'online' and 'offline' player profiles- think Diablo 2 with offline and Battle.net characters. These are completely separate saves and you cannot transfer progression from one to the other. The problem is, the Online Servers are constantly down for PC, meaning you cannot use your Online profile.

I'll Just get to the point and use the pro/con format. At the end I'll make observations and make an summation.\n\nPros. 1. Attention to detail was given to layout* and overall very detailed citys and villages including ancient ruins with no purpose but as a nice touch. 2. Behavior of npc opponents during races  created challenge. 3. A large selection of vechicles was available. 4. RPG features such as clothing/car appearence and preformance/housing/player alteration was abundant. 5. Basic driving fundamentals (driving schools) available and mandatory to advance.\n\nCons. 1. Layout* and NPC behavior. While driving around "most" any curve while offroad at moderately high speed and you want to get sideways a bit? Rest assured that your entrance and exit of the curve has been carefully calculated and a tree has been placed at the exact center of your exit position and sometimes 2 to catch you just in case you swerve away from the first. Want to cut corners where you wish? No. You'll find carefully placed trees at most curves. Think you're clearing that tree? Nope. Suddenly you've rammed that tree head on exactly centered by your vechicle. You'll cut corners where you're allowed to and only in matches where they're obvious to the player. 2. NPC driving behavior.  While driving an 4 lane highway your forced to drive on the shoulder because as you approach 2 npc vechicles one will speed to tandem with the other closing an opening that you saw from a distance. Also say you're in an eight lane highway and want to open up the throttle? No. If any vechicle exists in the road ahead it will change lanes to be in yours.  Its 2 am in the middle of nowhere and you get a lead foot?  Vechicles will pop into existence before your very eyes in both lanes.\nApproaching an intersection at high speed? cars will race to block sometimes intersecting and crashing while you're attempting to navigate. Driving through the mountains? And approaching a curve?  NPC vechicles will pop into existance race to the curve to beat you there then slow down to 20 mph entering the curve. You want to pass on a curve but dont want to use the shoulder? Consider that all curves are completely blind to you and that an NPC vechicle will pop into existance in the opposing lane as you pass. Want to get close to the vechicle in front of you to get a good passing position? It will slam on the brakes.\n\n2. Graphics.  Microstuttering, visible jerking, tearing of the world ahead. Also textures blinking in and out of existence on NPC vechicles. And no its not my computer. It can handle Planetside 2 at 60 fps no problem.\n\n3. NPC while out of vechicles look worse than any in half-life 2 ever did.\n\n4. Voice acting that that never varies and grates the nerves.\n\n5. Want to use a keyboard to navigate? Hehe.\n\n6. Getting some progress in the game? Nope your save game in corrupted.\n\n7. Want to play online? Ha ha...\n\n8. Need support? (see above)\n\n9. Waiting for an update. (see above X2)\n\n10.  Want a certain car? Tough luck, its DLC.\n\n\nWhile fun can be had it seems engineered to annoy the player enough to quit playing while making a DLC purchase at the same exact moment.","November 20, 2014","false","10.5"," 65 of 103 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","65","103","5","1"

Interesting story... no, great driving physics...no, interesting characters.. dont let me start on that, voice acting?.. you could say that if you were entertained by the repeating announcement that apparently the Wilder brother are squabbling with Stewart again (who-tf is Stewart I can only guess).\n\nHowever this game has something. You have you car and the freedom to travel around two islands full of nice sights and sunny vistas. You can drive for hours, buy cars, houses or just explore at your leasure.  You can challenge other people whos worlds seamlesly intersect with yours like in Dark Souls. Or you can explore the world without invisible bounds around the roads, a bit like Skyrim in Cars. But even if you stop, the environment doesn't look as generic as for example in Need for Speed or Driver series, so you are really motivated to visit new places.\n\nThe graphics are great, there is a weather and day/night cycle. The views you get out of some of your Flats/Houses are amasing. The challenges a varied and exciting. There are also a pair of races around the Island, that can take nearly a real-world hour to complete. I mean if I think about it a bit more, this game is the opposite of what I really don't like about other racing games whith dumb driving on the same track over and over again with an extreme example being american Nascar where you just drive in a circle.\n\nSure the characters look like dorks and sound even worse, but then you see the attention do detail the developers put into the game and it's amazing.  Just try to explore the starting location. You will not see it any more after the first minute or so in-game but the effort put into it speaks for itself. If you take your time and look around at the nicely textured babes, whose breast actually bounce around a bit (in a racing game!), the bar with actually some bottles stuffed behind the counter, then you really get into this holiday Ibiza mood. Did I mention  I really appreciate that detail? There are also many cars each with detailed interior, which you can admire.\nThis game however is not without its (many) problems, to name a few:\n- the characters are just plain silly and the story even more so\n- you have to set the controls just so, or the driving experience will be awfull\n- the driving physics could be much better (I miss dirt 2)\n- there are no pedestrians (to drive over :)  ) anywhere!\n- the developer is not in business any more\nWell thats my 2c, you can get this game really cheap for less tha $10 on steamtrades, so if you just like to drive around, explore and do an occasional race, this is a game for you!\n\nP.S. The Characters in this game are ridiculous and remind me of mega shark vs giant octopus movie. They either creep you out, like the same guy you pick at 2 am in car who is "late for his meeting" or make you laugh hystericly because their dialogs dont correspond with the situation at hand.\n\nAlso I think this game in not effectively playable with a keyboard. There are some challenges, you have to complete for a Driving License with a ridiculously volatile car named Dodge Viper, where accelerating a bit too much or steering to far will make it spin uncontrollably.","June 11, 2014","true","42.5"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","3"

This is why I say yes in a simplistic -List.\n\nPros\n-Variety of cars/bikes from Mustangs to Ferrari to Harley Davidson.\n-Decent Graphics for a driving game of its nature.\n-RPG Elements. Houses you can customize, a comprehendable profile system, Club Houses, clothes and more.\n-Two Very Big and good looking Islands with plenty of roads and things to discover.(On that note)\n-More things to do than just drive against ai. Integrated SP and MP for those who like MP. Public Challenges, Clubs, car wrecks  you can salvage. photo missions, Casino if you get the dlc, decent player interaction, are just a few of the things.\n-Easy to progress and somewhat ok support for wheels, controllers etc. (Friends XboX 1 Controller Works with this\nfor example)\n\nCons\n-No developer to update anymore\n-Registering on the game website and getting Atari Tokes for DLC can be a pain\n-Glitches and Speed Hackers\n-From what I hear unstable servers(Never Experinced Myself)\n-Confusing Police\n-Some graphical bugs for some(Pink Skid Marks for example)\n-And a few minor other things that bugs me but does not stop the flow of this game\n\n\nAll In All I highly enjoy this game and suggest everyone at leasts watches some videos of this game on youtube and go with the open mind that people can exagerate problems (Pro or Con) and give this game a chance. You more than likely  will not regret it. As for comparisons to The Crew. Even though this games developers are included they are 2 Different games and I will play both in the future.

All the time I had with my buddies meeting up in middle of Hawaii and driving around, doing stunts and just having fun. Me with my Audi R8, which I still absolutely love, others with Nissan GT-R, Bikes etc. It was one of the greatest times I have ever had in games. Ever. Speeding through the city with 355km/h while others trying to catch you or the other way. Drifting, random races with other players. This game is AMAZING. Too bad Atari is killing it. It's really a shame. I just lost my profile because I installed Windows 10(clean install) and as it turns out Atari doesn't save your info on their servers but I don't even mind it because this game is THIS fun.

I have owned this game a little over 3 weeks and have made/met 18 of the coolest friends in that short time plus an absolute bucket load of friends using the retail version.\nI'll cut to the bad news first. Firstly you have to make an account at http://www.testdriveunlimited2.com to be able to play this game and to buy DLC. Secondly, Eden games made this and unfortunately for what ever reson went belly-up. Atari luckily stepped in and took the game over but clearly they haven't got the server side stuff in control.\nThis means you get things like:\n- Losing friends out of your profile and then sometimes they re-appear.\n- You can buy DLC and then have them turn into mardi gras pink mustangs ( no joke they are vehicles won through a one on one duel with a campaign progress character).\n-Some of the MMO aspects of the game fail or get broken regularly, meaning that you won't be able to find and join your buds or invite them to things like games in the casino or to your houses or for just a free-ride drive.\n- If you want to get the casino and or drive a range of cars and bikes you have to buy Atari points at the TDU2 website which is a turn off for many people to say the least because it can be tedious although myself, I never had any issues with it.\nThe Casino DLC is $10AUD and cars work out to be $1AUD each @ $5AUD for 400 Atari points (Pay by Paypal for less hassle).\nThese things are the worst parts of the game and some come and go as mentioned.\nGreat things about the game:\n- You drive in an open world and work your way through getting licenses for different classes of vehicles and events on the islands of Ibiza and Hawaii.\n- Meet a lot of great people and make friends with people all over the world (personally I dont even have a problem with non english players) I just ask them, 'you use Steam? Add me as friend :)' even if they don't use the Steam version some make Steam accounts and add the game to non-Steam shortcuts. Then its easy, the add me and I have Google Translate open in the Steam in game browser so they can talk to me in their own language outside of in game chat, problem solved! :)\n- Did I mention Bikes? :D\n- Huge amount of Cars (some are DLC), unfortunately only 3 Bikes (DLC), huge array of clothing and customisations to your character by the use of plastic surgeon and to your cars by paintshops and tuning upgrades, a Casino and many properties that you can buy to house your vehicles. I totally dig the MMO aspect of this game even in it's breaks a lot state.\nThe game graphics may not look as good as say Grid2 but that never bothered me, I like the open world aspect and MMO of the game. I've bought almost all the DLC for the game too because I think the game is worth it especially when you snag it for $5 and there are ways to deal with stuff when the Atari/TDUlife servers break etc like the Steam adding to compensate as I mentioned. Also I should mention that my X-Box controller works very well for me in this game and the game does support a fair amount of G' series wheels but you might want to Google the game to find out for sure if it supports yours.\nI dedicate this review to all the great people I have met in the game, they 'make' the game in my opinion. Also I'm going to put up some of the screenshots I have and will hopefully get the time to make a Youtube tribute to the game if not also my friends. It may be some time for TDU3 to come out and fingers crossed it will be for PC too. I won't wait around like I did getting this game I wished I'd bought it last Christmas.\nOne other thing. Don't or avoid buying DLC vehicles (Google TDU2 DLC vehicles list so you know which they are) you didn't pay for with Atari points when the servers get attacked/modified and become unlocked to buy with just cash. You need to have unlocked them with Atari points in game and or purchased at the TDU2 website because at some stage they will revert to pink Mustangs only worth around $25k. $1.5 million exotic car turning into a $25k pink Mustang....not cool and you'll just be throwing in game cash away.\nAlso, back your game save up periodically not that I've had any save game corruptions as of yet but there are many who claim they lost all they're game progress. The game saves literally everytime you go to the menu and when you quick travel so maybe that was fixed. Better to be safe than sorry I guess but to be honest I only started religiously backing them up when my Ducati that I legimately got with Atari points turned into a Mustang. Its not happened again with any other vehicle since and I did just rebuy it after selling the Mustang.","December 26, 2013","true","242.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

The physics are weird; something close to simcade, but it's like the game doesn't know what it wants to be. The graphics are very lackluster with low-poly models, low-res textures, and crappy lighting. The voice acting is plain awful. The sound design is extremely weak. Test Drive Unlimited 2 screams "low budget" in every category you can judge it in. And despite all of that, it's extremely comfy. For anyone who's ever fantasized about living in the world of an arcade racer, it's all there. You buy dream houses so you can have enough space for all of your shiny supercars, then you take said supercars and hurtle them across two sun-soaked islands with complete freedom. It's just plain comfy. If that's the kind of racer you want, go ahead and pick this game up. It's jam-packed full of shortcomings and yet it's still able to hit a spot in your inner kid's heart that many other racers can't.","January 16","true","38.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Love playing this game with the setup and the force feedback makes it so much more realistic. I've also been lucky enough to have visited both islands in the game, and its close to the real thing, but of course they can't possibly recreate it to a T, but close enough to see some familiar roads and buildings.\n\nThere's a good number of cars available in game, even motorcycles but only available as DLC which I don't think is up anymore for purchase. There are races to compete in, events to accomplish, and even getting your license on each category of cars. There's also 6 bonus cars that's hidden on both islands which you have to find, each car needs 10 parts in order to own them.\n\nI don't understand some people that complain about the graphics and other stuff, especially when the game was made in  2011 or earlier. It was made years ago, so of course due to the advancement of technology today would make it look dated. Don't give it a bad review just because you expect the game to look like todays current games. This goes across the board on all games in fact, reading all these negative reviews just doesn't give the game any justice at all.\n\nI really enjoy this game, an oldie but a goodie indeed.

And trust me, the worse is pretty bad. But first, the better.\n\nThe game is spread across multiple hawaiian islands, in an open world campaign, which is pretty awesome. It also has a great selection of cars, missions, races and other things to participate in, such as painting your cars and altering your avatars appearance, clothing and hairstyle. So far, so good, the game really can be quite fun. I'd rate the physics as either one of the most realistic arcade games I've played, or one of the least realistic simcades I've played. But on to the negatives.\n\nThe game rarely works without modification, I had to use a standalone launcher (which takes away my ability to gain Steam achievements) to make the game work consistantly. Even still, I can only play a couple hours before the game crashes. But really... I'm ok with that. I'll tell you now what really, truly infuriates me.\n\nThere are certain timed missions in the game, that are absolutely, positively impossible to complete without driving like a balls to the wall, completely suicidal  lunatic. Take Mad Max style driving, and turn it up my 5. Then, add to that the fact that the most unpredictable traffic in the world is included, and the customer who's car you're delivering doesn't want it scratched, or driven off road, and welcome to the most utterly infuriating racing game ever known to man. I literally can't tell you the number of times that all I've needed to complete a mission is one more damn second, and everything would have been fine. But the game creators set time limits that apparently only God would be able to achieve, because not only must you be a driving god, you must also be the luckiest son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ in the world for traffic not to cut you of and screw up your entire damn race.\n\nNow, I know the above paragraph is utterly critical, and even hateful of the game, but I still recommend it... especially on sale. I bought the game for $5, and I've gotten my moneys worth out of it already. I just really wish these particular missions were not made so freaking impossible. The other 95% of the game is fantastic, but that 5% of the games missions completely, and utterly infuriates me. Other than that (and the instability, and utter lack of reliable online support, and need to launch the game through a third party launcher) the game is pretty fun. Just be sure to pick up the universal launcher so you can play offline.\n\nhttp://i-knyazev.ru/tools/tdu2-universal-launcher/","June 7, 2015","true","4.2"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","6"

Also, Atari merged TDU 1 with this so you can go to Hawai in this game aswell. Of course repolished with "new" 2011 graphics. Sidenote: If you are willing to use motorbikes like you did on TDU 1, you have to pay extra 5 dollars to Atari via their website. You unlock motorbikes with Atari tokens in game. 80 tokens per "premium" DLC'ish vehicles and you can buy 400 tokens for 5dollars.

Then i realized they left out the Lambos from the 2nd... I played a lot the first part and of course the driving physics are nothing to write home about, but there was a certain feeling to the free roaming going 300km/h in a cabrio Lamborghini or such cars in a huge island, and simply (and very sadly) there is no other game like this, that you can buy houses and nice cars in nice locations. So i didn't hesitate much when i purchased the second for like 20 euros or so. After investing 30 hours in it i realized the developers concentrated and tryed to improve on the wrong aspects of the first game to make this sequel. Which resulted in a worse game than the first.\n\nThe cop chases are downright broken. I like challenge, but the police cars coming straight at you with 200+km/h in a one direction road, and every few seconds. I think this is a major fault in this sequel. I remember the first TDU and there was nothing like this, the cop chases were fun and challanging in the same time. In a driving game this is important for me.\n\nAlso collecting points for making facial surgeries? Are you kidding me? I can get past this, as you can just ignore this feature, but this kind of mentality is visible throughout the game. Even if you dont want to, the game reminds you that you should be wanting to become the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of all time. The scenarios and missions could have been made very fluid and easy to believe, but they are just dragging you out of the environment and putting you into a minigame inside of a game.\n\nCan't skip the cut scenes before the races, they are incredibly annoying after hearing them for the first few times.\n\nSome cars have their gear rations mixed up. I realized in a few cars,i think they were Lotuses, that their 3rd gear is higher than their 4th. Basically these two gear ratios are swapped.\n\nI understand they couldn't implement proper collision physics into the game with real life cars. But this is as far from test driving as possible nowadays. But at least the first TDU could somehow make me forget this. I was eager to get all the nice cars, and get some villas in nice locations. But the more i discovered and tryed out in the second part the more i got disillusioned. I just deleted it and i can not reccomend it to anyone, especially at this price. Maybe at a massive discount, but even then, you should stick with the first part in my opinion.","July 22, 2014","false","28.9"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

This game is so buggy, cheesy, and uninspired, it should have never come out. I have fond memories of TDU 1 on the Xbox 360, that game was so fun, looked great (at the time) and was overall a very good game. This game seems dead out of the gate. Graphics are very subpar, they don't even look as good as I remember TDU1 looking, driving system is OK, the "story" is absolutely GOD AWFUL. The "acting" of the in-game characters is actually worse "acting" than you'd see in a   p o r n o film!!! Let that sink in.. I would provide a more full review of this game but unfortunately the game glitched on me and I cannot pass one of the first objectives.. (go to the car club) it won't let me enter the mission so I just gave up.. waste of $5, don't spend any more than that.

The launcher may say "Server Offline" but that does not mean anything, start the game and you will get connected to the server, if you don't, then check your network settings! It may be the server is offline once in a while - happens to every game! And you actually can play the game in single player with an online profile!\n\nHANDLING\nI play the TDU series since 2007 and in my opinion the cars in the first game had a better handling once you have unlocked "H-Mode" which changed the gravity and cars felt more real! Not real, but better than cars in TDU2! There is no "H-Mode" in TDU2 anymore, the advantage is that players don't hate each other for driving a different mode, the disadvatage is the fun! Nah, it is not THAT bad, the cars handling is somewhere between an arcade game and realistic driving.\n\nWORLD\nIn the first TDU game we had Hawaii/Oahu Island already, which is more or less a copy of the real Oahu Island! It is big, nice detailed, and the graphics are really not bad, it will take you a while to see everything! In TDU2 we have an updated version of the same Oahu Island map, plus Ibiza! Ibiza is even more detailed and really nice for slow exploring, while Hawaii is nicer for lot of fast racing and cruising with friends!\n\nCAREER & ONLINE\nThe career is implented to the online game (where you can play single player if you change your setting to not "allow online interactions!", start your game online and after that you can play it single player whenever you want) If the server is really not available, you still can play your online account offline!\n\nYou'll have a lot to do to progress in level, win races and championship against the computer, race online against others, both has different race modes (race, time race, knockout race, offroad, street, bike)! Also you progress the game by all kind of other things, make friends, buy cars, buy houses, buy clothes, or a new hairstyle for your character, everything gets you up in level! Yes, i know.. it is a racing game and some people don't like such things in a racing game, people always find a reason to cry!\n\n- online & offline play (cruise with up to 8 player in one session)\nwhile you cruise around the island the game puts you in 'sessions' with people close to you, you can lock yourself to another player so while the game changes the session, you will stay in one session with the player you locked to!\n\n- two huge and detailed islands (Hawaii is even 4 times bigger than Ibiza)\nWhat can i say, it will take you ages until you have seen all roads, and offroads!\n\n- cars and (dlc) bikes\nBikes are only available as DLC, and only 3 of them, some more cars you can get as DLC too! Some cars you unlock by finding wrecks of them around the two islands! Also, the Casino is a DLC, you can win money or cars at slot machines or play Poker Texas Hold'Em with other players!\n\n- race, create races, challanges..\nA lot to do! Of course it is more fun to race against other players, but be carefull, don't bet too much money! The single player races are really (too) easy, a good way to make money for cars and houses and progress in level!\n\n-make friends, invite them to you home, race them, create a club, club racing, even have your friends with you in your car as Co-driver! Or just cruise with them, or alone.. there are different type of players, you will find the hardcore driver who only cruise with class A cars and burn their tires on oahu all time, some player prefer driving a real style.. even using indicator! And of course we have the noobies who crash you as a way of saying hi - i love you too but stop scratching my damn car!\n\n- Day/Night cycle, weather\nDamn, driving offroad in a thunderstorm looks really good!\n\n\nIf you like cars, open world, online gaming, huge game worlds, and spending lot of time in a game, TDU2 is really for you! The game is not perfect, but still awesome! No real handling like other leading racing games, but more freedom than every other racing game! And no, the handling is not that bad.. i think its still better than most other racing games, as i said somewhere between arcade and real!\n\nThe only game i have played more than TDU2 was the first TDU (and back a decade, operation flashpoint!)\n\nI am sure i forgot to mention something, but let me tell you if you are thinking about buying the game and having daubts, leave the daubts aside and give it a go, if you are interested in this game then it wont disapoint you!\n\n","December 11, 2013","true","880.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

And skips the extremely annoying cutscenes, and all these really bad story characters that are just badly voiced over stereotypes.\n( At least for my French version, the dubs are borderline ridiculous )\nEven if you're only interested in cruising, this games fails to be better than TDU1, it even fails being any good at all.\nIt managed to take the exact same recipe and they made it tedious and boring. I'm not sure how. But in TDU1, you will build a much bigger garage in a shorter time. But without it being too easy. TDU1 has a good balance.\n\nReally, the ONLY reason to buy TDU2 over downloading TDU1 ( clearly, Atari is utterly dead, don't waste your money buying it in a shop you won't help Atari getting back its feet. Also, pretty sure nobody sells TDU1 and its dlcs today )\nIs to drive in Ibiza.\nIbiza is quite nice actually, not as big as Hawaii. But you can still ride in Hawaii in TDU2.

I absolutley loved TDU1 ,so i decided to buy this one. At the start i was amazed.The Graphics , The Gameplay , The 2 Maps. Everything was great except my PC. Which could run the game with only 45 fps...\nThe game started its lifetime very well. It had alot of cars, Great multiplayer/online , casino , appartments , garrages and all the stuff that one good open world racing game needs. 1 Year after release they announced  The Bike DLC . I was so excited about it. It came out and it was good. The problem was , that u had to buy every bike individually. On that time the multiplayer was working , singleplayer was great and everything was done well for this game so far. But then the problems came.\n\nGameplay/AI\nThe Gameplay/AI had few problems:  Driving Licenses , Cops and Controlls.\nDriving License: The problem is that some of the challenges , are too hard to complete or even impossible for some players. Without Driver License u cant progress through the higher rank races.\nCops: Just like the Driver License , here with the cops ... its too hard to outrun them. I like challenges , but for some players this is hell. They are always stoped by the cops , no matter what they do.\nControlls: For the players with wheels this is not a problem. But for players who use keyboard its really hard to drive. In TDU1 was better optimized to drive with keyboard.\n\nCommunity\nJust like the most of the games , they have good community base behind them. There was great  Mods  released by the community moders. It added more cars , skins and everything that one mod can add to the game. But then some "Bad Modders" decided to ruin the fun for the most of the players. From this moment ...  The problems started\n\nLate Multiplayer Problems and Site Problems/Closed Studio\nHowever , after the good start with the DLC's and Multiplayer , the problems kicked in.  "The Bad Modders"  developed hacks. That ruined the multiplayer pretty much. For example u are driving Bugatti Veyron with 400 km/h and some guy with subaru drives by u with 500 km/h. It impossible.\n\nEven after that , players were still playing the game.  However in 2014 the site was broken. New players couldn't register their accounts , so they couldn't even play the multiplayer. The multiplayer servers were down every week. It was unplayable. In later 2015 , Atari announced they are quiting TDU Studio. That was the end of TDU.\n\nOverall\nI dont recommend this game , even on sale. Its just not worth it. So many problems and bad gameplay. The only good  thing left from this game is the singleplayer mods. Developers did nothing , to even try to fix their game from the hackers.\n\n3/10 Not recommended\n\nNOTE: The servers may be still working , but its not worth it. U will get only bad server connection and u wont get any new content. Buy at your own risk.","May 6","false","48.1"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","12","20","2","4"

You find yourself driving responsibly a lot of the time because its nice to do. You follow traffic, cruise around look at the nice scenary. Its bliss\n\nCons:\n- Day Night is static and only changes to what ever that place is set to on the map. One place will always be night time   for example.\n- No CLK DTM AMG? Why??? Where is the classics from the first game? Hardly any decent choice of japanese sports cars either its too european. The audi choice is not bad like there is a few but i want a nissan skyline or a silvia or rx7 those cars are more important than some silly hair dressors car like the 4x4 wannabe offroader that sucks at offroad\n-Offroading only works with certain cars. I mean sure i expect some cars not to do as good but come on limiting the speed the way its done even though i should be going faster is annoying.\n- Controls are a bit of a step backwards in some areas (controller using avatar mode and trying to turn does not work i have to use the pad and a mouse wtf)\n- Radio Music mostly sucks. like 90% of the music on it and it gets too repetitive.\n- Randomly crashing as soon as i load in to the server\n- The atari account can be a bit of a ballache\n- No test drive unlimited 3 so far.\n- When I have somebody ring me up on a phone and i press cancel i dont want them to call back again a moment later its annoying.\n- Some lack of car choices here and there. You just think pft really you could of had more of something else..\nQuick thoughts.. Bought it on sale for a bit less than £4 It is a whole lot of game for that £4 I spent on it and worth every penny.. Sure it has a lot of flaws but its a nice game to get lost in and just immerse yourself into. I played The Crew and while a couple things about it might seem a bit better the game as a whole ain't got [s-h^i_t=] on test drive unlimited. Worth a buy. Its a game you will play for hours and feel like you only played five minutes of. I love how long it takes to get from one side of the map to the other also Kudos to atari for including a revamped updated version of the old map and NOT charging it as dlc. Devs hear this. We got the old map from the last game that has been updated and stuff, and a separate map on this game. We could of had tthe one map and it would of still been pretty much the same old but we got both without paying out our bummholes. Oh and there is a point to driving around that map too. The annoying thing about this game is the dlc cars using atari coins thing on the webpage.. Wtf even is that? Just put them in a pack put it on steam don't overcharge and make people happy I'm not going to the effort of atari coins ubisoft does a similar thing and they're as bad as ea.\n\nJust buy it, be happy. The maps feel big, maybe not as big as the crew but the crew has like nothing to it and these maps are better.","February 8","true","21.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The graphics are a bit dated now and the driving is more arcade than anything meaning the cars handle and perform nothing like the real things or even similar representations in other games. The road design is often better suited to a Need for Speed franchise where wrecking is purposely added and part of the whole atmosphere of the game.\n\nSome of the stuff you do in the game, things required to advance and otherwise, seem pointless and like "so what?" at best. Like clothes shopping and cosmetic surgery for a couple. Who really cares about either and most of the clothes are a joke and ridiculous beyond  belief. Many of the achievements needed to advance are very tedious and often require co-operation of other players. Good luck there both in finding enough players to help you and then finding enough good sports who'll actually help you. There's a casino DLC with its own blend of poker, slots, roulette and some players seem to prefer the casino to driving. Advancing through the different level cars requires a tiered licensing before you can buy the faster cars.\n\nThe story is thin- you basically work your way through a racing series called Solar Crown using various class cars from old classics to high dollar exotics to off-road. You win cash and sometimes cars from AI drivers you compete against. Warning here- this is another game where the AI cars can bump you off the road, spin you out and all that while they are about totally resistant to anything you do to them. A wreck may cost you 10 or more seconds to recover from but the AI cars hardly slow down when they wreck.\n\nThere are 'missions' you do along the way to earn money and some of them are kind of dumb, too. but they pay. There is an 'assist the cops' and 'run from the cops' ability that nets you special decals and a cop car at some point. A treasure hunt is included where you find pieces of cars that once assembled become yours. These include a Cobra Daytona Coupe, Cobra SC 427, a 70 Charger, VW Beetle, an Audi, and a few others. There are a number of DLC cars and motorcycles as well. There is a paint shop of sorts but you can't do any physical customizing like tires/wheels, window tint, wings, ground effects, etc. Only paint/stickers.\n\nYou can start a club and compete with other clubs and if you have enough money and reputation the club gets special cars to share with club members. But good luck there because there is no way to communicate with other club members unless you all happen to be on-line at the same time so event planning tends to fail and the clubs don't seem to last. My own few club interaction experiences were closer to demolition derbys and gang warfare than car races.\n\nThere are what are called Community Racing Centers with player created challenges in the game. Both are things you are supposed to do- make challenges and compete in them. Early on in the game they were so full of cheating it was a sad joke. They're supposed to be better now and the easy cheats fixed but I can't get psyched about trying them again and not messing with them has zero effect on the game being fun.  There are the player vs player and leade board challenges, too, both at spots throughout the map and immediately initiated by a flash of headlights. Again, in the early days of the game, one of the cheats had the ability to stop the clock during a race so all the leader boards show course times of 0.00.00 going hundreds and hundreds deep. It's not just impossible to beat such times, but the boards have never been cleaned off that I know of. so nobody stands a fair chance. Players used multiple IDs, set a time and never bring that record setting player back online to accept any challenges. If that's important stuff to you, I don't know what to say.\n\nAt the end of the game, it's just done in an anti-climactic sort of way. There are no more missions, no more 'new' races and there's nothing new to do. It's all "make your own fun" after that. There are still ways to make money- you can re-race every event you ran as often as you like. You can make money for driving semi-recklessly - right on the centerline - or some fields make money bouncing around in an off-road car. It's slow going but you can earn money to keep buying and modifying cars up to the limits of the garage spaces you have. Oh yeah, you have to buy houses with garage slots to store your cars... You get the idea.\n\nStiill, even with not a lot left to do, it is full open world and you do have some cool cars to cruise around in which is a ball in itself and why I keep playing it again and again.  All the fun of a driving game without the pressure to do anything but drive around!","March 5, 2014","true","795.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Seamless blending of multiplayer and single player is a bold claim made while in actual fact if the multiplayer servers are down you cannot play single player or anything.  The driving tests become impossible when you hit Hawaii mostly due to the vehicles supplied for the A class licence has the most terrible handling and will spin out of controll.  The vehicle upgrades improve performace of the said vehicle but offer not much in encouragement to upgrade.  You simply select from a list of leveled upgrades.  Often times you will find yourself googling for some answers as to how to do something as not everything is intuitive.  Driving around Ibiza or Hawaii you will often find what you think are challenges you can enter, which are infact multiplayer challenges that upon entering you soon find 0 online sessions, or ones you cannot join so in essence nobody seems to be hosting multiplayer challenges other than the instant challenges you can get from other players as you encounter them in the game.  The way to make money is to do the single player chalenges which there are plenty of but that hardly seems like a reason to have the multiplayer aspect in the first place.

Otherwise, you're in for a very bad time)\n\nIntroductionTDU2 is a very unique game. It's a driving game with heavy emphasis on social elements, such as real estate, clubs, clothing, and even (wait for it) hairstyles. That being said, I wouldn't see why anyone would want to play this offline, as most of the fun is found online. It was very buggy and otherwise a forgettable game at launch, but after numerous patches, both official and unofficial, I can certainly say that this game has had most of the kinks ironed out, and it's now a playable and fun game. TDU2 features more than 80 vehicles, miles and miles of drivable area, and several game modes for you to enjoy.\n\nContent- 8/10This game features a little over 80 cars (more if you count mods, DLC, and prize cars), ranging from humble little cars like the Volkswagen Golf, to explosive hypercars such as the Bugatti Veyron. However, I will say something about the selection of cars in this game, and that is that I am very disappointed in the bias of cars. There are literally FIVE Pagani Zondas for you to choose from, 10 Ferraris, 4 Bugatti Veyrons, but not a single Honda, Mazda, or Toyota? Now that's just biased as hell. I would honestly rather be able to drive a preppy car like a Mazda RX7, Honda Civic, or Toyota Supra than I would some insane hypercar like the Ferrari 599XX, which almost guarantees that I'm going to crash it while going 250MPH, thanks to this game's ridiculous driving physics. The game does allow for you to explore more than 100 miles of in game area, spanning two islands, Hawaii and Ibiza, as well as several in game shops and points of interest. Still, I feel like the game would be a bit more enjoyable if the physics didn't make me so prone to crashing. Speaking of the physics, let's talk about them real quick.\n\nGameplay- 6/10Initially, I found the physics to be extremely jarring. The start of the game requires you to drive Tess, the game's main antagonist, to her photoshoot in her daddy's Ferrari. Every teenage boy's wet dream, right? Well, yeah, if I could actually drive the car without smashing it into every single corner. The cars in this game are able to accelerate very quickly, but holy hell, the braking and handling is just AWFUL. It literally felt like I was playing a 2011 version of Outrun, except I was in a much faster Ferrari, and the b!tch was yelling at me to slow the F down every 5 seconds. After finally making it to the photoshoot, my "avatar" (who is literally the most metrosexual person I've ever seen, holy hell) descended from the vehicle, along with the damsel in distress, and were quickly escorted into the building. After that, I was given a quick walkaround of my now smashed to hell and back Ferrari, and then the screen faded into the "cutscene".\nYou can get into police chases and races and all that good stuff, so I guess the actual gameplay is very redeeming.\n\nLet me give a quick piece of advice about the player models/storyline in this game: ignore it. Pretend it doesn't exist. Pretend you're playing Forza Horizon on the PC, I don't really care. Just do whatever it takes to get past this game's godawful acting.\n\nAudio - 3/10Oh my god. Ohhhhh my god. The voice acting in this game. Oh my f*ck. Eden Games would've done a better job having Microsoft Sam voice all the characters in this game, because at least that woulda been rather funny. But this? Jesus H. Christ. Why must all the characters in this game talk like *gasp* THIS? (Pretend that I'm flicking my wrist in the most gay way possible as I'm saying that). Like seriously, you think Dragon Age Inquisition catered too much to the gay crowd? Not even close, sweetheart, this game is a whole new level of metrosexual. I'm talking this game will pimpslap you if it sees you trying to play without wearing Michael Kors pants and a Gucci suit.\n\nAs if the voice acting weren't bad enough, the ingame music is just plain garbage, as if the guy who was hired to pick the music had to meet some sort of racial quota, so he went on World Star Hiphop and picked out the most Liberal sounding music he could find. Other than mediocre hip hop, you can choose from dad rock, or the occasional electro/house song. And that REALLY pisses me off, because the song used in the game's trailer is one of my favorite songs of all time, Ghosts 'n' Stuff by Deadmau5. And that's literally the only song in the game that won't make your ears bleed. Disappointing, isn't it? Thankfully, you can mod in your own music with a bit of effort, but the fact that that feature was included in TDU1 but NOT in TDU2, that makes me extremely mad. Honestly, I would recommend TDU over TDU2, if it weren't for the fact that Atari killed the TDU multiplayer.\n\nGraphics - 9/10The graphics are probably the most redeeming part of the game. For a 2011 game, I have to admit that these graphics are top notch, and I'm pretty sure even FM3 or GT5 didn't look THIS good. However, you will need a very good computer to run it at max graphics, and I'd honestly recommend a 144hz monitor to go along with it, since you don't want to have all that motion blur when driving your car around Ibiza at 250 MPH. One of the super unique features of this game is that you can actually get into a car dealer and look around your car, get inside, start the engine, open the doors, and even roll down the windows. How many games allow you to roll down the windows? Almost none. The surrounding environment is very lush and vivid, certainly FAR better than the grayish brown filter that seems to be employed in almost all modern racing games. However, about the graphics, the game doesn't go into very much detail with car damage. You can scrape up your car, get it muddy, and crack a window or two, but that's about it. I understand that the licensers (i.e. Ferrari, Bugatti, Koenigsegg) don't want to see their precious 2 million dollar hypercars getting thrashed about, but it still breaks the immersion a bit. Speaking of immersiveness, you can visually upgrade your car to a certain extent by adding vinyls, paint, and rims, but that's about it. I understand that the licensers don't want their cars being adorned with pink neon and 30" spinners, but again, it kinda breaks the immersion.\n\nMultiplayer - 9/10I gotta admit, the multiplayer is one of the coolest parts about this game. One of the best features from my favorite game, NFS Underground 2, is that you can challenge another racer at any time simply by pulling up behind them and flashing your hi beams. This is also implemented in TDU2, and you can even set your own wager, giving a new meaning to "big dog on the block". Other than that, you can spiff up your "avatar" (I really, really hate that word. Why can't we say "player" or "racer"?) by buying him new hats, glasses, suits, pants, gloves, and hairstyles, to really wow your friends/opponents. You can also buy your own pad to REALLY wow them, ranging from the basic trailer park, to the all inclusive 300' yacht. All in all, I must say that the MP is really a great example of how a racing MMO is PROPERLY done, and I'd definitely recommend this game over NFS World or HEAT Online.\n\nClosing Notes & Final ScoreAll in all, TDU2 is a very unique concept for the racing genre, and defnitely a step in the right direction for MMOs as a whole. The in game music and player models are absolute @$$, but if you can look past them, then I'm certain you'll have plenty of fun with TDU2\n\nFINAL SCORE - 7/10 Great","March 7, 2015","true","27.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","7","11","2","3"

I enjoyed playing some of the old TDU titles and was hoping to have some good times playing them again. I had issues with my Atari account (I'm still unable to connect as the password recovery system is flawed) and the game won't start no matter what I try. Will probably request a refund as it is broken as hell. If you're looking for a good racing sim, check the Store and you're gonna find a bunch that worth way more than TDU2.","December 20, 2014","false","1.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

I got it in 2011 on the PS3 and it was fantastic. The feel of picking my character, driving my car and getting miffed off when I failed the licenses. This game will take some work to finish it, but you can download a save. If you are looking for a game, to drive around, just cruise innocently, this is for you. If you are worrying about graphics, I can run it on my AMD 7850K alone, with an avg. 62/63 fps on very low and an avg. 25/26 on very high.\n\nHowever, since the bloody servers went down for good, the game just doens't have that same feel. It feels, dead, almost. Yes, you can cruise around, but you cannot meet anyone else and make a club, drive around with your friends, etc. The game doesn't have that same ring to it. I'm surprised the game is even still for sale, and at £14.99, I'd avoid it at that price. I got this in the sale for £3.74 I think. The game isn't even worth over £10 anymore. The developers have laid off the game entirely and abandoned it. To be honest, TDU3 would be nice seeing *wink*. The online servers aren't even up I don't think. I think the developers lost a battle in court or something, but I'm not sure.\n\nOverall thoughts:\n\nThis is genuinley a fantastic game. The driving is a bit 'meh', but still driveable. The euphoria I sometimes experienced when driving on the coast in my Audi R8, was unreal. I have so much nostalgia for this. Back to my thoughts on this, TDU2 isn't worth paying £14.99 for. Get it in the sale, when it is considerably cheaper. Overall, I would recommend this game.","January 5","true","14.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I do still recommend the game, and if anyone is having a problem running the game there are go arounds on the forums, you just need to search for them.","January 13","true","13.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sevandres/recommended/9930/","Sevandres","Sevandres","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sevandres/","164 products in account","Test Drive Unlimited 2\nI played just under ten hours of it on the night of February 28th into March 1st on the year 2015, straight through. The first hour and a half wasn't with out any difficulty as I had to fix a small issue with the launcher. It still doesn't work right, but I can open the game which is good enough for me. That ate up my first 15 minutes. Unfortunately I did not take that as a sign of things to come.\n\nThe next hour and fifteen minutes was spent trying to get the G27 to cooperate with my preferred settings. It wasn't until the end of that hour and fifteen that I realized that it was my fault that it wouldn't cooperate. Just one small issue, I wasn't clicking the right button to save my settings.\n\nOnce I got the controls sorted, the next 8 and a half hours was spent mostly cruising in my classic Mustang. The world is huge and open for you to explore, and there are two maps to explore. The driving could have been better polished, but it is still quite enjoyable. Additionally I find it nice to have the option to have Automatic, Sequential (Paddle shifting), H-Shifter or H-Shifter + Clutch options for driving. I drive the Mustang in Automatic mode as it has a 3 speed Auto. I prefer to keep things traditional in the game. If I drove a manual car, then I would be grabbing my own gears with the stick.\n\nFinally towards the last two hours of it, I got a buddy of mine in this game and he and I cruised around. The multiplayer has to be the biggest flaw as it only works when it wants to. Other players can also be annoying as they constantly follow you and challenge you to unwanted races, but with the average population of 10 at the most, you can imagine why. If for some reason you're disconnected from the online play, how ever, you can still play and save your progress just fine. You would just be alone as all.\n\nThe game is nearly perfect if you want to go cruising around. It challenges your driving in multiple different ways with different style of driving with different types of cars. If you can get the multiplayer to work, you can go cruising with your friends. Or you can stick to single player and rack up Championships and Licenses to make more in-game money that can be used to cloth your avatar or trick out your ride, or even buy a house!\n\nOne last thing to mention is that the strongest of cars, the best lookers, you have to pay real-money for. Suggesting it has a pay to win model, but anyone can spend money on a nice car and not know how to drive it. In this scenario, it's all about perspectives.","March 1, 2015","true","28.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For those who need to kick back, TDU2 offers many social features, and even a casino. With all of your hard-earned cash, you’ll be able to purchase new houses, vehicles, furniture, clothing and for some reason, even a haircut and plastic surgery.\n\nThe game's traditional race championships and missions alone can take 60+ hours to complete, but if you're a completionist like me, don't expect to put this down until you've amassed well over 100 hours.

PROTIP... use the chrome browser for it. you can actually accept the terms of service. then you have to validate the email and link your account to your in game profile. SERVERS HAVE TO BE UP. now there are rumors that they may permanently shut the servers down... this would make the game unplayable because you couldnt register or link. now the next step is you have to start the launcher for the game and some people have to release ports on there router. and some people have to enable direct sound... me i still dont have sound in the game. still working on that... just save your money. omg run while you still can. i doubt this game will work in a week of this posting. just buy a real game.","December 22, 2014","false","0.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Definitely agree... How to introduce this game ? Easily. Imagine long highway with few cars, long and straight like a Route 66, then car of your choose... Pagani maybe, and that speed. Probably best description on this game.\n\nMore than 100 cars to drive, from Ferrari to Mercedes and Audi. From Jaguar to Alfa, and really, really more. And where they drop you ? Hawaii + Ibiza. Tropic islands full of long roads, beautiful places, and awesome views. Story is there just because somebody wants it there... It has no relevant point, only making of money, for buying cars and houses. You can style your character from eybrows to hairstyle, and of course your clothes. Houses are also ugly and luxury. You can own even a boat in which underwater garage you're able to put those beautiful machines...\n\nThe worst thing of all is, that multiplayer is dead. It's sad, but it's truth. At least we can be very HAPPY that Atari runs those servers at least for those few players that are in. I wonder when they turn off servers which won't be so far, and then multiplayer will be really dead. By this I want to say TD3.\n\nIn fact, I love this game. I love it more than any game of NFS series. I love it more than any Dirt or CMR... Any relevant rival would be The Crew from Ubi.

I want to, on some level. but I can't.\n\nIf you are like me and just would like to play offline, what you get is a driving game with very poor physics, very lite content, and a huge amount of pay walls. I really dislike seeing DLC I don't have access to. All the good cars are basically DLC.\n\nNow suppose you started playing "offline" and you suddenly have the urge to play "online". Well in this instance you have to start a new game. There is a way to use your previous save but, really, doing even that much work is just stupid.\n\nThen there is the "characters". Two Islands filled with the douchy-est characters I've ever seen in a game. Its just awful, even for the time it was released.\n\nKeyboard is near impossible to use, which would have been fine for a game leaning more to the "sim" side of things, but for an arcade racer, it seems lazy. Keyboard doesn't need to be the focus, but at least they could have thought about it.\n\nThe physics themselves are okay right up to the point you lose traction. Even with a wheel, breaking loose is pretty much unrecoverable. Cars will also randomly barrel-role in a jump. That actually seems to be on purpose so you can get points.\n\nJust avoid the game. Its just not that great but also the way DLC was handled is just terrible. I'm fine with paid DLC but I prefer having a whole complete product first then adding value on top of that, instead of slicing bit off for more money.","June 21, 2014","false","55.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

After spending some time trying to get the game working (the servers are down apparently, and doesn't look like a temporary problem), I was hugely disappointed when it did actually manage to start. Game play (what little of it I actually managed to achieve was simply dire). Poor controls, car control is akin to driving games from the 8 bit era. Totally disgusted that I spent £3 on this. I'd have felt better if I'd have been scammed out of £100s by criminals.

Example being in interaction with other vehicles on the roads, hit them and you come to a dead stop... take a corner too rough and at least the game forgives a bit and will spin you as expected.\n\nOther glaring faults I consider are that the voice acting leaves a LOT to be desired, the motivation of the characters are extremly questionable, the amount of customization is lacking in variety, & finally the "unlocking" scheme is laughable.\n\nVOICE ACTIING\nvoice acting in just cause 2 was ten times better than this... just mentioning it.\n\nCharacter/Story Development\non a chance encounter mission this lady is at the side of the road in one of the major cities, and decides to ask some yabbo in a VW scirocco to take her Pagani Zonda to the mechanic shop because she doesnt have the time to... oh and dont scratch it...\n\nCustomization\nto be honest i have not even bothered, primarily because the "stickers" are a load of... and the tech shop is really all that is needed... I have not played the game long enough to comment on the impact that owning a mc-mansion has on gameplay nor needing to buy that poolside valet bar stool thingy that apaprently i can impress other TDU2 gamers with... to me this is the equivalent of getting Recon armor in halo, or Bedazzled guns in COD franchise, or worse still a bee in a bottle from Zelda franchise....\n\n\nUnlocking items\nAgain... having not played far enough to really get a sense of what is available I looked forward into FAQS and guides and saw that a player needs to to unlock the privilege to buy cars in game... nuff said... Whatever!!!\n\n\nin conclusion... the only selling point that this game brought to the table that i willingly thought would make it all worth it.. the open world aspect of being able to drive absolutely EVERYWHERE!! thats the only good thing about this worth mentioning...\n\nif you are looking for realism... look elsewhere\nif you are seeking an arcade-ish experience... look elsewhere\nif you want a decent story or plausible real life mimicry... look elsewhere\n\nif you are looking for an open world game that ~~promises a lot of potential~~ to drive various cars around a massive island while in the same time extremely slowly rising through the ranks of a Dubai-esque racing series with possible androids masquerading as humans... then this may be the game for you!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n","February 13, 2014","false","35.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Other than looking at the speedo you can't really gauge or feel how fast you're going. You can't really drift on this game very well, which is stupid since it's something which you can use to earn money within the game.

Except they forgot the funny.\nGrindy story with no variety\nServers are iffy at best. Hard to play with friends sometimes.\nWhile the races are painfully easy (no challenge at all if you are even remotely decent), the liscense challenges (which are COMPLETELY UNNECCESSARY. I have NEVER used ANYTHING from the schools in the actual races) are painfully difficult and are really the only thing that will slow progress.\nIt's pretty much dead in the competitive scene.

I started playing this series on the Playstation 2 and really loved how open and challeging it was. It's not like the other generic racing games where you just race a couple of times and instantly get a $1,000,000+ supercar. You have to work for hours upon hours in order to advance even a small percentage.\n\nEven though I found it gets a bit harder in my opinion to earn money in Test drive unlimited 2 then the first one, I have found no annoying bugs, glitches or other major problems while playing it. The main things I think could be improved would be server downtime and NPC's (They act a bit awkward at times). The server downtime can get annoying on people who just started playing so that is why I recommend playing in offline mode first before you go out and "show-off" your cars and items. If you don't know how to start in offline mode just ask me and I'll help.\n\nOverall the game is very good, but I wish they didn't remove or change some elements that were in the original. I sort of feel for Atari though, as they are in financial trouble and really can't help with server issues, rushing development of the game, etc.\n\nThe game obviously can be improved greatly but as of right now it is very good and I love it!\n\n9.7/10\n\n\n","May 5, 2013","true","299.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Example being in interaction with other vehicles on the roads, hit them and you come to a dead stop... take a corner too rough and at least the game forgives a bit and will spin you as expected.\n\nOther glaring faults I consider are that the voice acting leaves a LOT to be desired, the motivation of the characters are extremly questionable, the amount of customization is lacking in variety, & finally the "unlocking" scheme is laughable.\n\nVOICE ACTIING\nvoice acting in just cause 2 was ten times better than this... just mentioning it.\n\nCharacter/Story Development\non a chance encounter mission this lady is at the side of the road in one of the major cities, and decides to ask some yabbo in a VW scirocco to take her Pagani Zonda to the mechanic shop because she doesnt have the time to... oh and dont scratch it...\n\nCustomization\nto be honest i have not even bothered, primarily because the "stickers" are a load of... and the tech shop is really all that is needed... I have not played the game long enough to comment on the impact that owning a mc-mansion has on gameplay nor needing to buy that poolside valet bar stool thingy that apaprently i can impress other TDU2 gamers with... to me this is the equivalent of getting Recon armor in halo, or Bedazzled guns in COD franchise, or worse still a bee in a bottle from Zelda franchise....\n\n\nUnlocking items\nAgain... having not played far enough to really get a sense of what is available I looked forward into FAQS and guides and saw that a player needs to to unlock the privilege to buy cars in game... nuff said... Whatever!!!\n\n\nin conclusion... the only selling point that this game brought to the table that i willingly thought would make it all worth it.. the open world aspect of being able to drive absolutely EVERYWHERE!! thats the only good thing about this worth mentioning...\n\nif you are looking for realism... look elsewhere\nif you are seeking an arcade-ish experience... look elsewhere\nif you want a decent story or plausible real life mimicry... look elsewhere\n\nif you are looking for an open world game that ~~promises a lot of potential~~ to drive various cars around a massive island while in the same time extremely slowly rising through the ranks of a Dubai-esque racing series with possible androids masquerading as humans... then this may be the game for you!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n","February 13, 2014","false","35.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"Decent" game.  This coming from someone who's never played the first game, I have mixed feelings, and thoughts about the differences between the two products.  Anyway, I will give you my honest impressions on this game after having it for a year or so.\n\nThis game greets you with absolutely beautiful graphical detail, and very accurate vehicale models.  This game simulates modern, and classic vehicles in a very accurate manner, along with accurate prices too. (Most of the time.)\n\nThere are many ways to earn money in this game, some more convenient than others, some more fun than others.  One is by completing the Solar Crown Championships, which require certain vehicle types to participate in.  Now, let me say this... I DO NOT recommend attending the championships, unless you enjoy completing some of the most repetitive, monotenous acts I've ever seen.  I mean, most of them are common in a lot of racing games today, however, I just feel they are just wasted potential here.  I would have enjoyed seening the type of racing like in Midnight Club 3, which is an amazing game made by Rockstar if you didn't know.\n\nA more convinient way of earning a bit of cash is by using F.R.I.M. F.R.I.M is a system that gives you a small amount of money for doing simple things, such as having a near miss with another driver, or constantly drifting. (It gives you $100 dollars when you start, and the money increases then.  I believe the maximum you can get in one run is $10,000.)\n\nAnother way to earn money is to race other drivers you find around the area.  The will have a random name, and flashing you headlights at them will allow you to race them instantly.  You can race the same person until you grow tired of it, so if you find that one person that has no chance of winning, you can make VERY easy money for as long as you please.\n\nNow, for those of you who enjoy driving you valuable vehicles like a sane human being, the cockpit view is very detailed, and flows well with the overall control scheme, and graphical style.  Although, if you hate slow AI drivers, than here's something to note.  TDU2 has some of the dumbest civilian AI I've ever seen.  The are just about the slowest driver AI as well.  You just need to play the game to see.\n\nAnother note, if you want to play this game with a friend, I have some bad news.  Because of the developer studio shutting down, the multiplayer servers went with them.  It's worth searching whether a multiplayer mod will be made for this game, like the one made for Just Cause 2.  (If you have any information on that, please tell me.  I'd be willing to play online with someone.)\n\nWith all that aside, I can't help but go back to this game because of the sharp visuals, and lovely selection of vehicles to choose from.

Example being in interaction with other vehicles on the roads, hit them and you come to a dead stop... take a corner too rough and at least the game forgives a bit and will spin you as expected.\n\nOther glaring faults I consider are that the voice acting leaves a LOT to be desired, the motivation of the characters are extremly questionable, the amount of customization is lacking in variety, & finally the "unlocking" scheme is laughable.\n\nVOICE ACTIING\nvoice acting in just cause 2 was ten times better than this... just mentioning it.\n\nCharacter/Story Development\non a chance encounter mission this lady is at the side of the road in one of the major cities, and decides to ask some yabbo in a VW scirocco to take her Pagani Zonda to the mechanic shop because she doesnt have the time to... oh and dont scratch it...\n\nCustomization\nto be honest i have not even bothered, primarily because the "stickers" are a load of... and the tech shop is really all that is needed... I have not played the game long enough to comment on the impact that owning a mc-mansion has on gameplay nor needing to buy that poolside valet bar stool thingy that apaprently i can impress other TDU2 gamers with... to me this is the equivalent of getting Recon armor in halo, or Bedazzled guns in COD franchise, or worse still a bee in a bottle from Zelda franchise....\n\n\nUnlocking items\nAgain... having not played far enough to really get a sense of what is available I looked forward into FAQS and guides and saw that a player needs to to unlock the privilege to buy cars in game... nuff said... Whatever!!!\n\n\nin conclusion... the only selling point that this game brought to the table that i willingly thought would make it all worth it.. the open world aspect of being able to drive absolutely EVERYWHERE!! thats the only good thing about this worth mentioning...\n\nif you are looking for realism... look elsewhere\nif you are seeking an arcade-ish experience... look elsewhere\nif you want a decent story or plausible real life mimicry... look elsewhere\n\nif you are looking for an open world game that ~~promises a lot of potential~~ to drive various cars around a massive island while in the same time extremely slowly rising through the ranks of a Dubai-esque racing series with possible androids masquerading as humans... then this may be the game for you!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n","February 13, 2014","false","35.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Other than looking at the speedo you can't really gauge or feel how fast you're going. You can't really drift on this game very well, which is stupid since it's something which you can use to earn money within the game. If you lose internet connection it will take you to the title screen and when you attempt to play again it will just make you watch loading screens without actually letting you play... it just takes you back to the title screen after a while because you have no connection (and carries on in a cycle). The online players as well as the pedestrian cars/bikes glitch a lot and jerk forwards like 200 yards up the road at times. I know it's not exactly a brand new game at this point, but the graphics really aren't anything worth shouting about.\n\nIf you have the sort of expectations of this game that I had, i.e. something which offers a good open-world driving experience similar to that of need for speed games, but with more realistic handling, better graphics and the sort of gameplay that wouldn't get boring quickly, you'll be entirely disappointed.\n\nAnd also worth a mention is the pain in the ♥♥♥ installation...\nAFter downloading via steam it not only makes you sign up to their website to create an account for the game (hardly the end of the world, I know, but there's more to come), you have to activate the game with a serial key (something I haven't had to do with any other steam game), when you try to launch the game it will make you download another gigabyte of data (probably files which make the game as crap as it is), which WILL fail to download... at which point you should refer to this:\n\nhttp://support.atari.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/76/0/i-am-receiving-error-5\n\nwhich should fix the problem for you, but in all honesty you'd be better not buying the game and saving yourself the hassle/disappointment","December 21, 2013","false","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"Decent" game.  This coming from someone who's never played the first game, I have mixed feelings, and thoughts about the differences between the two products.  Anyway, I will give you my honest impressions on this game after having it for a year or so.\n\nThis game greets you with absolutely beautiful graphical detail, and very accurate vehicale models.  This game simulates modern, and classic vehicles in a very accurate manner, along with accurate prices too. (Most of the time.)\n\nThere are many ways to earn money in this game, some more convenient than others, some more fun than others.  One is by completing the Solar Crown Championships, which require certain vehicle types to participate in.  Now, let me say this... I DO NOT recommend attending the championships, unless you enjoy completing some of the most repetitive, monotenous acts I've ever seen.  I mean, most of them are common in a lot of racing games today, however, I just feel they are just wasted potential here.  I would have enjoyed seening the type of racing like in Midnight Club 3, which is an amazing game made by Rockstar if you didn't know.\n\nA more convinient way of earning a bit of cash is by using F.R.I.M. F.R.I.M is a system that gives you a small amount of money for doing simple things, such as having a near miss with another driver, or constantly drifting. (It gives you $100 dollars when you start, and the money increases then.  I believe the maximum you can get in one run is $10,000.)\n\nAnother way to earn money is to race other drivers you find around the area.  The will have a random name, and flashing you headlights at them will allow you to race them instantly.  You can race the same person until you grow tired of it, so if you find that one person that has no chance of winning, you can make VERY easy money for as long as you please.\n\nNow, for those of you who enjoy driving you valuable vehicles like a sane human being, the cockpit view is very detailed, and flows well with the overall control scheme, and graphical style.  Although, if you hate slow AI drivers, than here's something to note.  TDU2 has some of the dumbest civilian AI I've ever seen.  The are just about the slowest driver AI as well.  You just need to play the game to see.\n\nAnother note, if you want to play this game with a friend, I have some bad news.  Because of the developer studio shutting down, the multiplayer servers went with them.  It's worth searching whether a multiplayer mod will be made for this game, like the one made for Just Cause 2.  (If you have any information on that, please tell me.  I'd be willing to play online with someone.)\n\nWith all that aside, I can't help but go back to this game because of the sharp visuals, and lovely selection of vehicles to choose from.  The sounds are wonderful, the thrill of have a 1.6 million dollar car keeps you playing, exploring the island(s), and finding landmarks.\n\nWith that said, I do recommend this game, just be aware of some of the "Moments" that the AI has, and some of the short- comings of the physics engine.\n\nI give this game a Seven out of Ten, and I do recommend it to anyone who wants a good-looking, mixture of arcade fun, and realistic simulation.\n\nThank you.\n","June 12, 2014","true","177.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Finally when I got older I had the right mind to build a computer. My specs are more than the requirements for the game. Gameplay wise, the game is exellent. I love the driving expierience, you can buy cars, buy houses, and the free roam is exellent. The car variety is amazing, and the level of detail, and sounds for each car, is amazing. On Xbox at least. I only was able to play for 3 hours on my computer due to how bad the game is. The textures are horrible, things dissapear, and the game freezes. After all that, I figured I would still give the game a chance due to my love for cars, and my great Xbox expierience in the past. However apon start, I was presented with a "Corrupted Savegame" message. Are you kidding me? In the three hours I played, I had over $300,000 and 3 cars. I cant play this game, for the $8 I spent it was not even worth it. I can't even think about playing this game anymore. When I filed a ticket on the Atari website, they responded with "Well you played the game once, so it should be easier to replay it again" How about you and eDen actually fix the god damn problem instead of telling me to go pound sand. Please don't waste your money on this game. There are many other great games that you can buy instead. If you do get the game to work, I envy you, because I wish I could get mine to work.","June 21, 2014","false","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You get the original island of TDU and the new island, so 2 massive islands to drive around.\n\nThe bikes have been added as a DLC and there is not much to choose from to make it a real selection.\n\nGreat thing about the game is that you can drive the original map AND the new map with the game, so it is two huge maps in one game.  I mean huge!\n\nThe graphics are nicely done, the car detail is nice inside and out and with the casino the game adds a great community feature. I have friends who only play the casino which is good.\n\nWhen you done the entire game 100% which will take you some serious hours because it is some serious driving, and if you like driving games with exploring on long roads with nice scenery then this is the game for you.\n\nI 100% the game in some hours, and then spent a massive chunk of time cruising around with friends which is top fun.\n\nI literally have no problems with this game, I enjoy everything about it.\n\nI hope they release a TDU3.  If you enjoy driving games with open world, then you will enjoy this game, and added with friends, makes it even better.  Cruise with some beautiful cars in some really nice scenery.\n\nOne sad thing about the game is that there is not that many people online anymore, really the community is what made the game amazing and now it is extremely quiet I find.\nThere used to be hundreds online playing in the casino, poker matches and so much more...

Just don't expect a lot of variation in the terrain as both Ibiza and Oahu are mostly jungle and urban roads.\n\nThe game provides a LOT of road, but as with many racing games, you have to unlock everything by leveling up certain in game attributes. It can feel like a chore at times, but there is a lot of racing to be had (plus crafting your own races too).\n\nOn the whole, it takes some getting used to, but TDU2 is a fun game if you are just looking to get in a car and drive.","July 4, 2011","true","160.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ibiza is a nice starting area with plenty roads and off road experiences. Hawaii is were it gets more interesting allot more roads and slopes to experience same goes for offroading\nExcellent fun to Trash in certain routes especially with a friend driving around.\n\nDriving experience is very challenging, in a very positive way you can spend hours trial and error certain races/time trials.\nSometimes it does get a bit tedious.\nAnd in a negative way you discover a strange performance optimization, where to un-explained reasons you flip/tumble/roll or other. Even when there is no reason for every now and then the car spins at low speeds in certain hard corners (Like a front wheel locks even modern cars which have ABS now a days this shouldn't be happening) It doesn't happen that much. But watch out for gaps/jumps and what not you need to moderate your speeds here.\n\nHaven't noticed it on Ibiza much (So not sure) but there are some mountain roads on Hawaii that haven't been finisched sadly lots of potentiol but very bumpy, instead of smooth driving. Not many just a few roads are like that and you'll have to find them to experience why.\n\nAlso to do advanced racing tournaments/cups you have to attain licenses all though a great idea, it leaves no margins for error in the sense you have no experience how the car handles and drive blindly the license objectives which are a bit annoying  doable but feels a bit useless. For future iterations these things need to be updated/modernized or something new.\n\nRegardless of all the negative points for me Personally The Driving experience does outweigh the negative aspects of the game. I truly enjoy touring around the islands and trying to find new fun twisties to master.\n\nOnline experience besides driving with a couple of friends haven't really tried the Challenges in a big degree yet also there are allot of players that use mods and what not some with good intentions and others with bad.\n\nIn the end to do everything is this game is a challenge and also a time sink to get the full experience.\nI'm a gamer that usually play's allot of genre's with a few exceptions.","February 7","true","117.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

TDU & TDU2 kind of had that vibe, like you forget you're playing a game at times and can achieve that zen of going for a ride and cranking up your own music and escaping from your everyday life of minivans carting kids around and responsibilities for a while. Not that I don't enjoy my life, but these kinds of games are experiences and not just adrenalin fueled arcade games.\n\nToo bad the mixed reviews are due to internet issues, because this should still be one of the top rated games here, even with The Crew and and all of it's DLC and online play.\n\n","February 7","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Atari are getting on top of this now. To be honest this game is good. But it had so much potential which it will never be able to achieve. When slapped on hardcore its a good fun racing game. The story and voice over are awful and I dont like how your character can only look like a metrosexual mess that just fell out of Paris Hiltons limo. The freedriving is really good and the motorbikes are great fun. All in all its a great game with some bugs.

It uses a third party DRM which isn't at all hard to use, it's just five to ten minutes to make an account, sign in once and you're done.\n\n7.8/10 Great with friends, but when you're playing Single Player it can get repetitive and boring.","January 1, 2015","true","8.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You get the original island of TDU and the new island, so 2 massive islands to drive around.\n\nThe bikes have been added as a DLC and there is not much to choose from to make it a real selection.\n\nGreat thing about the game is that you can drive the original map AND the new map with the game, so it is two huge maps in one game.  I mean huge!\n\nThe graphics are nicely done, the car detail is nice inside and out and with the casino the game adds a great community feature. I have friends who only play the casino which is good.\n\nWhen you done the entire game 100% which will take you some serious hours because it is some serious driving, and if you like driving games with exploring on long roads with nice scenery then this is the game for you.\n\nI 100% the game in some hours, and then spent a massive chunk of time cruising around with friends which is top fun.\n\nI literally have no problems with this game, I enjoy everything about it.\n\nI hope they release a TDU3.  If you enjoy driving games with open world, then you will enjoy this game, and added with friends, makes it even better.  Cruise with some beautiful cars in some really nice scenery.\n\nOne sad thing about the game is that there is not that many people online anymore, really the community is what made the game amazing and now it is extremely quiet I find.\nThere used to be hundreds online playing in the casino, poker matches and so much more...

Several years later I had all but forgotten it’s existence when suddenly it popped up in the steam winter sale. What perfect timing! I was itching for a good open world driving game and along comes one that I had wanted so badly on sale for just a few bucks.\nWell 10 hours later my itch is gone, but TDU2 makes a terrible scratcher. I’m not sure if I would have been as disappointed had I picked up the game in its prime, but with the multiplayer non-existent and the game itself being an absolute nightmare to install and get running due to the servers being neglected for the past 3 or 4 years, there is little left to be loved about this game. It’s really cool to see all the car brands licensed and buying houses to decorate definitely appeals to the Sims lover in me, but finding the dealers is a pain and the game world is unfathomably massive. It’s fun to drive and the cars handle well, but the amount of mundane driving about you end up doing causes your eyes to glaze over. By the 8th or 9th hour of play I found myself watching Netflix while I systematically scour a city for a particular dealer or make my way across the world to a different race. At that point I realized it just wasn't that fun and I uninstalled it.","February 9, 2015","false","11.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Don't be fooled by this. They have added many features to the game including challenges, cars, classes of cars and many other things. I really enjoy the fact that after you get so far in Ibiza (a decent sized island), you get to fly to Hawaii to race (not sure which island). And man, that island is larger than you think. It took me 45 minutes to an hour to drive from the airport (northwest) to the southeast coast and it was at full speed (driving an Audi TTS, averaging 140-150 mph) in real time. I love the fact that you can fully explore everything on the island.\n\nA few things this game lacks: voice acting, variety of voice acting, better multiplayer matches and/or support, Atari member support, and the issue with the fact that I completed 7 DLC missions and went in today to see I completed ZERO. Annoying to start over again. So a few issues still exist. If you can find this game on sale and you love the free roam exploring aspect, buy it!","September 21, 2014","true","22.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Don't be fooled by this. They have added many features to the game including challenges, cars, classes of cars and many other things. I really enjoy the fact that after you get so far in Ibiza (a decent sized island), you get to fly to Hawaii to race (not sure which island). And man, that island is larger than you think. It took me 45 minutes to an hour to drive from the airport (northwest) to the southeast coast and it was at full speed (driving an Audi TTS, averaging 140-150 mph) in real time. I love the fact that you can fully explore everything on the island.\n\nA few things this game lacks: voice acting, variety of voice acting, better multiplayer matches and/or support, Atari member support, and the issue with the fact that I completed 7 DLC missions and went in today to see I completed ZERO. Annoying to start over again. So a few issues still exist. If you can find this game on sale and you love the free roam exploring aspect, buy it!","September 21, 2014","true","22.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you don't, keep in mind that this game is pretty much single player.\n\nThe good:\nCruising, open world, racing, lots of cars, lots of roads, customization of avatar and car, basic tuning of cars, houses, the old tdu 1 map, the new map, offroad vehicles, motorcycles are back, and day/night & weather cycling, random encounters with some online people will result in a nice group cruise or legit race.\n\nThe bad:\nMainly a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ contest between most people even in open world cruising, massive amounts of cheating, cheating, more cheats, cheaters trying to impress others by cheating, cheaters trying to annoy others by cheating, dated graphics, limited tuning options (especially gear ratios), limited suspension and grip preferences for off road vehicles, and a bunch of dlc that is not worth it.\n\nI boot this game up for a casual experience and don't plan on taking it too seriously. I still find myself having fun with it doing my own thing and meeting good people while blocking or un-linking from the dips that have issues they need to sort out on their own time. Knowing this, I can't recommend this game to anyone that wants to race online, have a fun experience with all the dynamics of this game, or play this game as it was originally intended.\n\nAlso, all the leader boards are jacked up. Top scores dominated by cheaters soon after the game was released. There are plenty of other solid games out there for racing/cruising/tuning.\n\n\nA typical experience for many:\n\nRun into a stop sign: no problem. Run into a tiny bush with flowers on it: brick wall. Decide you want to get off the road and cruise the HUGE open terrain? Sweet. Find out how difficult it is to navigate around most terrain with all the "obstacles". Finally find a nice open space to floor it. See tall wheat fields and want to frolic through them;-- stopped by a tiny wooden fence hidden in the wheat. Turn around and go back into the wilderness and punch it. Yay; car stopped dead in it's tracks by a boulder hidden by a one foot tall patch of grass. Give up and go back onto the road to giv'r. Floor it. About to hit top speed; a car spawns out of nowhere 15 ft in front of you. Decide to just cruise; a random player online decides to turn on tank mod and harass you a bit or show you how fast he/she can go and get you to ride coop to be amazed. Decide to jump to a new location; can't sync with anyone. Being lonely, you decide to take a break, call your mom, call your gf, call your dad, call your brothers/sisters, smoke it up, eat, take a poo, check your phone, take a nap, take another poo, and then boot it up in hopes of it syncing with others; 3 people online and all afk.

Several years later I had all but forgotten it’s existence when suddenly it popped up in the steam winter sale. What perfect timing! I was itching for a good open world driving game and along comes one that I had wanted so badly on sale for just a few bucks.\nWell 10 hours later my itch is gone, but TDU2 makes a terrible scratcher. I’m not sure if I would have been as disappointed had I picked up the game in its prime, but with the multiplayer non-existent and the game itself being an absolute nightmare to install and get running due to the servers being neglected for the past 3 or 4 years, there is little left to be loved about this game. It’s really cool to see all the car brands licensed and buying houses to decorate definitely appeals to the Sims lover in me, but finding the dealers is a pain and the game world is unfathomably massive. It’s fun to drive and the cars handle well, but the amount of mundane driving about you end up doing causes your eyes to glaze over. By the 8th or 9th hour of play I found myself watching Netflix while I systematically scour a city for a particular dealer or make my way across the world to a different race. At that point I realized it just wasn't that fun and I uninstalled it.","February 9, 2015","false","11.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

As far as single player goes; it's a great driving game if you like time trials or just relaxing cross country driving. Singleplayer races aren't very difficult because the ai is pretty easy but a lot of the time trials and other solo challenges are fairly fun and some will require some practice. Singleplayer isn't too special, though. It's not bad but the game was clearly designed with multiplayer as the main focus.\n\nBecause as for the multiplayer.. You're given the choice to either play online or offline when creating and in-game profile. If you choose to play online then you'll seemlessly see other players driving around the island that you can use voice or text chat with. Challenging other players is encouraged since you get rank points for doing things such as adding people to your friend list or doing challenges with others. There's also ai police that drive around which will get upset if you act malicious towards other drivers. Being too much of a bully will put you into a police chase and if any other players are nearby, they'll be given the choice of getting a police car and being sent after you. The fun of this feature is partially off-set by how most players drive Bugatti's and other supercars making them hard to catch but it's still a nice tough. You can also bet money against others in these challenges which adds a little more purpose.\n\nOne of the best parts of the game that shines is the world compared to other driving/racing games. You're given two detailed recreations of both Ibiza and Oahu. In a lot of cases you can actually use a real map to help navigate both of the islands. There's all sorts of roads and highways and rural trails that you can drive on, and if you really want to you can just drive off the road completely. There's no invisible walls keeping you from driving off the road and nearly every mountain has a way to the top if your car can handle the slopes (and there are cars specifically meant for offroading.)\nTo top of the world's detail.. You can go into various shops and buy clothes or haircuts or cosmetic surgery. You can walk into dealer ships to look at cars in detail and buy them and you can even buy houses and apartments. If you're playing online, you'll also see other players walking around in the public areas, otherwise you can invite them into your home for shenanigans. Here in 2015, it's no GTA Online but it's still wonderful if you're looking for a more relaxed environment where someone won't try to blow you up every few minutes. Also the soundtrack is pretty chill and varied.\n\nWith that said, it's pretty much a recreational driving MMO with no monthly subscription and a cash shop that only consists of a few completely optional cars that only cost around a dollar each to unlock (the DLC only unlocks them; you still have to pay for them with ingame money so it still retains a degree of balance.) The only DLC that's mandatory for certain features is the Casino DLC which lets you gamble and win a Casino-exlusive car, and the motorcycle DLC. But seeing as DLC is very cheap, it's not too big of a deal.\n\nTl;dr buy it if you wanna kill time with cars and endless roads. You get a ton of that pricetag of $20..\nThough, keep in mind that some people have a hard time setting up the mandatory account with Atari.\nOnce you get past that, you're in for a good time.","March 21, 2015","true","109.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","3"

WIth a lot of missons, many ways to earn money, and the ability to cruise in your favourite car - it sure is a game worth putting time into, and has a lot of replayability too.\n\nPersonally, I love this game. I bought it for my PS3 because I heard it was buggy for the PC (at the time) - but now that it's not too buggy, and you can actually start the game up, it's a great game that I don't regret paying the full price (£14.99 currently) for... at all.\n\nHonestly, if you love your cars/autos like me, get it. You won't regret it.\n\nOverall, good job Atari! (No, you didn't read that wrong)","March 10, 2015","true","25.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It differs from other racing games as its not focused on racing but more on exploration. Its kind of like Euro Truck Simulator, Most people find it boring and non-exciting but I feel that its just a game designed to make you relax and explore Oahu and Ibiza. This game has recieved some negativity due to its broken CD keys and "constant" server maintainance but I have never recieved any problems like this and I still find it enjoyable. Its a pity that the community has slowly faded away as its quite an old game but still a great legend.","April 26, 2015","true","18.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

I think I'm mostly done with trying this game so here it goes\n\n`Pros\nGreat attention to detail. Inside cars and outside, can roll downwindows, turn blinkers odwn adjust roof, and paint your car however you live it to look. There is a big world, with lots of places to max your car or drive it. This game has a great immersion when playing it, and it beats any other open world experiences I had with any other game so far. Loved the story with it, starting off poor, building your way up, and getting better cars.\n\n`cons\nThe driving is a bit un learnable. It feels like you try to tuen somewhere and a second or 2 later it starts to happen, then you start to slip off a little. Turning feels half ♥♥♥♥♥ in the way that it makes driving not fun. Drifting is a bit weird as well considering that you don't really know what the car wants to do. The map being huge is great, but theres no way to get placers quicker. Too big to get around. Pick the wrong car, go off too far, your screwed. Some places there is too much unused map, like it will just be filled with a bumpy field, or blocked off,or trees.\n\n\nOverall if you could deal with the handeling the only thing i would complain about is the damage model. Seems like a game eaither is too focused on it and leaves out alot of other needed freedom and content, or there is hardly any attention it in, like in this game and it's not even noticable when you crash going 100.","July 15, 2014","false","15.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I've spent 2 weeks (every day) trying to get this game to work and still can't make it work.\n\nFirst issue I had was Atari's UPlauncher updates were conflicting with Steam and Steam would not allow the game to run without it's own updates installed but Atari kept overwriting it. Atari's solution, instead of releasing a patch, they just posted a workaround in their screwed up website which didn't help me at all, Steam also gave advice on how to fix the issue which also didn't work for me. I ended up resorting to trying a third party launcher which bypasses that b.s. and force the game to just launch, which it did but then crashes at the first windowed loading screen giving me a choice to send an error report which brings me to...\n\nSecond issue. I tried fixing that windowed loading screen crash by downloading a non-steam version of the game through torrent and just using my legit key for it, tried old cracked offline version, tried old legit (non-cracked) offline version, tried up-to-date legit (non-cracked) online version, none of them could get passed the windowed loading screen. And this issue has no solution at all for it. Both Atari and Steam have not mentioned anything about this issue. I tried contacting Atari several times through their website support page but every time I clicked submit, an error page kept coming up so even their website is screwed up... so unprofessional of them to do this.\n\nMy computer more than meets the minimum requirements for this game and yet it does not work at all for a lot of ppl including myself. This is by far the most broken game I have ever had to deal with so far. Wasted my money on a game that cannot be played no matter how much I try to fix their problems.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that although I was able to receive my cd key fine, thousands of ppl right now can't get their key because Steam ran out of them and Atari doesn't care to make more because I think their business is shut down or something... so this game is in such rough condition that it probably should never have been developed by Atari at all and released on Steam in this condition. This game had a lot of potential and could have been so much more as most reviewers have pointed out, but Atari killed it.\n\nEDIT: Hmm... all of a sudden it works now... no conflicts with Steam and no crashes... after I had given up trying to fix it. Will completely redo this review later when I have some play time.\n\nEDIT: Ugh... it stopped working again... like... seriously?\n\nEDIT: got it working after realizing it was conflicting with an fps counter called Riva Tuner (comes with my video card drivers)... will edit this review later. But I still don't have nice things to say about the game though.","January 7, 2014","false","8.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

The few who get banned return instantly to ruin other people's games. CRC mode (challenges made by players for players) was made extinct because of this. There goes 33% replayability content of what this game was supposed to offer.\n\n- The game is on life support and held together by dry tape. A mere skeleton crew is running the servers which goes down a lot, A LOT, without any warning; you never get noticed in advance or told when it will be back up like any other well-kept game does. This was common since the beginning when they dared charge $50 for this mess. I expect Atari to pull the plug on the server unannounced very soon and you end up with an unplayable game. Some say to play it in offline mode, but what is the point of promoting an MMO (or M.O.O.R. as Atari wanted to hype it) if it is so extremely unreliable and offline a lot?  Its online feature is supposed to be a big selling point, yet it fails; oh how it fails at this. The online feature of this game is very uncertain.\n\n- Atari has behaved very unprofessional towards its customers this entire time, we get no proper feedback, no messages when the servers go down, the official forums have died a long time ago, support tickets go unanswered etc.\n\n- Your save game file is stored LOCALLY on your PC, not online. It can go corrupt at any random moment due to faulty programming, so you are expected to make a manual backup everytime you play. Doesn't happen to everybody but it happens often enough to many people in general that this is a huge game-breaking bug that was never fixed.\n\n- Difficult to play with friends due to the random 8-player session system. I had a 25% success rate to join my friends at all. Eventually they all left, I don't blame them.\n\n- After you finish the game (I did this within 1 month after release) earning money is no longer fun. It's a tedious repetitive boring grind-fest. What were they thinking removing bomb mission after you do them? They gave the game diversity at least. (they weren't thinking really, I can't list all the many bad game design decisions but they are MANY!)\n\n- No big secret here, the physics are awful awful awful. Some cars behaviour is just unexplainable. Collision reaction is just as buggy. This is an arcade car game, well it sure doesn't control as such. It feels like the air was let out of the tires. The Burnout series, the Midnight Club series, the older Need for Speed series, these are all CORRECT arcade physics games. Heh, even TDU1 has better physics. What the hell happened here in this sequel?\n\n- The AI in single player races is a joke. Your rival AI opponent rubberbands around you no matter how good or bad you drive, the rest always stay far behind. This is a big contrast to the extremely hard (& pointless) driving school sessions which may block you early at the start of the game for the average gamer. Don't be fooled what others say, you will not become a better driver by finishing them, just relived that you passed those frustration-fests.\n\n- The Sims elements is not a good meaningful addition. You will giggle about it at first, but soon it loses its luster and meaning. This is a car game, you won't be seeing your character or your houses indoors for most of the time. It was a waste of time and resources developing this Sims stuff. The time would have been better spent finalizing other more useful game features (which are broken or simply not there).\n\n- What made TDU1 good has been removed from TDU2. (too many to list here). Many steps backwards were taken.\n\n- Don't let the biased Metacritic score fool you.  That score is based on the launch condition the game was in (wasn't good back then either) and the positive thinking expectations of what it would become. Well, as time passed, the game got worse and worse. More errors/bugs were introduced instead of fixed. Force feedback got broken, innocent people getting marked as cheaters (their cars turn into Pink Mustangs), casino DLC getting more buggier, etc etc.\n\nGOOD games promise XYZ, and deliver XYZ.\nTDU2 promised XYZ, it delivered only X. (the goal-less cruising). The people who like X are the only ones who like this game and treat it like it's the best thing ever. That's a terrible way to review/recommend a product to others. You review THE WHOLE package, not just the part you like.\nNot everybody plays an openworld game for the same reasons, since you know, openworld games offer a lot of varied gameplay. But like I said, this openworld only offers X, nothing more. That makes it a very limited openworld game. TDU1 did deliver all its promised XYZ.  So if you want to cruise offline, go play that instead. It has better working finished content. Atari, or what is left of it, doesn't deserve any money from TDU2.\n\nI can only guess how many unfortunate people followed such biased misinformation and bought this thing only to rage-quit soon afterwards, having wasted their time and money. For every 1 satisfied player in this game, you will find 9 others who hate it. Just check twitter, facebook, etc etc (even these are practically dead). You will see a lot of hate, very little praise.","April 28, 2014","false","144.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

Really? You can't even update your forums... Have you completely left this buggy crap behind, and KEEP IT ON THE STEAM STORE? Now lets get past the starting and whenever I enter the game and hit enter to get past the login screen, to my complete suprise NOTHING HAPPENS... You sit there watching the camera move around showing you scenery in a ENDLESS LOOP... I bought this game and it is completely unplayable. Then finding out that when you watch the scenery for a good 3-4 minutes it says the servers are unavaliable... It will NOT let you play right out of the box. It is taking more space on my hardrive then this game is actually worth... You should not have to jump through hoops to play a game you pay money for.

Furthermore this is not a racing game, yes you can drive cars around, but the racing aspect in this game is just half baked. TDU2 is Eden Games attempt at emulating face-book in a pseudo-racing genre. The sad part is that your avatar/house is more customizable than your car. This games physics engine also appears to be absent. You can ram in to trucks all day, the only visible damage you will have on your car is dirt and a couple scratches.

The game is terrible from the very first game car handling is out the window and is just stiff and arcady, vehicle sounds are awful mostly to me seem re used for every car but higher pitched for high end cars, the island looks ok not upgraded in visuals over TD1 as I would of thought.\n\nThe story is awful your car parker guy who starts off dreaming he's been giving a Ferrari which turns out the woman who gives you it it nothing but the real owner of the car???, who then thinks she is punishing you by driving her to her destination because she's going to be late okkkkkkkkkkkk. The voice acting is terrible really poor like they just used the own devs creating the game to give the samples to save money, your player while driving the car is as stiff as a bloke getting a rectal exam it's beyond a joke.\n\nBut it's the installation of the game thats a right royal pain in the backside for anyone installing it now it still has secuROM whch to me is pointless considering Atari really ain't around anymore and sometimes the online are up or down. With this game registering through STEAM why bother with SecuROM what's the point really I will be always baffled as to why games carry such things when you need to be signed into STEAM for most games they could of just gave it an always online system. In todays games we mostly are always online for multiplayer but I don't think a game like this really needs SecuROM, it took me about 30 mins to understand what to do to activate the dam game basically you copy and paste the CD KEY into the box provided to activate it and your LIMITED to 4 yes 4 ACTIVATIONS which you can earn back when you remove it but again this system is just pointless.","January 6, 2015","false","2.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Stunning graphics, they deserve all the backing for this game so you should definitely buy it to support them; after all  that's how indie games work right? A few bugs that these guys could change like when you reverse, but when a game is made in some nerd's garage what do you expect, you dig? The gameplay overall is quite good, however going online is not so good because you have to make an online account and can't switch an offline account to online, but when a game is made in some nerd's garage what do you expect, you dig? Personally the lack of many  classic cars is a downer for me, but when a game is made in some nerd's garage what do you expect, you dig? These indies really know how to make a game and would recommend any day. 9/10, would certainly Cormier again. The last thing I want to get to is the crashing. It sometimes crashed when using the map to teleport from place to place, but when a game is made in some nerd's garage what do you expect, you dig? That should bring us to the end of my review, thanks. Not much choice of rims is another problem I found with this game, but when a game is made in some nerd's garage what do you expect, you dig? A problem I probably should have mentioned earlier as it's quite big, is that there is a fatal lack of jumping ability when acting as the avatar, but when a game is made in some nerd's garage what do you expect, you dig? Among other problems there arises a few that are also rather grand and should definitely be seen to by this indie developer when he/she has the time. One of these is the fact that all the male characters when starting off look rather camp and are thin; standards that I think nobody should have to try to meet. This also goes for the women in the game, as they are portrayed very sexually at times, especially when washing one's car, and I think that this kind of material should not be viewed by anyone under the age of 13, but when a game is made in some nerd's garage what do you expect, you dig? However, my respect goes out to this indie developer who did take the liberty to include an option to make your character of a different ethnicity; my personal choice is black. Another problem I found when playing this game is the fact that the in game birds will not seem to land on my yacht, but when a game is made in some nerd's garage what do you expect, you dig? One problem I encountered much to my dismay, was that there are no Ferrari tuners! Picture this, I drive out of the virtual showroom with my shiny new Ferrari, just to find out that I can't tune it to be the best it can be! But when a game is made in some nerd's garage what do you expect, you dig? Here is a list of cars I wish they would include in this game, and hopefully it will be seen by indie developer 'Atari' so that he/she can add them:\n> Lamborghini Miura\n> Mazda 3\n> Ford GT\n> Dodge Viper\n> The Ford Escort from Fast and Furious 6\n> Supermarine Spitfire MK26b\n\nThe final thing I want to address is the lack of all and any pimp shops. The sort that people go to to get sick new gold and blue rims, a green pearl paintjob, lower their suspension dramatically, and increase their overall pimpiality, but when a game is made in some nerd's garage what do you expect, you dig? Also can you add sandwiches please because I think my avatar is hungry.","August 2, 2014","true","71.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I've finished it twice on the ps3 and 5 times on the pc. Not really the version on steam but when I got the one on my desktop I played it soo much. Imaging gta v without violence. I love this game. Yeah the driving isn't the best, but this game is meant for the story and lifestyle and just the freedom you get. I love how you can go to the casino and buy so many wonderfully designed cars in an actual dealership. I love when games get taken to real life. You can even customize your furniture!!! The side missions are just incredible. The views and landscapes you see are just wonderful. This games races and story is really good imo. And just the radio, the airport the communication and just everything is wonderful. And just Ibiza alone has a liftime full of gameplay with this game but theirs an island 3 times bigger.... Hawaii which is soooooo big and lets you explore just so much. It's honestly an incredible game. I honestly get this game isn't up to par with recent games but for 2011 damn dude. This is amazing. And it's 2015 and I still play it. This game is my favourite game of all time. Really close to a few other sims and gta v and a few other but this game is just wonderful in my taste. This is a game made to last. Sadly no tdu3 but this is enough.

You can play with the keyboard, but some of the Driving License tests are nearly impossible with the keyboard (but are really easy with the controller).\n\nPositive:\n+ Lots of licensed Cars\n+ GIANT maps (aprox. 1 real hour to lap around the first island)\n+ Cool interaction with the cars in the garage/dealer (open doors, turn on indicator, opening door windows, honking, test-drive, etc)\n+ Very detailed car models\n+ The Arcade style driving is actually fun and not stupid-impossible like some other famous games\n\nThe negative points:\n- Last time I played all the bikes were DLC (you can test-drive them though)\n- The voice acting and humans models are dreadful  (that's ok with me, not the focus at all)\n- There's only 2 radios and they're both annoying (I used to turn the music off and playing something better on my stereo)\n- There's some bizarre physics acting (especially in high-speeds)","June 27, 2014","true","36.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The cars dont handle well really, kind of arcadey whereas it really should be more simulation based. Also, you cant upgrade the cars properly, it is more of a level system and finally there arent proper assists like tc, abs or whatever, it is a 3 level system of max, medium and low assists that arent very good as you cant properly turn of tc and drive an ariel atom sideways down a motorway like i wanted to do, however you cant.

Also, you cant upgrade the cars properly, it is more of a level system and finally there arent proper assists like tc, abs or whatever, it is a 3 level system of max, medium and low assists that arent very good as you cant properly turn of tc and drive an ariel atom sideways down a motorway like i wanted to do, however you cant.

Even Ubisoft would of done a better job porting it over.\n\nHere are a few of the things that really get to me about the game;\nThe speech- It's so so cheesy, the entire game is voice acted out by actors that I can only assume have never heard a human speak.\nThe cars- There's a few, yeah I'll grant it that.

I got this when it originally came out and, at first, had some fun. However, the emphasis on online play, the buggy engine, the twitchy driving, and the purely frustrating races eventually overcame whatever fun factor I thought was present. This is a tedious game - the open world that they tout is boring and half is copied from the previous game. Controls are terrible - a tap in the wrong direction can spell disaster, especially on the missions to bring the car intact somewhere on the island. The free driving can be fun, but is ultimately pointless - there's little to see and few things to do. If this is on a sale and you really love racing games and its dirt cheap, grab it for a few hours of fun. Otherwise, give this one a big miss.","June 3, 2015","false","113.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But then it stopped working. It would crash at a load screen and would not go into the game. But for the time I played I enjoyed this game the storyline is pretty good. The world is very nice looking. I enjoyed doing races and I thought it was cool how you could go into stores and buy your own home. If you had a supercar and a mansion you were living the luxury life! So overall I enjoyed this game but I WARN you that it doesn't work for me anymore because it crashed. So I would rate this game with the crashing a 7/10. If this games had no problems with crashing I would rate it a 8.7/10","June 1, 2015","true","16.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There is enough content for way more than 40 hours\nThere are 2 impressively sized maps, various car dealers, hairdressers, clothing shops, houses, sticker shops. All this expand it and turn it into much more then just a racing game\nFor single player, theres career mode with 5 different types of events. Theres side missions, Dlc missions, you can spend your time exploring locations, taking photos or finding car wrecks.\nJoining or creating MP events wont be easy, as expected, not that there are people still playing, i always came across 7 players in each map, granted they don't have any other choice then to play online\nBoth cars and locations look fairly decent, the interiors of the vehicles are incredibly detailed\nIts also fairly cheap\nCons: (where to begin)\nI dont even know how to describe the plot is. Its...you know how GTA is a Satire? well, TDU2 is the exact opposite.\nHave you ever wanted to race against Paris Hilton and her friends? yeah...me neither. The fact that your character takes part in this consumerist culture is baffling\nCharacter animations are terrible\nawful voice actors, that seem to have recorded their lines by phone\nInconsistent Physics\nSome objects have the wrong hitbox size\nSome of the vehicles can only be unlocked with real money, all of the motorcycles have to be unlocked with real money, there's a casino that also requires, you guessed it, real money, all that locked content put together is far more expensive then the game itself\nSome locations have absolutely nothing other than grass, i hope you like the colour green\nNo good music\nSome of the side missions make zero sense\nDumb AI, not being able to provide you a challenge is not even the biggest issue, having missions that require you to follow someone and AI is so broken they cant even find the right road, now that's a big problem\nTraffic can't spawn when you drive over 300 km/h\nnecessary to change controller settings, it's practically unplayable has is\n\nYou know what?

Driving physics are poor, the story (what I bothered playing of it) seemed really cliché, the voice acting is awful and the story forces itself onto you when you just wanna drive around and explore. When on top of this, the game has poor support for steering wheels, then the end result is so poor I actually just deleted the game from my account.

You've got acces to a big stash of cars, which you obviously have to buy with the in-game money you make. The cars themselves are very detailed, extrior and intrior.\n\nThe roads you can ride on are big and amazing. Every country has it's own style (Ibiza, (Spain) and Hawaii). There are a lot of side activities to do, so that you can earn a good load of money and buy your dream car.\n\nAlthough there won't be any new updates, the game works pretty fine and has some DLC cars (where you have to pay for (Atari coins)).\n\nLike every game it has it's weak spots, and there are still things unfinished, bugged, missing etc..

But it has somewhat that you may have very fun (maybe the european approach made the game seems like that).\n\nIt is an open-world driving game. As a valet driver, you basically do a bulk of events (including driving permission tests) from where you earn cash and experience. You have to win all the regional events (each one ends as a challenge against one of your rivals) in order to match a final "island grand cup", both in Ibiza and Hawaii islands (starting on first one).\n\nThe soundtrack and the scenario modeling are the superb things. It is a very nice environment, beautifully shaped. But the character modeling is pretty bad, although (both graphically and about dialogues).\n\nThe gameplay is reasonable. With a "PS2-like controller", you will have all the controls you need. The game is responsive and controlling the car is relatively easy. Maybe game menus are a little tricky sometimes, but it is a thing easily to be used to.\n\nThe game has a overall moderate challenging factor. The simulation factor is not high. You cannot make a turn reckessly with your car in some categories, but when you master that (it's a little hard), you beat all championships easily. Maybe the greatest difficulty of game is finding the right car for the right event. Besides each model and its features, you must find the brand's sellers through the HUGE scenarios. There are many of the great high-level car brands (some are missing, likely due lack of agreements with manufacturers). You must explore both islands to complete the tasks given to you, find shops, enter championships and even to find multiplayer spots.\n\nYou can customize your character (clothes and plastic surgery), your car (tuning, painting and so on) and the houses/manors you can buy.\n\nBy the way, multiplayer is gradually being abandoned, but you will find people doing some weird things (like races that the fastest lap was one second...).\n\nThe DLC's are not recommended. A couple of cars (not available in-game and has nothing effectively different from what you can purchase on the scenarios' stores) and a Casino that you may earn some cash to buy things. Both are expensive.\n\nYou may have some fun. It's not a mind-blow. The game has a soft and relaxing mood sometimes due it's soundtrack and the locations chosen. Maybe it was intentional.","April 18, 2014","true","105.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The choices are endless and the gameplay is slick, addictive and keeps you coming back for more. Completing challenges keeps the game valid and interesting. The enonomy system in the game adds a nice twist by allowing the player to progress through a scale of ten levels based on their current speed and driving skill (any colisions reduce the bank back to zero). This encourages better driving and allows you to build up money quite easily. Cars and houses can be purchased too.

There are a large variety of cars to earn and drive. The bad area of this game is the story. Cheesy voice acting and useless plot. But the gameplay mechanics really avoid that and makes the game enjoyable. The online is really empty since joining races can be a pain. This game is really fun and I recommend anyone to play this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anima_metentis/recommended/9930/","anima_metentis","Frenzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anima_metentis/","286 products in account","Possibly the best racing game out there. The thing that makes this game so much better than the rest is the freedom you get. The world is massive, containing two islands; Ibiza and Hawaii, both with full asphalt and dirt roads, so if driving on paved roads gets a little boring, you can change it up a bit and go offroading. There are quite a few cars in the game, which means that there is a fair amount of variety when choosing your car(s).\n\nThere are a few problems with the game. There is no option for a clutch without a racing wheel, so you can only go automatic or sequential. I highly recommend getting a gamepad because some of the cars will slide about with the arrow keys. Also when compared to Test Drive Unlimited (prequel), the police in this are suicidal. In TDU they simply try to surround you and bring you to the side of the road, whereas in this the objective is to ram you until you are stuck between a tree and 3 cops, and have to give up.\n\nOtherwise the game is brilliant. Definitely recommend buying it if you are into racing games.","January 8, 2014","true","21.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
