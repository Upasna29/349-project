"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BygPhattyPlus/recommended/275310/","BygPhattyPlus","Byg Willy Regal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BygPhattyPlus/","477 products in account","Being both a ship fan (both naval AND sci-fi) and a steampunk fan, I smiled at the idea of this game and quickly slapped it onto my wish list, which then my friend got for me for Christmas.  I really should have looked at the reviews first.\n\nGraphics:\nThe ship models themselves look nice, but that's it.  The skies all look bland and the water has no real detail except for the reflection of the ships and sky.  The damage the ships take only amounts to brun marks, tattered flags (the flags that ALL point in the same direction ALL the time) and fire.  There are no break models, so when a ship is destroyed, it just sinks.  Also, there are NO graphic options.  No resolution choice, no graphics scailer, nothing.\n\nSound:\nThe sound seems fine except, for me, it is tied to where the camera is in relation to the ship, and if you're off center, the sound ALL comes from one speaker.  The music quickly gets boring.  Also, THERE IS NO VOLUME CONTROL TO SPEAK OF!  The sound literally jars you unless you turn your computer's sound down!\n\nControls:\nYou don't get to actually DO anything except control the game speed (slow, less slow), ship speed and ship direction.  And it takes several seconds for the game to repsond to those commands.  I am not sure if this was an oversight or intended for more realism, but it does this game NO favors.  Also, having NO control over your weapons ensures that you will just sit there, occasionally toggling controls and waiting for something to happen.\n\nGameplay:\nWHAT GAMEPLAY!?  All you do is pick a battle, pick a side, see a little paragraph about it, and then you are thrown into the battle.  NO ship or fleet customization, no weapon setups, nothing.  You get what you get and hope that you move just right for ships to think about firing.  And then you play the waiting game until soemthing happens.  Most of the time, it's either your ships or the enemy ships running away.  I have no clue what triggers this, but it happens often.  You lose control of that ship and watch it run off to do God knows what, leaving you do fend for yourself.  One by one, your ships flee.  I would guess it is because of damage, but since there is no way to fix damage or anything, it's just a matter of praying that more of their ships flee than yours; and also praying that they don't decide to stay around and keep shooting, which they are prone to do.  Your ships MAY also come running back, but will more often than not, just sit sail by and give your the middle finger.  Most battles take the ENTIRE hour and a half time limit (if not most of it) and after it's over, you feel like you just sat there, screaming at a movie and not a game.\n\nAll in all, avoid this game and ALL of Toten Game's lineup (reviews on this games mirror the sentiment of this review).  There are battle naval combat games available on Steam.","December 28, 2014","false","3.0"," 63 of 65 people (97%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","97","63","65","6","0"

Please, for the love of whatever God is left in the universe, do not buy this game. It is a waste of 20 valuable dollars. Think about what you could do with that 20!

I was excited when I saw the screen shots of the ship models... but that turned out to be the only positive about the game. The controls are EXTREMELY limited and there is no setting area to change them. Also, you can only choose to fight 6 or so battles. As for the battles themselves... they consist of the player watching helplessly as your ships fire small puffs of white smoke at the enemy with sound effects which fail to bring about any form of excitement.","June 21, 2014","false","0.2"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","26","28","0","2"

So, I picked a battle, and had no idea what I was supposed to do. I turns out that your only options are telling the ship formations (not even individual ships) to speed up, slow down, go left, or go right. Then, you sit back and watch them beat the crap out of each other. That's it. I walked away from the computer during a battle for 15 minutes and came back because there was nothing for me to do.\n\nIt is a fascinating time period, and I'm going to force myself to play the scenarios so I can get some hint of my money's worth. If you're a fan of that period, then $3 might be worth the price, but not more than that.","May 18, 2014","false","0.6"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","1"

When I first saw this series it seemed like a brilliant idea, ironclad vs ironclad hasn't really been done before but the game is completly uninished and has a complete lack of almost evreything. It takes forever to play even a single engagement, you can't control your guns, you can only control a few ships at a time not the whole fleet, no custom battles or even any customisation of the game at all, you can't even get a list of the key bindings and in all honesty I baught this at 90% off on a steam sale. I wish I hadn't waisted my money.
