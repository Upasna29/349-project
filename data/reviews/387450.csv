The gameplay is so boring that you have to pay (a lot) for the option to not do the battles. Those that have not paid up enough (it won't tell you how much) to reach "VIP 4" actually have to watch the same boring battles over and over. Battles proceed on auto run so at least you can play another (real) game while this game runs.\n\nI did get to past L30 in order to see all of the content, but gameplay really doesn't improve later on. There are about 50 players in guilds on the one server. They are in 4 maxed out guilds (12 players each) and those are mostly non-English guilds. So you won't have any "grouping" options, not that this would make any difference. As in almost all Chinese MMORPG's, you "win" the game by spending more real money on avatars than your opponents. At "VIP 10" you get an orange con avatar which puts the game in easy mode. I would assume this costs $5000+.","August 15, 2015","false","45.1"," 168 of 180 people (93%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","93","168","180","11","0"

Well because they literally stole all the art assets from HoMM5 and made a "game" out of them and when I say game what I mean is the usual tripe that passes as a pay2win game.\n\nInterestingly this game actually shows you how much money people have spent in-game, the #1 player has so far spent $1700 and if you think he is an anomally, an outlier if you will, then you'd be wrong. So very, depressingly wrong. The other players from #2 to #10 have spent between $1400 to $700 respectively.\n\nNow I don't care if you find this game fun, so much fun you want to spend money on it. Capitalist Clicker taught me that people will spend money to receive literally nothing except numbers on a screen. Sometimes, for even less than that.\n\nSo this review is for those of you who love seeing numbers and will spend money to make the numbers go bigger. Everyone else, the review is done here. Heroes of Might and Magic online is a better game and that one is ♥♥♥♥ poor as well. Go enjoy something fun.\n\nStill with me money crowd? Let's begin.\nWhen you spend the real money for the fake money this game knows how to treat your wallet right. It has the VIP system that gives you more bonuses the more money you spend. It also has cashback, so you get back more money the more you spend. It has events every 2weeks that you can spend money on. The game shows who the biggest spender is, so you can compete to see who has spent the most! Combat is a let down, there is no PvP for you to throw your wallet at other players with because the AI handles it all. I miss the days of being able to call non-cash spending plebs "casual". The cash shop incentives are really quite good as well as they make sure that you won't be bothered by the poor♥♥♥♥ because they provide daily bonuses to thank you for your patronage.\n\nI think thats about it, really. Sorry its such a mess but think of it as a massive list of numbers and you'll suddenly get a throbbing erection.\n\nI recommend this game for people with money.\nPoor people need not apply. Ever, actually.\nSupport my Kickstarter "Give me money simulator 2016"\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","August 31, 2015","true","190.2"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","54","19","35","21","1"

However it is a fun game that is what it is.\nppl sell copyrights all the time , not a big deal really. it has the look and feel of HOMM5 but the playstyle is a bit differnt\nYou have to know the genre to like it and if you don't then do some research on it before you make up your mind . For that some one made a LP for others to watch and see what the game has to offer and i will repost it here also.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/sziEk8IM5ws","August 14, 2015","true","55.3"," 3 of 31 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","3","31","0","0"

If you're unsure about this game watching the video will surely help you decide! I as for one, love it so far and will continue to keep playing!\n\nPro's:\n* Long gameplay to keep you hooked\n* Real Time reward system that gives you materials, items, equipment, gold for time playing ex. 10 minutes of gameplay = 10K gold ect.\n*Daily events and Missions\n*Different dungeons and bosses\n*Alot of activites to keep you busy\n*Castle upgrades, you can upgrade your defences, i'm only around level 11 at the moment, unsure if that would be from other players that attack you or NPC's\n*Multiple types of creatures/enemies\n*Treasure hunting\n*Army upgrades that allow you to have different types of troops/creatures in your squad.\n*Visual upgrades based on level, i.e higher wall from level 1 - 2, guard towers, blacksmith, mage tower ect. cosmetic castle/land changes as you upgrade that provide bonuses.\n*Every dungeon contains loot\n*Treasure map dungeons contain armor/items to help your army\n*Enemies are not too overpowered\n*You may have an option at times if you are more powerful than an enemy you have a choice to too engage combat, due to fleeing foe.\n\n\nCon's:\n*Repetitive at times\n*No Free roam\n*Turn style combat, if you're not into that type of thing this game may not be for you\n*Takes time for certain upgrades and elements\n*Once your troops die, you cannot fight with your main character, the combat ends, you can choose to rematch if you wish.\n\n\n\nWhat's up ladies and gentlemen! if you would like to see a reveiw based on current features and gameplay about Shadow Of Kingdoms you can find it here!: https://youtu.be/sziEk8IM5ws","August 12, 2015","true","461.5"," 22 of 279 people (8%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","8","22","279","17","22"

After a certain point, the receipt of lesser items, due to being a free player, and the limits on what magic you can study (random from any school, unless you are a paid player, and also buying gems to spend), leave you unable to stop people who do pay, from pretty much stomping you in PVP.","May 4","false","23.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
