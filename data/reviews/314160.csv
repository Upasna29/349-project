So when Steam released a new version I was excited.  I bought it on day one of it's release.\n\nHowever, free flight mode wouldn't work.  But after emailing DoveTail Games tech support they deteremined that I had a corrupt download.  I did a re-download and install and it worked perfectly.  The problems were not with the game.\n\nI'm very pleased that the graphics are better than ever.  There is over 24,000 airports around the world all with exact runway layouts, taxiways, buildings and scenery around the airports.  Plus every major city, tourist attraction, landmark, river, lake, stream around the world has been simulated. Navigation aides operate just like in real life.  Flight Simulator was a huge undertaking and it's all at your fingers for just a few bucks.  Amazing.\n\nIf you plan to get your pilot's license or need a tool to stay sharp (without spending $100+ per hour to rent a plane), then Flight Simulator X is a must have.  It's just a no-brainer.  Even if you own other flight simulators, you won't find any with all these features.\n\nMicrosoft along with other companies spent many years and millions and millions of dollars developing this product.  When it was developed it was actually built to take advantage of faster computers that would be available in the future.  That's why as time goes by, the game actually gets better.\n\nWhile I use it as a flight instruction tool, my son uses it like a game.  He enjoys the missions and together we go on sight-seeing tours.  We've  Flown over the pyramids and over the Nile river.  We've tooled over Washing DC and viewed the Lincoln Memorial, The Washington Monument and the Whitehouse.  You name it we've been there, Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, Space Needle, etc.\n\nYour kids will learn more about world gerography from this game than from any book.  Because it's not just pictures, it's real life simulation.  They have to take off froma local airport and actually find landmarks.\n\nAfter I bought my Steam version of Flight Simulator, I was going to install my boxed "Accelleration Expansion Pack".  But to my surprise, I found that it already came pre-installed with this Steam set.\n\nAND THE BEST PART... I once paid over $600.00 for a packaged video course on getting a private pilot's license.  But FSX comes with built in flying lessons by legendary Certified Flight Instructor Rod Machado.  He will teach you how to get not only your private pilot's license, then your instrument rating, then your commercial license, and then how to become an Airline Transport Pilot.  That much real life training in a real life flight school would be at least $25,000.  But you get it for free with FSX.\n\nObviously nothing beats learning in a real plane, but this is a close second.  And it's all for the price of a pizza.\n\nSince my first purchase I have purchased several copies as gifts for friends and family and would recommend it as either a game or a learning tool for any future private pilots.","December 27, 2014","true","140.7"," 2,347 of 2,446 people (96%) found this review helpful 93 people found this review funny","96","347","2","93","53"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jenstrolldom/recommended/314160/","jenstrolldom","Jens "Kirurgen" Trolldom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jenstrolldom/","213 products in account","TL;DR: It's basically the same simulator that Microsoft published in October 2006. See the chapter about differences if you're not new to FSX.\n\nLong version:\nThose who don't know the series, should know that Flight simulator X is called FSX by short.\n\nI've been using flight sim software for a long time now, and actually got the FSX: Gold edition for free from Microsoft in 2006, so i have spent some hours (about 1500-2000) in this before it was released on steam.\n\nIn this review i will focus on FSX: Steam edition as a game presented for new users, and then point out the differences between the Steam edition and the regular one that was published in 2006.\n\nFlight Simulator for new users:\nTo be fair, if you only want to play FSX for casual arcadeish gameplay, crashing planes and so on DON'T BUY THIS.\nIf you have checked out FSX on youtube and found HD videos of big living Airports, shiny ultra realistic planes, and other things that look very realistic, and think that this is what the "game" is, then DON'T BUY THIS. These videos is a result of many add-ons, a beast of a machine, several short clips, and a lot of editing. They look incredible, but doesn't represent FSX for what it is.\n\nBut if you are new to flight simulators and want to learn the basics of flying, and/or want to learn how to fly by instrument rules, or knows how to fly and want to fly from/to locations you know, you should buy this!\n\nA short list of what this simulator has to offer from stock:\n\nPros:\n- It includes the whole world, with almost every airport (some big cities, but mostly blocky buildings at airpots).\n- Decent flight model (How the airplane reacts to the world)\n- Extreme rate of customization (see add-on chapter below)\n- Many settings that allow anything from basic to advanced flights\n- Decent amount of stock airplanes.\n\nCons:\n- 32-bit architecture/VAS (See Add-on chapter)\n- Poor performance (Very CPU demanding, and not forgiving for AMD users)\n- Stock planes (very basic and does not represent the real aircraft very good)\n- Add-ons (see chapter below)\n\nAdd-ons\nFlight simulator must be the sim with the most add-ons in the world. It's amazing how many developers that make things for FSX. Without the add-ons i would NOT recommend this simulator. An example of what add-ons you can buy/get is:\n\n- Airplanes: Anything from basic free planes, to really advanced and realistic airplanes like the Majestic Dash-8 Q400 or PMDG 737 NGX.\n- Scenery (Landscape/Cities/Airports): Anything from free fan-made stuff, to professionally made add-ons from companies like Orbx FTX, Aerosoft, Flight1, and so on.\n- Weather/Textures: Like with Airplanes and Scenery you can get a lot of other software to boost the quality of the weather system (new textures and possibilities to get the real world weather), ground and water textures.\n- Tools/Mission packs: You can also get a lot of mission-packs, and other tools. Both freeware and payware.\n\n\nAdd-on cons:\n\nEven tho FSX is nothing without it's add-ons, it's still many problems with them. Often to get what you really want, you need to pay a lot of money to buy all the good add-ons. And there is also the fact that the more add-ons you add to FSX the slower it loads. Some add-ons also cause problems with other add-ons installed (from minor bugs to FSX not starting at all). This happens more often with freeware add-ons than payware add-ons.\n\nAlso because of the poor performance in FSX, and the fact that it's heavy CPU demanding (I got an 4Ghz AMD 8-core processor) you might not get to a playable framerate if you have combine a detailed airport with for example the PMDG 737 NGX (6-10 FPS). If you run Intel you will get a much better performance because of the logical cores in the intel processor.\n\nAlso; Remember that this version of FSX is called FSX: Steam edition. Even though every add-on for FSX should work on FSX:SE, some might have problems if not optimized for FSX:SE\n\n32-bit architecture / VAS\n\nDisclaimer: Im no expert on how the architecture of software works, nor how VAS is built. The following are own experiences and forum research to find a solution to this problem.\n\nThe biggest achilles heel that haunt allmost every FSX user is VAS (Virtual Access Space). Im not going to go in detail on what it is and how it works, but i will tell you the basics, and it's limitations.\n\nVAS is basically virtual memory (Note: this does not equal RAM, nor harddrive space). Each program you run gets it's own chunk of VAS that it can fill up. If the VAS limit is exceeded the program will STOP WORKING with the well known "Out of Memory" (OOM) error.\n\nFSX is built on the old 32-bit architecture. This limits the programs VAS to about 4GB. This becomes a major problem when you start putting add-ons in FSX. Too many add-ons, or add-ons that is poorly optimized will push the VAS limit and cause an OOM.\n\nThe VAS will fill up over time. An example: FSX base game will take about 1,2 GB. When loaded into the world you will be at aprox 2 GB VAS. You then have a fancy add-on airport that takes about 300MB, and an add-on airplane that takes about 350MB. You then start flying with a VAS at 2,6GB. No problem you think? You take off and fly towards the destination, that is on the other side of the country. On your way you fly over 4-5 other add-on airports, and your VAS is suddenly 3,7GB. Then you reach your destination, and on final, about to land you hear a "DING", with a message telling you "Out of memory", and FSX quit.\n\nAnother problem with the VAS is that it doesn't clear it's memory when you don't need it anymore. So if you fly a short trip from airport A to airport B where you reach 3,2GB VAS usage, and then start another flight from airport C, your VAS will still be 3,2GB.\n\nFSX Users have several solutions to avoid this error, like for exampel using a program to monitor their VAS so they can save the flight and restart FSX. Another solution is to deactivate all the scenery you don't need for the flight. Also, the AI traffic fills up the VAS, so be sure to have this set to 0%. Some developers also run the core of their add-on in windows and not FSX to save VAS usage.\n\nOther than that, it is NOT possible to fix this issue, other than developing a new simulator that uses a 64-bit architecture and allow higher VAS usage.\n\nDifference between FSX and FSX:SE\nIf you are a long-time user of FSX and wonder if you should buy the steam edition, the answer is maybe.\n\nI will list the main differences i've found between FSX and FSX: Steam edition:\n\n- FSX:SE is a re-released FSX: Gold edition, so all servicepacks are included\n- FSX:SE uses Steamworx for multiplayer. FSX used gamespy (no longer supported after february 2013)\n- FSX:SE can be installed on every computer you own using steam, and no CD-key required. Every FSX disc have a maximum installation limit of 5 before the disc is useless, and you had to save the CD-key.\n- FSX:SE is still supported and receives updates. Microsoft doesn't support FSX anymore.\n- Some bugs from FSX is fixed, and FSX:SE is tweaked to run better on modern computers.\n- FSX:SE does however NOT include the SDK that's included in FSX.\n\nThere might be even more differences that i haven't noticed/forgot about when i wrote this.\n\nOverall it runs slightly better than FSX, and when i finally had to reinstall FSX i landed on using the steam edition.\n\nConclusion:\nI recommend FSX:SE because of all the add-ons from FSX, and that there are few other decent options out there. You should also check out x-plane 10 and P3D (Lockheed-martins version of FSX).\n\nI wonder if anybody actually read this. :p","February 13","true","150.0"," 265 of 268 people (99%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","99","265","268","6","14"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MikeN64/recommended/314160/","MikeN64","Mike65","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MikeN64/","31 products in account","The Microsoft Flight Simulator series is one of the most iconic PC game franchises of all time, and, to an extent, back in '06 FSX lived up to what was expected of it. Aside from the obvious performance issues and supposed cut content relating to visual fidelity (some early screens depict incredibly dense scenery and fantastic lighting effects that weren't  seen in the final game, even on the highest settings), it was a good way for the series to come to a close. The Steam Edition of FSX now exists because of an agreement between Microsoft and Dovetail Games, who made the Train Simulator games. This agreement permitted Dovetail to make a few minor tweaks to the game to allow it to function properly on newer machines (specifically Windows 8.1), manage the updated multiplayer component, and obviously distribute it on Steam. I am not fond of the Train Simulator business model, and thankfully the devs have NOT modified FSX at all in this release, as a result the legal agreement. This "Steam Edition" comes with the Deluxe Edition of the original FSX, the "Acceleration" expansion pack, all service packs, and said performance enhancements. As I stated above, you can also play multiplayer again.\n\nIf you're new to Flight Simulator, are an X-Plane enthusiast, or are just interested in aviation in general I strongly recommend picking this game up on sale, while the sale lasts. There is a TON of content included. FSX allows you to fly around the globe (no BS micro transactions for different places, a la "Microsoft Flight", the failed attempt to "casualize" the series in 2012) completely unrestricted, and comes with 24 planes/choppers, which all feature a set of liveries. The AI aircraft make the world feel more alive, and airports feature pivoting jetways and moving baggage/pushback trucks to add to the experience. If your PC will allow you to crank up the settings, you'll get the fully featured terminals, but expect your framerate to tank while on the ground.\n\nThe simulator also includes a strong and (in my opinion) somewhat underrated set of missions, which are VERY well voice acted and feel incredibly realistic. I strongly advise anyone who buys this to not only enjoy the Free Flight mode, but also to play some of the missions. They range from extremely easy hand-holding missions in Ultralights to challenging air races in stunt planes, along with everything in between. My favorite part about the missions is that whenever the writers needed a guiding voice for the player, they carefully wrote a believable character into the mission who helps you with your task, rather than having a voice from above tell you what to do in every mission (you only hear this voice in the tutorial missions) or simply having written on-screen dialogue boxes instruct you, like most other flight sims out there. There is a LOT of content here, which is what sets FSX apart from its competition.\n\nNow, while FSX is a great sim, it's still 8 years old. There are some worthy alternatives out there, probably the most famous being X-Plane, which, unlike FSX, is still being actively developed. It runs better, but the world you're playing in doesn't match the complexity and visual fidelity of that of FSX. The planes look and feel more realistic, but the game is not necessarily technically superior to FSX. From an objective standpoint FSX takes the crown when it comes to gritty realism in most cases because of how the game is programmed from a simulation standpoint. These games may look similar onscreen, but under the hood they are completely different. FSX handles almost everything physics related by computing complex mathematical equations based on data tables for each aircraft, whereas X-Plane was literally born as a wind tunnel simulator, which sets it ahead of FSX on the tech side in some respects. You can easily make your own plane in X-Plane, since the physics are handled by its wind tunnel engine, whereas in FSX you need to go in with a full knowledge of how it will perform to do the same. It took the ACES team years to perfect the physics of each aircraft, some of which would carry over from previous iterations of Flight Simulator because it took such meticulous research to get the tables perfect. That being said there is a lot of free content available online for both games. And yes, from what I can tell legacy mods function in the Steam Edition of FSX.\n\nNow for the subjective part of the review. You have been warned.\n\nWhile I was very fair in my above comparisons between FSX and X-Plane, it's worth mentioning that X-Plane isn't all it's cracked up to be with regard to actual content. You'll often see advocates online telling you to "come into the future" because FSX is outdated. If the future means paying for individual airports and aircraft models, count me out. Let's talk about X-Plane's own Steam release. The product itself, which is fully priced mind you, is essentially just the game engine with a few mediocre airplanes and Tarmac-only airports. Just abandoned parking lots (on par with respectable mobile sims like Infinite Flight...wow). I've been told that you need to pay for additional content, which in my opinion is very unjustified here. I can see this model being fair in sims like Rise of Flight, but here? Thankfully X-Plane has a rather nice free modding scene, so that may be a saving grace. Furthermore, the full install is 80 gigabytes. This is probably the result of distrust between the devs and their autogen engine, since, unlike Microsoft, their map data wasn't acquired internally (FSX uses MS's own satellite imagery, which means ACES, the Microsoft game studio behind FS, was inherently more familiar with the data and how they could use it to apply automatically generated scenery). It's a shame the Flight Simulator series isn't still around to offer some serious competition, because X-Plane currently dominates the non-militaristic subsection of the flight sim genre, and it's got a ravenous community to defend its every business decision. The engine is good and runs well on most PCs built within the past few years, though it is a huge memory hog. FSX isn't, but its utilization of modern CPU configurations is embarrassingly poor.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're going into the simming genre hoping for a fully featured, fleshed out flight sim that's excellent for beginners and is the absolute pinnacle of its genre (the FS series is over 32 years old!) FSX is a great choice. This is the only official version of FSX still sold today, and it's very unusual to see a product like this from a company like Microsoft show its face on Steam. Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition, while considerably outdated, is a welcome addition to the wonderful collection of flight simulators available on Steam.","December 18, 2014","true","6.2"," 395 of 421 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","395","421","8","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kabacus/recommended/314160/","kabacus","Kabacus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kabacus/","596 products in account","A slightly re-vamped version of the 2006 classic.  Dovetail Games have agreed distribution rights with Microsoft for this flight-sim and released it on Steam late 2014.  Along with the distribution rights they have been permitted sufficient access to the code to allow them to adjust and optimise the sim to better suit todays PC.  That having been said, this is still a single threaded a poorly optimised 32-bit application and even the most powerful of todays PC's struggle to attain "high" frame rates, especially when you start to include a few add-ons.\n\nThat brings me nicely on to the add-ons.  Due to the program being around since 2006 there is an unbelievable amount of DLC available for this sim, before you reach for your credit card though, make sure that the supplier specifies that it is compatible with FSX Steam Edition or the add-on is listed in the known compatible add-ons on the community page.\n\nThere are some very good add-ons that are free, there are some exceptional add-ons that cost quite a bit of money (A2A Simulations, PMDG) and there are add-ons that are free for limited functionality or can cost for full functionality (FSUIPC). The key is research, have a look at Jordan Kings Freeware Video to get an idea of what is possible for nothing more than bandwidth. Alternatively you can very quickly rack up a £100 or more spend and still think there is room for improvement (REX, Orbx).\n\nA final word about add-ons. FSX requires you to generally get your hands dirty when adding features, if you don’t know your “%appdata%” from “My Documents” make sure you have fully researched the product you intend to buy and ensure you are comfortable with the installation procedure before you cough up the dough for it. This isn’t the case for the DLC that can be purchased from Steam, though I have to admit, most of the Steam DLC doesn’t appeal (see edit at the bottom).\n\nRegardless of whether you stay with the stock program or buy enhancements, the core sim can give hours of enjoyment if you have an interest in aviation. Users range from the complete novice that has only sat in row 14F of an A320 (me), to fully licensed pilots (so it must be OK).\n\nAlthough not a requirement, a joystick is recommended as well as a bit of patience and a lot of reading. You can jump into a Cessna 172 and lark about, or you can plan a flight for the same plane and follow, as close as can be reasonably expected in a 2006 sim, required procedures and protocols.  If, for example, you buy a PMDG add-on you have to calculate the fuel for the plane based on the number of passengers and their luggage, then you have to program the flight management computer and select your route, waypoints, approach etc. It must take 20 minutes or more to get to a point where you can actually start the engines! Alternatively you can just jump into a micro-light and be flying over Friday Harbor in a trice, the choice is yours.\n\nEdit 18/12/15: DTG are introducing a number of add-ons that don't deserve my original comment. Examples are FTX Trees HD, REX Texture Direct 4, RAAS Pro, Accu-Feel and a couple of the aircraft.","October 24, 2015","true","516.8"," 286 of 298 people (96%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","96","286","298","21","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tallbadger/recommended/314160/","tallbadger","Badger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tallbadger/","369 products in account","My God has this game has been improved!\n\nSHORT VERSION: Buy this game if you love flight sims, lots of missions and a stack of real to life scenery/weather/planes etc.  It will not be money wasted.\n\nLONG VERSION: Lifelong Flight Simulator fans will remeber the day when FS 2000 was released in that big cardboard box with a heatbound Pilot's handbook over 230 pages long; beautifully presented and well worth the buy.  Then, it seemed, when FSX came along, the fad was nearly over.  Releasing FSX Acceleration confirmed this, and the devs behind the Microsoft flight sim series were put out to pasture, where all the devs from closed studios are left to run free range.  Some survived the mass slaughter of 1874, but most, sadly perished.  Apparently, some now work for Dovetail and after a long time, we now have the Steam Edition of FSX to enjoy.\n\nGuys, you've done a fantastic job!\n\nIn the original FSX, you would find that moving the camera around the plane was quite sketchy in that it would jump where it wanted most of the time, and there was noticable lag.  This is THE main problem with older games when played on newer systems - GPUs as powerful as those today were'nt dreamed of when those games were developed.  They knew not of 1920x1080 and, as such, the software has to do the best it can nowadays.  FSX-SE has addressed that by ensuring that there will never be lag again.  Running this on a GTX 770, whilst it powers 3 screens; not a single instance of lag in display.  I will say this though, as this is a game that wasn't really designed for 1920x1080, just remember the old Windows Alt+Enter trick, and you'll be fine.\n\nBack to the lag, the controls no longer display laggy instances, and as soon as you move your joystick/mouse/gamepad, the plane reacts, with such precision, you wouldn't know you were in a simulator until you see the pixelated ground you're about to crash into.  Airports were great and really well designed in FSX, but now they have had a bit of a revamp, so expect some sharper images.\n\nIn general, the game has been VASTLY improved, and, as a private pilot myself (before I lost my license due to the UK government getting scared of diabetics flying planes and insisted that every diabetic pilot or ATC personell be summarily fired) I love being able to get back behind a flight stick and rudder.  This game is also great for the casual plane nut, as there are so many missions to choose from, all ranging from the VERY basics (which will get you up in the air and give you an understanding of how a plane actually works) to the INSANELY hard (engines on fire, having to fly 60+nm in a snow storm without engines in a 747-700).  You can change realism settings, set failures and faults to happen at a specific time, location or randomly.  You can download real world weather (updated every 15 minutes) from WHEREVER you are in the world.\n\nI would say this, however, if you really are a proper "casual" flight nut, I'd recommend Microsoft Flight instead.\n\nA vast array of other great missions, planes, scenery etc are included in the game, however there is a plethora of other mods available and there have been since FS 98 way back when.\n\nSo come one come all and enjoy this amazing revamp of a modern classic.","January 6, 2015","true","57.9"," 216 of 237 people (91%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","91","216","237","21","3"

In FSX: SE you get in to the cockpit of a number of different aircraft ranging from jumbo jets to ultralight aircraft in Free Flight or in a number of missions of increasing difficult made by the original development team all over the World.\n\nFSX: SE has always been a game that I have loved due to it providing me with an opportunity to fly aircraft I'm legally unable to fly (due to a long term health condition) and when I upgraded to a Windows 8.1 PC and found I could no longer play this game I was bitterly disappointed. When I heard about DoveTail taking over the game from Microsoft and updating it to work with Windows 8.1 I was over the moon and for the most part I was pleased with what I got when purchasing it through Steam.\n\nI'd also just like to say that despite only having 9 hours in the game on Steam I have at least 50-60 hours logged on the boxed edition.\n\n+Over 24,000 locations to visit which are all realistic based on the locations in 2006\n+24 Aircraft, including fixed-wing and rotary craft, each with a number of different variations\n+You can customise how realistic the game is ranging from a relatively easy game to a very realistic flight sim\n+DoveTail did a fantastic job at increasing performance and making it work on new operating systems\n+It's very easy to get in to thanks to its fantastic tutorials and increasing difficulty\n+A wide variety of missions ranging from simple cargo delivery missions to emergency landings after complete engine failure\n+Multiplayer works again, I've never played it myself but I know a lot of fans of the series were very happy to see this\n+A huge modding community (most mods are considered third party addons and do cost money)\n+FSX: SE includes the Acceleration addon pack which was developed before DoveTail took over\n+A huge number of hotkeys for the vast number of different controls in this game\n+Very good settings menus which make it incredibly easy to customise your FSX: SE experience\n\n-The graphics, scenery, flight models etc. still look just as bad as they did when the game first released 7 years ago, this could have something to do with DoveTail's deal with Microsoft but it's still very disappointing\n-The DLC that's being pumped out by DoveTail is both overpriced and according to other reviewers not particularly high quality which is bitterly disappointing as I wanted high quality first party addons\n-Despite being called 'Steam Edition' it has zero Steam integration, that means no cards, achievements, workshop or Cloud support\n-The SDK and modding tools have been patched out of the game, my guess is DoveTail don't like the fact that no one is buying their addon packs in favour of the vast number of far better quality addons available elsewhere\n\nWorth a mention:\n-I play this with a combination of a flight stick (with hotkeys) and keyboard for less important operations and I can't imagine it playing particularly well with M&KB or Controller only\n\nVerdict:\n8\n\nDespite some flaws the Steam Edition of this game allows me to play a much loved game that I would not otherwise be able to play. Overall a fantastic flight simulator which gives easy access for people new to this kind of game while also providing a great experience for regular fliers or fans of Flight Sims.\n\nEl K.","March 27, 2015","true","21.8"," 151 of 176 people (86%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","86","151","176","13","17"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/donkeronderwater/recommended/314160/","donkeronderwater","donkeronderwater","http://steamcommunity.com/id/donkeronderwater/","585 products in account","Getting started with flying This simulator offers a complete package for newcomers to the genre.\n\nEven without add-ons it's a nice looking game with a massive amount of content. Lots of different aircrafts and the whole world to explorer.\nWith free and bought add-ons and special hardware it can be expanded and customised to your preferences. (There are amazing high quality simulation planes available.) Making it into a popular flight simulator with serious enthusiasts.\nBut if you are getting started or are just a casual player you won't need that to enjoy this simulator. And important, it offers a good selection of tools to get started and learn how to fly.\n\n\nMissions (tutorials) To get in the air quickly there are tutorial missions showing you some of the basics.\nThe missions offer somewhere to start within all the possibilities of this simulator and are a quick way to try out all the different types of planes with a little guidance in operating them.\nThese missions touch on most of the available airplanes and different styles of flying. From basic take-off, taxiing and landing patterns, to flying sailplanes, helicopters, commercial traffic, air-racing and flying from aircraft carriers. The first tutorial missions will be easy for beginners but the more advanced missions keep offering you a challenge as you improve your flying abilities.\nNice about the first tutorial missions is that they tell you where to look at in the environment based on real world aviation skills. The briefing screen for the missions also tells you which articles to read for more detailed information about the current mission.\n\nLearning Centre – Library These articles can be found in the Learning Centre, a big library with documentation about everything concerned with flying and the planes. All edited to giving you real world information and the link with the implementation within the simulator.\n\nLearning Centre – Lessons Then there are the flying lessons. For me the best part to get into flying.\nThere are study materials available for the school and guided lessons, by an actual flight instructor! It's almost like a real flying lesson, where the instructor gives you part of the controls and you can keep practicing to get the hang of flying and, important, landing an airplane. Well, you don't need to read everything. You can pick most up listening to the instructor. But it's there and I think it’s good and useful in-depth information.\n\nControls This game offers support for almost any type of controller. And you can add many devices simultaneously for separate tasks. I've seen people using a racing wheel. And there are fully functional cockpits being build and connected to this game.\nBut to get started you won't need much.\n\nKeyboard: Not immediately intuitive, but after a short learning time it’s doable. I used to fly (FS2002) with the keyboard, it (still) works fine for normal flight, just be careful with fast/aggressive planes. And unless you build yourself a complete cockpit you'll use it for the special commands. Although many can be applied using the mouse in the in-game cockpit.\nTIP: don't just press the keys, TAP them and be patient about it. A plane doesn't react immediately and pressing a key to much/long will make it move fast and hard to control.\nMouse: I haven't done it yet, but you can use the mouse to steer the plane.\nController: Now I tried using a Logitech F710 (it pretends to be a Xbox 360 controller). And it works surprisingly well. It is already preconfigured and the default settings offer the basics to start flying. For basic flying I'd say it might be even easier to use than a joystick, especially for helicopters.\nJoystick: I only have experience with a basic joystick with twist for rudder and an analogue throttle. It's a little more realistic and the throttle is great.\nJust as with the add-ons: If you want to and have the budget you can make it as advanced as you like. But it isn't necessary at all.\nMouse: Besides using the mouse to manipulate the controls in the (virtual) cockpit you can also use it to fly. (Toggle with Ctrl+Y) You'll just control the stick, but it's quite easy to use. This gives you good control, even with a laptops touchpad. Just keep track of the position of the small cross on your screen and remember the planes movements are indirect and most planes are a bit slow to respond.\nBtw. Instructions on using the different controls and most anything else can be found in the Learning Centre.\n\n\nDLC My personal note on the currently available dlc on Steam.\nThese seem consistent with the base quality of the FSX. But you can find higher quality planes and scenery for free and you can create great flight plans in Free Flight.\nI think they are a bit expensive and you'll probably won't need the extra content they offer.\nI'd say: only buy them if you want to support the publisher for the work they do in maintaining this game.\nAnd who knows what great DLC they'll add in the future.\n\n\nClosing statements And then there are so many aspects of the game that I haven't touched yet. If you get into it you can go as far ... well really far with added content, multiplayer etc. There is just so much more available.\nBut, my main point, you don't need that to have lots of fun playing and learning with this simulator.","December 25, 2014","true","30.2"," 90 of 103 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","90","103","2","0"

Anyone know what's that? S-I-M-U-L-A-T-O-R! Of course it will be hard to learn. The real pilots spend around 1 year of learning in the simulators, before their first real flight. And yeah, don't worry, this is not a fully real simulator.\n\nLet's talk about Boeing 747-400. It has the most basics controls you need, like flaps and throttle, aircraft lights and anti-ice system and many more. I just want to say it's not that so hard like in a real aircraft, where you need an hour of preparation before flight, don't worry. It takes 10 minutes for me to set everything for takeoff. And if you wonder how many hours it takes for me, before landing in extreme conditions for first time - 24 hours. It's hard, trust me, but not impossible.\n\nAnother thing: It's not impossible to play without a joystick. As I said you need time for practise. I play with a keyboard and I have 140 hours, as you can see.\n\nIt's not that so hard, you need time! Some people who are buying this game are like: "Oh yeah, I bought a flight simulator. It will be easy to fly."; And then in the game: "OMG, this is so stupid game, I can't even takeoff." Then uninstalls and write a negative review.\nI don't know why they are buying a simulator and want things to happen fast and easy. As the beginning of the review - this is a SIMULATOR! There are so many games, where to get flying you need to push only one button, like GTA, you know.\n\nUPDATE 28.09.2015: If DTG won't stop with these DLCs, the game itself will turn into the next DLC Simulator 2015 after the disappointment with TS 2016, but I still recommend it.\n\nUPDATE 04.02.2016: Yep..... DTG didn't stop and there it is... over 1400 euros for DLCs.....\n\nIMPORTANT!!!: DTG IF YOU ARE READING THIS THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU DID TO THIS GAME, BUT THESE DLCs ARE COMPLETE MADNESS! WTF!

I've been using MS Flight Sims since the first version I can remember.  When Microsoft dropped support, I did switched to Lockheed's Prepar3D, which uses a upgraded FSX engine with DX11, but I'd much rather support FSX under Steam!\nFSX really needs Steam Workshop for all its many add-ons as DLCs, which always have been a real pain to locate, purchase, and install. Steam would so much improve things for the Flight Sim World!\n\nFortunately, all the addons I have are compatible with both Prepar3D and FSX, and they all seem to work fine with this Steam version. I may have to run one of the Registration Fix tools like TweakFS, to use a few aircraft again in Prepar3D, but I haven't had any problems so far and I am used to fixing my simulator installations and getting addons working.\n\nI recommend the REX Real Environment Xtreme, Orbx Airports & Terrains, Just Flight's Air Hauler and REX Latitude add-ons, which greatly enhances the visuals and gives you something fun to do hauling cargo around the world, managing the Cargo Company and its aircraft. Someone please make these as DLCs ASAP! Orbx also has a few free demos of a great starting airports and terrain regions to fly in.\n\nI look forward to updates of FSX to DX11 for Better Graphics, More Missions for More Things To Do, More Flight & Instrument Training, Ground & Tower Operations, Steam Achievements, Trading Cards and other improvements!\n\n**NOTE:  If you are having problems with add-ons, it is most likely an registry issue and/or configuration files located in user windows profile directories.  If you check my screenshots, I have multiple addons working concurrently: REX, Orbx and Traffic X including a premium aircraft with everything maxed.  Everything should run perfect in the Steam version, it does take a lot of effort sometimes to get your simulation environment right.  There are guides in the Prepar3D community that address many problems I see people having with the Steam version.\n\nRemember:  FSX is NOT really a game, it is a professional simulator used by real world pilots to train.

Flight Sim 2000 was the high point in the series. As for X, well... it's pretty good, but back in '06 it was very taxing on even the best systems of the time. I bought a bunch of aircraft from Carenado, PMDG etc and some of the aircraft are so detailed (the Precision Manual 747 was the worst back then) that a state-of-the-art PC (back then) ran at 40 FPS on a good day.\n\nMany years have passed and most of us, pilots and simmers alike, have moved on to the competitor (X-plane). The transition wasn't too hard for me as I had some experience with X-plane during IFR sim training in a certified Seneca simulator with instructor, instruments, flight deck etc. Personally, I prefered MS Flight Simulator to X-plane for personal use. Flight Sim is very straight forward, has a large community and feels good in a home computer.\n\nAlas, a third party developer bought the rights and gave us a 'renewed' Flight Simulator X. I was thrilled. It's been a long time since I've had a flight stick or quadrant at home, but I was too excited to wait for a proper set-up and made the purchase anyway. It's been nine years, my computer is fantastic (running the latest games effortlessly), thus I expected to experience Flight Sim X in a whole new way.\n\nBoy, what a huge disappointment...\n\nThey took the boxed version of Flight Simulator X, recompiled the nine years old code for modern systems, and released it to the public. The bugs are all there, and new ones have been introduced as a consequence of running a nine years old game in modern systems. The support is the worst. Dovetail Games will refer you to Microsoft for support, even tho they're the ones putting up the game for sale. I'm not even sure they're allowed to make changes to the code itself. Your third-party airplanes? Not sure, as I haven't tried to install anything yet simply because I can't get Flight Sim to work for more than 20-30 minutes at a time. It crashes to the desktop CONSTANTLY. Again, zero support. I've tried the forums, but all I got was a bunch of good-natured fans trying to help me out. You'll find unofficial solutions here and there on the internet, but nothing worked for me. Eventually, I was told by some angry fan that it was my system's fault. I can only laugh at the suggestion, seeing as this is a perfectly well cared for computer, running games such as Arma III (a VERY taxing game indeed) under Ultra at a steady 100+ FPS, zero glitches. Same goes for every other game in my library.\n\nFlight Simulator X is broken, and hopelessly so, given the nature of Dovetail's business pact with Microsoft. Avoid the frustration. So far, it's been nothing but a huge let down for me.\n\nFor the first time in a very long time, I am forced to write: I DO NOT recommend this game.","January 19, 2015","false","7.5"," 136 of 184 people (74%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","74","136","184","7","12"

Back when I was training for my Instrument Rating, MS Flight Sim became more than just a game. It was an essential tool in the flight bag that helped solidify essential skills needed to fly in the IFR world. The end result of which saved me time and money obtaining my rating. I basically taught myself IFR flying. It was essential to understanding VOR radials and ADF tracking and intercepts.\n\nAfter flying for a career for the past 8 years I'd never thought I'd have use for MS Flight Sim ever again. However, recently I dusted off my old copy of MS Flight Sim to help prepare for my Boeing 737 type rating. A company designed a fairly accurate version of the 737 with the correct system logic. It even included a fairly accurate FMC. Once again MS Flight Sim proved useful and was essential to understanding the systems of the 737 and cockpit flows. Hopefully the Steam version will allow for these add-ons.\n\nMy advice to anyone using MS Flight Sim as a training tool would be to treat it as just a game until you start instrument training and be prepared for many misunderstandings. My previous four year’s experience as flight instructor and chief flight instructor has taught me that those used Flight Simulators during their Ab Intio training developed bad habits that needed to be trained out of them. Once you have completed your Ab Intio training, it can be an excellent training tool.\n","December 22, 2014","true","4.4"," 61 of 75 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","61","75","0","1"

Needless to say, in the months since nothing has changed.  Starting out with the game, don’t let the title fool you because this new "edition" is the same Flight Simulator X that’s been around for over 10 years.  There is nothing additional added.  There are no additional default aircraft, the scenery isn't better, it' only some minor workarounds that have been done.  Let me explain that further…\n\nWhile Microsoft is still the developer of FSX, Dovetail Games has taken over as a “publisher” for this title.  Now, it might sound a little unclear but here’s the facts surrounding Dovetail’s involvement.  They’ve done some work on the multiplayer aspects of the game, making it once again “functional”.  Not that you couldn’t play multiplayer before Dovetail got involved.  You just needed a 3rd party program and a little instruction from a Google search to get connected with your friends.  Now, due to Dovetail's involvement, that method of multiplayer has been blocked so they can provide a centeral hub for all games.  They also made the game “Steam Compatible”, which is another way of saying they modified the game so DLC could be directly installed by Steam.  That said…\n\nWhen you discuss the core of the game, nothing has changed.  The scenery is still the same.  The default aircrafts are still the same.  The interface is still the same.  It’s all the same as it was 10 years ago.  Nothing has changed or been added to this new "edition".  There have been no noticeable improvements, quite the contrary.  New bugs have crept up that cause the game to occasionally crash.  This coming from someone who has had the original FSX since it originally launched.  So why would Dovetail resurrect a game that is 10 years old when Microsoft itself doesn’t see fit to keep on the store shelves?\n\nTo answer that question you only have to browse other simulation titles by Dovetail.  The company is the kings of DLC content.  Look at their Train Simulator 2016 game.  There is very little content included with the actual game yet the cost of all the DLC for it, 232 items, comes in at close to 3 THOUSAND DOLLARS!  The DLC for Flight Simulator X is a little more tame, only around $650 for all of it, but that's still fairly ridiculous considering nothing has been added to the new "edition".  THIS is the main focus of Dovetail bringing FSX to Steam.  It’s not to make improvements to the game.  It’s not to fix the glaring bugs they've added and fix the outdated graphics.  It’s to sell DLC so they can make a quick buck off an old (and relatively dead) title.\n\nIf you already own Flight Simulator X… DO NOT BUY!\nIf you’re on the fence… DO NOT BUY!\nIf you expect new scenery… DO NOT BUY!\nif you expect more aircraft… DO NOT BUY!\n\nThere is ONLY ONE reason you should ever consider buying this Steam version.  It’s the same reason I bought it.  Because I already have a large library of free FSX content that I’ve gathered over the past years, my DVD’s were damaged somehow, and this is the only way I can now reinstall FSX.  Don’t let my play-time fool you.  If I could have avoided buying this buggy Steam version and stuck with my original FSX, I would have.","December 27, 2015","false","11.7"," 194 of 293 people (66%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","66","194","293","23","9"

I'm using FSX since 2006, and honestly, it was a nightmare back than since there simply was no hardware you could buy for money which was able to run it in a way that it was playable. This lasted for approximately 3 years. During that time Microsoft released 2 service packs and Intel released the first generation  of i7 processors which finally allowed the game/software to become really playable.\n\nI'm always juggling between the terms game and simulation software. This is because to some users FSX is a game and to other users it is a flight simulation platform. What is the difference? Well, if you see it like a game, then FSX does offer you great missions which will provide you a great deal of fun during a few weeks. If you see it as a flight simulation software, then it will become more complicated. The reason is because you can start training for a real pilot licence with this software. But this will only be interesting if you try to do it right as closely as possible as real pilots do. The problem with this is that then it is no more about flying around, which by the way will become boring very fast. But then, you will have to learn the real rules of the sky and the aviators. The learning curve will be much steeper but so much more rewarding. There are some really good books on the market which are based on Microsoft flight simulator training which will guide you through the process. I am myself a real world private pilot and I started with Microsoft Flight Simulator back in 2006 and then started working on my real pilot licence in 2009. It did help me a lot, but I also caught some flaws by simming. The problem is that in the sim you mostly have only one screen and thus you tend to focus more on your instrument panel. In real world VFR flying you have to focus more on the outside of the plane in order to navigate. I was so proficient when I started flight training that my instructor asked me if I already had some flight lessons in the past. But he also caught me too often staring at my instruments, because I got used to it while doing flight simulation. You will for sure not be able to fly a real plane only with flightsim training, but it will help you a great deal to get proficient in procedures and radio navigation and lots of other things.\n\nBut Flight Simulator X really starts to shine when you start to add quality add-ons. They bring FSX to a whole new level. You can add new weather engines, highly detailed aircrafts which do cost more than FSX itself but which allow you to operate them by the real airplane books. This is the case for general aviation airplanes as for airliners. But there is also a bunch of software add-ons which enhance the whole world of FSX. More detailed elevation meshes which cover countries, continents of even the whole world! The same is true for airports, roads, amd rivers which are much more detailed. You can buy add-on airports which look exactly like the real thing. Actually most of the large airports have been recreated in detail by add-on companies.\n\nNow you could ask yourself, but what do I get then in the Steam Edition, which is in my opinion nothing else than a MS FSX Gold Edition with a few optimizations and bug fixes. You do get a game/simulation software which tries to approximately simulate the whole planet earth, get a nice fleet of airplanes to start with. Yes, you will be able to fly in every country on earth. But only something like 40 or 50 cities and large airports have been recreated in more detail, which is already very pleasant. The other cities and airports in the world do also exist (well, most of them) but they are recreated in a more schematic way with landclasses and autogen, but lets don't get too technical.\n\nToday's hardware enables you to run FSX in a pleasant way. Since the two service packs which Microsoft did release plus the few optimizations Dovetail did, it should normally run in a stable way. I like Microsoft Flight Simulator X very much and this is why I have already plunged thousands of dollars (yes, you do read correctly) in add-ons and hardware in order to be able to fly as real as it can get in order to stay sharp for my real world flights. I have also bought some great hardware from Saitek and VRinsight which enable me to fly with a yoke, pedals and throttle levers, radio navigation stack. We nearly as I do in the real plane. So beware, if you become addicted, then it can become an expensive hobby :-)\n\nI like the fact that Dovetail now ported FSX on the Steam platform because the flight simulation community is lacking new adopters for years now, thus eroding the user base. The average age of a simmer tends to be in the mid forties and we could really use youngsters which come along to enhance the base of users. So if you dream of becoming a real world pilot or only want to have some fun, try it, I did at least never regret it.","December 18, 2014","true","20.4"," 47 of 58 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","47","58","0","0"

Yes.\n\nI have owned FS9 and FSX:Gold and have flown hundreds of hours with my dad, and I have to say... They really fixed it! This simulator used to run terrible even on my current i5-3570k OC + GTX 970 build, even on Medium-High settings with no anti-aliasing. They really have fixed it as now I can get a solid 60+ FPS (on a 144hz monitor >.>) on Ultra with Dense Autogen scenery and Anti-aliasing.\n\nWell aside from the geek part of it, it is still really fun to play. It takes I'd say, 2 hours of training before you can pretty much fly the stock planes like a pro (given that you continue flying at least once every 2 days), which really isn't that much time at all.\n\nStill is a great game to play, really happy that most of the add-ons still work, and wow, multiplayer.

Well, the game itself is still pretty awesome even though its now nine years old.  I was never able to afford the VFR scenery add ons  when I played the game   originally.  I always wanted to buy the ones covering the UK to get  the better ground imagery, but   they used to cost around £100  for the UK set, so was really pleased to see  them released on Steam  today, and at what seemed a really good deal compared to their original price.  If you buy the pack, you basically get one of the   scenery packs free.\n\nUnfortunately  I'm very disappointed.  I always though we got   satellite quality  imagery with these VFR scenery add-ons, but what I saw from my local airport (Woodford Aerodrome UK)  - my house is  directly in the flight path of the  runway.  Until last year before the   runway was closed we used to have our trees trimmed at the bottom of our garden  by the airport authority because they were  tall enought to cause problems with landing aircraft.  I know the surrounding country side like the back of my hand, but couldn't make out any land marks in game, nor from the nearby Manchester Airport.  Everything looks the same, with   cloned  houses and trees dotted liberally everywhere and the  grassland areas looking like desert.  I have all the graphic settings maxed out, but   apart from the  aircraft cockpits, everything else looks really dated.  Okay, it's nine years old, but  I  really thought the scenery would be better.  I don't think the  game is  worth £19.99,  and I think the total cost of  dlc so far (with some of it  on sale at between 25 to 50%) standing at over £100 for a nine year old game is    really way too much.  I wish Steam would support Microsoft Flight instead, which had amazing scenery, sadly  that doesn't work   any longer due to the GFWL connection.\n\nPersonally I've got mixed feelings about  recommending this game.  If you love flight sims it's still a big thumbs up, but I'd definitely wait  till all of the dlc is 50% off or more.  If flight sims are not  your thing, I'd  leave this game alone, it'll  just  confound you.\n\nI wish I could  give a thumbs up or down seperately for the  main game  and the dlc.  The game would still get a thumbs up, but the add-ons wouldn't.  There's a lot of free  custom stuff for this game, but I don't know yet whether it'll work   with Steam?\n\nEven though i've said  I think the game is now over priced, i'm still going to give it  a thumbs up, but with reservations.  I'll update when I find out if the free stuff  will work with the Steam version.","February 24, 2015","true","7.6"," 44 of 55 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","44","55","4","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vetron/recommended/314160/","vetron","Vetron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vetron/","732 products in account","Still the better civil aviation simulator due to its extensive support with a vast selection of 3rd party addons. This means that although the base package is very dated, it can be easily improved with better scenery and aircraft for a more up-to-date and fun flying experience.\n\nPerformance and PlayabilityThe base game works fine out of the box with Windows 10 and because it’s from 2006 it should run on the average computer without difficulty. However I found DX10 to be mostly broken on various graphics cards, its hit or miss whether it will work for you – if it doesn’t, DX9 mode will play fine. This is simply because the DX10 that came with the game was only a preview build rather than a full DX10 support.\n\nAnother thing to note is that when you start installing lots of addons, the game does suffer from performance issues relating to the fact it’s a 32-bit. While there are no-shortage of community config file edit suggestions, the only thing that will really help is a really high end computer here (notably cpu etc.). To avoid issues, simply be wary about what you install as some scenery addons can be terribly un-optimized.\n\nNOTE: This Steam Edition is essentially the 'Gold Edition' of the game, which contains the base FSX and the Acceleration Add-on in one install. It also uses Steam multiplayer instead of Game-spy. I have however found this version does not contain all the SDK files which were found in the Deluxe edition of the game, but most of this can sourced with a few google searches. None of this really matters unless you are going to be developing content for the game or trying to install a really outdated add-on that doesn't work around the newer service packs.\n\nAircraftThe game comes with more than a dozen aircraft, ranging from airliners like the Boeing 737, bush planes like the Piper J-3 Cub, General aviation planes like the Cessna 172 Skyhawk, classic warbirds like the P-51D Mustang, and even some helicopters thrown in the mix such as the Robinson R-22 Beta II. All these come with detailed cockpits and various paint scheme options.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=679814115\nWhile this is indeed a reasonable selection of planes included for new pilots to the game, it has to be said that experience does improve considerably when getting 3rd party aircraft as these are not only better looking, but can feature more accurate flight models.\n\nMultiplayerMultiplayer works out of the box via Steam, is pretty easy to join and works well. However the game does not come with a dedicated server, but there are 3rd party hosting applications (Such as FSHost[www.chocolatesoftware.com]) that will fill this gap.\n\nExploring during a group flight with friends is something I really enjoy, and one of the things that keeps me playing FSX.\n\nFree FlightIn Free Flight you can choose to spawn at nearly any airport in the world with the aircraft, time, and weather conditions of your choice. From here you can file a flight-plan or just fly wherever you want.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=679813932\nWhile the scenery included by default is global, it is strongly recommended you do replace it with either payware such as Orbx FTX[www.fullterrain.com] or freeware such as FreeMeshX[ninetwopro.com] as it is very lacking and not very accurate by default. With modifications it can become really nice to look at and will improve your enjoyment of the game.\n\nMissionsThere are dozens of included missions with the game, ranging from tutorials, to racing, to landing on an aircraft carrier! There is quite a varied selection here, with skill levels ranging from beginner to expert, and mission lengths of around 15 minutes, up to a few hours.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=679813639\nNo career mode is included, just individual missions, but plenty to keep you busy here.\n\nConclusionSo if interested in civil aviation or aviation in general then FSX is well worth the purchase, but do so under the knowledge that your experience will improve considerably when done so with 3rd party addons, even if freeware.\n\nGood\nVaried selection of included aircraft (good, however not as good as payware)\nSteam multiplayer\nVast selection of payware and freeware mods\nGlobal Scenery\nLots of available missions\n\nNot so good\nIncluded aircraft flight models lacking (can buy payware aircraft that fly more realistic)\nDefault scenery outdated (can be improved with freeware and payware)\nNo included dedicated server\nPossible performance issues due to 32-Bit","April 18","true","177.9"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","18","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PSPbr/recommended/314160/","PSPbr","PSP","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PSPbr/","487 products in account","If flying in any way interests you, this is a great game that offers A LOT of content for it's price, and it's not that hard to get up and flying. Though you do need having a joystick, the game doesn't works that well for keyboard/mouse flying.\n\nAs for the "pure realistic simulator" thing, it could be true, but you can turn most realism off and not have to bother with most physics things, thus making flying very easy.\n\nThe graphics were the best in 2005 but they do look a bit aged now, specially the ground textures when you're not flying very high, also there's no dynamic shadows and that modern stuff. A lot is left for your imagination, really. Also, even though you can fly anywhere in the world, there are no cities in great detail, you can go looking their signature buildings though, like the Eiffel Tower and the Liberty Statue, etc. It can be fun searching for them. You can learn a lot of geography if you want too.\n\nI'd say it is MORE THAN worth for the money, but it will require some learning on your side if you never played flying games before. There's a huge set of scripted missions that can be pretty fun and challenging: like flying through Hawaii in a small plane with a tourism guide showing you everything to patrolling the skyes in around a rocket launch with a military jet.  Also there are awesome tutorials that will get you started into the game. Almost every mission will have a voiced co-pilot pointing you out stuff, and that makes the missions feel very real and awesome.\n\nAnd if you want to get deeper into the game, there are thousands of mods that cover pretty much everything: graphical mods, physics mods, realism mods, whole countries and planes built in awesome detail, new missions, you name it. It can get as complex and complete as you want as long as you got the money to get the more cool addons. Looking at it that way, FSX is more of a basic engine you can build up to the highest possible standards. And that probably explains why there was no sequel built by Microsoft: FSX covers everything already. There are on youtube lot's and lot's of videos that show what some mods are capable, just try not to be discouraged into getting the game because of that though, it's is great in vanilla state anyway.","January 1, 2015","true","31.9"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","30","40","0","3"

This is supported by the fact that a 8 year old game has received "Mostly Positive" reviews so far with many people claiming to have aviation background praising it for being their all time favorite flight simulator. Don't be mislead however by this current status - it is more of a legacy feedback and does not fully represent what the Steam Edition actually is.\n\nI will skip all the positive aspects in my review. They have already been pointed out extensively by others and I do agree with many of them. I will briefly give you my reasons for voting it DOWN which for me outweigh easily all the positives.\n\nFSX:SE has has been licensed to the worst developer [acting as publisher for the current edition] who is in charge of creating the next installment under the brand name Flight Simulator. Why worst? Well – Dovetail has no interest in the community other than milking it continuously with DLC releases. SDK has already been cut out from FSX:SE which means that the community will not be allowed anywhere near to creating and sharing. It is clear that the current, as well as the future FS, will follow the same path of Train Simulator by allowing only licensed companies to develop and sell DLC. Dovetail has once again waived the finger at the enormous creativity that the community has – it is strictly business, m8s!\n\nAt first I was very excited for the game coming to Steam. Even more so at the possibility of getting a new flight simulator in 2015. However after a short research it became apparent that I am not the target group of Dovetail. Have a look at the trailer of Train Simulator 2015 – the guy being brainwashed to buy it is a middle aged cash cow, looking to waste time and has money for 4000$ worth of DLC crap. Yes - **** *** to the people who actually CAN create and contribute to the development of the game. They do not bring money and without money Mr. Cameron would not come again to our offices to praise us for creating worthless jobs.\n\nThe potential of this simulator is to be the definitive open world exploration game. If it were to have the right developer the community would jump right in and fit a detailed copy of Earth together with the whole aviation industry inside.\n\nThumbs down for the lost potential – this game will develop to be yet another epic failure.\n\nPS: Dovetail, don't give me your copy paste developer response – your propaganda tactics belong strictly to the PR department archives.\n\nValve, please nurf their damage control options – it is shocking to see them spamming negative reviews.","March 31, 2015","false","11.6"," 31 of 44 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","31","44","5","9"

However after that is all figured out, it is an amazing game to play for professionals and people who just feel like goofing around. There are fun missions for times when you dont know what to do and tutorials for newcomers You are going to eventually have to buy some payware addons to really make the game shine, but there is plenty of freeware like project opensky aircraft if you dont have the money. The game does not appear to be hard on your computer and has a really good community. The graphics are ok considering when it was made, but they could be better especially the water and there is no wingflex for the default 737 and the gear doesn't tilt in the 747 which is a realism killer. The clouds also magically fade away when you get near them and there is no volumetric effect. I would definitely recommend this. After making the move from x plane to fsx i feel that the colours look my vibrant and less gloomy, better freeware, more payware, and the wingtip vortices add a nice feel. In terms of physics, i have never flown a plane myself but the physics in airplanes feel not completely realistic but pretty good in my opinion. The touchdowns feel a bit stiff but the overall flight doesn't feel "on rails" as others say. Helicopter physics do not feel very realistic. They are too stable and easy to control. For how i like to fly though the physics suit me perfectly and i personally dont want that realism but i know others will. The atc is easy to use and great for beginners aswell. No need to go all professional and download flight plans, all you need to know is where you are leaving from and where your destination is. All in all i give this game a 7/10 by itself but if you include the vast amount of addons i give this a 9/10 Even if you think a 7/10 is a bit low my opinion is to watch and read some reviews, look at some pictures, if youve already done that then my opinion is buy the game.

The game provides a very realistic look into the large capacity of solutions Pilots must conjure on a day to day basis with difficult challenges such as different weather conditions and the size of airport you choose to find yourself in. I would highly recommend buying a controller to use while playing the game at the least as I soon found the difficulties of flying with just a keyboard which increases the difficulty rating by about 10.

So whats the difference, Not much. but no more game-spy, means no more multiplayer unless you run a VPN, but dovetail have taken care of this, by releasing it on steam. So multiplayer is back in.\n\nThis is by no means a game, it is a hard core flight simulator, With over 10,000hrs on it my self (boxed version) you will see my hours soon rise quite quickly.\n\nBut if you have the boxed version, why the steam version? i hear you ask. Good quesation. Well its simple really, as i have herd that dovetail intend on releasing new add-ons/expansions for this very version, which means only the steam version is being up-dated and worked on. meaning the boxed version os out-of date.\n\nThe steam version is still just as customizable as the boxed, and housed in your steamapps folder just as it is in your program folder. so installing extra add-ons is not an issue, as they have not touced that side, and if they did, well i woud not have bought it.\n\n\n\nThere are unfortunatly some add-ons that currently do not work with FSE:SE, those i have found to be atm\n\n- Cargo Pilot - from just flight\n- Active Sky Next\n\nBut i have herd that ALL A2A planes work 100%, now this is a good point, because if your in the business of getting add-on aircraft. then A2A is the way to go. the attention to detail, the flight physics, the realism, it is all mind blowing.\n\n\nThis is going to breath new life into an old but epic simulator. @£19,99 (when not on sale) i think that is a more than fair price, being as this is the FULL version of FSX with acceleration.\n\nWhat more could you ask for, Buy it, download it, Sim it.\n\n\nSee you in the skies.","December 19, 2014","true","114.4"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

I have been playing FS since it was first introduced in the 1980s and have become addicted. Very disappointed when Microsoft decided to pull out of FS development a few years ago. Clearly the box version was not going to keep up with the advances in operating systems over time and I was seeing the box FSX sim crash on a regular basis, even on a very highly configured box. Played with X-Plane for a while but not the same. I was sceptical about how much better the Steam Edition would be over the box version but the price reduction was a good incentive. All I can say is WOW!!! The Steam Edition is superior to the box version in many ways, not the least of which is Windows 10 compatability with not a single OS crash even though all settings are at maximum. Graphics are better and performance is much better. Very pleased I moved to FSX SE and I am now back in the cockpit.","March 26","true","23.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","0"

Still there are errors that occurs that results to CTD but not as often as before, but occurs rather randomly in different phase of the flight.\n\nOne very noticeable improvement is to the Piper J-3 Cub default aircraft, before you could hardly land it without ground looping even when there is no wind.\n\nAs a bonus if you have invested on some add-ons the odds are you could still "add-it" without a problem or at least with minimal fuss, but of course not all of your add-ons will work.\n\nWould not recommed to a casual user (non-techy), but I could still recommend this game to people who would not mind not having a constant update and who could in one way or the other resolve their own issues or thru other users.\n\n\nP.S. Still hoping that DTG will continue to improve/update or to the very least maintain compatibility to newer OSes and modern hardwares.","February 20","false","194.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

This simulator, while elderly by computer standards, is an absolute dream. It runs perfectly on my laptop. It also comes with a TON of literature about flying, so you can really get into the whys and wherefors of the simulation (hint: learn to trim so you don't have to keep a deathgrip on your stick). The playthrough tutorials are good but the flight lessons have long, entertaining essays that will really hone your skills. Sadly, the in-game scripts for the flight lessons are not included as of this writing. Still, for someone on a budget with an older machine, this is about as good as it gets.","December 24, 2014","true","29.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I have been playing Flight Simulator since the days of FS98. FSX was a true masterpiece as others have commented and I was very sad to see the franchise get axed by Microsoft. Thankfully, Dovetail has released the classic game on Steam. Through some under-the-hood tweaks, it plays better than the boxed version of FSX that Microsoft released!\n\nThe performance increase alone makes this a worthwhile purchase. It is also worth the money to not have to safeguard your old FSX discs and serial since you can always re-download on Steam.\n\nI would highly recommend and encourage people to support this effort and game.

Although my current in game hours may seem a bit low to give the game the raving review that I'm giving it,I assure you there is a reason.\n\nI have owned a copy of FSX since it was realeased all the way back on Windows XP, and as it was my favorite game, and I was in gradeschool, I played the game. A lot. How much a lot? Total flight time was over 5,000 hours flying alone. My total landings were over 10k, and my total distance was enough to circle the globe 120 times.\n\nI was very proud of my logbook (all printed about 25 pages), so when I went with my dad to work one day (he's the supervisor of ground operations at Cleveland Hopkins, he basically says if the airport is open or not **not if flights are cancelled or not**) and 12 year old me showed my printed log book to my dad's former boss.\n\nHe looked at my dad and asked "Did he really do this?" My dad, although enamored with the game himself, responded "Sadly, yes." (I would rather fly than play baseball or whatever) My dad's boss then took me to a 737 which was about an hour from departure. My dad's boss, my dad, and myself all walked into the cockpit, where the boss said to the pilot "Show me your logbook." (Every pilot has their own, and if they get filled up, they carry over like a checkbook) After looking at the logbook for a considerable amount of time, he said to the pilot "Impressive stuff captain, how long have you been flying?" He responded "Since I was 17 sir, and I'm 27 now, so 10 years."\n\n"Good for you captain, however would you like to see something impressive? Check this out." He handed the pilot my logbook. After the pilot was done leafing through it, he looked in disbelief and said "Hell, you're more qualified to fly this plane than I am." I then looked at his logbook, which had totaled just under 4k hours, and less than a quarter of my landings.\n\nLater that day, we went to the disastrous landings simulator, which tested pilot's abilities to land in the weird extremes of Cleveland weather, and the boss had the people running the simulator set it up for a 5min takeoff session, 5min  at cruise, and landing from 20k ft. I flew the simulator, and when I got out, the boss said to me "If you were 16, I'd hand you your license right now, and take you down to the Continental offices downstairs."\n\nSo yeah, thats the reason why I love this game, and it has been such a big part of both me and my childhood.\n\n**My dad's boss is the SuperIntendant of the airport, basically he rules all\n**What did 5000 hours do to me? Make me good at flying in simulators\n**Yes, I have flown a plane in real life. Cessna 172 and Piper Cherokee\n**No, I do not have my pilot's license\n**I broke 4 different joysticks out of wear and tear during that time\n\nTLDR: On the original version of this game, I put more than 5k hours into flight time, decide for yourself if I think its good or not.","April 27, 2015","true","27.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","8","10","5","0"

Steam made that a reality. I have to say, even with its shortcommings due to age (the occasinal dll runtime crash,weird resolutions, glitchy load ins and other annoying bugs) the game runs at about 95% perfect. It is SO much fun to play. I dusted off a Saitek Cyborg joystick for this one and it works great. The xbox 360 controller works pretty good, but you will want to remap. I truly enjoy this. I picked it up for $5 and I could say I would pay up to $10 MAYBE 15 and it be worth it considering it does have issues, but I would wait until it is on sale before buying IMHO. $24.99 just seems a bit steep for this. I have only dabbled into the multiplayer a few times and I really like it. The missions are great and of course free flight is the best. I love flying. This is a solid 9/10 with one point knocked off for some glitches and crashes. Otherwise have at it!

I got it about a year ago when it was on sale for $5.00. When my friend found out, he was as excited as I was.\n\nSimply put, it was the best $5 I ever spent. I love FSX:SE. As this was my first full fledge flight simulator, I didn't need all the bells and whistles of newer flight sims such as X-Plane. I just enjoyed flying planes. I really learned a lot playing this game, as it taught me the basics of aircraft flight. I started off on small Cessnas and Pipers but gradually worked my way up to larger Boeings. The default aircraft are good but not perfect. If you are just beginning, you won't be able to tell the difference, but if you are an experienced flight simmer/actual pilot, you will see some things missing. However, if you get bored with the default aircraft, you can always download more planes for free at simviation.com.\n\nThe multiplayer is very fun. The Steam multiplayer works well and I enjoy flying formations and airline hops with other players online. As a member of the FSX Competition Center, I can participate in landing competitions online. However, I do have a few complaints about multiplayer. The first is that the microphone communication is TERRIBLE - it's almost impossible to make out anything anyone says. It is for this reason that most servers use TeamSpeak to communicate. I personally prefer using the chat box. My other issue is that you can't use the direct connect feature - which prevents FSX:SE from playing online multiplayer with FSX Boxed. This was something dissapointing I found out when I tried playing with my friend - luckily, he recently purchased FSX:SE himself, so now we can do multiplayer! My last problem isn't with the multiplayer itself, but with the people. Many people on the SE multiplayer are less experienced than people who played the boxed edition. So if you want the most realistic ATC multiplayer possible, you may want to get VATSIM (which works great with FSX:SE BTW).\n\nThe graphics are nothing special, considering this game is over 10 years old. But I can ignore poor graphics if the gameplay is good, which the gameplay in FSX is OUTSTANDINGLY FUN!!! However, if you want improved graphics, they have addons for that.\n\nThe most notable thing about FSX:SE is how WELL it runs on my PC. My laptop is far from a gaming powerhouse, and it even struggles to run some of the most basic games at times. However, at times, I am getting maximum framerates on FSX:SE at high settings! FSX:SE is the most playable game on my PC by far, so if your PC is weak, don't worry, it will likely handle FSX:SE fine. Also, I'm running Windows 7.\n\nIn the end, FSX:SE is a great flight simulator. It has excited me for hours and taught me a lot about aviation in the process. It may have even inspired me to eventually get a real pilot's liscence! If you are a beginner or expert in flight simming, and you want an excellent flight simulator that will grow with you, then FSX:SE is the game for you. I give it a 9.5/10.\n\nTip: Be sure to pick up the game when it is on sale, as the price sometimes drops as low as $5.00!","March 31","true","256.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

The selection of planes is very good, most heavily focusing on commercial planes, from small single-props to the all-mighty 747.  The missions make for great structured gameplay, and you do not have to follow all the instructions, just complete the overall objective (finish the race, land the plane, go here, go there, etc.).  Also, the map in-game covers the entire world, so you can chart a flight from Laguardia in New York and actually fly to Heathrow  in England or LAX in California.  Just make sure that your plane has enough fuel so you aren't ditching in some mountain range or in the middle of the ocean.\n\nThis game is not for the faint of heart, as it is an excellent simulator, but there is most certainly a lot of fun to be had.","January 6, 2015","true","11.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

And ever since I first played it, I grew a love for flying. While the game has it's up's and downs I do highly reccomend it for those looking for an introduction to flying or those wanting to continue that hobby.\n\n+You have a great variety of default planes to choose from, from the 737, to the classic Cessna Skyhawk, even something like the Piper Cub\n+Game is easy to mod\n+Plenty of add ons planes online, both free and paid\n+/- Haven't tried Multiplayer Yet\n+Hosts a large number of airports to fly through throughout the world including small airstrips you think would not be there\n+Includes the Acceleration Pack so you have the famous F-18, P-51, and EH101 Heli\n+Nice Scenery [if you have your setting up]\n+Very flexible settings for low end and high end PC's\n+Features an AI system where you can fly with AI planes, features setting to change frequency of traffic\n+Has an ATC Radio System you can use in flight\n+Multiplayer has the ability to play ATC instead of pilot [Haven't played that though]\n\n-Cockpits aren't necessarily professional or realistic [There are realism settings but those looking for more professional cockpits that you have to program preflight, look for payware planes by CaptainSim, Aerosoft, or Wilco Publishing]\n-P-51 for some reason is unbalanced in fuel, Plane leans to the left in flight\n-All the addons on Steam do not have dynamic missions but premade flights.\n-There are some scenery glitches such as airstrips sitting in large holes or sitting on plateaus suspended in air [wtf?]\n\nAll in all, I give the game a 9/10.

I had a lot of games before they came to steam and i never thought about that they should run better here.\n\nAnd if you need the sdk to develop new things (yay its so easy anyone can do this *sarcasm* get the boxed version with sdk for 10 bucks - thats just something completely irrelevant for a normal guy who just wants to play).\n\nPersonally im happy that this simulation was introduced here. It was at 5$ the time i bought it and i thought "lets give it a try". And i love it so far. Just be warned that you have to spend ALOT of additional money to improve it (aircraft,atc,fscaptain,scenery.landclass.. it goes on and on).\n\nOnly negative thing for me is that this game really isnt made for triplescreen setups which im used to.\nBorderless windowmode on mainscreen i usually get the wanted 30+ fps with orbx,rex4,softclouds, weather engine and so on. And in the end it isnt that bad to undock panels and move them to other screens / watch your flight in a flightplanner.. whatever...\n\nIs it compatible with every addon released ... NO\nDoes that bother me?... hell NO\nYou can easily check the forums or other sites to see what is working. And most of the important stuff works.\nLike in every other simulator you sometimes have to find workarounds... edit config files... but if you are into that kind of games you should be used to it.\n\nAt least for me this game works perfect. no crashes so far. everything is running smooth after finetuning things.\nJust remember its a simulator.

When you account for its true age (10/2006) it makes it even more astonishing. While only being on steam for a short while most of the modding community have embraced it although I will go into detail with this later.\n\nThe unmodified experience is great, until you start getting into it more. For my first 100-120 hours I was playing with just the base game planes and free online mods and it was plenty of fun. But once you decide to really get into it, say hello to montly subscriptions, goodbye to $500+ in addons and much more!\nHere is my summary though.\n\nAir Traffic Control:\nThe Air Traffic Control in hine sight is terrible but I never knew at the time not with only being new to the community, now I am a member of Vatsim and a paying customer of PilotEdge to get online ATC which greatly improves your experience.\n\nPlanes:\nAfter that is sorted you get into the issue of planes. If you are happy with the stock planes, I urge you to continue using them because once you decide to expand on your library and get premium planes you struggle to go back to the limited ones. When purchasing planes also dont go crazy on your first purchase, and buy adverage planes. My first payware plane was the Just Flight Boeing 737-200Adv. and it is alright but as I continued to advance I discovered the wonderful world of PMDG. They are from my understanding the best addon company for planes on the market. I started off with their flagship, the 777-200LR/F package, a truly fantastic plane and then advanced to purchase the BAe 41 Jetstream which is where I run into my first truly major con of Steam Edtion. I learnt the hard way that not every mod is compatable with Steam Edition, and I can not urge you enough to ensure that any mod you purchase clearly states that it is supported because spending $50 on a unsupported mod does not make you happy (There are work arounds but it is not perfect). I am now wanting to add few more planes to my fleet then will be happy with that department.\n\nScenary:\nI am yet to purchase scenary mods because I personally like to fly all over the world so purchasing scenary is just not going to work for me yet. But the option is there and the built in stuff is terrible but changing it costs a lot. If you fly in one area and VFR a lot then I couldnt recommend anything better.\n\nGameplay Mods:\nThe final polish in my opinion is mods like GSX (Ground Services), FS2Crew (Co-Pilot/Voice control), FSIPanel (Training) and many others that just add so much to the overall experince. GSX was the first thing I added to my collection because it makes all the time you spend on the ground a little bit more fun and the I got FS2Crew with my 777 which makes the games fantastic. FSIPanel is new to my collection and I am still to really play around with it but it will help make me a much better pilot. I also have mods like FSPassengers which add a goal to the game, to run an airline but that didn't appeal to me much. It will make some people enjoy it a lot more though. These either mean a lot to you or just about nothing, but to me these are probably the most important.\n\nConclusion:\nI get asked a lot how do you have so many hours in that game. I reply I dont know :P At first look it looks boring but once you really get into it and put the time into planning out what you are going to do, roleplay and do it it is really damn fun. It has cost me a lot to get it to where i have it and it was not easy, trail and error like anything I guess.\nThis game is not for everyone but I can not suggest it more to anyone that is really into planes.","November 11, 2015","true","321.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","1"

It has kept the same level of realism and compatibility with most after market add ons. I have not had any problems adding Blue Sky Scenery with helps the ground realism (in select areas) greatly, while also adding many vintage warbirds for truly exciting flying.\nThe added attraction of the multiplayer capability makes an interesting new dimension to flight, where you have to avoid other fliers that may maneuver irregularly. The only drawback to the multiplayer realm is that you get an interpreted display of other's aircraft unless you have the exact same plane installed, with precisely the same name on your system. With there being literally tens of thousands of add-on aircraft and helicopters out there it makes it a guarantee that many, perhaps MOST, will be flying something entirely other than what you see. If there was some way to have the game transmit the appearance of the plane you are flying so others see you as you are, this would add a level of realism that would have me in multiplayer every time I fly.\nI truly enjoy the level of realism FSX has over older versions of Flight Simulator. I've been flying various versions for 27 years and having it available in Windows 10 means that I will still have many more years to enjoy this simulation.","February 21","true","355.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I've clocked over 1000 hours in the game, half on Vatsim/Multiplayer, other half offline. The game was tremendously helpful in my pursuit of my private pilot's license. I've been wanting a modernized flight simulator that runs on a modern OS since Windows 8 came out. I've heard of Prepar3d but I do not like its EULA policy even though I'm an undergraduate student and I'm qualified for its academic license. The interface and software for Lockheed's variant is tailored for flight training institutions and for professional environments and it's not very user friendly for the home user. I thought about converting to X-Plane but couldn't commit because I already have so many add-ons for FSX. Fast forward to 2014 and Windows 10, FSX was released on Steam (which by the way I couldn't believe, but very happy) from Dovetail and after downloading and installing the game, it was compatible 100% with Windows 10, no tweaking needed. Not only that but Dovetail made several improvements to the game even after Microsoft released Service Pack 2/Acceleration for FSX in 2007, a big one being adding their own multiplayer since GameSpy servers were shut down, major optimization for framerate issues and so on. PMDG and 90% of my addons work well with the Steam Edition and the other 10% have updates that make it compatible as well. Overall it’s a good competition to other Flight Simulators already out there and I can’t wait until Dovetail announces their new plans for 2016.","April 22","true","49.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I've played tons of flight simulators and none of them come close to FSX. The real time weather is fantasticly accurate and when played on the highest realism settings the aircraft behaves as one would in said weather. The pockets of turbulence above a rise, the shift in heading from a headwind. It's very, very accurate. I find flying on here is probably one of the most relaxing things my PC has to offer me. GET A JOYSTICK.\n\n\n\nPros: 8/10\n\n1. The landscape is decent. It looks dated. But that's because it is. The size relationships between the aircraft and the buildings is a bit off but it works.\n2. Very realistic both in aircraft interior/exterior apperance and in flight dynamics.\n3. Missions are fun (I tend to re-run them for better metrics like time when I'm bored).\n4. The handbook and lessons are helpful.\n5. When used properly the ATC radio communications are very realistic.\n\n\n\nCons: 7/10 (points subtracted for cons)\n\n1.  Not a lot of choices for aircraft. Would like to see more jets/jumbojets/helicopters etc.\n2. Multiplayer VOIP is broken. Period. It doesn't work right. Maybe ONCE in a blue moon you'll come across a server with a working VOIP system, but that it superbly rare.\n3. The airports are... disappointing. Microsoft claims they're accurate representations of the airports. But they're not. They're really not. They're close enough that you can ignore it, but don't make a claim about being "accurate representations" of something if it's really not. And no it's not because it's been a lot of time since the game was released. RDU International Airport never looked that way.\n\n\n\nReplay Value: 10/10\n\nI've been playing this particular game for 10 years now. Enough said.","March 31, 2015","true","10.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

When I first bought FSX, I thought the technology of the plane would be too complicated for me, and that I wouldn't be able to enjoy the game due to me not having the throttle. I was wrong. While you do have lots of tech at your disposal (Especially in larger planes like the 747), most of the tech is optional. After watching a quick Youtube tutorial, I was already a pro! On my first take off(In Moscow), I crashed several times (but I had fun). Then I tried doing an actual flight, from Montreal (YUL), to Ottawa on a smaller plane (I tried with a 737, I failed), I enjoyed the beautiful and realistic views during the flight, I failed the landing. To this day, I still fail at landing. I remember doing a longer flight, going from Shanghai (Pudong) to the Japanese coast in a fighter jet, that is the farthest flight I have ever done. I love the game, I enjoy doing flights, seeing the beautiful and realistic views. This game is perfect for people that love exploring the world, the game is also good for people that like simulation games and people interested in aviation. I would recommend this game to any patient gamer. I give Microsoft Flight Simulator X an 8/10 realistic and very fun\n-Zawx","March 28","true","9.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Microsoft stopped further development of the base platforms, which failed to keep up  with the progress of the computers on which they run. The most recent problem for me has been compatability issues around windows 10. I have re installed a clean windows seven and started again. I have downloaded FSX Steam and bought the FSX Steam CD's ( I have always preferred to keep the disks, there's something comforting about not having to rely on the  downloads).  I am writing simply to say that Dovetail / Steam has done a terrific job with the Flight Sim base programme which gives me better frame rates and an ability to re - install all that I have wanted to from my extensive library of add ons. I have learned that it can be a real challenge with some of the installs and finding your way into the FSX files has been a bit clumsy (so that I can install directly into the file instead of trying to run an install, which older add -ons can't navigate). But I honestly have recovered everything I want from my older add - ons. Very pleased, thank you. I am x- Brize Norton with a passion for the VC10.

A lot has changed since then. I’ve passed quite a few grades in school, I have a much more powerful system to play games on (I mean schoolwork… yes), and Steam is an integral part of my day to day activities.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=623900512\nWhat hasn’t really changed is Microsoft Flight Simulator. A lot of the elements, such as being a reasonably build product, hasn’t changed. MS Flight Simulator X is probably one of the last in a long line of flight simulators.\n\nBeing on Sale for 75% off I thought I might as well pay for the Premium version, it was less than if I was to just pay for the base game without any discount. Some of the DLC content is really just gimmicks, such as Rex Texture 4, which just changes runway textures at a cost of $27.99.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=623827082\nGoing back to having a powerful system, I thought that a GTX 980Ti would be more than capable of maxing out settings while still providing a very high frame rate. I was kind of wrong in that department, as the game still uses the old DirectX 9. MS Flight Simulator X still has a lot of shaders and what not in DirectX 9, and even states “2.0 Ghz or higher (single core)” as a minimum requirement. Performance isn’t as great as I had hoped. Sure there is a DirectX 10 “preview” option (whatever that means) in the graphics settings, but that doesn’t really help out. A lot of DirectX 10 cards were in customer’s PCs before MS Flight Simulator X was put on the market, it’s just a shame that we will never see an update to address this.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=623765534\nBesides performance, graphics, and overpriced DLC, the core mechanics are great. I was surprised how easy the game was to play with just a keyboard and mouse – I did find myself using the keyboard instead of the mouse most of the time to fly however. It has certainly been a while since I’ve played a proper flight simulator, but I was piloting jet aircraft in a short period of time. If you were to actually play the game seriously, I would recommend buying a joystick at some point.","March 14","true","6.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Spend hours learning to Nav. Spend hours figuring out ILS. Now your ready right? 20-40 hours sunk into it and you are ready for your first airport to airport. Make sure to pick two that are 20 minutes apart in real time, because anything longer will CRASH THE GAME.\n\nSeriously. There is a huge bug in Terrain.dll and it will crash the game WITHOUT FAIL on EVERY flight over a certain length/distance. Gone is any chance to fly from London to Hong Kong or Sydney to LA. Oh, and if you turn on time compression, watch out! It makes it worse!\n\nSo, if you like short flights of 20 minutes or less, to look at terrain not modeled with any accuracy (because Google maps is hard) and then a nice CTD, by all means, pick up this title.\n\nOtherwise avoid as unplayabale as the game has a FUNDAMENTAL FLAW that will NEVER be patched. The community answer is to 1) Turn down settings until the game looks horrible 2) fly short distances 3) do not use time compression.\n\nSure. Again, do not buy this game. Terrain.dll crash.

Even though I already have purchased FSX Acceleration (most updated, complete version of FSX), I decided to purchase the Steam version because the FSX I had before was riddled with "Fatal Errors" and crashes. I was hoping that maybe, just maybe this is finally a stable and playable FSX.\n\nSadly, I was very wrong. The game just stopped responding and crashed about 15 minutes into gameplay. Sure, there are many "fixes" if you keep googling, but why would anyone have to do that? This great game is sadly the product of terrible programming and lousy quality management.\n\nThe developer/publisher was very sly in his Steam post when they said that they made some tweaks here and there. This gave me the impression that they actually fixed the stability issues. Needless to say, they did not.\n\nThis is a classic example of betraying the fans just to cash in. Don't fall for this guys.\n\nPS Just for the record, I am running this on Windows 7 64-bit, i7 3770 (not overclocked), 16GB of DDR3 1600 memory and a Sapphire 7850 2GB.

I have been playing fsx for about 5 years now on the boxed edition, and steam edition seems to be running quite well. The multiplayer is what you remember from gamespy, a bunch of trolls and noobs who are pretty much idiots, but that is ok and expected, especially this early on.  Although the price has risen to almost 12$ now I would still recommend it. It doesn't crash half as much as the old version, and it runs quite a bit smoother.  Although I haven't tried much payware, freeware seems to run perfectly fine if you know what you are doing, and with fsuipc coming out only 2 days after the realese, it looks like it won't be very hard to put on a lot of payware, and there will soon be a community looking to modify it. If you already own fsx boxed version I would try and buy this as quickly as possible, because it soon won't really be worth your money to buy basically a upgrade with multiplayer. If you haven't ever owned fsx boxed, buy it, it will give you a lot of hours just exploring the vast world in different aircraft(even though I have been playing for nearly 5 years, I haven't even seen half of the airports this game has, which is something many exploring style games usually can't say), along with the realism of controlling virtual airplanes almost exactly like the real ones(although this feature will be coming soon once people figure out how to bring in pmdgs, A2a aircraft, etc. into the mix).

Despite the bugs and whatnot.  They game is quite good, and has a multitude of remote airstrips, including grass strips that I was surprised to see.  To reduce bugginess, change any settings before starting your flight.  Accessing the ALT menu seems to reduce the amount of time you can fly before the game crashes.\n\nAlright, so the graphics are quite nice on this Simulator.  This makes for some nice immersion.  However, I'm getting into flying in the real world, and wanted to do some practice flights that I might actually fly to get a feel for them.  I enabled updating weather and everything.  (Highly recommend using the current weather settings)  Here's what would continually happen.  I would take off flying the piper cub, circle slowly to the correct heading and maintain my climb.  Finally I'd level off and settle in for a relaxing flight to a nearby lake.  Suddenly the Windows spinng wheel of loading pops up, and the game closes.  It says checking for problems, a fatal error has occured.  Restarting Microsoft Flight Simulator X.  After all that I'm staring blankly at the setting screen which has also lost the majority of my settings that I just customized.  Ok it's a fluke, let me try again.  After 5 attempts at this, and the game "automatically restarting," I searched for similar occurances.  It seems this game has a good deal of bugs that just simply aren't fixed.  I'm so frustrated, that I may switch back over to GEFS (Google Earth Flight Simulator)  It runs on your browser and has ok graphics.  Oh, and it doesn't randomly crash.","March 15, 2015","true","12.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Now I Fly both versions FSX stand-a-lone on the desktop and FSX-SE on my laptop.

Dovetail has gone above and beyond the call of duty to bring new life to FSX Steam Edition, and it shows! The catalog of items on Steam that are compatible add-ons grows almost daily, and truth be told, about 98% of your previous add-ons WILL WORK with FSX-Steam Edition... Though they cannot "guarantee it". Take it from me, it works.\n\nIf you are a long time simmer who for whatever reason stopped playing, there has never been a better time to download FSX-SE and fire up your favorite aircraft.

I think I've came to a conclusion.\n\nThis is not a game, as anyone who sims would tell you.  Sure, there are little missions and things like that that you can play through and complete an objective, however, the core of the simulator is simply that: simulation.\n\nIf you're thinking about buying FSX simply to play through and complete the missions, this is not for you.  Get a game like "DCS: World" or "War Thunder".  But, if you're part of the small niche that enjoys simulating real life flights, planning flights, practicing VFR or IFR, or anything along those lines, get it.  Even if you don't know much about aviation in general, but you are willing to learn, FSX is a great place to start.\n\nThat being said, FSX isn't flawless.  Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition is not an exception to this.\n\nFSX: Steam Edition is simply a way to get into the wonderful world of flight simulation easily over the quick and painless Steam platform.  There are very minor improvements behind the scenes, but in terms of content and things like that nothing has really changed from what you can get out of the boxed Flight Simulator X.  The only big changes are the fact that "Out of Memory Errors" seem to barley ever happen.  (I've personally only experienced it once, and that was because I didn't tweak much of my game at all.)\n\nBut that brings me to the next part of the entire Flight Simulator X experience, whether you're on the boxed version or Steam.  FSX needs addons, tweaks, and bugfixes.  Stock FSX, simply and quite frankly put, is rudimentary.  The flight models of aircrafts aren't nescessarily accurate and scenery isn't beautiful or photorealistic by any means.  On top of that, FSX can be heavily improved by turning on the buggy DX10 and using Steve's DX10 fixer, but that's another story.\n\nFSX also needs some tweaking to it's config files to work better on modern hardware.  But I'm not going to go into that, there are fantastic guides on the steam page, and internet, that will help you with that.\n\nThe jist of what I'm trying to say is that FSX is something that you're either going to fall in love with, or become just another game that sits in your Steam library untouched.\n\nYou'd want to expect to buy some nice aircraft.  (I personally recommend the "A2A Cessna 172 Trainer", fantastic attention to detail and flight model.)  Those cost money, and while there are freeware aircraft out on the internet, you aren't going to get the level of realism and immersion from big names like A2A or PMDG.  Scenery can be easily supplemented with addons like "Active Sky" or "Orbx" but even then it costs more money and more time from just simulation.  On top of that, you need either a joystick or a yoke and rudder pedals.  You're not going to get away for long just using keyboard and mouse.  It's just not fun.\n\nSo in the end, yes I do reccommend this game.  Very much so, actually.  But you have to be willing to put forth the time and money it takes to get this game looking and feeling as real as it can.","March 15, 2015","true","51.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

There has been no further development of the simulator.  But the DLC list has grown to a staggering $1,168.  We can officially bury all hopes that Dovetail was going to do something other than turn it into another catalog simulator like their Train Simulator has become.\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nWhile it's good to see FSX being picked up by Dovetail,  they could have done a much better job with their release of the steam edition.  I'm honestly on the fence as to recommending this... if you already own the boxed version and have addons... stay away from it.  If you don't have it and would like to get into FSX,  then it is worth it as long as you know the problems ahead of time.  Or in my case...  already own the boxed and have friends that have purchased this and would like to multiplay with me.\n\nThe positives of this edition is a working multiplayer system that is easy to navigate.  And that is part of the reason this game was gifted to me,  to multiplay with friends in the twitch community.\n\nThe cons:\n\nDovetail did very little research into what the FSX community is doing with the game and released a product that does not work with all the major payware addons that are most commonly used.  Have already pushed out a DLC that isn't worth the money,  a plane and some saved flight plans...  there are better freeware aircraft out there.  So to use my exisitng addons I have kept my old "boxed"  copy installed so I can use my addons that I've purchased.\n\nCan only hope that  Dovetail's track record so far with FSX is not going to be the norm that we see in the future.  Wait till the last minute to say they are putting this out,  putting out a product that does not work with the most common addons,  then putting out a DLC of a half finished aircraft with a handfull of saved flight  plans.","January 20, 2015","false","74.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

One of the best things of this version is the framerate. Dovetail did some engine tweaks which causes the game to run very smoothly now. Before this wasn't.\n\nMultiplayer is a sort of back, although there are (yet) a few servers and that's it. At least game-spy is done.\n\nNow, very important to remember: this is not a game. It's a simulator and basically it's kinda hardcore. Don't expect easy handling which makes you just fly. If you are thinking of buying this game, I recommend to buy a joystick as well. It gives you a better experience and makes it just easier.\n\nAddons on fsxinsider.com are payware (which means you have to pay for those addons) ones, yet there are a lot of freeware addons. Just google it.\n\nNow, the game doesn't really have downsides other than the few multiplayer server which people have to host themselves. And there is yet no working multiplayer with the boxed version. It seems they will possibly do some updates... I hope at least.\n\nIn a nutshell:\n\nBuy this game if you are a aviation freak, and buy a joystick or a home cockpit if you want to play seriously. Don't expect this to be a game where you just fly, and I'd love to have people who want to play multiplayer seriously.","December 26, 2014","true","97.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The frame-rate is much better on the Steam version, and the ability to use the internet to play multiplayer makes the game much better as a teaching tool(especially since Gamespy dropped FSX in 2009 or so, I think).\n\nPros: The game is one of the most fun simulators out there.\nYou can use keyboard and mouse to fly, as well as any generic joystick and throttle.\nWith the Steam version, and the right microphone gear, it is very easy to talk with other players over the radio.\n\nCons: The aircraft that come with the game are by default kind of clunky(This can be fixed with updates).\nAlso, there are only about 15 or 20 aircraft types you start with. The small number of choices can be augmented by a number of freeware and payware aircraft available over the internet.

Worked absolutely flawlessly for me from the start, took some work to find the right balance between display quality and performance but I got it to run at an acceptable quality on a computer which really isn't designed for gaming.\n\nReally recommend playing through the lessons if you want to fly seriously. The missions, on the other hand, bring you into the game in a less serious and more fun way - you don't need to be an expert pilot to enjoy FSX!\n\nYou can also improve it with a wealth of freeware (and payware) add ons which can really enhance your experience. Yes the DLCs are expensive, but you do not NEED them to have a very good game. In terms of freeware, I recommend Plan-G  as a great little piece of software to plan and carry out VFR flights.\n\nI play it using an Xbox One controller - it works, and it allows you to fly to a decent standard. Joystick is probably better, but you can certainly have fun with a console controller if that is all you have access to. Keyboard on the other hand is a bit difficult in my opinion.\n\nI would really recommend this game if you have already played it before or if you are new to flight simulation. Stick with it through the learning curve and you'll really unlock hundreds of hours of potential fun, either offline or online with friends or through services like VATSIM.","March 29, 2015","true","23.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I tried a friend's copy of FSX years ago, and my computer was not up to snuff at the time. During it's time, it was cutting edge.\n\nNow, it runs amazingly well on my computer, which is a modest 3Ghz machine with 2 gigs memory running Windows 7. I've had 0 crashes, and am very pleased to see many add-on developers adding support for FSX:SE as well. The developer has made multiplayer work relatively well, as long as you know how to configure your firewall hardware or software. (This is an issue with ALL multiplayer games that don't just use a big central server.)\n\nOn to the real review:\n\nFSX is more of a simulator than a game. It cannot compare to the $200+ simulators out there, of course... but then again, it's around 10 years old. What it does have is BEAUTIFUL graphics, an amazingly huge world, and aircraft that respond in a realistic manner. Do not be heavy handed with the controls, you will meet Charlie Brown's Kite Eating Tree -- Only it's bigger, and eats 737's.\n\n\nYou get realistic ATC, wonderful weather, and a huge community of addon developers and players that adore flying and aircraft. You can fly with your friends, not only on missions and whatnot, but also both of you sharing control of one aircraft, to allow the more experienced pilot to train the less experienced.\n\nThe game includes tutorials on proper flight procedures, Air Traffic Control, single engine, multi engine, and commercial flight. This "game" is a wonderful experience for aircraft enthusiasts and comes out of the box with a wide variety of fun aircraft... IT is not a shooter, however. You won't be bombing places, or shooting down your friends... However, you CAN set up fly-in's, races, and many other fun activities!\n\nWould recommend to anyone with a joystick, definitely! (Flying with the mouse and keyboard is doable, but not quite as fun, IMO)","January 5, 2015","true","110.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you are getting this game to join a session with professional atc then your out of luck! You wont get that, the game is filled with trolls that bough the game in the sale that join a session, play crap down the mic, crash into you and have no intention of playing the game properly. If you want a completely proffesional game you will need to set up vatsim but first you need to know the ins and outs of the plane. FSX is like the tariner sim, atc arent that importatnt right now and you can just go on free flight if you want no trolls and have atc. However in multiplayer you can share your aircraft and if youy have a friend witht he game sharing the aircraft with them is awesome. In my opinion i would buy this game in a sale, when it is around £5 and if you really enjoy it and want a more professional sim, when you are ready download vatsim/vpilot buy a payware plane and maybe some scenery packs. Yes to really make the game amazing youy have to pay but in the end it is worth it.","June 28, 2015","true","127.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The Multiplayer seems to be all there too with the Steam server so you can connect and Fly with other enthusiasts and friends now, which is good news and a lot less hassel.\nI got the premium edition which wqas on offer at the time and it came with a few extra bells and whistles so there are extra textures and Sky, airports, sounds rain, Thunder, wind, there are planes etc, which is good. All in all a good buy up to now, and very few if any at all problems. I'm on Win 10 it loaded up there was a error "Vcredistx86", but sorted that out by itself really.\nI do recommend this game, it's what i like in a flight sim. and if your new to flight sims you can't go to wrong with this one.","March 31","true","79.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is still the best flight sim for civilian aircraft.  The guys from the train Sim team may have rushed things a bit with this release though.\n\nThe scripts for flight instructors (the files that make them talk & teach) in the learning center do not load or are not present in this steam version of the game. (I have the Boxed FS gold version as well where they do work)\n\nThese are hugely important for immersion, as well as for new guys wanting to learn how to do things like ILS approaches, Instrument flying. Pretty much everything in the learning center/ training part of the game is not useable at this time.\n\nHopefully this problem will be sorted quickly as this is one of the things that has made FSX so excellent in the past. I will be crossing my fingers and hoping we get a patch in the next week or two.\n\nI will give this a 3/5 since the game is missing some key parts.\n\nEverything else seems to work very nicely.  Good game & a must have for any flight Sim-er.","December 21, 2014","true","37.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It may not. It works for me, so I'm posting a positive review.\n\nI can fly anywhere in the world. This game is truly amazing. There are over 20,000 airports in this game. Even in a small island country there are airports.\n\nIf you don't have a joystick yet, you can still play this game but I'd really recommend getting a joystick as it's sort of hard to control the plane with just the keyboard. If you're flying a jet, you're more than likely going to be using autopilot most of the time, so it won't really matter anyways.\n\nAt the time of posting this (22/12/14)  a lot of addons for the DVD game isn't working. The devs may fix that, they may not.  However, the amount of content in this game is still outstanding. You have over 20 planes that you can play and mess around with it. If you really like flight games, then this is the game for you.\n\nIf you'd like a more combat-oriented game, then check out DCS world.

This sim is extremely capable of supporting virtually all types of flying machines, from seaplanes to supersonic aircraft. Unfortunately, the selection of aircraft is rather poor with the stock game so you have to get addons as a way to really enjoy the sim. These addons include aircraft, ships, tanks, cars (yes, I have seen cars!) and modifications for the AI traffic and many others. There are literally so many addons out there that every single person will find more than 1 thing they like. Google search for instance, "Bristol Britannia FSX" or "Dornier Do-28 FSX" and you will find the aircraft and the site that has it usually has a bunch more aircraft.

I opened it and found 3 discs: one for all the military aircraft, and 2 for public aviation. I was (and still am) more interested in public aviation, so I plopped in Disc 2, but it didn't do anything. I inserted Disc 1, and installation started. About half-way, it asked to insert Disc 2, so that's what I did, and installation completed. I played with it for a little bit, and closed it, just to do something else. When I came back and re-opened the application, it asked to repair or un-install the game, so I selected to repair the game, and of course, half-way there it asked to insert Disc 2. When repairing was done, I clicked "Finished", and nothing happened. Disc 2 was apparently for installation ONLY, so when I re-inserted Disc 1, it asked to repair or uninstall, again. I set the box back on my shelf, and let it collect dust again.\n\nA few days before Christmas, I noticed that FSX:SE was out for a discount of $4.99, so I purchased it immediately. I was very pleased to now have a permanent flight simulator.\n\nI don't understand why Dovetail is releasing useless DLC's for ridiculous amounts of money.  Instead of falling for Dovetail's useless DLC's, you should get third-party payware (i.e. Airbus X Extended, 737 NGX, GSX, etc.), or save up for it. Otherwise, enjoy using the default aircraft. Not much payware is yet compatible with Steam Edition, so if you really want something that's not out yet, simply wait or request the developer to make it compatible. The game can't be played offline, so if your internet cuts out, you'll have to wait until it comes back so you can start up FSX. If you have the original FSX, KEEP IT, unless you want multiplayer. If you are going to get FSX, but only have Steam Edition as an option, good luck trying to keep yourself from writing a negative review. Remember that you should not rely on Dovetail to make this game better, as it seems they're doing nothing to fix any bugs.\n\nOtherwise, I recommend this game for enthusiasts who don't mind spending their savings on third-party payware, or if they just want to fly around.","March 14, 2015","true","520.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/baggageclaim/recommended/314160/","baggageclaim","GrassHopper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/baggageclaim/","18 products in account","This game and I have had an extremely long relationship. Back when I had just turned 10 years old I saw a youtube video of a trike ultralight landing at a major airport in fsx and I thought to myself, it would be cool to do that. Then I quickly searched it up and came up with a sight where I could download the demo. At the time I was really into the show "Flying Wild Alaska" on the Discovery channel which was about pilots making a living flying in Alaska. So, as soon as I got in game my goal was to recreate the flights in the show. In the demo you got only a few planes a few airports and a few missions and it put you in TNCM which is near the equator so my hopes of recreating those flights were ruined... Or were they? After a while of messing about only using keyboard and mouse (and pausing the game every 3 seconds to make adjustments) I realised that this would probably be easier with a controller so I pulled out my Dad's old Microsoft Precision Pro (Best joystick ever nothing even comes close in my opinion) and found the USB adapter plugged it in and had a go. I quickly realised that it was so much easier to control with a joystick and my interest for the game only grew. After a while of searching on the internet I found a freeware website where I could get planes and scenery made by others and then I realized that I could recreate the flights in the show with those planes. I downloaded a bunch of single engined props and started messing with the weather to get the desired conditions. After an hour of having fun with that I realized 2 things 1: Demo limits your time 2: Some guages in freeware aircraft are missing. This kind of lowered my hopes as I thought I would have to pay hundreds for the full version but when I searched it on Amazon it was only $35 and It was close to my birthday so I made my parents get it. While waiting for FSX to arrive I came across the FSX film making communities on Youtube and fell in love with this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fej9EWWLSsw And that gave me a new goal: Find all the planes in that video and install them. When I got the game though, I forgot all those goals, installed the game, and installed a freeware Tiger Moth Biplane. Then I proceded to start a five hour flight Between Denver Intl. and Housten. this took me a few days at about an hour each day and a lot of saving. After completing the flight I started to explore the other parts of the game and this led me to multiplayer. From there I found a server which was doing landing competions I joined in the middle of one, failed and strived to be the best at the competitions which improved my overall game skill. (Big Shoutout to kilocharlie1, he and I have been friends since 2011 and met during one of his landing competitions). During the next 3000 hours spent on the boxed version of FSX I learned more and had more interactions with people with interesting perspectives and thoughts than I ever had in my real life. I went through multiple "Phases" while playing this game also like "craving": Pre-WWI aircraft, Biplanes with exposed radial engines, WWII aircraft, Turboprops, A2A only aircraft, etc. and all that research into those aircraft and such gave my more historical knowledge than I had ever learned in school. It also helped me gain the abilities to think logically and visually and to deeply understand certain workings of physics even though I had never studied them deeply before this game. This game is what brought me into PC gaming, kept me busy, educated me, and entertained me. Would HIGHLY reccomend  for anyone of any background of nearly any age to experiment and have fun in.","July 7, 2015","true","8.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I feel some days it is not as much a game but an operating system. The potential is one of the allures to the game, some days it feels like it is as close as you can get to real world flying and have fun doing it. I own X plane 7 and 9 do not want to argue about realism.  X plane is the cheapest wind tunnel you can buy it can simulate planes that do not exist yet and can do things by the numbers, It is technically better a better simulator, so why not just fly X plane?  I have never been able to completely switch over because Flight Simulator feels more fun.\n\nX Plane uses a Blade element theory to figure out flight.  Lift is simulated by flowing virtual air over an approximation of a virtual wing. This is very good, the feeling of lift and interaction of lift and balance of a plane is well represented. If you design a new plane and want to sort of know if it works you can. It falls short where there are odd drag or flow interactions on a plane that make the perfect math model not match the real world.\n\nFlight Simulator 10 uses Table lookup so the planes are more of a grab bag. They only can simulate the Data and are only as good as the Data in the table. Some mod planes all feel the same because they don't have the flight model they deserve. It is cheaper to calculate the plane this way computer wise.  It has fun multiplayer and with a good plane it is wonderful. If I were to start today I would buy FSX 10 and the A2A piper cub http://store.steampowered.com/app/360080/ and a Joystick, and have fun.\n\nFlight Simulator is not a trouble free game; it is much better as the steam edition then the boxed version of the past. All problems are solvable with some reading, and people are usually nice and knowledgeable. I needed to install the Orbx Felts field and had an error of missing building tops  I needed to write into a forum to get an answer, and it has been patched, but sometimes things don’t always work as you would expect them. I have had good luck with windows 10 no real errors or crashes when flying. I found if when I am choosing a flight and click out of the game window and start looking stuff up on line or starting other programs it will get mad at me and crash. It is a far cry from the boxed edition when I would save on a schedule so I didn’t have to start the flight over from the beginning and crash at the same spot. As long as the crashes are just in the menu and only because I am trying to multitask I can live with that. I also hope with continued development we will see 64-bit version in the future.\n\nIf you want to shoot down stuff, have latest technology or have a very short attention span then this game is not for you. If you love learning new things, detail, tinkering, flying, messing with how computers and graphics work, moding, or honing a skill this could be the game for you.\n\nI own but not the steam version of the A2A cub so I can’t review it on steam, but you can paddle it out on a lake and prop start it like a world war I plane and it is just fun. A2A is one of the best companys out there for DLC for FSX please support them. Can’t recommend the plane enough hope to see more Orbx and A2A stuff on steam.\n","September 11, 2015","true","167.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/baggageclaim/recommended/314160/","baggageclaim","GrassHopper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/baggageclaim/","18 products in account","This game and I have had an extremely long relationship. Back when I had just turned 10 years old I saw a youtube video of a trike ultralight landing at a major airport in fsx and I thought to myself, it would be cool to do that. Then I quickly searched it up and came up with a sight where I could download the demo. At the time I was really into the show "Flying Wild Alaska" on the Discovery channel which was about pilots making a living flying in Alaska. So, as soon as I got in game my goal was to recreate the flights in the show. In the demo you got only a few planes a few airports and a few missions and it put you in TNCM which is near the equator so my hopes of recreating those flights were ruined... Or were they? After a while of messing about only using keyboard and mouse (and pausing the game every 3 seconds to make adjustments) I realised that this would probably be easier with a controller so I pulled out my Dad's old Microsoft Precision Pro (Best joystick ever nothing even comes close in my opinion) and found the USB adapter plugged it in and had a go. I quickly realised that it was so much easier to control with a joystick and my interest for the game only grew. After a while of searching on the internet I found a freeware website where I could get planes and scenery made by others and then I realized that I could recreate the flights in the show with those planes. I downloaded a bunch of single engined props and started messing with the weather to get the desired conditions. After an hour of having fun with that I realized 2 things 1: Demo limits your time 2: Some guages in freeware aircraft are missing. This kind of lowered my hopes as I thought I would have to pay hundreds for the full version but when I searched it on Amazon it was only $35 and It was close to my birthday so I made my parents get it. While waiting for FSX to arrive I came across the FSX film making communities on Youtube and fell in love with this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fej9EWWLSsw And that gave me a new goal: Find all the planes in that video and install them. When I got the game though, I forgot all those goals, installed the game, and installed a freeware Tiger Moth Biplane. Then I proceded to start a five hour flight Between Denver Intl. and Housten. this took me a few days at about an hour each day and a lot of saving. After completing the flight I started to explore the other parts of the game and this led me to multiplayer. From there I found a server which was doing landing competions I joined in the middle of one, failed and strived to be the best at the competitions which improved my overall game skill. (Big Shoutout to kilocharlie1, he and I have been friends since 2011 and met during one of his landing competitions). During the next 3000 hours spent on the boxed version of FSX I learned more and had more interactions with people with interesting perspectives and thoughts than I ever had in my real life. I went through multiple "Phases" while playing this game also like "craving": Pre-WWI aircraft, Biplanes with exposed radial engines, WWII aircraft, Turboprops, A2A only aircraft, etc. and all that research into those aircraft and such gave my more historical knowledge than I had ever learned in school. It also helped me gain the abilities to think logically and visually and to deeply understand certain workings of physics even though I had never studied them deeply before this game. This game is what brought me into PC gaming, kept me busy, educated me, and entertained me. Would HIGHLY reccomend  for anyone of any background of nearly any age to experiment and have fun in.","July 7, 2015","true","8.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Flight Simulator provides Hours of good entertainment leaving you with some real life knowledge about Flight. If you want FSX for just fun or to get a lesson in the fundamentals of Flight expect hours of satisifaction. I'm working my way through the Game menu as it's listed, you can jump to almost any location and try your hand at the experience, FSX get's you in the air quick without boring instruction.

This version has, remarkably, been around since 2006, but has worn amazingly well. While it gets stiff competition nowadays from Prepar3D and X-Plane in particular, it can still more than hold its own.\n\nFor the purposes of this review, I am only going to concentrate on the default, "out-of-the-box" scenery and aircraft - in other words, what you first get when you buy this game. As is the case with P3D and X-Plane, there are numerous add-ons that can enhance the game enormously, but I think the fairest way to review a game like this is focus on what it comes with initially.\n\nOne thing I really love about Microsoft Flight Simulator X (hereinafter: FSX) is the extent to which it teaches you about the basics of flying. Quite aside from tutorial missions, there is a section called the "Learning Center" which has an incredible wealth of information. There are detailed instructions about how to fly each of the default aircraft, for instance. Then too there is a tab in the "Learning Center" called "Lessons". This will give you highly detailed "ground school" articles by professional flight instructor Rod Machado, along with practical lessons guided by Rod. You will learn the fundamentals of taking off, landing, turning, stalls, VOR/DME/ADF navigation, ILS landings and so much more besides. You can also do checkrides and, if you pass them, get a certificate that will go into your "Pilot Rewards" (an unnecessary but fun component of FSX).\n\n"Boring," you may say. "I want to fly, not study!" Well, there's nothing stopping you from flying straight away if you want. (Indeed, I did.) But take it from me, repeatedly crashing because you have no clue about how to land a plane, or much of a clue about any aspect of flying, is not a lot of fun. Yes, it may take a bit of time to go through Rod Machado's lessons and study some of the other articles in the Learning Center, but it will enhance your experience of the sim enormously in the long run. And it is immensely satisfying when you apply what you have learned and begin to master new skills. FSX can, if you are willing to make the effort, train you in a way that its rival X-Plane will not. (I don't know about Prepar3D, so can't comment on how helpful or otherwise it is to flying and flight simming novices.)\n\nThere are two main ways you can play FSX. The first is "Free Flight". With this mode, you can select an airport and simply take off from it to go wherever. Or you can file a proper flight plan and fly from one airport to the next. If you change your mind mid-flight, just open up the appropriate menu and file another flight plan. You get pretty much the whole world - including Antarctica - to fly in. You also get plenty of noteworthy landmarks to see.\n\nThe other main playing mode is Missions. There is a great variety of different missions you can do, with difficulty levels ranging from "Beginner" to "Expert". Some of the missions seem a bit mis-classified though. Several of the "Beginner" lessons require some pretty advanced piloting skills, although you don't have to know about navigation or ATC interaction to fly them. In that sense, they are "Beginner" difficulty, but they're otherwise really hard. Other missions are more straightforward though. The missions are a good way to get acquainted with the different kinds of aircraft that FSX has to offer and see what types you like best (I discovered for instance that I really enjoy GA planes and airliners, but can take or leave helicopters and gliders aren't my scene at all). They are also a good way to challenge yourself in a variety of interesting situations. And if the default missions aren't to your liking or just aren't enough for you, there is no shortage of mission packs on offer (such as "Cargo Crew", "Arctic Rescue" and "Dangerous Approaches" available here on Steam). You get rewards for passing missions (nothing that special, just a "sticker" in your Pilot Records, but still, quite good fun).\n\nActually, there is also a third mode: Multiplayer. However, I have never used that, so can't comment on how good or otherwise it is. All I will say is that it doubtless adds another dimension if you want to use it.\n\nPlanning a flight couldn't get much easier in FSX. This process is very intuitive and easy to learn. I especially love the Navigation Log that is generated, and which you can refer to on your "Kneeboard" (press Shift + F10 for that) during a flight. Interacting with ATC is also very straightforward. The ATC window can be used to auto-tune your "comms" radio, although you can also quite easily tune radios manually if you want to do things more like a real pilot. Aircraft come with both 3D virtual cockpits and 2D panels. When you're in 2D mode, you can make mini-panels pop up (press Shift + 1, 2, 3 etc.) that give you access to things like the radio stack, throttle quadrant and overhead panel. Very handy, and saves a lot of fumbling around trying to find where things are.\n\nAs seriously awesome as this game is however, it is not without its faults. The "out-of-the-box" scenery of instance is pretty blah. Cities - especially less well-known ones - are not very accurately rendered, and the textures are decidedly average. Topography is one area where X-Plane 10 beats FSX hands-down. However, there are plenty of add-ons to improve the scenery (I especially recommend Orbx's FTX products), and at least FSX gives you buildings at airports, which certainly can't be said for X-Plane in a lot of cases! In flight dynamics too, FSX can be a bit ho-hum, especially when it comes to helicopters. Taxiing can also be rather fiddly. The "Pilot Records" section is a bit of a mess. It would be nice if some real airlines were represented rather than just generic ones (although it's quite easy to add new liveries). And because FSX is so old, it is only capable of running in 32-bit mode, which means that it tends to struggle with more sophisticated add-ons.\n\nThat said, there is a vast amount of add-ons out there, and you can do a tremendous amount to FSX without breaking it. But the more advanced computers become and the more sophisticated add-ons get, the more FSX will struggle in the future. For now though, it still works very well and there are so many great ways to enhance it. Steam alone offers a lot of great add-ons, but there are more to discover at places like The FlightSim Store or Just Flight. No shortage of freeware to be found either (check the AVSIM Library for instance).\n\nAnother thing I sometimes struggle with is visibility. However, a neat trick I have discovered is to open a "mini-window" while in 2D panel mode and set this "mini-window" to Outside Spot view. This way, I can keep an eye on my instruments while being able to see easily to taxi or land. Best of both worlds!\n\nAll in all, I recommend Microsoft Flight Simulator X very highly indeed. If you are new to flight simming and flying generally, as I was when I bought this game a little over a year ago, this game, with its Learning Center, will teach you a tremendous amount. It gives you a far better grounding in the basics of flying than X-Plane, which is really designed for people who already have a reasonable amount of experience. (Again, I don't know how novice-friendly or otherwise Prepar3D is.) And once you have grasped the fundamentals of flying, there is no end of fun to be had and discoveries to make. Be warned though that it is quite addictive once you master it (also the case with real flying, so I've heard), and while the basic game is very cheap (certainly a better deal initially than X-Plane or Prepar3D), your wallet can still suffer as you chase after add-ons to further fuel your virtual flying addiction. You may or may not be in love with flying (virtually or otherwise) now, but once you have played FSX, you will be!","March 12","true","561.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have had the boxed versions for many years, and logged many hours, but have not played it in a long while. Being a real pilot and instructor I reverted to Xplane for most of my simming, but was looking forward to FSX again once I heard that it was coming to steam. I downloaded it and popped it onto my laptop, it ran smooth and i was able to max out all the graphic settings and it worked fine. I took a quick flight in a couple of my old favorite planes and flew around abit and shot an approach. Ran great and looked just as how I remembered it. One thing that I like in Mircosoft vs. Xplane is the ATC system and it was working just as I remembered. Bottom line just Great Fun!!! and at the current hoiliday sale price it would be a crime to pass it up. I do prefer Xplane a little more, but they are both great and have slightly different advantages and disadvantages, I enjoy having both.\nFSX is just plain fun and runs great!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/derpherper/recommended/314160/","derpherper","Derpmau","http://steamcommunity.com/id/derpherper/","358 products in account","Wow! I wasn't expecting this to be released any time soon on steam. I was aware that earlier in the year Dovetail was going to publish this as a Steam edition version, but I definitley didn't expect it to come out day 1 of the Winter sale and for 5 dollars on sale (25 USD regular). There was a time I felt like a few months ago that it would be great to finally actually own a legit copy of the sim I spent so much time on - but boxed versions on Amazon were becoming increasingly rare and expensive. Now, I'm happy I can have this forever through a decent game client. Yes!!\n\nJust to set some things clear, I've spent tons of hours in the non steam version of FSX: Acceleration. I switched to, and now own Prepar3d V2 Academic a few months ago (basically FSX but optimized as much as possible for DX11 features and some other tweaks to that effect) and a variety of addons. I still think P3D is probably the best you can get for a modern 2014 PC if you want the FSX experience, being as it gets frequent performance updates and has DX11 lighting, etc - but it isn't on Steam, and is 50 dollars for an academic license. There is also the somewhat large issue that most of the FSX addons either don't work in P3D, have some kind of yakety way of overcoming that, or are just flat out not compatible with P3D. So what do you do if you want modern performance enhancements, but want to use your addons?\n\nEnter the Steam Edition. Reading the changelog of the SE version, you can see that Dovetail has taken the best fixes and tweaks that flight simmers have analyzed and tinkered with tooth and nail since 2006 to get the sim working well and incorporated it into FSX. If you enjoy doing .cfg tweaks; you still can, but the workload is much less to worry about if you're just wanting to hop in and fly in regards to performance. the HIGHMEMFIX entry, the uiautomationcore.dll, all of that stuff is a part of this package. Anyone who frequently installed or messed with FSX Accel would know all too well about these "annoyances" (in my opinion) and would be happy that they're finally here by default.\n\nI cannot speak high enough of the sim. The only thing that I never really liked was the infinite tweaking I had to do to get blurry textures to load faster, frame rate to become stable, and the dozens of frame limiting programs and graphic card tweaking I had to do to get an extra frame or so - all recommended by people who were in no way involved in the actual development process. For the longest time, this sim has had to stand on the legs of the community propping it up - which in itself isn't a bad thing at all - just a very slow and tedious way of improving the sim as much as possible, which in my opinion could have happened a lot faster if the original dev team supporting it were still around. Is this sim now so well optimized that you no longer need to tweak? Probably not, but this edition is about half the battle already.\n\nTo wrap this recommendation up, the things I'm most happy/sad about in this edition are:\n\nThe long known optimization tweaks being implemented as standard, the newer splash screen, the multiplayer coming back (it was so sad when the boxed version's multiplayer died :'[ ) The real world Jeppensen weather feature now back and able to download for real weather anywhere in the world, and the Steam integration. I can also use REX Natural ENB with this without errors. The negative? Some of my FSX addons as of SE release still do not work with this edition. It is unknown to me why. Texture replacers like REX seem to work fine, but weather engines like my copy of ASN do not. It tells me SimConnect isn't installed when you do in fact install it as a first step of the installation of the sim. Uninstalling and re-installing seem to do nothing. ASN is a weather injector that is highly dynamic, similar to OPUS and the REX weather engine. I use it for P3D, but my purchase also has an FSX version as well - which as stated has these problems. It would be an issue if they had not revived the Jeppensen weather downloader in the sim, which is fine for now, but I'd rather like to use my own weather engine!\n\n\nAll in all, P3Dv2 will still be my main simulator, without a doubt. My Orbx addons are there, my aircraft addons are there, ASN works there, and my REX4 HD textures are compatible there. The lighting is better optimized in DX11, and the scenery, performance and frame rate are consistent. The FSX SE brings back multiplayer, FSX only addons, and some under the hood tweaks that have made it function at an acceptable level again - and that, I think is worth sticking around for.","December 19, 2014","true","25.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I tried many optimization guide on the web and none works for me. My laptop isn't very powerful as it only got a AMD A10-5750m CPU, and Radeon 8670m GPU. At the time, I gave up on FSX, and sticks to FS 2004, as I thought my system isn't powerful enough for FSX. Couple of months later, FSX:SE was launched and I read many reviews on the web stating that it really improved stabilty and FPS (not by a very large margin, the reviewers said). At first i'm not really interested in acquiring the Steam Edition, since I thought my laptop isn't powerful enough for FSX, but then FSX:SE goes on sale for around $2-$3, and I decided to give it a shot. I launched the game for the first time, and surprisingly, none of the lag issue I encountered before was gone. I got a good 50 fps, without any add-ons, and even after installing many add-ons such as ORBX, REX, and AI Traffics I still get around 40 fps, with occasional drop to 20 fps, when i'm flying near third party airport, with many AI Traffics. The only optimization I did was changing the Affinity Mask on fsx.cfg.

However, I'd compare it to paying someone to kick you square in the nuts. Sure, initially it may seem like an exciting prospect, but once you experience the pain and frustration, it's not worth it. So, why would I say such a thing? First, it's unstable. The game crashes frequently (usually, after flying for 30+ minutes!) and the log book corrupts itself. Second, it's unpredictable. I've been unable to complete some of the missions due to the checkpoints not progressing. Third, it requires an additional hardware purchase. Were you planning on exclusively using a keyboard/mouse? Forget about it! You need a joystick. Using a keyboard/mouse is an "all or nothing" approach with no finesse (which you'll desperately need upon approaches and when taxiing). Now, if you already have a joystick and a VR headset, Flight Simulator X is probably an amazing experience, but for a non-pilot casual who just wants to fly some planes, you'll be disappointed (like me).

I've had this game for years when the multiplayer was through GameSpy (long since disconnected) and was very disappointed when the multiplayer support closed.  MANY thanks to Steam for reviving this "Great" game.\n\nNew flight simulators have been released since this program's release in 2006, but this is sill without-a-doubt the most comprehensive, realistic, customizable, and fun flight simulator through 03/2015.  There are also MANY websites that store mods for this game, just search and see what you can find!  Quality control of 3rd-party downloads is up to you though because there really is so much content ranging from airport layout and texture fixes to weather and surface vehicle customizations that noone could possibly check it all.  You can find aircraft as professionally made as the defaults, to crazy craft that defy every law of physics, (made to fit SciFi movies and TV shows of course!) ;-)\n\nThis program helped fuel my passion for flying from the beginning, and I'm now a Certified Flight Instructor in Louisiana, USA.  Another real-life note, some flight training centers that have simulators capable of being used for actual logbook time have used this program.

This version seems slightly more optimized. For a simulator released in 2006, it still looks pretty amazing on the highest settings. This is a great simulator for those who want to start learning the basics of flight and maybe some slightly more advanced stuff. However, me being more experienced in aircraft flight, the controls in each of the aircraft are far too basic. Not enough controls for me to simulate a full on flight but to fix that, all i needed to do was buy a few aircraft from seperate developers for a more realistic and fun flying experience. There are some really good ones out there but no good free ones. Anyway, great simualtor, and for the price, you really can't go wrong. I hope Dovetail release a new Flight Simulator within the next few years, i'm certainly looking forward to it!","March 11, 2015","true","85.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's had some internal tweaks such as improved texture rendering, better Windows 8.1 support and improved multicore optimization (meaning it runs better than the original FSX on the same PC hardware).\nPerhaps the biggest change here is the removal of the defunct Gamespy multiplayer mode, replaced with an all-new Steam online multiplayer. It now syncs with Steam social functions and servers, bringing FSX multiplayer back online for the first time in years. A welcome addition.\nAt the moment of writing this there's a major glitch with the game which prevents it from opening when offline. There's a patch in the works due within a week or so (available as an open beta on Steam now) which fixes this, though.\n\nOverall, 9/10.

I do run some addons that are freebies and after 5 hours or so I get the crash 99% of the time only because of the manual crew addon I have ( pressing a button to play a crew announcment ). Altho I have wanted to see actual people unloading my plane and people moving about as I have seen in videos. My current vid card supports shader 5.0 and the game says must support 2.0, and DX 10 mine handles DX 11. Now that still can be my vid card itself and my system configurations ( still working and testing those settings ) I did add the freeware and demo of Orbx ( the free airports and 2 ground stuff ) no issues at all with them.\n\nIt is very nice to see that Dove Tail added some different planes / choppers to the mix vs the box version. And as I have "only read" fixing issues with windows 8 that the boxed version won't ever do.\nSomething I have seen all over the reviews and forums is people saying 1 they crash all the time still and you can't play off line.\nThe off line part yes would be nice to see them fix that for those that lose internet I have always been a hater to places like Steam for that one reason. I have lost my internet before and wanted to play a game I have been working on and can't because of no net connecton to verify. ( I haven't tried steam yet on this one... but I have another one that I can log in launch the game disconnet from the net play and exit and relaunch without the net connected like it stores the verifcation after first launch.) But off that rant lol\n\nCrashing durring play all the time well that can be tons of reasons with both gamer machines and store bought.\nAs a RL computer person for many years here would be my questons for them\nWhat kind of comp are you using? do you have on board or extended graphics? how much stuff do you have running while playing ( that eats up resources )? In steams case how fast is your net connection? and have you tried game boosters?\nThe number one thing I have come across over the years of the Internet is that people don't know how to properly clean thier computers. Computers I have come across have stuff running in the background and stuff you are unaware of that is distroying your system / internets performance. Along with programs running that are not needed during play.\n\nMy ram ( 4 gigs ) runs with nothing open ( idle) at 13% and cpu is 0-5% right now having steams client open to do this review my ram is at 22% and cpu is 13% when I launch FSX either boxed or steam my ram goes to 44-56% and cpu 50-85% depending on what  graphics are loading. Without a game booster.\n\nPlease don't take all that as being a smart butt or anything just trying to give people ideas of what could cause their issues. And I'm sure there will be people saying I'm wrong but we all have our opinion and experence.\n\nHope my opinions and comments help people out.\nI give FSX - Steam 4 out of 5 stars after 22.9 hours played","February 20, 2015","true","35.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This version seems slightly more optimized. For a simulator released in 2006, it still looks pretty amazing on the highest settings. This is a great simulator for those who want to start learning the basics of flight and maybe some slightly more advanced stuff. However, me being more experienced in aircraft flight, the controls in each of the aircraft are far too basic. Not enough controls for me to simulate a full on flight but to fix that, all i needed to do was buy a few aircraft from seperate developers for a more realistic and fun flying experience. There are some really good ones out there but no good free ones. Anyway, great simualtor, and for the price, you really can't go wrong.

FSX: Steam Edition does not include a developer SDK and the focus for this release is to provide players with a stable standalone simulator which utilises the advantages of the Steam platform. If you wish to use the SDK it remains available in the boxed edition of FSX and all functionality will continue to work as it did prior to the release of FSX: Steam Edition. There are no plans to introduce a SDK to the Steam edition at this time.\n*****************************************************************************************************************\n\nThe gold edition relaunch on steam after Gamespy got down. New desing on the launcher, steam friends showing on there. Multiplayer is good, it doesnt eat much connection, and does the job on GSM networking too. Ability to play as ATC or Pilot in multiplay is good plus. The King of Flight Simulation has gotten up from the grave, and is back bigger and much more evil than it was with addons, and works fine with old free software like PAX and other addons.\n\nSimulation is easy to understand, everybody can learn to fly a 747, or even little Cessna in no time!\n\nGraphics are not HQ++++ but there are not many Flight Simulations that can do even that without eating your graphics card alive, or heating your CPU over 1000C. FSX was success, and hopefully this re-release of FSX wakes Microsoft studios to new era.\n\nOnly minus i give this game is the ability to play offline is not yet implemented, but becouse there are no CD-keys anymore, i understand this.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n- ED","February 11, 2015","true","31.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

FSX: Steam Edition does not include a developer SDK and the focus for this release is to provide players with a stable standalone simulator which utilises the advantages of the Steam platform. If you wish to use the SDK it remains available in the boxed edition of FSX and all functionality will continue to work as it did prior to the release of FSX: Steam Edition. There are no plans to introduce a SDK to the Steam edition at this time.\n*****************************************************************************************************************\n\nThe gold edition relaunch on steam after Gamespy got down. New desing on the launcher, steam friends showing on there. Multiplayer is good, it doesnt eat much connection, and does the job on GSM networking too. Ability to play as ATC or Pilot in multiplay is good plus. The King of Flight Simulation has gotten up from the grave, and is back bigger and much more evil than it was with addons, and works fine with old free software like PAX and other addons.\n\nSimulation is easy to understand, everybody can learn to fly a 747, or even little Cessna in no time!\n\nGraphics are not HQ++++ but there are not many Flight Simulations that can do even that without eating your graphics card alive, or heating your CPU over 1000C. FSX was success, and hopefully this re-release of FSX wakes Microsoft studios to new era.\n\nOnly minus i give this game is the ability to play offline is not yet implemented, but becouse there are no CD-keys anymore, i understand this.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n- ED","February 11, 2015","true","31.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

BUT...without any of the down sides! FPS is severely improved (about an 11 fps improvement ) from the original FSX, multiplayer is back (not many servers at the moment) which is obviously a good thing, there are already some really good servers with ATC's as well as pilots all working together and the outcome is an amazingly immersive flight sim experience.\n\nIt is REX (real environment extreme) compatible and from what I understand most of the other FSX add-ons (planes, scenery and software) are also compatible. The massive frame dip that used to happen whenever rain was implemented in the sim has been scaled down quite a bit. It is still there but it’s now only about a 5-8 FPS dip but the game is still very playable and on higher end systems the dip will make no difference at all.\nThe game has been re-worked so that it is more compatible with multi-core systems and high end graphics cards.

I have purchased just about every MS FS version since the Commodore 128 days.  I would purchase each new version hoping for the best, but I would never play it after installing it.  It never ran smooth enough thoughout the years for me to enjoy it.

I spent the last month trying to do so.  All the reading...reinstallations...everything seemed to go wrong.  Then a few days ago, I was able to configure a stable running game.  It has all been worth it.\n\nThis game has the backing of people/players each with over 6 years of experience and dedication to the FSX community.  Almost all the issues I ran into have already been addressed and the solutions posted on the web somewhere.  It's just a matter of searching on the web for suggested solutions to almost any problem.

I laughed at the joke that was Microsoft Flight, and continued pouring countless hours and thousands of dollars into my humble hobby.. the came the announcement that Dovetail would be picking up the rights to sell FSX and it would be released on Steam...  at first, I thought "well that is nice, maybe this thing isn't going to die after all."  And so I have taken the plunge, and bought Steam Edition.. well, right off the word go, it was a hassle installing it beside my original boxed edition of the game, and so I went ahead and uninstalled the boxed edition, as I have my enormous library of add-ons stretched across 3 hard drives, and would have little to do i the way of reinstalling most of it, beyond some scenery library recompiles, and a couple of the payware aircraft with touchy DRM that would need fresh installs...  Here is where the trouble began... When FSX:SE runs, it is wonderfullyt smooth, and has little impact on my machine, exerting a modest 40-60% load on my CPU and 20-35% on the GPU and gracing me with 50-70FPS frame rates, but that is where the fun stops.. in the past week I have made a grand total of 2, yes just 2 landing.. out of 327 takeoffs at the time of this writing, the game has managed not to crash during a flight a grand total of TWICE.. now to give Dovetail a little credit, I have not contacted them directly for support, but in the discussion boards here are some very well known and respected developers in the 3rd party add-on community, and if they don't have answers (as it would professionally be in their interest, as well as Dovetail's) then Dovetail doesn't have answers either.. the 3rd Party add-ons are what made this franchise sustainable, and is the only thing that will keep it going, and if this game cannot currently run 3rd party add-ons without terrain.dll crashes and R6025 runtime errors then I think I'm going to have to go back to the boxed edition for a while...  I can only hope that Dovetail finds and corrects the problems quickly, but frankly this is an even worse release than the Battlefield 4 debacle from Electronic Arts.. Do I still recommend the game? Yes, as it is still the King of home based flight simulators.. but am I enthusiastic about it? no, not with the game as it currently stands, and hopefully Dovetailwill do a couple things: first of all, communicate with their customers.. all the rage on the discussion forums about the game not working will only scare potential customers away, so even if you have nothing to report, saying so makes it know that you do actually have a presence and are indeed working on it (especially important while people are screaming that the game doesn't work while you are still cranking out DLC titles), and second of all, communicate and work with the developers to find solutions.. just because you can't seem to figure out what is causing the crashes, maybe by giving the developer community an idea as to what you're looking at, they can find the solution in the process of making their products work on your platform..  this isn't a AAA release, the secrecy and cloak  & dagger nonsense isn't going to help anyone...","January 26, 2015","true","223.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Thumbs up for keeping the game alive after all these years and support it for new OS.\nAbout the game, the simulator out of the box, let's face it, is crap! without the serious addons such as PMDG, Vatsim, Orbx, ... etc the game is rated poor to mediocre and only targeting casual players. There is no actual complete simulation of Airbus and Boeing airplanes, you can't touch the overhead panel of the cockpit to play around with the butons to xfeed the fuel, shutdown damaged hydrolic pumps or extinguish the engine fire using the firing system. Nothing! you only control the navigation and couple of radios. The weather system is obsolete, the textures are old, the mesh is so low poly.\n\nDovetail didn't understand how important addons are, they are only planning for kids missions of simple features and ignoring the players request to support the existing addons that kept the game alive for 8 years. You hardly find a FSX pilot using such old texture or simple airplanes unless he really doesn't care about playing the game.\n\nOn the other hand, the addon developers such as PMDG and Aerosoft don't realize the potential of steam. They don't realize how steam is powerful in advertisment, promoting software and increase sales. They simply ignore actual integration by publishing their software as DLCs. Why are they expecting new players to figure out that there are cool addons if they can't be found on steam? A big question mark! The good addons are EUR70+ which is expensive not because they are really good and complicated but simply because they only target very few players. Using steam, they will target millions and the price will have to be reduced. A win win.\n\nIt is a big mess. Both parties are only targeting the few thousands of loyal virtual pilots and missing the big picture of attracting millions of new players and make them more interested in buy this simulator.\nI'm not their marketing consultant but, I assume that eventually this lovely game will fade away in a couple of years. They have to reset their Barometer and pitch the nose up :)\n\nUntil they sort it out, try to Google for FSX addons and you will realize how big FS universe is.","January 27, 2015","true","78.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I already owned FSX and FSX accelleration for some years. I wanted to see for my self if it was true what Steam wrote about the performance of the re-compiled FSX for Steam Edition. Until now I am very positive about the performance of FSX-SE. I also installed various add-on aircraft which I bought before for FSX and also "Mega Airport Lisbon 2008" scenery for FSX that I bought more than a year ago from Aerosoft. After following some good advices on Steam community as well as on internet, I now have these add-ons as well as FSUIPC4 and IVAO Ivap modules "up and running" within FSX-SE. I run FSX-SE in Windowed mode because I use three monitors. The middle monitor is in use for FSX-SE. The left for Navigation charts (usually within the Navigraph Maps app). On the monitor on the right I have usually Flightsim Commander (9.6) and Google Chrome Webbrowser with the IVAO WebEye page. Since XMAS 2014 I have flown various hours online on IVAO without any crashes of the apps. Before, when using MS FSX I had problems with frequent crashes of FSX and/or add-ons. All together: I am very satisfied with FSX Steam Edition. I recommand FSX Steam Edition it to you as I experienced it as a good maintenance version of FSX. I hope that Steam will go on for long time supporting and expanding FSX for Steam Edition. I don't know if I am able to but I want to upload some screenshots I made from an online flight with FSX-SE that I made yesterday.

FPS is severely improved (about an 11 fps improvement ) from the original FSX, multiplayer is back (not many servers at the moment) which is obviously a good thing, there are already some really good servers with ATC's as well as pilots all working together and the outcome is an amazingly immersive flight sim experience.\n\nIt is REX (real environment extreme) compatible and from what I understand most of the other FSX add-ons (planes, scenery and software) are also compatible. The massive frame dip that used to happen whenever rain was implemented in the sim has been scaled down quite a bit. It is still there but it’s now only about a 5-8 FPS dip but the game is still very playable and on higher end systems the dip will make no difference at all.\nThe game has been re-worked so that it is more compatible with multi-core systems and high end graphics cards.

Why can no sim get this simple concept correct?  I have 6 monitors... 3 for scenery and 3 for the full cockpit dashboard.let us assign the screens and keep them that way every time we start the darned game!!!!\n\nEDIT 1: so I played around with it for longer.  The screens are still hard to get working right.  The DLC is too expensive. .... otherwise it's not so bad.  I still have not played with the ATC sim part or online play but the current issues with immersion are more important than playing with ATC controllers that may or may not know protocols.  Stay tuned.\n\nEDIT 2: Holy Mega-charge DLC! There's already 19 expansion packs all at asinine prices. Such a shame Microsoft sold this to such a POS company. I could see if expansions were a few dollars each or so, or had bundles... if you want to know where this game is headed just check out train simulator... hundreds of DLC's for about $4000+ USD. All for crappy content (but the only content that will work right in this buggy platform.) Don;t support this company, please.

VATSIM has become much easier, yet more intense at the same time as you learn what different systems do. Its no longer get from A to B, it's get to A to B with passenger comfort or cargo undamaged in the process. Plotting your route more precise with waypoints as you get better, not just direct. It becomes more and more real the longer you play. I cannot reccommend another game as much as I do FSX.","May 4, 2015","true","344.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However there are plently of various add ons that change that. Since buying this I have bought several add ons and though some are a tad expensive, the change to the sim are worth it.\n\nThere is quite a steep learning curve, especially if you decide to get one of the advanced aircraft. But its had to beat nailing a landing in bad weather :)\n\nThe only downside to it is the fact that its showing its age and cannot use modern PC's to the full. I have had several instances of "Out of memory" errors when trying to run everything on "High". Other than that, if you like flight sims and you dont mind a challenge, go for it.\n\nAdd ons\n-PMDG 737 NGX\n-PMDG 777\n-Aerosoft Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321\n-Alabeo DA42 TS\n-Carenado Phenom 100\n-Active Sky Next\n-ORBX Global\n-ORBX NI, England, Ireland\n-Uk 2000 Belfast Int, Heathrow, Manchester, Edinburgh, Luton, Jersey, Gatwick\n-Fly Tampa Dubai\n-Taxi2Gate Munich\n-Precipit FX (PMDG 737)\n-737 Immersion\n-Rex 4 Texture Direct with Soft Clouds\n-GSX\n-EzDok\n-FS2Crew (PMDG 737)","November 2, 2015","true","554.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I've been flying IFR from Adelaide, in RT. 737. My RT weather add-on throws up storms, heavy turbulence. My scenery add-on shows a beautiful Sydney in the distance, glimpsed through the heavy cloud. The take-off was simple, the AP locked on GPS track and the job is nearly done. I've been descending for a while, saving fuel... you know how it goes.\n\nI'm loving it. Calm. Controlled. Content.\n\nOut of the misty depth of somewhere between 9000 and 10000 I'm asked to turn left on 300 and descend and maintain 6000. I dial it in, acknowledge.  Easier to disengage AP now. We're nearly home.\n\nSuddenly. "TRAFFIC ALERT". An A320 is 12.00 o'clock 4 miles at 10000. Can I see him? No. Where?\n\nSorry tower, no sight. No. Look, there he is. Flying above me. Phew. Sorted.\n\nSorry. Were you talking to me? Turn left on 340, descend and maintain 4000? OK. Doing it now....\n\n(This turbulence. It's killing me.  Maybe I should go back on AP?)\n\nSorry tower. Climb and maintain 6000?! What? Oh wait. I thought you said 4000? Oh... That wasn't me. I'm Sierra TANGO, not Sierra ROMEO. Ahhh... Climbing back to 6000, trying to smooth out the heading.\n\nSorry. What was that? TRAFFIC ALERT. Again!! What sort of ATC are you?! 3 o'clock, 2 miles, 4500. Altitude check. 4500. Oh Oh! Collision course.... My life starts flashing before my eyes then I realise it was the Piper's strobe as he flies just feet in front of me. Phew.\n\nSorry. Sierra TANGO. (Hey that\s me). I'm 500 below my assigned. Ahh.. What?? That's right. I'm supposed to be 6000. Check heading. 270?? I'm heading to Perth. Dammit. I need to sort the heading too!\n\nClimbing.... Turning..... Climbing.....\n\nWHAT'S THAT DAMN NOISE!!! Sink rate? What sink rate?!! GS is below 120. Head wind? Oh. Oh..... I drop the nose instinctively as I grab the throttle and ram them home. 130, 150, 170..... I knew I watched those airplane movies for a reason.\n\nSorry tower. What? I'm 3000 below assigned. Yeah. Too bad. I'm busy.\n\nPull up. Pull up. Pull u..........................\n\nIt was then I realised that commercial heavy pilots don't get paid for 100% of their time.

No. The only thing that has changed is the fact that you can run FSX from Steam. The Main Menu hasnt changed in looks since it first came out in October 2006. It's 2015. Im suprised Microsoft hasnt come out with a new Flight Simulator with better graphics, planes, missions. etc.\n\nI grew up playing Microsoft Flight Simulator 98, 04, X, and this Steam edition was a bit of let down. Now, I understand that this is still the Flight Simulator X that came out years ago just now available on Steam, but I was hoping there would be some type of workshop or a better layout of the game.\n\nOverall, I am a little dissapointed. I essentially re-bought FSX. IF Microsoft created a Flight Simulator 2015(2016), I would by it the week it would come out!\n\nAgain, its a classic game, but very dissapointed.","February 1, 2015","false","3.0"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","8","17","2","2"

Every time you launch into a game, no matter what you do, you will always get "A Fatal Error has occured" and the game will restart. It's absurd. In addition to that, its also incredibly difficult to fly a plane without a joystick. Your plane doesn't respond well to any sort of keyboard controls.","January 1, 2015","false","0.4"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","1"

Will not run smoothly at any framerate on any system, not even a smooth 30fps is achievable on a high end system due to the horribly unoptimized engine.   afaict, the game uses too much CPU, since the GPU usage never gets over 20%, and the CPU is working at ~80%.   I've tried everything, even with minimum graphic settings it's still a stutterfest.   I don't know why the CPU has to work so hard.  Even when you are rendering 60fps there is still a constant hitching and stuttering as the CPU loads more scenery.  Tried chaging CPU affinity, radeonpro vsync, triple buffering, flip queue size, fps cap, fsx.cfg FIBER_FRAME_TIME_FRACTION, nothing works.     The graphics are broken.   If it ran smooth, at least 30fps with good frame pacing, it would be great.    But it doesn't, so it's a horrible experience.     Disappointed.\n\nUpdate:  I have found some settings that produce a playable result on my [current gen] system (see comments).","February 3, 2015","false","45.2"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","7","15","2","3"

Its very disapointing, many of the cockpit instruments do not load, the menu at the top of the screen when you try to access the map for instance, you just get a black screen which does not go away until i tap the escape key. So all in all its a waste of money.","December 22, 2015","false","39.3"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","6","13","2","3"

Having played a mere 2 hours of this, I've found issues with:\n\n- Launching the game (crashed on launch).\n- Optimisation (any game where I have to manually go into the .ini and change settings to increase performance is a negative point for me)\n- Graphics (I don't care much for graphics, I still play the original DOOM) are substandard. That includes everything from scenary to cockpit models. I even tried installing a few graphical mods which barely improved the visual experience.\n- Flight Models (Having come from DCS, I notice a huge difference in how the aircraft performs.. It feels very arcadey)\n- Cockpit Fidelity (Half the buttons and switches in the cockpits aren't toggleable)\n\nI realise this is a 2006 game and perhaps I'm expecting too much from it. The initial 2 hours I've played have put me off completely, after I was initially hyped to begin playing. Whilst I paid considerably less than £19.99, I still can't recommend anybody buying this.\n","April 29","false","1.3"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"
