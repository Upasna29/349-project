Choppy, not smooth GUI, and storyline is pretty linear.  I understand it is a translated game, perhaps from France, but I couldn't help but feel like it was a shined up Sega Genesis title, just without the fun.\n\nI did buy it on sale, and did finish it.  I love puzzle games, but would recommend looking elsewhere for a good puzzler.","October 17, 2014","false","3.7"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","25","32","0","0"

Well, that's in general most of the story that is to this game.\n\nAs player you can just be glad and happy it has no achievements, since this game is - well not exactly bad, but it also isn't a very good game of the genre - there are some riddles and puzzles that can give you quite the headache. I like hard puzzles, I like games where all isn't quite obvious - but I also like a barrier-free gaming experience. This isn't given all the time on that game.\n\nThe game is missing a lot of stuff, professional voice acting is non existent and the story is very rudimentary developed and highly illogical at times...\n\nPro:Good to excelent graphics.Nice and stylish soundtrack.Some inovative riddles.Con:The story isn't logical and sometimes it's outright a mess.The game is sometimes unclear about the directions and steps required to solve a given riddle, partially this is frustrating and you might give it to the overburdened scenes.No Voiceacting.Sometimes too restrictive in the placing of objects, which also might get on your nerves if you have to retry placing something half a dozen times... Far too expensive.\nNot Recommended\nGiven some of the graphics in this game are outright excelent, especially some of the scenes for the hidden objects, the game in itself is a lot of frustration and the story itself is cheesy - if you want to call it this way. The price is also a big minus and if it hasn't been in a bundle I probably wouldn't have bothered. You can call yourself lucky this game has no achievements, you would be forced to run through a game that's mostly time and money robbery - oh... That reminds me on the Title... Black Viper is a thief, isn't she? At least she wasn't able to steal my heart.","August 25, 2015","false","1.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

At first I thought it was going to be annoying to change from a device to another (this is the first time I play an HO game on a computer) but I was pleasantly suprised in the end. The interface on PC is quite fluid.\n\nSpeaking about the game itself, it is a very good HO indeed, the environements and graphisms are very detailed and beautiful. The interface of the game is very original and totally different from what you can usually find in HO Games. For example the Hint Button is displayed as a gun barrel with limited amunitions that shoots the screen to show you the way whenever you use it, the mouse pointer has a good design and many other little things like the system implemented to prevent the players overclicking the screen to find the items that will make your pointer turn mad (exploding, looping everywhere...). Very entertaining.\n\nThe plot itself is quite interesting and the narrative of the story has a good consistence and coherence.\nAlso many scene are already culte to me like the one is the dungeon because again they are quite unusual.\n\nIf you want a good original HO play this game and make your own opinion. I personnaly recommand this game to all the HO and casual games lovers.","November 19, 2014","true","0.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Who really started at the roots, because this game feels like something from 2006: no voice acting, cut-scenes consisting of character portraits talking, and archaic hidden object mechanics.\nAlso, the hint function is broken and tends to lead the player around in circles (it works in the HO scenes though).\n\nIs the story good at least? No, it’s astonishingly bad, a mixture of low-budget spy movies and a female version of Danger: Diabolik. On the plus side, we have everything: a secret Egyptian sect plotting world domination, technical-looking gadgets everywhere (including roof-mounted laser cannons on the police station!), a predictable plot, clichéd characters, and even some horrible dialogues.\nBut it’s so incredibly terrible it’s hilarious; Black Viper is a prime example of the “so bad it is good” category. Thankfully the game is short, so if you ever need some cheesy spy story to laugh at, get it.","April 23, 2015","true","3.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

No voice acting, and it's riddled with spelling and grammar errors in the on-screen text.  The game suffered game-breaking glitches making it unplayable twice; the first about 15% of the way through the game and I restarted with a new game.  But the second glitch happened about 95% of the way through the game, depriving me of the ending and being able to finish the game.  In general, the game was so bad there was no way I was going to restart it yet again.  The plot wavers between cliched, nonsensical, and barely existent.  And most of the gameplay involves the player trying to figure out what it is they're supposed to be doing as a result of bad gameplay design and clunky gameplay mechanisms.  If you're looking for a decent hidden object game, go grab one by Artifex Mundi.  I'm rating this game 1/10.","November 3, 2014","false","5.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

One issue I did find was sometimes the hint system fails you and just has you shuffling from room to room without actually helping you work out the next step, but usually it does work correctly, but it did lead me to use a walkthrough in one section where I couldn't work out what to do and the hint system broke down in this way.\n\nIn terms of the story and characters, the story starts out okay but does get a bit silly - it seems very much aimed to be like a B-movie, but some of the developments at later stages get pretty weird and out of place compared to the tone for the first half of the game. While Sophia herself is actually a little interesting as a character, most of the rest of the game is populated by very one dimensional cliches - the businesslike police boss, the rich playboy, etc.\n\nOverall then a decent HOG with a few flaws, but also a bit different from the standard for the genre, with a decent if somewhat strange storyline.","August 31, 2015","true","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story is interesting but I feel that more should have been developped. The hidden objects scenes are good but some items are hard to see. Good thing is that you can zoom in or zoom out. And some voice actings could have been good too.\n\nAnyway, I'm kinda frustrated by that game, despite the good visuals, the good plot and the music. I only recommend it for the hardcore HOG gamers. For the others, I recommend any Artifex Mundi game or the classics like Mystery P.I. (though it's pure HOG), Samantha Swift or Mystery Cases Files.","January 2, 2015","false","3.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strifeypoo/recommended/322990/","strifeypoo","strifekun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strifeypoo/","1258 products in account","I'm going to say this flat out. I do not recommend this game. Game mechanics were a bit iffy - the puzzles and hidden object scenes works just fine, but progressing was slightly difficult as it was hard to know what to do or what you could pick up. And while nobody over the age of thirteen plays hidden object games for their story, it was a bit dumb.\n\nThe biggest problem I had was with text. Or with the way the text was written. Considering that hidden object games rely massively on text for their stories, they should be well written with decent grammar. You will not find that here. I feel that this is mainly because this game was made in another country in a different language, then was translated into English. But the person translating English does not know English well enough to translate correctly - so often there are words that don't make sense (too literal or a phrase translated literally). And because of this, there are a few items in the hidden object scenes that were difficult to find because you aren't exactly sure what you are looking for ('pocket' for example was a purse type object).\n\nSo in conclusion - this game was a bit of a bore and a bit frustrating. The badly translated text was too distracting to derive enjoyment from it - detracting from the story. If you must, buy this in a bundle or on sale.","December 20, 2014","false","2.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
