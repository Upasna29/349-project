Considering the vast minefield of overpriced, underdeveloped trash floating around Steam's bargain bin, a game like this could easily fit into the more expensive end of the 'Under $10' bracket.\n---\nThe graphics are...basic, but pleasant. The gameplay is like the original Prince of Persia, if the prince didn't handle like a waterlogged Nash Rambler. The environments and story are immersive enough to be engaging; vague enough to be mysterious. The puzzles can be infuriating for just long enough to stay interesting, until epiphany strikes to leave you (well, me, at least) feeling brilliant and stupid in equal measure. Some of the background art is staggering in its implication, and - hey! - you can even take photos to remember it.\n\nAt the end of the day (or, rather, the end of the first hour I played), Saira strikes me as a hybrid of Myst and Braid, with some Tomb Raider mantling and wall-runs tossed in just for funsies.\n\nGive me more...please? I might even pay for the sequel...","November 22, 2014","true","1.2"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","30","33","5","2"

It may not be awesome and could feel somewhat like a game you'd play for free on any website (but, hey, it's free on Steam, too), but it's above average. If you like those genres, it's definitely worth checking! Again, it's free! ^_^\n\nPros:\nNice balance between puzzle, platform and exploration--each part nice in its way\nIt's free!\nBGM is good and you may even change the radio station when travelling\nMultiple endings\nEven has a decent story going on\nCons:\nShould have controller support\nMany of the items you get are useless for the true ending\nAlthough it has some charm, its graphics are a tad bit too simplistic for me\nWaiting to move from one planet to the other doesn't make any sense\nThe pinball minigame they have available for you to play while waiting is meh\nBought on / for: The developer decided they were done making money with Saira, so it's now FREE on Steam. And I'd still buy it if I knew how the game was. If you also liked it, you could also buy their other games, like Knytt Underground and support them (still haven't played it, but already own it). The least I can do is recommend it to you guys and share their website[nifflas.ni2.se].","August 27, 2014","true","3.8"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","29","36","0","0"

Or I thought so at least. Definitely little though, but not too disappointingly so.\nThe platforming is really fun and smooth though, and can get pretty challenging at times, though not extremely so. And there's plenty of diversity, usually each planet has a different gimmick and often it's necessary to revisit areas in the same sector multiple times, since there's some minor puzzle elements involved.\nThe graphics are alright but not a huge factor of the game. The plot is kind of non-existent save for the intro and ending(s).\nWorth checking out though I'd say, but probably on sale.","March 1, 2014","true","6.6"," 26 of 37 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","26","37","0","0"

It would be highly recommended, BUT if tricky puzzles easily frustrate you, or if you're not into platformers with hard to reach places then you probably wont enjoy it very much. I still recommend the game.\n\nIt's completely free and the developers cared enough about their work to create a beautiful platformer with tight controls and a fitting soundtrack, so you should try it. Higher degree of difficulty will please some and put off others.\n\nLack of in-game volume controls is a ridiculous oversight, but otherwise the game is without fault.\n\n","October 11, 2014","true","2.3"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

Love the puzzles and how they combined with the platforming sections. The artstyle is a blend between a lot of stuff, but there's something personal and scrapbooky about it. The biggest draw to this game is the atmosphere, the music doesn't interrupt the ambiance too much and compliments it rather well. Traveling between planets while reading about them with the radio in the background gives a comfy feel to the game. If you liked the movie Interstellar you'll enjoy this game.\n\nSome Concerns:\n\nI think the photography mechanic could have been utilized more as it's pretty much a substitute for player memory. It's appreciated but I thought the game would be based around it some how.\n\nThe battery/travel between planets didn't seem to add much other than give reason as to why you can't bounce between stars. If expanded upon a little more it could have been an interesting survival mechanic. But really I guess it's hard to design something like that along with such a fixed platforming puzzler.\n\nDon't let these complaints detriment the game though, they're more or less things I noticed that could have been different.","June 23, 2015","true","6.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonesr/recommended/48900/","jonesr","JonesR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonesr/","1280 products in account","Saira is a wall-jumping puzzle platformer that offers a variety of different game elements, environments, and puzzle diversity. The story revolves around a teleportation gone wrong and an effort to make things right again. There are several different planets to explore, and travel between systems is anything but conventional. It makes for an entertaining trip, but before you can travel, the ships battery has to be charged up so get out there and explore planets, solve those pesky puzzles, and gather items to fix the teleporter to get back home.\n\nI bought the game a while back before it became free to play. I struggled with it the first time as it is not a "hold your hand" type of puzzle game, but after coming back to it, I was able to figure out all the pieces I was missing. Saira is worth more than the free price tag for sure.","February 3","true","9.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Saira has a few bugs with some graphics drivers and some resolution issues but they are tolerable, and I myself never had any crashing or other issues, though many folks who have played have had these above described issues.\n\nStory wise Saira tells an interesting tale of teleportation gone wrong, is it timetravel, was it some type of natural disaster, what happened to the other humans? These are some of the questions you will ask yourself on your journy to fix up your ship and teleporter across the galaxy.\n\nOverall though Saira offers a good deal of platformer and puzzle gameplay, there are multiple ending aswell though I haven ot experienced all of them. I recommend Saira to anyone looking for a free indie, platformer of puzzle game.","September 8, 2014","true","5.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It's a puzzle platformer, but it actually manages to do something new. You have to take pictures (with passwords, or to identity creatures for example), find items and hack stuff. And of course, you have to run, jump and fly like prety much all platformers out there.\nThe animations are fluid and it looks pretty cool (but basic). The controls are terrible though, I can't get used to them. I keep pressing them in random order to see what they do. I can't get the hang of it.

The platforming has a few tricks to it, but there are lots of save points. Platforming veterans shouldn't have too much trouble, but it may take some time for the uninitiated to get through the challenges. The adventure aspect was pretty fun, and the game really allows you to explore the locations in any order. The puzzles were tricky. I was able to get through it without consulting a walkthrough, but some of them are decently difficult. For the quiz puzzle, I figured out four of the answers and guessed on the other three until it let me through.\n\nThe game supports multiple "episodes", but only comes with one. It took me about 4 hours to complete.\n\nI thought Saira was pretty fun, and it was worth my time.

You wander around planets hoping you photographed things you then use to solve puzzles.

You have to go in a specific order and collect things and its just no intuitive. Platforming is good but its more about randomly exploring planets with an intangible purpose. Most of the time you don't have any idea exactly where to go or what to do. I prefer to not wander around aimlessly, although so many derps call that "atmosphere, and beauty". I call it dumb.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/48900/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1772 products in account","At first glance, Saira looks and in fact is, a very cheap Flash game. You will not be able to adjust any settings at all, such as the volume, and the game takes up a relatively small part of the screen. Needless to say, there are large black borders surrounding the viewable game area. The graphical style also manages to have an overly simple and cheap look, which also goes along with an overall cut-rate presentation and production. The jumping and platforming elements also appear to be designed poorly, as timing the jumps can often be awkward and unusually rough. Despite these limitations, Saira does offer the player some mildly interesting and basic interactions with the game world. As you travel to different planets to collect various objects for your project, you discover other life forms, as well as different machines that you must interact with throughout your quest. While the initial puzzles are favorable and intuitive, they will quickly become boring, annoying, repetitive, pointless, and severely lacking in creativity as you progress through the planets. The game's protagonist must put a photo camera to use in order to remember mundane puzzle hints, as well as use other gadgets in each planet. While inside the ship, one has access to a few other screens which allows for a poorly designed pinball mini game, and a radio receiver of sorts, that advertises musicians and their Myspace page links. Everything about Saira screams low production values and very poor execution. While it is true that the idea behind the game is quite interesting and promising, it is obvious that the development talent is simply not up to the task, as there is a clear gap between the concept and accomplishment. With poor showings such as NightSky and Saira, the developer has proven that the necessary skills in order to create appropriate games is severely lacking, and one can only hope that this improves over time. If all of these faults were not enough, it is also important to mention that this bore is prone to random crashing as well. The asking price is also something to be ashamed of. Saira is yet another good example of what limited game design and poor implementation is, and what should be avoided in the future. It is the epitome of what independent game development should not be like. Perhaps if it were freeware, it would be more suitable.\n\nSaira is mediocre.","March 20, 2014","false","1.3"," 10 of 33 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","10","33","0","0"

The use of photography as a gimmick for solving puzzles is substantially more fun than you would expect, the puzzles that don't involve it are traditional but still entertaining fare, and the core platforming is very solid.  There's also very good music, both in the ambient stuff you'd expect from a Nifflas game and some interesting funk and rock on the ship radio.\n\nConsidering it's $10 tops (and like $5 or less on a sale day) you've got no excuse not to buy this.","May 16, 2013","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mallowy/recommended/48900/","Mallowy","Slime Drips","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mallowy/","256 products in account","Saira is a game I've been waiting to play for years since I don't really have a ton of money for games and it never went on sale. Was very surprising when it mysteriously showed up as free one day!\n\nLike many of Nifflas' other games (Within a Deep Forest, the Knytt Series, etc) Saira is a chill puzzle/platformer/exploration game where you walk around (usually) relaxing environments whilst jumping around and solving puzzles to collect items.\n\nSometimes the puzzles or platforming can feel a bit more difficult than I'd like, but for the most part I found everything very easily doable after a few tries (the terminals puzzle in the tech-like area were awful though, IMO). Some platforming segments can feel a bit more demanding than they are though, specifically the ones that require the flying ability as the timer for the ability running out feels shorter than it actually is.\n\nThere's also two traits it shares with the Knytt series that I feel are worth mentioning. First, the game stars a female character who I assume is not white, and despite the story revolving around trying to rescue a male friend, lacks any real implied romanticism, both of which are hugely welcomed changes from the typical "white dude does things and falls in love with girls" type stuff I'm used to seeing. Second, the game is non-combative and low violence, giving the player no means of attacking and having the only real "violence" be caused by falling into harmful liquids or touching dangerous fauna, which give a very toned-down death screen. On those notes, it's probably pretty kid-friendly, didn't think about that until just now.\n\nAs for length, it took me 5 hours to 100% it. It's not an extremely long game, but I'm happy with its content.\n\nAll in all Saira is a very nice chill game with calming music and visuals, though as I said, its sometimes not as chill as I'd like due to mild puzzle and platformer frustration.\n\nIt's fun, it's chill, it's different, it's worth a try.","December 1, 2014","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
