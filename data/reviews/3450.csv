Deluxe is a fun game. Diving to shipwrecks in order to find valuable treasures (and fending off hungry sealife by electro shocks generated from vicious typing) becomes repetitive after a while, but it is definitely one of the more fun ways of learning how to touchtype.\n\nThe problem I have with Typer Shark is the fact that it can't be properly shut down. It will run on in the background and log more and more time, unless you reboot the computer. That is a bit annoying, and it would be really nice if that would be gotten rid of in a future update (though I suppose this won't really happen).\n\nSince I don't feel like I can learn much more from this game, I will clock it as "played through" and turn towards other games.","February 13, 2015","true","0.8"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

I believe it's on the iTunes as well, as well as other web-based game sites. When I installed it on my Win7 32-bit core 2 duo, it couldn't find the executable file. I checked the forums & "TomAtTardis" said to install the demo also & it worked. It works fine otherwise, it's a good, fun, cheap game to work on your typing with about 5 difficulty choices & bosses at the end of each stage. When I tried to exit Steam, it wouldn't let me saying Typing Shark was still running though I had seemed to exit normal & played other Steam games. I checked the task manager & lo & behold, Popcap Typer shark was still running under the processes, though not showing as running as an application.","June 26, 2014","true","1.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It really does stretch your typing skills by giving you multiple challenges to work with. It will test you and push you to type faster and more accurate then you thought possible. It can be frustrating at times to get all the words on the screen but with practice you can type really fast with this game. It has a story mode were you try to get diamonds. You will get attacked by Sharks and other fish of the ocean which makes it fun to attack all the fish, you will be challenged with single letters and whole words.
