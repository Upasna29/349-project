I bought it as part of the 3d Realms anthology. A set of classics that are mostly excellent (though some have already been released like Raptor and Shadow Warrior Classic).\n\nRealm of Chaos had good graphics for a game of its time and was well advanced for a game of its time. A nice smooth scrolling platformer game. The sounds are expected of a game of its time, but the graphics are very nice. The game play is pretty straightforward.\n\nThis is definitely a game for nostaglia.\n\nThanks for re-releasing it!","September 7, 2015","true","0.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

The game feels great and works great in everything. It looks good, the soundtrack is good, controls work very well, combat is very fun and the game is quite challenging. The five difficulties grant the game a highly variable challenge level - they don't just change how much health the characters have or how many gems you get, but they also slightly change the layout for some levels. The last difficulty level even adds auto screen scrolling to some levels that normally don't have it, forcing players to be on their toes even on some levels where they'd normally be able to take their time with.\n\nThe only things I didn't enjoy too much about this game is that the episode 2 final boss is way too hard in comparison to the rest of the game and the ending is quite lackluster.\n\nAn incredibly awesome game, definitely recommended.","December 18, 2015","true","3.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

The graphics are great, the music sounds adventurous, and the level design is amazing. Another grand addition for the Apogee Anthology. It would be hard to not recommend this game for retro gamers.","November 2, 2015","true","0.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you like pixel art, this has got tons of it, plus MIDI music. Whats not to like?","January 24","true","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So you collect gems for the girl and swap between the guy and the girl, depending on whether you need melee or range attacks. This game involves platforming and killing enemies to progress. That's about it.\n\n","March 11","false","0.2"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Sure, the game is from 1995, but even then it didn't get great reviews.\n\nI had absolutely no fun in this game.","January 14","false","0.3"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","23","3","13","0","0"
