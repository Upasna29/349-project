While at this point the Tetrobot is the most popular and best robot around, it is not immune to problems. The Psychobot’s job is to go into Tetrobot and fix whatever problems my lay inside.\n\nSo what exactly do you do in this game? Well, you move blocks. Blocks that matter, to be specific. The game follows an extremely similar style of logic and mechanics that Blocks that Matter does, since they both play out in the same universe. The goal is to maneuver throughout the Tetrobot, finding as many pieces of memory that you can along with getting to the end. Unlike the puzzle platformer style of game play the previous game had, this plays more like it is on a  grid. The Psychobot flies through Tetrobots to wherever it needs to be.\n\nFixing a Tetrobot isn’t easy, though. It is actually quite the puzzle, as they get a lot of blocks clogged up into their system. You have to manipulate these blocks so that you can continue on through certain passage ways and areas. Blocks connect to blocks of the same matter. So stone will connect to stone, wood will connect to wood, and so on.  Knowing how to correctly stack blocks will be very helpful for maneuvering through these levels.\n\nIt is never hard to relax and play this game. Everything about the game is very soothing. If you would like you can slowly make your way through each puzzle, taking your time and taking in everything the game has to offer. Just as Blocks that Matter was, this game is very charming. I always manage to have a smile on my face when playing through it, either it be the satisfaction of solving the puzzles or even just picking up on some of the funny references they have to different games, books, movies, and music!\n\nThe pacing in the game is pretty nice as well. In total there are 8 sections in the game, each containing 5 normal levels and one key level. Each section slowly adds new mechanics, making game play more complicated yet all the more fun. You never feel overloaded on all of the things you have to learn or solve, but it never drags on either. The Tetrobots act as the sections, each having their own issues. Either they be flooded with water or even frozen! Each Tetrobot’s problem will advance and change the game play, which makes for an excellent thrill when going into a new section.\n\nBesides the overall satisfaction of being able to solve some of these complicated puzzles, the game really helps you feel rewarded for your efforts to progress through the game. There are a lot of cool and interesting unlockables from not only completing the puzzles but collecting the 3 memory blocks there are in each level. Either it is more pieces to the story, a few extra levels, or a collection of all of the soothing songs available. You really have this drive to continue playing through the game.\n\nTetrobot & Co. was a unique game to play through. Its charming style kept me relaxed as I challenged my mind with each level. Swing Swing Submarine really has a way with puzzle games. If you really enjoy puzzle games then I highly suggest you give this one a try.\n\nIf you want some video footage going a tad more in depth on how it plays, then make sure you check out my video on it!\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzGwF68Jbk8&feature=youtu.be\n\n\n","November 25, 2013","true","4.3"," 38 of 46 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","38","46","2","0"

For those whom played blocks that matter and didn't like the platforming aspect, don't worry, this doesn't have any platforming to speak of. The only related things in the game are the characters and the use of blocks.\n\nThe game actually controls through point and click mechanics, moving your character from place to place through just clicking there. The games main focus is using a combination of different blocks which interact with eachother in different ways, in orde to solve a puzzle. Placing blocks involves you shooting them out instead of using the tetronimo mechanic from the last one. Each block has specific functions hinted to ingame once you find them. The game constantly throws new block types at you, as well as special new funtions, mixing things up. They continued to throw new mechanics all the way to the end of the game, and all of them felt well implemented.\n\nYou're main objectives in a level consist of two things; getting to the end, and collecting the memory blocks. You can beat a level without getting all chips, but in order to progress to certain stages, you'll need to obtain the memory blocks. You'll also need to 100% a section to unlock the bonus stage for keys to the small boss puzzle stages (using the term "boss" lightly, as it is really a series of puzzles).\n\nThe game features no way to die, and if you do mess up a puzzle, there is always an undo button to push things back to where you need them in an instant. The game never felt tedious or boring; always throwing new ideas and puzzles types your way. The puzzles, while challenging, never felt too easy, or too hard. The game also never feels the need to hold your hand at any given point.\n\nThe only flaw that I can think of is that there is a bonus challenge later in the game which requires knowledge of the konami code, but it's not required, and is overall a terribly minor flaw on an otherwise great puzzle game.\n\nTo me it was worth every single cent. If you are even remotely into puzzle games, I highly reccomend it.","August 5, 2014","true","12.9"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

The difficulty of the (semi) optional collectible puzzles can get insanely hard, but the solutions always feel fair. Great music, great art, and cute menus.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aetoss/recommended/235980/","Aetoss","Aetoss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aetoss/","149 products in account","I think that this is a great puzzle game until you're about 60% of the way through when they introduce more timing elements into the solutions.  The timing detracts from the game in my opinion, up until then if you understood how to solve something you could solve it in one or two tries.  Once the timing got involved however the 'undo' button was used a lot.  It's very frustrating understanding how to solve a puzzle and having trouble executing that solution.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind which may have an effect of your enjoyment of this game is that if you intend on getting all of the brick pieces (which are the bonus objectives) you may end up undoing a lot of your work in any given level.  The reason behind why you would undo your previous solution is that it may not have been ideal, meaning that you could have saved a block or two which would allow you to get a brick piece.  I'm not sure how I personally feel about it since this is something that has provided me with enjoyment and frustration at different times.  One of my level designer friends really liked this aspect of the game though.\n\nThat being said, I think that the basic mechanics of how the blocks work in relation to each other is very intriguing and leads to a lot of interesting puzzles.  The art is sleek, the music is charming; it feels cohesive.   I recommend Tetrobot and Co. to anyone who loves puzzle games .  The first half is definitely worth your time and depending on your preferences you might like the second half too.","July 22, 2014","true","17.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

You will encounter different blocks and map environment. Some levels are quite tricky for collecting 3 pieces of golden blocks and maybe one further challenging achievement (for example, 3 golden blocks + 6 iron blocks). However, if you really get stuck in one level, you can check the community guides / solutions on youtube.\n\nIts achievement system is good. If you want to 100% this game, you need to beat this game and replay some specific levels (by a smarter approach). Graphic and music are also satisfactory.

Morusque's soundtrack is great and manages the challenge all puzzle games face, which is to produce tracks that are enjoyable to listen to on a loop, and avoid being tedious or formless.  The puzzles themselves are challenging and require some thought but never rely on obtuse jumps in logic, and game mechanics are introduced gradually and with some fun.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, you pilot psychobot, a nano-sized repair bot, through damaged tetrobots in order to restore the larger robots to working order.  Piloting is achieved through pointing & clicking where you'd like psychobot to fly to.  Psychobot can vacuum up blocks of varying sorts in direct line of sight, and fire them as projectiles along the same path (subject to any environmental hazards that might intercept a block).  Blocks themselves are subject to gravity, and stick to like blocks, and it's through these mechanisms that many of the puzzles are crafted.","December 25, 2013","true","21.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

The devilry comes in the form of a progression in puzzle complexity that is both smooth, gradual and fierce. A lot of the fierceness lies in wait for the completionists among us - the real tricksy puzzles only rear their gnarly heads when you're trying to collect all 3 of the "bonus" items in each level. While these items are used to unlock further sets of levels, you can get by without collecting them all. At least to begin with.\n\nThe puzzles themselves mirror the simple/complex nature of the game design. At first, it feels like the only thing you can do will be the solution, but before long, you're looking at a myriad of possibilities, most of which are wrong, many of which will prevent you from being able to collect all three of the bonus items, and one of which is correct.\n\nGood news though, the game has a neat "rewind" feature, allowing you step back move-by-move, which removes any penalty for experimentation. It's a very smart inclusion, as without it, the game would be a frustrating maelstrom of restarts, but with, allows freeform exploration and an infinite amount of spaghetti for you to throw at the wall.\n\nHighly recommended for those that like a game to challenge their brains more than their fingers.","April 10, 2015","true","2.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

It was on sale, so I figured, why not. I do not regret this decision.\n\nWhat a brilliant little game. I was surprised at how quickly the game expected you to think for yourself and really take note of how the mechanics in the environment worked. Each memory block was an AHA! moment, that was then incorporated into later, more complicated puzzles. The pacing is great. The puzzles do become legitimately challenging, but in the way that makes you feel a little bit stupid once you get it, and at the same time, a little bit proud of yourself for figuring it out.\n\nI recomend this game to anyone who wants a fun, well paced little puzzle game.","March 1, 2014","true","12.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The mechanics of the different kinds of blocks are introduced gradually, each with their own kinds of puzzles that they are used to solve. All of the levels have logical solutions, although some aren't obvious - thinking about how to make sure you keep as many blocks as you can in your inventory can be quite tricky! There are certainly some challenging moments, and a few achievements to get you thinking about certain levels in different ways.\n\nAll in all quite fun, and integrated with Steam Workshop if you want to keep the challenge going with user content. A word of advice - for some levels it might pay to step away from the computer and let your mind stew on it for while!","April 10, 2015","true","18.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a puzzle game and has very simple controls (just click the left mouse button) but some of the levels really make you think. You control a little robot, you move by left clicking on a square. Using this robot you travel through various rooms in a given level searching for the end portal. As you explore the level you may find different blocks (wood, sand, stone, sticky jelly) which each have different properties and can react differently in various situations. For example, if you let a laser or fire get near a wood block it will burn and be destroyed, but a sand block turns to glass. In most levels you need to try and conserve as many blocks as you can.\n\nOf course getting to the end portal on each level usually isn't very difficult. However there are three gold coloured blocks on each level, and obtaining all three of those and then getting to the end portal can lead you into some fiendishly brain-teasing logistical puzzles to think your way through. If you sit and think long and hard enough, nothing is beyond your grasp to figure out. If you get frustrated enough (or completely stuck) there is a brilliant guide with a video for how to complete every level, but it's very satisfying to solve everything for yourself (and if you look at a video you'll feel like hitting your head against the wall thinking "it was so obvious, why didn't I see that").\n\nGive your brain some gentle exercise with this charming, fun, and non-violent game.","March 4, 2014","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Additionally, instead of creating tetrominoes you simply chuck blocks around one at a time, however each block reacts to other blocks and environmental hazards differently. This minimalist design philosophy may initially seem to have dumbed down the game, however, like Toki Tori 2, it quickly becomes apparent that the significantly decreased array of options simultaneously makes the puzzles themselves more apparent, and the solutions more laterally realised.\n\nI enjoyed my (considerable) time with Tetrobot and Co. immensely and highly recommend it to anybody in search of a puzzle game which is simple and intuitive to learn, without being simplistic in the execution of the puzzles themselves.","January 2, 2014","true","22.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Smart puzzles, cute story and design, lovely clean sound and visuals.\n\nThe puzzle difficulty varies a bit, from quite obvious to hair-raisingly difficult. The game is almost always fair, and has clever little ante-pieces to demonstrate new mechanics and ideas. A few puzzles could have been tightened up a bit, as they supplied more blocks than were required for the solution. Other than that, Tetrobot is a hugely enjoyable and rewarding experience.\n\nNext to solid mechanics, presentation is always important for me, and boy does this game deliver. The design is simple but clever, the different blocks and environments each look distinctive yet work incredibly well within the overall visual theme of the game. The sounds are an absolute joy, I just love the little clinks and chunks the different blocks make when they connect. They are also functional, in that they let let you know what's happening: lasers go vreee, fire goes woosh, and the Bot makes the cutest little chirping noises when you do something wrong.\n\nAll in all this is a must-buy for puzzle fans.\n\nPS: I'd recommend playing the game on a touch device.

Additionally, instead of creating tetrominoes you simply chuck blocks around one at a time, however each block reacts to other blocks and environmental hazards differently. This minimalist design philosophy may initially seem to have dumbed down the game, however, like Toki Tori 2, it quickly becomes apparent that the significantly decreased array of options simultaneously makes the puzzles themselves more apparent, and the solutions more laterally realised.\n\nI enjoyed my (considerable) time with Tetrobot and Co. immensely and highly recommend it to anybody in search of a puzzle game which is simple and intuitive to learn, without being simplistic in the execution of the puzzles themselves.","January 2, 2014","true","22.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Smart puzzles, cute story and design, lovely clean sound and visuals.\n\nThe puzzle difficulty varies a bit, from quite obvious to hair-raisingly difficult. The game is almost always fair, and has clever little ante-pieces to demonstrate new mechanics and ideas. A few puzzles could have been tightened up a bit, as they supplied more blocks than were required for the solution. Other than that, Tetrobot is a hugely enjoyable and rewarding experience.\n\nNext to solid mechanics, presentation is always important for me, and boy does this game deliver. The design is simple but clever, the different blocks and environments each look distinctive yet work incredibly well within the overall visual theme of the game. The sounds are an absolute joy, I just love the little clinks and chunks the different blocks make when they connect. They are also functional, in that they let let you know what's happening: lasers go vreee, fire goes woosh, and the Bot makes the cutest little chirping noises when you do something wrong.\n\nAll in all this is a must-buy for puzzle fans.\n\nPS: I'd recommend playing the game on a touch device.

So I have to say, for anyone that played the first game and found themselves infuriated by the end: this game is wonderful.\n\nWhere the original had ultra-long, ultra punishing levels, this game has an undo button. Where the original had slippery, floaty platform controls, this game has precise click-based grid movements. While many puzzles in the first game depended on you not only solving the problem at hand but also pulling off difficult platforming maneuvers, this game has gone the pure-puzzle route. Heck, even the story (which doesn't matter much in either game) is better in this one, for what it's worth. Basically, every complaint I ever had about the original Blocks that Matter has been fixed in this sequel.\n\nI also have to make special mention of the soundtrack: while I really enjoyed the original game's chippy blippy soundrtrack, this game takes it in a completely different ambient direction, and actually really, really pleasant to listen to. For several days after finishing the game I had the soundtrack on during work.\n\nAs a final note, I played this game on a Surface Pro 2 (aka a touchscreen computer) and it played very well! There was only one mechanic that was a little awkward on touchscreen, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked out, since I've found that in a lot of games, touchscreen controls do not always work for mouse controls like you'd expect.","December 24, 2015","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story levels don't have much replayability, beyond completion and achievements, but you can easily spend 10+ hours in this game just completing the main story.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend it, especially if it goes on sale.
