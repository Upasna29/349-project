There are secret areas to complete and bosses to beat!\nPerhaps a ideal crowd for this specific tittle would be children but any fun loving adult can enjoy it as-well.\nThere is 2 player co-op either both on keyboard or controller or one of each. You can drop in and out of co-op without needing to restart or go back to a checkpoint or any of that nonsense, just drop in and drop out.\nMy only issue with JUJU is that it seems to be tailored more for girls then for boys. There is a male version of JUJU which you can play in CO-OP but you cant use said character in single player... which i find really odd.\nFore more details you can check out my first impressions video on JUJU :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkSFPELZu0g&list=PLPu1MBLqtny7rnijEzJ3bPSEMepog_rOK","December 10, 2014","true","1.1"," 33 of 46 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","33","46","3","2"

Super vibrant and colorful. It's also a really good platformer game in general. There is a neat idea that I wish more platformers supported, which is to make it easier for a co-op partner to play, such as no hard-fail state if the co-op partner dies.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WNxm0use/recommended/300840/","WNxm0use","X.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WNxm0use/","457 products in account","What is JUJU, other than a badass bongo playing panda?\n\nLike the store describes, it's a platformer featuring an adorable cast of animals, that make music, while engaging in their platforming queste of collecting everything that can be collected.\n\nMy playtime on JUJU is not the highest, I have not yet completed the game either. However I have finished the first world segment, engaged in boss fights, played bongos, learned how to fly and managed to get a grasp that's good enough for a first impression.\n\nMind you, this review is personal bound, you may agree or disagree, I speak for no-one but myself.\n\nWhat does JUJU right?\n\n+ JUJU's levels are relatively short, this however is not a bad thing but makes it ideal for a game you just pick up and play   for a short while till you've got your fill. It also helps that the levels are relatively short as you have portals in each level that can only be attempted once during a given run.\n\n+ JUJU's world is a beautiful, vibrantly coloured world that really comes to life with all the critters wandering around in it. The use of colour also engages the player in exploring each nook and cranny for portals or other little secrets.\n\n+ Music, while I've heard the same music being played over again, it doesn't hinder or get annoying. It's quiet fitting with the theme of the game and the level design.\n\n+ Difficulty, the game gives you an initial laydown of the controls in the very first level you enter, however after that it's reduced to a minimal popup of explanations (I recall having seen one after defeating a boss). The game introduces new hazards, new enemies, new interactive platforms gradually while playing through a level. It also does this in a way that you don't get overwhelmed.\n\n+ Enemies, there are plenty of them, they look different, they have their own unique little thing. Stomping crabs is all fun and games, getting needles in your fluffy behind from a hedgehog costs you a life!\n\n+ Drop-in / Drop-out Co-Op. No need to do it at the start of a level or at a checkpoint, you can do it at any given time.\n\nWhat has bothered me about JUJU so far?\n\n- Camera, while I'd say the camera is your buddy 90% of the time, there are moments where it seems to have somewhat of a difficulty keeping up with your character, this can lead to cringe worthy deaths that could have been easily avoided. Granted the levels are short so you don't lose a whole lot of progress, everything you did in between checkpoints has to be done over though.\n\n- Relatively short, the game seems to be relatively short. I've completed the first world and my progress is at 23%. Looking at the background in the menu I'm going ahead and assume there are 4 worlds total. While there is some replayabillity, their isn't much to do in a level once you have completed it.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes.\nDo I recommend it for it's current price? If you're out for a quick platformer fix that can be played solo or in co-op without expacting anything of extraordinary length, yes.","December 13, 2014","true","1.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/t0b3/recommended/300840/","t0b3","iddqd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/t0b3/","2743 products in account","So there's a lof of things done right in this platforming game:\n\n+ Beautiful level design\n+ Underwater levels which remind me of Donke Kong Country and thus, are fun\n+ Great controls and visuals\n+ The music is at least decent\n+ The game offers a lot of content. Time Trial, Hardcore mode, bonus levels.. you can find anything!\n\nBut of course, there are also a few negative aspects about this game. Which ones you ask? Well I'm so glad you asked, so here they are:\n\n- The bonus levels are always the same and thus, bore quite quickly\n- If you fail a bonus level, you have to kill yourself in order to be able to retry\n- There are no explanations nor a manual in the game whatsoever. If you forget how to do several things, you're on your own\n- The moving speed is too slow\n\nI'd still recommend this game to platformer fans, though. If you liked New Super Mario Bros, Banjo-Kazooie or any game similar, you will love this.\n","June 27, 2015","true","7.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

There are lots of very forgiving mechanics that let an adult and a child play together. (even small children, i play this with my 4yo) After playing for a while i can let him play himself, only to drop in from time to time to help out in tricky parts. He loves it and i enjoy it too.\n\n\n","December 31, 2014","true","19.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

If you are a fan of more traditional platformers and adventure games then this may be right down your alley.

If you didn't already guess, it's VERY heavily based off of the old school Donkey Kong games on the SNES as well as the current Donkey Kong Country Return game on the Wii. From the special stages, the music, sounds and even the areas you visit. This is seriously one of those budget games that parents buy kids when they can't afford the real deal so they get the cheap knock off game instead. Saying that, I still enjoyed the game. I played it from start to finish, got everything that mattered and have no intention on going back to play it again because there is nothing else after beating the game. I bought it in hopes it'd be a gem that was overlooked because of how childish it looked but alas, I gambled, I lost. Tis the fun in the betting world.

When his father is distracted curiosity gets the better of the children and they interfere with the ritual unwittingly opening up portals between worlds; unleashing hoards of demonic creatures amongst them and allowing Juju's father is captured by one of these eldritch horrors. Juju and Peyo have to battle through the different worlds to retrieve parts of the talisman to rescue Juju's father whilst he is subjected to unthinkable torment… in a family friendly way.\n\nThis is a charming, colourful, casual platformer which is obviously aimed at children but still very enjoyable for adults. It looks good and the music is fun. The controls and enemies are quick to get the grips with and new concepts are introduced gradually. It is best enjoyed with a partner but the second player can drop in and out at any time. There are bonus levels hidden throughout which are a bit repetitive but completing them all unlocks some extra levels which are more challenging.\n\nAll in all this is excellent, I wish there were more local co-op games of this quality available.","March 6","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
