This might be the first game that ever blend these two together!\nI think I am one of the lucky ones who get to try OPUS before launch date. Definitely unexpected gameplay-wise and a little bit hard to describe, kinda like Where's Waldo but a lot more interactive, and you'll get lost in space, a lot. I like it since it neatly blends storytelling together to something different from any other games I've played before.\n\nI recommend everyone to choose a night when none of your friends invited you for dinner, situate yourself in a dark dark room, and slowly sink into the galaxy and forget about everything else. The story is a little bit sad so you might shed some tears.","April 22","true","28.6"," 72 of 84 people (86%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","86","72","84","9","0"

And if you'd bother to check a little bit more you'll also find out the game last no longer than 2 hrs for average players. But in fact that's exactly part the point of this game:\n\nFor a novel, fresh experience & gameplay in games, you don't absolutely need 50hrs of play time or super innovative, convoluted, unseen or complex mechanics to achieve those. There are all kinds of interesting short and interesting games in the indie scene right now that you won't regret paying 5 or 10 bucks on them. For 90 ~ 120 minutes of the gameplay, OPUS provides a quite touching, and even deep, philosophical experience, if you know what you are looking at.\n\nI am an avid space-themed media junkie, so the astronomical side of OPUS also highly interests me. But there's a thin layer of somewhat deceiving sugarcoat there, if I may say so. The scientific detail or the accuracy of terms and descriptions in the game sometimes doesn't add-up, even though improvements have already been made since the mobile version. But again, that's not really the point.\n\nI am going to boldly claim that the game's astronomical / science aspect is only there to support it's narrative, just like Interstellar (YES, THAT CHRIS NOLAN MOVIE) -- even more, the central idea of OPUS can actually draw a few parallel comparison from Interstellar directly.\n\nYou know right from the beginning of the game, that hundred of thousands years into the distant future, human race has somehow forgotten its origin, and Earth has long become a myth. And one important character in game totally doesn't believe there is even an Earth at all. Just like in Interstellar, the general public has long "disapprove" the idea that human has been to the Moon and beyond, and no one believe in any of those grand idea anymore.\n\nOf course, I am not really claiming that a small indie team can produce something that really rivals a worldly-acclaimed award-winning Hollywood movie, nor does it take as serious an approach to science as the Nolan film to cover its philosophical / spiritual ideas, but it's already an effort very rarely seen in games, in my opinion.\n\nTo say anything more about the narrative or story about OPUS would be a huge spoiler for the game itself, so I'll stop here. I only hope that my review can help you look into the game a little bit more, before you start nitpicking its problems. The game is not expensive, it will not cost you a lot of time and energy, the gameplay is smooth and I think the difficulty curve is just right for this kind of experience. So by all means try it out for yourself!\n\n\nEDIT: typo","April 23","true","2.4"," 49 of 58 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","49","58","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/recommended/457680/","EdenStarGazer","EdenStarGazer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/","429 products in account","The Day I Found Opus a Sci-fi Indie Adventure game that will have you exploring, and seeing, the stars differently. I found Opus today, and of course played until I’d 100%ed the game. Though there are 31 achievies, they all come pretty normally through the story. By the time I’d finished the story, I had surveyed over 500 stars, which is the achievement just before the highest of 1000. But, I still had to locate a final supernova and a moon of one of the planets, along with the last 500 stars to survey, so that final count took a little grinding.\n\nNarrative:\nStory rich in a tantalizing and sentimental mystery, you are immersed in this charming tale of dreams, or goals. The title comes from the Latin phrase “Magnum Opus,” or “Great Work.” You start in a spaceship as a robot named Emeth. I’m totally unsure if that name comes from some Easter egg, or maybe it’s an acronym. But, two scientists are aboard with you and they are searching for the planet Earth, which was the origin of the human race, according to myth. They are growing doubtful they’ll find it, if it ever really existed, before they are too late to save mankind. The story presupposes that the gene pool has decayed to the point that survival is not expected. They need to return to Earth to collect more of their original genes. The robot is motivated by the female scientist to continue searching, despite the growing pessimism of the male scientist who is aboard with them. Then a power outage occurs, Lisa and the other scientist disappear, and a hologram of Lisa guides or assists Emeth in his search to find the missing planet Earth.\n\nStory Mechanic:\nOpus takes a single game mechanic that is also present in the new Stellaris, by Paradox Studios, and does it even better. Lisa, the female protagonist, has programmed Emeth to operate Opus’s telescope. Opus is the large ship they are inside. When you turn on the telescope, you are gazing at the stars and you are able to scan in search of habitable planets matching the characteristics of Earth. Meanwhile, the hud overhead displays tabs for your target coordinates, target section/sector, target zone, & filters needed. Just beneath the display of tabs is a button for the Earth Locator, which functions to guide you to each of your missions and sub-missions, target planets & stars to explore.\n\nThe Earth Locator gives you clues to help you locate where the target star will be. You watch the display on your telescope and follow the degrees of rotation to calculate where you are, and where you need to be to find the target. This is comparable to flying an airplane by Instrument Flight Readings (IFR.) But, if you pay attention to the tabs at the top, each one lights up or turns off as you enter a zone or sector matching the description for your target, making it possible to just pilot “by the seat of your pants” as they say in Visual Flight Readings (VFR,) or flying by sight. If all the tabs are lit up, then you’ve found the right area. Also, a hint button will appear far right that will point you in the general direction, and you won’t find it too difficult.\n\nComparisons:\nOther than the comparison to Stellaris in the way you explore the stars, I find this game reminded me very much of Firewatch. In Firewatch you were given realistic navigation tools to find your way around a map of the forest. Opus does likewise, but you’re searching through the galaxy. Also, Opus has an immersive mystery story much like Firewatch. And, it keeps you engaged until you finish the game.\n\nThe developer, Team Signal, is an indie company that has a few mobile games thus far. I checked out a couple of them myself and found both Earthworm Alchemy and Hyper Square fun and free on my phone.\n\nPros:\nStory Rich\nEngaging & fun mechanics you’ll love\nGraphics are nicely done in a cartoony style, No bugs or glitches\nCould be fun for any age gamer\nDecent  Soundtrack\nGreat price at $8.99\n\nCons:\nIt is one simple aspect of exploration, but it does that extremely well.\nNo strategy/ quite linear gameplay\nRequires meticulous patience for scanning a thousand stars.\nFinal game section has major flashing lights that may be problematic for some\n\nI highly recommend Opus: The Day We Found Earth for anyone who loves stargazing, space, exploration, and solving mystery, while enjoying a strong immersive story. No Spoilers Here! I think the best way to play this game is to go into it spoiler free. So, I’ll leave my review at this.","May 27","true","7.2"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","20","20","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fenrakk101/recommended/457680/","Fenrakk101","Fenrakk101","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fenrakk101/","290 products in account","OPUS is a wonderful experience, and I highly recommend it. The story isn't flawless, but it did succeed in nearly bringing me to tears, which is still something only a few games have accomplished - and it achieved that in under an hour and a half. If you're not someone who inherently hates iOS ports, you'll find something to love in OPUS.\n\nThat being said, I'm much better at writing criticisms, and I do have a major gripe with the game. When starting the story, you are prompted to choose between "Normal Mode" and an easier "Story Mode": Normal Mode promises to hold your hand less, while Story Mode promises to carry you through the story as painlessly as possible. So I chose Normal Mode, of course, but then it never actually felt like the game let my hand go. The story progresses by scanning specific planets, which the game points you directly towards - it points you to a general area where the star can be found, and the star is always the brightest one there. Even when those areas become larger, the game provides you a means to narrow the search down to a handful yet again, meaning you can realistically complete the game without ever scanning a "wrong" system, even on your first playthrough.\n\nAs soon as you scan one planet, you are immediately told where the next one is. First, this raises a lot of serious questions about the plot - how did they ever have trouble finding Earthlike planets when they're so helpfully mapped out for you? But even purely as a gameplay mechanic, I believe it genuinely detracted from my experience. More than anything, it actively discouraged me from exploring the actual map: the characters are constantly pattering about how they desperately need to scan the next planet, and the next planet is always right in front of you, so what kind of jerk would make them wait so you can go look for that supernova you just found out about? It also makes the whole scanning mechanic seem completely pointless; if you ever scan an incorrect planet, you feel like you've only wasted your time (more on that in a moment). I would have much preferred a mechanic where you would be told an even broader area to scan in, and you would need to randomly scan planets in the area to find clues to the next candidate - a reason to actually make you want to look around. As it stands, by the time the story gets to the "we're now desperate so we need to look fast" section, I didn't really feel much pressure, since I had felt pressured to rush the story scans from the very beginning.\n\nAnd about scans being pointless: why on Earth is there an achievement for scanning 1000 systems? As mentioned, you'll probably get through the story with barely over 25 scans, and extra scans up to that points were already a waste of time; what's the point in asking players to sit around for 2.5 hours clicking on star after star, just so they can see the "that's not Earth, stupid" message pop up hundreds of times? I really wish developers would stop adding achievements that may as well read "do a boring and repetitive task over and over and over for us."\n\nClosing statements on OPUS: Did you miss the first paragraph? Go buy OPUS, it's a beautiful, if brief, title. I only criticize it so much because I'm an obnoxious prick, and I believe giving games a free pass on critique just because they're indie or because they're iOS ports is fairly patronising.","May 3","true","4.1"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","14","15","4","1"

I'm going red thumb for balance reasons since there are already so much positive reviews explaining why you should buy this game.\nIf you did not read any of those here's a TL;DR : Great atmosphere (especially the music), unique experience, nice story and lovable characters. If that's enough for you, go ahead and buy this game. The bonus developer commentary you get is a nice touch as well.\n\nHowever i feel like this game have a poor lifespan to price ratio. You can rush through the story in like 2 hours. Took me 8 hours to get 100% (some idle time included, probably possible in less than 5) but that's with a very stupid achievement which requires 1000 stars scanned. I only went for it because i kinda have achievement OCD. Wasnt that long but it was tedious and very unnecessary.\nThere is no challenge whatsoever even in the "normal" difficulty setting. The gameplay is original but repetitive. It's not exactly a visual novel but yeah the emphasis is on the story, not the gameplay.\nAlso i dont know if it's just me but at some point the telescope is damaged which makes your screen shaky and it really ♥♥♥♥ed up my eyes and damaged my immersion.\n\nSo whether you should buy this game or not really depends on what you're looking for.","May 8","false","8.3"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","16","28","0","0"

Note that my ability to enjoy a game is not influenced by how I recieved it. If you would like to see the TL;DR, go to the summary at the bottom of the review.\nOPUS: The Day We Found Earth is an atmospheric story-driven game, with elements that make it partly a visual novel.\n\nYou play as Emeth, a childlike robot who has been given the tasking of finding the long forgotten planet Earth. This is essentially the premise of the game and the story it follows. Playing as Emeth is unique in the sense that whilst you are controlling him, you are looking at him more from the perspective of LISA (an AI version of your creator, Doctor Lisa). I don't want to ruin this for you by delving into it too much, but to put it simply: you are always ahead of Emeth, but this surprisingly never faults the story and actually adds more emotion to the game. This story aspect is definitely the strongest of the game and to fans of story-driven games, the intriguing characters and atmospheric story would provide an enjoyable playthrough.\n\nOn the other hand, the gameplay may disappoint some. The game tries to have unique gameplay aspects, which in some sense it does, but it starts to become repetitive at some point (which is especially not good for a game that requires around 2 hours to complete). The effort to try and stop this happening is displayed through the mostly little dialogue that interrupts you each time you discover a new star, which quickly becomes annoying. A breif explanation as to what this gameplay is like would be that it's almost similar to a hidden-object game, just with very little emphasis on the 'hidden' part. A positive towards the gameplay would be the fact that it still provides a somewhat relaxing experience, but despite this, without the engaging story the game would have barely anything to stand on.\n\nVisually, OPUS: The Day We Found Earth provides some really great art, something that would definitely be required to make the game a true stargazing experience.\n\nMuch like the artstyle, OPUS also provides some really good music that soothes the ears and suits each moment of the game.\n\nNow for what is the biggest reason this game receives negative reviews: the price. To be honest, they have a point. For 8.99 USD, 2 hours of gameplay is quite overpriced and most probably not worth it. You can see the attempt to try to increase that time by adding in a tedious achievement that will probably bore you more than anything whilst trying to reach it.\n\n\nSummary:\nPros:\n✔ Mostly relaxing gameplay\n✔ Engaging story\n✔ Great artsyle\n✔ Great music\n\nCons:\n✘ Repetitive gameplay\n✘ Overpriced\n\nConclusion:\nOPUS: The Day We Found Earth is an enjoyable atmospheric experience, but certainly not for everyone. If you are going to pick it up, make sure to catch it on sale (around $3 USD)\n\nRating: 7.2/10\n\nDid you enjoy that review?

I just wanted to explore a bit around, but in the end, I didn't quite understood what was the game expecting of me, gameplay wise, besides completing some achievements.\n\nOverall it felt that the game tried to do more than be just a "walking simulator" and compromised a bit too much to achieve that goal.\n\nIt is a keeper for me, but I can't really recommend it.","April 25","false","4.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I got the game first on Android and immediately loved it. It is not a game you can pull out of your pocket and play for 5 minutes. It is a game you need to leave yourself alone, put on your headphones, and immerse into the world.\n\nThe music is just AMAZING! Especially at the ending, I can still feel it resonates from deep of my heart. The story is very touching and well arranged. Compared with the first mobile version I played, all the story moment is now fully and nicely animated, which is something I want badly. Super happy I played it again on PC.\n\nAlso as a side effect of knowing the story beforehand, now all the items in the spaceship carry different meanings, not only the background story but also hints here and there. I'm surprised to find out the pictures on the wall, Lisa's notes and books, the name of stars and planets discovered by Lisa now all make sense. More deeply the game is full of metaphors. If you read carefully, the name and symbols for each zone and sections, the default name of the stars, the room background in the spaceship are all meaningful! I'll stop here rather than spoil it. But really, these are the stuff you would probably only find out in a second round.\n\nI always prefer a condensed awesome and meaningful experience than long mediocre hours, and OPUS hit right in my sweet spot. Would love to see more games like this coming from this studio!","April 23","true","2.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tagwolf/recommended/457680/","tagwolf","Tag Wolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tagwolf/","1329 products in account","Developers or Moderators deleted forum post which contained feedback and feature requests I thought would be beneficial to making gameplay more interesting.\n\nThis is the first time I've had this happen. Maybe it was a mistake, I can't say. But as I get the impression they do not appreciate user feedback, I cannot recommend the game on that alone. However even if that wasn't the case, in my suggestions I brought up several things that impact this game in a negitive way.\n\nThis game has a pretty solid story. But the pacing it terrible.\n\nYou play a small robot looking for earth. You search for it by aligning your telescope using the mouse or keyboard to grid coordinates or a general "In this area kinda", type instructions given to you by the computer.\n\nYou scan stars in the area you think the match is in until you find a planet that is a high percentage match of earth, but is not really earth.\n\nYou do this over and over again, with little variation in play, in between each star, you are shown a view of the ship and read through some dialogue, mostly about how the robot misses it's friend.\n\nYour character appears in multiple locations on the ship as you progress and unlock new areas. However, these areas serve no other purpose in the game besides a different background to read more dialogue.\n\nI felt like there are so many missed opportunities that would have made this a great game.\n\nFor example, incorporating zoom and focus into the telescope. Piloting the ship and repositioning it. Really, by the 10th planet that wasn't earth, I was really feeling antsy and begging for the game to give me some other task to do.\n\nBestowed upon you about 1/3rd through the game, is a computer aided locator, which lights up on average 3-5 possible stars that are the one you need to scan. This actually made the game even less fun because it removed difficulty from gameplay instead of increasing it.\n\nTowards the end, you are given one new mechanic. It consists of a filter, which shows something similar to IR light when looking at space. The game has you use this about 3 times total before the end of the game and tells you when you need to use it.\n\nReally I understand wanting a story based game and a casual experience. But in my opinion the dialogue felt more like it took me out of the experience more than made me hopeful to hear more story. This is mainly because you listen to more dialogue in the game after EVERY SCAN of an earthlike planet. Which means about once every 2 minutes. Most of this dialogue is not worth interrupting the player, showing the ship, and going through more dialogue.\n\nThis filler dialogue should be spaced out and for the non essential stuff, it should happen while you are looking for things and during scanning.\n\nOnce you finish the story. You unlock Normal mode. Where you can spend time clicking on random stars and scanning them. All gameplay functions in both Story and Normal Mode are as follows: Pan Up/Down/Left/Right, Filter On/Off, Scan.\n\nThis gameplay mode offers you nothing new, other than to continue scanning the 100,000,000 star systems in the game and naming them. Literally the most feedback the game offers is a random percentage of how close that planet is to earth, a picture, and a description of why it doesn't support life or isn't like earth. Once you finish the story I don't see much point in playing in normal because at the core, it just isn't varied enough to be fun.\n\nI think this had so much potential. I am sad to see parts of this game that just have a failed execution. I hope the developers rethink some of the mechanics and make the experience a bit more captivating and varied. All the foundations are there. If they do I'll be sure to change my review.\n\nCurrently however, this plays more like a visual novel with a hidden object mini-game. That would be the best way to go into this I think.\n\nI will give the game credit though. It does have a really nice graphical feel. Soothing music. A unique direction and above all, it's got a lot of heart. But for the reasons above, that heart just isn't enough for me. I would give it shot if scanning the sky in the game in a casual and very basic fasion sounds fun to you, but I think that after the story you'll probably never touch it again. That is what bums me out because this has an opportunity to be something really special.","May 1","false","5.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

Firstly, if you're expecting a good story... Then you got it. This game does a very good job at keeping you at suspense and then giving you little hints as to the happenings of the world around your characters. The two main protagonists in this game are very humorous and reminds me highly of Wall-E and EVA from the movie Wall-E.\n\nThe gameplay is simple but it works very well. You won't get confused at it too much and there's always a little 'Hint' button to direct you in the general direction of the area you need to check out although that might be due to Story mode and not the other mode.\n\nThe music amplifies the gameplay experience a lot. It's a HUGE difference to be able to play this game with the music and without it. It really set the atmosphere and assisted in the narrative of the game as well.\n\nNow the game isn't really too long, around 2-3 hours in one entire session until you reach the end. Double that if you play the other mode as well to find all the collectibles and other scraps of the story.\n\nIn fact I'd say this game would be criminal to charge me so much for such a short game but I forgive it. Why? The story affected me, the music affected me, and those were the goals of the developers as they have stated themselves. They achieved that goal with me and thus, I'd say my money was well spent. I even bought the soundtrack.\n\nAnd the ending is one of those endings that you'll love but wish there were more.","April 28","true","2.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You operate a futuristic space telescope and are tasked with finding a series of planets and other astronomical objects given only a very incomplete skymap, some cryptic hints, and a couple of magic decoder keyring-style tools.\n\nThis might sound monotonous, but there is sufficient variety and the game had a well balanced difficulty ramp. More importantly, I was always highly motivated to find each new planet in order to unlock the next chapter of the story. The plot and setting form the core of this game - if not that unique or groundbreaking, it was still very touching and well written. You start out with the goal of (re)discovering the long lost planet Earth in order to save a distant future version of humanity, but this cliched opening quickly gives way to more personal motivations. The story and characterizations are revealed through a combination of dialog, found artifacts, and flashbacks - once again, quite sparse but effective at letting you fill in the details of what happened in the past.\n\nSome technical issues were my only real complaints. On my Surface Pro 3, the cinematics were inexplicably very choppy (probably less than 5 frames per second for what I assume would be a 24fps movie); in addition, there was an alarmingly high number of typos - "hybernation", missing prepositions, incorrect plurals, etc. But they don't detract heavily from a well worthwhile experience.","April 24","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

OPUS: The Day We Found Earth not only had my attention from start to finish, but the only game I have played through without stopping, regardless of it's short length. The story in this game is truely a gem. You take the role of Emeth, a robot designed to hunt for the now mythically lost-to-the-ages Earth aided by a motherly shipboard AI, meanwhile unravelling a mystery the OPUS ship is hiding from you. Your character is endearingly simplistic, but matures bit by bit as the dual plots entwine.\n\nThe gameplay is focused and tuned for the length of the game. Yes, this is a short game, maybe only two hours, but remains fresh with new mechanics added that are quickly mastered before another layer is added on top. Playing on the upper difficulty does require you to utilize the systems available to you, and your ability to start recognizing the stars and nebula you gaze up at. The music is wonderfully crafted to the atmosphere of the game, both grandiose and subtle as needed. The art is charming and lively, vividly able to express the emotions of the characters.
