Everything might technically work, but the actual game in every aspect leaves your frustrated and confused as to how someone could create such a horrible product.\n\nFirst of all, there's no fullscreen option, and there's no sound options, or basically anything useful, but it's not really a huge problem, since you can press ALT+ENTER and get fullscreen whenever you want.  I tried to press on 'button config' but it kept just bringing me back to the main menu.    Sometimes it will give you a screen which shows that it wants you to press a button and nothing seems to work, or in some cases if there is 20 lines of dialog it will all just instantly skip without any indication as to why or what you did, it just does things on it's own.  I tried recording some video, and I couldn't help but notice that the game goes fullscreen on it's own sometimes, by simply pressing 'A' alone after like the 5th screen it would go fullscreen everytime I tapped 'A'.  I'll give them credit for having controller support, but I give them no credit for making a playable game.  It's awful.  Played through the first level a few times now and it's sort of decently priced at launch ($2) but in my opinion, it's not really worth your time.\n\nThe introductary prologue part I went to, clicked on once, it gave a date and a time on a black screen and then went back to the main menu instantly.  Upon choosing story mode it just shows that I successfully completed the prologue.\n\nVirtually every time you press a button on your controller you are wasting your time with this stupid broken game.  There is absolutely no hint of polish or video game development experience.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nuy2ry1R7s","June 10, 2015","false","4.7"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","19","26","2","4"

The story is . . uh . . there i think, all the buttons do the same thing in menu which seems to be nothing. I mean clearly there's a skeleton here for something better but I think they just gave up and moved on . .I mean you cant change the screen or volume or or ...ugh what a waste","June 10, 2015","false","3.5"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","10","14","2","2"

Shameful that such a shoddy, bug ridden, ham fisted program should be released on Steam as a finished product. No options to adjust the music or sound, selecting 'back to menu' crashes the game. The first chapter has you literally clicking through text. No attempt at gameplay at all. Give me one day and a programming for beginners book and I could knock something up more fun that this. Hmmm that gives me an idea, WTF am I doing wasting time writing this review.","July 23, 2015","false","6.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

Some parts of it, like the story and art, seem as though they had a lot of effort put into them, if perhaps not that much skill. Likewise, it seems as though the developer may have dealt with some downright shadiness when it came to how Desura/IndieRoyale treated him. (as seen on his blog: http://singestudio.blogspot.fr/2015/08/final-comments.html )\n\nOn the other hand, the result is just a pile of crap that feels in many places as though the author had never played a side-scrolling shooter before, with wonky and giant hitboxes, a forced position in the middle of the screen that doesn't give you much time to react to enemies once you see them, enemies that are obscured by the distracting backgrounds, background objects that position themselves in front of enemies, controls that are never really explained, and long missions that you have to restart from the beginning if you die. The first "side story" is supposed to be a tutorial, but there doesn't seem to be any way to complete it or even get beyond the first screen, as the tutorial guy never continues talking after his first line.\n\nSo yeah. I hope the author doesn't swear off game development for good, but this was a terrible first effort in a lot of ways, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone except people who are more patient with bad games than I am (and that's saying a lot...) and really want to play a game about the adventures of power-suited superheroes.\n\n(I did not complete this - I spent about ten minutes fighting with the controls and the apparently broken tutorial, and then after several tries completed the first real level. I tried the second level once, but decided there was absolutely no way I was going to enjoy this and that I would just delete it and be done with it.)","December 21, 2015","false","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I launched it, couldnt open settings, everytime I tried to go to button configuration the game freaked out and brought me back to the home screen, the "back to main menu" button crashes the game. But, easily the worst thing about this game is that it doesnt work. When you click on a level it brings you into a loading screen where there is an animated icon in the top right corner where a finger is repetedly pushing a button, i pressed every button on my keyboard and i could never get past the ♥♥♥♥ING LOADING SCREEN, the closest i could get is that "p" for some mother ♥♥♥♥ing reason PAUSES THE LOADING SCREEN, useful right? I know you have to press something to get by this loading screen because i got past the first loading screen by smashing my keyboard until it worked, also game play wise this game also sucks. It tries to throw this god awful, cringe inducing convoluted story at you that has nothing to do with what you're doing in game; but thats another story. This game is amateur AT BEST, and thats being extremely generous of me. DO NOT BUY.","June 11, 2015","false","0.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

But you still get cash even when you die, so it won't be for nothing.\nI like the music and feeling of destruction you make, especially when you level up a bit and go into lower zones.\nLeveling up your char, and upgrading your abilities with special coins, which.. I still have to find out how to get.\n\nI didn't like the dialogues to much, there is some humor in it. But it couldn't really keep my attention.\nAction feels a bit clumsy and the characters are unbalanced.\nAn additional note is that you can't play on fullscreen (although it still fills up until your taskbar).\n\nSo is it a taker? That's up to you, the price ain't that high. And if your into this sort of games, there is plenty of hours of gameplay to put in.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVa3ZZRTezA","June 8, 2015","true","2.6"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","7","16","0","1"

The dialogue was about 15 minutes at the start (I skipped it and it was still long). I wouldn't mind if it was actually intresting. I would reccomend this if more effort went into this but this is like a school project.","February 16","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
