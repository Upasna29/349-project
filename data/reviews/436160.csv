There is no creativity or time or thought put into this "game", just a time waster. I'm pretty sure when I was younger I played something similar to this on Facebook. Basicly, if you want something that will numb you to the world for a little while, this game should do, and best part is that it's free, but if want something with a little more depth you might have to fork over a few bucks on a different game.","April 27","false","5.7"," 47 of 60 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","47","60","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badhairqueen/recommended/436160/","badhairqueen","badhairqueen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badhairqueen/","55 products in account",""The Panic Room offers an exciting hidden object experience."\n\nUm, no.\nThrough the extremely fragmented, poorly written and linguistically broken narrative and game direction, I sort of gathered that the so-called story was about you being locked up in a house with some other people, with "tasks" assigned to you by someone called the "Puppeteer" from time to time. Successful completion of those tasks would either unlock new rooms or give some sort of reward.\n\nOr whatever, really.\n\nI made some screenshots of the game text/dialogue so you can see if you can make more sense out of it than me.\n\nAnyway, if you decide to disregard the story and play the game for what it really is, then all you have is a hidden object game where you mainly find the same 4 objects (violin, stack of books, hat, radio) over and over and over.\n\nStill, I lasted a while just to see how bad the narrative would get.\n\nThere apparently is also some kind of "life" system, and you can ask friends to gift you health pills or whatever nonsense (don't know how that works, but it will bring up a window where you can make this request to all the people on your Steam friends list).\n\nEach time you enter a room, your life depletes, because you somehow get "cut" on the door handle. Dunno what this was about; your character briefly mentions it off the cuff and then that was it.\n\n(@__@)\n\nSee, that's the problem with this game. The text is AWFUL. Beyond awful. Things are brought up that come out of nowhere, and there's no heads or tails to anything at all, from story, to characters, to the various game features such as coins, feathers, life points and other miscellaneous junk that litter the game periphery.\n\nImagine your friend suddenly coming up to you and saying, "Then yesterday it happened again, but I didn't know because Sam told them you were there."\n\nYour reaction would be, "HUH??????????" right?\n\nSo that basically was my reaction to this game.\n\nOh, and despite the many buttons and features, I couldn't find a "save" or "exit" option. It's not under game settings. In the end I had to close the game by resizing it to windowed mode then pressing the "X" that Windows so kindly provides us with.\n\nRating: -10/10\nThis game creates negative utility for the player and robs him of brain cells. Avoid at all cost, unless you are paid to play this. (In which case, you still have to see if it's worth the damage this game will do to you.)","May 3","false","0.6"," 34 of 42 people (81%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","81","34","42","7","9"

Grinding\nYou actually have to play the same room over and over again. There are 3 modes, Word mode, Silhouette mode and Night mode. In Word mode, you look for the object matching a word. In Silhouette mode, you look for the object that looks like its shadow. In Night mode, everything is dark and you search with flashlight.\n\n2. Boring\nThe items are mixed around in the same few locations. It's so boring.\n\n3. Asking for More Health from Your Friends\nWTF?

That means you need to add friends to send you energy and health and all that other gubbins, to enable you to playy some more, and then you'd send them energy and health packs, to allow them t play some more.  On top of this there is monetisation/microtansactions, to enable you to get more items to unlock things sooner etc.\n\nIt's not my sort of game because of those very reasons, though I usually like hidden object type games.\n\nI'm giving it a thumb's down because while it does look nice I've seen better.  I've been sat ehre thinking 'Wtf is that thing supposed to be?' even after it's been collected successfully.  So it does nothing to stand out fromt eh crowd, and it's dependence on the whole 'social' aspects weigh it down.

Little does Brendan know, he's actually sequencing a code for opening the door to The Rock's Scorpion mummy tomb. Even though he's getting negative Steam Reviews, he continues to hound players and force them to do his menial tasks. He even forces a 30 year old version of Jenny Weasely to help, most likely kidnapping her from Harry. The Cowboys from Brokeback Mountain even make an appearance. One of them is poisoned and you save him by picking up firewood and violins for Brendan. If only G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra and Pawn Shop Chronicles were good movies... If only he could still guest star on King of the Hill and Fairly Odd Parents... Maybe, just maybe, it wouldn't have come to this.\n\nI recommend this game to people who want Brendan Fraser's weeny in their butt.\n\nI do not recommend it for people who didn't like the Mummy because it's pretty much the same thing except you don't actually see The Scorpion Mummy Rock it's just implied.","April 28","false","0.1"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","61","17","28","16","0"

First thing to address, for anyone that said "this belongs on facebook", well....that's where it came from, so it is VERY a facebook game.\nPROS:  If you like hidden object, and don't mind or even like the "go here, get that" type objectives, I think you'll like this game.  Interesting story and varying gameplay (modes, objects in differest spots). Plus, you have hidden object, collections, and other interactives (rats/ravens, the yard). I think they do well to keep something as repetitive as hidden object, interesting!  Then, just to throw it a little newness, there are special "events" pretty regularly.\nCONS:  This is not your play all night kind of game.  If you want something to immerse yourself in, this isn't in.  Health is used to enter rooms and takes quite a while to recover (although, at higher levels, you DO have enough health to play for a bit longer than low level) , and if you wanna purchase health and amulets to help find items, you can spend a lot pretty quick.  Also, it's more difficult to play the game without friends (game came from facebook), so some combining items, small health items, and pieces that make buffs for more coins and stuff, come from them.  Biggest thing that irks me, is if you are getting a collection or something for a quest, do NOT combine collection until quest says to, or it won't count it, and you gotta collect all over again.\n\nAll in all, it's a nice game, especially if you may be looking for a non immersive, kill an hour type game.  You can leave this game, come back and go right back into what you were doing.  For free to play, I think it's great!","May 3","true","37.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","1"

First off the gameplay is much faster on Steam (the loading times on FB drive me nuts!).  Of course the con is that you are starting over, there seems to be no place to enter your member ID# (hint, hint) and you have to find friends all over again to help you play.\nStill as a relative newbie to the game (I haven't reached level 30 yet on FB), I am willing to give this a chance and see where it leads.  Good or bad, I will update this review as I get more experience. I will also keep up my FB gameplay so that I have a bit of an edge on where the story is going.","April 27","true","17.8"," 12 of 38 people (32%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","32","12","38","0","0"
