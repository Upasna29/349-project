"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lozelda/recommended/368590/","lozelda","LoZelda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lozelda/","81 products in account","This is a game I really want to like. The art style, and even the puzzle elements, are pretty reminiscent of Limbo, but presented in a longer format that lends itself well to developing a deeper story. Yet, after the completion of Episode 1 (a 2.5 hour adventure) we know very little, if anything at all, about the story or the world it is set in.  I find myself with more questions than anything else, and not in that intriguing "oh man I can't wait to see what all this stuff is" sort of way, but in that "seriously why am I even here" manner.\n\nSome of the physics needs help. Your ability to levitate objects has a massive yo-yo effect on said object, and it takes far too long for the object to stabilize.  This is not a big deal in situations where you're able to solve puzzles at your own pace, but in many segments you have a limited amount of time and one shot to get it correct.  This is easily the most consistently frustrating element of the game, as your success is no longer just dependent on your skill.  Knowing what you need to do and knowing how to execute it count for little if your crate is bouncing everywhere and you're waiting for it to settle down enough for you to be able to place it.\n\nThe checkpoint system needs a revisit, as after a number of both purposeful and accidental deaths I've found that some of them are so close together I don't see any reason for them both to exist, while other segments go far too long without one.  The puzzles are well done on a theoretical level, however many of them have too many elements strung together that all leave zero room for error that they feel like they're cheating the player.  A segment towards the end of Ep 1 is rife  with these, where if you fail it on the first shot you die, or if you don't complete it fast enough on the first shot you're stuck and have no way to escape the situation other than resetting to the last checkpoint (which of course is waaaaaaaay back at the very beginning of the sequence).\n\nTo add insult to injury, holy glitches Batman.  I believe I spent more time raging at the bugs than at the unforgiving death puzzles.  I actually had to complete the last segment of obnoxious puzzles I just talked about three different times, because the first two times I completed it the cut scene that is supposed to trigger didn't do so correctly, and the game thought I had died. Not only did it reset me to the beginning of the segment, but actually to the checkpoint BEFORE that, and somehow also simultaneously broke the physics. I had to completely exit out of the game to get the correct physics back, then do everything all over again.  And then again.\n\nI want to like this game, and I'll probably play Episode 2 in the hopes that maybe the issues that plagued Episode 1 are a fluke, but as it stands I can't recommend this game.","November 1, 2015","false","3.8"," 74 of 86 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","74","86","6","4"

You are armed with a gun, and a stuffed rabbit, named Otto. While Otto is on you, you have special abilities like levitate, double jump, and a shock. You can also place Otto down, and use the abilities remotely to help solve your way through the levels. Both Albert and Otto must survive and stay together to progress.\n\nPros:good puzzle aspects with having to place and use Otto's abilities\nthe background music and sound effects were enjoyable and fit well with the atmosphere of the game\nkeybindings and resolution options are available in pre-launch menu, as well as controller support\nthe colour style with black and white, with the red splashes works really well, both simple and elegant\nmonsters and boss fights bring extra excitement and challenges to the game\nCons:the story was told through child's drawings, and it wasn't as clear as it could have been (some animation would have been more effective)\nphysics sometimes makes objects you're levitating bounce around too much, and then go flying\nlots of deaths if you aren't good at timing your moves (especially on boss fights)\nI prefer the puzzle aspects over the timing platformer type of gameplay, but it was still an enjoyable game, and a great start to the series. I died quite a bit on a few levels, so the game took me about 3 hours to complete, but I can't see replaying it unless you want achievements. I will definitely pick up, and play the next game in the series when it becomes available.\n\nFree giveaway of this game here: http://www.steamgifts.com/giveaway/omEYR/albert-and-otto","March 7","true","4.2"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

I recently replayed Limbo and Never Alone, and really wanted something similar to get immersed in. Unfortunately, this game does not have the stylistic low-graphic art style that Limbo does so well, or the genuine connection to the protagonist found in Never Alone. It's biggest downfall, however, lies within its gameplay mechanics.\n\nThe controls feel quite clunky, and for a puzzle-solving game, it is incredibly unintuitive. It also has its fair share of bugs. As it is pretty standard to die a number of times whilst solving a puzzle, it is really unhelpful when one of the cogs you're meant to be pushing somewhere decides to get stuck at an angle, or fly off altogether. Obviously, dying in games is all par for the course, so it shouldn't actively make you angry, but this game pulls it off in a way I've not experienced since the early Tomb Raiders (which gives Albert and Otto far too much credit). I have no problem in dying to learn how I'm meant to solve a puzzle, but when you decide to make a level insanely precisely timed and then give the player buggy, tempermental controls, which sometimes choose to just not work at all, and then punish the player by making them die repeatedly and reload in a far off checkpoint, then you are not designing games well.\n\nI love indie games, and really appreciate what a tough industry it is, and I honestly wanted to enjoy this game, and stuck with it long after I had begun to lose my patience. Maybe, with some more work on the gameplay, it will achieve what it set out to do, but at the moment, I would recommend trying Limbo or Never Alone.\n\nAlso, being mysterious and telling a story through (honest to God) children's drawings is not compelling or new, it's just confusing af.","December 15, 2015","false","4.0"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","15","22","2","0"

Objects are contrasted nicely with a silhoutted 2D presentation much like LIMBO. Albert and Otto's puzzle solving sequences are some of the best around, with large multiscreen mechanisms requiring multiple actions to solve. The Albert and Otto dynamic itself lends itself to some sharp creativity and timing needed to work through these puzzles. There's not much in terms of story, but more in terms of breadcrumbs leading the player to a bigger picture it seems. For $4.99 this game offers tremendous value and a good addition to anyone's Steam collection, but especially for platformer fans eager for a stiff challenge.\n\nWhat drove us batshit insane\n\nRrrrrr *throws controller* ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ spik#@#!!@!!! Falling down the !!! RRR!! AHH... ok you get it. Some of the ultra elite platforming skills with almost no checkpoint sections are excruciatingly difficult.

I was a huge Limbo fan and with that I have high expectations for other platformers. The art style and graphic details are really impressive and I love the music. As another reviewer mentioned the music is very chilled at times. The relationship between Albert and Otto and the extra abilities Otto provides you are very well done. When ever I had to put the bunny down I felt incredibly weak.\n\nHowever this isnt a game for Novice Platformers, it is very unforgiving in parts and doesnt handhold you at all through the numerous puzzles. I love platformers and am not pro by any means but I am stubborn. I did experience a bug or two along my journey but nothing that stopped me from progressing. There is a lot of trial and error with many of the sections where you have to die multiple times in order to figure out what to do. But I prefer this to a game that I could complete in a single playthrough without dying at all.\n\nI played/streamed this for 4.5 hours yesterday and didnt quite finish episode 1 yet but I am close. Probably around 150-200 deaths during this time with close to half of them happening on one very long sequence that takes 3-4 minutes where you can not make 1 single mistake. During this section you also have the most chilled music playing in the background which made me wonder if it was intentional to soothe the rising frustration levels.\n\nThe main criticism I have would be for the game to have extra checkpoints (Especially during the above mentioned section I spent over an hour on). I can definitely see people rage quitting this game at points and this is just the first episode.\n\nOverall I recommend the game to anyone who is an experienced fan of platformers knowing that the game is not a cake walk. I would suspect many players relatively new to platformers may not last an hour without giving up.\n\nI am looking forward to completing the game tomorrow and waiting to see what upcoming episodes bring.","October 29, 2015","true","7.5"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jacmusl/recommended/368590/","jacmusl","Zip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jacmusl/","1424 products in account","Disclaimer: The review key for this product was provided by the developer free of charge.\nCheck out this review and others at Nouse Gaming: http://www.nouse.co.uk/muse/gaming/\n------------------------------------------------\nIt’s like LIMBO, with guns. This is a comparison that I’ve seen a couple of times, and immediately thought of myself. In truth that’s a pretty encapsulating statement. The gameplay of Albert and Otto is almost exactly the same as LIMBO but with more intricate mechanics, i.e. a gun. I’d like to try and avoid the comparison to LIMBO but it’s such a strong resemblance in feel and theme that I had to double check to make sure it wasn’t some kind of sequel.\n\nFor the few of you who haven’t played LIMBO or at least don’t know anything about it, Albert and Otto is a puzzle platformer. Set in a mostly black and white world you play as a child with a ‘large head’. You move through the creepy landscape going after some abstract goal that you don’t necessarily understand and along the way, you die. Brutally.\n\nThe controls are for the most part very tight and easy to control and even in the places where time is short you rarely mess up a jump. You push and pull boxes, press switches and try and avoid falling on spiky things. So far, so standard. The way the Albert and Otto stands out is through the use of the titular Otto. Otto is a stuffed rabbit that you find fairly early on. Whilst you hold him you gain the ability to double jump and move objects telekinetically. However you can drop him which will allow him to be used as a long distance switch operator or as a weight on pressure pads. It’s these added mechanics which really allow for a varied puzzle experience that in my opinion surpasses that of LIMBO’s.\n\nThe game also features a couple of boss battles and both of these feel great, perhaps not as memorable as LIMBO’s infamous spider but still great. And what’s great is that neither of these rely on the gun you have. The game understands that it is a platformer and that your gun is just a tool rather than a weapon.\n\nThe game has a story, that much is clear. But as this is the first in what seems like will be a series nothing much is explained, and all you find are scattered across the world are hints and clues. It’s incredibly creepy and something bad is happening but you feel like you’ve only just scratched the surface. Wartime Germany is about the only thing I managed to figure out and I look forward to the next game so that I may find out more!\n\nSo where does it stand? If you enjoyed LIMBO you’ll love this game, it’s better in every just about every aspect and is about the same length (just under two hours). Thanks to the addition of more intricate mechanics there are far more options for the puzzles and despite the difficulty spike at the end I enjoyed it a lot and eagerly await the next game.","December 5, 2015","true","4.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

The style of the game is remiscent of Limbo but the game does a good job distinguishing itself. The best part of the game in my opinion was the puzzle design. While the puzzles aren't that hard, the game does a good job mixing the different mechanics in order to make interesting puzzles that don't seem like more of the same. The puzzles at the end of the game in particular are really well done.\n\nThe only significant problem I had with the game is the length. The game is only around three hours long and ends abruptly at the best part of the whole game. Since the game is just one chapter of a much larger story this isn't that surprising. The game ending abruptly did leave something to be desired with regards to the story though since the story so far in the game is not great.\n\nIf you like puzzle platformers I think you will really enjoy Albert and Otto. If you should buy it at full price or wait for a sale will probably depend on how important game length is to you. I know I am interested in seeing how the next chapter of the game turns out.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of the game from the developer but received no other compensation.\n\nRead My Full Review[www.geekyhobbies.com]","November 9, 2015","true","3.1"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

It literally puts you in situations where you have to purposefully kill your character because you've messed something up. That's bad design.

It was the intrigue surounding the story that won my patronage.\n\nI like:  The steampunk vibe in the landscape.\nThat Albert's gun has an oldschool sound to it.\nThe music!

(The pause menu music is my jam!)\n\nCriticism: sorry in advance. :/   (I'm writing these as i play through.)\nThere's a whole plethora of small bugs.\n\nBoulder bouncing off big robot pushes player as they try to jump the gap.\nWolf cage,  magnetic sky trolly, after death, reapears where player left it on last play, while the heavy safe returns to  its original spot.\nFor the number of times I'm dying, the check points need to be shorter. I'm getting punished with having to redo a bunch of time consuming requirements just to reach a single very difficult part of the check point where I die many times. But to have another go at the difficult part I have to redo all the tedius tasks before it, again and again.\nOk. I've got to float a 3d crate on the water & stand on it in order to reach another 3d crate with my telekenisis.  But the 3d crates are damn near impossible to stand on in the water; they rotate soon as i stand on them. Also again, i'm haveing to invest about a minute each time on the preparation to get the first crate, just to get a chance at experimenting with it.\n\nAfter walking away for a while to calm my nerves, I still can't finish this bit with the crate in the water.\n\nPlease let me know if I'm not suposed to use the crate & i'm just an idiot for not getting the puzzle lol\n\nOtherwise the crates need an urgent patch to make them stable.\n\nWith sincere intentions,\nA patron\n\n{One day later}  I was just an idiot for not getting the puzzle lol,   This game is intensely punishing, I haven't felt this punished since dark souls!","October 28, 2015","true","7.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","4"

Honestly, for the first few minutes I was in awe of how perfect the mood felt in this game. Aside from the beautiful soundtrack and environments, you're going to find puzzles of varying difficulty. What's unique about this game is that some of these puzzles really force you to think outside of the box - something that can be hard for puzzle platformers to accomplish. You really need to understand all of the things you can do with your abilities and how they can be used in the environment.  The most rewarding thing about this game though is the thrill and excitement you get from completing one of the boss sequences. After finishing the episode in about 3  hours, all I can say is that I'm still hungry for more and bring on episode 2!","November 6, 2015","true","7.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I am afraid there is more to the story because this red bunny encloses magical abilities” - CutieRoo\n\nThe first thought that came to mind when I first laid eyes on this gem-of-a-game was *oh great another indie game that is similar to Limbo…*but I was wrong! The game in itself brings its own charm and heart. Nothing of the sort of limbo’s design and style that has been introduced. While playing Albert and Otto, I noticed some of the ideas that were implemented were their own and that helps separate itself from the other indie games out there. Such as, the ability to use a magical bunny that gives you powers in order to help solve the obstacles you come across. The other positive thing I noticed is despite some of the puzzles being a bit repetitive, the achievement of completing the puzzle is always different leaving you feel accomplished and interested.\n\n\n\nAs I mentioned before, a few things that stood out for me that helped make Albert and Otto its own game is the cute-little-red-magical-bunny and the ability to use a shotgun. Now these two items will be used throughout, and will be necessary to progress forward. With each puzzle you come across, you will be using your little furry friend to aid you in solving them; giving the game an appealing twist compared to some of the other puzzle platformers I have played. Plus, the shotgun puts an enjoyable influence on the game *Plus! It helps to eliminate any foe that comes your way*. However, this is the only weapon provided to you, and no other weapons will be given *for now*.\n\nIn terms of story-line for Albert and Otto, I found it to rather intriguing through the way it was told. As you progress, the story-line unfolds when you visit your mail box and read the mail inside. Now this doesn’t implement cut scenes. It’s just a letter you focus on and learn more about what is happening with drawings that the mysterious girl sends.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the next thing that I wanted to discuss are the graphics and artistic style of the game. The quality of graphics was taken into a new direction compared to most indie games that try. In this case, they do catch your attention and was a great idea to try because it succeeded in how it did stand out. The artistic design almost follows the path of Limbo but has more attention to detail that gives it a very tasteful style. It ties in well with the obscurity and gloomy design, but not as ominous as Limbo where you don’t know what is going to come out to kill you next. I feel like the music helped in aiding this very well to help contradict that dark and scary vibe.\n\nThere was a drawback for me when it came to playing and that was the contrasting between white and black. There would be moments where I would be playing and the character would blend into the white color and completely disappear or make it very hard to see him.\n\nAnother one of the pleasant moments of playing Albert and Otto was the music they created for it. It was very pleasant to my ears, and flowed very nicely to each changing environment or situation that may happen as you progress.\n\nIn conclusion, I found Albert and Otto to be a very delightful and creative game even though it was rather short leaving me with wanting more. Fret not though, this is only episode one of the Albert and Otto series and more is set to come in the future. KBros has made a well-rounded game that is full of potential to become even greater than it is now. I am beyond excited to see what is in store from them with current development of this series and other games in the future from KBros. If you are a fan of the puzzle platform style games, this is a game that I definitely recommend to add to your list to play when going through the vast collection of Steam games available.","January 6","true","22.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

The controls didn't felt that good like it should be in such games. At least the checkpoint-system is okay.

As many others I've grown tired of the puzzle platformer genre as there's just so many of them these days. Most of them not being terribly interesting. Yet Albert and Otto managed to keep my interest.\n\nA good mix between puzzles that required some thinking - although never difficult enough to stop the experience from feeling fluid - and some puzzles which require precision. The game tells its story through letters presumably from the girl to Albert which also serve as checkpoints. They're very kid like which is nice and describe her life as Albert attempts to catch up to her.\n\nTo be honest I didn't like LIMBO myself. It just didn't hook into me. This game did though. And I like it a lot. It's very short (about 2 hours long) but it's worth a playthrough. The music is excellent and the art style works really well (some observant might notice the color choices along with where the game takes place...).\n\nI look forward to the rest of the series.","January 24","true","4.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

If you like a challenge, definitely check this one out.\n\nThis game does not hold your hand so you´ll need a bit of patience to figure out certain puzzles. When you do solve them however it creates a very satisfying & rewarding feeling.\nThe different special powers you get throughout the game only work when you're holding the bunny 'Otto'. This makes the puzzels extra challenging at times but adds to the feeling of satisfaction when solved.\n\nThe music and art are beautiful! Both create a mysterious & darker atmosphere. When the music changes (or fades away completly) you´ll quickly learn something is going to happen.

There are loads of bugs, from dropping through the world to complete changes in the physics engine, and a spike in difficulty around 90 minutes in changes it from a casual platformer to one of the most needlessly-frustrating titles I've played in recent memory.\n\nThe whole thing can be finished in 2.5 hours, with one of those hours being dedicated to two ridiculously difficult puzzle areas. There are shards to collect that don't do anything and are never explained. There's no plot, or even any dialog for that matter. I even beat the final boss stage twice and died (by falling through the level) instead of the game triggering the end-game cinematic.\n\nI played this back during the preview stage, and even though the game has far fewer bugs now than it did then, it's still one of the worst games I've ever played.","November 5, 2015","false","4.5"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

It wants to be so much like Limbo it hurts itself in the process. The visual design is great, the characters are good, the almost-out-of-touch-with-reality storytelling is something I've always liked, and the music provides a superb underpinning to the atmosphere.\nSo, when the presentation is so good, what can go wrong? Well, the game. The controls feel hamfisted, which is a big problem in time-limited situations - that's bad enough when puzzle platforming leans towards the platforming. But the biggest issue is the puzzle design, which ranges from the (very occassional) brilliant through the (very common) uninteresting to the (also quite common) horrible. As always, the really bad puzzles are compounded by the lack of control accuracy, making the game difficult by it's shortcomings and not the cleverness of the creators. I spent 10 minutes with the river sequence towards the end of the game, and decided to stop. With the controls as they are, it's just not fun.

The aesthetics, the music, and being a genre that I enjoy very much should have made this a highly enjoyable experience.  Unfortunately a lack of polish, harsh check-pointing and a punitive learn-by-dying approach to game design has soured the positives.\n\nThe lack of polish is most noticeable with the platforming and levitation system.  Getting stuck on geometry is frustrating at the best of time but when - especially in the latter river sections - demand a high level of timing it's less forgivable. In may other punishing timing intensive platformers (Super Meat Boy, Rayman Origins, etc) I've always known that the issue has been with my ability to learn the required process, not with factors that seem outside of my control.  Which brings me to the checkpoints in the game. Playing minutes-long sections of a game to then die because of the glitching gets old, very quick.  In addition, many sections of the game face you with traps and enemies in a fashion that's highly unlikely you'll be able to react in time sufficiently the first time you encounter them, sending you way back to the beginning of the section.  I can handle learn-by-dying games but not when the polish is lacking and the checkpoint system doesn't support it.\n\nWhich is a shame because as I started out saying, the aesthetics and the music are absolutely wonderful.  And what they were trying to do with the gameplay is a solid idea, which should have meant a highly enjoyable game. If you can deal with the issues that I've mentioned and it's at a good price it's worth playing for the experience.  Just be prepared for frustration.\n","January 5","false","6.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"
