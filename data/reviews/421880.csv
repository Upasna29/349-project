"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/421880/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","OMG! It’s modern Lemmings!: When I graduated primary school (elementary school for those of you in North America) my Christmas gift that year (school year runs Jan-Dec due to the  seasons being changed in the southern hemisphere) one of the very first games that I became addicted to was Lemmings. I loved that game. The entire premise around Lemmings and the cute way in which it was represented was everything that a near-teen could want in a puzzle game. You could play it properly and beat it or you could be sadistic and watch them die mercilessly. Plastiland brings much of the charm that I had in Lemmings back in spades and does it well.\n\nBeautiful art work: There is absolutely no doubting the quality of the handmade art work in Plastiland. It took the artists\ntwelve months to produce the high quality artwork that you see in the game and it absolutely delivers. Plastiland is very pleasing on the eyes and is a joy to play as a direct result.\n\nNice soundtrack: It would have been a great pity had the soundtrack behind the game failed given how beautiful the artwork is. However, it’s catchy and never feels as though it becomes too repetitive or boring. In fact, I’d like to see Zillion Whales add the soundtrack to the Steam store preferably for free but if they even asked for a dollar or two more for it it’d be worth the added price.\n\nIt’s not as easy as it looks: Plastiland offers players greater challenge than what one would initially appear. The tutorial is brilliant as it teaches you all of the basics that you need to successfully play the game. However, from that point on there isn’t a lot of hand holding and the solutions are often not as simple as they look. This is a really good thing because it means that everything else that is great about the game doesn’t go to waste.\n\nPlease add achievements: Puzzle games without Steam achievements have quickly become one of my gaming pet peeves. There is no reason whatsoever that your game should lack them and every possible reason to gain from having them – especially when you factor in global achievements. They allow you to know what your player base has done in your game and that in turn will give you ideas on what you need to improve in that game and what things you can do for your future games.\n\nPlastiland isn’t the greatest puzzle game ever made and it doesn’t pretend to be. It is, however, a beautiful game that will appeal to people of all ages and offers something for everyone. Don’t be surprised when your six year old finds the solution to a puzzle before you.\n\nFor more reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 17","true","6.5"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","22","30","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cojoha/recommended/421880/","cojoha","cojoha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cojoha/","2342 products in account","Intro\n\nPlastiland is a side-scroller puzzle-platformer that combines creative clay graphics, playful bouncy music, and a challenging yet open level design to deliver an engaging experience that will surely captivate puzzle-platformer enthusiasts.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics are akin to a sort of clay animation like you’d see in Wallace and Gromit. That’s where the comparison ends though, where Wallace and Gromit may appear as bleak and bland in terms of the colors, Plastiland’s colors are bright, cheery, optimistic, varied, and heavily contrasting. I thoroughly enjoyed the graphics, it was a trip down memory lane yet a refreshing experience that diverges from the graphics in many puzzle-platformers on Steam today.\n\nSound\n\nThe sound is pretty cool to me, it was probably the biggest surprise of the entire game to me. The music is fun and playful – reminds me of the type of music you would hear at a state fair. It definitely adds to the overall atmosphere of the game. The sound effects are another strong suit and happen to fairly accurate. For example, if you let one of your spheres hit the ground, you hear a “SPLAT!” and it correctly corresponds to the splat that you see on the screen.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe gameplay is fairly straightforward. The player must guide a finite amount of spherical creatures that are constantly moving from Point A (A Green Pipe) to Point B (A Red Pipe). The player controls these spherical creatures by changing them into a variety of forms in order to get them past a variety of obstacles in the level.\n\nThere are eight forms to be exact. The first form is the Roller, which is the main character. The second form is the Bomber, which disrupts and explodes in the environment after 3 seconds. The third form is the Crusher, which makes a vertical passage. The fourth form is the Crawler, which can crawl up on any wall. The fifth form is the Blocker, stop any other ball. The sixth form is the Builder, which expands to make a passage. The seventh form is the Chewer, which makes a horizontal passage. The eighth form is the Jumper, which can fall from any height. The player starts with a limited number of uses for each form. Each use allows the player to change one sphere into that specific form. The number of uses for each form varies and changes depending on the level which is where part of the challenge comes in. You have to make lemons out of lemonade.\n\nThe gameplay requires you to think outside of the box and repeat levels constantly.\n\nThe final note that I would add for the gameplay would be that beating levels is sort of similar to the ultra-popular mobile game “Cut the Rope” – the more spheres you get in the red pipe, the higher number of stars you will receive upon the completion of the level. You can receive anywhere from 1, 2, or 3 stars upon completion of a level.\n\nOverall Thoughts\n\nThis is a great little under-the-radar game as far as I am concerned. It’s a puzzle-platformer that does its job well. It’s fairly original when compared to many puzzle-platformers, you’re not going to find that repetitive 8-bit or 16-bit retro aesthetic that seems to be all the rage on Steam these days. However, you are going to get a cheerful, optimistic atmosphere that is highlighted by a rich, warm soundtrack that permeates through your side-scrolling form-changing gameplay.\n","December 4, 2015","true","6.2"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fantis6/recommended/421880/","fantis6","fantis6","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fantis6/","2599 products in account","Plastiland is a puzzle-platformer game what can remind for us a classical Lemmings. Your goal in the game transport little clay creatures from the start point to the target point. For this you also should sometimes transform they to the other ones. This game can get a lot of fun for many hours for you,  and if you have little children,  I think  they will absolutely love this game.The game has a great tutorial, so if you go through it, you will know all features of each transformation, preparing you for the game. At the moment the game features 48 levels, but in the future there'll be even more. The graphics looks amazing, all elements of the game are handmade and all the creatures and  the game world are very cute. The music and sound are also really pleasant.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+many levels\n+nice musics an sounds\n+cute and beautiful handmade graphics\n+can be enjoyable for each and every age\n\n-achievements\n\nSo Plastiland is a nice puzzle game with unique handmade graphic. This game mostly for children’s, but can be enjoyable at all ages. At the moment the price may be too high, but if the game get a achievements and trading cards, the value can rise in a lot of people's eyes. If you want something for your children's, I think buying this game for them is a good decision.\n\n7.5/10","December 4, 2015","true","2.4"," 21 of 34 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","21","34","0","0"

I played every Lemmings game ever made - Plastiland is a lot like Lemmings but without the downside.  Too many of the Lemmings games had levels where timing was critical and clicking at just the right place at just the right time made for something that went from fun to frustration.\n\nPlastiland isn't like that, the frustration part isn't there.  It can certainly be challenging - many of the levels need some thought.  That's not just to get through, but to increase the number of your buddies that get to make it.\n\nThe slower pace at first seems a bit placid, but I soon found that it gave me time to think about what to do next without having to pause.  And you can always use the Fast Forward to speed things up.\n\nI don't think you can go wrong with this game.  It's like a breath of fresh air.

That's not necessarily a bad thing, but this game is not worth the $7.99 price tag. The game is quite clearly inspired by both Cut the Rope and Worms, both of which are highly entertaining games. There is not much depth to this game, however. It's a great way to pass the time, and can be entertaining at times, but I can't justify this game's price tag.\n\nIt's a very interesting concept, and if the developers were to go and add in more mechanics and more developed gameplay, this game would be a must-have at the price tag, but with a lack of multiplayer or a lack of complex game mechanics in general, I simply can not recommend this game. It's a great concept, I just wish the developers would do more with it.\n\nIf you're a fan of Cut the Rope or Worms, pick this game up on sale. It's a great homage to both of these titles, but it just feels... unfinished.\n\nI received this product for free, in order to give my opinion of the game to the developers. I want them to know that I do enjoy playing the game, but it feels very mobile-oriented, with the mouse controlling most of the game, leaving no room for the keyboard to be used. A lack of controller support also prevents me from giving this product a reccommendation, as this game would be so much more playable when i'm lying around using my controller to play this game on  my TV. I'm including a link to a YouTube video to showcase some of the gameplay for this game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu8xenz4fT8\n\nApologies for my voice in the video.
