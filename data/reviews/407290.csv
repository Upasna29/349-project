I will give any game that does this a thumbs up, but I will not recommend this game. It's a solid platformer, but it's just bland and boring. Someone who's fresh to the genre will not appreciate this game, because it has nothing to offer to them. Just for nostalgia sake, older more experienced gamers will pick up this game, most likely play it to the end in one sitting (~2 hours) since it's easy, predictable and short, and then forget about it. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=604744492 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=658626981 Unlocked all achievements!","April 3","true","5.1"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","18","18","0","1"

You can double jump, swing your weapon, dash, and throw different projectiles that you find.\n\nI found that the game did a very good job at shaking things up throughout. Different enemies force you to react accordingly, as well as the levels themselves having different ways of playing. Underwater levels, dark levels, or even flying on a pterodactyl all keep the game from feeling stale. As well as changing up the obstacles, you can use a variety of projectiles, which all act differently and can be used in different situations.\n\nAlthough, I'm very happy with the difficulty of the game, it's worth noting that I haven't found a way to get a game over screen. You just respawn from the latest checkpoint, which keeps the game from getting frustrating. You have a limited amount of health, however, if you find secret health upgrades or purchase some from the store, you can increase that limit. Once you die though, they're gone. Which drives you to play very carefully.\n\nOverall, I really liked the game! It takes a lot of elements from the good old games we enjoyed, and leaves behind the frustrating elements from some of the others.","October 8, 2015","true","3.4"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","21","27","3","0"

It was super effective!\nGreat addition to the pixel genre and a good (rage inducing) plattformer.\nDeveloper: Nauris Amatnieks\nPublisher: Nauris Amatnieks\nRelease Date: October 8th, 2015\n\nStoryLet’s take it straight from the store page:\n\nThe world has been overrun by dinosaurs. The last living caveman, is left alone in his cave, with every other living thing he knew dead. But he does not want to give up the world to these ferocious beasts. So with what little hope he has left, he will venture out of his caves, to find the only thing, that could save the world as he knows it - A female specimen to rebuild the cavemen civilization. But doing that won't be easy as the world is full of these dangerous creatures and other deadly hazards\n\nThe things one does for love … amirite?\n\nGameplayPretty retro. Pretty oldschool. Pretty good. Pretty hard.\nFor the sake of this review we’re going to call our caveman Chuck. Pretty dope name!\nChuck’s starting with just three hearts. Whenever he gets hit he loses one heart and there are two ways to replenish health. The first one is by finding a red heart, which are pretty rare. The other way is by finding or purchasing a golden heart which will not only full heal Chuck but also give him another heart container.\n\nSo anyway. Chuck’s able to do certain things such as:\nThe Chuck Smash! He’ll just smashes stuff with his mace. The dude’s pretty hard core after all!\nThe Chuck Leap! Like a bird he jumps into the air and, if you don’t mind me saying, he looks rather fabulous in mid air. You’re wondering why? Well I’ll get later into it.\nLast but not least is the Chuck Dash! Chuck’s using his caveman power to dash a short distance be it while running or jumping, that’s how awesome Chuck is!\nI mean afterall he’s the last living caveman so it’s safe to say that Chuck’s the real og in this game.\n\nBut that’s not all! Chuck’s even able to use the bones of his enemies, well the bones that are lying around to be exact, to throw them at everyone that dares to stand in his way. But bones are not the only thing that he’ll be flinging at his foes. Stones and other various things are at your disposal to make short work of your enemies.\n\nWhenever you kill an enemy he’ll drop some skulls and those are basically your currency. Again just goes to show how bad ♥♥♥ Chuck truly is. He even uses the skulls of the enemies he’s slain to buy himself throwing weapons or even a golden heart.\nTo sum it up there’s a lot of stuff going on in this game.\n\nLet’s talk about the world.\nEvery level in there’s a caveman is unique and offers you a new challenge. And how unique they are!\nYou’ll fight your way through caves, forest the inside of a dinosaur and you’ll even have to beat the afterlife! Only Chuck could face such challenges for he is the last living caveman and a real badass! Hell the guy’s even able to breath underwater and fight against a giant octopus!\n\nAudioThere’s just one thing that bothers me or well did bother me the first few minutes when I was playing and that was the sound you make when you jump. I don’t know why but I found it really irritating and that’s pretty much the only thing that I didn’t like. Other than that the music and the sound effects are solid and remind us of the, what I like to call, golden age of gaming, the NES/SNES era.\nAnother positive aspect is that every level sounds different. Some effects did sound to me like they’re being reused but to be completely honest it didn’t bother me.\n\nVisualsOnto the best part of the game. The best thing about There Was A Caveman is by far the art style of the game. The pixel art looks just incredibly good and I love how much detail went into Chuck. Remember earlier when I talked about how fabulous he looks while jumping? That’s because his hair and his manly beard are even animated. This just shows how much love and detail has been put into making this game.\n\nI have to say that I have two favorite levels in the game. The first being the afterlife level (rip) and the second being the gut leven aka the inside of the dinosaur.\nThose two levels really caught me off guard and I found them to be the most interesting looking and packed with small details.\nOverall I really enjoy the look of There Was A Caveman and it’s awesome to see yet another great looking pixel art game on steam\n\nWinkKudos to Nauris Amatnieks for putting himself into the game .. winking.\nReally liked this little detail.\n\nWhat else can I say?I have been lucky enough to get a Review Key for There Was A Caveman in order to write a blunt and honest to God Review. Just as usual.\n\nThere Was A Caveman is a solid pixel art game and a great addition on steam and to the genre. The plattforming is well done and you find yourself dying numerous times because you were unable to make this one precise jump so you’ll have refrain from biting into your controller. Or well I know that I had to stop me from doing so more than once.\nYou can do nothing wrong with buying this game. Really nothing. It’s quite enjoyable, despite the game trying it’s best to literally ♥♥♥♥ you off, and a solid purchase.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\n- Neku","October 12, 2015","true","5.3"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","3"

Plenty of clubbing, rock-throwing and spear chucking!\n\nUnfortunately, it's pretty rough around the edges. Hitbox-issues, floaty controls (not being able to map the digipad on Xbox controller does NOT help) and some rather unfair and annoying leveldesigns, generally difficulty being all over the place - it turned out to be more frustrating than entertaining.\n\nPresentation and sound could also be better, personally - I am not a fan of the undetailed visuals.

If I am allowed to indulge in delicious foods in my afterlife (rather than the maggot and feces stew I hear they serve in hell), I will probably eat pizza every day for fifty mortal years.  Some people don't like pizza that much, but I don't care about those people, nor their disgusting tastes.\n\nNow, viewed through my paradigm of platformer-as-pizza, There was a Caveman is a scrumptious artisanal pie with all one would expect from such:  a savory strata of gourmet cheese that strikes a perfect chewy-to-gooey ratio; toppings including locally grown mushrooms, crunchy bell peppers and freshly caught shrimp; organic Genovese basil; tangy, yet not overly salty, sauce that bespeaks of the heirloom tomato that birthed it; and a buttery, hand-kneaded crust that would be delicious bereft of all else.  Undoubtedly, it is a pizza, and you can easily imagine its primary flavors before you bite, but it's a superb specimen of its kind and a true delight for the pizza-lover.\n\nSpeaking less obliquely, one might say that the game plays smoothly, has a consistently high framerate on fullscreen, provides intense yet fair challenge, and exhibits finely etched hitboxes (I tested them on the pendulum grubs in the forest -- you can safely stand in the trajectory of their short swing until they actually  touch you).  I could also talk about the wonderful consistency of the jocular pixel-Prehistoria aesthetic.\n\nBut I'd rather just see it as a damned fine pizza, served up by a lovelorn Cro-Magnon.","April 25","true","3.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","86","6","7","11","0"

However, there are quite a few blatant problems that hold the game back in some areas. I'll be going in depth on them, but honestly, if you like quirky action platformers, pick it up when it's on sale.\n\nFirst off, while I'm sure this is rectified with controller support, there are too many buttons to play the game smoothly with a keyboard. I hardly ever used the "dash" move, simply because it felt to unintuitive with the keyboard. I don't have a controller to play with, and it seems like this was designed with controller support in mind, so take this one with a grain of salt.\n\nThe music ranges from forgettable to annoying, and it seems like that mainly has to do with the "retro" style of it. If it used synthetic instruments instead, I feel like it would be more bearable at parts. But as it stands, certain areas made me mute the game due to the soundtrack giving me a headache. Another minor nitpick, but it seems to loop at weird areas that make it super noticable.\n\nThere are no lives in the game. When you die, you lose one of the extra hearts you may have earned and start back at the beginning of the current screen you're on. While this seems fine at first, there are some parts where the screen goes on for way too long, coupled with one hit kill spikes, which gets old fast. Speaking of the spikes, they appear often in levels, but only some of them actually kill you in one hit, and they don't look any different from the others. I feel if they each had a respective color, it would definitely be better in terms of design.\n\nThere are quite a few areas where you swing on vines in the game. While it seems like a fun idea, the vine swings automatically, and you can only jump off of it at the apex of the swing. I've also encountered a glitch several times where  the game auto locks me onto a vine for a split second, and then puts me back to where I was when I was jumping, but having lost all the momentum from the jump, leading to a frustrating death.\n\nIn addition, the screen scrolls in a way where you are typically vulnerable to obstacles before you can react to them. There are also places where you are expected you make jumps into areas that you can't fully see, with the OHK spikes on the ground. I feel like a lot of deaths in this game are due to no part by the player. While I tend to be a patient gamer, I feel like this would make quite a few players not pick this game up.\n\nMost basic enemies are simple and easy to work around, which is a shame because if this game was more focused on complex enemy design instead of platforming, I feel like a lot of the problems would be solved. The action parts are truly where this game shines. The bosses, while challenging, are still very fun and interesting. Being able to throw a spear and stick it to a wall to use as a platform is done geniously. The shoot-um-up segment was great.  If this game ever gets a sequel, I hope it takes a more "Metroidvania" style approach. I feel like the combat system and control feel would be greatly suited to a more action-adventure exploration focused environment, instead of a platformed with some action sprinkled in.\n\n\nBasically, here's what I feel could be improved on\n\n1.) Fix the vines. For comparison, if it was more akin to the rope swinging in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, it would feel smoother.\n2.) On longer screens, a checkpoint would be nice. Even if it's out of the way, and a challenge to get to itself.\n3.) Make it obvious which spikes kill you in one hit and which ones just harm you. A simple palette  swap for one is all it needs.\n4.) The screen should scroll faster\n5.) The player should be able to hold down to recenter the camera and see what it below. Instead of hitting down to jump off certain platforms, change it to down and jump.\n\nAlso, I just want to give the game major props for the atmosphere. It's very subtle, but it works sooooooo well.\n\nLike I said before, this is clearly a well made game, but if I was a teacher, I would put a "Needs Improvement" on the top of this assignment in big red ink. For what it is, $7 seems like a tad too much. I haven't beaten it, but I think that if you can get it on sale for less than five, that's probably about what I'd say to spend on it. Keep in mind that this is all meant to be constructive criticism. I took the time to write this review not out of spite, but because I feel like this is a good game that could be amazing with a little fine tuning.","November 27, 2015","true","3.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I'd recommend this to you if you are prepared to deal with a bit of frustration.\n\nThe game does a good job of trying to mix things up, it does all the platformy gimmicks like a level where you have to stay on a moving platform and dodge things coming from underneath, or a boss that gets a stronger attack when you've almost killed him (I'm at the final area right now and only one boss seems to have done that), and overall has a lot of elements that could make it a great game, including a level that is essentially a side-scrolling shmup like that old alien shooting game on nokia phones.\n\nUnfortunately a lot of little issues come together to make the experience less than ideal.\n\nFirst off, the way that jumping handles in this game is a bit jenky. The first jump works fine but the second jump throws your character in whatever direction he is facing which can sometimes cause your character to get tossed into spikes or other things when you are doing jumps in certain areas that require you to double jump and probably get hit by said spikes.\n\nAnother issue is hitboxes. Your character's hitbox is a bit weird, sometimes you will get hurt by things that are clearly not touching you and when you jump you have to get much higher than it looks in order to get onto platforms. There have been platforms where the character very clearly is able to jump higher than the platform yet is unable to land on it because the hitbox is a bit off so you are required to take a different path there.  This problem is at it worst during one of the earlier levels where you have to swing across vines in certain areas. You are only allowed to catch onto the vine if you hit it right at the tip which is weird in and of itself but when added with your character's slightly off hitbox it can mean a lot of dropping into an instant death when, visually, your character should have been perfectly fine,\n\nA lot of the difficulty in this game actually stems from little issues like this and not actual hard platforming. In the aforementioned section, where you do the whole moving platform across a river of acid or toxic water or whatever, you basically have to stand on the platform and dodge the balls coming from underneath. The big issue with this is that there is neither an animation prior to the balls launching up at you or a consistent timing for the balls. One or the other would have been fine but without both it means your character is at the mercy of the random intervals since you can't actually use timing or visual cues. You can help this to some degree by standing all the way at the back of the short platform and running past the ball the instant it launches then running back (provided you aren't in a bit with 2 balls launching which can seriously screw you over if one decides it's going to resurface in half the time it generally takes). But this strategy gets compromised by flying enemies going at your head that you will have to attack, this wouldn't be an issue at all but when your character attacks he mysteriously stops where he is on the screen while the plaform keeps going so you may end up falling into the acid which is an instant death because your character does something illogical only on that bit.\n\nThe game attempts to make boss fights easier by letting you find golden hearts that increase your max hp (you start with 3). The issue with this is if you die you will lose the extra hearts. With the combination of most deaths being instant and there being next to no regular hearts for you to pickup (enemies don't drop them and on some levels they seem rarer than golden hearts) the odds of you making it to the boss with the extra hearts is very unlikely. Now let's say you do make it to the boss with the extra hearts, it's gonna come at you and with how easily your character dies you will likely have to fight it a couple times in order to get the patterns down. That is standard with these games but it also makes the extra hearts you might have had when you first encounter the boss virtually worthless and is furthered by certain points which are clearly designed to kill you the first time you enter them because of the surprise which makes anything you picked up (or even purchased immediately before that screen) pointless.\n\nArtstyle is pretty basic, wouldn't say it's good or bad. The music ranges from certain tracks being very good to one that is  actually quite annoying given some time.  The main issue pretty much all the music tracks have however is that they weren't designed to loop. There is a very obvious start to the tracks and since it loops right back to the beginning when a track ends it creates very abrupt transitions which does break the mood quite a bit.\n\nThere are probably about half a dozen other issues that I won't get into yet but yeah, this game has potential but it definitely feels clunky as hell.","October 8, 2015","false","4.0"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","18","33","3","10"

Feel free to give it a try if it's platforming you are looking for and when it's low on Steam.","October 18, 2015","true","4.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

All in all a solid game, however it rubs off as a one time playthrough making the 7 buck price tag seem a bit steep.

I'm only three levels in on the world map, so keep that in mind. I will have a full review posted when I get a little further in.*\n\nA lot of people are going on about the graphics, but I feel the pixel artwork is a bit flat and unimpressive overall. Effective, but not the most memorable.\n\nThe controls are pretty good, though I wish like hell it worked with the directional buttons on my gamepad and not just analog stick (found myself using a mock-PlayStation controller instead of my preferred X360 one). The jumping is definitely a pain in the ♥♥♥ at times, especially during the start of level 2 reaching certain ledges, but it's manageable.\n\nInfinite lives kind of kills some of the tension, though. Instead you lose half the skulls you find each death. There's small shops you can buy things at once per stage, which is handy, and often still work with how few you have unless you are terrible at platformer games in general and walk in with less than three. There's also the "secret" golden heart locations, and was cool with losing one upon death as an additional penalty given the aforementioned issue, making reaching the boss without dying something to strive for.\n\nThe story is fairly basic, really, but level progression can sometimes be kind of cryptic. In one stage I found what looked like a hidden away stash of throwable weapons, using all to defeat a triceratops, only to find I screwed up and needed the woode arrows to reach the ledge you have to climb in order to finish the stage.\n\nNot the most unique 2D platformer, but still worth checking out. I find myself tackling this one as more of a casual experience thanks to the level save/select option, especially given the checkpoint system being at the end of one part of a certain level on the world map. I recomend it if you enjoy classic side-scrolling platformers like the titles mentioned above.","January 7","true","1.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are problems with almost every aspect of how the game flows, from your maneuverability, player and enemy hitboxes and the patterns within levels. A good game provides a challenge you can overcome and learn from, but if a game is challenging because of poor design, you end up suffering for something out of your control. Beyond that it is a standard sidescrolling platformer with a distinctive motif and deficient plot, but I don't see myself returning to play.","February 14","false","2.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I almost didn't even bother activating the key, because I am not a huge fan of pixel graphics, and don't like most platformers. Still, I decided to try it, because it had dinosaurs!\n\nI was expecting something similar to Bonks Adventure(A game i LOVED), but it wasn't anything like that. That's not to say it was bad...It was alright by my standards. If you are a pixel graphic fan, and love platformers...most likely this will be one of your favorite games!\n\nThe game is challenging, but mainly because I kept mixing up the buttons on the gamepad...I would frequently dash instead of jump....I'm not sure exactly why I kept mixing the games buttons up.\n\nOverall, if you see it in a bundle....Activate it! You might enjoy it...If you see it on sale cheap, grab it....otherwise I wouldn't plunk down 6 bucks on the game.\n\nRating: 5/10","December 6, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are solid, and it contains a few clever ideas, but it's mostly just frustrating, and mostly because of its stiff and unforgiving controls. It contains a super bad usability problem where if you pause the game, pressing the jump button exits to the menu without prompting (losing any progress within the level). I lost my progress to flawed muscle memory a few times because of this. You can collect skulls to buy items, but the items are fairly useless because unless you have already played through the game and memorized every trap, you're certain to die before you get to benefit from the item. (This mostly goes for the secret hearts, as well.) On the plus side, the boss fights were all pretty interesting and fun. The music sounds randomly generated, and the sound effects click like there's some 30HZ sine wave starting in the middle of its duty cycle. I played through it to the end, but can't really recommend.\n\nGames to play instead: Super Meat Boy, Super Time Force Ultra","June 5","false","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
