Or, as I like to call it, Locked Doors: The Game. Maybe it's just me, but the doors in this game seem a little hard to open. Having to save before every door is a given; having to reload a save because every door is made of titanium shouldn't be. When you finally pry the door open, you'll be treated to old school monsters like bats and rats that will dodge your every blow as they lay in gentle slumber. No worries, however, for if things get too hairy for you in the depths of this 1990s castle, your characters have the option to run away; which was the default operation of graybeard D&D players who cut their teeth on the 1st edition of the pen-and-paper game. Unbeknownst to you, however, is while you spent thirty rounds swinging in futility at sleeping enemies before they awoke to tear your hide apart, you were set upon by other enemies who ambush you as you run away. Whatevs, you think, I'll just run from them also. Well, when these monsters come to gangbang a party of inadequately-statted paper tigers, they come in droves.\n\nThen, inevitably, Death and his SoundBlaster call, as he stands over your tombstone. Yes, a single tombstone, because in the 8-bit era, your horde of characters are buried in the same hole, piled one upon another like firewood, except firewood is useful and characters in the game of Wizardry are not. But, you, my friend, are a true old school RPG fan, and you never give up. You spend hours rolling another party and head down into the depths, uneasy at the strange feeling that you are not playing a clone of Dungeons & Dragons but of the RPG Paranoia, where the Dungeon is not your friend and the assembly line of heroes who engage in suicide-by-bushwhacker is moving faster than that conveyor belt in I Love Lucy.\n\nYou will never give up, not until you beat this damned game. Because it CAN be beaten—can it? Or is this game like the module Tomb of Horrors, an exercise by game developers to assume the role of a merciless and antagonistic god, presiding over a world whose populace is comprised solely of doomed heroes fresh from the womb that see the gates of a hungry dungeon and shudder at their fate.\n\nAddendum: Apparently, there is a tool to boost your ability scores during character creation, which will save you the tedium of hours rerolling your team like I did. It isn't necessary, but welcome, especially on a subsequent playthrough.","December 17, 2014","true","25.8"," 67 of 73 people (92%) found this review helpful 69 people found this review funny","92","67","73","69","2"

The graphics are terrible, even by the standards of the time, their crude 16 colour EGA awfulness being quickly surpassed by the 256 colour majesty of Westwood's Eye of the Beholder, which followed but a year later.\n\nMoreover, in defiance of even the most slender of expectations, variation in tileset is extremely limited - expect to see castles, dungeons, jungles and mines rendered in the same undulating grey brick, with faded tapestries, rooms filled with rotting furniture and the stygian underworld described in bright yellow text rather than sprites. While far more attention was lavished on the animations of your enemies you should be prepared to see the same yellowish-greyish-pinkish tones portray a multitude of demons, rats, amazons, dwarves and dragons.\n\nThe sound too is also terrible, with no music to speak of and only a limited selection of digital samples to relay the clash of steel on steel, ancient enchantments and the death of your foes. Lest that sound too exciting, be warned this is a game where your enemies die with a bang, literally expiring like popped balloons. Indeed, this was a game where the sound was quickly disabled and the mouse driver not loaded, cursor keys and imagination being far better accompaniments.\n\nThe plot is borderline nonsense, but expansive and remarkably mature, if such a thing can be said about story involving adultery, murder, madness, a pen that can re-write reality and a half naked she-devil.\n\nAnd the game itself is unrelentingly punishing - this is the only game I can think of where your ability to access some of the more advanced classes, so temptingly described in the manual, at the beginning of the game rests entirely on a combination of luck and pig headedness.  It is also one of the few games I've come across where a party of six stalwart heroes can be bested within seconds of starting their adventures by bats, rats and weeds, where they can fail to pick a lock and find that door locked for good. It is a game where if one of your characters dies of poison then you better hope you have some means of curing them in addition to resurrecting them, because if you don’t they’ll only die again.\n\nHowever, if you've read this far and you consider yourself to be one of the few 'hardcore' CRPG gamers left out there, then you owe it to yourself to download this game and persevere. Nearly 25 years after its release, it stills holds the same dark attraction of stats and skills and spells and equipment and deep, turn-based, party-focused combat that for a few years in the mid-1990s seemed to represent the high point of aspirations for RPGs on the PC.\n\nOnce you’ve beaten the rats and bats and zombies and Zulus and taken on hell itself and battled through a climatic series of encounters against bosses that feel more like something from Streets of Rage 2. And once you’ve ditched the sticks and rags and found the Avenger and Maenad’s Lance and you’ve got a mage able to launch a tier six nuclear blast capable of incinerating waves of enemies at a time.\n\nThen you’ll have found yourself neck deep in that borderline nonsense plot, playing a game that never fails to keep you on your toes, that rewards intelligence and strategy and speaks to the same desire for challenge and depth that until recently games had somehow managed to neglect. You’ll be hooked and you’ll want to take that band of misfits you’ve so carefully tended for the last 40 hours onward to Wizardry 7 and 8 and the fact that you’ll have to spend more than 100 hours to find out there’s no Wizardry 9 will be a bitter-sweet pill to swallow, but probably one you’ll swallow all the same.","May 15, 2014","true","0.4"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","100","23","23","6","0"

I recommend it over the DOS version sold here since it has (slightly) better sound and graphics, except if you want to transfer your party from one game to the next. The SNES version has JRPG-style controls, too, and a simplified dialog system... which might be a good or bad thing depending on your tastes.\n\nLiked:\n- Designing, equipping and leveling up your 6-character party is just great\n- Combat is great with a great deal of strategy, many spells and character/monster abilities\n- Position of characters in combat matters, only ranged and pole weapons or spells and special abilities allow attacking from the back rows\n- Very good writing in the non-silly parts of the story\n- Nice sense of exploration\n\nDisliked:\n- Too many random encounters\n- World is a nonsensical patchwork of various mythologies, novels and just plain silliness\n- Dungeon graphics are boring, the DOS version has basically one wall texture for the whole game, SNES version has at least some variation\n- RPG system has some well-known exploits\n- The optimal way to play if you want the best party/items to carry over to the next game requires reading a lot of spoilers\n\nOverall the game grabbed me enough that I soldiered on until the end, but the overall experience left me slighly disappointed. Still, you can't beat that combat and party management, I really want more games in this turn-based style to come out now that we have Grimrock for the real-time side.","December 5, 2015","true","2.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

This game is one of the dated RPGs, just a dungeon crawl, a lot like some other classics back then (Bards Tale, Tunnels & Trolls etc.). This game was a real chalenge at that time, you needed to draw your own maps. You had to do searches on a regular basis, because some of the treasures were "invisible" or "well hidden". Of course there was no great and interactive PC/NPC interaction back then - but it already started to show some promise in that direction.\n\nIn that time it was a great game, but it really shows it's age now. Of course this shouldn't keep you away from a great game, that takes you back in time a real long way. It still can be a lot of fun to play old school CRPG - I loved the memories it evoked as I played it this time.\n\nOne good advice, Save your progress as often as you can. Sometimes the game has a tendency to hang up, and sometimes you'll be overwhelmed by a random encounter. You also need some time to make yourself familiar with character generation and learning what skills really are important, which race or class has which skills, attributes and perks. Also keep some boxed paper beside you, you'll might have to draw maps - some of them, or loose your bearings and sometimes your life because you ran into an already once triggered deathtrap.

Whereas the locked doors in-game require you to either repeatedly reload the game until probability takes a pity on you or fight against vast quantities of monsters until a group drops the right key, the sealed door to understanding the game mechanics can only be opened by reading though the game manual or spending hours of trail and error.\nAfter spending hours reading through manuals and guides, creating a party that has a chance to survive the first fights and opening doors the game confronts you for the rest of the time with only one tile-set. No matter if you are in the castle, on a mountain, in the jungle or on a river you will see cobblestone floors and walls everywhere.\nWhat is the appeal of the game you might ask. The highlight of this game is a sophisticated turn-based fighting system, still unequalled by many “modern” games, against beautifully designed monsters, considering the graphical limitations, interwoven with an interesting, engaging story.\nSo if the mentioned obstacles above don't discourage you or maybe even tickle your interest, grab a pencil and graphing paper, print out the manual and experience a highlight of RPG gaming.\n\n(Title is borrowed from 1st gameplay video of a Let's Play series of Wizardry 6 by DoctorPirx)","July 31, 2014","true","124.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I haven't really played much of the game itself. If (like me) you prefer to not use cheats you need to spend a long time rerolling your characters so you can get a high strength, and I mean hours. Since you need high rolls to unlock some classes (Samurai, Ninja, Bishop, Lord- which is just a Valkyrie but can be male and is kind of crap, etc.) and you need lots of bonus points from those rolls to up your carrying capacity (based on STR) which doesn't go up after initial character creation. Most of your rolls will be 5 to 10 when you need 18s and 22s.\n\nThat's after you've read the almost 200 page manual to get an idea of what kind of characters you need and will work. The game is very old school, the graphics aren't that great, there's no music (I assume the "6+7" soundtrack is actually just from 7) indeed there's very little sound at all aside from PC-speaker ambient noise and metallic clanks.

This is a genuine NES-generation RPG built to essentially replicate D&D on PCs not even powerful enough to run Windows 3.x...\n\nI'll be up-front with it: In this game, you start by building a party by rerolling virtual dice, sometimes for hours, until you get stats you can accept in your pre-planned growth strategy that will last the whole game before you even set foot in the dungeon.  If mashing a reroll button (which is made even less convenient by not letting you cancel out - you have to finish making a character before you can try again) to get the stats you want doesn't appeal to you, turn around, now.\n\nEven if you get attributes you like, you can still be screwed by randomly having only 3 hit points on a melee character in a game where a mere rat hits for 5 hp, you have full death on 0 hp, revive items and spells are extremely rare outside the late game, and even if you did, you PERMANENTLY lose 1 Vitality (on characters with an average of 10), which drops future HP growth.  Basically, if you take one unlucky hit, you have to reload.  (And there's no soft reset, you have to finish the combat or alt-tab and force-close the program...)\n\nTo stop this, you can try to use a sleep spell, and insta-kill the rats, right?  HAHA! NOPE! Enjoy missing against an unconscious enemy about 60% of the time, and then having about a 50% chance that your sword won't penetrate the "armor" of the rat.\n\nThen, you have the locked doors.  Highly random, and failure frequently JAMS the door, making it impossible to open except by magic or single-use keys that are rare drops.  At least reloading is faster, here.\n\nUnlike other D&D clones, however, skills are train-through-use, not unlike Elder Scrolls.  This makes many skills, like weapon skills, easily trained by merely hitting the target (not that such an event is at all common) while only a few require actually spending skill points on them.  In some ways, this is great, as it means you can power-grind characters all you want.  On the other hand, this means that the game basically just flat-out expects you to power-grind every skill to max fairly early on, and 100 points in a skill isn't necessarily going to mean you succeed.\n\nThat said, unlike Wizardry 8, there's extremely large room for multiclassing abuse.  This is a game that is more free-form about its character creation specs, and if you gained a single level as a bard, you can continue to train bard music then turn into a mage, take up some spellcasting, then go samurai to continue training as a singing, spell-casting, warrior.\n\nThis is also a game old enough that having all the women topless wasn't a major concern, the manual is written as if it assumes you're 8 years old, and rolling a female character means you take a -2 to strength, but, "That's OK, because women have a +1 to personality and karma!"  (Note: they're both basically useless. That said, the gender-restricted valkyrie class is generally worth it, anyway, and the caster classes don't need strength... unless you multi-class to a hybrid class.)\n\nIf the idea of ridiculous power-grinding appeals to you, and you don't mind savescumming 'till your fingers bleed, then maybe, just maybe, you'll be the sort of person that loves this sort of game.  I can't even explain why, it's just a COMPULSION.  You'll beat that lock next time! You are so close to making that spectacular ninja-valkyrie or psionist-monk!","July 16, 2015","true","16.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is a deep and wonderful RPG in many ways and although it is dated the basic story and the wealth of items and choices is still enjoyable. This is the pedigree from which games like Legend of Grimrock stem and while it isn't as pretty as modern incarnations it is still very atmospheric.\n\nThe RPG "simulation" is substantially more complex than what is common in modern games and that makes it necessity to read through the manual at least in part. Everything from attacks to spells have modifiers and classes have a diverse set of mechanics. This in turn means that some classes are weak and brittle until relatively late in the game when they blossom into excellent additions.\n\nThere is no hand holding and the assumptions you make when exploring will influence what ending you will get. The feature to bring the party forward to subsequent games is laudable and it was a novel experience when the game was fresh.\n\nI am far less enamoured of the next installment probably because the port to my chosen platform was hideously broken, sluggish and failed to include the party import but the "Bane" was installed for years on my PowerBook 165c, infact that old hunk of plastic still runs and this is still one of the games installed.\n\nIn summary at the current Winter Sale price it is well worth adding to your library just for the hell of it and just while playing enough to be allowed to review it I once again got stuck rolling characters to get that perfect race / profession combination. I find it especially heart warming that the copy protection is still in there even if it has been disabled, while I did own the game the tiny irksome nature of looking up codes lent me to learn some basic 68k assembly.\n\nIt is highly recommended that you set it to keyboard control only to save on some fiddly clicking as using the arrow keys is substantially faster,.","January 1, 2014","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is no easy reroll button. Create a character, sigh at his or her crummy stats, delete the character, repeat. I try to play with the first characters I roll, but I die a lot in the opening castle, so I spend a few hours creating a party of 6 elite adventurers, and then die a lot with them.\n\nWithout the option of rolling even higher stats, I resort to saving and loading the game constantly. Early enemy encounters can be fair or unfair; unfair encounters lead me to restarting dosbox and loading my last save, fair encounters lead me to a phyrric victory, followed by saving, resting, saving, resting, saving, resting, being surprised by an enemy, quitting, loading, resting saving, moving on. Locked doors can be successfully picked and opened, or jammed and forever closed. It takes an average of ten reloads to successfuly pick a lock-- all of the doors are locked; some locks must be left alone until later.\n\nThe grind doesn't end, but the feeling of helplessness does. After the first few hours of play, i experience a battle that takes all of my strategy, cunning, and items to beat. This victory is not phyrric. This victory is glorious. I am a thirty year old man who stands up and pumps his fist.\n\nWith a new confidence, I begin to explore in earnest. The levels are all mazes. They are all connected, so the world feels vast. The world is a maze. The world is a vast and beautiful maze that connects many smaller mazes. The vast maze sprawls like the tentacles of a giant octopus. The small mazes stack level upon level, doubling in on themselves and zig-zagging vertically. Navigating the staircases that crowd each level takes hours. On the screen, the world is endless identical gray, stone corridors. In my mind, it's a dark and forbidding world whose respect I am earning.\n\nSome very close boss battles later, each of which took many reloads and ended with a satisfied sigh of relief, I reach the Pyramid. Gone are the Pirates and Lizardmen and Jelly Clouds that populated the castle, and the mountain, and the mine, replaced by a Shamaness and her many subclasses. Native, Priestess, etc. They wear grass skirts and bare breasts. Each encounter makes me wish I could just complete this dungeon and forget that it ever existed, but even with a completed map, navigating the pyramid takes hours. Every time i encounter an enemy, I feel a little bit of my enthusiasm die. I have all the requisite pieces to continue now, but despite the nostalgia and child-like engagement ellicited by this game, I feel that perhaps the spell has been broken.","October 2, 2015","true","34.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thewizardkiller/recommended/245410/","thewizardkiller","The Chosen One","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thewizardkiller/","115 products in account","Wizardry... A legendary name for a legendary game franchise, created by two U.S.A. college students in their spare time, one can’t help but wonder if they thought or even knew that their game, along with the Ultima franchise, would shape RPGs as we know them today. Probably not. But they did, and whether they knew of the greatness they would achieve is no longer questionable, but one thing is certain: a particular video game publisher out there wants us to remember the fun times we had playing Wizardry (at least from Wizardry VI, the subject of this review, onwards) because we can now purchase them and play them legally from websites such as GOG.com and Steam.\n\nWizardry VI: Bane of the Cosmic Forge came to make our Dungeons & Dragons senses tingle way back in 1990 for the Amiga and DOS platforms. And for a game that’s as advanced as this one is, which is by the standards set in 1990, by the way, this game had a lot of cool features. A complex character creation system, skills that increased the more you used them, there’s more,\nI’m sure, but I can’t exactly remember them.\n\nGameplay-wise, the game feels like a turn-based version of the RPG known as 'Eye of the Beholder’. When starting out, you must create a party of between 2-6 members, and you can choose their race, gender, class, what skills they specialize in, etc. Now, I’m fully well-aware that in this day and age, most people prefer to play with characters who are based into the story, but for me, at least, this is a welcome change. After creating the characters that will be in your party, you then venture into the castle, where the Cosmic Forge is said to rest. Your party has to fight and build up their skills and experience by fighting life-or-death battles with rats, bats, rogues, and for whatever reason, moving vines. At times, you must use their skills to solve puzzles. It isn’t much, again, by today’s standards, but back then, things like this in video games were unheard of. Using skills, such as Search to find hidden things within the game’s world, could make the game easier or harder, depending on the skills you invested points into.\n\nIf you came here to see what music you can rock out to while playing the game, you... are totally S.O.L., my friend! The only “music” you can hear in this game is what sounds like the flapping of wings and something banging around on walls. And even then, you only hear it when you’re standing still. Now, when you hit enemies while you’re in battle, you’ll hear what sounds like a weapon of some sort hitting something else that’s metal, but it plays no matter what enemy you hit, regardless of whether or not they wear armor. Again, that’s just a small nitpick of mine, it’s not a make-or-break deal. At least, for me it isn’t.\n\nGraphics are actually very-well developed. You can tell what monsters (with a few exceptions) are of what type and in the inventory, you can tell (usually) what type of weapon is what, based on the name and item icon. And while the tilesets in the game are good-looking as well, be prepared to see them A LOT.\n\nUnfortunately, I can only in good conscience recommend this game to Hardcore Dungeons & Dragons fans. Or, to someone who has the patience of a saint for all of the grinding you’ll be doing throughout the game, and believe, you WILL do quite a bit of grinding if you want to get even remotely close to the end of the game.","November 12, 2015","true","96.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Spend the extra time rolling characters. Spread it out in 20-30m bursts over days if you want. I like to have the following:\n\nLord, maxing strength if possible. (No switch intended. Late-game ebony, mantis, etc will ensure super low AC)\n\nNinja, with enough extra points to assign stats for a guaranteed profession switch to Samurai when needed. Allows maxed Kirijitsu by late game. (One game I made this a super-ranger who went ninja at level 8).\n\nSamuri or Monk, with enough extra points to assign stats for a guaranteed profession switch to Ninja. Allows maxed Kirijitsu by late game. Have one Samuri by or after Hall of the Dead, so you can equpi Murusama Blade. Second-best weapon in game (to Excalibur, which pretty much never drops).\n\nRawulf priest with stats to change to bishop at first profession change. Rawulfs can always switch back to priest because they start with 12 PIE.\n\nMage with stats to switch to bishop at first profession change. (I like elf because 10 INT, 10 PIE, making priest-mage switching very easy)\n\nMage with stats to switch to bishop at first profession change. (I like elf because 10 INT, 10 PIE)\n\nOne mage should pick Knock-knock at earliest opportunity to address lack of thief.\n\nI make all casters into ninjas before or after entering the Enchanted Forest (last 'zone') and equip them with the best ranged weapons I can afford (ninjato / cat o' nine tails, depending on available gold). At that point, you can trigger fights at the Temple of Ramm by approaching without a mask. You'll get 2-5 groups of melee-only enemies. Just read your book while holding down return, and your party of 1 Lord and 5 Ninjas will wipe them out methodically.\n\nOver the many many years, I have come to the conclusion that you should only play alchemist/psionic if you want extra spell points, or an extra challenge. Their spells are weak and more often resisted in comparison to mages.\n\n\n2. Profession switches at ideal times. Your casters should switch around multiple times, in a staggered rotation to make sure you have at least one to cast max-lvl iceball and another max lvl fireball.\n\n\n2a. Waiting at spell point regeneration fountains (L3 in Mines, outside Hall of Damned, inside Hall of Dead) and deliberately generating fights. I like to find a corridor near to these locations, and strafe left/right on the keyboard with one hand while reading a book; can keep one finger a tiny bit above the other relative to the keys and you can rapidly switc. Glance up once every half-page to see if you've met an encounter. Time will fly because you're reading, meanwhile, you are generating a tremendous amount of exp for the brief periods you're paying attention to the game (during the fights). Fill up on spell points inbetween fights or groups of fights instead of resting. You will accumulate an incredible amount of spell points, and way more HP than a caster usually has this way. But it does take patience.  This also generates a ton more gold than you would normally get.\n\nThis is particularly advisable because top tier spells (ie, Asphyxiation, Nuclear Blast, Death Wish, Word of Death) do not work in the Steam verison of Bane. A fight with five groups of monsters that might be knocked out with a blast or two instead takes 10+ fireballs. Etc.\n\n(SERIOUSLY, fix that, please. I beg you).","July 19, 2015","true","175.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
