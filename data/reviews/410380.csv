It's free - try it!\n\nHEX is a digital trading card game done right, embracing digital mechanics and having robust tournament support.  PvE modes are fun, rewarding, and accessible, but expect a significant grind to play PvP as a F2Player.\n\nHighs:\n- Magic the Gathering (MTG) players already know the rules\n- Unlike MTG's digital offerings, HEX embraces mechanics that are only possible with digital cards\n- Unlike Hearthstone, HEX is a complex game with considerable interaction between players\n- Robust tournament support, including synchronous Limited that fires regularly (<hourly) and asynchronous Sealed\n- The RPG campaign is unlike anything I've played before (working on my 6th clear atm...)\n- Best community I've ever seen!\n- Devs clearly love the game and have a number of awesome features in the works\n- All cards (and other items/currency) are easily tradable to other players\n\nLows:\n- Auction house is tedious to use - I tend to stick to "trade chat" transactions\n- Takes about 10h to grind a draft entry fee as a beginner - I'd recommend spending $10 on drafts to jump-start your collection and speed up the grind","April 19","true","3.7"," 217 of 243 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","217","243","5","9"

Here's what you need to know about this game:\n[Along with a TLDR answer for each question]\n\n1.) What is Free to Play in this game?\n[Many hours of PvE]\nPvE is RPG-meets-TCG content that allows you to have fun, learn the game and farm cards and in-game currency at a decent rate. You can also play the auction house, and tournaments will start paying for themselves once you are good enough. A small investment goes a long way to make the grind more enjoyable.\n\n2.) So how much do I end up paying in the end?\n[From $0 to $1,000 and beyond]\nYou can enjoy the majority of the game by grinding and trading for what you need. But if you want to compete at the highest level of tournaments, like the $100k invitational, a large collection will be a long-term advantage. It may cost you a lot, but it will gain value over time and can be resold!\n\n3.) Is this like Magic: The Gathering?\n[Similar concept with different strengths]\nHEX has a great online experience, uses its digital nature to innovate, has a growing RPG PvE and is easier/cheaper to get into, but it's not as vast as MtG yet and lacks its face-to-face social interaction.\n\n4.) Does this have a good community?\n[One of the best around]\nIt's easily among the most helpful and generous I've encountered, and the streamers are fantastic. The official forums and fan-sites are informative and active with guides and great tournaments.\n\n5.) Can I trust the developer?\n[Yes!]\nThe company is designing their own dream game. That is why this is a AAA quality game, despite coming from a still growing Indie studio. This sustainable perfectionism can lead to longer wait times, but they are worth it in the end.\n\n6.) Should I play this game?\n[If you are looking for a long-term game, yes!]\nThis is not an instant gratification game that presses your reward center a couple of times and then leaves you wanting. TCGs are one of the most rewarding genres you can get into, allowing you to grow your skill and collection over decades with flexible time and money commitment. You wont regret giving this a try.","April 19","true","311.4"," 147 of 160 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","147","160","2","0"

Have been playing before the game was released on Steam.\n\nHex is a true digital TRADING card game (TCG). Whether you are new to the genre or someone who has played many TCG's before, it offers a huge amount of gameplay. Jumping in is free and you can play through the single player campaign to get a hold of the basics of the game without spending a dime.\n\nBesides that the game offers a lot of PvP activities like Draft and Constructed. Note that those option will cost you, just like other TCG's.\n\nThe game has an in-game auction house which allows you to sell and buy cards, as well the option to mail cards to friends. This is almost unique in digital card games and a huge plus compared to other games.\n\nFor now; Jump and try out the game :)","April 19","true","100.3"," 139 of 160 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","139","160","2","0"

As a beta era mtg player, 2+years on hearthstone, I can safetly say this is one of the best tcgs/ccgs I've ever played so far and I've only gotten into the pve campaign! It is worth a try if you like card games in any form. The addtional mechanics of talents, charge abilities, equiptment (pve only), really makes the game stand on its own as a fresh game.\n\nThe way the economy is player run and the easy selling of in game currency for real money curreny makes obtaining the decks you want relativley easy for a f2p system (and thankfully pricing is fair) compared to others....cough....hearthstone...cough...sorry bout that, something stuck in my throat.\nI cannot wait to start trying out the different tourtaments they have set up (you can pay to enter or join in the constant free ones) the prizes and way you get to keep all the cards you draft. Not to mention any cards you buy from the store or win in tourtaments have a 2% chance to spawn a bonus "Primal Pack" that contains nothing but legendaries and rares which either sell by themselves (the packs) for a lot of the real money currency, or you can open them and hope for a super rare legendary and be set for life $$ wise :P\n\n\nAlso note, I saw all the negative reviews due to some server issues, earlier today the devs made a statement about it, found the problem, and have since fixed it. Not at any point during my 9 hour spree did I suffer from lag, disconnects, or game crashes. So ignore the mixed status as of now and the negative reviews going on about lag and disconnects, its been fixed and the devs showed great passion for their game by their fast answer and fix. Their quick response has given me a lot of hope for the future of this game, I can definetly see myself playing it for years to come.","April 24","true","55.8"," 89 of 107 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","89","107","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Enyeez/recommended/410380/","Enyeez","Enyeez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Enyeez/","409 products in account","Feature Review\nWhat is Hex?\nHex is a Trading Card Game (TCG), not unlike things we've seen before.\n\nWhat makes it different?\nHex was originally marketed as an MMO/Card game, and while it's not there yet, it is becoming one with each major content drop.\n\nWhat do you mean MMO/Card game?\nWell, for your PvE experience you will pick a race and a class. You are given a deck containing basic cards, and then you are encouraged to go explore the adventure zone(s) to collect cards and equipment; or you can improve your skills against players and try to be among the best.\n\nEquipment?\nYes, Hex has equipment for your character, equipment that change what cards do, when you can play them, or what they cost.\nThe equipment is specific to your cards, so you pick and choose what equipment you want for the deck you are currently playing.\n\nThen we go explore?\nCorrect, when you get into the game you can choose to run the capmpaign, the arena (PvE) or any of the many variants of PvP available.\n\nPvE?\nThe campaign, has dungeons to be beaten, and loot to be found. You level your character, pick your talents, and upgrade your deck.\nIn the Frostring Arena, you are faced up against a list of 20 opponents with a single deck, and three lives, changing bosses and a hidden random encounter keeps it very fun, and rewarding.\n\nPvP?\nThere are several ways of playing against other players:\nSealed deck\nDraft\nConstructed\n\nSealed and constructed can both be played as a live tournament, or as a gauntlet tournament where you can play until you have 5 wins, or three losses, and in both then you get rewarded according to how well you did.\n\nAnd, all this is free?\nWell, the game has two different currencies, platinum and gold.\nYou can acquire gold from the PvE experience, or by selling cards, chests, packs, mercenaries or equipment on the auction house\nWith platinum, you can buy packs, starter decks, and entry to tournaments, and is obtained by purchasing it from the store, or by selling your above mentioned items.\nDepending on what you want out of the game, it can cost you money, but you can certainly try it and enjoy it at no cost at all.\n\nIs it worth my time and money?\nThat's really hard for me to say, but as for time, it is certainly worth mine. Concerning your money, it's not like you need to throw down anything to give it a try, so I would say yes on both accounts.\n\nTo sum up, PvE is free, and you are rewarded with cards (both PvE and PvP) as well as equipment, and dust to upgrade the art on the cards to extended art, all of which can be sold to other players for gold or platinum.\nYou can play against players, and if you are good, and hardcore enough to attempt it, you can try and compete in tournaments for good prizes.\n\nCard packs contain a single rare or legendary card, a few uncommons, and quite a few commons up to a total of 17 cards, when buying or winning packs, there is a chance that it will generate a PRIMAL PACK that will contain 2 legendaries, and 13 rares.\n\nYou can construct as many decks as you would like, with as many colours and cards as you want. And you get to pick the champion yourself, there are quite a few, and only more coming.\n\nThe game is very promising, the digital-only design space opens up some very interesting mechanics, from as generating new cards, or shuffling cards into your opponents deck, to permanent buffs and cards with sockets.\nContent is being released at a rather slow rate at the moment, so if you join early, you have a good chance at catching up.\n\nTournaments are run weekly, and there are monthly VIP tournaments that reward alternate art cards worth upwards of 15$ each, and the entry fee is much less, but you do need to have the VIP entry tickets.\n\nThe game comes with a tutorial, and the community is very helpful.\n\nIt may seem overwhelming at first, but start by jumping into the ever expanding campaign, and venture into the world of PvP once you feel like you are ready.\n\nI have played the game since alpha and even now, the special encounters, and race/class rewards in the campaign keeps you coming back for more.","April 19","true","345.9"," 60 of 66 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","60","66","0","1"

Being able to build assets for the time you invest in the game makes this game one of the best values for your luxury time.\n\nPvE!!!!!!!!!! and endless deck building possibilities through equipment!\nThe AI for HEX is awesome, and keeps getting better. The RPG elements and leveling system offer a lot of variety, and deck building options with PvE exclusive cards and equipment will offer endless replayability! The content release plan is said to have 7 years of content currently planned, with 2-3 anticipated large PvE content and progression patches per year. The experience is extremely unique for a TCG, and will eventually have co-op MMO style modes added.\n\nPvP is outstanding and the constructed and limited format scene are developing nicely with each new set.\nThere is a draft format, sealed format, and constructed format where packs are rewarded as prizes. Including some free community tournaments as well, where packs and plat are rewarded as prizes. Unlike other popular card games now, part of the cost of limited formats, like draft and sealed, is in the packs, which you keep all contents of after the tournament. The constructed format has a rich meta that has evolved with time, and will get better with each set release.\n\nMarketing Model knowledge is an important step to appreciating the value HEX provides.\nWhether it be Primal Packs(and you will love these babies), Chase cards, Exclusive events, Hitting an amazing chest spin, or trading your gold for plat to remain a free-to-play player, there are a ton of intricate pieces that tie into the Marketing Model for HEX, that really reward you for your understanding. At the end of the day, 1 simple rule applies - Time = Money, but if you put in a little bit of Money to jump-start your experience, it can save you a ton of time grinding early on. If you want to be a virtually free-to-play player, with it comes an understanding to build a strong PvE deck, and having the time to farm gold, and then convert gold and cards on the AH to continue playing all modes for free. F2P is definitely something that can be done, and the better understanding you have, and the more time-invested, the easier it will be for you, as a player, to casually drop 1400 plat in a day to play paid limited tournaments, and convert those rewards.\n\nFuture Development, and other bells and whistles.\nThere are a lot more formats, PvE content, RPG experience, MMO experience, cards, equipment, exclusive events to come. This game is seriously a black-hole of replayability, and for that, I both love it and hate it, as it's hard for me to put the same value into other games, and I find myself spending more and more time playing HEX for both the value and fun experimenting with endless options.\n\nWhat is HEX up against? - Genre competition - Scope?\nFaeria / Hearthstone / Duelyst / Duel of Champions - Fast and fun games, but all CCG's - you can't trade, and they have poor AI and poor PvE modes. 100% limited to cards for customization. Dumb-downed mechanics.\n\nMagic the gathering - This is grandpa's TCG, that refuses to iterate for the digital age. The digital nature of HEX is constantly being pushed, with permanent buffs, and sockets, etc. Things MTG never could do. The price point is twice as much, and your time does not feel as valued. Their PvE titles leave a lot to be desired, and they don't have a cool equipment system.\n\nPlay HEX! You won't regret it.","April 19","true","483.1"," 60 of 67 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","60","67","0","0"

The PvE content gains you rewards in the form of PvE cards + packs as well as valuable equipment to augment your cards, and gold (the ingame currency) all of which can be used to trade for PvP packs and cards on the auction house which would normally cost a small amount of money.\n\nThe community is great, the developers are great, and above all the game is great.  In addition to all that, the current content is only a small fraction of what is set to come in to future (think guilds, co-op dungeons and raids, even more MMO aspects, etc.). While the game isn't completely where it wants to be yet in terms of projected content, if you're willing to be patient it has huge potential.\n\nDefinitely give this one a try!","April 20","true","141.1"," 79 of 98 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","79","98","0","1"

So in my review I will focus on a very specific demographic.\n\nHi there, long time Magic: The Gathering players! The answer to your question is a massive YES.\n\nYES, this is that game you've been waiting for all this time. Frustrated about the fact that Wizards of the Coast is apparently stuck in 2002 (looking at you MTG Online) and you see all these shiny new digital TCG/CCG coming out? You've been looking at your humongous collection of cards neatly stacked away in a closet. And you nostalgically think about the times you used to play MTG for days with your friends. Friends who have since moved far away and don't have time to get together for this anymore. It's 2016 now, surely there could be some way of reliving the joy of MTG digitally?\n\nWell, it's time to rip apart that Chaos Orb! HEX is here and it will give you everything you've been waiting for and so much more! And that, my friend, is a promise. It's MTG, but with all the nice things you can only do in a digital environment.\n\nI've read people complain about the fact that PVP isn't free-to-play. Well, we, as long time MTG players laugh about this. Haha! The amount of money we spend over the years on buying booster packs and single cards will never come close to what HEX costs in a long long time. ;) But I think this is one of the things I really like about HEX. Why?\n\nNo, it isn't F2P if you really want to get competitive into the PVP side of things (but PVE is totally free). But that's also why HEX is a Trading Card Game. That T actually makes a huge difference in comparison to other digital cardgames (one with Murlocs for example). You can buy, sell and trade single cards in HEX. Just like you can with MTG. There is an actual auction house and there are third party store websites, which buy and sell singles. So, yeah, you can buy that booster pack for $1.50 and pull out a Vampire King, which is currently valued at $30. You can then sell that Vampire King and buy yourself a stack of boosters or a couple of other singles you want. The money I spend in-game is actually more of an investment. And not a bottomless pit even Harrison Jones wouldn't dare to venture down in...\n\nSo, bottom line, I can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone looking for the best digital TCG currently on the market. Look no further, it's HEX. And if you look at the things these guys have in store for us in the future, this is only going to get better and better.

I played for about four years but I was never that hardcore. I still have a shoebox in a closet with about 4-5 decks I think. Anyways, I played Hearthstone some and it was OK. I only played it for 5 months and have paid about 8 bucks or something. More or less worth it but I just didnt like the game enough in the end. To be fair, that is a pretty easy game with a noob-friendly enviroment.\nThis game however is the exact opposite. The PvE expects you to pay attention and play correctly (rng screws you sometimes as to be expected). The AH and All the menus are very harsh to my mind when I first poked around. This game is serious and expects you to respect it as such. Now I just have to decide if I want to get back "into the game" as it were. I can completely understand anyone touching this game and saying "woahhhhhh". Is the game good? Hmm... so far I would say yes. Though I feel that there is a little more to be done with bridging the gap for the newer/noobish crowd.

Since I've only been doing single player activities, I'm not going to talk a lot about the PvP aspect of the game (which has very little in common with the single player stuff, save the cards you use). Read this with that in mind.\n\nI tried to type up something long winded, but it felt awfully pretentious and had tons of pointless information. So I'm going to condense it down into the good and the bad for ease of reading. (It's still a bit lengthy though. Sorry.)\n\nThe good:\n\n- A good single player experience through the campaign. While hard to do, it can be beaten with your starting out collection, and you can earn gold, cards and equipment for free. It's done RPG style with quests, and there are dungeons that boast some very dangerous boss opponents. Think of it sort of like the Hearthstone adventures, but f2p and with replayability (you get cards and gold every time as opposed to just the first time you win). Having access to 8 different races and currently 3 classes is a nice touch as well, as it gives you lots of options to cater to your preferred style of play.\n\n- The card game can accurately represent what it is like to be caught unprepared by a throng of hungry piranhas. (It's painful, yet mercifully brief, in case you wondered)\n\n- The game has a good level of visual polish. Good artwork, little sound effects to go with every card that's played\n\n- Another good single player experience in the arena. You're using the heroes you'd be using in PvP games here, so it's much harder to win the harder difficulty tiers. But you can grind gold here at a decent clip, and there's enough variety in opponents that it won't feel like the same thing evey time.\n\n- It's a TCG. You can actually buy from/trade with other members of the community for packs and cards, even with the f2p earnable currency. You can also buy the premium currency from other players, again using the f2p currency\n\n- If you can get a deck that performs consistently well in the arena, you can make it a true f2p experience as you'll be able to grind gold efficiently and start to work on the pricier aspects of the game. It will take some time and probably the shameless copying of someone else's deck list to get here, but it can be done.\n\n-If you choose to drop $$$ on the game, you can buy the cards on an individual basis and make a strong, effective deck without spending a fortune on packs (though some cards, naturally, are super expensive anyway. But that's the nature of a TCG)\n\n- The community so far has seemed pretty helpful in-game. It's easy to get some quick advice if you're stuck with something, most of the time.\n\nThe bad:\n\n- Entering tournaments asks you to fork over premium money, and sometimes a few card packs as an entry fee. If you do well you'll make your entry fee back and then some, but I find the lack of a f2p, prize-less option a bit dissappointing\n\n- You can't buy packs with the f2p currency from the game's store. You *can* buy them from other players that are selling them on the auction house, but obviously the price won't always be consistent.\n\n- The deck builder doesn't feel incredibly intuitive. There's no way to filter out stuff you already own, and it's not possible to search for cards of a specific costing or shard threshold. This makes it very awkward to try and work out what cards you'd like to work towards getting to go with the cards already in your deck. You can mitigate it somewhat if you're looking for specific keywords, but overall it feels like it could use some improvement.\n\n- The resource system can lead to the good old problem of mana screw/mana flood. I personally don't mind it, but I know it's a big turnoff for some people.\n\n\nThe verdict:\n\nOverall the game is very similar to MTG, but it has enough uniqueness to offset the familiarity. The PvP segment of the game seems difficult to get anywhere with unless you're prepared to grind for it or drop cash on the game, but it seems the developers actually care about providing a good single player experience (which is rare in card games) and I hear an extension to the campaign mode is in the pipeline somewhere.\n\nGive the game a shot, see what you think. If you like card based gameplay, I think this one can easily scratch that itch and at least provide a few hours of gameplay, even if you're unwilling to pay or grind. And who knows, you may find you really like it. I did, and I wasn't really expecting much when I first loaded it up.","April 21","true","8.4"," 63 of 79 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","63","79","0","2"

Hex has been my main game to stream for over two years, and I would not cast a game for that long that I didn't personally enjoy. However, Hex may not be for everyone. Read on, and let's see if the game is something you'd be interested in.\n\nIf you are looking for a card game, where the primary focus on the game are rich and strategic interactions between cards, Hex might be a game for you. Especially if you enjoy deckbuilding and brewing. With over 1300 cards available and all sorts of effects and synergies spanning all its modes, there is already many cards to take in and explore. Though, if discovering cards and deckbuilding sounds like a chore, perhaps it isn't for you.\n\nIf you enjoy card games, and like to compete against other players, Hex might be a game for you. The PvP is modeled like many competitive Trading Card Games in its tabletop roots. A small entry fee and some luck and skill can turn into awesome prizes. And at the highest level of play? Perhaps you'll win a qualifier and play in an Invitational tournament in front of an audience for a large cash prize! But if you don't like PvP play, this won't be a compelling reason for you.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, if you don't like the pressure of competing against other players, and just want to play out your amazing combo, Hex also has you covered. Its single player PvE play, in the form of a RPG-inspired campaign to explore and grow your own champions (that will be expanded upon in the coming years!) and an Arena mode to take on a gauntlet with a fully-geared deck. An experienced player should find about 10 hours for a single once-through playthrough. Cards, equipment, gold, loot to gain, and this is all free! But some aren't interested in single-player modes, if that is you, then feel free to ignore this section.\n\nDo you like collecting stuff? Does the prospect of turning extra things into stuff you want sound compelling? The T in TCG stands for Trading, and Hex prides itself on its economy. The terrible feeling of getting an extra of an amazing thing, and being unable to trade it, is not in this game. Open a legendary in a pack, get a rare dungeon drop, or receive an exclusive promo in an event... and find someone who wants it in the Hex Auction House. Turn your extras, tournament winnings, farmed gold or bought platinum into anything you can find a buy or trade for. Though, if economy is not your thing, then it's not.\n\nWell, there's a bunch of reasons I have for liking Hex. If you've read through, and one or more of those reasons intrigue you, give Hex a try. It's free to make an account, the campaign and PvE is free and you get stuff, random PVP games are free, and you have full ability to buy packs of cards if that's the kind of TCG player you are.\n\nHex has given me over 2 years of fun, and will likely continue to. And if you're like me, you'll like Hex too.","May 2","true","317.6"," 57 of 71 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","57","71","0","0"

You will be sorely disappointed. F2P, especially in an environment with a living, breathing economy (i.e. TCGs, MMOs), means eventually you will either be spending some time grinding to get the things you desire, or spending money to acquire them. This is not a bad thing. A lot of people put in a lot of work to make this. They have needs (i.e. food, shelter, clothing) which cost money. If they just give away all their things, then they don't get money. No money = no basic necessities = dead developers = dead game.\n\nFor people with a realistic view of the world and a rational mind:\n\nThere are many aspects to this game. I'll start with the one that drew me in first: PVP. You see, in the early days of Hex, there was no PVE campaign. There wasn't an Arena. There was only PVP. Just to be clear I don't mean, like, the Alpha days (I was not around for that, though I've heard the stories and I admire the brave souls who made it through to Beta). I came across a Beta key just a few months prior to the release of Set 2. I had read a bit about the game some months before, so I had an idea what I was getting myself into. I had played TCG's before (several years of MtG on and off again since the mid 90's, several years of Yu-Gi-Oh more recently) and understood that this game would require some investment. At that time, in fact, there was no way to play without spending money. But I am a draft addict. And I don't mind paying companies for their hard work so long as I am satisfied with the result. And ohhhh.... was I satisfied.\n\nI drafted my way into a fairly decent sized collection of cards when the unthinkable happened - Set 2 released! I now had another 300 cards to collect and mash into random decks. I drafted and drafted some more, and in time I had near complete playsets of both Set 1 and 2. However, things at work had gotten complicated, life did it's lifey things, and I put the game aside for several months.\n\nComing back 7 months later saw many changes. First, a new set had arrived. A new set, and a new challenge in both drafting and collecting all the cards I could get my grubby average sized hands on. Secondly, and more alarming, the Frost Arena had popped up out of nowhere to tempt me with its F2P design and PvE loot. I tried it a bit (and still do dabble to this day) but for the most part I went full force into draft. And over the last several months managed to collect not only a complete playset of Set 3, but also round out my first to sets for PVP playset completion :D\n\nYou might ask: "So what do you do now that you've drafted all the cards?" I might (and will) answer: "I continue to draft." Not at the same 'gotta catch em all' pace as before, but still several times a week I queue up and mash random cards together and try and walk away with more than I put in. Sometimes I win, sometimes I lose. That's not the point. I have fun doing it.\n\nI also found a new love. Constructed. Now that I have all the cards, why not use them? Especially when there are community sponsored FREE tournaments with actual rewards? So, I start playing around with decks, watching others, absorbing all I can. I fail several times, but I learn in the process. I eventually find a deck I like in the $100k tournament and tweak it to my own liking. I enter yet another weekly tournament. Eight rounds later I sit back and wait for the mail to come in with my 10,000 platinum. I, a commited drafter, who for so long ignored the constructed queues, had just gotten first place in a free tournament (single elimination; 140+ contestants). I had just won $100 worth of in-game currency.\n\nDid it require some investment? Yes. Money and time. A fair amount of money, and a TON of time. But, like all good things, that investment payed off. Not just in the form of resources. I've made more friends playing this game than any other in the 5 years since I've built my PC. I've had more fun learning and playing this game than any other in the last 10 years (with the possible exception of Minecraft and CoD: World at War).\n\nThe thing is, I'm a gamer. Not just video games, all games. Board, card, pen and paper, dice, whatever. Sometimes I want to shoot things, sometimes I want to sit around a table with my friends for 4 hours claiming I'm not a cylon, sometimes I want to throw cards at people. This game allows me the freedom to scratch that TCG itch whenever I get it, and I don't have to leave the house. I don't have to convince everyone I know to play it. I can just play. And if I take a few months off here and there, that just means there's that much more waiting for me when I return. I will return, always and forever. I <3 this game.\n\nIf you're still reading, I suppose I'll get out of story mode and on to a few other points. This game can be F2P, and if you aren't interested in the competitive side it is in fact VERY F2P. No money required whatsoever, and spending money would do you little good anyways. What's good in PvP is not necessarily good in PvE, and some cards that are junk in PvP are actually quite powerful with the addition of equipment. All this and more can be yours from running the Campaign and farming the Arena.\n\nThe MMO aspect of this game is still in it's very early stages. It, like all MMO's (and TCG's really) is a WORK IN PROGRESS. If you don't like that (and really, I get bored fairly easily with the PvE content) then set it aside. Allow it some time to properly mature. Do you think WoW was built in a day? It's been through at least 3^14159 updates, patches, and dlc's. This is a very unique experience, and as such they are still working out the kinks and coming up with new ideas. I haven't really played the campaign since the last couple of patches, but when I did I had some serious issues with crashing. I was not the only one, but I know I was one of the worst. I didn't let it kill my love for this game. I understand it is a WIP, and has a lot of potential. For the time I'm generally wrapped up in the PvP portion of the game anyway (especially with Set 4 literally 1 week away). I will come back to campaign, and very much look forward to all the new content they have announced (and the many surprises I'm sure they have in store).\n\nOne last thing before I end this rant of a 'review'. This game has the greatest community I've ever had the privilege to be a part of. Within the first couple of hours of being on I had been given a hefty amount of cards (for free) from a couple people in general chat. One of them invited me to check out there guild (guild support is not yet implemented in game, but there are several up and running outside of it). I checked it out, and couldn't have been happier that I did. I mean, as great as the overall community is, the friendliness of the people I have the pleasure of calling guildmates is beyond compare. I highly recommend that, should you find you enjoy the game (even a little), you take the time to talk to people in general chat. Check out the streamers on Twitch.

I am happy to report my experience so far has been great. The game does have a grind that you do need to get through before you can start to enjoy drafts with other people, but I'm looking forward to trying them when I get the chance. However, here are my pros and cons with the game.\n\nPros:\n- Game does an alright job of teaching you the basics through a single player campaign.\n- Community through the in-game chat and on their forums are generally very friendly and helpful.\n- You don't need to pay real money to play, but you can if you want to accelerate your progress.\n- Deviates from the gameplay of MTG just enough that it isn't an exact copy and actually betters Magic Duels in some aspects.\n- Auction House so you can sell your cards to other players to buy others that you may need to build an ideal deck.\n- Tournaments running all of the time, so you always have something to do, provided you have the in-game currency for it.\n- Cool character system found in the campaign that allows you to give your character different abilities and perks as you level him/her up.\n\nCons:\n- Some server issues, but these can be overlooked, as they are a common side affect of releasing on steam to a brand new audience of people.\n- Developer could do a better job of notifying people if there is a problem, such as on the main menu instead of on their forums, it would help the noobs that are lazy find out what is going on.\n- HUD could be worked on a tad to make it more user-friendly for people that have not touched a TCG before, or have only touched one such as hearthstone. Don't make it like hearthstone where it's blatently obvious. I don't think the majority of users will like that haha.\n\nAll in all, this is a great TCG with a thriving community, and could get even better with a bit more work and care put into it. Also, a note to anyone bashing the game, it's just been released on steam to a new audience. Give it a week or two to be able to iron out any problems related to the servers. It is definitely worth a try as there is no price of admission, and who knows.... you may just find a brand new game to sink time into.","April 20","true","3.5"," 45 of 53 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","45","53","0","0"

And let's be honest, MtG online or the Duel versions are complete disasters.\n\nHex aims to fix that problem with online TCGs. It takes a lot from MtG and makes a true modern online digital trading card game. This is NOT Hearthstone and it will never be like it. In fact, this is what Magic the Gathering should have been online, but never was.\n\nThis is currently the best online TCG with an entirely free RPG campaign, full of dungeons and with character customization (hero choice, talents...). PvP is well balanced with the meta shifting often, especially when a new set is released.\n\nWith that said, be aware that being competitive in PvP WILL require money just like any TCG if you are not a good trader. Even if you can indeed farm gold in PvE and buy some cards from other players using that gold, the majority of top tiers cards will require Platinum (unless you are lucky and someone does sell it for gold). On the other hand, PvE is and always will be completely free.\n\nAs an example, I will give you my personal experience. I invested 10$ (1000 platinum) two years ago and my cards collection is now worth 80k platinum or ~6.5M Gold. That's about 800$ worth of cards I acquired through gold farming and smart trading on the auction house.\n\nAs a final note, I'd like to mention this game has one of the nicest online communities I have ever been part of.\n\nIf you like card games, you absolutely must try it at least once !","April 19","true","191.5"," 38 of 42 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","38","42","0","0"

Just the amount of different enemies (and their special abilities) make every fight unique.\n\nThe progression so far has felt very rewarding for a purely F2P player, battles can reward new cards, new booster packs and gold (with which you can buy cards in the auction house).

The game offers a great ruleset that allows a huge set of interactions, veteran card players are going to feel at home with familiar concepts like The Chain (The Chain in WoW TCG, The Stack in MTG), activated abilities, triggered abilities, combat and resource systems similar to MTG, and a lot of other things. HEX also innovates a lot in the digital space; modifiers on cards can be tracked throughout different zones (even in zones hidden for players, like your deck), cards can interact with zones without revealing/shuffling/searching or other shenanigans, effects allowing you to see cards in your opponents hand without them knowing, transforming cards into other cards, etc. etc.\nThe game offers a great PVP experience with both constructed and limited formats (draft, sealed), and as in classic trading card games, you get to keep all cards and packs obtained in these game modes which justifies the small entry fee. There is also a PVE part of the game that is completely free to play, at the moment this includes a campaign with character progression, talent tree, dungeons, quests, equipment, and card rewards.\nHEX has a superb economy with two different currencies: Platinum and Gold. Platinum is bought with real world money, while Gold is given as a reward in PVE. Entries to PVP tournaments has a small Platinum fee, but opening packs yields Chests which in turn needs Gold. This results in paying players needing Gold, and since everything is tradable the paying players lists cards and items on the Auction House for Gold, hence everything in the game can be obtained by just playing for free (however there is a lot of grinding involved to get the most expensive cards).\n\nAll in all, HEX is a great game with a great future!

The notion of playing a tradeable card game without physical constraints offered so many possibilities. Within a game, cards can acquire permanent effects, transform into something completely different, and be created and placed into your deck. You also get to do fun things not possible previously such as steal cards from your opponent's deck or hand, see your opponent's hand without him or her knowing, and placing cards into his or her deck.\n\nThe project is very ambitious and the team behind Hex: Shards of Fate has delivered very excellent player versus player and player versus environment gameplay.\n\nThe PVP scene offers diverse competition where the rock-paper-scissors battle of aggressive decks vs mid-range vs control is constantly evolving. There never truly is a single "best deck"; weekly competitions feature new, surprising decks constantly.\n\nThe PVE portion of the game features an exciting new way for TCG players to explore their creativity. Players can create their own heroes with special abilities that interact with their deck and their opponent's deck. Cards can even be upgraded with special equipment, creating powerful options for cards and combinations.\n\nFinally, enough cannot be said about the community of players supporting Hex: Shards of Fate. Whether through in-game chat or while participating in a streamed event, new players are always welcomed and often given assistance with gameplay, deckbuilding, and even collections.\n\nI'm looking forward to how both the PVP competitive scene evolves and the PVE story is told over time.

Mechanics. Largely based on MTG. Anybody who tells you differently is wrong. I mean, WoTC - the maker of Magic - actually sued Hex for being too similar. There were straight up carbon copies of cards from MTG to Hex (see: Murder, now "Kill" based on the outcome of the lawsuit). But the mechanics are fun so overall it's a plus.\n2. Some good innovative features on top of the MTG base that are made possible by the purely digital format.\n3.

Their original promise of PVE has largely fallen to the wayside with the revenue chase and as of now, 3 years since the kickstarter was funded, we have a reasonably fun adventure zone 1 and a frost ring arena which is just a sequence of matches.\n2. Questionable integrity: original kickstarter promised 30+ dungeons and said the game was almost finished and just needed 300k to polish it up - fast forward 3 years and less than half of what was promised is in game. The forum is filled with apologists that will downvote and troll you if you have anything negative to say about the game (likely what will happen to this review).\n3. Hitching their wagon to the MTG star - see lawsuit details.\n\nOverall: Currently not recommending until/if things turn around.","April 19","false","65.0"," 283 of 452 people (63%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","63","283","452","10","34"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Argumento/recommended/410380/","Argumento","Argumento","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Argumento/","361 products in account","tl;dr: Whether you're a F2P player or a paying customer, if you like trading card games, Hex is absolutely worth your time.\n\nI've been playing Hex for a bit over two years now. Hex is without a doubt the best digital trading card game, as long as you're willing to invest a bit of your time or money (or better, both).\n\nBusiness Model - Something that can be confusing for new players is the way Hex merges a very fair F2P model for the PVE campaign with a very standard P2P model for PVP. You can play as much of the campaign as you want, completely free of charge, and you will never feel pressured to put money into the game. The campaign throws free cards at you left and right, as well as a currency called Gold. Gold can be used to buy PvP cards from the auction house, but you can also just straight up trade it with other players for Platinum (the paid currency). In this way, it is possible for a completely free player to compete and win huge prizes without ever spending a dime. In fact, the recent winner of the $40,000 top prize at the 2016 Hex Invitational was one such player.\n\nThat said, the amount of grinding required to cobble together a serious constructed PvP deck is staggering, and I wouldn't recommend doing so to most people. If you want to PvP in Hex, expect to spend money (Hex costs about 30-40% as much as Magic).\n\nOn the PvP side, Hex offers TCG staples like Constructed and Draft tournaments, as well as an innovative asynchronous Gauntlet mode that lets you spread out a tournament over as much time as you'd like, playing a match here and there when you have time. PvP tournaments reward valuable prizes for doing well, so if you polish your skills (and are willing to sell cards on the auction house) it's very possible to go infinite and keep playing indefinitely on a small, fixed initial investment.\n\nNow that the ugly money talk is out of the way, let's look at some of the pros and cons:\n\nThe Good:\n- The Hex community is, bar-none, the best community for any online game I've ever played. Everyone is extremely friendly, helpful, and generous. New players frequently find themselves showered with free common and uncommon cards to help jumpstart their collections. In my opinion, the best place to interface with the Hex community is on Twitch[twitch.tv]. There are tons of great streamers, and you usually can't go wrong by just picking whoever has the most viewers at the moment. Watching streams is a great way to learn about the game, and both streamers and other viewers are generally thrilled to answer a new player's questions.\n\n- Hex's gameplay is deep, complex, and rewarding. If you've played Magic: The Gathering, Hex will be instantly familiar, but Hex goes beyond Magic with mechanics that could only be accomplished in a digital game. Cards that create other cards, cards that can be modified by socketing them with gems, permanent modifiers that follow a card even if it goes into your crypt or back into your deck, and effects that happen in secretly without your opponent's knowledge are just the tip of the iceberg. If you're coming from a background with Hearthstone or other simpler CCGs, or if you have no TCG background whatsoever, buckle up, because you're in for a wild ride.\n\n- Hex has the best, most polished interface for any digital TCG, and it's still improving with every patch.\n\n- Card design and balance is fantastic. Even 9 months into a PvP set, the metagame is still vibrant, evolving, and far from solved in either Constructed or Draft.\n\n- The PVE campaign (while currently very short) is a lot of fun, and the merger of RPG and TCG mechanics works very well.\n\n- The Hex development team are fantastic. They're honest, transparent, and generally very responsive about problems that crop up.\n\n- Hex support is prompt and generous to a fault. If you run into a bug (because let's face it, this is a digital game -- bugs happen) in a PvP tournament that even might have cost you the match, you will usually get your tournament entry refunded in full, in addition to whatever prizes you win from the tournament.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Hex currently has a somewhat limited selection of formats (no 2v2 multiplayer, no cube drafting, no house rules etc.), and being a digital game, you can't easily make up your own without the developer's support.\n\n- The pace of development over the last 2 years has been about half as fast as it should have been. This creates long periods of doldrums where a PvP set or campaign chapter has been current too long and players start to get bored of it (example: Armies of Myth, the current PvP set will have been current for 9 months when the next set, Primal Dawn, finally replaces it). The developers claim that new content should be speeding up, and I believe them, but there's the very real possibility that it won't speed up by as much as anyone would like.\n\nThe Ugly:\n- Buying Platinum through Steam gets you 10% less for your money than buying from Hex directly. If you want to buy Platinum, do it through the Gameforge[en.hex.gameforge.com] website instead. After listening to community feedback, they lowered the price of platinum on Steam. I still encourage you to buy through Gameforge, though, as it supports the developers slightly more.\n\n- The game is going through some growth pains after the Steam launch and the servers have gone down a few times. This is not typical -- the servers are rock solid 99% of the time outside of major launches.","April 21","true","153.7"," 40 of 51 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","40","51","0","0"

In my opinion, it's simply the best TCG ever made.  I was excited about HEX from the moment I learned about it, and I played the beta a whole lot before the game launched on Steam.  The game is free to play and it's easy to farm loot to improve your deck for free (using the in-game Auction House).  If you want to invest in your card collection, this game is an affordable addiction to develop--and your cards have real world value too!\n\nI used to play TCGs with friends in person and wanted a good single player TCG experience after I no longer had anyone to play with.  The PVE side of HEX is superb!  You can enjoy the RPG style campaign or test your deck against the Frost Arena for a nice payout.  Before the campaign came, I used to love grinding through the Arena over and over again--I love building and testing out new decks.  I haven't been playing the Arena lately because the campaign is so much fun.\n\nFor the more competitive players, HEX has so much to offer.  You can play a practice match against your friends or someone you meet in chat, or jump into draft or constructed tournament to win some nice prizes.  There are beginner's drafts as well, so you can get in on the fun without knowing everything there is to know about every card available.\n\nThere is no good reason not to try HEX, honestly.  Even if you've never played a TCG before, you should try HEX.","April 19","true","164.1"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","31","36","0","0"

Stole me away from magic, and I have played that for like 20 years. Came to this from playing magic duels which felt like an insanely arduous grindfest trying to build decks. Was stuck for like 2 months opening one pack maybe every two days and using the same starter card decks over and over to grind against cpu with his decks filled with gold cards and planeswalkers.\n\nThis has been a breath of fresh air. Campaign is fun, and you can earn a lot of really good cards in there. Best way to build a deck is to make 4 guys of same race and do the first part til you clear both bridges and get a full playset of their core cards.\n\nYou can then build a good deck to play arena vs AI to get gold and it doesnt feel like a grindfest. I have aquired more cards to build my deck in 3 days on this game than I did in magic duels in 2 months after spending 10$ on both to start with.\n\nAuction house is also a great part of the game that lets you put that gold you got from the arena and campaign to good use. You can buy singles, or equipment which can enhance cards, or sell off some of the stuff you have extras of or doesnt fit your playstyle.\n\nBest card game out there digitally I have played yet, especially if you want to enjoy it for a while before deciding to invest money.

I will make no excuses for the time it has taken to reach this incomplete state or the fact that this is being marketed as a complete product despite lacking many quality of life updates, a more comprehensive tutorial, UI updates, and many of the things promised to backers. I am also not going to pretend that this is the normal kind of 'F2P' game when monetary investments pay off big time, it's more a game you pay for and which you can earn free stuff. I am not here to praise or linger on it's faults - HEX is what it is and what it can be is not what needs to be reviewed and considered here.\n\nIf, and only if, you can tolerate a game with scratches and scuffs and clear signs of needed improvement everywhere you turn your head you will find that the game has a lot to offer you but for an optimal experience you are going to have to go beyond the game itself. You'll need to reach out to the community for help with some free cards to fill your meager starter collection, you'll need to look into how things work beyond the lackluster tutorial, and you'll need to learn to love a lot of the flaws as the game grows and gets bigger and better. This is not a polished perfect product that will give you a handy in the parking lot of Wendys for a smile, you have to earn that handy.\n\nBut it's a pretty good one. HEX offers a solid introductory PvE experience, drafting is fun, the Arena is enjoyable, PvP has it's charm if you're willing to put in the money, and overall the community is pretty kind (although they certainly didn't put their best foot forward downvoting every review into oblivion that wasn't giving the game it's own hand job) and helpful. I honestly think that if you are interested in a TCG experience that is better than everything else on the market today (and believe me, I have been around to every stall and shop in town) and you can tough it out for a bit?

Competitive play will cost money (either buying cards), or paying to enter limited tournaments, but if you're a tcg fan, the experience is everything you'd expect and hope for.\n\nAs a single player game vs AI the game is quite fun as well. There is a campaign mode that tells a story as you progress through, grow a character, and gain new cards for future encounters.\n\nSome general pros and cons that I have are:\n\nPros:\nVery fun mechanics both in the traditional tcg sense, but also the campaign in which you have characters that can level in the realm of a card game.\n\nFree to play system in which you can earn rewards and sell them on the auction house to other players.\n\nContinued development! More tcg sets and more missions in the campagin.\n\nCons:\nThe campaign story telling is a little sad. Characters sometimes respond the same way even with different races, and it doesn't make much sense. In the initial introductory mission, you feel like the races are different, but then when the other missions take place it feels very generic.\n\nThe auction house needs some work. It works for now, but it's pretty clunky.\n\nAs the game is still young and is in active growing development, there are some growing pains.

I was a Kickstarter backer and have been playing since the Alpha.\n\nHex is one of my absolute favorite games. It's one of the best card games I've ever played, and blows away every other digital TCG.\n\nA couple points:\n1) Is it free to play?\nYou CAN play 100% free. The entire PvE experience is completely free. You can play the full campaign. You can earn the PvE cards and equipment as loot from playing. None of that requires spending a dime.\n\nThe PvP has a cost associated with it, BUT that cost doesn't have to be money. PvP booster packs are purchased with platinum (the real money currency). However, you can sell/trade your PvE loot for platinum or PvP cards/packs. So, you can play 100% free as long as you are willing to invest some time into the PvE to earn platinum.\n\n2) Is it pay to win?\nNo. It's a TCG, and the PvP does follow the traditional TCG model of buying booster packs. However, as mentioned above, you can earn those packs/cards via just playing the game and trading. You CAN pay for more packs/cards which will give you more options, but they don't make you stronger or better than someone else. A skilled player is much more dangerous than a good deck.\n\n3) How does this compare to Hearthstone?\nThis game is a little bit slower, but is a lot more strategic. The main advantage that Hex has is being able to play cards on your opponent's turn. This makes a HUGE difference in strategy. It gives the player a lot more control and a lot more options. The other difference is that the defender declares blockers. It allows you to make a lot more strategic defensive decisions. And to go along with that... damage to troops is not permanent. This changes the gameplay from fast paced cycling of creatures to something with a lot more interesting decisions. Overall, Hex is just a deeper, more strategic game.\n\nAlso, the PvE in Hex blows away Hearthstones by a mile. It's much more in depth with character customization, quests, story nodes, full dungeons, varied paths to take, etc.\n\n4) How does this compare to Magic: The Gathering?\nIt is very similar. Hex obviously took a lot of inspiration from MTG, but Hex does plenty to differentiate itself. The resource system is similar at first glance, but there are a lot of nuanced differences. The decoupling of threshold from costs has a lot of interesting things that go along with it (being able to play multiple cards of a color with a single threshold, or having cards with a threshold cost higher than their actual resource cost, for example).\n\nPermanent effects! That's right, effects are permanent and persist through various changes. A buffed creature that is returned to your hand or placed into your deck retains these buffs even after being re-drawn and/or played. This leads to a lot of interesting options.\n\nDigital only mechanics. There are a lot of mechanics in Hex that just wouldn't work (or would be very tedious to attempt) in a physical card game. For example, the prophecy mechanic affects the next card of a certain type in your deck when the card with prophecy is played. The permanent/persistent effects wouldn't really work in a physical card game. Tons of these types of things exist throughout Hex which make for a very interesting experience.\n\nChampions/Charge powers. You have a champion with a specific power. When a resource is played you get a charge (there are other ways to get charges as well, but this is the basic method). The charge power has a specific cost to activate. These powers vary from simple things such as just drawing a card to buffing all troops that share a type. These are not only interesting additions from a strategic point of view, but also help combat resource flood as you'll be able to activate the charge power with those resources.\n\nThen there's the PvE... which there is no equivalent to. If you like MTG there is a good chance you'll enjoy Hex as well.\n\n5) Can you really make money from this game?\nYes! Not only was there recently a $100,000 tournament, but you can sell your in-game items (cards, packs, etc) for real money via third party trading. These cards DO have a value! There are plenty of third party sites set up in which you can either sell/buy directly with a store or with other players.\n\nSummary\nIf you like deep strategic card games, then you owe it to yourself to check this game out. If you like single player card games, you'll love the PvE. If you like competitive card games, there's plenty of that in various forms (Constructed, Sealed, and Draft with both synchronous and asynchronous modes). This is one of the best card games out there!","April 19","true","57.1"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","24","28","0","1"

In fact, Hex is a vastly superior game to them horrible MtG games on steam because even though I am very early into the campaign, the graphics are nice with gorgeous paintings for backgrounds, the character you play as can develop with skills and experience points and it looks like I have a rich story ahead of me.\n\nAnother thing about it is that it doesn't seem to be a pay to win game as you can obtain all the cards you want using an in game currency that you get rewarded for winning games, but theres also a premium currency if you dont have the patience to grind.

I had never kickstarted a game before, never played a beta let alone an alpha, so this was quite an interesting experience for me. I came to this game because I love TCGs, and I needed convenience to play one. I had played Magic when it first came out, but as a kid, I never understood how big it would get. Later in life I would try to play the WoW tcg, but quickly found that being a physical game had restrictions when you had adult responsibilities to adhere too. Hex allows me to have all that I love in TCG, and play in big tournaments from home.\n\nBut the game has become so much more then that. The community of the game is some of the best I have ever had the pleasure of being apart of. I really like a lot of the streamers, and people that I interact with on a weekly basis. The game does innovative things, because it exists solely in a digital environment without physical restrictions. The game has a passionate team that communicate with us, and drive the game through amazing leaps and bounds, always getting better then it was before. Hex provides a free to play Player verse Environment area where people can win cards, equipment, and gold to continually improve their decks, and collections. Staunch grinders can reputedly make enough gold, to actually draft now and then furthering their collection. Talented draft players and auction has savvy individuals have been able to go infinite, and amass a collection without having to drop money into the game all the time. Streamers and community members do giveaways, and help new people out, as they enter into the game and start learning what the game has to offer.\n\nThe game offers up options for several kinds of players. Collectors, competitive players, free to play players, and you can just play the campaign for fun.\n\nThis isn't to say that the game doesn't have flaws.\n\nHex is a small company, with a limited staff, trying to do huge amazing things, in a variety of areas. This is a huge under taking. Because of this production time can be slow at times, communication can sometimes become strained, and vague. Sometimes they will make choices that people don't agree with. The tutorial and introduction to hex has grown by leaps and bounds but still sometimes confuses people. Lastly, many of the promises from the kickstarter have yet to be delivered, and that scares new people, and infuriates some older people. The initial campaign is a little short, and the replay-ability is not as good as it could be.\n\nDespite these flaws the game is well worth while. The company continues to add staff, and create a foundation, that makes the next step easier, smoother and more efficient. Production time, and deadlines are getting faster, and I have faith will eventually work like a well oiled machine, producing PVP, PVE and events in a fashion that at the very least every couple of months something new is happening. As new people come in, and talk to veterans, staff members, the helpful Nobles, and talk on our forums, the game will improve. Kickstarter rewards are slowly being checked off, and the majority of the Kickstarters have accepted the delay with grace and poise, while still letting them know they don't want to be forgotten, and Hex continues to prove that we won't be. When they make a mistake and the people talk to them in reasonable ways, letting them know how they feel, they consider our words very carefully. If it was indeed a mistake, then they are quick to find a solution, always putting us first. Sometimes they make a choice that we don't agree with, and after careful consideration they stand firm. I personally have experienced this, and feel that in those edge cases, they are doing what they think is right, and I believe that they can see the bigger picture then I can, so I put my faith in them. The adventure zones will continues to come, enhancing and expanding the game, the focus will broaden, and the secrets that are hidden in the lore, will slowly come to the surface. Choices will go from making small effects in small places, to large effects that ripple through the story.\n\nLastly I want to stress something that I think is often missed in a game like this. If you find the campaign short, if you love playing draft casually but maybe don't like the meta. Walk away, and take a break. I have through these two years, had to for one reason or another slow down, or take a break from the game. When something new draws me back, I am always excited to jump into the new tasty treats with gusto. Sometimes though, you just got to take a break. That doesn't mean you have to leave forever. Come back when your not burned out, when something new excites you, or whatever.\n\nRemember the game is free to download, free to try, free to talk to others who are playing. Taste it, and see if Hex is right for you.","April 25","true","91.2"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

I was initially impressed with the digital only game mechanics, the small but friendly community, and the visually appealling and functional interface.\n\nI don't have a large disposable income to spend on games, and luckily I had over a year of free drafts and an inital pool of boosters to begin with due to the KS tier. After these ran out, I have been esentially a free to play player.\n\nI see a fair share of unwarrented criticism of "pay to win" and barriers to entry for the "free to play" crowd amongst these reviews, and can say that this is untrue. The economy is completely player driven, due to an ingame Auction House.\nOne can  earn gold via the PVE Frost Ring Arena or Campaign mode, and then buy packs on the Auction House to enter drafts with, and value draft (aka rare draft) in order to both increase ones card collection and gain valuable cards to resell in order to finance future drafts.\n\nAs an alternative to grinding for gold, a market savvy player could follow a traditional "buy low, sell high" speculation strategy (there are external resources such as hexprice that track market pricing trends).\n\nThis game has great potential once all of the features are fully fleshed out, with upcoming cooperative PVE raids, more character classes, increased level cap and larger talent trees. My main complaint would be the slow release schedule of new content, but new sets are fairly large and there are many deck archetypes from earlier sets that I still haven't had time to experiment with, so there are plenty of things to do to keep the content from getting too stale while awaiting new releases.\n\nI would highly recommend this game to others who enjoy collectible card games. There may have been some server hiccups with the Steam release, but if you can look past those and give this game a chance, then I think it is definitely worth it.\n","April 22","true","491.6"," 32 of 43 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","32","43","2","0"

Simply, this game is EVERYTHING I have wanted in a TCG.\n\n- The community is amazing.  It is by far the most helpful and friendly of any game I've played.  Clearly things may change with the massive influx this new platform will bring, but the core playerbase (supported by the devs) has cultivated something truely special.\n- Similarly, the developers have done right by the community the vast majority of the time.  It's clear and apparent they care deeply about building a strong ethical reputation with their playerbase.\n- It plays similar to MTG, but the digital only realm vastly expands available mechanics, interactions, and future potential.\n- Free to play PVE currency (gold) actually has a valuable transaction rate to premium currency (platnum). With some patience and understanding of the economy you can easily transition into buying packs, tournament entires etc.  In game assets can be purchased with EITHER currency as reasonable prices through the in-game auction house.\n- The art and audio are fantastic, the atmosphere is stellar.\n\n- This game has unfortunately suffered from multiple delays development wise.  While this is certainly a negative, I feel that the attention, and try and do right by the players attitude mitigates my frustrations with the slow development place.  I anticipate future PVE and PVP releases to be at a much more acceptable cadence.\n- Some of the lore is...discordant.  I enjoy the vast majority of it, however there are certain aspects that seem out of place or that I don't personally care for.  This is clearly in the eye of the beholder but some players may be slightly turned off by it.  I do not recommend the Hex novel.\n- As of yet unimplemented features.  The potential is there and the rest of the game is SO good, that it makes waiting for promised but un-implemented features all the more painful.  Per above, I"m hopeful development and release speed should improve dramatically.\n\nAll said and done, I would (and have) recommended this game to a wide and diverse set of people.  It's worth spending at least a few hours ingame before forming your opinion as much of the game really starts to shine once you have an appreciation for how all the systems interact.\n\nDEFINATELY TRY THIS GAME.","April 24","true","122.8"," 32 of 43 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","32","43","0","0"

I've had a lot of fun with it and I'd say it is definitely worth it to download and try it if you like collectible card games.\n\nHex has a business model similar to Magic where cards are fully tradable and have "value" in that the rare cards are worth real money - but the downside to this is that the game can't really give them out to you for free like other F2P card games and the majority of cards are gained from paid booster packs.  Basically, to win in constructed tournaments you will probably need to pay money to buy the rarest cards from other players (like in Magic).  I think that the HEX in-game auction house works really well to do this.\n\nHowever, it is definitely possible to go infinite in limited (draft and sealed) if you are good enough, and the rate of grinding real money currency from the PVE content if you are efficient is far superior to that of any other game I've seen.  I am impressed that the free currency, gold, has maintained so much real value over the years.  The economy is entirely player-driven.\n\nThe available PVE content is fun and can be completed without spending anything.  I have tested this content without any previous cards or interaction with the auction house and it is definitely beatable.  Depending on what race you choose though, you may have to create several characters and use the free cards collected over all those characters to beat the campaign.  I find the campaign a lot of fun, but it is pretty light on content right now (only chapter 1 is out).  Hopefully more content will be released soon and at a faster rate.\n\nTo maintain the value of cards but still be able to give out cards for free, the campaign gives out the common cards as rewards as well as special PVE-only cards.  So for "free" you can pick up the commons that you'd get from booster packs, but to get the uncommons, rares, and legendaries for free you would have to buy them with gold from the auction house or trade your gold for the real-money currency platinum.\n\nI find this game to be more complex (in a good way) in its mechanics than the other F2P card games I have played and though it is very mechanically similar to Magic I think it has some cool digital innovations that Magic doesn't have.  Though it doesn't promise to let you get a full collection for free like other CCG games such as Hearthstone, the fact that you can trade your cards freely and use the auction house actually makes it easier to build the deck you want (rather than relying purely on pack randomness and a grindy crafting system).\n\nIn short, I would recommend this game both as a completely free experience with the PVE campaign as well as a paid trading card game that is similar to what you get with Magic but cheaper, more accessible, and more fun.","April 19","true","79.8"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

(Shame on the multiple groups responsible for massive failure with MtG, especially for going backwards ever since the Green Lizard version...)\n\nThere is some twist in resource usage that makes it even more interesting.

With that frame of reference, I find Hex better in most ways to what MTGO brings to the table and wholeheartedly recommend the game. The great thing is, if you have even a passing interest, the PVE Campaign in Hex is completely free to play, so you can try it out with no investment. Technically you can grind enough to play the PVP side of the game without buying in as well, but it's a very long grind.\n\nThere are things MTGO does better:\nVariety of formats - Hex is still limited to about four tournament formats that are supported in client and fire with any regularity. MTGO has more formats than I care to count and the player base to support them.\nDepth of PVP play - Hex is about to release set 4, so currently has fewer than 1000 cards available for PVP, whereas MTGO draws from the entire history of Magic\nDraft Interface - I love the draft interface in the new MTGO client, and the Hex draft interface, while serviceable, pales in comparison.\n\nEverything else I feel is in Hex's favor, and much of these factors are so much better than MTGO that the comparison is laughable:\n- Graphics and presentation of gameplay is much more engaging, the music is beautiful and lends itself well to the setting\n- The overall UI is much easier to use (the one exception being the "chat" function, which is meh)\n- There is meaningful PVE play that awards cards and gold which can be used to buy more cards in the Auction House\n- There's an Auction House to easily buy and sell cards and other items\n- The game makes fantastic use of the digital space with innovative gameplay that MTGO can never replicate while it is tied to the tabletop game\n- The price is roughly half of what MTGO costs for similar events/tournaments/etc.\n\nNote about price: yes, you are most likely going to need to invest to play PVP. This is the same with the direct competition which is MTGO, but the price to buy-in to Hex is roughly half what you pay in MTGO for similar experiences, and you are more likely to get a return on your investment that helps fund further activities. Just don't go in thinking "free to play" means you can easily grind the whole game; it applies mostly to the PVE play.","April 19","true","310.6"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","0"

Single player RPG like campaign, various tournaments and play modes, card trading auction house, CHAT on a very robust game client that's a joy to be on.\n\nPVE and versus matches use separate decks and progression.  Compared to some other F2P card games out there, HEX is quite a bit heavier on the monotonous gold grinding for purchasing cards/packs, especially before you collect enough cards to make a cheap competitive deck.\n\nTake notes, Wizards of the Coast.  THIS is how it's done.\n\nIf you have even a passing interest in CCG/TCG's, and haven't tried HEX, DO SO NOW.\n\nAs always, I can't expect everyone to agree with a subjective review, but if you decide to thumb it down I would appreciate hearing what should be improved!","April 20","true","9.5"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","0"

Similar to MtG, but with enough unique features to gameplay (like being able to track changes to cards, having full cards generated instead of just token, the champion/avatar system) that make HEX games just fun to play.\n•  HEX has AMAZING art.  Each card has exceptional art.  I was around in MtG's early days and HEX is nothing like that.  In fact, HEX art now in many cases is a step above what MtG currently has.\n• A pretty welcoming community.  Being a game that was Kickstarted means that there are already some veterans in the game since the beta that are always looking out to help their fellow players.\n\nCONS:\n• The biggest complaint I can leverage is that development seems to be a little slow.  The game shows great promise (and as mentioned, beautiful), but new features seem to come along a bit slow considering the genre.\n• While marketed as F2P, it really isn't.  It is very cheap for a trading card game, but a significant investment of time would be required for a person to play the PvP sections without ever spending a dime.

I think you should definately give it a try and decide if it is for you.\n\nPros:\n- Active and helpful community that will help you with any problems related to the game or not.\n- Large sets of cards with many unique and fun effects\n-  Rich tabletop RPG-like single player with over 10 hours of things to do. Very unique encounters can be seen with a lot of fun mechanics. And more hours of content coming in a future update. No paying required at all.\n-Trading with players via mail or the auction house lets you deal with cards you don't want. Your cards have real value with the auction house.\n- Tons of new content still on the way. Game is never "finished". New card set coming out in 1 week which will even up the draft playing field.\nPvP tournament\nLarge community tournaments run 2x every weekend. Entirely free to enter and you can earn a lot of packs and platinum (even from just door prizes)\n\n\nCons:\n- The use of Gold isn't very obvious unless you specifically look for it in the Auction House.\n- Release schedule for new content can be a bit slow. However this is looking to pick up very soon. New set in 1 week hype!\n- No ranked ladder. You can play for free against random opponents but there is no incentive other than testing decks. The things that matter cost 100-500 platinum to enter (which is possible to earn in game) where by winning you can earn free packs to open or sell.\n- If you lose all your platinum from failing tournaments, you have to grind PvE arena for gold in order to enter another tournament (takes a few hours, but you keep all the packs you open from the tournaments so it can be worth it anyways).","April 19","true","135.1"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

Whether you're a TCG veteran or a newbie, competetive or not, you'll find something to love in this game.\n\nThe PVE campaign combines the depth of a trading card game with traditional RPG elements (classes, levelling, skill trees) to make for a great experience.  The campaign is completely free-to-play, you'll earn cards and gold you can use to improve your deck, as well as any cards you get from playing the PVP side of the game.  There's several hours of content here with much more in the works.\n\nFor the competetive types, PVP definitely can stand on its own.  Unlike the campaign, PVP is generally pay-to-play outside of friendly constructed games or player-driven leagues.  Tournaments consist of limited formats such as draft and sealed and competetive constructed where you bring your own deck.

Play and sacrifice your sleep :)\n\nHEX is maybe best compared to Magic Online. You collect virtual Cards that have real trade Value (in contrast to e.g. Heartstone, were you can't trade your Cards), hence the namen Trading Card Game. If you never played a TCG and want to find out if it is a Genre you like, stop reading this review and start playing, it's free! After that come back and read the rest of the review ;)\n\nFor those of you who already are familiar with TCGs, here are the things that make HEX different from other (online) TCGs:\n\n- It has a fair F2P model (more info later)\n- It is purely digital, which means it can use mechanics that are only possible in a digital TCG!\n- It has PvE Content!\n\nThe F2P Model:\n\nSince this is a "real" TCG you can buy digital boosterpacks to get new cards. One Boosterpack has 15 Cards and costs 2$ (200 Platinum). Compared to real boosterpacks this is a good deal! How can one now earn Boosterpacks for free to play? Playing PvE! When you are playing one of the 2 PvE Modes (Campaign or Arena) you will earn Gold, the F2P Currency.\n\nBut how do you get from Gold to Platinum to Boosterpacks? There are huge goldsinks in this game that earn vanity Items like cardsleeves or alternate art cards. So players want to buy your gold to throw it into the sink (literally, the goldsink is a sink :P). The exchange rate at this point is about 120 Gold : 1 Platin. When you are new you can earn about 6500 gold per hour.\n\n---> 55 platin/hour and to reach the magical 700 platin you will need about 13 hours. That is about the time that the PvE content alone would satisfy you, maybe you will spend even more time in PvE alone, when creating different campaign characters (The HEX community is awesome and might give you a little kickstart btw :D).\n\nWhy is 700 platin such a magical number? That is the amount you need to play draft! (3 booster packs + 100p)\nTo explain draft would go into to much detail here, if you are curious, read a guide about drafting. The important point is, from this moment on, you can earn Platinum (if you are good enough). Everyone is keeping the Cards they drafted. 3rd and 4th place earn 2 boosterpacks, 2nd place 3 and 1st place will earn 5 boosterpacks!\n\nEven if you loose your draft, since you hopefully drafted cards that are worth something, you can sell them and only have to earn about 200-300 new platin playing PvE.\n\nSummary: Always play Draft instead of opening packs!!!\n\nNow to some Pro & Cons about Hex:\n\nCons:\n-Kind of slow devolpment of new content (To be fair, they had to finetune the whole game engine ect. first, so there is hope that it will speed up now)\n-Some UI Elements feel a bit clunky (chat, auction house, card collection)\n\nPros:\n- Awesome Community!!!\n- Super F2P model for a TCG\n- PvE content\n- Nice carddesigns and fun mechanics!\n\nTo sum it up: Give it a try! :D","April 19","true","74.3"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

That's right, that's a "T", not a "C". This is not like Hearthstone, Duelyst or Magic: Duels. Every card you collect has value as it can be traded with other players or sold on the auction house. This gives an immense sense of satisfaction as your collection grows in both size and value and you can spend as much time battling other players as you can "playing" the auction house market.\nBoth deckbuilding and actual card battling contain endless depth and strategy. Do not be put off if things seem daunting at first.\n(If you're put off by the essential Pass Priority system, make sure you check out the control settings so that a single button press can skip phases for you if you want to.)\n\nMore in-depth description below, and some cons at the end.\n\nHEX has two main components, PvP play and PvE play.\n\nIn PvP you can battle against other players (durr) in casual games or in a variety of tournament formats. The latter can be constructed (bring your own pre-made deck, complete with reserves to switch in/out in-between best-of rounds) or limited (draft play, where a group of players open packs together in a virtual circle and take turns selecting cards as the packs get passed around, then you build your deck from your picks; or sealed, where you open a bunch of packs at once and then build your deck from a large pool of cards).\nThere are a few different versions of the above, most notable Constructed/Sealed Gauntlet, which is an asynchronous play mode for those short on time (highly recommend Sealed Gauntlet -- open your pool, seek some advice from players either in-game or outside on the forums, and take as much time building your deck, and tweaking inbetween matches, as you like).\nGranted, PvP can be considered to have a buy-in (i.e. you need to bring the packs and an entry fee yourself), but this is no different to real-world TCGs, but remember that once you start getting good at draft/sealed your winnings mean more packs as prizes and thus you can begin to go endless when combined with selling for profit on the auction house.\n\nIn PvE, there's currently the first part of the main Campaign. This will be split into many Adventure Zones (AZ), but at the moment there's on AZ1 (still a solid chunk offering many hours of FREE gameplay). PvE is COMPLETELY FREE. There are no exhaustion timers or other F2P crap like that, you can play as much as you like and as you do you'll pick up countless rewards in terms of PvE-specific cards, experience for your RPG-like character (levels up unlocking new abilities etc) and Gold. The latter can be used on the auction house to quickly fill out your collection (players sell common/uncommon cards for such little gold that you'll spend no time amassing a decent basic collection), or traded with other players (many many PvP need gold, myself included, so there's always high demand for it creating a beautiful connection between PvP and PvE-only players).\nOther on the PvE side is the Frost Ring Arena, a dungeon of 4 tiers of increasing difficulty that grant you increasing rewards as you progress. A typical "full" arena run nets you about 6000-7000 gold, cards and equipment.\n\nWhat's equipment, you say? Equipment is another PvE facet that lets you further customise your deck to the nth degree. Your character can wield up to 6 different types of equip (of thousands in the game to find and loot, of varying rarities of course) and each piece can alter cards in unique ways, from basic things like modifying the attack/defense of a card to completely changing the way cards work and almost making them "OP broken" (<<< somewhat of a joke, but there are some insanely powerful pieces of equipment to hunt for).\n\nA few other bits: when you open a booster pack (which of course can be traded just like anything else), you not only get your cards, but it'll also spawn a chest. Chests come in different rarities with different loot tables, but typically contain a piece of equipment or a special alternate art version of cards. At the highest rarities you can find special card sleeves (something you can't trade, so sleeve your cards with pride).\nChests can also be spun (for gold -- that's why PvPers often want gold) on a slot-machine like altar for a chance at unique rewards too.\nWhen you purchase a pack through the in-game store, there's a small chance at proc'ing a Primal Pack -- these contain ONLY rares and legendaries and are highly sought after. Either open them to vastly boost your collection, or sell them for ludicrous profit on the auction house.\n\nAnd finally, a few cons to round this off:\n\n1) Development of HEX has been much slower than anticipated. We're about to hit the 4th set (a perfect ime to start playing), but this has really taken longer than it should have done. Granted, a lot of systems are now in place that weren't before, so let's hope things speed up from her on out as new content on a timely schedule is critical to a TCG's success.\n\n2) The client still needs some optimisation/settings to run well on lower machines. Expect some FPS drops in the PvE campaign if your system isn't up to spec. Hopefully this will get sorted in the future.\n\n3) Perceived barrier to entry. I would like to see more done to welcome new payers, especially those wanting to only be F2P. The community (at least pre-Steam) is one of the best on the internet, so people are always there to help out, but the new player experience may miss off some key points to help people get into things quickly and easily and understand that this is NOT a pay-to-win game. The PvP aspects are pay-to-play (to a degree) like all the good physical TCGs.","April 19","true","130.8"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

As a long-time MTG player (started around 1st Mirrodin block) I was able to pick up the basics of the game fairly quickly. But even now I'm still discovering new card interactions and ways to play. Don't get me wrong, I adore Magic, but I've drifted away from the card shop scene, and Magic's digital offerings are completely garbage. Hex, while fairly similar to Magic in many ways (part of the appeal to me imho), has enough uniqueness to both set it apart from Magic and elevate it in many ways.\nHex fully embraces the possibilities of a digital-only card game, and I can't wait to see what Primal Dawn (set 4) will bring to the table.\n\n---\n\nPros:\n-Digital nature allows for some truly bonkers card design. Super fun!\n-Collection has real value\n-PvP is competitive and fun, even though I still suck at limited :P. Will be even better once ladders are implemented.\n-PvE was a blast my first time through, and I still keep coming back with new characters and decks. Lots of potential. Wish there were more character slots though.\n-Legitimately one of the best communities in gaming. You run into the occasional salt factory in pvp every so often, but most people are super friendly and willing to help out newbies. When I first started people were giving me tons of tips that really helped me learn the game. A few players even sent me cards to fill out my collection some more! Now that I'm a more established player I've been doing that myself.\n-Dev team listens to players and are very passionate about their game.\n\n---\n\nCons\n-A little bit more RNG than I'd like in some of the card designs.\n-Devs can be slow to release content and are a bit afraid to post release dates for content, which is a source of frustration among the community. I'm sympathetic, and the devs are definitely making an effort to improve this, but this could turn off some people.\n\n---\n\nA note for new players: Presumably due to the cut that steam takes out of sales, you get about 10% less plat when purchasing through the steam game client than you would in the standalone client or on the website. I would recommend players to go to us.hex.gameforge.com, visit the "my account" page, and click 'top up on plat' for any plat purchasing. More money for Hex Ent, more plat for you, everyone wins! (cept steam)\n\n---\n\nSome new player resources:\n\nfiveshards.com - Articles and podcasts almost daily from some of Hex's best players. They also host free constructed weekly tourneys, which are great fun.\n\nhexmeta.com - Up-to-date decklists and other info on the hex constructed scene. A great resource for keeping track of the constructed meta.\n\nhexprice.com - Price tracking and history for just about any tradeable item in Hex. Great for those looking to get good deals on the AH.\n\nhex.tcgbrowser.com - Probably the site I use the most. You can set up an api to import your card collection and automatically maintain a wishlist/tradelist that syncs as your collection grows. I make tons of trades using this feature alone. On top of that you can look up any card in the game, brew decks and analyse them, and view tons of player decks for both PVE and PVP.\n\nhexprimal.com - You can buy or sell cards/equipment here, and they periodically post articles about the hex economy and guides for PvP and PvE decks. Highly recommend their pve campaign series for new players.\n\nhextcg.com - The official website, with regular contributions from the community and updates from the dev team. I check it daily!\n\nboard.hex.gameforge.com - The official forums, very active! You can find just about anything you could want here.\n\ntwitch.tv/hextcg - Hex has a great community of streamers!

It's even compelling. But it's unfinished.\n\nThe Kickstarter promised dungeons galore, PvE adventures, guilds, set bonuses, raids, double backs, and more. All of that is missing, despite it's now "launched" status.

The drafting is a blast, the tournament scene is killer.\n\nIf HEX Entertainment could hit deadlines, I'd be much more apt to reccomend HEX. But the truth of the matter is, HEX is a waiting game.

Some commenters already pointed them already but here are the main issues from my point of view:\n\n- The "free to play" label is misleading because after just the first day you realise you need to invest real cash and/or lot of grind time to actually make any progression (expanding your card collection). A new player has no chance to finish the first PVE chapter without buying some extra cards or having an insane luck (read "tons of frustration" until it happens).\n\n- The development of the game started years ago and even the crowdfunding was very successful (based on their MMOTCG vision) they delivered just a really short chapter with almost no interactions with other players (at this point you can only chat and buy/sell cards via AH). Other than that it is a single player experience.\n\n- In order to participate to PVP events you need to buy tickets (with platinum). You can buy platinum directly from the cash shop or grind gold (invest in a good deck) and convert it to items (cards, boosters or equipment) and sell those via AH for platinum.\n\n-The strategy of Cryptozoic is focused on luring new people into playing and don't care too much about retaining them. This was visible from the starting campaign when they offered ridiculous overpowered rewards for backers. Too bad for the others. Later when community was screaming for PVE content they preferred on heavily investing and promoting their PVP tournament. Some bugs are present unfixed since alpha (eg Forge of Cadoc) and in addition things that were fine are broken after updates (eg. Arena challenges rewards). My general impression is they bite more than they can chew.\n\nTo be fair I would like to add also some positive comments:\n\n- Even if their roots are visible connected with the MtG on the launching set, they put serious efforts to differentiate from those by creating new mechanics and exploiting the digital aspect of the cards.\n\n- The game looks polish and in general the quality of artworks is quite high (except the character portraits who look a bit rushed).\n\n- It is a great idea with huge potential, I still hope they will take this more seriously and eventually (IN A REASONABLE TIMEFRAME) achieve what they promised in the beginning.\n\nI could have made this as a "positive" review but I just want them to keep the developers with the feets on the ground and point (once again) that this is NOT a finished product.","May 5","false","74.1"," 96 of 159 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","96","159","3","13"

If you like it but mostly for the PvE content, then you can keep tabs on the updates and jump back in when AZ2 is released, which is supposed to be 'soon (TM)'.","May 21","true","65.0"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

Hex is all the pros of an intricate and interactive TCG like Magic with the benefits of a sleek online interface like Hearthstone. Having been on the market for several years already, Hex provides a massive amount of content for new and veteran TCG players alike. The single-player campaign is a singularly unique experience as it seeks to emulate MMO's in storytelling, questing, loot, and more while retaining all the deckbuilding and gameplay challenges you'd expect from a TCG. The PVP content sports a myriad of traditional archetypes with unique twists and sports a low entry cost for the genre. Hex offers numerous formats in which to battle fellow players, whether it's in the Constructed Gauntlet, a traditional Draft, or a competitive tournament. Hex delivers a fresh look at an old genre while retaining everything you've come to love from a TCG.\n\nQuick note for new players: There are usually packs for sale for Gold in the Auction House. You can also go to the trade chat to trade your Gold for Platinum to buy packs or singles.","April 20","true","369.1"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

Probably the best 'free-to-play' game I've ever come across. The variety of effects, abilities and possibilities is awesome. The presentation is at least on par with one of the year MTG card games as well. The solo adventure mode is a lot of fun, reminds me of the old planeswalker games. Then there's the added benefit of trading and auctions and you have a full blown digital ecosystem that makes sense.

Raptr says I have logged 707 hours in the game prior to Steam Launch. I know not all of my time got properly tracked.\n\nHEX IS AMAZING. I've logged more hours in Hex than any other game.\n\nThis is not just a game. It is a hobby. It will own your heart for years. There alre lots of other positive reviews. So, I'll keep mine to a few few things I think you need to understand going into it.\n\n1 - THERE'S A LOT OF DEPTH - We already have hundreds of cards in 3 sets, and the 4th major set comes out next week. Accept that it will take time to understand everything. The community is very good about helping new players out. You're not going to be elite an hour after you finish the tutorial.\n\n2 - UNDERSTAND THE ECONOMY - This is not F2P where everything is handed to you on a silver platter. The PVE campaign and Frost Ring Arena are free to play. These are good places to learn how the game works, and earn some gold to buy more cards from the Auction House (Or sell your cards for the premium currency, Platinum). Hex makes its money selling booster packs and entrance fees to tournaments, like traditional TCGs. These items can be purchased from gold with time, but it isn't quick.\n\n3 - PAY TO COMPETE (Not Pay to Win!!!!!) - It absolutely is possible to trade gold for packs and plat, and turn that around to going infinite with skilled play. That's not realistic for most of us. If you want to play in draft or sealed tournaments regularly, get comfortable with supporting the developers with the purchase of plat. This is a very traditional TCG business model.\n\nCosts are EXTREMELY REASONABLE\nFor a booster draft (assuming 100 plat = $1):\n$2 per booster x 3 packs = $6\n+100 plat ($1) entry fee = $7.\nIf you play Swiss draft, you'll play 3 rounds. That's 3 hours of entertainment for $7, which is a better value than going to a movie - and you can sell some of those cards to finance more drafts. You get a booster for each win, so even at 1-2, you're getting more than the entry cost.\n\nCompare the costs of Hex to Magic: The Gathering, or any other TCG, and I think the value speaks for itself.\n\nThe game is not "Pay to Win," because there is a lot of skill involved in Hex. You can have decks full of legendary cards and still get wrecked by smarter players. I know this cause I'm the one with the legendaries who loses in big tournaments =) But I keep coming back for more.\n\nDownload the game. Watch Cory's release video. Get ready to enjoy Hex for years to come. Welcome to the party!","April 19","true","136.7"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","23","30","0","0"

There is a competitive PVP scene ranging from free ingame community tournaments to a recent Invitational which awarded $100,000 in cash prizes.  It's a true TCG with the emphasis on Trading.  Unlike CCG's like Hearthstone, players can trade or sell their cards which means their collection will always have value.\n\nThe PVE content is small for now but more is promised on the way.  You can fight against the AI in a campaign to level a character or in the arena to grind for gold, the ingame currency which has real value.  Gold can be used to buy cards or equipment on the ingame Auction House.  You can even trade gold for plat (the currency you buy with cash) to other players by using the ingame mail COD system.\n\nThe game is free to try and you get 200 cards to start your collection off.

Add to this the new PVE content which fits my solo play style, and I've found my heaven.\n\nWhile technically this is a free to play game (and infact you are given a good number of cards by completing tutorials and playing the PVE campaign), if your goal is to complete in constructed PvP, you will likely end up spending money or time.  However, there are also limited PvP competition options, like drafting (where everyone is on the same foot, only relying on knowledge of cards, deck buidling, and lady luck in what is passed/opened), or swiss style where you open packs and create your deck from that pool.\n\nOver all, while I still play other games, this is my go-to when it comes to TCG's.  I highly recommend giving it a try, since you can try for free.  Play through the tutorials and some of the PvE campaign to get a feel and aquire some free cards and in-game currency (gold).  Before jumping into PvP, watch some of the many Twitch streamers for draft pointers and to get a feel for the game mechanics.  And if you have questions, ask in chat.

Random PVP, Tournaments, and good hearted challenges to your friends are in abundance, as well are the bragging rights.  If you get sick of doing that, come check out the RPG PvE environment with the campaign, and when you think you're good enough, try your deck against the arena.  Just not getting the cards you need in the game?  Buy packs with the in game premium currency platinum to improve your card roster.  Exchange your hard fought gold for platinum if you don't want to spend your hard earned real money.  The game is entirely free to play with the gold to platinum exchange run by players for players.  If that isn't enough, why not check out the Auction house to buy and sell those cards you really want, or don't care for.  All In all, If you've played MAGIC, you'll pick this up easily.  If you played Hearthstone, your learning curve is a bit more but you have a bit of info over someone who walks in with no card experience at all.

Every part of the promise in the Kickstarter excited me - a Magic the Gathering like game I could play on my computer, designed for online play from the ground up, with robust PvP, drafts, sealed tournaments, constructed - all for a fraction of the price of Magic. Great, sign me up! But wait, there's more! A fully fledged RPG, exploring an open world, levelling up your character, unlocking new traits, working together with friends to take down raid bosses, a full guild system, and tons of cards and equipment to collect. Okay, that sounds amazing. And I won't lie - a big part of what excited me was being a part of such a great game right from the start. I'm sure many people have wished they could have played Magic from the days of Alpha and just had boxes of Moxes and Lotuses. And here was my chance with Hex!\n\nSo, has Hex delivered on those promises? Well, partially. The game itself is awesome, and every bit as fun as they made it out to be (I wouldn't have played at least a full draft tournament every week since they were launched back in 2014 if it wasn't!). PvP is great - it's a really fun draft, sealed and costructed format, and everyone is looking forwards to the release of the new set, Primal Dawn, next week.\n\nNow, the PvE side of things has been lagging behind. But this year we're finally starting to be rewarded for our patience, as they added the first major update to campaign. Granted, this is far behind the original release schedule (the very first release date speculation of "hopefully full release by end of the year" given during the 2013 Kickstarter now seems laughable in hindsight). But the promises are now starting to be made good on, and campaign is everything we hoped for - a great single player experience, with fun levelling, dungeons, character creation, equipment and more. THis is a great time to pick Hex up, as it finally starts to become the game it was meant to be - both TCG and RPG.\n\nThere is still a lot more to come. The promised multiplayer raids are yet to materialise, in game guild support is still missing, and currently only three of the six final classes have been added, with one more promised with the launch of Adventure Zone 2. Hex isn't yet in its completed state, but what we do have certainly won't disappoint. Campaign is a lot of fun, the Frost Ring Arena is a nice challenge, and, of course there's the PvP side of things, which is basically feature complete. Now is a great time to jump into Hex - you get all the benefits of an amazingly fun TCG on the PvP side, and get to be in at the start of Hex's journey to also being an amazing MMORPG.","April 19","true","336.5"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

In that time, I've racked up a collection of rares and legendaries worth about $500 without any special effort to min-max, or to play the Auction House (player market). Since this is a proper *Trading* Card Game, (not merely a CCG), that $500 isn't an idle figure, either - if I wanted to cash out tomorrow, I could cover all my utility bills for a couple months!\n\n"So what," you say, "it's $500."

I could have made more in a minimum-wage retail job for the time I've spent on the game.\n\nBut I haven't been slaving away at minimum wage; I've been having an absolute blast with the most innovative card game available today, filling up all 10 character slots available right now with max-level characters spanning 8 races and 3 classes, participating in both official and community-run tournaments, and opening dozens and dozens of packs... all without dropping a dime!\n\nCheck out HEX today!

Well, if these people bothered to follow it's progress they'd know the developers never stated it was finished, at all. This is simply the Steam release to reach a broader audience. Yes:\n\n1) The Mass Multiplayer part is not in the game yet\n2) The Rest of PVE and dungeons is not yet in game\n3) Set 4 is coming soon but is not in the game yet\n4) Keeps, raids and set equipment card bonuses are in early stages\n\nAt the end of the day, it's a FTP game with zero P2W, zero microtransaction nonsense (MTs are easy and relatively simple/minimal) and the devs have been up front about it's payment and development model since day one. Don't read into misinformed negativity, give this a go and you will see the already superb potential this games has.\n\n**Current Review**\n\nI have only just started playing this on steam hence the low game time, however, I've invested over a 50 hours into PVP and a further 25 into the first interation of PVE and wow, this game is some seriously great stuff.\n\nTo address a concern for potential players, Hex community and feedback from us has allowed for standardization in pricing of in game currency for this version and the none steam version so we get exactly the same amounts and pricing, I believe this was cause for the majority of negative reviews however this has been FIXED! So please disregard those reviews. This is what it means for a game to have great developers who LISTEN to feedback, thank you devs!\n\nOnto the game. This is probably the first TCG game than has a fully fledged, single player PVE campaign against the AI entering into the world on entrath and wow is it fun. Brand new mechanics for this digital only TCG allow never before seen card combos, abilities, traits and functions such as planting spawning spiderling kinds in opponents decks or bombs/traps and other "on draw" cards, things such as card evolution and cloning and morphing without the need for the actual morphed card to be present in decks, multi stackable effects that can bounce around the game board and so much more. This game will feel very familiar and easy to pick up for any MTG or Duels/Planeswalkers players, except the difference here is, MORE CARDS, fully moddable decks, equipment, champions and abilities, player run eco system and well designed auction house, a plethora of card types, abilities, upgrades and extended art and even progressive abilities for escalation or "build up" style decks. Anything you can imagine to play, pretty much, you get.\n\nIn short, this game has been lovingly supported by both devs and community to form what you see here today, with even more FREE expansive content updates coming soon such as Primal Dawn, it's save to say, this is the best FTP-TCG game you can play to date.\n\nTry it, learn it, embrace it. Plenty of fun to be had here and the best thing is the devs listen to you, listen to feedback, and keep upgrading the experience each time there is a patch. It goes to show that kickstarter, if done right, can truly produce some brilliant games.","April 22","true","3.7"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

Afterwards you begin your "quest" in earnest.\n\nThe thing that stood out the most about HEX is that everything just feels high quality compared to other digital card games. There is a cash shop but there are not adds everywhere shoving premium purchases at you, you dont have cheap looking user interface or graphical bugs everywhere, everything just feels polished and fits.

I've played hundreds of hours in their beta period on their standalone client doing drafts and more recently PvE.\n\nTLDR:  Just plain recommend for PvP and the normal CCG part of the game (ie spending money/packs on drafts or tournaments).  Recommend waiting till more updates with end game features come if you just want to do PvE. I am going to keep playing.\n\nI will not talk about how much I enjoy the game beyond that I find it fun in both the PvE and PvP aspects.  I can't really comment on the Free to Play and how easy/hard it is to make viable decks for PvE without having put money in.  It looks to be a lot of effort, but the PvE is good at handing out small packs with both PvP and PvE cards.  It also hands out individual cards through quests and various interactions with the game map (playing multiple characters is a free way to get a playset of the individual card awards).\n\nI want to talk about how Cryptozoic is adding additional content, the card set schedule, and general updating and patching of the game.\n\nGood news is that they patch and update pretty frequently, and give pretty good notice for when they take the servers down.  They are very communicative with their playerbase, and are really encouraging of community based events.  They would naturally love it if a player decided to stream the game.\n\nI in general like their card set schedule, which is apparently ending up to match Magic's.  I imagine now that it is released on Steam and they have 4 sets (4th Set on April 26, 2016) under their belt they've got a release strategy going.  What I don't know is how often they are going to add PvE content and PvE card sets.  They have made statements, but then they've had to delay before and they will probably have to again.  My outsider perspective is that development has been rough for them.\n\nDon't necessarily go in expecting to be able to hit lvl cap and start doing raids.  Raids don't exist yet, and lvl cap is currently lvl 9 of I believe 30.  Multiple of the stated classes are not in the game yet.  Guilds do not exist yet.  Keeps, see their kickstarter for what that is, do not exist yet.  Double backs, again kickstarter, are not in.  Mercenaries, again kickstarter...actually check their website they've changed what mercs will be/do a lot, are just inventory items at the moment.\n\nThey release about two big features a year, and in general touch every previous feature with some polish as well.  One for this year was the first PvE zone, character creation/leveling, story based dungeons.  With that release schedule and now having to release new PvE content several times a year, I imagine they will be feature complete to the kickstarter in mid 2017 to late 2018.\n\nIf you're willing to get in early for PvE, or just want to play PvP drafts/tournaments (ie spend money) I think its a great purchase and a fun CCG that does some real interesting things.  If you want to solely do the PvE, and maybe venture into PvP when you've earned enough packs/currency from the dual currency AH to buy in then I would recommend waiting a year or two and coming back when its more feature complete.","April 22","true","72.6"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","0"

This game is what I've been waiting for, a digital TCG that rivals MTG. I have been playing since very early on, having backed it on kickstarter, and probalby have a few hundred hours in on the stand alone client.\n\nThe game is well thought out mechanically and introduces several mechanics that would be nigh impossible to acomplish in a physical TCG, however these mechanics are far from mere gimmicks. While you have cards such as Cosmic Transmogrifier which turn their entire board into a chaos of random cards, you also have mechanics such as escalate and prophecy, which buff cards that are still in your deck, and cards which can add new cards to your deck which don't even exist outside the instance of the game. Cards retaining their buffs and debuffs permanantly is a feature that really shakes things up. If you're playing against an opponent who uses cards which can be brought back to life, killing the 1/1 they buffed to a 10/10 might not be enough when he comes back with all the buffs still intact. Indeed, a lot of cards affect eachother before they even hit the field, modifying the cards in your hand and deck adds an interesting layer of strategy to the game.\n\nAnother nice addition in Hex is the PvE elements. Currently only the first chapter of the campaign is inplace, but players can choose from 4 races and 3 classes, soon to be expanded to more options, and these race/class compinations have large effects on your decks, from deciding which cards you cna use to buffing certain aspects of cards and your own character. Having the PvE seperate from the PvP also gives Hex the oppretunity to create insane cards that would be considered too unruly or imbalanced for tournament play, many PvE cards have super fun mechanics, such as Holiday which can become a random troop each turn, or are just insanely powerful, such as Wraith of Zaakir which turns you into an almight dragon cabable of incinerating your opponent's troops.\n\nAll in all I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of TCGs. Yes, you have to buy cards if you want to compete, but you have to in any TCG, and with packs only costing 2USD, it's probably one of the cheapest ones out there. Not to mention the regular draft tournaments being played, and the active and involved community. This makes it a no-brainer to any TCG fan who wants to play a game which they don't need to drive to the card shop anad hope someone is playing.","April 19","true","243.7"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

I come from a TCG background, mostly MTG and WOW-TCG.\n\nFor me this game is everything Hearthstone and Magic Online is not. Hearthstone has to shallow rules, Magic Online is unpolished and expensive. Don't get me wrong, decks in HEX can cost a bit of money. But a draft is around 7$, compared to about twice that on Magic Online. Cards hold value (some are 30+$) and I feel like I don't loose the money I invest like I did in Hearthstone.\n\nCompetitive play is good in HEX. There are drafts fiering often, Gauntlets doesn't have waiting times that are to long. There can be a bit of wait during off-times, but on primetime you can get your competative fix quickly. There are also free touranments with 100+ players each weekend (confirmed for at least 2 more months at the time I'm writing this)\n\nThe game has problems. The developer, HEX Entertainment is new with developing games and it shows. There are bugs, and have been delays in features. But one thing they have shown throughout the entire lifetime of the game is that they want to do right by the players. Another thing is the passion. You can feel how passionate the developers are when playing.\n\nThe community is probably one of the best I've been a part of.

I have played a vast majority of TCGs at the highest level for most of my adult gaming life.  I have never played a game that has as much promise has Hex does.  There are obvious parallels drawn to Magic, and they're not off-base in the respect that the foundation for Hex is similar to Magic.  However, after getting past the core premise, the game diverges in significant ways.\n\nThe easy comparison is to discuss some of the PvP aspects, which includes Booster Draft, Sealed Deck, and Constructed formats.  Hex also has an asynchronous 'Gauntlet' tournament format which is similar to Hearthstone Arena.  You get to play at your convenience.  Since a lot of the keywords are similar, and the match structure is similar, PvP Hex does feel like Magic.  A better version (obviously that's my opinion), but it is similar.  Especially with the last 2 sets (and the upcoming 4th set which is about to release) the Hex team has expanded the scope of the cards in ways that a physical TCG just can't do, whether it be putting cards into your opponents decks, making permanent changes to cards in decks, etc.\n\nHowever, currently where Hex really sets itself apart is in its PvE offerings.  It's taken a bit longer than most anticipated getting off the ground, but the Hex single-player experience truly has a robust offering of matches.  You can change your deck in ways that are just not possible in paper tcgs.  Equipment that you obtain (through single player content primarily) modify cards in your deck.  There are PvE-specific cards that can have ultra powerful effects on the game, that just can't happen in PvP due to power constraints.\n\nI could literally type pages about the bright future of Hex, but I'll just summarize with the standard Pros/Cons\n\nPros:\n- Healthy PvP metagame, vital to the success of any TCG\n- Robust single-player experience, truly a focus for the Hex team\n- Cards have real value:  while entry to PvP _generally_ isn't free, this is mitigated by the fact that cards have real world value.\n\nCons:\n- A less-than desirable delay between sets, that is shortening with greater amounts of framework being laid each expansion\n- The servers don't seem quite set up to handle the large influx of Steam players nonstop.  New players need to note: this is not the norm.  The servers are just being worked hard due to a lot of new players.

It removes the need to track your land instead using a Threshold system where you burn a resource card to gain a resource. Colors are managed through the same system whereupon spending the resource card you can a gem of the matching color. Most cards have a "gem requirement" that you have to mee to play them. In addition, it makes great use of the digital aspect of the game in terms of card abilities. Examples of this are cards that randomly generate a troop of a certain from the whole game inventory of cards, something that would be impossible in a physical game. Another example is the keyword "Prophecy" which gives a boost to the next troop in your deck.\n\nBeyond core gameplay, Hex does a great job of managing the player turns and windows of opportunity. Hearthstone addressed the challenges of a digital TCG by doing away with these windows. Hex has tried to preserve them but focused on making it very easy to stay aware of the ♥♥♥-for-tat back and forth of passing on your opponents turn.\n\nWhat makes Hex special?\n\nBesides being the best serious TCG in digital format (real life value of cards, streamlined play, unique setting, factions and art) Hex is unique because of its RPG elements.\n\nThere is a PvE campaign where your character levels up, gains skills/talents, and provides unique deck encounters.\nCards can be upgraded with Gems that give them unique abilities.\nYour avatar can wear equipment which changes the function of cards in meaningful ways.\n\n\nHex's community is also the best in terms of engagement, helpfulness, and passion amongst all of the digital TCGs.\n\n\nBottom Line: If you like strategy and card games there is no better choice than Hex.","May 10","true","12.6"," 23 of 33 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","23","33","0","0"

Allows you to respond to opponent instead of playing solitaire, then going AFK on opponent's turn. That might be a pro or a con depending on what kind of game you are looking for.\n-The cardbase has a lot of interesting and sound mechanics. It is inspired by previous card games and builds upon them with new mechanics.\n-You can trade cards and ingame items. This allows you to build the deck you want and you can trade them away if you change your mind later.\n-The game has draft and sealed formats where you keep all the cards you pick/open. Fun way to expand your collection while playing and allows for the potential to go infinite if you are good enough.\n-PvE allows people to earn things through just playing. You can trade the things you earn in PvE to other players (gold is the most valued).\n-Community is good. People are helpful.\n\nI've been playing for quite a while on the stand-alone client, so my steam game time doesn't reflect my total playtime.

It truly is an amazing digital tcg.\nI won't go into a long rant about why the game is good, many other reviewers do this - there's plenty of material to read. Instead, I'd like to sum up some of the pros and cons:\n\nPros\n+Real tcg, you do not only collect cards, you can trade them or sell them on auction house.\n+PvE content, arena and campaign. Both earns you gold (ingame currency), cards and equipment.\n+Campaign the rpg pve will only grow with time.\n+Competitive - If you like how MTG plays out in competitive scene, I'm betting you will also like HEX. Being similar is not a bad thing, but do not think HEX a MTG clone, HEX does a lot of things its own way which makes me come to:\n+Digital only TCG. This means HEX has mechanics that is only possible through a digital tcg that can keep track of every buff, debuff and whatnot. Example: Arborean Rootfather ability - 2cost, shuffle it back into the deck and give it cost -2, then draw a card. In a physical tcg if you had multiple copies it would not be easily possible to know which of them had the cost -2.\n+Free to play IS possible, also in a competitive scene. However, do not expect it to come rushing in. It takes time, effort, some luck and skill. The beginning is the slowest, but once you get into limited and if you are skilled enough AND can play the auction house you can quickly earn more than you spend. Personally half (and probably a little more) of my card collection is through free to play and where I have been paying has been at the beginning to get started up faster and when I did not want to put in the time and effort to earn myself the platinum and/or cards.\n+Complicated. HEX has a lot of depth - you will go into mind games vs. your opponent and choosing the right course of action is a lot more difficult than you would think. This also adds a lot of fun to it, since it is not always so straight forward and your action current turn can make you lose the next, or the one after that.\n+UI, Graphics and Sound - they are all excellent. UI is smooth, graphics are nice on the eyes - every function is well polished. It is a great experience overall.\n+Content in both PvE and PvP will keep getting expanded.\n+Support. The hex support team is AMAZING. Are you having a bug during a draft or sealed? Well, you're in luck, because they are very willing to compensate you fully. All you have to do is go to their support site, login and write a ticket and fill in details (it is important to fill in the # of your tournament).\n+The community. HEX has absolutely the best community I have ever experienced in any game. They are helpful, generous, mature and generally nice people. Especially those who are part of the twitch community on hex. I can highly recommend the hex streamers on twitch and have a chat. There's also usually giveaways on various streams for cards or drafts. Also a great place to learn - check it out. No seriously, check it out!\n\nCons\n-Waiting time. I love the game, but they can be very slow at releasing new content and fixing bugs. I'm hopeful though, now that they got their core mechanics (with coding) and PvE campaign it's reasonable to believe content will be released in a more steady flow than previously.\n-Complicated. Learning all the mechanics will take time and effort. It is difficult. You have to use your head. You need to learn keywords, priority steps, when to do what, what happens when I do this in response, the list goes on. Even after more than a year I learn new tricks - I do find this _fun_, but getting fundamentals at the beginning can be a frustrating experience for some. Do not give up, get into it and ask around for help or look at guides. Help is everywhere!\n-Bugs. Being a digital TCG means bugs will be inevitable. Some are worse than others, but sometimes they stick around for longer than I would like. However, this has not made me want to stop the game, as their support team is insanely good.\n\nGive it a swing, it's free to play after all - but do expect to either spend a lot of time or put in some money if you want to join the competitive scene. I do hope the review helped :-)\n\nEdit: Added a few extra Pros that I at the time did not consider.","April 19","true","150.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

It is yet too early to say, the number of cards is a bit low yet, but it has a lot going for it. The mechanics are very similar, and there are already some great synergies and combos to discover that are immensely satisfying.\n\nThere are also a number of new mechanics that would be either impossible or at the least very cumbersome to implement in an actual card game.\n\nI also like the PvE campaign a lot, which can help you discover new strategies and will earn you cards in the process, most of which can be carried over straight into PvP without paying a cent (some of them would be a little too powerful to take into pvp I guess, the recruiters for example which lower the cost of your troops by one so long as they remain in play. Stackable, naturally)\n\nThe biggest thing for me in comparison to MTG for me is that you get to pick a champion (PvP, skills are set) or hero (PvE, can be leveled, has an awesome talent tree that can really make certain themed decks a lot more efficient). I'm liking this a lot.\n\nMy biggest wish is that they'll expand on the available PvE classes, Mage, Warrior, Cleric, are available already, and they play refreshingly differently. There are cards and talents with a trigger that reads "If X shares a class with you". Looking at the cards I expect there is room for a warlock, ranger, and rogue class. I do pray these will be implemented in the future, I am already making up combos in my head for the class based cards alone. I'm also very curious what their talents would be.\n\nIf this gets expanded while maintaining the already very high quality in pretty much every aspect, I can see myself playing tournaments in the future.","May 19","true","97.5"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","1"

It provides unique blend of PvE and PvP experience to new and experienced players. You start game by choosing your race (free starter deck) and after that you can go PvE to get more and different cards and equipement. Here are many races, many champions and different classes.\nCampaign is interesting and after you finish it you just want more of story, lore and campaign. If this is not enough for you to try it there is also Auction House where you can buy and sell cards, equipment, packs, chests etc. Also you can use dust to make your cards textless :)\n\nPvP is interesting and here are also different tournaments like draft and constructed. Although, constructed PvP requires lots of time or money I find myself enjoying drafts as manily F2P player because everybody starts from unopened boosters and nobody knows what will they get. So you open boosters, pick cards, make deck and hopefully win games so you can get new boosters. That's right if you compete and you are sucessfull you can get boosters.\n\nThere are two currency available to you.\nGold - earned by playing against coputer AI or so called PvE\nPlatinum - you buy platinum for real money or you sell you earned gold for platinum\nWhile playing PvE and clearing Frost Ring Arena you earn gold and cards. You can then sell your earned gold at trade chat or even use gold to buy boosters from auction house.\n(Tip1: after you buy booster for gold you can put them on auction house for platinum and earn real money currency.)\n\nVerdict:\nIf you are TCG lover and card enthusiast, join today and start collecting you cards, equipement and make decks because this is the ONLY and the best REAL digital TCG available for you to play.\n\n(Tip2: Visit http://hex.tcgbrowser.com and sync you card collection, decks, equipement and find good P2P trades)\n\nCheers!","April 20","true","212.3"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

Pve is fun and interesting but some combos give huge road blocks that are difficult to pass without long hours of grinding. Good community. Nice amount of customizing and synergy with cards. A game that actually IS FTP.\n\nThis is coming from a person with no tcg background.\n\nAs said, I've never played any other tcg before but I was able to get into this one fairly well. The game features RPG elements along with pvp elements which seen to mesh pretty well. You can use the pve or campaign mode to collect some cards and money. You can then take the cards you're not using and sell them at the auction house (more on that later.) The gold can be traded to other players for platinum through the trade window quick, IMHO, works better than the auction house.\n\nFrom the earnings here you can go to the store and buy different booster packs or sleeves, (things that make the back of the cards look different) for the plat or gold. If that method is too slow for you then you can always spend real money for what you want, though it doesn't really necessitate spending real money.\n\n\nThe auction house is a mess if you ask me. They have different options to sort through cards but you still end up with 20 different pages of the same card. If you are out bid on a card you'll get mail letting you know but no link to that specific cards again I'd your care about that sort of thing.\n\nMany people have negative reviews because of the servers going down when it first launched on steam and it's true they did go down but since then have stabilized so it's a non issue. That isn't too say there aren't issues with the mail but they get resolved within a reasonable amount of time. It is an mmo after all so expect things to happen. The cow of the game is fun. I don't know about them copy pasting from another game and honestly don't really care. The game is fun and the community is helpful. The Devs also are interactive with everyone in chat add well. There's one that had answered so many of my questions I feel like we're on first name bases now lol. Thanks noble!\n\nPeople have also started to say the game is going to sink because of the company over top it. I don't know anything about this company and don't care. I care about what the game is now and now it's good. That's like jumping off a boat because you think it's going sink even though there isn't a hole in it and no clouds in the sky.\n\nNow the things that get under my skin. There are certain parts of the campaign that don't make to much sense to me. For instance, masonry it where not all cards in your collection are available for you to use our limiting the amount. I'm not talking about only having 3 or 4 cards of a set type in your deck. I'm talking about only being allowed 1 common names card instead of allowing all 3 of your commons from that name to be in your deck. If I'm lvl 3 I'm limited to having 1 common no shard card off a given name in my deck. If I'm lvl 4 I'm allowed 2. For some classes/races this makes some of the fights near impossible because they don't allow you to use the card in your collection that would allow you to pass this. Simply lvling up doesn't really work when you're race/class doesn't get an xp boost so you're only getting 40xp per battle and you need over 2000 for a lvl. This is coming from an avid jrpg gamer. (I own more than what is on my steam account for those who are currently checking my games.)\n\nGood game, good devs good fun.  Don't pass it up.","May 3","true","85.3"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","23","34","0","0"

Many of the concepts delivered by the game truly push the envelope on what a digital TCG is capable of.  While traditional paper TCGs are held back by the logistics of real-world constraints, Hex is constantly innovating on what being a digital game is all about.  A card might secretly show you your opponent's hand without them knowing, a card might constantly generate spirits to fill your deck, or a card could create a random card out of thin-air; all things that are cumbersome or impossible to do in a traditional paper TCG.\n\nThe RPG elements of the game manifest themselves in a way that makes playing a joy.  In the beginning of the PvE campaign, players are required to create a new character that contains several RPG tropes.  Characters gain levels, earn talents, unlock abilities, and earn equipment which can be used to boost the power of their cards and deck.  Players progress through a map encountering different characters and challenges that put their skills to the test.  While there is a general storyline to be followed, the map has several opportunities for players to explore "off the beaten path" with many optional challenges and dangers to be conquered.  Defeating encounters rewards the player with Gold (Hex's free to play currency), new PvE cards, and equipment.  Several other collectibles are available as well, such as Stardust for extending the art of your cards or sleeves to swag out your deck.\n\nVeterans to TCGs will find a game with a wonderful amount of strategic depth to scratch the itch of any deck builder.  Cards with sockets allow gems to be socketed into the cards, drastically changing the effect of a card.  A socketed card could spawn a rhino when it deals damage to an opponent, or that same card could deal direct damage to an opponent with a different gem.  This unique take on card customization is a wonderful idea that further emphasizes the fantastic digital nature of the game.  Also as mentioned, there are hundreds of pieces of equipment to collect and use.  Equipment can change the effect of the card from boosting its raw stats to generating some new ability or effect on the card.  Cards that you initially pass up may instead suddenly become relevant as you find a piece of equipment to boost the effectiveness of the card.  This is an interesting addition to the game, as cards that would normally be overlooked in favor of more traditionally "stronger" cards may instead be worth giving a second look.\n\nA blossoming competitive community Although the PvE portion of the game is likely enough to satisfy many folks, many players are more interested in crushing their enemies on the field of battle.  Hex has both good and downsides in this endeavor.  Hex offers several tournament styles and play modes to test your mettle.  Limited players from other games like MTG and Hearthstone will be happy to find that both Draft and Sealed modes are available in Hex.  Even better, with a paltry $2 booster pack cost, drafts can be played with a minimal cost investment.  Other tournaments such as Constructed or Gauntlet (Hex's version of asynchronous tournaments) are available as well.  The wide variety of ways to compete is definitely a plus, ensuring that there is a competitive mode for everyone in the game.\n\nSeveral community run tournaments are also available - generally free to enter - which enable players to get a taste of competitive play without having to potentially buy-in with real cash.  Hex has also dedicated itself to having higher-stakes tournaments as well.  Earlier this year, the first Hex Invitational Tournament was held with a prize total of $100,000.  With a focus on cultivating the competitive scene, Hex is likely to continue to develop into a game with many high level tournaments for the most hardcore competitive players among us.\n\nTime, Money, and Value Hex bills itself as a free-to-play game.  This is somewhat misleading, as new players to the game may see the free-to-play tag and immediately cry foul when they go up against an established player with a well-tuned deck.  While the PvE portion of the game is indeed free and full of content, players should expect to invest either their time or money if they want to pursue some of the more competitive aspects of the game.  Luckily, Hex makes this relatively easy to do with several avenues to accrue value.  Gold from the PvE portion of the game is often coveted by PvP players for their ability to purchase stardust or spin the Wheels of Fate.  The game does a wonderful job of providing potential value and "feel-good" opportunities within the game.  For example, booster packs purchased in the game also have a small chance to come with a bonus "Primal Pack" - a bonus booster pack that is filled with all rares and legendaries!  Another interesting feature is that each booster pack also includes a treasure chest.  These treasure chests come in a variety of rarities and contain everything from Cards, to Equipment, or in some cases - even another booster pack to start the process over again!  Treasure chests can also be "spun" on the Wheels of Fate; essentially a slot machine paid for with gold earned in the Free to Play portion of the game for a chance to upgrade your treasure chest or get other goodies.  Players can spin into rare cards, powerful PvE cards, or even more booster packs!\n\nThe value packed into a single booster pack in the game truly is one of the better features of the game, allowing for maximum amount of enjoyment for a reasonable cost.  While other digital games have no concept of value since cards cannot be traded, Hex's economy ensures that most cards retain some value whether its due to their PvP viability or their potential use in PvE; an interesting duality that helps keep cards relevant.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nHex is a game with a bright future.  A kickstarted game that continues to grow, it has overcome many challenges in its short lifespan.  The PvE portion continues to grow with future updates planned and the continual release of new sets ensures that the game remains fresh.  Hex has struggled to release content in a standardized timeframe, but this is to be expected with a new indie company finding their footing and building their core systems.  Fresh out of the beta stages, Hex is a game that can only continue to become more immense as more features continue to be implemented.  With a fantastic community of helpful players - I urge you to give Hex a try.  Odds are it will draw you into the game with its innovation, beautiful artwork, and depth.\n\nVerdict: Recommend","April 19","true","0.5"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","17","23","2","1"

Its a true tcg unlike most tcgs that are around the net. There is no energy system that limits your game play like some "tcg" i've played.  You're able to trade with people the cards you have, gift them or even sell them on the action house. The community is awesome. Helpful to new players and just great people.  You don't have to spend real money on the game unless you want to. They have it set up that you can grind for gold and trade your gold to people for plat the real money currency. Thats one thing I find awesome about it. You're able to trade plat straight up. They don't make it so you can't trade it or the items you get with plat like other games. So its all about if you rather spend your time to grind for it or just spend the cash straight up.\n\nThe only negative things i can say about the game are it gets laggy at times. With it being added to steam there has been a giant influx of players which has caused some problems here and there but things have been getting better on that front too. The chat is like my least favorite think about the game but thats going to get improved somewhere down the line.

A fun card game that will be very familiar to anyone familiar with MTG.\n\nA lot of the mechanics are fairly unique and would only work well with a PC version of a card game - the art is wildly varied and pretty fun to look at. The decks feel familiar with regards to color, but also do have their own bits of nuance.\n\nMost of all, though, I personally love the addition of a 'character' atop it all - complete with talents and equipment that affect your cards, troops, etc. Clerics are biased towards blessings and buffs, Mages are big on actions/instants, and Warriors bolster troops nicely.\n\nThere's also a seemingly pretty robust single player campaign, which rewards you with cards and boosters as you go along - and they don't appear to be totally static as far as what you get.\n\nMy only complaint is some of the UI/click actions are a hint delayed feeling and sluggish, but that's really it. Again, the neat mechanics are what make it for me - stacking buffs to the next card of a certain type you draw, cards that scoot up in your deck as turns pass, creation of 'random' cards (any card, not just ones you own), etc.\n\nThere's also a nuance in their resource system - it's essentially like MTG with one big difference. In Hex, cards just have a flat cost, i.e. 4 'resource', much like MTG. In MTG however, you might need a total of 3, but two had to be blue. In Hex, you may only have gotten two blue 'resources', but all your resource is lumped into an overall pool, and the colors add a 'threshold.'\n\nMeaning that if you had gotten 2 blue and 5 white, you'd have a total of 7 resource, with a 5 threshold on white and a 2 threshold on blue. As such, you can cast two cards that cost 3 each, even if both require 2 blue, because you meet the 'threshold' amount for those cards. It's a subtle difference but it makes decks a lot friendlier to multicolor and you don't end up getting cornered by needing one more of a color or another as desperately. Most cards I've seen only need one or two threshold, so a multicolor deck can easily squeeze by with just one or two of a resource with a bit of bad luck far longer than you could in MTG!\n\nAll in all very fun, great art, lots of interesting mechanics. Solid recommend in my opinion!","April 25","true","10.6"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","18","25","0","0"

In a post i read that a game HEX had a kickstarter and soon the alpha will be released for backers.

It attempts to merge the trappings of an MMORPG with the infinite expansion of a TCG, and it is mostly successful. In the game’s current state, the MMO aspect is quite weak, while the TCG gameplay is quite strong. By being a digital only game, HEX can break some of the genre tropes and do crazy things like seeding an opponent’s deck with spiders that fight for you when drawn, or providing a small percentage chance that a card in your deck will enter the battlefield upon gaining health. Each set expansion has only made the gameplay more interesting and increased the creativity of the digital only aspect of the game.\n\nThe MMORPG Aspect:\nWhat distinguishes HEX from other online TCGs is the MMORPG portion of its game. While HEX is an excellent RPG, the MMO aspect is lacking. There is no required player interaction, and no way to see other players within the world itself. The campaign feels like a strong single player RPG, but currently has no way for players to have any meaningful interaction beyond strategy discussions and card trading. You cannot see where are players are in the world, and all chat is done through a single chat channel, or through private conversations between friends. For an MMO it feels lonely.\nThat being said, the RPG aspect is great! The player travels through the world on a node based map, with each node being either a combat/story encounter or a town or dungeon. Towns serve little purpose, other than a place to gather and turn in quests. Dungeons are repeatable zones with their own unique maps and rewards for completion. Rewards for encounters and dungeons range from gold (usable on the auction house to purchase new cards) to new cards and equipment. Equipment is what truly sets HEX apart from the competition in terms of TCGs. Each piece of equipment affects a different card and can drastically change how it is used in combat. Equipment can only be used in the RPG portion of the game, and has no effect in PVP, as it would destabilize the careful balance going on there.\n\nThe TCG Aspect:\nAnyone familiar with Magic, or the now defunct WoW TCG (not Hearthstone), will be able to immediately pickup HEX and grasp the core concepts. Players play resource cards to afford bigger and better cards until one player is crushed by the strength of the other. In HEX, each player takes on the role of a Champion from the greater HEX lore, each of which has their own unique special ability which can be triggered when certain conditions are met (similar to Hearthstone). Thus, a deck can be built around a specific champion, or a champion can be chosen to compliment a deck composition.\nWhere things get really interesting are in the different abilities that cards can have. Health stealing, instant attacking, and early striking are genre staples, but HEX introduces numerous abilities that are only really manageable in a computer run TCG. Escalation, the newest ability doubles a card’s printed numerical value (including its cost) but only while the card is still in hand. Tunneling allows a card to be placed on the field for a reduced cost, but with a timer until it is revealed and usable. My favorite abilities revolve around providing a stat boost to all cards of a specific type regardless of where they are located, in my hand, deck, graveyard, or field. This allows me to buff up cards that I have yet to play or even draw, allowing for a big surprise when I finally play a low cost troop with numerous buffs that result in a heavy hitter.\n\nThe PVP Aspect:\nI have not taken the deep dive into the PVP aspect of the game, beyond some friendly matches against friends and a couple of tournaments. There are numerous way to play PVP and plenty of rewards for playing. It is common to get crushed by players who have spent hundreds of dollars on their decks, and that is the aspect which has kept me out of the TCG scene up until this point. For me, there is enough content, and opportunity to earn free cards in the RPG portion of the game, that I don’t need to rely on PVP.\n\nPros:\n+ Strong RPG gameplay\n+ Tough puzzles in the RPG (Require creative deck building)\n+ Class and Race combos\n+ Variety of gameplay styles\n+ Easy to play completely free (though with a grind)\n+ More content incoming\n+ Encourages alt characters\n\nCons:\n- Weak MMO implementation\n- Pay to win PVP\n- Class imbalance (Mage = hard mode, Cleric = easy mode)\n- No guild system (Promised, but not yet implemented)\n- No player interaction required (Promised, but not yet implemented)\n- PVE can be a grind\n","May 14","true","15.9"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","19","27","0","0"

The game fully use it's virtual component to play with cards in ways physical cards cant, such as manipulating core cards in game, decks composition and effects. For instance you can place booby traps inside your enemy deck, increase cost of cards in his hands, lower stats of cards in his deck, etc.\n\nThe game offer a solid pvp side, which i am mostly unfamiliar with, but there are such things as drafts and tournaments.\n\nThe game also offer a (still in development but the first zone is out) PVE campaign. Some fight feels more like puzzle solving, since you may have to adapt your cards to fit the situation. in others you gotta deal with the situation using your race/class and elements best you can. For instance, an elf gain more hp and increased chances for dust drops from dungeon and other classes have more dungeon lives or are stronger on the last/first lives. The adition of classes and hero to chaperon your deck is also a good way to add additional interactions without making the game much more complex.\n\nEquipment serve to empower cards, a gauntlet effect could be someshing like ' your fireballs cost -1 or deal +2 damage or cause enemies to lose -1 attack, etc. More complex effects are also present, such as causing the equipped card to revert itself after a condition is presented.\n\nThe game offer an auction house where pretty much everything can be bought with gold, that is acquired in pvp vs AI arena and in campaign, and with platinum which is the real money currency.\n\nPlatinum can also be used to buy custom card skins and boosters (campaign also reward zone boosters, which can be sold and oppened)\n\nDeckbuilding is available (similar to mtg), there are already enough cards to see multiple deck types (and heroes) and cards being used in PVP and PVE.\n\nAll in all it is a solid game, the makers like it, so does the players, and it is free!\n\n-Lost","April 19","true","43.6"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

On one hand it is one of the best TCG on the market. It's complex, fun, challenging and has a (mostly) helpful and dedicated community.\n\nOn the other hand it has many problems. Server issues on the steam release, Steep and unforgiving learning curve, unfinnished and unrefined PVE and a PvP that has far too many barriers for entry.\n\nLet's start with the pvp and the barriars you'll face to enter. To be blunt, it costs money to participate in any meaningful pvp. Although this is standard practice in the TCG world, in the world of video games this will bewilder people and put many new players trying pvp particularly when they find that the skill gap between newer players and the players that are obviously dedicated to Hex and TCG's in general is huge. The strange thing is they don't seem to realise how good they are at the game. Even a experienced Magic card player like myself was pushed hard in contructed. Nevertheless as a digital card game trying to simulate the environment of real world TCG with it's rules and market place has left the game with an identity crises of being a F2P video game with a pay to participate TCG model.\n\nHowever, paradoxically PVP is where the game truly shines. If you are an experienced TCGer I could not reccomend this game enough even if it is just to try. The game itself is reminiscent of MtG but with a few twists in the mechanics. Although at times it can get to obsurd levels with over 100 cards on the table in one of my games, it is great fun.\n\nAs for PVE. It's fairly basic although people complain about the difficulty, and in truth there are difficulty spikes all over the place, with practice and some research even f2p players can complete the campaign. However, I would not reccomend this game for players that are new to TCGs. It simply does not do a good job of teaching new players the game and does not open an easy gateway for new players to introduce themselves to PVP. To be frank, without a large playerbase with large population of low skilled players, this game will always struggle retain players trying to get into Hex.\n\nBut if you have a will of iron and a willing to improve yourself I would reccomend this game. If not, then this is definetely not the game for you.","May 12","true","46.7"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","21","31","0","0"

Anyone that is even slightly familiar with any big TCGs knows that it costs money for new packs and to play in offical tourneys and drafts (anyone that has gone to a single Friday Night Magic knows this). This is the paid content that keeps this game alive and generates new content. Again, this isnt new to anyone thats ever played a physical TCG.\n\n-The only pay to play portion of this game is to buy brand new packs and participate in offical tourneys, which is comparable or even less than playing a standard draft or tourney in your local shop. As a reward for participating in theses tourneys you often get your money back in the form of packs rewarded based off how well you did.\n\n-Everything else is free. Duels, campaigns, dungeons, frost ring arena (a type of gauntlet where you duel progressively harder decks),  Unoffical tourneys (there are several websites dedicated to these and offer some very nice prizes), you can buy cards, mercenaries, equipment, chests, and even second hand unopened packs, all for the free in game currency you get for just playing.\n\n-You can play this game for free and have an excellent time doing it, using the in game gold you earn to buy cards and second hand unoppened packs to build awesome decks off the AH. However you can pay for some Plat and have it go even further, individual cards are quite cheap but should you choose so, this hobby can cost you just as much as Magic should you decide to compete in drafts, and tourneys just like at a Friday Night Magic.\n\nThe game itself is without a doubt best and most thought out TCG out there, counting both its digital and physical competition. It has rewarding mechanics, a great community, amazing art and borrows enough from MTG to feel familiar but improves on so much to make it its own thing. For a more indepth review there are plenty better ones, and I would recommend watching some duels to really get the feel of it but I wanted to help clear any confusion for those that may not be familiar with how large/successful TCGs work.\n\nThis game is out but only has a fraction of its planned content, it will get much better in time with additional formats like double headed dragon, anything goes (where you can use your pve cards against eachother),  the inclusion of crafting, clans, clan decks, clan pvp, raids and a much larger pve campaign.","June 4","true","45.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rednightmare/recommended/410380/","rednightmare","Dan Hellsing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rednightmare/","600 products in account","This is essentially Magic: The Gathering with a few additional mechanics that wouldn't be easily implemented in a physical format card game. The game flow is almost exactly the same as MTG with the major differences being:\n\n- Mana (gems in Hex) have a smoother curve overall and there is less management of it.\n- There are heroes similar to what you have in Hearthstone with unique abilities, health totals and so forth.\n\nAside from that you are more or less playing Magic. Even the gem colors/strategies are copied from Magic so if you like to play Red/White Aggro in MTG then R/W Aggro is going to be pretty damn similar in Hex. Blue control? Yep, it's here. All of the general tendencies and basic strategies are very similar across both games.\n\nNow, I like MTG. I played it for years. The MTGO client has always been a bit... special and it definitely isn't as beginner friendly as Hex because there is single player campaign mode. Even the standalone annual MTG games can't compare to the campaign mode in Hex. That said, Hex doesn't have that great of a client either. It's slow and not particularly responsive. The store is clunky and the auction/marketplace is downright painful to use.\n\nHex also lacks in the format department in comparison to MTG, so don't expect a lot of options outside of basic drafting and constructed. You won't see anything like EDH in Hex, at least not yet.\n\nTo sum up: Do you like Magic: The Gathering? Yes? Then you will like Hex. It's cheaper and the client is slightly better. No? Move along and give SolForge or Hearthstone a try. (Definitely try SolForge. It's a great game and it plays FAST.)","April 28","true","13.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

CHECK! RPG? YUP! MMO? Si!\n\nThis game is straight fun! This is a Trading Card Game, with a bunch of twists. Did you play any card games as a kid? Pokemon, YuGiHo, Duel Master, Harry Potter, Magic, the list goes on and if you did I would highly recommend giving this game a try. The best way to describe this game is a deeper, more fun hearthstone, BUT WITH TRADING! Seriously, no more getting a legendary for a class you don't play and having to destroy it for a 1/4th of its value! Another description would be a cheaper Magic the Gathering (2$ booster packs v. 4$ packs), with an online version that doesn't make you want to pull your hair out.\n\nWhat makes this game unique????\n\nAuction house! - from rages to riches, sell/trade using gold (farmable currancy) and plat (paid currency)\n\nTotally free to play viable! - At first it may not seem like it, but this game is very free to play friendly. It has a deeeeep PVE campaign and arena (which allows you to earn gold). What can you do with gold? Buy stuff on the AH, trade gold directly with other players for plat, and buy packs to open or enter tournaments! Why will paying players want your gold?  Simple, because gold has real value for paid players. Everytime you open a pack you get your 17 cards, and a chest which you can use gold to spin (which is basically a slot machine that can upgrade your chest to another rarity or give you other cool rewards like card sleeves or other cards!\n\nA card game with a story... - Seriously, it is well written and fun to play while teaching you how to play the game even if you are a complete noob! When I started playing I just clicked through the text because I normally don't card about story for games I play, I actually restarted when I figured out how cool and funny the story is.\n\nRPG aspects? - YUP! You can level up your PVE character and put equipment on which dramatically changes cards and can take crap cards to amazing cards! Oh and all the equipment is sellable and buyable on the AH.\n\n\nA few things to note\n---- There are PVE only cards, which at first I thought was kind of lame but I it allows PVE to have overpowered/fun cards without damaging PVP balance.\n---- There have been some server errors when the game launched on steam. These have been resolved, and I haven't had since day 1.\n","April 23","true","224.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Nevertheless the game at this point is very solid and in my opinion one of the best F2P Games. Now, you might have a different opinion what a good F2P game is, but for me its one where the developers actually can make money and the players and especially new players don't feel like playing a P2W game.\nNow hex is a card game, and therefore you are only as good as your cards, and cards cost money. But hex gets around that by nailing the TCG aspect perfectly. You can buy/trade/sell your cards, your items and your packs, something i have never seen in a CCG/TCG game before. Blizzard for example would never let you trade your unwanted cards for free to other players. Hex does that!\nYou can grind for gold, buy a pack from the AH sell it for plat and ... BOOM ... you never spend a dime but got the actually real world money currency in the game, and do with it what you want (pay the entry fee to a tournament for example)\n\nSo in short: The game still misses a lot of features that were promised, but they went with something that allows them to build a community and especially create a business model, and i respect that. The game is solid, the PvE is great fun, PvP is doable especially drafted tournaments. And you are in this game NOT limited by being a F2P player, except for the time sink.","April 24","true","89.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

If you walk away from the game before fully exploring it due to that frustration, you’ll be missing out on one of the best video game / TCG experiences in your lifetime.\n\nOnce you ‘get it’ you’ll find yourself coming back to this game over the years more than any other game in your library.  I promise.  It’s that good.  Better even.\n\nFor those that wave this game off as an MTG clone, they have not really explored it to its full potential.  Yes, the overarching mechanics are very similar and it may take you some time to spot the differences, but once you do, oh boy, the game opens up to you in ways that no other TCG can, MTG included.  One thing to note though, beyond the PvE portion, if you approach this game as a TCG only, it can bankrupt you in boosters just like MTG, so approach that aspect of the game with caution if you have a ‘I must collect everything’ mentality.\n\nThere have been some that have gotten full sets without spending a dime on skill alone but for most people if you want to experience the thrill of PvP tournaments with prizes against some of the friendliest competitors around, you’ll probably have to spend about 5 to 7 USD or more per tournament.  I did not approach this game as a PvP player, but I am now addicted to PvP play (even though I stink) and in my many losses I have never walked away without thinking it isn’t money well spent (for most tournaments you end up with a lot of valuable tradable cards even when losing).\n\nThen there is PvE which is just beginning (there is currently about 10-15 hours of content, with hundreds of more hours to come over the next few years) and that requires no money at all – as someone with a full collection of the first three sets, I find the experience a lot more fun not relying on my card library and using a PvE character’s free card pool.  I’ve read some reviews that say it takes too long to grind for cards, but all of those reviews seem to be from people grinding to enter the completely separate PvP tournaments which start at 5 to 7 USD, so yeah, it’ll take you a bit to make money out of thin air.\n\nYou’ll hear some people complain that there are PvE battles that are ‘too difficult’ – and for many people, yeah, they are right.  None of those battles are required to progress through the PvE campaign and all of them can be won without purchasing any cards or boosters and are designed to test your mettle and rely on a bit of luck; if you do win them, you can walk away with some valuable prizes you can turn around on the Auction House or keep in your collection to excel at the next PvE campaign release.\n\nOnto the more negative part of this review, if you do get hooked to the game I’d suggest you ignore all of the hype for the upcoming features they say are coming beyond the card set and PvE campaign releases (and PvE campaigns and PvP card set releases are still far from consistent).  Those crazy features?  Crazy awesome!  And you’ll drive yourself mad if you learn about them because it’ll sound like those features are just around the corner but who in the hell knows when they’ll actually have time to code them into the game.  Yes, they are working on them, yes, they have shown steady progress and dedication on those features, but the game stands on its own without them and you’ll be better off being surprised when they do eventually come rather than be disappointed when a feature date is missed.  The company cares about the community but gets too caught up in its own hype and consistently misses their deadlines.  They have shown, however, that they listen to the community and have reversed more than a few poor decisions based upon the active player base.  They really seem to care first and foremost in producing a ‘fun experience’ for the players rather than raking in cash.\n\nAnd man oh man is the experience fun; give it some time and patience you will be rewarded.\n","April 22","true","54.2"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

This game does a decent job of hiding the "grind", a few posts have complained about on Reddit, and instead offers an engaging campaign to introduce new players.\n\nThe campaign of Hex allows the user to select a hero to level up, make choices that affect his/her game play, become familiar with the game, and obtain the sweet loot after a successful match (or at least the illusion of sweet loot). I'm about 5 hours into the campaign and I don't see myself slowing down until I finish it.\n\nThe other PVE aspect of Hex is an Arena mode. The arena allows you 3 losses to varied opponents before you game over keeping all the loot you have won. You can cash out your winnings at anytime before the 3rd loss. There is no entry cost to the PVE arena. Considering that the opponents appear to be the same every time, I can see this getting repetitive quickly. I think it would be more enjoyable to reduce the encounters from 20 to 10 and add more varied opponents per run.\n\nIf you're new and you want to see more of what this game has to offer, check out my impressions/review of the PVE at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6RZoP8HGWw","April 24","true","9.6"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

If this is the first time you've seen this game, you're in for a treat. I think one of the most prohibitive things about TCGs is the cost and accessibility of getting to play them in the first place. Perhaps you don't live near a gaming store that hosts things like friday night magic. Perhaps you don't really have the money to drop on expensive booster packs in physical tcgs.\n\nThe great thing about HEX is it addresses all those things. Booster packs (bought straight from gameforge, not from steam) are at most 2 dollars each, much cheaper than any physical tcg, with a minimum of 15 cards per pack. Plus, a great bonus of playing online is a bit hidden from view, but the math checks out:\n\nDONT OPEN YOUR BOOSTER PACKS DIRECTLY. Instead, participate in tournaments. Sometimes you'll win some good prizes, other times you'll lose, but that's okay. The entrance fee to a competitive draft tournament in hex, for example, is 3 packs (600 plat) and 100 platinum for a total of 700 platinum (it's a little less than that if you buy packs on the auction house, though). So, we now have 8 people contributing 100 extra plat towards prize money, that's 800 plat total, or 4 packs worth. Well, the prize pool is actually a total of 12 packs, so you'll have a better than 50% chance to walk away with more cards than the plat value you contributed, all in the name of a good tournament!\n\nAnd who knows, maybe you'll do well enough to pay for your next tournament for free! Good play and good deck design is well rewarded in hex.\n\nSo go put away your hearthstone cards, HEX is the digital TCG of champions!\n\nAnd hey, if pvp isn't your thing, multi-user co-op dungeons and raids are coming!","April 20","true","33.0"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

I am no veteran of card games, nor am I one of the die hard fans who backed this game on the kickstarter about 3 years ago. So if you want a more in depth perspective and backstory on development, feel free to ask someone from the community. They are remarkably kind and helpful.\n\nThis game is beautifully constructed. Lots of thought and effort went into building the lore, the PvE battles and cards. It brings new ideas into the card game genre, such as the Hero Equipment concept. You equip your champion with items that will enhance certain cards in your deck, allowing for lots of variation in deck building and (in theory) much more options than other card games.\n\nIn single player Campaign mode, you get to create your own champion, combining one of 8 races and 3 classes. There are 2 factions with 4 races each, and they all take place in the same world map with minor variation in events and location depending on which race you choose. The campaign is where you acquire most of your basic cards to use later in PvP if you wish to do so, although the game never pressures you to go for PvP.\nYou can just single player all day long and have fun by yourself.\n\nHowever, as you progress through the campaign, you begin to realize that the cards you get from campaign rewards do not match the steep dificulty curve of the coming battles. The game throws everything in the kitchen sink at you, with enemy champions using clearly overpowered abilities and troops that require very specific card combinations and synergies to be countered. It's like if your boss at work tells you to "fix this copy machine" but does not give you the tools or finance you need to fix it.\n\nNot only do you need more powerful cards to progress, you need them to synergize well with each other. Since the campaign gives you about 1 rare card for every 3 or 4 battles, and it's usually the same cards every time, you realize this whole situation was built as a grind fest with the ILLUSION of progress.\n\nThe only way to make actual progress through the campaign is to participate in the game's built in economy and start buying the advanced cards that synergize well with each other. And this is where the grind aspect becomes truly monstrous in proportion.\n\nThe community has even created a "guide" for new players advising them on how to grind the campaign and arena properly and progress through the game. I am not even kidding! When I first saw the guide, I genuinely felt sad for this community.\n\nYou can tell they are very passionate about the game because it has so much potential, and I truly sympathize with that. But a good community will never compensate for the fact that the game's economy is too convoluted, cumbersome and slow paced without spending real cash on it.\n\nIt was designed to frustrate the ♥♥♥♥ out of you until you realize "If I want to make any kind of progress, I need to spend some real cash sooner or later". Unless you are playing 5-6 hours every day and get lucky with the campaign rewards, you will never feel like you have the freedom to create multiple functioning and sufficient decks for competitive (or even single player) gameplay. You will always be on the back foot with big holes in your inventory.\n\nIf you don't have the time to play all day long and get what you want, this game is not for you... unless you spend your money on it.\n\nI will NOT call this game pay-to-win, because it's not that at all. The game does offer you a legitimate alternative to get the cards you want without paying real cash.\nInstead, it's actually pay-to-avoid-endless-frustration-and-time-consumption. And that is something I do not like. Just my honest opinion.\n\nI don't like when a "free-to-play" game torments you psychologically into spending your money on it. I prefer to spend money on the game because I LIKE IT AND WANT TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPERS.\n\nHowever, this game gives you no chance to sympathize with the developers. You are expected to pay in order to progress beyond the WALL OF TIME AND DIFFICULTY (WOTAD™), not because you actually feel good while playing. This is the major problem with "free-to-play" games these days. Until they fix this recurring syndrome, this game gets a 5 out of 10 from me.\n\n5/10 Average game with great potential. Keep an eye on it as it improves... hopefully.\nIf you are like me and you don't have time to spend grinding through the game economy, I would not recommend it. Otherwise, go for it.","May 9","false","42.9"," 26 of 43 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","26","43","2","3"

You have options and sidequests, where you can gain cards and money\n-Very good community, ask something in chat and they help you right away.

Even so, this game is 100% worth checking, if you like card games this is a must and about the crashing problems I am not worried about it, remember the game just released on steam so some problems are always normal.

Hex is basically Magic 2.0 (and there's nothing wrong with this). If you think Hearthstone is the right level of complicated then this game isn't right for you.\n\nI've got thousands of hours into this over the past few years. I love it. The release schedule can be slow, but it just means periodically you take a break from it for a few weeks or months and then come back when there's new content. I'm fine with that.\n\nI can't speak much for the PVE. The campaign is a fun 15-20 hours at the moment. But like Magic, if you want to play PVP you're going to have to put a few bucks in to play. If you're any good, the prize-payouts for tournaments are fantastic (much better than Magic) and the game is a lot cheaper to play.","May 9","true","517.6"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","19","30","0","0"

I think they picked a good spot to do the steam release. However there are a few interface things which need more polish.\n\nIn particular in the PvE campaign there are rules for how many cards of a given rarity and which colors you can use with a given race/level that is not very clearly shown. This can be frustrating if you like to plan out your decks heavily in advance or have a 'build' you wanted to try straight off the bat.\n\nBut that is more a challenge for the experienced CCG player and the filtering of total cards I think could be valuable for a newbie to keep from being overwhelmed by deck building choices.\n\nI would give it a 9/10 as the game still has room for improvement, but it is definitely going in the right direction.\n\nMultiplayer PvE is definitely a long awaited feature that was promised and has not yet been released, but from a technical perspective I can definitely see why it's been delayed.","May 16","true","18.8"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

The game makes a claim that it's different than other games, but it's not at all. Players of hearthstone or magic the gathering will feel right at home. You also don't really get to fiddle with much until you complete the first dungeon. The game doesn't tell you this, and you're left wondering, am I stuck with these cards, or how do I change them? But after the first dungeon, the fun begins.\n\nI can only recommend this game if you either don't mind paying for packs for virtual cards, OR you don't mind playing against computer opponents. This game offers a ton of PVE content. You get to select a faction, a race, and a class. There are skills to use, you level up, and each choice in customization has an effect on your game (minus gender which is purely cosmetic). The campaign is completely free, and a blast to play. It's challenging, but not overly so. You'll earn gold and cards along the way which have value. A truly dedicated player could theoretically play enough PVE content to be effective in PVP, but prepare for a long road.\n\nAt this point, the in game ads are nearly non exsistant, there's no energy system, the classes and races are NOT restricted to paying customers. There is a currency you can buy (platinum) and a currency you earn playing the game (gold). It is not impossibly hard to trade gold, or cards you've acquired for free for platinum. I don't think it's fair to reasonably expect anything more from a free to play game. It's a shame there needs to be a premium currency at all, but it's understandably necessary.\n\nI really love the art in this game, and the races they feel somewhat unique/creative. The sound is nice and peaceful, the backgrounds and cards are varied enough to not get bored too easily. The only thing lacking is the animation, it is a card game, so what do you expect? I can't fault the animation, it does what it needs to. It's just the art on the cards is so neat, you want to experience more of the world and characters than just the still images.\n\nThe biggest flaw is the PVP, which you have a significant advantage if you have good cards. Not all cards are created equal. Getting a deck to a competitive state will take an investment, be it monetary or time. But you can find many hours of enjoyment foregoing PVP entirely.","May 24","true","110.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

I did not know that. Please see the comment section for parts II - VI)\n\n************************\nPART I\n************************\n\nHi, friend. Welcome. You are clearly interested in TCGs, or card-based games in general, so let me tell you a bit about HEX.\n\nFirst of all, this game has only been on Steam for a few days, but I have been playing since 2013, when the game was in the Alpha stage, so my hours played are closer to 500–1000. And that is a conservative estimate. So I believe I am qualified to tell you a bit about this game.\n\nNow, I am going to do this a bit differently. I will not try to cater to all players in general. I will speak directly to the players who are like me, because I would want to know about this game as soon as possible, and I will emphasize the points that made me fall in love with the game. Subsequently, this review will be long, because I would not mind reading a long well-written review myself, and I would want to know about all these features I will soon write about. Additional caveat: if you are not willing to truly immerse yourself in the game and properly learn all its myriad features and possibilities, this game might not be for you. This is not a very casual game. This is for true gamers who love complex mechanics and enjoy the incredible freedom HEX provides for the innovative player. Still here? Great! Let us jump right in.\n\nHave you always been looking for that one card-based game that would finally have a good single-player campaign, where you can collect cards simply by playing? And better yet, the cards you can collect are not limited in any way, so you can actually collect every single card in the game. Are you tired of all these “campaigns” in card games, where the solo content is simply a series of text boxes? Are you fed up that you can only complete them once, and then you are pretty much forced to play PvP if you want any further rewards? Why do card games never really build a world where you can adventure, like in an RPG? You might still remember Shandalar (nod to older gamers), where you could actually walk around on the world map, do quests and buy cards from taverns. Why is that not ever attempted anymore?  Well, your search is finally over. Enter HEX, the most ambitious card-based game that has ever existed.\n\nFirst of all, I would strongly recommend you watch the video on the Store page, where you can see this strange bearded guy with glasses. That strange bearded guy is one of the biggest reasons you should invest your time in this game. Let him tell you about it himself. I will come back to this point a little later. Let us explore the game first.\n\nHEX has two distinct sides. PvE and PvP. I will talk a bit about the PvP in the end, but quite frankly, that is an experience many other games provide as well. There are plenty of reviews out there that concentrate on the competitive side of HEX. I am not a competitive person, so I will mostly talk about how you can enjoy HEX without PvP. That is what drew me to the game, and if you are like me, that is the only thing you want to hear about.\n\nHEX has well over a thousand cards (I do not know the exact number, but it might be thousands at this point). There is a robust Card Manager that lets you combine them however you wish to make decks, and let me tell you, you can make some pretty fun decks. I have a deck that copies and replicates troops named Time Bug that aims to give myself infinite turns with the card’s ability. I have an Insect deck that only has disgusting crawlies. I have a life gain deck that aims to win via getting as much health as possible. I have a spider deck that will bury my opponent in eggs that actually go into your opponent’s deck (not possible in any non-digital TCG). I have a burrowing deck, where all the troops go underground and dig themselves up at the exact right moment to kill my opponent (again, only possible in a digital environment). All the decks play completely differently, and all are incredibly fun. I am constantly coming up with new deck ideas. If you enjoy deck-building, HEX is heaven. There is no limit to the number of decks you can create, and I currently have approximately 112 decks. All completely different. Are you starting to see the scope of this thing?\n\nThere is an entire Campaign where you walk on the world map. You can choose your path and do quests and side quests and get to know the world and lore. You can delve into a dungeon, which are longer, story-driven locations with better loot. You actually create a character and choose a race and class, and every class has their own talent tree, like in a real RPG. These talents in turn change the way you play the encounters or how you build your deck. There are not many classes to choose from yet, but every PvE patch will add more content. That is what makes it so exciting. This journey will never end, as there will constantly be more places and characters to explore. Just like in an MMORPG. Speaking of MMOs, there will eventually be co-operative raids, where you will take on huge bosses with two of your friends in a 3-against-1 scenario. These will naturally drop the most epic loot. There will be guilds as well, with guild banks, where you can presumably loan some cards from other members of your guild for that one particularly nasty encounter.\n\nBut wait, there is more. You can also collect equipment for you cards. Think about that for a second. You can equip your hero like in an RPG. Equipment can drastically change what a card does, which in turn changes how you play with the deck. Guess what, your possibilities just doubled. There are hundreds of pieces of equipment in the game, and even I have not come close to testing them all yet. In fact, every single card will eventually have 1–2 equipment. That is a mind-boggling amount of customizability. Some of them do really wacky things. Some of them are a great help against a particular boss for example. I have won encounters simply by changing some of the equipment in my current deck. You can find equipment during your adventures as loot, or you can get them from chests after opening packs. Wait, what?\n\nYes. Every time you open a pack, you will get a treasure chest as an additional reward. Just for opening a pack. These are of random rarity, and can range from common to legendary. The chests can contain equipment or cards, including rarer alternative art cards, which you can either keep or sell to buy something else you want. You might not want to open a chest immediately though. You see, there is one more additional level of rewards added to the pack opening experience. You can spin your chests with in-game earnable currency before opening them. Spinning yields some of the best rewards in the entire game. Or you can just save your gold and open the chest right away. The choice is yours.\n\nThen there are Primal packs and chests. Every time you purchase a pack from the in-game store, there is a possibility that it will generate a Primal Pack. These are insane packs that only contain rares and legendaries. Oh, by the way, did I mention that a HEX pack has 17 cards, so you get more cards per pack than in any other card game I know of. Primal Chests can only be obtained by spinning a chest and getting an upgrade. These chests contain some of the most sought-after rewards in the game, like extremely rare sleeves for your decks.","April 23","true","83.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","5"

Still a young game compared to MTG but already had a $100K tournament and more on the way.  The community also does tournaments , where you can win large in game currency prizes and booster packs.\n-Auction house and trading.  Many tcgs don't have this so you constantly keep having to buy hoping you will get lucky.\n-True PVE experience with things like champions that you level and equipment\n-Really nice community that give away lots of stuff to new players and are very helpful-In game support in chat to answer questions contiuously.  They are called nobles and have a different call text\n-Cheap boosters which have lots of value.  So besdes your cards you get a chest which could be common, uncommon, rare or legendary.  They contain stuff which you can use or sell on the ah.  You can also spin them using gold which is the free in game currency from PVE or the Frost Arena to get even more prizes.  These in turn you can use or sell.  There is a spin prize that sells for $20 worth of plat for example should you get lucky, (Slaughtergears cards rare and legendary versions from rolling on set 3 chests).\n-THERE IS SO MUCH MORE EXCITING STUFF TO COME.  The game is already awesome but it has much more to come such as more PvE, new sets, raids, guilds, ladders, new classes, new races and much more\n\nCons:\n\n-There has been server issues since the release due to the massive influx of players but then isn't that the case when any new game releases new content.\n-PvE is so much fun you will want more.\n-They would ike to have more of their features released but They claim that due to now having the first batch of PvE out everything should speed up.  if that is the case things will be awesome.\n\nHonestly if you love TCG's what are you waiting for, download and try it for yourself and I hope to see you in game :)!","April 24","true","69.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

A lot like MTG and in my opinion much better than Hearthstone. It is pay to win for constructed in the sense that you have no chance without a top teir deck, but thats like every TCG. PvE is fun as well. HOWEVER if you have a Mac, either don't get this game OR get this game and emplore the devs to fix the issues with Mac. The game will go to an infinite loading screen like every 10 min without any kind of error message.

There are only mediocre or bad MTG games (compared to the card game itself) but this has so far lived up to a fair expectation.  The best part is, with how they did it, it will be pretty easy for them to keep adding cards and keep the game running for a long time.   Unfortunately, I do feel paying as much as they are asking for the cards is a bit pricey.  Sure, you can earn gold and packs and get cards through grinding, but they are borderline greedy with their pricing.\n\nOverall, I give the game a 7/10 for the PVE side for the following reasons:\n-Decent art\n-great copy of Magic the Gathering, making it VERY easy to learn\n-Plenty to do right from the start.\n-Nice little leveling system for those of us that have to progress in games.\n-plenty of cards so you will see a lot of different combos when playing\n\nThe Bad\n-Expensive product if you choose to pay.\n-A 'VIP system' which gives you minor rewards and also gives you discounts on other things, which encourages you to buy even more than you need to\n-Poor preperation for steam.  Servers went down today, so they will get some negative reviews for that.\n-Campaign could still use some touch ups, nothing big, just a bunch of little things.\n\nThe game is free, and I highly suggest trying it if you miss playing Magic the Gathering since the game is free.","April 21","true","465.8"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

I have been a MtG player RL and online for a long time and if this continues to be that much fun, I might switch completely.\n\nWhy you might ask?\n\nPositive aspects:\n+ Crapload of cards\n+ Cards are funny, nice artwork and really have cool mechanics that only an online TCG has\n+ Not that expensive, because there are alot of formats tournaments etc. that make getting cards cheap and PVE is even completely free\n+ PVE: this is sooo cool, if they keep up to their promise this might in the future be the main reason to play it. At the moment not THAT mich content, but enough for a weekend or two and quite sweet\n+ The auction house is really cool for trading and the prices are ok - I wonder why MtGO hasn't been able to as long as I played there. I guess WotC just don't give a damn\n+ Really nice, cool and dedicated community\n+ They have a great support\n\nNegative Aspects (so far):\n- Sometimes a bit laggy AH and Mail System (between 5-8 seconds delay), but I read they will soon fix this in a hotfix\n- If you are only into PVE and want to experience story there is not that much out there so far, although it has a high replayability, cause of the rewards, so if you are a collector/farmer you will love it\n\nAll in all really cool atm and if only half of my expectations are met for the future, this game will dominate.\nAnd if you want to play competitive againt other player (the professional level in the tournaments is mediocre to high) you will have to invest about a 100$ or grind as hell in PVE for a month and sell your stuff on the AH. Keep in mind, TCGs on tournament level are never free or super cheap, but here you don't have to drive anywhere and COULD even grind those cards completely for free.

I am a father and now play games casually, unlike when I was in college and could play days on end. This game really makes me wish I was back in those days! This game spoke to me because of the ability to have a variety of options to play this game. I have always enjoyed collectable card games but never had anyone to really play with, so they always fell to the wayside (Magic, Star Wars, Pokemon, Warcraft). When Magic went online, I just couldn't get back into the game like I had once before, feeling it would just take too much time to learn the online mechanics. Hex felt streamlined and I was able to get right into the game without even going through the tutorial.\nI liked that it also added in a PvE element into the game. I have always enjoyed PvE in games more than PvP, since I can play at my own pace that way, but I have actually enjoyed the PvP in Hex just as much, and sometimes more, than the PvE. I like the challenge is provides when facing an opponenet, the complexity of the interactions between the cards and the dynamic gameplay that it presents. In PvE and PvP, there are always differnt ways of approaching your opponent and Hex sets it up for you to do so.\nThere is always an occasional frustration when things just don't go your way, but while I may not like it at the time, I always reflect that it is not always the way it goes, making it realistic in my mind. Makes me enjoy the times I do best an opponent and be able to share a good win with a community member.\nThe community itself is amazing as well and helps make the game even more enjoyable. You have a lot of helpful players out there who offer advice and tips for playing. I relearned my TCG mechanics and lingo from streamers and learned how passionate people were about the game, like myself.\nI see myself playing this game for years to come and looking forward to all the incoming content for the game. If you like to play any games with cards, you will surely enjoy this one.","May 15","true","0.1"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleshbits/recommended/410380/","fleshbits","Fleshbits","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleshbits/","42 products in account","The game itself is decent enough for a TCG. Given that there are bucket loads of games out there in the genre, having good mechanics and well thought out cards is mandatory. The game gives you that. It also gives you a campaign that is fun and addictive until you beat it a few times.\n\nYou've actually got to adjust your deck for the campaign to beat certain challenges. I dig that. Makes you think beyond using the same old deck every time.\n\nYou also get to wear equipment to boost certain cards, and you level up a character to give you certain perks, much like hero powers in other popular card games.\n\nNote that you only level up your character to level 9 in the campaign. There is no character devleopment outside of the campaign and you don't use campaign characters vs other players. The campaign is not finished and there is only 1 "act" to go through. Also, only half the classes are implemented at the time of this writing.\n\nThat's all great....for a week or so. Then the bad starts.\n\nYou will not have enough cards from the campaign or currency, which is gold collected as you play the ai, to build a decent deck. Despite what other player's in thier community want you to believe, going into this game FTP is going to cost you weeks of time before you even get enough to get your first booster, much less play a competive deck against a human being.\n\nPeople will argue this to their death and point you at various guides...all of which I did for 75+ hours. I still have yet to have enough gold to get my first booster pack. They expect you to buy cards with the gold you earn in the campaign to progress through the latter parts of the campaign. Many of the cards you will be after cost 20 to 30k gold, while you are earning around 2k per evening. They then want you to sell cards you got in the campaign, which do not sell, because everyone wants to sell the cards from the campaign. They then want you to buy packs from other players. which currently cost around 19k gold, draft, win, open reward packs, repeat. Not feasible. Not at all.\n\nThe biggest downer is the market model. You cannot spend gold directly to get _anything_ from the game. They sell everything for platinum, which is real money currency. The one and only thing gold is used for is to roll bonsues on booster packs for a chance to win extra cards....those booster packs being bought by someone else or won in tournaments of course. There is nothing in the game you can get from playing that _someone_ didn't had to pay for.\n\nYes, you can trade on their auction house, but as a new player, expect that 98% of the cards you get in the campaign do not sell, or sell so low that it isn't even worth clicking your mouse. Why would they? Everyone is playing the campaign and already has those cards.\n\nWhich brings me to the other downer. The cards you win in the campaign are not randomly drawn from all cards in the game. There is a specific set of cards in the adventure packs that are drawn from. You get the same rares based on your class/race for challenges. So expect the market to be flooded with those particular cards. They only have a bit of value if they take 10+ hours to get...and I mean little value.\n\nThis model of not having the game directly give players any product for the currency earned with their playtime will leave you having to replay the campaign several times and that gets damn boring. Then you might, and I say might, just come up with something that you can progress to the arena with. YOu then have to play that Arena over and over for countless hours with a deck you are bored of playing to acquire enough gold to buy packs from other players to draft with. Good luck following the guides! They all contain cards that cost at least 30k gold that you will have to buy via auction house from other players.\n\nThe game is clearly built to hook you, bait you, then frustrate and bore you until you fork over your cash.\n\nI wouldn't have a problem with forking over $50-$100 for a few months of fun, but it's going to cost _alot_ more than that to get anywhere. They want MTG money. Not having a means to spend gold directly to buy boosters makes that obivous.\n\nDon't listen to thier community. They get pissy when you argue it's taking too long to get anywhere without spending money. I spent 75+ hours on this game and have been successful in many online and paper TCGs. I am not about to go and spend thousands on another one. Never again after Magic.\n\nIt is not 1990 and most of us should know better than to get involved in the old TCG model of spending hundreds on cards just to continue playing.\n\nWe have viable alternatives now. Living card games for paper and many many TCGs out there that reward you cards for play, with minimal investment for a tournament every now and again.\n\nIt's too bad, because I like the campaign and the AI challanges so far.\n\n---------------\nEvidently, they don't like my review:\n\nBan notification from a HEX: Shards of Fate developer	— 8 hours ago\nYou have been banned from HEX: Shards of Fate Discussions\nYou have been banned from HEX: Shards of Fate Discussions by a HEX: Shards of Fate developer for your post in "Hex review":\nComparing Hex to Magic Duels is like comparing a dog terd to a human terd and Hearthstone is for kids who can't handle interaction on the opponent's turn without A.D.D medication.\n\nHave you guys seriously not played any of the other 50+ card games available in 2016?\n\nBan Reason:\nWhilst we want to be lenient regarding posts and wish to allow all forms of discussion, positive and negative to take part on these forums, several lines have been crossed which we cannot allow.","April 28","false","414.7"," 45 of 83 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","45","83","4","7"

While Hex has had problems sticking to a release schedule for new sets and PvE content, it can still be a heck of a lot of fun. They don't do themselves any favors yet referring to this as a free-to-play title, since the most fun can be had playing the quite affordable PvP tournaments. Draft tournaments are my favorite, and they're quite competitively priced, compared to other offerings on the market. When it came out, Hex was fairly compared quite often to Magic: The Gathering, but there are a fair number of differences that become apparent the more you play, and with the release of each passing set, it continues to mature into its own distinctive entity. At this point, I say it's no more similar to MtG than, say, Call of Duty is to Doom.","June 5","true","10.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It is a deeper strategy game then Hearthstone. Hex provides a good PVE and PVP experience with mmo style adventure and tournament support.\n\nI have played since Alpha for 100's of hours playing both PVE and PVP.  Players start with 200 cards so you have a lot of options to start playing before having to spend money. As well as earning gold to buy cards on the Auction house. I saw some poor reviews that lambasted HEX as pay to win. I wanted to make sure people understood you get a bunch to start with and play with PVE before you really need to invest any $. Also the claim of PVE harder to force to buy cards shows that people are not using deck builder to update their decks, remember PVE like in hearthstone is more of a puzzle. So you build a deck to solve the puzzle and with the large amount of cards to start you have a lot of choices.\n\nThey are still fine tuning the game and releasing their PVE side of the game but the current zone they have released is a taste of building your RPG character and advenuring in their world. character progression as well as gear that boosts specific cards allow players to shift their play style based on their decks and equipment. They also have a taste of their dungeon mechanics that like any MMO will be the key to earning new cards and gear. Their Raid model has not been released yet. Players start with 200 cards so you have a lot of options to start playing before having to spend money. As well as earning gold to buy cards on the Auction house.\n\nPVP as with any MTG store tournament allows players to do anything they could think, as well as thank god supporting draft tourneys.\n\nTheir developers are active in listening to the community and have ran their first 100k tourney. On top of that i have yet to not see active team members online going by the NOBLE tags for the game.\n\nOverall for a deeper game then HS I am loving my time with HEX and can't wait for their impromvements.","April 19","true","11.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

This game offers that and so much more.\nThe community (at the time of this writing) is very friendly, helpful when questioned and overall a good bunch of people.\n\nthe game itself though is where things shine.\n\nwith the release of the PvE Adventure Zone 1, new ways of obtaining Gold and Cards are available. If you play through as one race and class and get to a point where you are a bit stuck, create a new champion and go through a few of them. Just by playing the storyline you are granted packs which contain very useful items. If they aren't useful to you, the Auction House or the Trade Channel can help you find a way to trade/sell it off and get something which pertains to your deck in question.\n\nOnce you get some strength, you can then take on the Arena. A gauntlet match of 20 boss fights, lose 3 times, and you have to start over, but every 5 fights you qualify for prizing.\n\nThere are three big reasons to do these events. Cards, Equipment, Gold. Not to mention the fact you get to learn a bit more of the game as you go. Got a dungeon your deck doesn't work for yet? fine tune it with different cards. You may have to change things up to win these encounters.\n\nPlenty of replayability, specially with the different race/class types.\n\nThe PvP events are a lot of fun to do as well. If you do want to Draft, start off with the 'Swiss' version, this lets you play all the rounds and you can learn a bit more of the cards. Once you are confident, go on to the Competive modes which are single elimination with a bigger payout.\n\nAll in all, this game has been a blast to play since the Alpha, I just wish i could play more.","April 19","true","183.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

With what is available right now, it's a completely playable TCG; it's got drafts, sealed, constructed; it has a solid PVE campaign, fully functional auction house, and MMORPG elements (socketable cards, equipment, levels, talents).\n\nHEX is a game that is a dream come true for many of us; a competitive, high quality, TCG where you cards actually have value. I played Magic as a teenager and have been looking for something to bring those good times back, without having to go to a card shop every week. HEX is the answer that many of us have been looking for.\n\nIf you just want to play for free, and you aren't willing to grind, go play something else.

Or you can play against other players in various formats that accommodate your play style and time available. Even beginners can be competitive from day one if they play the draft or sealed card formats, where everyone builds their decks with the card packs that are opened before the match.\n\nOffers A Challenge\nThe PVE is challenging, in a good way. You have to use your wits and improve your deck as you go in order to get through the campaign. The gold you earn can be used in the Auction House to buy more cards. And you get free cards and packs as you progress through the campaign as well.\n\nGreat Community\nReally friendly and helpful community. One of the best I have ever seen.\n\nAwesome Streamers\nThere is a really good group of streamers on Twitch that stream HEX all the time.

My wife often accuses me of having an affair with the PC and it's gotten to a stage where she frequently uses it as a tool in domestic negotiations. My two year old son has also figured the best way to get daddy's attention is by pulling the plug.\n\nI am absolutely in love and Hex has become my go-to leisure activity. The easisest way to describe it is, the more time I give it, the more rewarding it becomes. There's so much of variety and replayability, it absolutely STOMPS any other game out there in terms of value. It really is a "lifestyle" game.\n\nYou have completely F2P PvE content, interacting with some pretty advanced TCG AI that makes battles really intersting. You even get a 'feel' for the type of AI personality you're playing against if you pay attention to the story and setting. Heaps of fun, especially when it goofs up spectacularly and you win what should have rightfully been a loss and wipe the sweat off your brow as you squeak through to the next challenge.\n\nEach encounter is thoughtfully designed, with gorgeous art and music supporting the story-telling. I'm still amazed at the little gems of lore or innuendo that I pick up on my third or fourth playthrough. The best part is, there are no artificial paywalls that limit how much you can play each day or that shepherd you to a point where you just can't progress without paying. This gives you an amazing amount of free, high-quality content that is replayable with very different experiences driven by the faction and class choices you make when creating your character.\n\nAs you can probably tell, I'm a fan of the PvE. In fact, I backed the game during Kickstarter for the RPG/MMO elements. It's funny how things change. I probably only devote 20% of my time to PvE nowadays.\n\nIf you like a challenge, enjoy competition and don't have the reflexes or apm to cut it in any of the  clickity-clack e-sports out there, Hex is where you want to focus your time. It provides an engaging digital environment with two different competitive formats to sate your appetite. Constructed is where you pit wits against an opponent with pre-made decks and your skill in piloting the deck determines if you win or lose. Draft is where you build decks on the fly with a limited number of random cards and then proceed to bash face with synergistic card-combos. The latter has proven to be my favored format.\n\nI probably never considered myself a fan of art before Hex. Over the past three years, I have developed a taste for it and now think of myself as a fledgling collector. Some of the card art is phenomenal and I find myself browsing through my collection occasionally, just admiring what's on display. Sometimes, I perv through the collections of those who have Extended the art on their cards because I'm too much of a cheap-skate to do so.\n\nLike gambling? Then look no further than the Wheels of Fate! Woo Kismet and spin the free chests that you get when you buy a pack. You could hit a high-value chase card worth $25 and sell it on the Auction House for a tidy profit that can fuel your draft dreams for a few sessions.\n\nAre you a fan of value? Hex is unique because it is a true digital trading card game where you can actually make money by selling your in-game stuff via the player-run economy. Hex, the Auction House version, is the only version that's played by some of the keener market hounds\n\nI'm going to call out the last drawcard (hah!) Hex has and finish this up. The community of players is the cornerstone of this game's success. We've all grown with the game over the past three years and have created an environment that is safe, fun and welcoming to everyone. It's even more remarkable considering that it's all been mostly self-regulated.\n\nAlways remember that the devs (HxE) do look at the feedback we provide and though they may not have the time to actively engage in a discussion, I trust them to be doing the right thing. (If you guys are reading this, get your ♥♥♥♥ together and put that ladder system in asap! <3) I look forward to watching the game grow and be adopted by a whole bunch of new players who find themselves falling in love with it as well. Stick around for the long-term. You will be rewarded. Possibly with a hundred big ones, California, The Beach, Waves, Surfing, Sand and... the THING.\n\nHave fun playing Hex. Say hi to the community and make friends. If you need any specific commons or uncommons in game, drop me a line on twitter.com/chocmaw – happy to help :)","April 20","true","644.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Good for about 1 week to play, then you might as well look for something new. Long story short:\n\nPros:\n- Plot - IMHO races and their background are really interesting\n- Graphic - very good\n- Loooots of cards and possibilities to make combos of them\n- Campaign, very challenging\n- Good mechanic of game itself\n\nCons:\n- Taking cards from your deck - I know it should be random, but when 30/60 cards of your deck are lands ("shards") and you still lost becouse 8 times in a row you didn't draw a land... Well, it should be some kind of algoritm to avoid that.\n- paywall - if you don't want to be payer, you may as well say "bye bye" to any PVP in this game, becouse cards you get in PVE mode are 90% only for PVE (a little crown icon at left top corner of the card). And farming enough gold to buy 1 booster is about 4hours.\n- no real PVP - there are only tournaments, where you need to pay to enter. If you want to just play with random oponent, there are completly no reward for it - no ranking, no gold, no points.\n- Bugs - there are some still on Frost Ring Arena, mailing system often crush.\n- Optimalization - filtering your cards make my game freeze for a few seconds for each filter, so when I want to look at cards of only one colour, i must wait about 15 seconds to do so.\n- Too many cards - if you got more than 4 copies of some card (or more than 1 of equipment) you can't do anything with that. Of course, there is ingame trade system, but there are cards that all people there have in more than 4 copies so noone will buy it even for 1 gold. Game have no system of recycling useless cards.","May 6","true","110.3"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","11","19","0","1"

With that being said, however, my balance would shift to recommending this over not for the simple reason of it is fun, it is strategic, the would be cool in pvp elements of pve cards, and a seemingly refreshing take on a genre that is all of a sudden growing exponentially.\n\nNo, I'm not an original backer, no I haven't been playing for years or even months, honestly, i picked it up over a weekend and invested a massive amount of time into the game, I shouldn't need to list my creditials by citing all the TCG's online or not that i've played, because they count for nothing in giving an unbiased review of the "current" state of this game.\n\nA lot of positive reviews, start off by comparing it to the table top era of TCG's because that is nearly how it plays, and i cleary mean that it hasn't evolved to incorporate gameplay concepts to reduce player input or speed up actions for quality of life purposes; for example: Being able to quickly use a card ability or dealing with having multiple, it would be nice to set an automatically use on opponents end step, or just by clicking or right clicking on the action itself to perform.\n\nIn diving into why this game was once glorified and continues to be pushed by the core populous, is what this game could/would/will be if and when they deliver on their promises and incorporated those features that would have and would even today, put an incredible spin on the genre. At this point it is little more than your generic online TCG. Equipment is a nice addition, but is severly limited outside of PvE, the RPG element of leveling and having a talent tree, and introducing something that could be an amazing experience is again limited to PvE only, but that portion is further limited to campaign only. Sockets again interesting and allow for a modular effect and can be used in PvP, it offers senergistic possibilities with cards, you may want to continue being in your deck, however they are lackluster at first glace, for instance a 3 drop 2/2 has a socket and can gain flying... across all TCG's that is a very generic normal 3 drop, but as stated it is modular, so it can crossover into different deck possibilities, with the same card, for instance gaining the ability to attack on the first turn, attacking with the troop will give it +1/+0, damaging a player makes you draw a card, a few others i won't mention.\n\nI do love TCG's. I do enjoy the time that is spent, however if you have short attention span and want something quick and fast paced this isn't it, you sit down for a game of Hex be ready for 15+ mins or more depending on skill level of time per match.","June 6","true","34.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's not F2P unless you spend a lot of time grinding the PvE content and play the auction house, which loads painfully slowly and lacks a lot of functionality.\n\nGameplay is solid, but like I said it's basically MTG. The only real difference is the mana system. When you play a 'charge' (land), you get a threshold - and certain cards require a number of different colored thresholds but otherwise you can spend any type of 'mana'. The best way I can relate this difference to magic is with an example like this:\n1) You have 10 Islands and 2 Forests.\n2) You want to play two primeval titans (cost 4GG)\n3) In Magic, you wouldn't be able to do this because you only have enough green mana for one.\n4) In Hex, you can do this. As long as you have enough mana, you only need to have the two forests (threshold counters).","May 1","true","37.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

I spend most of my time playing PVE, having built my total investment of around $150 into 10-15 solid decks that I can rotate through, with new ones being created on a regular basis.  At less than 50 cents an hour, that's also probably near the top of my games in terms of value as well.\n\nMy PVP experience has been focus on Sealed Gauntlet, which allows me to play a match here or there rather than dedicate the hours needed for a traditional tournament.  It also means that I'm on even ground with everyone else, despite not having many of the most expensive cards.\n\nThe most important advice I would give about the game is if you run into difficulty in the campaign, first make sure that you can't just skip that encounter, as there are many optional challenges throughout.  Then, if you really are blocked, start a new character!  The best part about this game is the wide variety of viable decks, and playing as different characters will not only help you improve, but you'll earn cards that you can use on your first character to help them too!","April 20","true","150.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Yes the basic gameplay is very similar to MtG but that is what drew me to it. It does so many things right and is a much better digital environment to play in then MtGO ever was. If you enjoy trading card games and are looking for one you can play from the comfort of your own home whenever you have the time to play without having to look for a place to play or people to play with then Hex is for you.\n\nYes the PvE side of the game allows one to play and enjoy aspects of the game for free. Yes you can grind out gold (the PvE currency) to get PvP items from the AH. No, this is not a Pay to win game... it's a TCG. This is how trading card games work, cards have value because they are rare, and because people want them. If they were common and easy to get or useless and never played then they have no value. The value of a card in a trading card game is dependent on what people are willing to pay for it, this does not make a game pay to win it makes the game an investment. If you want to play a card game PvP but don't like that the rarer cards cost money (Which is how TCGs will always work) then this game is not for you, TCGs are not for you so why are you looking into a TCG?\n\nNo, Hearthstone is not a TCG, it's a CCG. In a game where you can not trade your cards your money and time disappear into a black hole of nothingness. Hex is a TCG, which means both your money and time is treated like an investment. As long as people want to buy whats in your collection then your collection will have a monetary value.

You'd be silly to not see the differences.\n\nHowever, where others see blatant ripoff, I see an homage from people who loved playing MTG growing up and wanted to create a purely digital version of it.\n\nThis game is great for people who are familiar with MTG as you'll pick up the core concept really quickly.

That being said, it's not complete, so I can't really make my final verdict as to whether its worth the time or not. The card game shows similar game style to MtG but I believe it can take it one step further. As of now the developers need to update the game with new things to increase the likeability of this game , as I'm on the edge of liking it.  I bought the starter bundle (I suggest to not buy the starter bundle and use this money towards platnium) and really want to show my full support for the full release, as this game can be something big. A couple suggestions to the developers. 1) Can you add a difficulty setting for story mode? I seem to be having issues with completion due to the fact I suck at video games. 2) Can you allow deeper customization to our characters in story mode (via colors/apparel) and 3) Can you allow us to buy packs with gold? The auction house is a blessing but if I wanted to resume the game as a f2p player I need the packs for the chests that come with them, since I cannot beat this level in the campaign.","April 28","true","18.7"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

It fills a nice niche that isn't really in the market atm. At least not with the same quality as Hex has.\n\nPros:\n1. Insanely fun and well designed sets. Limited and constructed are clearly well thought out, and every set brings interesting new mechanics.\n\n2. Unique mechanics only possible in the digital space. Hex sets itself apart by doing crazy things that are not possible in real-life TCGs. Modifying troops, filling an enemies deck with hundeds of spiders, and lots of other fun little things.\n\n3. Possible to play the whole game for free. It will take some work on the part of the player, especially a new one, but I was able to amass a pretty respectable collection in during my time as a f2p player. Constructed pvp is a bit harder to f2p, but then again, Constructed is the most expensive mode in all TCGs.\n\n4. Great Developers and great Community. The devs and players all seem to really care about this game, and they generally are very generous and respectful towards other players.\n\n5. Real value. Hex strives to marry the qualities of real life TCGs and videogames, and as a result, cards in Hex have real money value. (In particular, rares and legendaries, as commons and uncommons are in such high supply.) Cards can be invested in and sold for Platinum (premium currency) or Gold.  If you decide to invest some money in Hex and a few months later, you don't want to play anymore, you can still sell your cards to others through a third party, allowing you to at least get some of your money back (and if you are very lucky and get the timing right, more).\n\nCons:\n\n1. Starting out can be rough. Between a lack of experience and a small collection, playing the game as a f2p can appear quite daunting. This early phase will require some patience and research to get a good deck for farming the arena, but once it's done, you'll be able to play the game as a true f2p player, especially now that Evo gauntlet is out.\n\n2. Some bugs. They have been getting much better with these, but there are still a few noticable bugs in the game. Nothing extremely bad though.\n\n","May 5","true","131.4"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","12","22","0","0"

Get a hold of the basics, read guides online and proceed to deck building to run arenas for gold if that's what you're looking for.\n\nServers are a lot better after yesterdays update. Stutters during AH and deck page scrolling still needs a lot of improvements.\n\nOriginal Review (Thumbs Down)\n=======================\nPROS\n1) Friendly community\n2) Not as P2W as Hearthstone as you can farm gold to buy stuff so much faster. I absolutely love this.\n3) Players who prefer the PVE aspects of TCGs would find a lot of things to do here (+make your blood boil too, read cons).\n\nCONS\n1) Game is laggy as hell. Why the hell is there a delay and rubberbanding of cards when I'm playing VS AI????? Hearthstone could do it smoothly and I'm playing with over 300ping against other LIVE players.\n\n2) Campaign makes my blood boil. As a new player coming into TCG, my first choice would be to try the campaign out. So why exactly are the AI card draws fixed? The 2nd boss you'll face called Savage Lord plays a 6/4 + 5/3 card on turn 2 EVERY SINGLE TIME. The only way I managed to beat him was by pure RNG luck draw. This is a really great way to turn away new players like myself who are scared away by MTG and Hearthstone but want to try a new TCG. It would be so much better (and fair) if the AI's draw is random.\n\n3) Auction house constantly freezes and takes a long time to load.\n\nEvery CON that I've stated above can be fixed and I will change my review once I see it.

The game is good. Very good! It's campaign system ensures that you have ways to get cards and packs free and helps acquaint you with the world Hex is set in. I can compare this with Infinity Wars' campaign (also a free tcg in Steam go check it out.) and Hex has a more expansive campaign that let's you traverse the land, fight foes, conquer dungeons, complete quests and meet likeable NPCs and encounter moments that lets you feel immersed in the world.\n\nMoreso, the battle system is simplistic but familiar. It can be compared with Magic: the gathering, in fact, they play somewhat similarly but Hex has it's own unique charms. The battlefield has never been more scenic and sometimes the settings have special conditions that makes each fight more alive from taming monster cards to add to your collection to saving a transmogrified princess. Every aspect of the game makes it feel more like an RPG than any other TCG out there.\n\nWith all that i've said, you may be asking why am I not recommending this game to you? Pretty simple really. Despite all these moments and fun in game, one thing has really been a thorn on my side that really sours my experience and that is the connection stability in this game. The game at times can get REALLY slow making gameplay very cumbersome and really hampers the experience. I like this game so much that I will comeback from time to time trying to muscle my way through this tedious connection problem(and believe me if I didnt love this game, I would just scrap it like any other iTCG I tried), but more often than not I tend to get stuck at loadings, in between turns and phases, and even get disconnected which really bothers my experience. I'll be honest, i don't have the most stable internet and this might be a problem on my part. However despite my download speed reaching more than 0.5 MB/s with ping<50 I still experience these problems and judging from the forum posts on their main site this has been an ongoing issue ever since the Alpha stage. If you can brave this limitations and have, like, the fastest internet out there(or at least more stable than mine) I recommend you check it out and see if yours is stable, otherwise don't bother as you'll just be grinding your teeth trying to get to past the login screen.\n\nEdit: I've decided to recommend this game. My net troubles might just be mine alone. This is a really good card game and once more PvE and campaign content releases, there will be more to do. Everything in game can be obtainable for free and if you think getting premium currency is difficult, it's as simple as offering to trade in your hard earned gold for some platinum. Many folks would rather trade in their plats for gold currency.","May 8","true","209.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And besides the mana system and WotC cash grab MtG is pretty much the best. Mana system sucks in Hex as well, but hey, boosters are *way* cheaper! Art is pretty great as well, really the only downside is Hex obviously doesn't have nearly as many different cards as MtG does.\n\nFor me the main draw of this game were the PvE features, ie campaign and arena. PvP is nice, but constructed in ccgs and tcgs always tends to be a matter of who has the most expensive/powerful cards, while sealed/draft has a price tag on each session.\n\nSo, the campaign is.. suprisingly fun. There's only Adventure Zone 1 right now, which is reasonably long with lots of different fights. The AI is pretty awful but the opponents have rather big advantages on their side, so for the most parts fights are interesting. At least if you play with the provided deck and only use PvE rewards to improve that deck, once you start using any significant amount of PvP cards it gets way easier.\n\nOh yeah, PvE cards. Those are the cards you get as rewards from the campaign quests, adventure packs and such. They're my one huge issue with the campaign, as they tend to be either very vanilla, or silly rng. Going only with the reward cards it's pretty hard to keep any interesting theme in the starter decks. Like the vennen deck, which has a pretty strong spider theme: it's fun, but if you want to stick to the theme it's going to be pretty weak and inconsistent. Unless you get some PvP cards.\n\nLuckily, with some farm/grind it's entirely possible to buy PvP cards with gold you earn during the campaign. Personally I found it pretty distracting having to play auction house while I just wanted to actually play the game, though.\n\nI've been playing mostly f2p so far (bought some plat for a bunch of PvP commons/uncommons mostly), so I haven't had a chance to try drafting. The grind to get enough gold to start drafting is pretty big, but seems doable, and it's possible to go infinite from there if you're good. I'm not, sadly :p","April 22","true","100.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","8"

I backed the kickstarter and pretty much tried it in closed Alpha and wasnt impressed back then. It had alot of bugs and gameplay was slow. I pretty much forgot this game for years (quite literraly). When it released i relunctantly booted it up not expecting much and wow i was impressed with all the combinations and so much more content. Also the fact you can pve and get gear and level up your champion you create with different abiolties and skills.. its like a kinda light RPg which is nice and make sit personal to play and to accomdate your style. Its fun to get gear on your favorite troop and actually make it viable in the campiagn. Also there are right now 45 Champions to chose from for PvP and constructing your deck. All with different health and abilties, and its quite orginal and unique instead of the usual each person has X amount of health starting. The differnt clases are differnt too, Rogue,Warrior,Mage, Cleric, Warlock, and Ranger. All in all very impressed and have alot of faith and having lots of fun and im BARELY scratching the surface. As a long time MTG player, this defintly has alot of take from that but not in a bad way. Actually more like an "Upgraded successor" to MTG with its OWN unique elements and an actual online interface program that WORKS and is fun,fast. I found no bugs so far and i have been TRYING to do everything possible to look for some playing with options and doing silly things. I did get disconnected twice in 2 differnet matches, BUT i simply rebooted the game and within about 20 seconds i was back and reconnected to the same game . ITs free to play, but give syou ALOT of cards and the fact you can do about 10-15 hours of Campaign you get even more gold and items/cards is great. There also will be Co-op campaigns in the near future which will awesome to work and "raid" bosses or go on adventures/campaigns together with friends. I honestly have been so jaded with so many Free to play CCG games the last few years i ASSUMED this was going to fall to the wayside and be at worst "Bad" and at best "Mediocre".

The devs seem genuinely committed to producing a quality game and working with the players to make the best possible experience (something we don't get enough of on steam). If you have played a mtg style card game the mechanics should be familiar and easy to pick up but Hex is its own game in its own universe (and there is a single player campaign mode set in that universe, WINNING) and has enough of its own flavor to make it stand apart.

It has a PvE campaign where you take a RPG lite character through various encounters, levelling up and earning new cards on the way.\n\nA "arena" where you earn a ton of gold for fighting puzzle style bosses with unique abilities and earn a load of gold\n\nThen finally, PvP! Automatic drafts of all types to keep you interested.

All the complexity of the fully fleshed out deeply strategic TCG, but easy to pick and and play with a computerized interface. It being an online TCG makes finding a match effortless.  They are doing some incredibly creative stuff with the game mechanics that you'd never be able to do in a physical card game.\n\nIt is free to play, but not really.  Anyone that has played a competitive card game knows that its technically possible to play for free, but its contrary to the entire card collecting/trading concept.  If you want to fully enjoy this game, don't consider it a free to play game.

Don't expect this game to be a F2P MTG, though.  If you want to play competitively, or accumulate valuable rare cards, you will have to spend money (or a lot of time).  But what you are buying can be resold if you quit, much like MTGO (and unlike Hearthstone).  I have friends who have decided they didn't have time to play anymore, and they were able to sell their collection for what they paid for it, though I would say that you usually should expect to take somewhat of a loss in that scenario unless you won a lot of cards through tournaments.\n\nI don't want to say a bunch of things that have already been said, but I will say that some of the negative reviews of this game are just simply false.  You absolutely can beat the campaign (not the challenge missions necessarily) without spending money (or grinding for 100 hrs).  I think people have even done without engaging with the player-run economy (i.e. Auction House), but its far easier if you realize that you can buy some synergistic cards for small amounts of gold (that you get from playing PVE).  Hopefully they will improve the AH and make it more obvious to new players.\n\nThere are also some very good negative reviews that point out legitimate flaws with the game, or ways that the game does not meet that player's expectations.  Its certainly not going to be for everyone.  I would encourage people to look at it as a much improved MTGO that also has a PVE component.  Hex is currently not a great F2P game, but its a lot of fun if you are willing to drop $20 to make a decent PVE deck, and even more fun if you are interested in spending some money to play drafts and sealed tournaments.  The F2P components are going to get better with time, as they release more content and tune things up, but for now, solely as a F2P game, I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nPersonally, I spend hundreds on MTG back in the day, so getting to play an even better game for far less money is fine by me.  I cashed out my MTG collection and spent 20% of that money on Hex for 100s of hrs of fun (I play this game mostly without using the Steam client, so my actual hours are in the 100-1000 range).  I got this game for PVE, but found I really love playing Limited formats (Draft, Sealed, Gauntlet, etc). The PVE stuff has been horribly delayed, and what is in there now is just the beginning, but I think it has a lot of promise.\n\ntl;dr Try it, keep an open mind, don't focus on being F2P (and use the AH if you do), engage with the community and ask questions, people are generally super nice and helpful","May 12","true","0.6"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","1"

The creators of this game deceived people who financially backed them. According to comments made by the developers during the game's creation:\n\nHex was promised to feature feasible methods of attaining cards through pve. At the moment, packs and cards through the campaign are few, far between, and (seemingly) highly limited.\n\nHex was promised to feature group pve--which we were told was "almost finished" a year ago. This was put on the back burner and the game launched without group pve.\n\nGiven that the game's philosophy has changed in favour of blatant money-grabs (despite the game's primary investors being its playership, no less) and given that this type of developer deception seems to be happening more and more lately, I'd feel morally obligated to give a negative review even if I felt this product were otherwise satifactory.\n\nThe single-player campaign (your only option for attaining cards without buying one of the lackluster starter decks or selling your organs, one by one, to roll the dice on randomized microtransactions) suffers from pacing problems. It's writing is nice enough, but there are so many encounters to get through any story arc. Each deck you fight is essentially the same as the last, with the only change being in your opponent's charge-based abilities. That wouldn't be so bad except 4/5 times an encounter's rewards are: 1/8 of a level and a handful of coins that have almost no value. Calling the Hex's grind tedious would be an understatement.\n\nHex's other appeal is as a clone of old school MTG and, I've gotta say, it succeeds on this front. The interface is very impressive and very clean, and I *would* praise it for offering a way to play MTG online with friends. The only problem is that anyone who's played MTG *knows* how expensive the habit can be. Buying packs is like the original microtransaction--but at least then you have a physical copy.\n\nTo bring that model online--to require your players to spend money for a *chance* to get 1 of the 4 copies of a card they need--is deplorable. It's one thing to steal a game's style to make it more accessible for people. You're still a thief but you're kind of a hero too, like Robin Hood. When you do it just to get a cut of the money, you're a thief and a scam artist.","May 13","false","124.8"," 30 of 59 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","30","59","0","6"

(guild, ladder, raid dungeon, mercenary for pve etc.)\n\nAnother lie aswell i have to tell you, this game is supposed to give the card you get some "real values" mean like in every tcg, you could sell and buy the card, then cash out vs real money.\n\nthat is only half true, because sure you can sell and buy your card, but once you try to "cash out" from the game, since there is more seller than buyer, u'll barely get 30/40 % of the money you'd need to spend to get the currency in game to buy them.\n\nSo dont think this game as a good way to invest, it isnt.\n\n\nSo basically i'll resume this like that\n\ngood points\nIts a better digital MTG game\nIt has every pvp mode we could ask for (draft sealead or constructed)\nart is kinda nice, community not too much toxic\n\nbad points,\nScaming move from GameForge (edit : they changed the price to match the same on both platform, but wont remove the fact they tried to scam and had to change because of player voicing against it)\nISNT FREE TO PLAY IF YOU WANT TO PVP\nNo ladder or no mean to go casual\nReally slow development, bug take time to get fixed, cant respect their release schedule\nIngame community are kinda fanboys that may tend to be offensive toward anyone who disagree with this game\n\nNow you got my review, giving this review kinda hurt me because i believed in this game, but it sadly took the wrong road, and probably will get beaten by other card game that'll get published in the future, that's why even though im hurting myself writing this (the less the game does well, the more my ingame collection lose value), i feel like i need to warn you before you download it so you are well aware of what you are stepping on.\n\nHave a nice day, and may the fanboy try to not downvote it too much :)\n\nedit : ingame currency are now the same price either you buy them from steam or from gameforge website, all the other points still valid though.","April 21","false","127.1"," 81 of 163 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","81","163","0","13"

Yes.\n\nIt's not polished, and it is suffering lag (for some screens, such as auction house and mail) due to the influx of the Steam release + new content pack.\nUpdate 06/May/2016: New server upgrade has now fixed the AH/mail lag\n\nThere are even some instances where your mid game and the server kicks out, on the plus side through, everything is hosted server side, so you can reconnected to the game where you left off.\n\nAnother thing to note, that that not even all the items listed on the original kickstarter are complete.\nBut, is it fun? Yes!\n\nIt's very much like Magic the Gathering, except designed with the digital platform as a goal, not just in mind, but the goal. I would in fact describe this as Magic the Gathering evolved. I'm not surprised there was a, now settled, legal dispute over intellectual property. If you are familiar with the gameplay mechanics of Magic the Gathering, then you can learn the basic of this game in mere minutes.\n\nThe F2P section is quite a few hours of content. Well worth the price tag of free.\nI'm 40hrs in and still enjoying the first act of the campaign. (I'm playing two playthroughs of the campaign from two opposing sides concurrently).\n\nGive it a try, why not? It's free to try.\n\nPvP/P2P; review yet to be amended to this at a later date.

Only one minimal difference to Magic the Gathering. This should be illegal.\n\n[2016-04-24 Edit]\nWhat if Magic the Gathering was designed as a digital game instead of a physical one. HEX is that game. The core gameplay is straight up MtG and while the added features are neat, they aren't anything amazing or innovative - but they don't have to be. They don't have to be because there isn't anything like HEX on the market. This game is what WotC should've done with Magic, and since they haven't yet this game makes a lot of sense.\n\nJust know that if you removed everything Magic from HEX you would be left with a visual novel, an inventory system, some mediocre artwork and a "house rule".\n\nNote: I still wish they started the game differently, with the creation of the character, equipping some cards and gear or something.","April 19","true","13.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","17"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shroud3d/recommended/410380/","Shroud3d","Shroud3d","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shroud3d/","184 products in account","So I've been playing this for a while before its Steam release. I've invested a little over 100$ in Constructed decks.\n\nThis game is not that hard for people who played card games before. It has very good gameplay and offers a lot of replay value, being similar to MTG in almost every aspect. It has some digital-only card game mechanics that are pretty cool (cards that change other cards or put cards somewhere in the deck, for instance). It's not very hard to learn and you can zoom in on the cards to double-check what they do if you forgot. So that's nice.\n\nThe game is not pay2win, it's pay2compete just like other competitive card games. Constructed decks cost a little bit of money but not all that much. Most are between 50 and 100 dollars and you can technically go infinite by grinding. You can also sell your won cards in draft in the auction house to facilitate this.\n\nThe playerbase is simply too small for a card game right now. There are days where you sit for over 10 minutes in a (paid) constructed queue waiting for an opponent. You can't leave the queues screen while you wait. To make matters worse, you can face the same opponents multiple times in these queues, making for a generally boring experience. The draft (or "Arena" if you come from Hearthstone) is basically the same thing, prepare to face the same people in every single draft. Drafts also takes needlessly long, since there are 17 cards per pack the draft portion alone already takes over half an hour. After that, there is 15 minutes for deckbuilding which is also ridiculous, because you can build your deck while drafting. Prepare to waste at least 3 hours on a single draft, with no option to play multiple games at once or even leave the draft queue window. So while you wait you can't even sell your drafted cards or build decks or whatever, you're just stuck in there.\n\nBack to the playerbase: the playerbase is small for good reason. The game is bugged beyond recognition and should for all purposes not be considered a finished product. The patches are few and far between and have not fixed 90% of the bugs. You're going to restart the client a LOT if you want to play this game. Also, there are some bugs that can simply lose you games you would have otherwise won (naming Brown Fox Scout as an example, there are more though). The developers supposedly refund your queue fee if this happens, but these cards have been in the game for YEARS. There is no reason why they should still not work properly.\n\nSpeaking of the developers, there was supposed to be a new set coming out a few weeks ago. Players who happened to stick with the game long enough have been waiting over 9 months for this new set. Any sort of release schedule can not be taken seriously after this joke. 9 months between content updates is not at all acceptable for a card game.\n\nAlso, the sets are too big, being over 200 cards. Just play in a draft to see what I mean. Your first 10 cards will be okay-ish, but the last 7 picks are all completely unplayable trash. This does not make an interesting drafting or viewing experience and it honestly makes me question why the packs are so large and if they put any thought in this at all.\n\nMajor changes have to happen during set 4 and the developers need to wake up. But I think their time and their window of opportuntiy is long gone.\n\nSmall update since set 4 is out now: Set 4 draft is more of the same draft experience as before and has a similar number of completely useless cards in it. I would still recommend anyone to stay away, as there are simply better card games out there.","April 20","false","10.3"," 45 of 93 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","45","93","0","3"

If you are looking for a (slightly) cheaper alternative to MTG online (not Duels) however, then you may have more joy.\n\nIf you are here for a decent amount of hours of free single player campaign though then you should have fun, again, if you can get past the terrible servers and always online single player that loses connection 3 times per game. A small saving grace here however is that the game remebers exactly where you were in your game and can take you back to that exact scenario.\nA negative point however is the dev's seemingly apathetic attitude to fixing any bugs etc that exist in the various PVE modes, why "waste" money and dev time on the free part of the game right?\n\nThe single player campaign is keeping me playing at the moment, which is the only reason this gets a thumbs up, however, the building frustration that i feel towards the always online mixed with terrible servers is making that wear off quite quickly.\n\nRecommended, just, and only if you can put up with server disconnects every 5-20 minutes, which seem WAY worse when playing any PVE (campaign, frost ring arena).","April 24","true","82.0"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

It's like a better version of Magic the Gathering where they didn't ban the Urza sets and just kept going with the combo themes.  Spider decks will make your hair fall out.\n\nIf you've played Magic, you've played something like HEX before.  Not much else to add.  It has a few twists due to being a digital TCG which allows for things you can't do in real life.  NOT like Hearthstone.  The campaign mode is fun and free, getting expanded every few months and will have 3-player raids in the future.\n\nThe closest game to this is actually the rather ancient game of Shandalar, a Magic the Gathering solo campaign mode from the dark ages of computer gaming.  Look it up.\n\nTired of not having people to play card games with at all hours of the day and week?  Then come play here.  Replace your physical cards with digital ones, which still have real world value and can be sold for cash, and come play draft/constructured or PVE with a game not completely revolving around Legendary spam.","May 2","true","62.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","1","4","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NerfedSinistar/recommended/410380/","NerfedSinistar","Nerfed | Sinistar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NerfedSinistar/","141 products in account","HEX: Shards of Wait was a meme circling around on the forums for the longest time that I believe even a guild had established using the very name which was intended to be a joke.. but unfortunately, it isn't funny anymore. I'm not known like some of the other big name's on the gameforge website and thus I'd rather lurk reading massive amounts of information.. at least I did back when I used to be more interested in this game. That being said, I'm going to be touching base on the issues that have diminished the love of HEX for me over a lengthy duration of time in a bulletin format.\n\nI backed this game solely for the player vs environment aspect of a trading card game merged with ambitious massively multiplayer online features. Some of those promises have now came true with the kickstarter rewards finally reaching the appropriate tier backer's accounts; after a long painful wait of 3 years. But that just isn't acceptable for anybody who backed $500 or upwards as I would be very frustrated if put into that situation, but I'm only at the $250 Dungeon Crawler tier so I'm not that invested "initially" as others are. We're still awaiting the grand entrance of the spectral acorn but it will eventually hit the shelves near you in 2017.\n\nThis game has missed so many deadlines that I started questioning whether my microsoft email "scammer" notification(s) I received every-single-time from any HEX related promotional and/or newsletter I get was actually true? My point is, like others have pointed out, these guys couldn't land a successful deadline to save their lives. With an average of 1 set per year for arguably the only way for them to retain players to generate revenue off from has already been concerning since early 2015.\n\n3 years, 1 set for each year. For a game that wants to get into the competitive esports scene that is just laughable. But I give them the benefit of the doubt since it is a digital card game and they do release somewhat close to 300 cards that can get very complexed; generating an astounding amount of bugs that they have to iron out before they can push out the new set. However, this leads to many failed promises and announcements that they've stuffed up over how many times.. I've lost count by now. Although, this game does offer more in terms of gameplay than other ccg and tcgs on the market right now.\n\nDoes anybody remember the kickstarter claiming to have bold figures of in the 30(s) of dungeons and promising raids pitting a few players cooperatively against bosses in delves that would take coordination and strategy with such said groups to overcome? Yeah, well raids isn't in the game and there's like 5 dungeons including the introductory dungeon every race must complete before they reach AZ1.\n\nDon't even think for a solitary second that raids will even be in the game at 2017. I'd say the progression rate of development maybe late 2018. I solely backed this game for that, and after 3 years for a digital card game that shouldn't take any longer than an actual sandbox game to be completed with fully fleshed out features from kickstarter; you'd think they'd at least have 2 players against 2 players in the game.. well no to that also. To top it off, they have a barren wasteland of a PVP format where you construct a deck and hope to find other users to duel. The only part that blows about all of that is there's literally nobody ever in lobby and depending on your timezone; you'd be better off just waiting for a tournament to kick off if you can afford it. There is absolutely no ladder system in place yet for bragging rights within the game. I don't care about leaderboards that is easily manipulated and unfairly calculcated outside of the game which isn't official.\n\nThe Campaign - "Adventure Zone 1" horribly named came out earlier this year with some great features such as: they introduced the first set of characters you'll be travelling with in your journey, unique mechanics and special cards for encounters in specific dungeons along with opening up for the first time giving us a sense of progression within the player vs environment experience we've all been craving since kickstarter.\n\nFrost Ring Arena is literally a string line of encounters with little to no purpose besides grinding for those who have absolutely nothing else to do. The loot you receive isn't chests, it is randomized equipment for the most part that you'll see over and over until you get lucky and maybe.. just maybe then you'd make some platinum off the Auction House. You can also exchange gold for platinum which can be found if you ask other players or the nobles on the very simplistic chat window down the bottom right hand corner.\n\nThey recently supposedly removed the guild features that used to be there as un-clickable boxes ontop of that window container.\n\nGuilds for the most part exist outside of the game only. They host community events and such, but this does little to nothing for the actual game. They generate players who attend such said events that ALREADY play their game.. so what does it actually do for the game they're supporting? This is why it's pointless and it pains me to watch these guilds try to micro manage anything they can salvage to help market the game for HEX themselves. The marketing from HXE is literally non-existant. I don't ever see any advertisements for it on twitch, gaming outlets, popular youtubers or streamers, nowhere to be seen. It's the small portion of the community that has embraced this game as their baby whom are the ones that have backed this game for over $1,000 that has made all of this dedication. I mean to be fair, If I had backed $5,000 like I wanted to, I'd be doing twice as more than most of them to promote this game and make sure it ♥♥♥♥ing sells.\n\nThere's suppose to be guild forts, which won't see the light of day.\n\nThe tournament scene functions exactly like how'd you expect it to. You have the meta that you must follow on the constructed scene if you wish to even participate for a single victory. Drafting barely starts off and it's usually at very odd times, never tried gauntlet or the evo gauntlet but they've been more embraced by the steady concurrent PvPers as of recently so it must be the new hot-spot. This all exists, it is there if you wish to compete against others for packs to re-sell or open for new cards to be added into your collection pool.\n\nAuction House is fair, the system in place allows you to generate gold from playing the free to play aspect of the game to then purchase packs with the earned in-game currency to then use this to re-sell for platinum (real life currency) or to further increase your card pool on drafting and/or other tournament competing features that already exist in the game. You can also purchase equipment, mercanaries that exist solely for PvE at the later stages of their development; or chests that you can roll with earned currency to unlock sleeves and hidden cards spawned only from such said chests.\n\nAll in all, within a little over 3 years worthy of development the content is severely lack luster, this game has missed deadlines, there's tons of promises yet to be seen, their communication with this amazing community they praise and brag about having is at times non-existant and down-right stinks, little to no exposure with absolutely no idea whether that's intentional or not.\n\nthe only thing HXE has going for them is that the game tries to be innovative ontop of a magic the gathering foundation. I say goodluck to cory with his passion and dream, but unfortunately I'm not sure I'm ready to indulge another lengthy, painful and unexpected ride of what HEX has become as of recently.\n\nI will still play when new major patches are released but being a concurrent statistic.. I highly doubt it at this rate.","May 4","false","37.6"," 21 of 45 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","21","45","0","20"

That would be great but WAYYY too stingy with online content. You can play a campaign but if you want to do drafts or sealed, which can only be done with real money, you have to go on trade chat and trade gold for plat and packs. Problem is bc plat is only bought the exchange is ridic. Roughly need 8 hours of grinding games against computer with constructed deck and perfect run before you have enough for a SINGLE draft, which you could get screwed and lose right away or barely get much from. Also theres seperate PVP and PVE cards making what you get from campaign basically useless for getting gold from them or using them to buold a deck and play others. Compared to hearthstone where it takes like an hour 2 days in a row to get enough for arena, where you'll at least get a portion back. Just not worth your time, especially if you don't care about constructed like I don't.\n\nSave your time and money with this pay-2-play dud.","June 2","false","3.5"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","8","20","0","10"

Three years later, there are exactly zero MMO features.  No raids, no guilds, not even a 2 vs 2 mode!  There's only 1v1 and single-player, a far cry from the "engaging, social MMO" we were promised.\n\nInstead, they've spent their time releasing new card-set after new card-set.  Also, the game recently "came out of beta," despite missing nearly all their promised features, because being a beta "is hurting our ability to attract new players".\n\nWhat this tells me is that they're moving towards becoming yet-another Magic The Gathering clone, set up to suck as much money as possible from their users.  Don't get me wrong, I love MTG; but "here's another MTG game" is not what we were promised, and not what we paid $2.2 million for.\n\nUntil Cryptozoic proves they're actually committed to making the game they promised to make, I'm avoiding this game, and I recommend you do the same.\n\n[Edit] I just learned that (as of Nov 2015) this game is published by GameForge, a publisher widely known for ruining games[www.trustpilot.com] by using every scambag tactic to suck as much money out of their customers as possible.

Game mechanics are good, but that's moot as it's impossible to proceed without spending thousands of dollars.\n\nSo your three choices are:\n\n1) Play it for free for a while and risk that when it becomes impossible (and it's time to give up) you'll instead spend money you didn't intend and probably a lot more than you'd bargained for.\n2) Pay to Play, and pay a lot.\n3) Don't play at all.\n\nNote that the difference between commons and rares in this game seems to be MUCH more severe than in Magic: The Gathering.

The AI opponent in one of the duels (In adventure Zone) after turn 4 starts casting random unique troops.  Usually those tropps are pretty good to incredibly good.  Now along with the chance of getting flooded/ have no resources you have to deal with his random cards.  Luck can work out this way, in the first 5-10 games he can get really good troops, in your duels against this AI.  Now the player is winning based on Luck, not on playing the game well.  That is a really bad game design flaw, losing or winning based on luck of the draw, instead of playing hex well.\n\nAnother example is the Gnome Quest.  So your job is to bring back gnomes totaling 60, taking as many trips between 2 sections of the adventure zone with multiple battles.  The gnome cards get put inside your deck and are generally useless.  So the player has to grind many, many battles or hope that he can draw the card he needs without drawing the useless gnomes.  Makes me feel as if I am banging my head against the wall multple times, relying on luck.\n\nThis is a good start, but not enough diversity in the PvE mechanics and serious game design flaws.   The nature of the PvE battles you need to buy booster packs, with rares/legends, to do alright later battles in PvE.  Most of the difficult battles at the end end up being luck if you win, making a player feel like a farming gold bot.\n\nThere are other duels where you have to draw specific cards to win, which makes repeating the same battles many times.  That is horrible gameplay design theory or feature.\n\n--> PvP Content...\n\nThere are drafts, game formats that you can buy into to play against other people.  You can also play in custom matches too.  All of the paying drafts have prizes too, in terms of ingame currency and Booster Packs (16 cards per booster pack).  There is no other game type formats besides 1vs1, would've really liked to see other multiplayer PvP formats.\n\nThere are free, one time PvP booster draft every weekend.\n\n--> The Reource system...\n\nSeems like nearly a direct copy of Magic the Gathering.  It is really basic with 5 differemt colors to seperate out the purpose of the 5 different colored non resource cards.\n\nTo summerize, boring and nearly a direct copy.\n\n--> Crafting?\n\nNothing\n\n--> A Wheel of Fortune, Kismet's Slot Machine\n\nYou get to use a slot machine to upgrade the chest you get from booster pack with better rewards (Eqiupment, cards, sleeves, mercanaries, etc) or get rewards for just rolling the slot machine.  The currency to roll is Gold, which can be earned by playing Arena or Adventure Zone.  Cool feature\n\n--> The parts that work well...\n\nThe auction house in the game works really well.  You can buy PvE and PvP cards and auction your own.  Their are many sorting and filtering options.  The game board is layed out well with as many stops in the gameplay flow as the player wants.  The wheel of Kismet is good too.\n\n--> The Frustrating gameplay mechanic...\n\nIn most DTCG the resource system is simplistic. A example of a simplistic system is hearhstone and Ininity Wars,  An example of an expanded resouce system in Faeria, also on steam.\n\nResouces are mixed into the deck, for HEX.  The recommendation for each deck in HEX to have for resource cards is 40%.  You start the turn taking 7 cards from the top of your deck.  Subsequent turns you draw 1 card per turn form the deck, you draw cards from there are a percentage of games that the player will lose because he does not get enough with his starting digital hand of cards or draws too many resources the beginning, including his cards he drew at the beginning of the games (@ 40% resources)\n\nWhen you have played a lot of games and you still have the resource system do this to the player a quater of the time (at 40% resources) it gets to be a frustrating experience playing the game.  I cannot recommend spending money on this game to other people for this reason, though it is worth a try, as it is F2P.\n\nI really wish the resource system was not simplistic (not including charges), that is my one major gripe for HEX.  It could have been so much deeper and interesting.  Its the one thing that stopping me from recommending this game, because it gives players a loss or win based upon random luck 1/4 of the time versus playing the game well.\n\nWhile having 40% resources in a deck, still getting resources floods and starvation some of the time (recent dungeon lost 3 lives to resource disfunction with same opponent, sarcasitcally great gameplay).  I cannot keep my review at recommend this is getting frustrating to be losing by just bad luck, instead of not playing well.  Heathstone, Faeria and other DTCGs have a less disfunctional resource system.  Changing review to Not Recommend...I really wanted this game to Evolve the DTCG instead of bring the frustrations from paper card games.\n\n-->  Last Thoughts...\n\nRecommend try Faeria first , it does more in its gameplay resource mechanics versus HEX just coping most of the resource system from Magic the Gathering.  For me it just doesn't have enough depth in its basic gameplay systems (including resources) for me to spend money on it.  I will continually give it a try though as it is a F2P game, every so often.\n\nPositives\n+Has a PvE Element with cards related to it.\n+PvE has champions with abilities that level up\n+Cards that can have equipment tied to them to improve said cards\n+Has Auction System\n+Has Chat and email system\n+Adventure system (PvE content) gives you free PvE, equipment and PvP cards.\n\nNegatvies\n+Simplistic resource system that copies too much from Magic the Gathering trading card game (hasbro).  If you want one that has more in depth system try Faeria.\n+PvE adventure is very linear.\n+Dungeon system is very linear too and provides little diversity in the PvE content.\n\nWhat content would change my recommendation to a buy into digital cards/packs?...\n\nMajor...\n-Resource system not tied to your deck/library.\n-Co-Op PvE Comtent\n-Finishing the Guild system\n-Winning PvP Legendary/PvP cards that are bound to your account through some kind of goal / activity\n-More dueling options, customizations (EG restrict Souldbound cards, restrict Set of cards, allow PvE cards, etc)\n-Weekly free draft for everyone, rewarded with soul-bnound /account locked cards\n-Dyanmic PvE world which you can affect that is not so linear.\n\nMinor...\n-Teams of Player vs Player game modes\n-A Risk like map where you control multiple decks.\n\nMISC\nGuild/Clan Community system (Community Feature) has yet to arrive into the game.  See kickstarter HEX.  Also for people that say seperating the resources into a seperate draw pile (EG draw 1 resource per turn) to draw from, it doesn't stop the players from making the same decks they could at any other time.","April 23","false","141.5"," 8 of 27 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","8","27","0","3"

It shouldn't matter which hero/class I select the campaign should be accessible to them all, but far too often I have found the missions too hard or impossible to complete with the available cards provided.\n\nThe strategy of deck building seems pointless since the cards you start with and aquire during the campaign are crap compared to the A.I.'s cards and hero abilities.\n\nAnd my least favorite thing of the game is the shuffler its not very good I could go on and on about it or use more appropriate langauge regarding it but I wont and will simply state that is not very good.  Thats putting it lightly.\n\nTwo currencies for this game the "buy with real money" currency used to buy packs and upgrades and the in game currency "gold" I have found no use what so ever for gold.   People list auctions with buy/bids using gold aside from that what does gold do? what can buy with gold?  No idea I havent been able to find an answer to that.\n\nVisually its very pleasing, for any Magic: the gathering veterans the game will feel very easy to get into.   If your into the PvP and paying real world money for non existant electronic cards then this is the game for you.\n\nIf you aren't into pvp or into spending any real money into this then I only play this if your ok with taking abuse and punishment.\n\nConclusion:  Mechanics are solid, graphics are decent, has some major balance issue with campaign.  I do not recommend this game due to its blatent "real world dollar" grabbing.","April 29","false","56.7"," 12 of 37 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","12","37","0","4"

It's quite entertaining. I can't completely recommend it though.\n\nI started a game, played through the tutorial, made myself a spider cleric champion, made a control deck, played through spider intro quests, adventured and then got into my first real dungeon. The boss slaughtered me completely. My deck isn't able to clear the dungeon - I'm facing a powerful aggro deck against which my unreliable and slow control deck can't win against. If I want to win, I either have to create a new hero or spend money on new cards.\n\nI feel like that's going to be a vicious cycle in games like these. If you want to keep winning, you have to keep spending money on new cards. My excitement to play this game died with that realization.\n\nAlso, this card game incorporated the worst card game element from Magic the Gathering: the system in which you have to draw resource cards from your deck in order to do anything. Not drawing any resources? Tough luck, try again.

I enjoy Hearthstone and MTG (but can't really get into it because of their wanton disregard for digital format).\n\nIt seems interesting, but it hasn't hooked me yet. Its pushing me away if anything. Its ideal to go through the story mode first, and I've got to say it is a major drag. The AI just plain sucks. Sending creatures to attack when they have no business attacking. I just can't get myself to care about the story mode. Its a chore. I can visit 3 "nodes" at most before I have to close the game out of boredom. Its a card game.... I want to play against people...\n\nI havn't delved enough into the custimization, but it appears clunky so far. I get what they are trying to do, but it just seems forced to me. The whole notion of "slotted" cards where you can put gems into them to enchance them just seems absurd to me. I can't imagine most of them would deviate from one specific set up, and even if they did I'd rather it just be 2 different cards to begin with. The custimization is really weird and not in a good way.\n\nThis game is not a major name yet (if ever). I try about 2 new "digital card games" a month. Most of them are whooping stinkers. This one seems to have more potential than most, but the entry barrier is quite high for the position it is in. I have 7 digital card games installed on my pc right now. I'm only going to be significantly invested in 1 or 2 at most. The pricing simply doesn't match its position.

It basically consists of you playing 15 battles against the same 20-25 enemies in a slightly different order each time you play.\n\nIf you want to do something that's actually fun in HEX without paying, here's what you have to do:\n\n1. Grind gold for tens of hours in the mind-numbing Frost Ring Arena untill your eyes bleed or you pass out\n\n2. Buy some boosters, open them, sell the cards to other people for platinum so you have the 100 platinum you need for an entry fee OR try to find someone who is willing to buy your gold for platinum (100 gold for 1 platinum so you'll need 10 000 gold)\n\n3. Now when you have 100 platinum, you need 3 boosters (60 000 gold, if you have a REALLY GOOD deck you can earn around 7 500 gold in 30 minutes, but as a new player you're looking at roughly 5 000 gold for every hour spent grinding AT BEST)\n\n4. Now play draft! Yay! But before you do, make sure you can stay glued to your PC for the next 2 or so hours because you can't leave mid-draft like in Hearthstone. You have to play until you win/lose or quit.\n\n5. Sell all the cards (you keep the cards you draft) to other players so you can hopefully earn most of your entry fee back; if you didn't do well go back to step 1, otherwise go back to step 3.\n\nTL;DR\n\nIf you're playing or have ever played + spent money on MTG or MTGO and have decided to stop for some reason, HEX is a good card game, BUT it is NOT a good videogame. If you're coming from purely digital card game like Hearthstone, wait a few years until HEX becomes playable without paying. By making a digital card game, HEX is competing with Hearthstone and not MTG like they intended years ago. Charging 7 dollars for a draft is a good idea when the competition is charging 14 dollars; however it's not a good idea when the competition is charging 2 dollars. The developers should take advantage of the digital platform and not force people to spend 2 hours playing draft.","April 24","false","9.5"," 17 of 52 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","17","52","0","0"

Create an account and can't log in. This is 15+ hours after "fixing" server issues. Then there the start up and title screen. Since I couldn't get past it I've had plenty of time to notice how un-optimized it is. It felt jaggy and had a slow down. I hope this isn't a foreshadow of what to come when I can finally sign in. For now I'm not going to recommend this game until this sign in fixed. Until I can't leave this reveiw as it stand until actaully play the game.\n\nNow that I've had time to play the actual game I still got to give it a thumps down. It defintely poorly optimized. There are games out there with higher requirements the my laptop can play with no problem, but I have to hold down my mouse button until my action is register. I have to navigate to my group chat each time it fades away, still has bugs that break my perfect statagies, and forgot tring to use the steam overlay. All the slow down issue multiple tenfold.

On the first opening, the game chose a resolution that was the wrong size and left about half of the screen off the game. Since you can't navigate the settings without the mouse, I had to use the mouse to click buttons that weren't actually in the right spot due to resolution issues. Setting the game to the appropriate resolution took nearly 30 minutes of tinkering. Honestly? Your game should be able to detect this and set itself.\n\nAnd then I played for about an hour. It's a really fun game that has cribbed basically everything it does from Magic: The Gathering. I'm not really mad at that, but it does. Some things it gets wrong, though. Normally, in Magic, you can use the activated abilities of cards at any time. In Hex, you can only use them during your first main phase or not at all. Honestly, they should just change this and make it more similar, rather than 'inspired by, but worse.'\n\nThe plot, as it was for the hour I played, was interesting. Good villains, Aztec orcs, etc. Pretty cool.\n\nI tried to log on again today, and the game had the wrong resolution again, but this time it was too small. 3/4 of my screen was white, and the game took up only the portion in the lower 1/4 of the screen. However, now any time I try to change the Settings, the game freezes. It's irritating, and while the game is fun, it's not fun enough to actually go through the effort of fixing their terrible coding.\n\nIt's too bad, really. This was a fun game. I really enjoyed it, and could've seen spending some cash to buy a few cool packs. The problem is that getting  hosed like that for bad coding and then not even having the settings be accessible just killed it for me.\nOh, an additional thing: Wizards are just straight up better, at least at the beginning levels. For some reason, warriors start out with one less card in exchange for an ability of dubious usefullness. Mages and clerics get an extra card, and mages get an extra spell on top of that. They're just straight up better, which kind of sucks in a game that should be about balance and playing cleverly.","April 22","false","31.5"," 9 of 39 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","9","39","0","5"

Each game you play, wether its verses human or AI can essentially be categorised into 3 types of game\n\n1. You suffer resource flood/drought so you'll lose.  Not enjoyable.\n2. Your opponent suffers, and you win.  Not enjoyable.. victory over someone who is flooded is a sucky game\n3.  Either you both suffer or neither of you suffer = good game!\n\nEssentially it means that about 65% of your games are not going to be fun or enjoyable, they are going to be annoying because they have nothing to do with your ability or your deck build.\n\nTo be clear, when I win against an opponent who lost only because of resource issues is NOT FUN.  great you won a game.. but it had nothing to do with you.\n\nHearthstone is the only CCG that resolves this issue... and oh look, its the biggest most popular card game in history. No, I've never played Hearthstone, but highlights my point about all ccg's that follow this exact same resource system where you essentially rely on random luck.\n\nSure, if you dont mind that fact that most of your games are not actually going to be fun to play you'd love hex.. or any ccg,  but I for one dont.    I dont like that the fact that result of my game, win or lose, has nothing to do with my ability or my deck... most of the time.\n\n","April 21","false","0.1"," 10 of 42 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","10","42","0","4"

Players will price their good cards with platinum (of course. I would logically do the same).\nThe game doesn't allow you to earn platinum (that I'm aware of, having played roughly 5 hours). I've done the campaign, VS AI mode in the Frosted Arena, and against random human players. It gives you gold after completing battles. The only cards you can buy with gold are the weak cards. Admittedly, you can build a deck filled with weak cards, but if you've played CCGs before, you know for certain that your deck would only have a realistic chance against similar weak decks.\n\nMinor complaint:\nYou get disconnected if you want to skip the intro.\n\n\nRecommendation.\nThe game should offer a time vs money system. If I'm willing to pay, then I get the cards quickly; VS I'm unwilling to pay but I'll play longer to get the same cards.\n\nThe game needs a way for free users to earn platinum.

The game copies the ruleset of Magic: The Gathering to the letter, just changes the words for certain things (Sorceries become Basic Actions, Instants become Quick Actions, Enchantments are Constants, Artifacts are... still Artifacts, actually).  The upside to this is that if you already know how to play Magic, you know how to play Hex.  The downside is that mana screw/flood is still an issue.  However, Hex does have character abilities (like Vanguard in M:TG) and skill trees that may help (I lost interest too soon to find out; mana screw was one of the main reasons I quit playing Magic).  So, there's a little more depth than Magic, but it's basically the same game.\n\nAt least it doesn't have completely random effects like Hearthstone.  That game is so good until someone plays one of many random effects and then it becomes "Flip a coin to see who wins."

The parts that are not are terrible randomized effects, that removes quite a bit of strategy from the game and makes it all about grinding until you get the roll needed. The blatant copying of MtG is ridiculous as well, even the colors play out almost identical as their MtG counterpart. There are a lot of different rule systems out there, and they work pretty well, so I can only consider this as lazyness or intentional stealing of another system. Sure, other games have similar card effects as MtG, because there's only a finite number of non-stupid card effects, but with different core ruleset the games play out quite differently.\n\nOn the positive side, dungeons and adventures are nice, graphics is good, music is not remarkable but not terrible either.\n\nBut the main reason I'm deleting this game and never touch it again is because the loads of bugs in it. And not just small glitches: card effects not triggering, complete UI freezing, buttons being unclickable for no reason, auction house is so badly designed, it's ridiculous, and sometimes the game just skipped some phases of my turn, so f*** planning.\n\nIf you steal something, at least make something good out of it.

During first few hours I felt like I'm playing 100% MTG with deck full of commons from core set.\nThis game is already like "lets play for one week and uninstall it". If you hate untested games with lots of minimal glitches you shouldn't download it! Just wait half year and then try it. It isn't friendly for lazy players. Many things are time-absorbers, minimal glitching, not important animations (if you dont care about them) which you can't turn off. This game have braindead inventions LOL, which are annoying, and which shouldn't pass beta testing. For me Hex can be very, very good in the future, but now I don't recommend it. Really, just wait half year and then give it a try.\n\n\n+\n*Good if you're looking for something easy, and MTG is too hard for you. Maybe becouse MTGO isn't friendly for new players, unless you know a bit MTG.\n*You can upgrade card's art, I love that!\n*Cards and card's balance is almost 100% from MTG. Core of this game is based on MTG, one of the best TCG games so far.\n*You can pickup equips which can upgrade cards effects, also you can socketing cards. Idk how exactly this works, but I know there's sth like this.\n\n\n-\n*Very bad music and sound effects.\n*Sound options doesn't work, you can only adjust master sound level.\n*Campaign is very monnotony. Like in most TCG/CCG games, I didn't found anything new or interesting here.\n*Campaign lore isn't interesting too.\n*Boosters can be bought for real money and for ingame gold but, the prices are 20k gold per pack, I played 5h and my gold balance is only 4.5k. So, this doesnt satisfying me. Maybe in late game there're much easier ways to make gold.\n*You can't turn off effects, so you have to wait 1-2 seconds to watch an animation 100th time, 1-2 sec isnt much but during one match there's many animations and they extend match lenght by 300%. So, this game isn't friendly for lazy players who doesn't cares about effects.\n*If both you and your opponent have many troops (mtg: creatures) on table you will be extremally confused with very bad made "laser" arrows which shows who attacks who etc. Becouse of that sht you can miss many important moves during match.\n*Glitches or heavy lags, sometimes you have to right click on card 10 times to see it in larger version.\n*Very, very small font in cards what are in hand, so you have to right click them one by one to see larger version, this is waste of time.\n*In deck editor you CANT use arrows to rotate between cards, you have to right click them one by one, again waste of time, normally in other TCG games I need around 2 minutes to check 100 cards, here you will need 15min.","April 22","false","5.0"," 11 of 48 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","11","48","0","7"

The text on the cards is very difficult to read and a little confusing.    The quests are boring,  the little text theatre that nobody reads looks boring.

So let's say a sapphire card requires that you have 2 sapphires unlocked, but you keep drawing every other type of gem - or you don't draw any gem cards and just draw combat cards.\n\nVice versa you keep drawing gem cards and can't draw any combat cards.  You'll just sit there and watch your hero quickly killed while you can't do anything about it.  So you'll enter the deck builder and increase the number of gem cards that are in your deck, therefore increasing the likelyhood that you can draw some gems, which will allow you to play combat cards.  Then you'll start drawing nothing but gem cards and have no combat cards in your hand with which to attack or defend.  Or the combat cards you can draw require more gems than you can draw. You could literally be killed by a single 1/1 card hitting you down to 0 health because you can't play anything.\n\nBasically this game requires your RNG to grant you the perfect mix of resource cards and combat cards, which is very unique (see: flawed and stupid).  There's a reason that most other card games don't do this - IT DOESN'T WORK.\n\nGreat artwork, neat campaign and story, cards feel reasonably balanced, you can tell a lot of work and care went into making this game, but it's fatally flawed.\n\n3/10.  Oops, let's draw again: 7/10.  Nope, that's not it, draw again 5/10. 10/10? 6/10? 2/10 5/10 2/10 4/10, ah, there we go! 4/10.","May 7","false","5.8"," 13 of 55 people (24%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","24","13","55","0","17"

If you're looking for something cheaper or more accessible, there's Hearthstone, Spellweaver, SolForge, Card Hunter... and a ton more I'm probably forgetting. By slavishly copying Magic's mechanics without having Magic's design team to back it up, Hex fails at both strategic depth and accessibility.\n\nI'm a huge fan of TCGs, and have played many of them.

It LOOKS like the card is wearing an item. but i believe I'm supposed to equipt it to my hero to get the effect. So I go to my inventory... Oh I don't have that item... shouldn't it be labeled or something atleast? like have or not have? general confusing item system.\n\n\nSo many things in this game are too annoying to get into it, a shame because generally I like the card design but there are so many other options TCG wise, where I don't feel so forced to buy cards.\n\nfourth match against human, the opponent played same type of deck as me. except they dropped a 28k gold card on turn two, it was literally like 2.5 of my two drops in one card, the power spike for more expensive cards is insane. conceded instantly, no thanks, unwinable just because better cards.\n\ncertain mechanics aren't explained well\n\nsome kind of "luck bag" thing in the arena.\n\neach player is given 3 "luck bags" one is unlucky and a negative effect, use mana to open them.\n\nOK I did.\n\nI opened it annnnnd... all 6 luck bags on the field just vanished with no explanation whatsoever. great mechanics there.\n\n\nAgain, generally I like the card design, i pretty much hate everything else about this game.","April 19","false","4.4"," 18 of 89 people (20%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","20","18","89","3","3"

This MTG sued wannabe clone shoulda learned something during their 2 year beta before coming to steam. Check the positive reviews, most of those are writen by Hex white knights, game is nothing like its being described.\nGo play Duelyst or android TCG and save yourself some time\n\nWhy not recommened, well  for starters it doesnt add anything new, a sued clone of MTG, you either win or lose  based on  an obsolete mechanic: mana draw. You either get enough mana cards or you dont, plain and simple.\n\nThen you have the P2W aspect, to be able to participate on PVP you either farm PVE at a snail pace just to buy some packs or you get your wallet up and make yourself the best P2W deck posible. You will have the white knights of this game  cutting their wrist defending this aspect, in their  peasant minds this is what make hex unique, a mmo TCG, being able to buy every card with money, you can buy cards with pve currency which is gold but its garbage cards that you can get by playing yourself and most of them are only good for PVE, so you play PVE to get a PVE deck and grind gold to be able to paly PVP in a month from now if you have a life, or you get your wallet buy platinum and start PVP today.\n\nWill the mana draw mechanic be changed?, most likely not and with that decision this game  will soon be forgotten like spellweaver and any game that in 2016 decides  mana draw is still a thing.\n\nThen comes the small PVE campaign,  i think max lv for the campaign is 8 or 9, that lv you can get it in a single day if you are a grinder, am lv 7 and been playing on and off for 2 weeks doing the fight nodes slowly since there is nothing else once you complete other than creating a new hero and repeat so in a single day you see everything the games has to offer and then you just grind gold to transform it to platinum( premiun currency used for everything PVP related) and try PVP.\n\nPlayersbase was really small for what i saw, in the 2 week i been on and off, its the same 10 or so  guys chatting online usually a newbie like me asking PVE questions related, again the white knight will say this isnt so the game is a WOW killer blablabla, i dont think the total playerbase is over 1k a lot of people complained on the HEX forums about  long PVP queues and when they do they had to fight the same guy over and over because there wasnt anyone else on queue\nWill this be fixed by being on steam: No\nIn order to create a stable playerbase the game needs a stronger PVE component which all the white knights dont want they want more  PVP  features but those mentally challenged few dont understand is that the game without PVE has zero draw to keep a players more than  a single day once they  check the lacking PVE.\n\nThen you have the game that is run by Gameforge, a company that is known to drain games of their life and then toss their husks once they stop making money.","April 19","false","0.1"," 16 of 91 people (18%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","18","16","91","2","2"

I mean makes sense. Visiting the Auction House, filtering by legendary and just browsing thru cards starting with A I found a few that cost 2000p per and they seemed pretty good. There was an angel that costs 4 but the turn you draw it costs 0 to cast so yea 8000p for a playset.\n\nI couldn't find booster packs buyable with in-game currency nor were any of the legendaries available in the AH buyable with gold so yea. There is some spinning thing but I don't have the patience to learn how it works but given the things I already listed I sincerely doubt you will be getting that sweet sweet angel anytime soon without real moolah.\n\nWhat those mtg/hs wanna bes don't get is that both of those games have inherent value that have been developed for a while. Those dudes just want to come in half cocked and charge same or more as them. Those companies have invested quite a lot to get to the point where they can sell crap at such prices. Plus you can be pretty sure that they will both be around for a long time.\n\nNow if you have not invested in either hex is probably deeper and better than hs but not mtg. For free play I doubt you can be at all competitive in this game and lets face it: who the heck wants to play a tcg against a dumb AI to grind worthless gold they cannot get the real sweet card with, let alone a playset.\n\nTo the developers: I suggest you drastically lower your prices and free to play structure until you have a good enough base that you can start increasing your prices as your expirience starts increasing because you are not magic's R&D that has been doing this crap for 22 years and have balancing and interactivity down to an art. Or maybe try the whole LCG thing and be at least a bit innovative in the field.\n\np.s. i am very rich, i have everything for both paper and mtgo, full all gold collection on hs, full collection on dyelist (which i actually will recommend way way over this pile) and whatever else. I spend at least 2k/month on games alone, and that is when there is nothing new. I am saying this so you understand I can go in right now and buy it all, even at those prices, but I am just sick and tired of companies coming in and trying this crap. I mean I waste my money but not like this.\n\np.s.s. also for 350$ bucks you can buy a pretty high end magic online deck and at least have some real fun + play in tournaments and leagues where you can make real money and when you get tired you can sell that deck, take a small hit and go play something else. And sometimes you might even make more money than you spent if your deck became more popular. for instance back in the day when liliana of the veil was released I bought a playset for 30$ a piece and then when they rotated out of standard sold them for 150$ a piece... so yea like that.","April 19","false","1.5"," 16 of 92 people (17%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","17","16","92","8","19"

Just another PAY 2 WIN game hidden behind the word FREE lol. I love their shills trying to say it's not. Just like all the rest you MIGHT can get all the cards for free but do you know how long that will take? If you don't PAY for good cards you'll never be competitive just like ALL THE REST. Cory Jones is a Joke. Trying to make you believe that it's so easy to get ALL the cards and it's not JUST LIKE ALL THE REST. Listen to him (trueist sense of the word. lol) You just try to be COMPETITIVE and I mean win 98% of the time with the crap cards they give you vs the good cards they will let you BUY!\n\nDO NOT BUY....just another PAY 2 WIN game. :)\n\nUPDATE MAY 17th....Spending a little more time with the game I've discoverd that the AI cheats beyond measure.....we're only suppose to get 4 cards of any one card and the AI can basically have any card it wants and in large quantities. It has a habit of playing 6 of one card in a row if losing. It also appears to go in the deck data file and pull the perfect counter card for the card you played. Many times when I'd play something it would play a like something and usually more than one. Flyers for instance. I've watched it play SIX cards in a row of the same card cause I eliminated the others and was winning. It played 6 spider cards that generate 3 spiders in your deck SIX times in a row one game in the prologue.\n\nThe game is a horrible grind with a frustrating AI. Oh it's beatable but the time it takes to beat it is the kicker. Spending 30 minutes beating it just frustrates to no end. I can see why they are doiing this now. The longer it takes and the more frustrated you get they HOPE you will BUY plat from the store to play in tournaments where the REAL pleasure of the game is located. But, making you take days to earn enough plat for one tourney is rather boring an unfun. The grind in the Arena and cheating AI is the same there as it is in the campaign.\n\nSo, in my opinion they want you to go through hell to make any plat. Frustration leads to two things...Either BUY PLAT and CARDS or quit.....I chose the latter. It's not worth my time to grind like this or the frustration. You're just wasting your time for really nothing. Even the tourneys are just money grabs if you don't have any plat.....You'll have to BUY it with real money. So, basically it's just like I said above a Pay to Play in the name of Free to play....yeah it's free to play alright but if you really want to do anything that is fun you'll end up paying to win/play.","April 19","false","104.7"," 14 of 109 people (13%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","13","14","109","4","29"

The game has two engaging PVE formats that can be replayed almost an infinite number of times to gain new cards, gold, platinum, etc. For the more competitive players the game has several PVP formats that let you match up against other players in familiar tourney types such as draft, constructed, and gauntlet.\n\nThe long-term plan is where Hex really shines.  At the current rate of content rollout it may take a few years before Hex has all of the features that they promised players but that ensures a long and hopefully healthy life for this game. The cards in the game have real money value and some gamers do play this game to make real cash from tournaments or sale of in-game items. The rollout of new PVE and PVP content over the next few years will likely continue to increase the value of the cards so that any players getting into Hex now should be able to "cash out" later for a nice payday. The game requires no money to play and is not Pay2win since you can get all of the cards by simply grinding out games against the AI many times. For those people who prefer to buy the cards with real money that option is available and saves a lot of time but doesn't make you a better player. In short, skill is rewarded in this game.","April 19","true","169.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I don't really play TCG, so I can only give the perspective of a total noob, which is the main reason I didn't recommend it.\n\nFor a game that is able to be free thanks to the whole Kickstarter campaign, it's certainly worth giving a shot. No complaints in terms of the graphics, or the artwork. My lower-end laptop runs the game perfectly fine. It kinda saddened me that the extended artwork on the cards was literally just the whole card picture without the info on it, but the detail is still good.\n\nThis game doesn't serve anything up on a silver platter, so everyone who's used to winning everything at the start is going to get a rude awakening much like I did. I suppose that would make for much more exciting gameplay, since players can't just breeze through high-level matches with OP cards later on, but... still. Noobs need some help, or they're going to become cannon fodder to AI enemies.\n\ntl;dr it's all about the heart of the cards and the luck of the draw.","April 24","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tmcookiez/recommended/410380/","tmcookiez","<™[-=> Cookiez <=-]™>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tmcookiez/","177 products in account","It's a pay-to-win game but there is a free campaign that makes up for the major negative. There are 2 kinds of currency in the game, Gold and Platinum. Platinum is the cash shop currency while Gold is the in-game currency which you can earn from completing quests. The best exchange rate I saw was $150 for 9000 Platinum (40 Platinum per $1), each booster pack costs 200 Platinum. You can basically get 45 packs for $150.\n\nAfter playing the game, I would recommend the campaign but not the multiplayer as that would be a money drain. The campaign is honestly very good but you only need to complete it with 1 race as it's the same trail with all the others. You just want to create new champions to get the rare cards.\n\nPROS\n1. Interesting Storyline/World\nBasically divided into a centuries long battle between light and dark, with the Ardent as the light and the Underworld as the dark. A long time ago, a meteorite crashed onto the planet creating magical shards and everyone called it Hex. The meteorite also brought along some undead called the Necrotic. The Necrotic was attacked by the Human, Elves, Coyotyl\n\n2. Hero Powers / Charges\nThere is a way to play even if your hand is full of mana-producing gems called Charges. Once you get enough charges, you can use a hero power to change the gameplay. There are usually a couple to choose from.\n\n3. Interesting Races\n8 in total\nArdent - Human, Elf, Orc, Coyotl (coyotes)\nUnderworld - Necrotic, Dwarf, Shinhare (bunnies), Vennen (spiders)\n\nThe standard Tolkien fare of Human, Elf, Orc, Dwarf and Undead have been used and re-used so many times that it's a given cliche. It is pretty interesting to see the Coyotyl which are based on Native American tribalism, Shinhare based on Japanese Imperial rule and Vennen based on an insect Hive.\n\n4. Classes\n3 main classes :\na. Cleric : Pray, Shard Attuned, <Racial Talent>\nb. Warrior : Battle, Shard Attuned, <Racial Talent>\nc. Mage : Replenish Spell Power, Learn Spell Soothsaying, <Racial Talent>\n\nI expect Warlock, Rogue and Ranger classes to appear in the future.\n\nAll races have access to the same classes. What I like about the variety is that while the basic skills are the same, the racial talent will vary depending on what race you picked. There are also Race-Class Combos which pair up with the Racial Talent ensuring that different heroes can change how a deck is played. I am expecting more classes in the future which will probably follow the standard World of Warcraft model.\n\n5. Campaign\nThe campaign is pretty impressive. This is the one thing that I would recommend to people. There is a narrative and a proper game with a leveling up system. It's a pity for the ridiculous exchange rates.\n\n6. Abilities that will be a Hassle in a Physical Card Game\na. 2 random troop cards in your deck get +1/+1, next troop in your deck gets +1/+1\n\nTo be totally fair with physical cards, you would need a 3rd party to randomly search through all the troop cards and do the above by placing markers on the card. If you do it yourself or get your opponent to do it, there might be cases of cheating or information given away.\n\nb. Summon a Random Creature\n\nYou can't do that with physical cards. You would need a list, a proxy card and list of random creatures to randomise with.\n\nc. Socketing\n\nYou would have have to prepare a marker in the card to show it's additional unique ability.\n\nCONS\n1. Pay To Win\nThis is really hardcore pay to win. You can't even grind to catchup. The 200 Platinum required for a pack is ridiculous. That averages out to $5 per booster pack minimum. It usually costs more.\n\n2. Ridiculous Grinding / Exchange Rate\nYou need approximately 20,000 gold to trade for 1 booster pack. You earn 200 gold per battle in the campaign. You need 100 battles just to bid for the 1 booster pack.\n\n3. Random Number Generator\nCan one complain about how similar the mulligan rule is to Magic the Gathering and how it forces you to mulligan your whole hand? It would have been better if you could keep some cards and mulligan the rest, similar to Hearthstone.\n\n4. Auction House\nThe search filters are extremely bad. You will see multiple copies of the same card for many pages and you are unable to skip ahead. The load times between page refreshes are also extremely long. This ensures that players only get to see cards that start with the letter A.\n\n5. No Heroes directly affecting the field\nSure, there are charges for hero abilities but the hero can't do anything without charges. E.g. Attack a Minion directly\n\n6. Auto Full-Healing of Troops\nStill a major problem. This makes +1 HP way too valuable as all you need to do is survive the engagement.\n\n7. No Targetting of Blockers\nYou can't choose who to attack, only the blockers get to choose.\n\n8. Mana-Screwed\nToo many or too few. You die either way.\n\nNEUTRAL\n1. Gem Socketing\nInteresting to note but there is a slight negative in the idea that you have to get a specific gem to socket it rather than choosing a variation of the card. I think Hearthstone has the same idea.\n\nSUGGESTIONS\n1. Gender Discrepancy\nThis is sure to create controversy and attract attention to the game. Make the females have a different variation of racial talents from their male counterparts and let the players decide which is stronger.\n\n2. Auction House\nAdvanced search parameters to remove cards that have a certain keyword from the search. E.g. "-Abominate", no Abominate cards will appear.","April 21","true","44.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","35"

There are very little restrictions.\n+The PvE/Campaign of this game can is brutal but rewarding\n+So many different styles of gameplay\n+PvE (Brutal and completely unfair at early stages)\n+Create your own customizable character for the campaign\n+Very engaging competitive play\n+Admins/Developers are available everyday. They are actively in the game's global chat every single day.\n\nCons:\n-PvP packs can only be purchased through premium currency (But can be bought from players with PvE currency)\n-PvE Campaign is not beginner friendly. Some missions require a specifically built counter-deck\n-Slow development on PvE content\n-Beginner f2p players will be utterly destroyed in PvP until they can build their collection up\n-Personally, I dislike the resource system where the resources used are also cards that must be accounted for during deck construction and drawn. You can lose a game right at the mulligan if your luck is that bad and/or if the resource to non-resource ratio in your deck is unbalanced.\n\nNeutral:\n>Grind heavy for currency and character exp\n>Games are around 15-40 minutes\n>Princess Cory (The boss fight)\n>There is a fair amount of RNG applied to some cards. The RNG is absolutely insane. You can spend 1 resource to summon a god or 10 resources to summon a cardboard box.\n\nOverall:\nIf you're looking for a card game with complexity and insane 40 minute battles between 200 troops, this is the game for you. I'm not even exaggerating, I actually had matches where each side of the field was around 100 troops each. If you have the patience to grind out gold to buy cards and learn the mechanics of....everything, then I highly recommend this game. You don't have to pay any real cash to make progress, but it makes it easier. With an ever changing meta and a constant stream of new deck concepts, the scene and the market are always changing.\n\nTL;DR:\n*Play if you like complex card games with ridiculously convoluted mechanics both PvP and PvE.\n*Not beginner friendly and premium currency is a luxury, not a necessity. Premium currency can be obtained through the game's market for non-premium currency.","June 6","true","169.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
