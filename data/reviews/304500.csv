This was back when the shovelware developers were on the casual PC market bandwagon before they all moved to making iPhone clone games. Somehow, bizarrely, in the sea of match-3 and hidden object games there was what I now consider to be an All Time Indie Classic, Rooms: The Main Building.\n\nRooms was also released on Nintendo DS where it was largely ignored because of no marketing (that I know of), and despite me stumbling upon the game at B.F.G., it was definitely not getting the attention it deserved on PC. Furthermore, after B.F.G. was hacked all those years ago, it really put me off wanting to install their client again since Rooms was basically the only reason to do so. But now I don't have to worry about it because Rooms is on Steam!\n\nI don't know if Rooms would be in my all-time top ten, but it is certainly my number one favorite puzzle game ever. As much as I love Portal and the Popcap games, I like Rooms even better. Take it from someone who owns almost a thousand Steam games: this is one of the best.","July 12, 2014","true","5.6"," 59 of 73 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","59","73","0","0"

(I'm not sure where you would find more levels for download, but apparently you can?) The twist is that you can only slide the piece you're on, so the game introduces mechanics for you to switch tiles: you can use a ladder, teleport yourself, switch out the level, and more. There are also locked doors, keys, explosives...\nBut wait, there's more, it gets meta. At the same you are moving the tiles, you also need to place them correctly so the background picture will look right in the end. If you manage that, you unlock items. And even more meta: these items can be used in a small point&click that is framing your puzzle endeavours.\n\nIt's all wrapped up in some photographic art that, despite being 1024x768 (the game scales it up for you if you like) does the job admirably, as does the slightly jazzy music that gives the game an old-time London feel. But you can see that from the trailer and the screenshots.\n\nSolid puzzler, lots of (up to now) casual puzzles that provide a soft learning curve, and are orginal and fun to do. It took me about 1 hour for the first 20 levels of 100. I'm definitely going to finish this game.","November 26, 2014","true","2.4"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","25","28","2","0"

Rooms: The Main Building awakens many of these happy feelings and surprises in the game mechanics department.  Innovative, odd and quirky at times, the bottom line is a good little game like this deserves your attention and there is a sequel which is imminent… I will Definitely be picking up the sequel.\n\nDetails\nYour character must exit from the Tile Grid by walking into The One Tile with an Exit Door. While moving between two adjacent tiles may be as simple as walking left to right or using a ladder to go up and down, most of the game will require skillful reorganization of tiles to get around obstructed walls, teleportation with your cellphone, pumping water out of flooded tiles, tile swapping, taking the subway and more. While the each of the game mechanics are simple, layering them generates complex puzzles. Thankfully the developers showed restraint and the resulting suite of  100 puzzles progress well. The tougher puzzles lend themselves quite nicely to trial and error to open up possibilities when the brain becomes over taxed with abstract rules. The developers have included a tool for generating your own puzzles which you could take to a masochistic level of complexity…. Your personal puzzles are saved to your steam folder and can be exchanged with your homies.\n\nWhat does not work in this game? There is a simple yet odd adventure story with hidden objects that tie together the 4 mansions, each mansion housing the 25 puzzle rooms; a clunky VN style interface; small video sequences for all character movements that are tooooo long; the audioscape is barely tolerable, there is no voice acting - only zoo zoo pet sounds, and I had to turn off the music; the internal achievement system did not recognize three quarters of  what was finished; there are no steam achievements; YET all of this is Completely Forgivable because sometimes a game is just good; in fact this game deserves a 10/10. I am excited about the sequel coming out this year, this is a Definite Buy in my universe.\n\nBuy this game Rooms: The Main Building if you would like a Zen and calming puzzle experience bringing the classic 2D Sliding Tile puzzle game to the third if not fourth dimension. You should buy if you like Different.","March 28, 2015","true","17.2"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/304500/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","It's telling that the only time I identified with my character in Rooms: The Main Building was when he cried out in exasperation about how the game wasn't over. Rooms touts its 100 levels like a plea to justify its existence as a retail release, but this ends up being more than anyone would ever want. The myriad twists and tweaks just don't entertain much over the course of the stupid single-player story, leaving a game whose sometimes minor issues drag it deep into the realm of mediocrity.\n\nRooms' story mode is a tale about a young man who gets trapped in a world he can only escape from by solving slide puzzles. And while traditional slide puzzles are completed by moving pieces around so that they make a picture or form a word, these one see you guiding your character through the puzzle itself, with the ultimate goal of unlocking a doorway to the next level. Forming pictures is still important if you want to get a "Gold" rating for the level, but it's not essential, acting as a guide for completion rather than the way to play a given puzzle. That probably sounds pretty dull... and that's because, well, it is: guiding your character through door after door becomes increasingly monotonous, and each successive stage made me feel more like a videogame Sisyphus than a slide-puzzle mastermind.\n\nThankfully, the team behind Rooms apparently realized that the small twist of guiding a character through puzzles rapidly becomes a bore, and added a series of twists that help inject some variety -- at least for a short while. Throughout the course of the game, additional mechanics are slowly introduced, including teleporters, water-filled rooms, and magic cupboards that switch tiles' places. These quirks add a sense of spontaneity to the level design; toward the end of the game, these elements often get pulled together within a single stage, creating deceptively difficult puzzles that are downright satisfying to solve. It's unfortunate, though, that the number of clever, challenging puzzles gets overshadowed by a host of mind-numbingly simple levels that fail to engage for any extended amount of time.\n\nI'd have a lot less to gripe about if I could have just jumped to the challenging levels right off the bat, but Rooms forces you to suffer through a painfully written story alongside the sequential slog. The plot makes a go of integrating some point-and-click adventure game-style stuff into the mix, with a small world that you explore and interact with via items unlocked during the puzzle portion. Calling it "interaction" is actually quite generous, though, as my ability to influence and participate in the world was so scripted that every such task was simplistic at best.\n\nSo the adventure game elements are a bust, but Rooms takes a stab at introducing variety with its other modes. The only problem: they're either fundamentally broken, or locked from the get-go. The few interesting mechanics that are mixed into Rooms' slide puzzles just aren't enough to make it entertaining from start to finish, and the coolest modes are locked from the start. The Wii and DS versions may be $30 budget titles, but even that seems grossly overpriced when the same game is available on the PC for less than $10. Overall 5/10.","September 23, 2015","true","13.3"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

The objective of each puzzle is to reach the exit, but simply sliding tiles is not enough. Each tile can have different elements such as ladders, teleportation phones, tile swapping cabinets, subway rides, water hazards, and more. These elements add an extra layer of depth into the simple slider concept. The puzzles are very engaging and the difficulty ramps up well as the game progresses.\n\nAll these puzzles are wrapped neatly into an elaborate fantasy story that ties everything together nicely--very enjoyable.","July 9, 2015","true","7.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

If you can get past its ugliness, it’s a nice, although not particularly hard game.\n\nLong version:Although Rooms: The Main Building was originally released on PC, it is mostly known as a Nintendo DS title. It certainly fits the bill with its simple design: a sliding puzzle where you can only move the tiles while your character is standing on them. To move the character, several other mechanics (ladders, keys, explosives and so on) are introduced, creating additional challenges.\nThe game isn’t particularly hard, even most of the high-level puzzles can be solved with enough trial and error. But there is a hundred of them, so it may last some time.\n\nThe main downside of Rooms is the visual presentation. Even if it was a handheld-exclusive, the dull colours (everything is black, brown, orange or red) and the choppy, jaggy animation and objects are just not pleasing to look at. But if you can get over it and enjoy the game for what it is, Rooms may entertain you with its puzzles for a decent amount of time.","February 4, 2015","true","7.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Many objects have only one way to be used, and are obviously used only once in a puzzle.\n\nMaking things more annoying, you only get "gold" completion for leaving the final puzzle pieces in a particular arrangement, basically ensuring there is one and exactly one set of moves the game designers had in mind, and all deviance or creative puzzle solutions are properly punished for not behaving exactly as the developers demand of you.\n\nBeyond that, the animations are far too long, and I spent easily half the game impatiently waiting for animations to finish.  The subway is a praticular offender, as it takes about 10 seconds of waiting before you get character control back when you invariably have the next 2-3 moves planned out, and there's no real excuse for any of these animations taking more than half a second.  The interface is mouse-only (probably a tablet port) and takes annoyingly precise clicks, with your character grabbing the ladder when you want them to use the wardrobe, or drowning herself if you click on the water instead of the fishbowl she wears to not drown.  (Oh, did I mention the game's objects are completely random and illogical?)\n\nThe game is dripping with how British their characters are, (although the backgrounds are obviously hinting at Paris,) but the English itself is constantly awkward, like they aren't native speakers.\n\nI slammed through the main game in just about 3 hours or so, and wasn't really trying to hurry it up.  There's no particular replay value, either, although there is a "bonus rooms" set of 20 more levels I was too bored to complete, totaling 100. Since these levels last about a minute if you have a clue what you're doing, though, it's not as expansive as it might sound.  The non-level segments are even more annoying, just a forced inventory puzzle with no mystery, being the world's most boring point-and-click with terrible dialogue.\n\nOnly get if you really, really like these sorts of puzzle games, and it's on sale for $2 or less.  If you only got it in a bundle, farm your cards, delete, and banish it to the junk drawer of your Steam library.","September 21, 2015","false","3.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There is however only 1 way to solve it while leaving each room in the correct position so that it lines up a background picture. Achieving this is the only way you will get gold on each puzzle and see a secret ending which I myself am yet to see thanks to 5 puzzles causing me to wish i had more coffee in the house.\n\nHaving said that it isn't a difficult puzzle as it is more fun and you should be able to progress through this one alone without the need of a youtube walkthrough.\n\nBit dated in graphics, but it has steadily grown popularity through its availability on various platforms. I myself played it on the NDS and as soon as I saw it on Steam I immediately bought it. Hoping one day to see that elusive ending.\n\nThe downfalls of this game is that 1) There is no Steam Achievements and 2) The map maker which goes with the game is not Steam Workshop integrated so sharing your created master pieces will never be convenient.\n\nIf you like puzzle games and looking for that something completely different.

If it had options to allow it to run properly on modern PCs, it would probably get a thumbs up.  But it doesnt, so it doesn't.","January 4","false","3.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

You have different tiles which can slide around a field. Each one, however, has unique items such as keys, candles, or phones which allow you to have certain abilities like teleport or opening doors. You have to combine them in a way to reach the end. It seems simple but there are a lot of items and elements that come into play. Progression is split into 4 “worlds” so each world tends to introduce 2-3 elements that are usually used until the end of the level. Overall, it’s OK.\n\nThere is also a “hub world” (3 doors) that include more of a traditional point and click section where you need to use items in order to get puzzle pieces. This part of the game seems very unnecessary and rushed. You only have like 10 objects which defeats the point of having a limited inventory and seems like they made it for the sake of having it.\n\nStory\nYou’re a dude that’s been trapped in a world where you have to solve puzzles… It’s not really much of a story and it seems contrived. In reality, there isn’t anything important here.\n\nGraphics/Performance\nThe game has an element of FMV in it and it looks different but it lacks good resolution options and level detail. Overall, it’s passable but only barely so. The game ran fine but you would hardly notice with the lackluster presentation.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nIt’s OK. The game was always accessible to me and was unique which is good. However, if the game was any longer, I would just give up on it. Play it if you really like puzzle games. Otherwise, leave it.\n","February 1","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is basically shifting rooms around and using various tools to get to the exit of each map (eg. ladders, explosives, Matrix-style phones and Narnia-style wardrobes :D)\n\nPros:\n+ Noticeable that a lot of effort went into the making of the game\n+ Good puzzles, some were a bit too hard for me to do without a guide :D\n+ Good music, even if somewhat repetitive after a while\n+ Relatively intuitive UI\n\nCons:\n- Bland story (as far as I could follow - I accidentally skipped a whole dialogue in the beginning)\n- Some of the animations are too long, which is annoying after their novelty wears off (worst offender in my game so far is the subway station)\n- The graphics feel quite choppy, but the level of detail put into them is noticeable and admirable\n\nI'm not sure I'd recommend it for this price, but get it on a sale if the above sounds interesting.","July 11, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Has great brain-teasing puzzles with an excellent learning curve. The antique+steampunk+British art style and music go well together within the game. Story-telling is also interesting, especially towards the end (but my lips are sealed!). Surely there are rooms for improvement(e.g.: needs an "undo" button), but considering the circumstances, it's still a well-made piece of art. This game has substantial amount of clever puzzles and a level editor that will keep you entertained for hours and hours.
