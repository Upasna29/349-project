Starting with load bug crash fix\n\nThe developer is quick with the response to our issue and has said for now if you run the game via the exe in the games folder then the crash bug will no longer be an issue and they will work on a permenent fix to allow it to launch through steam.. And as for the snap turining there is an option in the menus to turn it off....So with that all sorted i can safely say this game is truly awesome and a must have for any virtual reality fan as its by far one of the best experiences out there :)","April 21","true","0.3"," 24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","24","36","0","1"

I can fully recommend this game if you you are in search for cyber steampunk feeling.\n\n\n\nbut there are some points you need to know:\n\n\n1.  you still cant start the game from steam because it with crash - but the workaround works (start the .exe file directly).\n\n2. the VR experience is incomplete.\nYou can move ingame by moving in real life (oculus roomscale works fine) - if you have a large enough room, long enough cables and no problem with breaking your nose when running against a wall or strangle yourself with the cables. after a while i gave up and sat down and moved around with the xbox controller (no sickness issues for me).\n\nAlso you interact with the gameworld by looking at something and press a button on your x-box controller. that feels more like a point&click game, not like a complete VR experience.  i think you need the touch controller and a simulation of your hand position for this type of game.\n\n3. the difficulty level... well there is no difficulty. you just advance through the game. it doesnt have to be a bad thing. I have played all 3 Shadowrun games and they too had no difficulty level at all and they are among my favorite games.\n\n4. It is a Indie game and with it come some limitations. nothing that reduce the overall experience, but dont expect a multi million dollar aaa title when you pay 20€/$. the game is very strong in delivering a cyber steampunk feeling.\n\n5. all VR games seem to be pretty "flat" when it comes to game mechanics and story telling. they all feel like someone had a cool idea and made a techdemo and then tried to build a game around that techdemo. all VR games i have played so far are very polished and with high amount of nice little details everywhere, just with no depth. Technolust is no exception.\nI like it and i would probably buy a sequal, but if i compare it with a 20€ shadowrun game, there is so much more gameplay in flat games of the same price class. its almost like all the budget is spent for researching VR possibilitys and building the enviroment and nothing is left for creating content.","May 8","true","5.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

However these opinions are my own!\n\nMeatspace got you down? Then spend some time in Technolust!\n\nTechnolust is a cyberpunk style adventure narrative experience for VR and it is REALLY awesome, if you like Bladerunner or The Fifth Element then you'll love this. Technolust is very replayable and there is lots to explore and do, it's also great to just spend time in and take in the futuristic dystopian cityscape. I've personally spent hours and hours just chilling in the safehouse admiring the vast cityscapes when meatspace got me down.\n\nI'd highly reccomend Technolust, launch issues are only temporary and will be fixed.","April 25","true","0.1"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","2"

It is the most entertaining thing I've done in VR so far. Is it long, unfortunatly, no. Is it worth the price? yes. Its not a 70 dollar AAA title with 150 worth of DLC but I got my moneys worth. I loved the atmosphere. I love d the flow and the use of VR landscapes. I love the cyberpunk and the music!\n\nI want to strongly encourage the developers of this game to continue forward and make a LONGER game. I'll save up 60 dollars for that one!\n\nAwesome game.","May 28","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Made me walk like a drunk ingame.\nTried comfort mode but didn’t like it because I don’t get sim-sick in VR.\nAlso worldscale is totally off for me, stuff ingame looks 3x times bigger than in real life.\nStill think the game could be fun, would buy it again if the issue with the right stick gets patched.","May 5","false","0.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","1"

This is a really neat VR experience.  This is a good exploring type game with a lot of the gaming and some movie articles from the past.  I did not think it was a difficult to play game.  The hardest part for me was beating the high score in the arcade.  I did enjoy the music in the game and found it available on bandcamp.  There is a lot to do in the arcade that I am goina keep this game in my library just to relax and play some of these VR arcades.  I thought the ending was pretty good.","May 27","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has incredible music and great environments that really make you feel like you're trapped in a 90s vision of a dystopian future.\n\nBefore playing this game, I've got to warn you: It's not action-packed (except in the arcade minigames), and it won't hold your hands. It's an exploration game, and while it's possible to sprint to the ending in relatively little time, you're going to have a lot more fun if you slow down and try everything in the environment. There's a reason the world is full of collectables, arcade games, TVs and advertising - Technolust is about getting you immersed, and it does an exceptional job at that.\n\nIt's the first first-person VR game I've played that hasn't given me sudden motion sickness, and there is even a "cloudwalk" mode that further reduced camera movement for when I felt a bit out of place.","June 5","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
