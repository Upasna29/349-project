Each possible for us to play "race" has own climate. As a Marine it is really part of panic and fear accompanied by elements of horror by exploring the dark corridors filled to the brim with aliens, using a crappy flashlight. A lot of difficult things to do that keep us on the edge. As the Predator, I must admit that at the beginning I had a problem with a huge amount of control, which allowed us to hunt this creature, but it was very rewarding when it started to pretend. And the game as Alien, or so-called Xenomorph was really an interesting experience, walking on the walls, stalking the ventilation shafts, killing groups of people or fight against predators. The graphics in this game is well made, has own charm. I would absolutely recommend this game to everyone regardless of whether you're a fan of the series or not. The only sad thing for me in this game is that such a small number of people playing multiplayer.","October 9, 2014","true","16.7"," 245 of 271 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","245","271","4","1"

However, I feel the game is at least in the higher end of mediocre games, and can produce a lot of fun. At least for fans of the different creatures the game tried (and in my opinion, succeeded) to bring alive.\n\nI am not in a position to review the multiplayer so consider this to be mainly a single player review.\n\nPeople are usually concerned with the duration of gameplay, and what many have said is true, it's short, with the marine campaign being the longest, Predator in the middle and the alien the shortest. It's a shame, as I found that the alien was the most fun, then the predator, and lastly the marine. Though this is not to say that it isn't fun to play the marine, it's just the weakest of the species. All three species campaigns adding up to perhaps 12h, though I might be slow - spending a lot of time in the shadows as an alien, watching how the marines patrol, and cloaked as a predator, deciding which marine to pick off first.\nWhat this game has that the earlier AVP games didn't have, was a more polished experience as the different species:\nAliens feel like more than just a floating camera with floating arms and a tail that shows up every so often. Now you move as your body moves, you can feel with every turn of the camera as your playable xenomorph changes position and sometimes the tail shows up when you turn around fast enough. The way you can leap, look, attack, all are improvements to a first-person-shooter experience of sneaking or leaping and attacking in close quarters, always in the same brutal sense you pick up from the films.\nPredators too feel like they move, behave and look like a predator from the movies. There's nothing like re-enacting a scene so reminiscent from the films: Leap up a tree cloaked, observe the marines below, say you want the smart gunner first, you distract the marine with some distorted human cry, wait for them to get closer, then leap (focus+attack1) on them and pick a trophy.\nAnd that brings me to the full-body awareness. It's a small feature, but I still value it when developers pick up on the little things which can mean a lot to make an experience feel just right. the trophy kills and stealth kills seem to have been the baby of the project to hammer out a smooth way to behave with the character, with little distracting buggy animations, if any at all, just going up to a human and impaling them with your tail, literally, or just stabbing an alien with your wristblades, lifting them up in the air, seeing the dangling xeno giving its last painful shriek, then becoming motionless, and you, the predator, just casting it aside.\nThe story isn't anything new or particularly gripping, but it's okay, and what you could expect, though the AVP2 game had a better story, this game has a better story than the avp movies, so there's that.\nIf only they'd extended the Predator and Alien campaigns, I think the game would have gained more popularity. Also, since the games are trying to be close to the movies, I think it's time to make the "marine" human character female, if you want to copy some of the defining features of the films. Which isn't bad, just saying.\nGraphics do justice to the details of the predators and their swinging dreadlocks, and the shining, slimey aliens, coupled with great animations, which you can admire both while hunting the different species and while playing them, made it a fun experience.\nPersonally the game didn't suffer from issues (and I have a mediocre laptop, win7, intel dual core 2ghz, 4gRAM, graphics card shares its memory with ram, only 64mb dedicated), only a flickering mouse in the mainmenu. I'm mentioning this because I've seen so many games suffer from multiple bugs, though often repairable, this didn't really have any issues for me.\n\nLack of survivor maps as a predator or alien felt like the greatest sorrows of missed opportunities for this game (which I think could have been very feasible additions, as I write in a post on the forums of the game here on steam).","November 25, 2013","true","44.5"," 201 of 217 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","201","217","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/10680/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Aliens vs. Predator is a first-person shooter, released in early 2010 and has almost one million owners on the PC alone. There are three campaigns in this game, one for each character/creature - the Predators, Aliens and Marines. All three of the campaigns have their own individual story line, but all link together in the main story plot.\n\nEach campaign puts you in control of a different race. The Predator is a stealthy, agile race, allowing you to stalk your prey from the tree tops and sneaking around the back of enemies. You also have different vision modes, which will seek out the other races very easily. Each different vision mode however will make the other class invisible. Aliens are able to see through the predators cloaking device while the marines are able to gun down a predator with ease.\n\nAliens, which was by far my favorite race to play as, pushes you to fight in close-quarters with claws, teeth and tails. You have the ability to climb on walls and jump long distances. You can stalk in the shadows and pounce on an unsuspecting enemy.\n\nThe Marine campaign is that far more standard to a first-person shooter. You are able to carry your pistol along with two other firearms, ranging from shotguns to pulse rifles.  To help you work your way around, you are equipped with a torch, flares and motion trackers.\n\nThe graphics are nice; even though this game is a couple of years old now, it still stands the test of time. There are the odd time when you can tell its five years old, but you can't really complain that much as this is easily one of the better looking games from that year. The swamps and forest are lush of greenery, while the alien hives are also very pleasing to look at.\n\nAs with all horror games, the audio in Aliens vs Predator is top notch. Any sudden change in music will get your heart racing, but like all jump scare games, once you start to get used to them and the way they happen, they soon don't effect you at all and are able to just take them in your stride. Once you hit about three quarters of the way through, any horror aspect is lost sadly. Voice acting is very well done here too - all of the main characters are voiced, granted the only campaign with much voice acting is the marines, but you still get bits here and there in the other missions.\n\nI played this on Normal difficulty; and didn't really have any problems - the only one which stands out for me is on the Alien mission when you have to climb through an air tunnel; this took me a while to work out how to progress and had to result to Youtube in the end. Other than that, there are no real hard points to be found, all objectives are clearly marked along with a way-point system arrow that points you in the right direction all of the time.\n\nPlaying all three campaigns on a normal difficulty; I was able to finish Aliens Vs Predator in just under six hours. You can replay the missions on a higher difficulty for an achievement if that is your thing; but once you play it through once, there isn't really any other reason to play it again. The multiplayer scene here is also pretty barren too; so you are really paying just for the single player story.  For me, I am happy with the regular price of £9,99 for this title.\n\nThis is really well put together game, all of the gameplay and story elements are very well presented. It does the franchise justice and fans of the series will love it. I wholeheartedly recommend Aliens vs Predator.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

There is a highly acclaimed Aliens vs Predator game already. This is not a remake of that game, but an all new installment with an original (brief) story.\n\nAliens vs Predator is broken up into three campaigns (it has multiplayer games as well). One campaign you play as the Xenomorph aliens, another you play as the Predator and a third played as a human space marine sent in to combat the two. Each species / character (Predator, Xenomorph, space marine) plays differently. Space marines play like traditional first person shooters, Xenomorphs can climb on the walls and ceilings and use stealth to drop down and kill enemies because they die VERY easily and Predators use a combination of the two. They can jump far distances, stealth kill and change their vision to see in different ways.\n\nAs a space marine, there are a few good and useful weapon types, shotgun, pulse rifle, pistol, flame thrower and more. You can carry three weapons at a time, which feels like enough. Shooting as the space marine feels very imprecise, because you can barely see your crosshairs, the enemies move quick and most of the time, you're shooting at black Xenomorphs on dark walls. The game makes use of light and shadows, because it gives you a flashlight and flares. Both the flashlight and flares are limitless and it felt like there should be sparing usage of both. The flashlight can flicker or go out a few seconds. Your enemy radar can cut out for a moment.\n\nMovement and mouse aim feel clunky, slow and sluggish. At least there is a run button for a few moments of speed when running down straight corridors. Speaking of the run button, a lot of times it feels like I can just run through from the enemies instead of dealing with them.\n\nThere are in your face moments when you need to melee enemies to get them out of your face. Xenomorphs will pounce on you, face huggers will jump in your face, but not so much that it gets annoying like in other games. You even have some cool melee kills that you can use.\n\nEnemy AI and variety is good, Xenomorphs effortlessly crawl everywhere, they can turn in circles on walls, ceilings, nooks, crannies and eves. Face huggers will avoid your crosshairs, Predators will sniper you and even big lumbering android soldiers take some aim to kill. None of the enemies feel particularly deadly or powerful... just difficult to shoot when compared to other games.\n\nThe game sets a great atmosphere that is diverse from section to section. The Xenomorph areas are dark, futuristic and gritty, while the Predator jungles are a foreboding, luscious beauty with a sense of something watching you. The music is good and all background music matches the area.\n\nThe only big gripe is the fact that there are level conclusions. The level ends and you are sent to a screen with your score and where to save or continue. This really breaks immersion especially when the next level takes place the moment the last level ended. This should have been made into a seamless transition with no halt in the action. The score could have been shown on screen, auto saved (which the game does autosave) and keep the action going. Even playing audio logs is cumbersome and could have been done much better instead of having to pause the game... find the audio log and then return to the action. There are better ways to do that without taking yourself out of the action. Apparently there are audio logs (and other tedious collectables), it is a shame that system is so cumbersome that I don't care to listen.\n\nThere are voices in your head telling you what to do, however they don't sound all that believable for the situation you're supposed to be in. It is like they are too pleasant for a situation that has dozens dying. But perhaps having someone barking orders and yelling at you might not be the best to stay focused.\n\nThe objectives are pretty simple and its rinse wash repeat. Go here... clear a wave of enemies... open this door... find the power supply and bring it to a door so you can open it and go through. The level design offers a nice path... going upstairs and downstairs, and weaves around areas, but it is all one way with little chance of getting lost. The game is painfully short with the marine campaign being the longest and taking around 3 hours to complete the first time. It feels more like the campaigns are to teach you everything for multiplayer.\n\nIn conclusion, there are better first person shooters out there more worthy of your time, but if you are a big fan of the franchise, you can pick the game up for $5 or cheaper and have hours of fun with it. I keep thinking of ways this game could have been better, such as more variety with what to do. Sentries you can put up yourself. More friendlies to fight along side. A crouch button to crawl through air ducts. More secrets or exploration, because it feels like the game has zero secrets. More situations that require stealth or thought instead of running to fights or from fights. Light and BRIEF turret and or driving sections (Aliens movie had a driving section). Maybe for the sequel...","February 21, 2015","true","7.0"," 154 of 175 people (88%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","88","154","175","9","0"

Thought Process","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197980884019/","354 products in account","Isolation, vulnerability, dread… Not only does it cover the basic survival-horror elements, it also applies to what made Aliens vs. Predator such an undeniable hit in 1999. Although Rebellion decidedly never attempted to elevate the element of story-telling, providing a coherent plot rather than a series of detached levels, it was the superb level design, terrific environments and effective lightning coupled with relentless dread that reinforced an already satisfied gameplay in a believable setting that through implicit presentation was faithful to the famous movie franchises.\n\nThe sequel by Monolith, however, expanded and surpassed the original by far and the release of Aliens vs. Predator 2 turned out to be one of the best (shooter) games of 2001. The three compelling campaigns that not only took place simultaneously but also intersected at certain points were just as distinguished as the complex underlying structure of the story. Truly capturing the essence of a faithful Alien and Predator movie, the careful attention to detail and coherence against the elegant script was outermost outstanding. The frequent use of engaging voice-overs and excellent music only strengthened the overall impression that Aliens vs. Predator 2 very much unfolded like a great movie. Furthermore, all campaigns were just as terrific and consistent, with the exception of the marine that, by obvious reasons, kept most of the first-rate suspense intact and exceeded the game’s ability.\n\nThe return of Rebellion, however, is questionable regarding inconsistency, gameplay issues and uninspiring plot. Out of three campaigns, one is solid, the second mediocre and the third bad. Since there is a sense of story attached to at least one of them, the marine is the given highlight.  Dark, moody and overall good-looking surroundings, presenting a loyal (yet pretty much recycled) audio direction and amazing music, is a fairly good start. Besides, decently dramatic voice-acting (somewhat ruined by poor dialogue) and a sweet return of veteran actor Lance “Bishop” Henriksen are always considered strength.\n\nThere are a few decent levels of solid tension and the occasional sequences of narrative, but the lack of dread is remarkable and the brutal violence, although spectacularly atrocious to witness, does rarely compensate the absence of fear and substance. The straight forward story of the marine suffers from routine-like clichés without finesse and is mediocre at best, and it only goes downhill in the remaining campaigns. If predator has a less intriguing part except being a pretty much pointless hunter, then the aimless alien is utterly useless.\n\nAlthough not as prominent, mediocrity also applies to a quite linear level design as well as inconsistent AI. Sudden, inexplicable limitations tend to appear in the surroundings for no apparent reason and stagnated civilians prefer to be killed rather than escaping. The mention of awkward controls seems inevitable too. While the marine campaign works fine, the command of both predator and alien feels clumsy and uneven at times, causing unnecessary retries (advising not to play on hard difficulty unless having a great patience…), but being a magnificent creature might suppose to be that harsh.\n\nThe striking brilliance of Monolith’s masterpiece is hardly recaptured in Rebellion’s addition, despite good intention in an actual overall decent presentation. Certainly too much mediocrity and too few substantial shortcomings cannot become as classy and characteristic, but lesser cons ultimately means more pros. And yes, last year’s Aliens: Colonial Marines definitely had more cons than pros.\n\n6,5 / 10","March 4, 2014","true","37.6"," 79 of 90 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","79","90","0","1"

Playing as a Marine was fun but they threw in a weapon that literally had built in aimbot assist, as the Aliens were already fast but could move faster, and Predators who had stealth as well as the ability to kill from a distance so you never really had to go in melee range, although killing both Alien and Marine close range was kind of the point of being a Predator.\n\nIt could had been one of those GotY titles but was lacking. You could just know where the Predator perks spawned and just camped in those places or group hug so Aliens cannot attack, but grouping up against Predator was just a simple job of throwing javelin or mounted laser to kill Marines. So in a way the 3 different types had their strengths as well as weakness.\n\nNice game modes - FFA, Species DM, and personal favorite was Marines vs Predator but not as forgiving as it was a timed game mode so you had to attack and not wait.

Let me tell you what I do think of it\n\n-> PROS\n+The gameplay is very fluent with many sound effects which makes your experience feel that you were there and you were actually fighting those ♥♥♥♥♥es :D\n+The graphics are decent\n+There aren't game breaking bugs :)\n+The multiplayer is just simply awesome. Everyone who says it is dead it is WRONG. Everytime I find like 4 servers full of players. Now, let me tell you the servers slots: 18/18 16/16 12/12 and i think 10/10 (which means that there are like +50 palyers everytime playing which is really good).\n+The stories are well built, especially for the marine. Around 15 hours on your first story completition on Normal difficulty.(Marine+Alien+Predator, so the campaign itself is short).\n+The game itself is complex and it will take some time to master the race you want to play. When you will do that, it will be just awesome.\n+In multiplayer you got ranks. Once you advance in ranks, you get skins.\n+The classes/races are well balanced. Don't think that a predator can easily kill a marine. or opposite. It depends on your skill with every class and the weapons you pickup on the road :) Sometimes it matters the map too. For example , Refinery is a perfect map for an alien.\n+There are many game mods: Deathmatch/Species Deathmatch/Mixed Species Deathmatch , Domination, Infestation, Predator Hunt and Survivor. The DLCs include some survivor maps, so it should be a must buy if you want to play survivor.\n\n-> CONS\n-The game is not recieving support from their developers because the game is old. So do not expect to report a bug and find it fixed. The game will remain as it is.\n- Even though the multiplayer has enough matches to play good, the modes you will find there will be mostly played by the players in the following order: Species DM, Mixed Species DM, Infestation, DM, Predator Hunt. You will surely find servers into these modes. But the rest, much harder. You need some friends if you want to play Domination or something. If you are lucky enough you can join an empty domination or what gamemode you want and someone joines you and then the server will grow in population. Happened that to me a few times\n-Only 5 maps to play. If you want more, you need to get the DLCs too. The problem is, the DLCs maps are not being played. You need friends if you want to play MP on the DLCs maps.\n\n-> CONLUSION\n\nInspite it's cons, the game is mostly perfect. A little of updates in the future and the game will be just fine(even tho this will not happen). Another sad part is that the game is very underrated by many players. Trust me, the game is good.My opinion? Buy this game, but not with the DLCs. If the game is on sale, then buy with the DLCs and find some friends to play with.\nI am strongly recommanding this game to everyone.\n\n-> RATING : 8,5/10","July 21, 2015","true","37.8"," 79 of 91 people (87%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","87","79","91","8","14"

Aliens vs Predator is a solid, polished shooter reminiscent of the original game from 1999, and is guaranteed to thrill and surprise you.\nThe player experiences three different campaigns; predator, alien and marine. Each campaign has a different playing style, and I'm very impressed by the way Rebellion has managed to polish each style so efficiently.\nFirstly, the marine campaign. Probably the best of the three, you use classic weapons from the Alien films and comic books such as the pulse rifle, smartgun and double barrelled shotgun. The shooting is surprisingly tight, and you'll get into a nice rhythm of blasting and reloading. The darker levels are great at creating suspense, and the xenomorph models are beautifully animated. They take you by surprise and can swarm you very quickly, which creates moments of panic that I haven't felt in a shooter for a long, long time. You also fight other enemies like Weyland Yutani androids, who are unsettling in their own way (probably those creepy voice recordings and expressionless faces). You can also experience classic movie moments like blasting the Alien Queen out of her egg sac, which is awesome to just about anyone who has seen Aliens.\nSecondly, the predator campaign. As the Predator, you'll attempt to stay stealthy and pick off enemies using the range of tools at your disposal. You have a plasma caster, a spear, throwing discs and of course, the classic wrist blades. Much like the Batman: Arkham games, you'll navigate high vantage points and isolate enemies with x-ray vision until you are able to safely dispatch them. However, the game will also make you fight Aliens in close combat, which is frustrating and clunky; this consists of repeatedly mashing buttons while aliens continuously leap at you, which makes for a frustrating experience. Also, while the execution animations are quite awesome, they also take a long time to complete and make you vulnerable to damage, which is extremely annoying on harder difficulties.\nFinally, the alien campaign. Playing as the alien also focuses on stealth, and you'll climb over different surfaces while attacking with your claws, teeth and tail. The wall climbing mechanics mostly work, though they can be confusing and hard to use at times. The constant movement of the alien is also quite dizzying, and is especially noticeable when traversing the inside of buildings. Whilst this campaign is still fun in its own right, the confusing wall-climbing and lack of interesting attacks means that this campaign is the least interesting of the three.\nThe game looks fantastic visually, but all three campaigns take place in the same location, so it can get quite repetitive due to the re-used locations. Despite this, it is fun to see where the other species has gone after completing each campaign. For example, when playing as the Predator, there is a level where you find the dead Alien Queen after the Marine segment where you kill the Queen yourself.\nOverall, Aliens vs Predator is an awesome game that doesn't disappoint. The three entertaining campaigns are immensely satisfying, despite odd design choices and irritating game mechanics. 8 / 10","July 31, 2014","true","11.5"," 72 of 81 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","72","81","0","2"

At first it felt a little clunky and cheap but once I got used to the feel of it I found it to be relatively immersive and I ended up enjoying it quite a bit!\n\nThe graphics and audio are reasonable for a 2010 game and they hold up fairly well in my opinion.\n\nThere are 3 single player campaigns: Marine, Predator & Alien.  I played them all in that order and found each one to be unique and entertaining.  I completed all 3 campaigns in 7-8 hours total.\n\nThe game isn't so immersive that you'll force yourself to stay up late playing it but it's definitely worth at least one playthrough through each of the campaigns.  This is an area where the short length of the campaigns may have been a benefit, because if it were any longer it may have become monotonous and tedious to complete.\n\nMarine Campaign\nThe marine campaign was what I was mostly looking for and I was satisfied with it.  You start with a semi-auto pistol with a burst option and an assault rifle that sounds just like the ones from the movies.  Eventually you pick up a pretty sweet shotgun, a heavy machine gun, a flamethrower and a scoped rifle.\n\nPredator Campaign\nThe predator is a lot of fun to play as, definitely overpowered - as it should be.  You get a lot of tactical options here, including stealth, melee attacks, a throwing spear, a 'smart disc', proximity mines and of course the shoulder cannon.  You can even use auditory distractions to lure marines, just like in the movies.  There is also a very cool and intuitive method for making huge leaps from location to location and 3 different vision modes you can cycle through to better see humans or aliens.\n\nAlien Campaign\nI really didn't know what to expect from the alien campaign but was pleasantly surprised with how unique it was.  You can walk/run on just about any surface and move through ducts.  As an alternative to executing enemies, you can harvest them which means you hold them down while a facehugger comes out of nowhere and latches onto their face.  The NPC's reactions when you do this are pretty unnerving honestly, and each time I did it kind of made me a little sick.  You can also hiss to lure enemies closer, or just because.\n\nMultiplayer\nI have not tried multiplayer - I would if there were a pure coop mode vs AI.","February 14, 2015","true","8.1"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","33","36","0","0"

In gaming however they really worked! Starting back in the Arcade as a “Final Fight” style beat-em up, the Atari Jaguar in 1994, the PC version in 2000, and a sequel in 2004. All were fun games for their time. So how does the latest in the series hold up? Well it helps if your a fan of Alien, and The Predator movies, and I am so my review may be biased. The game is broken into three campaigns that tie in the main story. Players can choose a Colonial Marine, the Alien, or The Predator. Each class plays very unique with their own abilities. The Marine campaign was my favorite, it captures some of the Aliens feel. There is a great line-up of movie weapons, tense scenes, and a lot of action. My complaints for the Marine are minor. I really wish they added “Aim Down Sites”. Firing from the hip in gaming is just old school, I need my sites! Second complaint is the motion tracker, It's all but useless in the game. I know I'll get some heat for saying this, but Aliens Colonial Marines made far better use of the motion tracker.  My second favorite campaign was The Predator. With all of his tools at your disposal, you will feel like an unstoppable hunter. My only complaint on The Predator is the “pred jump”. At times it can be a pain to line up, but once you know the map its less frustrating. The Aliens campaign was my least favorite. The Alien can transition to walls, and run in 3D. It has some interesting fatalities, and is extremely fast. However This is extremely disorientating in first person view, and I can't tell you how many times I ran right by an enemy because of the speed the Alien runs at. This could have been easily fixed if the Alien had 3rd person perspective. The game offers a decent amount of multiplayer modes, and a decent number of maps. The only thing I wish is there was a little more variety in the scenery. Your either in a Jungle, or a pyramid, and that’s about it.  The game will run on almost any PC if you adjust the resolution, and graphics options (Not your Apple II, but anything from 2010 and up should be fine). Overall this game despite its flaws is a very fun play, and I recommend it. If you've been passing on this one, and your a fan of either franchise you should pick it up. You can typically find it during a Steam sale for $5\n\nOLDER GAMER APPROVED  POTATO PC CERTIFIED\nVisit our Currator Page","December 30, 2015","true","57.0"," 42 of 51 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","42","51","5","8"

You can play as 3 characters/classes: Predator and Alien obviously, but also marine, here is their playstyles.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPredator: Think of him as a strategic hunter, you have a choice of 4 weapons that are scatted around the area, he also has 3 visions:Normal, Alien, and Thermal. Alien helps you see aliens which will be highlighted in Green, and thermal helps catch other Predators, but here are his list of weapons:\n1. Plasma Caster, a weapon that tracks down your target almost like an aimbot, but it's easy to avoid as an Alien.\n2.Smart Disc, a projectile you can control, 1 hits Aliens if it hits their head. Also stuns.\n3. Spear, a  projectile that while is hard to hit is a 1 hit kill guaranteed.\n4. Mines, as the name implies, THEY'RE MINES. If you can track your enemies movement patterns, you can lay these in areas they might go in. As they are hard to see unless you are another Predator.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlien: He is hard to see in the Dark and his tail whips are a vicious weapon, especially if used on the walls. With Alien, you want to stay on the walls as much as possible, never stop moving either since this makes you an easy target, as Aliens have extremely low health, but high kill potential. The Aliens best move would be his Heavy attack since it stuns longer than the predators does. Aliens can't fight Predators alone, that is a death wish, get another Alien pal to help you take one down, similar to the movies, they like to swarm instead of attack alone, like ants or bees.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMarine: If you want to be under constant pressure of hearing Aliens growling and Predators roaring... Marine is for you!\nBut in all honesty, Marine is quite good if you can use him right, he of course uses guns to fight, so here are some of his guns:\nPistol: Unlimited Ammo, but very little damage. You most likely will not want to use this.\nPulse Rifle:A good, all around weapon.\nShotgun:If you like to get in an Alien or Predators face, you can use the shotgun, it's buckshot is extremely powerful and it stuns.\nFlamethrower:Not used very much, pouring Gasoline can help do extra damage.\nSniper Rifle: Almost an insta-kill if headshots, very good.\nSmart Gun: Can track enemies through walls, has an Aimbot, reduces your weapon slots and speed though.Bad if you are trapped by them, mainly because it can only focus one at a time. But good if you are trying to deal with one at a time.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWell, that is all I got, this a very fun game I think that should be revived. The graphics are very good, and the gameplay feels nice.

Let us hope that my predecessor's faith in it was justified."\n\nThe AVP series returns! AVP 2(Which isnt even on steam!!) was released a whopping 9 years before this game! Thats definetely too long to be waiting!.\nAnyway this game's main strong point in SP is that you have 3 campaigns to play (much like the earlier games.) Obviously you have the Path of the Predator , Alien and the Weakest of them all...Marine\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=595587281\nThis game gets lots "correct" as expected, but most are already standard this kind of series but many gameplay mechanics and controls are awkward and there are many imbalances in Multiplayer unfortunetely. But ill cover all that in the Pros and Cons below.\n\nPros:+Campaigns (15 hours on average)\n+Many Collectibles to read (Backstry\n+Hot Corporal xD\n+Interesting Story for the Marine and the Predator that show very unique motivations!\n+Amazing Multiplayer Modes! The three Species really combine for some real chaos! (Across 7 Gamemodes!)\n+Weapons are Creative and have different "Classes" for each species too.\n+A new Planet (BG-386) with about 6 Large Environments to explore. These Maps are "recreated" slightly for multiplayer but the unique feel that each one brings still remains.\n+Soundtrack and General Sound clarity (Especially for the "Rookie" Marine). This mixed with the environments really help immersive the player! (Some examples of great sound effects being used include: Rocks Crumbling in the Pyramid and Ruins, Frogs, Birds and even other-worldy creatures make their calls and even Noisy Dust Storms on Barren Areas of the Surface.\n+General Mechanics are very unique for each species. Some Examples include: Blood Stained Motion-Tracker HUD for the Marine, Simplified but Advanced Predator HUD with Special Symbols representing Health, Energy and even 4 View-Modes (Including the Infamous infra-Red/ Marine-Doom Vision). The Predator HUD is especially awesome though because its like an ancient language native to the species with very few icons/symbols on-screen at once, power and health only show when they are affected but the Environment/Enemies.\n+Alien Traversal- Climb Everywhere! Maybe...Behind you\n+Predator Traversal- "Jumpin, Jimmies! Hes fast.."\n+Very Gory for players who like that sort of thing (I know i do ;D)\n+Finishers in Multiplayer are amazingly creative and is more than equivalent to backstabbing someone in COD (Thats why its special!) A Short-scene will play showing the Gory finish and aftermath of the enemy you just dominated! (Similar to DooM 4...in a Way)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=680056038\nCons:-The majority of maps are boring and lack interesting Features in Multiplayer. For Example, there are no items to interact with, no environmental traps or danger zones, and ZERO Light adjustments when in very dark areas! (Marine's sh*tty flashlight isnt going to do anything!!)\n-Marine is so underpowered compared with the Predator, but more even when compared with the Aliens abilites. (Motion tracker was made for the Xenos!)\n-Story is so short for each species. Although decent, its lacking in any effort to make the player really care for/trust/love/despise/ interested about. There are about 5 characters in the Marine story that i was interested in. Especially after reading the Logs. But Many Marine Grunts, Allies and even the main Antagonist (Lack of history about them when playing..have to rely on more logs to really understand their intentions.) Make a noticeably small impact on players. Of course this is an Action FPS but more connection with fellow squad members would be very interesting (something that Colonial Marines has instead!?)\n-Speaking of Marine Grunts, the Voice Acting is repetitive and unimportant "obvious" commands can easily be ignored/misheard due to the proximity you need to be.. :(\n-The Graphics are Terrible for a Game of its Reputation and time period! at 2000 and 2001 it didnt really matter about that sort of thing, but this isn't good at all!\nIt definetely not grainy, but instead it very glossy/reflective and doesnt handle darkness well at all. This is good for the Predator and the Alien, but once again the Marine comes off worse!\n-Alien Campaign's Plot and Levels is very predictable, crawl here, escape from here, harvest those people, etc. least interesting story of the 3 but the ending is very good :D\n-The Marine movements are slow and clearly Flawed when compared with the other enemies. It also suffers some painfully Bad Controls (and LACK of some controls) such as: he runs out of breath after 5 seconds of running, no crouching of prone, no ADS or Iron-Sights and he even jumps a whopping 5 centimetres in the air!\n-Multiplayer unlocks (Rewards for HARD WORK)are bland and the alien skins are Very Similar, out of the 3 species youd expect the natural predator with elite organic claws and fangs to have the most variation! But only 2 of the Alien Skins really stand out (Out of 6)\n-Unfortuntely there isnt enough maps to go with the large ammount of gamemodes! (It should be reversed!!)\n-Speaking of Multiplayer, It has Died a Pitiful, Lonely Life..\n-The Lack of intereactive elements in levels, especially in multiplayer! this is not good for the marine, who could really use a sentry unit to set-up and assist them!\nOr a Crusher door which could trap and Squish the enemies!\n-Marine Ending wasnt as good as it could have been.. The Endings of the Xeno and The Pred were much more satisfying!! Although the Marine is much easier to learn to control than the others (Maybe Because hes just a human?)\n-Lots of Visual Effects (eg:Explosions) on screen can cause freezing or some noticeable frame rate drops.\n-The Alien Controls are VERY sensitive and irregular for your average FPS Player, Finish the Story before trying out The Cute little Xenos in MP.\n\nLots to Understand obviously when it comes to this game. SP and MP are Seperate realms really. Overall I'd say this game tries too hard to give a generic action-guns-blazing kind of feel (Inspired by Aliens?) But i would have prefered the Marine to focus on horror and a deep storyline that involved a Corporation sized Evil. I would have prefered the Alien Plot to Follow some kind of hive-Growth or exploration for a new colony! With Co-op Partners even (I know its asking lots) to help harvest the masses! I thought that Predator Plot was actually very Good! Once you get the hang of all their controls (Takes the Longest time to master.) The Parts of it that really stood out to me included: Finding an ancient artifact, destroying an Lethal abomination that the Predators themselves Bred and all while growing from a Training Young Wolf into a Lord!-(Pred-Ranks)\nThis game in SP i found  interesting but each campaign was obviously cut short due to storage space and developing time. Not Good!\nThis game in MP i find lacks many crucial Features/Physics/Gameplay Options of an Standard FPS, but this is AVP...with 3 different Species to choose from, (Let alone characters..) so ill let it off with a warning this time.\n\nI Rate SP- 7/10 (Predator has the most unique Plot)\nI Rate MP- 6/10 (Lack of Maps and Weapon-Balancing ruins the good chance it had promised.)\n\nSo Overall that is a 6.5/10 if you want to be Specific!\nSo buy this in a Sale...but Good luck finding Matches in MP!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajpos/recommended/10680/","ajpos","Andy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajpos/","483 products in account","Aliens vs. Predator is a reboot of the extremely successful Aliens vs. Predator PC-game franchise, whose only 2 releases were in 1999 and 2001.  The 2010 release is made by the same team as the originals and features much of the same gameplay and features. I played through the Predator campaign and tried some of the Alien and Marine levels for my first impressions.\n\nThe Good:\n\n* This game features three separate campaigns, each with completely different control schemes and game mechanics. Although they are all FPS-action, the similarities between the three campaigns sort of end there. The Marine campaign plays a lot like a horror FPS game, you are stuck in dark hallways with a flashlight and loads of weaponry. The predator game is a bit more stealth & platform-based: the predator campaign gives you control of a character with super jumping power, the ability to go semi-invisible, and the ability to perform stealth takedowns. Finally, the alien campaign allows your character to walk on walls and ceilings, run extremely quickly, and also regenerate health over time. The alien campaign also features stealth elements but has a remarkably different feel from any other FPS game due to your avatar's low viewing position and extremely fast speed.\n\n* The jumping mechanics for the predator are excellent: fun and intuitive. The game is fair in its level design regarding the implementation of a playable character that has super-human jumping abilities.\n\n* The game's plot is interwoven across all 3 campaigns. You can experience the same story from 3 different perspectives.\n\n* Great "kill" animations, but there are too few of them.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\n* Field-of-view is locked at around 70 degrees or so. Not the worst, but annoying.\n\n* Inconsistent graphical quality. Some things look amazing, other times I felt like I was playing a Half-Life mod.\n\n* The predator gameplay, which I was most looking forward to, is lackluster. The stealth technology hardly seems to work on the Marines, and it does not work at all vs. Aliens.\n\n* Melee combat never really does well in FPS games, and 2/3rds of this game is melee combat. The developers needed some sort of gimmick or game mechanic to make the combat interesting, rather than just repeatedly mashing down the LMB.\n\n\n* The auto-save checkpoints don't work if you're trying to play all three campaigns at the same time. For example, your savegame in the predator campaign will get overwritten if you try to go play the marine campaign. This problem can be fixed by manually saving your game, or restarting levels from the very beginning.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\n* The single-player game is essentially three long hallways with objectives clearly pointed out for the player with plenty of hand-holding. I am getting sick of games like that.\n\n* The wall-climbing aspect of the alien is unintuitive and seems to only work half the time. Rather than giving me a button to click to go on a wall, my character should just automatically start climbing it. But that is not the worst part: the game puts in things like computer banks and bookcases against walls to purposefully restrict you from using certain walls. It is incredibly annoying that a super powerful alien can decimate an entire spaceship of marines but cannot climb on walls that happen to have computer banks at the bottom of them.\n\n* Multiplayer, which is supposed to be a large chunk of the game's playability, is completely dead.\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nAlthough Aliens vs. Predator is a solid FPS with some innovative game mechanics, it does little to enhance gaming as a whole. The game will not be remembered five years from now and will most likely never make it onto anyone's top 10 list for anything. But the game is a fun diversion worth checking out if you can find the game on a deep sale. However, I don't think you will make it through any of the campgaigns before getting bored so I cannot recommend it.","January 20, 2014","false","2.1"," 56 of 88 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","56","88","4","3"

Whilst you must keep an eye on your motion tracker it's hard to do so when you are aiming at an alien on the ceiling and can hear the Predator laughing at you and get attacked from behind.\nYou start out in an industrial complex and the feel and tone of the game are much like Doom 3 as it's very dark and you must rely on your torch (or flashlight if you will) although there are some larger inside and outside areas. The game breaks you in gently with movement showing up on your motion scanner but not actually appearing whilst you get accustomed to your range of movement and controls which are standard FPS controls. The sounds are awesome though. A lot of work has been done in this area and all the sound effects from the films are there.\nThe story for each race is fairly short; the Marine probably gets the most out of it all, followed by the Predator & Alien. Each race also plays quite differently due to their differing abilities. The Alien is fast but surprisingly fragile - you must be stealthy at all times; the Marine relies on ranged weapons while the Predator & Alien mostly need to get in close, and so on. All in all, it's an interesting mix and the differences in the storyline are played out quite well. There's also a decent selection of multiplayer modes for all species and a wave-after-wave "survival" mode for the Marine.\n","October 19, 2015","true","10.1"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","19","23","0","0"

It took me not much more than 3 hours to finish each of their own stories on the Normal difficulty without looking for every collectible the game has to offer. Considering it’s a game from 2010 I was really satisfied with the visuals. The forests look dense and the water looks crystal clear. Light and shadow look good considering it’s been awhile since the game was released. If you are an Alien movie fan from the very first movie when it was released in 1979 by Ridley Scott then you may find more enjoyment in Aliens VS Predator then, say, in Aliens: Colonial Marines.\n\nThe Marine Story was the first one I experienced and among your typical FPS shooting action and objectives, I managed to find some tense moments where light could be as useful as bullets. Setting a proper mood when playing can improve your experience quite a bit so a darker room with some sort of surround headphones can be a big changer. Some of the weapons were accurate when portraying the sound from the original movies, yet, there were many times I felt overpowered against such terrifying enemy.\n\nThe predator Story was my favorite from the three. Right from the start, as predator, you will have to proof you are worth to join the most elite soldiers. Hunting and stealth tactics will be your best weapon. Divide to conquer is the best strategy one can find while trying to get your precious human trophies. Some may find an extreme satisfaction by taking their time to caught the enemies by surprise while finishing them off with a decapitation while others may prefer a more direct, ruthless approach. It’s up to you how you play, just remember that it’s a good idea to adapt as you play different species.\n\nPlaying the Alien story was the most hard for me. While it took me some time to get used to the controls by climbing the ceiling, walls and so on these missions gave me some harsh motion sickness, turning the experience really different and less enjoyable from the other two. After (if) you get used to the fast walking and crawling between walls, floors and ceilings you will feel the horror is about to arrive to those poor Marines. Waiting and stalking the prey when they less expect feels amazing and I found myself to avoid killing all the soldiers if it was not required. The notion of panic from the Marine soldiers is well noted and if you are spotted they will try to find you and terminate you, hence why it makes such a difference to wait in order to deal the final blow to the enemy.\n\nIn the end I had great fun with the game and I still believe it holds up in this time and day. If you are an Alien or Predator fan I’m sure you already played this game, if not, I think it deserves a good chance, for the right price. The Online portion of the game may be absent considering nobody still plays by now but either way the three different campaigns remains a solid experience that may be worth your attention and also your time.\n","September 20, 2014","true","8.2"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","20","26","0","0"

This means variety as you switch between the three between missions and each have there different abilities and weapons with the Predator particularly having the best mix of weapons including laser, mines, disc and spear.\n- The marine single player was my favourite, only for the reason that it felt great looking desperately around for Aliens crawling around the walls in the darkness.\n- Animations, they get repetitive but they look great.\n- Being able to launch in DirectX11 means that even today the game looks pretty good.\n- Collectables, if you get really into it theres plenty of things to look for in each story.\n- The arena fights between the three enemies are pretty fun and there are a couple of decent boss like battles, the one as you play as the Predator against the Queen stands out.\n- Sound in this game is superb, the calls of the Aliens/Predators, the sound of your rifle and the bleep of your radar.\n\nCONS:\n- Whilst the 3 stories are parallel the plot is pretty rubbish, I didn't care for it as I was only in for the action and whilst each have there own little endings the environments you reach in stages depend on the timings you play the stories, this means the environments run the risk of being repetitive.\n- Lack of Marine weapons, there aren't enough and the flamethrower will end up killing you more often than your enemies. No grenades either? Stupid!\n- Androids, they're tough. Harder to kill than the Alien and even the Predator, a shotgun is there only real weakness.\n- Alien controls are clunky at times, transition between walls leaves you lost and there aren't really enough types of attack.\n\n\nVERDICT?\nBy no means the most polished game, nor the best single player but it offers something a bit different and lots of variety in the 3 game styles and a brilliant multiplayer on dedicated servers *cheers wellen1981","July 16, 2015","true","18.1"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","16","19","2","10"

This AVP might not be as good as some of the classic AVP games, but I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed the three single player campaigns when I played them all the way through on Xbox.  The single player is pretty good, an opinion not shared by many people.  As mentioned above there are three campaigns, one for Predators, one for Marines, and one for Xenomorphs. Each is a different length and the play style for each character is radically different.\n\nThe biggest issue with the game, at least in my opinion is the multiplayer. The single hit executions are all fine and dandy in the single player game mode, but they quickly become boring and just generally un-fun in multiplayer. You end up spawning and dying multiple times a minute from all these insti kill attacks. Another issue is that the melee, a huge part of the game for the two alien races is generally terrible. There is a ton of stun spam, and while there are ways to break out of this you die so fast (from insti-kill button prompt attacks) that to me makes the multiplayer feel not even worth it. Couple that with the low player base and the cheaters and I just dont know what to say.  There are indeed cheaters though, speed hacks and all sorts of stuff along those lines.\n\nPerhaps my experience with the PC version of multiplayer AVP is abnormal, I dont know. what I do know is that after playing a bunch hours I was completely prepared to never come back to multiplayer in this game.  I still recommend the single player though to anyone looking for a new AVP game! But I would hope you waited for a sale and bought this super cheap.  Overall I probably forgot to touch on some of the more important parts of the game, I still hope this will do as an acceptable review for now.","January 8, 2015","true","14.5"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","21","29","2","0"

Good, here's your solution.  Aliens VS. Predator is straightforward.  There are Aliens, there are Predators, there are Marines, go nuts ♥♥♥♥ everything.  Graphically it's not that impressive, sound design is alright.\n\nThe game's campaign is split in three.  Theres an Alien Campaign, Predator Campaign, and a Human Campaign.\n\nThe Alien Campaign is alright.  Gameplay is average, you run around on walls and can drop down and attack people.  Enemies are highlighted.  It plays a bit like a stealth game.  Since the Alien doesn't have alot of Health you have to sneak around.  You can destroy lighting to hide yourself better, and you have to rely on speed to catch up with your target.  The story for the Alien Campaign however is predictably weak, and gets really repetitive after awhile.  Problem is, there's no Predators featured at all until the final level's Boss Fight.  It's an Aliens VS. Predator game with no Predator fighting in the Alien Campaign.  AI tends to be a bit dumb at times too, which makes it even more dull and mundane.\n\nThe Predator Campaign is probably the best part of the game.  Predator has thermal vision and stuff that highlights enemies, and can cloak and run around and has all the cool Predator weapons.  The Predator Campaign is the only campaign that prominently features all the factions as enemies.  You fight a mix of Humans and Aliens.  AI is still a bit dumb.  The Predator also had the best final boss in the game.  Fighting it was an absolute blast.  Story here is once again a bit weak.\n\nThe Human Campaign is a semi-generic FPS with Colonial Marine gear.  There are different weapons and you shoot things with them.  You run out of ammo really quickly so you have to actually be careful and time your shots well.  This can be tricky though because you'll panic.  Alot.  This game manages to make you afraid alot.  The Aliens although still a bit dumb, are far more intelligent and threatening than the ones in say, Colonial Marines.  They're also alot tougher and a prolonged encounter with them gets really tense.  The game doesn't quite stay as true to the asthetic and gear of the Marines used in Aliens, but it's still entertaining.  My biggest problem is once again, the lack of any actual Aliens VS. Predator here.  Most of the game you spend fighting Aliens or Androids.  There's a brief segment where you fight a Predator about halfway through, but with the buildup of the Predator's appearance in the Human Campaign, you'd expect more.  Story is absurdly weak and predictable, even though the Human Campaign should have the best storytelling potential.\n\nAll of the events of these campaigns take place concurrently.  While it's a neat narrative idea, the story in each campaign is still weak and linking them all together doesn't help it in anyway, and TBH it feels like a lazy excuse for the dev to recycle the same levels for the different campaigns, which it does to the point of frustration.  Each faction also gets hyper gory execution animations, which are done very well and certainly earn that M Rating.\n\nNot even going to talk about Multiplayer, which is mostly dead.  Anyone still playing is either a hacker or someone who just bought the game and will be gone soon.\n\nOverall, a seriously flawed game, but still better than most Alien games on the market.\n\n5/10, buy it on sale only if you're a fan of the franchise.","June 16, 2015","true","5.9"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

As the multiplayer is pretty much dead you'd be paying £10 for the three in game campaigns, and having beaten all three atleast twice (including on nightmare) I can say its worth it.\n\nThis entry does a much better job at getting the feel of the marine (and how slow and sluggish he is), the predator (and his overpowering strength & impressive agility) and especially the alien, getting just how nimble and agile these creatures are. Xenomorphs can easily transition between walls and ceilings, harvest humans with facehuggers, pounce unsuspected enemies from the dark and even destroy lights to make your job easier. The alien also has regenerating health, which is something I missed in the other two games (because xenomorphs don't need to feed, they survive on their blood alone).\n\nThough if bug hunting, facehugging and trophy collecting isnt your thing, I recommend Alien: Isolation, as it swaps out the action for horror.","November 18, 2015","true","33.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","9","9","2","0"

Predator also have different vision modes, which will seek out the other races very easily. Predator cuts the head of the Marine then they collect it.\n\nMarine have radars to detect stealth predator but runs out of ammo really quickly.

Compared with ACM (2013).\nMade by Rebellion\nReleased in 2010\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSpoilers ahead.\n\nAliens vs Predator is the latest AvP title from Rebellion. The first game was AVP (1999).\nThe second was developed by Monolith and realised in 2001. The first version was improved (AvP gold) and can be purchased at steam. AvP 3 was released on february 19, 2010 in Europe and features three distinct story lines. You can play as Alien, Predator or Marine. It has no connection to the AvP films other that it features three characters and some familiar organisations like Weyland - Yutani.\n\n(tip: before you play this game, you should have seen the Alien films and/or played other Alien related games)\n\nStory and gameplay\nThe story is mediocre. But it offers unique perspectives on the Alien and Predator franchises. Weyland - Yutani is the main 'villain' in this game. This game let you play as Alien, Predator or Human.\n\n- Compared with the story off ACM, this story is not quite as good. Because it has no connection to the films. ACM is better in this regard.\n\nThe Alien is nicknamed 'Number 6' and you will try to escape the facility and return to your queen. In the end you must fight the Predator.\n\nThe Predator is nicknamed 'Dark' and you will try to obtain a weapon that the marines captured. In the end you must fight the Predalien.\n\nThe Marine is nicknamed 'Rookie' and you will try to unravel the secrets of Weyland - Yutani and fight deadly Aliens. In the end you fight with Mr. Weyland.\n\nThe Alien campaign is the shortest. Crawling against walls and objects can be a bit difficult. You have no longe range weapons. You are the weapon. You can perform fatality moves with the 'E' button just like the Predator. You see with a 'fish - eye' perspective. The Alien can crawl into vents and airducts.\n\nThe Predator campaign offers high - tech weaponary and is quite entertaining. You can perform fatality moves just like the Alien. You cannot crawl but you jump from tree to tree. You have the ability to cloak yourself. With your helmet you can view in three 'modes'.\n\nThe Marine or human campaign is the longest. It is the standard FPS genre. You have weapons and you have a flaslight to illuminate dark areas. You are the 'soft' character, compared to Alien and Predator.\n\n- Compared with ACM, the campaigns are original and fresh. You can play different characters. AVP is better in singleplayer aspect. ACM does offer co - op campaign unlike AVP.\n\nArtifical Intelligence\nThe A.I. of the game is very good. You can set your difficulty and the enemies will become tougher. If you play on the highest setting: only for die hards.\n\n- Compared with ACM, its a tie (difficulty settings).\n\nMultiplayer\nIf you play multiplayer, you will play team deathmatch. It offers the three main characters in a brutal war against each other. You can also play other modes like survival in which you fight waves of enemies. Just like other games (Left for Dead for example).\n\n- Compared with ACM, multiplayer is quite the same. It offers less modes but you can play as more characters.\n\nIn-game bugs and screen tearing in singleplayer and multiplayer.\nThere are no bugs - except the Aliens themselves - in this game.\n\n- Compared with ACM, there are no bugs or screen tearing. AVP is better.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics of this game are really good. If you compare this game to A:CM, AVP offers much more detail. With DX11 you will enjoy high end graphics. If you have a good pc you can play this game with maximum settings. Humans, Aliens and Predators look very good. Facial expressions are good. Lightning effects and environments are exceptional detailed. AVP is the best looking Alien game until now.\n\n- The graphics of AVP are much better then ACM graphics if you focus on detail. But ACM offers an 80's setting. If you like detail go for AVP. If you like 'old school' style and resemblance to Aliens (1986), go for ACM. All in all, AVP offers superb graphics.\n\nSound\nThe sound of this game is really good. The Alien and Predator sounds are very good. But if you compare the sound of the weapons in this game with the weapons in Alien,  Predator or AVP movies, they are not the same. ACM offers better sounds.\n\n- If you compare the sound of this game to ACM, both are quite good. Although I prefer the sound of ACM weaponary. The sounds of the Alien in AVP are very good. Sounds of both games are good.\n\nReplayability\nReplayability of the game is high because of the three distinct campaigns and the multiplayer options. It offers no co - op mode like ACM.\n\n- Both AVP and ACM offer high replayability if you are Alien fan like me. ACM offers co - op unlike AVP and more multiplayer modes. ACM wins.\n\nConclusion\nAVP 3 from 2010 is a game that delivers the AVP universe in a fresh setting. Because it offers unique campaigns, you will play this game again. The graphics of this game are unique. Much better then ACM graphics. They are not so good like Crysis 3 for example, but they are still very good. The story of the game is mediocre. The latest installment of the AVP series offers superb graphics and animations, a mediocre story, good sounds, three distinct playable characters and fun multiplayer modes.\n\nAVP has better graphics then ACM, three campaigns with different characters and fun multiplayer modes. It is not movie related but it offers a decent story.\n\nAll in all, AVP is not as good as ACM. Co - op, upgradable weapons and better multiplayer modes and DLC belong to ACM.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe good\n* Based on a existing franchise;\n* Very good graphics;\n* Three distinct stories;\n* Multiplayer and survival mode are very good;\n* Fresh and innovative gameplay.\n\nThe bad\n* No co - op modes;\n* No upgradable weapons;\n* Less multiplayer modes compared to ACM.\n* No canon story.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: 7.5 out of 10.","April 22, 2014","true","350.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Everybody who likes a mix of horror and action should play Aliens vs Predator.Given the garbage most fans have had to go through in recent years, including one luke-warm Aliens vs Predator movie, this is a welcome addition to the series.The controls for Predators and Xenomorphs may be a bit tricky and the AI sometimes doesn't show any "Intelligence" at all, but nevertheless: AvP is a must-have for fans of the movies, as well as the games - especially if you're into absolute multiplayer-mayhem and dont mind "some" gore.Overall Aliens Vs Predator has succeeded in bringing to the table so much newness with an old concept. It just does not get old anytime soon in it's playability.","March 5, 2014","true","32.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

I even had issue 0, I can safely say that this is the last semi-decent thing made in the franchise(EDIT: I have not played Alien Isolation). But... there are no surprises here and some huge disappointments. If you like to be scared, the human single player campaign has it's moments. If you are interested in the single player, give it a go. I think it's worth the money--if it's on sale. This was the game, by the way, that introduced me to Steam since it required a Steam account to play. Whether or not that's a good thing, I'll leave for you to decide. I never finished the campaign, however, because I just didn't find it that compelling. If you like the franchise a lot and for some reason haven't yet tried this game, maybe you should see what it has to offer yourself the next time it goes on sale.\n\nThe reason I stopped playing, and my greatest cause for hesitation in recommending this title, is that the multiplayer is broken in terms of balance. When playing online, my typical experience as a player attempting to play as an alien would be that a few predators would essentially wipe the map clean in no time. Again and again. In order for the alien game to work in multiplayer, you have to have a well-coordinated team working together, like in the comics and movies. Otherwise you get what you have in the mp games online--too many predators, not enough aliens, or even marines. Also, I don't usually whine about cheats and hacks, but I have some concerns because of the (albeit limited) interactions I experienced online. If you have a large group of friends or a clan, this could be a lot of fun with clear limits set forth on how many players per species to keep things balanced and in proper ratio. So, with those concerns stated, If you like this franchise, give it a go if you don't think you'll mind the problems I've stated here. One more thing, the last few times I played online it seemed that the mp community was dying, probably for some of the very same reasons I've mentioned here. So you may or may not have much chance to experience online play depending upon the current state of that aspect of the game.","March 13, 2014","true","41.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Go to Multiplayer—Player Match—Browse Games, then change the Server Type to Dedicated (Internet) and press Browse. There are normally about 20 to 30 players on. Sometimes more, sometimes less.\nWith that being said, the multiplayer is pretty fun. There are a total of 7 game modes: Death Match, Species Team DM, Mixed Species DM, Predator Hunt, Infestation, Domination, and Survivor.\nDeath Match\nThis game mode is your standard free-for-all death match, where your devotion to your species does not matter.\nSpecies Team DM\nThis game mode is similar to Death Match, but has 3 teams. Whatever species you select, either it be Alien, Predator, or marine, that will be the team that you fall into.\nMixed Species DM\nLike Species Team DM, this death match mode has teams, though you pick what team you fall into. This means you can have an Alien, Predator, and a marine on the same team.\nPredator Hunt\nThis mode, everyone starts as a marine, except for one randomly selected Predator. The Predator's job is to kill as many marines as possible in a short time limit. As the Predator does so, its time limit is increased and its score is as well. The marine's job is to kill the Predator. The only way to become the Predator is to either kill it, or have it run out of time and then another marine is randomly selected to become the Predator. At the end, whoever has the most points as Predator, wins.\nInfestation\nEveryone starts as a marine except one Alien who's selected at random. The Alien's job is to kill the marines. Once a marine is killed, they turn into an Alien. The game ends once every marine has been killed and turned into an Alien.\nDomination\nIn this mode, you play either as marines or Aliens. Your goal is to capture and defend as many Control Points as possible. You gain points based on how many Control Points you have and how long you keep them. The victor is whoever reaches the score limit, or have the most points once the time has run out.\nSurvivor\nWith up to 4 players, you and your team play as marines fighting a never ending swarm of AI controlled Aliens. With each wave you survive, the next wave throws more and different varieties of Aliens at you. The game ends once all marines are dead. This mode can also be played solo.\nNOTE: the only game modes that seem to be played online, is mainly Species Team DM and occasionally Death Match.\nCampaign	There are 3 campaigns for Aliens vs. Predator. There is marine, Predator, and Alien.\nMarine\nNot much to say, seems like your average first-person shooter, except with far more horror and suspense. You face dark, claustrophobic environments with only a flashlight and a flare to guide you. The guns feel good, and the controls feel solid.\nPredator\nPredator campaign has a real merit to it. You focus on eliminating marines and Aliens (obviously) using your weapon of choice. As you proceed through the levels, you gain more weapons to use, such as the Plasma Caster or the wrist blades. The jumping mechanism feels sturdy; easy to use and very handy. Overall, the controls are solid. The executions are gruesome, gory, and very fun to pull off. However, the fact that you cannot cancel the execution halfway through baffles me. If you are getting shot at by a marine or hit by an Alien, you can't cancel executions. This isn't game breaking, but can be annoying. This is also applies to Alien.\nAlien\nThe Alien hides in the shadows, eliminating it's targets (mainly marines) using stealth. Like the Predator, Alien executions are gruesome, if not more gruesome, but cannot be cancelled. Regardless, they are still fun to pull off. The controls for Alien feel clunky. Once you get used to them, they aren't too bad. Climbing onto walls can take a moment and camera angles, when moving on walls, are simply weird. Jumping onto walls is often easier than climbing, but despite the controls, the Alien campaign is definitely the weakest. Not bad, but not great.\nVerdict	Aliens vs. Predator is an action first-person shooter, with aspects of horror. The single player is a great experience and the executions are just brutal. Multiplayer is also quite fun, despite the low amount of players. However, finding a packed server is often easy. Overall Aliens vs. Predator is a great game, and well worth it.","November 21, 2015","true","70.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

Some parts where you are fighting off swarms of enemies is pretty nerve-wracking. The boss fights against larger aliens and then predators are also well done. There's a decent selection of weapons and nice changes of locations (jungles, bases, the pyramid).\n\nI found the alien campaign less interesting. You have to focus on stealth and wait to pick off individuals who are alone as you can't take many gunshots.\n\nThe predator campaign was my favourite. Although you have less weapons than in the marine campaign they are much more fun.\n\nOverall I'd give this a 7 out of 10- well worth buying for $5 or so when on sale.","May 5","true","12.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

You are considerably more vulnerable than the previous games and you have to be careful not to get killed because the Marines have a lot of firepower, you have to rely on stealth and speed more than brute aggression.\nThe Marine campaign is pretty immersive, although in some points it gets too tough, particularly in the temple bridge part where you have to keep at bay a huge wave of aliens and two praetorians and you're slow as a turtle and the sentry gun is almost useless. With the smart gun you can't run, so if the aliens get past your fire barricade it's game over in a moment. I could only beat that part on Easy, and barely.\nThe Predator campaign is pretty great too but some things just don't cut it (ha-ha). The plasmacaster has become virtually useless since it does a lot less damage, without the auto aim it's hard to hit anything and it drains like HALF of your power reserve for a full, aimed blast. The prox mines from the AvP2 movie are nice, but the Marines will see them if you throw them in their visual fied. The disc is funny too but it no longer has auto aim, programmers shouldn't expect you to keep your aim straight when you're being attacked from all sides. And the spear is... simply overpowered, it can take out any normal target even from pretty far away.\nThe one thing that irritated me both in the Alien and Predator campaigns is the long killing moves when people are shooting at you, isn't it kind of stupid for the Pred to look how beautiful a severed spine is when the victim's friends are taking you apart? Or even worse the long fatalities on the Aliens while you're being cut to shreds from the other Aliens that you didn't know were there, and you're helpless to defend yourself as long as the cutscene isn't finished. I got killed a lot of times in this manner. At least they stopped giving the Pred an unlimited amount of energy and medipacks, it made him way too strong.\n\nI rate it 8 out of 10.","November 26, 2014","true","183.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

In gaming however they really worked! Starting back in the Arcade as a “Final Fight” style beat-em up, the Atari Jaguar in 1994, the PC version in 2000, and a sequel in 2004. All were fun games for their time. So how does the latest in the series hold up? Well it helps if your a fan of Alien, and The Predator movies, and I am so my review may be biased. The game is broken into three campaigns that tie in the main story. Players can choose a Colonial Marine, the Alien, or The Predator. Each class plays very unique with their own abilities. The Marine campaign was my favorite, it captures some of the Aliens feel. There is a great line-up of movie weapons, tense scenes, and a lot of action. My complaints for the Marine are minor. I really wish they added “Aim Down Sites”. Firing from the hip in gaming is just old school, I need my sites! Second complaint is the motion tracker, It's all but useless in the game. I know I'll get some heat for saying this, but Aliens Colonial Marines made far better use of the motion tracker. My second favorite campaign was The Predator. With all of his tools at your disposal, you will feel like an unstoppable hunter. My only complaint on The Predator is the “pred jump”. At times it can be a pain to line up, but once you know the map its less frustrating. The Aliens campaign was my least favorite. The Alien can transition to walls, and run in 3D. It has some interesting fatalities, and is extremely fast. However This is extremely disorientating in first person view, and I can't tell you how many times I ran right by an enemy because of the speed the Alien runs at. This could have been easily fixed if the Alien had 3rd person perspective. The game offers a decent amount of multiplayer modes, and a decent number of maps. The only thing I wish is there was a little more variety in the scenery. Your either in a Jungle, or a pyramid, and that’s about it. The game will run on almost any PC if you adjust the resolution, and graphics options (Not your Apple II, but anything from 2010 and up should be fine). Overall this game despite its flaws is a very fun play, and I recommend it. If you've been passing on this one, and your a fan of either franchise you should pick it up","April 19","true","2.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","4"

The single player is not very lenghty but it compensates for that  with variety, offering the possibility of playing with 3 unique and completely different species, meaning specific gameplay mechanics for each of the characters.\n\nAs a Marine you have a tipical FPS experience, but with a very high amount of tension and atmosphere that gets to the nerves of those of you with a faint heart, and is no slouch in action as well, as hordes of enemies are lurking around almost every corner.\n\nAs a Predator you feel like you are a total badass, with all the arsenal and gizmos we all know and love.\nIt is especially gratifying to stalk your prey from afar, distract it and then lure it to it's untimely demise.\n\nAs the Alien, you have to rely on speed and surprise to ambush your prey. As a totally melee based specie, you need to stick to the shadows and pick your battles carefully, but it is possibly the most gratifying of all the species you can choose from in this game, it relies mostly on skill and less on acessories (by acessories I mean weapons).\n\nIt is far from being perfect though, the game suffers from a huge amount of glitches that were never properly patched and fixed by the developer (Rebellion), and if you plan to play this game online versus other people... You are in for a huge dissapointment. The amount of hacking and glitching in this game is fairly high, and the AvP community despite being small, it is one of the worst uneducated, childish and ridiculous group of children you will likely to ever meet. I recommend this game for it's single player mostly, and if you can get a decent group of people to play with you on fair matches, the MP can be a lot of fun, with the modes Species Team Deathmatch ( 3 teams, one alien, one predator and one marine), Mixed Species Team Deathmatch (2 teams, all species allowed in each of them), Predator Hunt (one player is a Predator while all the others are Marines. The Marine who kills the Predator becomes the hunter and therefore has to try and kill the Marines; Highest scoring player as a Predator wins), Infestation (one player is an Alien, all other marines, the Alien player must kill the marines; When a marine dies he then respawns as an alien to try and kill the remaining humans) and Domination (two teams, one alien and one Marine fight over the control of checkpoints in the map).\n\n\n\nAlso worthy of mention is the co-op, there is a mode in the game called survivor, in which you fight waves of unending Aliens as a Marine with up to four people, and it can be a huge challenge, and it's fairly fun as well.\n\nI recommend this game mostly for it's single player, the three different campaigns are unique, even if they are a little short. MP can be fun, but try to stay away from public servers. The rage, hacking and glitching is usually big on those places.\n\nThe Good\n\n-Three different campaigns, and three different perspectives on the same story\n-Good visuals and sound, particularly the sound effects\n-Lance Henrikssen as Bishop\n-Trophy kills\n\nThe Bad\n\n-Glitches are abundant on MP\n-Hackers are common on public servers\n-Most of the AvP community are raging 10 year olds\n\n7.5/10","July 6, 2011","true","900.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

As a marine you can be scared with your motion tracker and being ready to shoot anything that appears, but my favourite faction is obviously the Predator, you can jump practically anywhere, you can use the combi stick and all the other cool weapons that a Predator has equipped, but the coolest thing about the Predator is that you can turn invisible! and then use that to sneak up on enemies and take their heads as a trophy! Each of the faction's has unique collectibles as well as a Nightmare difficulty which if you die, there is no checkpoint so you must restart the level.\n\nThe game runs really well from an optimization point of view, I was able to run the game at 60FPS! at 1080p with all the graphical settings including the Directx 11 exclusive options maxed out, unfortunately this game really suffers from screen tearing, even with V-Sync on the screen kept tearing constantly, more so for the Alien Campaign then others, but other then that the game is really good on PC.\n\nOverall i really enjoyed the game and have had lots of scary moments on the Marine campaign while having fun tearing them apart on others, If you are fan of the series i would pick up the game and have some fun with it, there is Multiplayer in the game but the servers are dead and the ones you can get into are filled with hackers, so if you do get the game then I would Stick Around! to having fun on the Campaign.","October 30, 2015","true","58.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I'm sure it's even more fun if you're familiar with the three movie series: Alien, Predator and Alien vs. Predator, and their sequels. The game shows a lot of respect for the lore established in those movies and expands a little on it.\n\nThe aliens and predators look great. The music and sound effects are spot on. I found it impressive how the storylines of the three campaigns (marine, alien, predator) are nicely interwoven.\n\nAs you can imagine, the way to play each campaign is completely different depending on the species you play and their weapons and skills, but each campaign even has a different HUD that really fits the species, which adds to an already immersive experience.\n\nYou can adjust the difficulty to fit your play style and your (in)experience with FPS games. You can play the game with a gamepad, but I'm not used to the 'twin stick' thing where one stick moves your character and another stick moves the camera. So I quickly switched to mouse and keyboard, which was a lot smoother for me. You can bind keyboard keys for each species seperately in the options menu.\n\nI haven't tried multiplayer but I gather from other reviews that multiplayer for this game is dead, so if you're looking for a good multiplayer FPS, I suppose you need to look elsewhere. This also means that steam achievement completionists will have a hard time because 12 of the 50 achievements require multiplayer action.\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend this game to anyone who reads this because that means you're at least remotely interested in FPS games or in the movies this game is based upon. But since three single player campaigns of about 5 hours each is all you'll get out of it, I would advise against paying full price for the game and instead waiting for it to be on sale.","April 16","true","20.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you're not? You'll probably love it even more!\nThis game may seem short, (Perhaps)unoriginal, fast paced, etc. n' such, but by all means! It's not!\nThis game has so much more potential to it than most realize! Now, by saying this, I am of course referring to my OWN opinion - Yours is YOURS and all that.\n\nCome, let's go over a few things;\n\nGraphics;\nThe graphics ain't the best I've seen for a game released in the year 2010, but nevertheless delivers! The graphics are still astonishing, still incredibly detailed, but in it's own way, own pace, so to speak.\nIt does have it's moment of mind-blow-itis, yes - It does have it's moments of .... Disappointment, but doesn't every game have containment of such? Come on! If you're not sure, then look it up! Youtube, people! Max settings! Gaming on the Pc Friday night with a bag of your favorite chips and some Mountain Dew, curtains closed, doors closed - absolute silence - absolute darkness. Only focus; The game, and surviving it, you'll try- ohoho! If you want a challenge, then put it on Nightmare difficulty and you'll have yourself a nice evening, trying to complete the 3rd level over and over again, thinking of dozens of ways, strategies to complete that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ level!.... It's an amazing experience, or at least for me; I enjoy difficulty in my games, but hey, there's always easy, or medium for that sake.\nAnyway! Back to the matter at hand! The graphics are overall good, nothing too fancy-smanchy, nothing too... Ew. The game itself doesn't require your computer to be top notch - A decent computer will do just fine on high settings! The visuals, environment n' such is what really gives me that 'tip of the iceberg' feeling! Ugh! Amazing! Haha! Now, I've already been writing too much on the topic of graphics alone! I might shorten this down.. another day at another time, hehe...\n\n\nGameplay;\nOhohoho! Awqh! I can't express it with mere words! You can basically play as all three parts known to the universe! What really amazes me is how every and each campaign has it's own uniqueness! Every campaign felt like a whole different genre overall! In general, yeah, it was all about the same thing, sometimes had to do something that seemed equal as opposed to the other campaigns, but it didn't ruin the expericence! Because with every campaign, you were playing as another 'part'! A.K.A being! *Sigh* Words are so hard to find these days, and people prefer to rather skip the long ones. If you're still here; thanks, I appreciate the time you've used to read this 'review' of sorts. Let's do it like this;\n\n- The Marine; Frightening, thought-provoking, creepy atmosphere (undergoing the section scary, I suppose) , shocks here and there, intriguing, and best of all; Aliens! If you're new, oh... You'll love them little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, ha! The rush you get when shooting them in the head, ah! Wondrous!\n\nThe Predator; Bloody, intriguing, thought-provokin- Aw! You know what? F**k this! xD This review is already way too long! My hands hurt and, well, honestly, based on what I've been telling you so far, aren't you the least more tempted to buy this game? It's WELL worth the money. I promise you; even if you're unfamiliar with the whole thing, theme, universe! You won't be bored, you will not be disappointed! I might make this longer as time pass, but right now, I'm beat! It is currently Saturday noon and I'm devastated after yesterday's late night awesomeness, gaming you-know-what. *Wink wink* Okay, I'll stop.\n\nI hope this not even half-done review will make you buy this game, hell! At least consider it!\n\nThis is Perspective, signing out! Peace! Long live the queen! (LV-426, that's all I'm saying)\n\nThere is so much more to cover, but hey!

Yes, it's different from the previous AvP games, but that doesn't mean it's a bad. Yes, the story could be much, much more interesting, but you don't need it, when you can become a bloody predator! Yes, the AI isn't brilliant, and that is a big con. Yes, multiplayer isn't perfect, but the game has a lot to offer nonetheless.

Predator      Unless you play on easy/normal, you really need to think fast when you are fighting aliens. Killing humans is still easy - hard difficulty doesn't make them any more intelligent.\nCONS:\nSpecies      Description            Marine      Hmm... Could be more interesting if they added features like welding doors, working in team (with good AI, of course), installing/controlling turrets, etc.            Alien      Gameplay is repetitive. They could add evolution egg > facehugger > chestburster > queen and realistic hunting without this whole press E to win, and with good enemy AI.            Predator      Gameplay is interesting only on hard and hardcore. Humans are stupid as hell, and aliens are weak.\nThe multiplayer is unpolished, but it still is somewhat fun to play.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/recommended/10680/","albertrayon","albertrayon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/","1581 products in account","Aliens vs. Predator is a 1st person shooter that continues the tradition of the earlier Alein vs. Predator games. There are three campaigns, each starring a unique character. You can play as a Human Marine, Predator or Alien, and each character has their storyline and playstyle.\n\nHaving recently played some of Alien vs. Predator 2000, I knew a little of what to expect. What I was hoping for was a modernization of that game, because I found that while it may have been a worthy title in its time, it did not really stand up to the test of time in my opinion.  That is an issue with early 3D games and FPSs in general. This game delivered on that, and more so.\n\nThe first improvement to address is the tutorial. AvP 2010 gives you a short tutorial as an introduction to each character so you can become accustomed to the controls. I found myself quickly mastering the majority of controls, although walking up walls as a Xenomorph was still a bit tricky. Aiming your various weapons is easy enough, and the button placement seems to make sense.\n\nThe graphics are really fantastic for what is now a 4 year old game. This was a huge improvement from AvP 2000, and shows you just how far games have come in 10 years. Better graphics help add to the atmosphere, which can be downright scary at times as a Marine.\n\nThe voice acting and sounds are another high point. The beeps on your motion detector mixed with the gutteral sounds of your Alien attackers will begin to fill you with dread. The rave like scene of an early set piece really uses music well to add to the intensity.\n\nWith 3 campaigns, there is a lot of variety to this game not usually found in FPS games. I found that the Marine campaign played much like a Survival Horror FPS, the Alien campaign like a Stealth shooter, and the Predator campaign like an overpowered mixture of both. It really is quite an accomplishment that they could pull all of this off in one game. Being able to switch easily between campaigns after missions is a nice touch.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that Aliens vs. Predator is a licensed game. A lot of your enjoyment will be derived directly from that universe. If you enjoy that license, I can whole heartedly recommend AvP. It's an enjoyable FPS on its own accord, and you will love being able to play as all three species. If you are not a fan of Aliens and Predator, I'd still say this is worth a try. The concept is pretty unique, and the gameplay as the Alien is some of the most enjoyable I've experienced. You will, however, probably find that the story does not do much for you since it requires a bit of knowledge from the movies to fully enjoy.\n\nGrade: B\n","June 30, 2014","true","3.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ViperMSK/recommended/10680/","ViperMSK","Rainbow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ViperMSK/","218 products in account","Developed at Rebellion by the team responsible for the original 1999 PC classic, the all-new Aliens vs. Predator allows players to take the role of three infamous species: Colonial Marines, Predators and Aliens. The game features a unique three-way online multiplayer experience, allowing gamers to battle for survival and the right to be crowned the deadliest species in the galaxy. Each race also has its own distinct action-packed single-player campaign mode, with a storyline that cleverly interweaves with the other two species’ paths. Set on planet BG-386; a human colonist mining group discovers an ancient pyramid containing a dark and horrible secret. Across the galaxy, a race of warriors is alerted to the discovery of their pyramid and a hunting party is dispatched to ensure that it remains sealed at all costs. Deep inside the ruined pyramid meanwhile, nature's deadliest species awakes from centuries of hibernation intent on finding new prey. The Colonial Marine's story is an incredible fight against all odds from horrors lurking in the dark. Surrounded on all sides yet armed to the teeth, the Colonial Marine represents humanity's last stand with the firepower to fight back. As the Alien, players discover what it's like to be the scariest, most murderous creature in the universe, with the ability to traverse any surface at lightning speed in order to get close enough to unleash its deadly claws, tail and teeth. A master of the hunt, the Predator grants the player an arsenal of exotic weaponry with which to stalk from the shadows. Earn the greatest honor by ambushing prey up-close, before butchering them for a gory trophy kill.\nI really enjoyed playing the Predator and the Aliens campaign, because I haven’t experienced that kind of gameplay in any other game yet. Everybody who likes a mix of horror and action should play Aliens vs Predator.\nGiven the garbage most fans have had to go through in recent years, including one luke-warm Aliens vs Predator movie, and the lack of any kind of game attention since Concrete Jungle, AvP is a welcome addition to the series. Yes, its not an A-List game by any stretch of the imagination, but it is still extremely fun for what it is.","July 17, 2014","true","77.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Granted, it isn't quite as good as the original 2 games (especially that of "AvP 2"), it still was brillantly done in its own right.  Not much of a multi-player type person, but the single-player missions can be extremely intense in many parts.  So i'd highly recommend this game whether if you're into multi-player matches, or if you just like the exploration and storyline aspect of the single-player campaigns.","November 12, 2011","true","274.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Are you nuts?\nOkay, lets back up a sec.\n\nLets talk about what it gets right.\n\nVisuals are crisp and great to look at, the enemies look how they should and the enviroments are filled with a dark foreboding atmosphere that fits the two franchises very well. The Xenos and the Preds are represented faithfully to the source material and the setting and story are actually better than the first AVP movie. Yes the occasional AI teammate is painfully stupid and much of the voice acting is terrible. But it makes up for that with challenging difficulty and a short-but-sweet set of campaigns for each side. Multiplayer is alot of fun, it is terribly unbalanced and many times unfair but if you can look past that the multiplayer itself is fun to play. Overall this game is a decent addition to the franchises.

I wish they would do away with the rubbish lobby-multiplayer in a belated patch and replace it with a more traditional PC  multiplayer where one can join/leave a dedicated host or server at will without the wait to find a group or squad. Which goes two fold with a couple -bigger- maps for survival modes.. It's 4 years old but it still graphically holds it's own to modern titles... an update or infusion into this older title could help bring some faith back to the disappointed fans who like myself, despised the insult that is Aliens: Coloniel Marines.\n\nI give this game a 8/10 overall.

The single-player campaign is very short, 5 missions of varying brevity per faction, and they aren't the best in quality.  The controls for the alien, especially if you have the auto-scale-walls option enabled, can take a very long time to get used to.  The multiplayer is almost dead - though there are people playing, it's comprised solely of those who have been playing this game non-stop since launch and are therefore much better than you ever will be.

You basically have three different games and storylines. The alien is pure stealth and speed, the marine relys on gadgets and guns, and the predator relys on techinal and stealthy assaults. Each character has a set of view modes (Pred - Heat vision, Marine - Nightvision), and a set of movement modes. The bosses are a bit easy, but definatly some challenging gameplay at some points.  I dont have a specifically high end computer, but the game looks and runs beautifully. Like night and day compared with console versions, which I also owned, and also returned the day after it came out. It just was very buggy and grainy on my ps3.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/larexus/recommended/10680/","larexus","Larexus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/larexus/","433 products in account","A well done action FPS game that seemed to slip through without being noticed by most people. Play as all 3 species, each with thier own story and goals.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay feels fluent and smooth. FPS drops were very few and far between on my medium end PC on high settings. You spend most of your time traversing through mostly linear levels completing objects along the way. In some areas objectives make you kill waves of enemies or solve puzzling problems such as figuring out how to enter a room, which helps keep that game a little more interesting rather than traveling through from place to place shooting everything in site.\n\nWhere controls are concerned, each species plays differently with thier own style of movement and controls and some are better than others. Playing as the marines feels like your typical FPS game, basically shoot your way through the level with a variety of guns. You feel more vulnerable as a marine as well as Aliens are very quick and come in hordes, and predators are much more powerful.\n\nPlaying as the Alien and Predator is where this game stands out from other FPS games. The predator has a variety of gadgets such as the laser cannon to fight from a distance as well as a spear and claws to tear your enemies to shreds up close. You are able to jump high and far using an ability, this allows the predators to have alot of verticality to combat. You can also go invisible to catch your enemies by surprise, however get to close and the humans with see through you camo. The Aliens are very quick and agile, while playing the Alien you are able to crawl up walls and leave very far. These contols are hard to get the hang of at first but once you get the hang of them you feel pretty deadly. You are quieter but all these perks come with a price, and that is your health. As the alien you will need to learn to be stealthy on your approach to clear rooms as well as know when to run and hide. Both of these species have special instant kill stealth moves and grab kills, however for as cool as they look, they also leave you very vulnerable to attack, their is also no way of cancelling this action and they take a few seconds to finish. If you are attacked during thease few seconds you will most likely die or barely get away.\n\nGraphics\nOn high the graphics looked really good, they felt like real areas and fit the setting of the Alien/Predator universe. The levels are pretty well designed, and their is a variety of settings to traverse through as you go through the story such as the forest, ruins, structures and a few others. The gun fire flash looks good in dark rooms and the lighting is done very well adding to the spooky theme of some areas. The design and animation of the Aliens and Predators look well designed and look like their movie counterparts. The animation looks good, especially the Alien looks like it had a lot of work done to it to make it look and move realistically as it crawls over the walls. The animations during the stealth/grab kills are very well done and look badass and gory the way they should be in this style of game.\n\nAudio\nThe audio is decent, although some of the guns sounded terrible and wimpy. The sound design during the levels does a pretty good job of making you feel on edge and adds a little bit to the suspense. The aliens sounded like the aliens from the movies however nothing special, same with the predator, you hear his significant and unique sounds but its nothing really special or new. The marines are terribly voice acted and their likes sounds cheasy.\n\nFor the most part the audio is decent and will add to the feel of the setting but nothing special.\n\nStory\nThe story are different and each species has their own goal in mind however their is crossover between each story. As a marine you are trying to fight back the Aliens and find out what happened after a problem occurs in a research facility your goal is to find out what happened, where they are coming from, and how to stop it, but end up crossing paths with the predator down the line changing some of your objectives.\n\nThe Alien story line has you playing an Alien captured by humans and tested on. When the queen calls you seek to find her, only to be restrained by the humans, however after an issue arises during an experiment you are able to break the shackles that bind you down, allowing you to fight back, escape, and find your queen to learn why she is calling you.\n\nThe Predator story arc has you playing as a predator needing to prove himself to the elders to earn his right to be a hunter. This has you traveling through multipul areas killing Aliens in trials from the elders, through your trials you will cross paths with the marines leading for some objectives to become skewed as you destroy the resistance.\n\nSummary\nAliens vs. Predator is a decent FPS action game that goes off the path from your basic FPS game. Being able to play as all 3 species with thier own unique abilities, movements and story arcs is fun and helps the game feel fresh. The story is decent, with some being better than others. They did a good job of balancing the characters out with thier own advantages and weaknesses making each species feel like it should. The world looks good and well designed. The controls feel good and tight, the only one that took a while to get used to was the aliens movements because of its quick pace and ability to climb on walls and other surfaces.\n\nThis is a good game that would be good to get on sale. Fans of first person shooters may enjoy the originality of playing as all 3 characters in this game, however if you are looking for a horror game, this may not be it. While it seems to try to be one, it doesnt seem to commit to the idea as the game progresses, at most this game may hit the creepy feeling at some points but thats about it.\n\nI can not comment on the multiplayer as I never tried it myself, but for the most part from what I've heard is that its fun but almost always dead. So maybe with a few friends it could be fun for a get together.","January 29, 2015","true","8.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BloodySloth/recommended/10680/","BloodySloth","BloodySloth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BloodySloth/","435 products in account","This game is a hell of a lot of fun, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  You just have to make peace with its flaws.\n\nLike in previous AvP games, the campaign is split into three parallel mini-campaigns, which intertwine in a fun and interesting way, allowing each species to use common elements of the setting's colonies and ruins in different ways for different purposes, and to different ends.  This may end up dissapointing some who will see the campaign as lazily reusing map assets so they don't have to tailor make levels for each character, but I find this complaint falls flat.  The level design smartly builds a unique playing space for each of the game's three species in each game level, something which must have taken much deliberation and iteration, whether or not you agree with the design decision.\n\nEach storyline is really successful in acheiving a different feel and imparting a unique importance to each character;  The marine campaign is a terrifying account of a human just trying to stumble his way through this whole mess alive, the Predator campaign is full of bravado, badassitude, and honor, and the Alien campaign is all about essentially trolling the other two species in a deadly way and undermining everything anyone else is trying to acheive.  Of the three, the Alien's campaign is easily the weakest, although there is still a lot of fun to be had terrifying marines and pinning scientists to the ground for facehugger implantation.\n\nThe campaigns themselves are surpisingly challenging, though short.  I found that the difficulty of the singleplayer game is mostly fair, harshly punishing stupid mistakes, though your mileage may vary.  A huge part of the game is a keen awareness of your own limitations as a human, Alien, or Predator, and also a smart but controlled exploitation of your own advantages, leading to an experience that can get surpisingly cerebral for what otherwise presents itself as a big, dumb action game (and the story IS big and dumb). The checkpoint system in single player is bizarre and terrible, unfortunately.  This meshes incredibly poorly with how difficult the game can get, leading to moments I just wanted to give up and walk away from the entire game.\n\nUltimately, on the single player side of things, expect a dissapointingly short, dumbly written, but absolutely exciting and relatively unique (at least, in this day and age) romp through the built up mythos of all three species.\n\nMultiplayer, unfortunately, is a bit of a mixed bag.  At the best of times, Alien vs Predator's multiplayer is just huge loads of fun.  It's action packed one moment, tensely silent another, and totally empowering the next, just before you realize you're outgunnned or outnumbered and you start running away from other players in terror.  Unfortunately, people's complaints about rampant stupid garbage in multiplayer are SPOT ON ACCURATE.  The different deathmatch modes highlight this game's unfun nonsense way more often than other, more mechanically interesting and unique game modes; unfortunately, TDM is far and away the most popular game mode, drawing in players for its simplicity and action.\n\nBe prepared to scream impotently at your computer as you, a slavering, 7 foot horror from outer space leap at a hapless marine from across the room, only to bounce off and land stunned on the ground as if the guy were made out of steel and bolted to the floor, simply because he saw you or heard you and blocked.  Prepare to occasionally see marines beating predators and aliens in melee combat.  Prepare for plasmacasters still being rage inducing, even 13 years after AvP2.  Prepare, even, for a stealth kill mechanic that encourages players to just run circles around each other to see who can get enough of a glimpse of another player's back to hit the "E" key and get an easy instakill.  At this point in the game's life,  players are obliged to play by their own made up rules about when it's okay to get an "E kill" or when weapons like the plasmacaster are permitted.\n\nThe matchmaking, additionally, is absolutely terrible (although there is a server browser), and at this point in time there are very few players, making it a chore to find a game running, let alone a game running something more interesting than Team Death Match.\n\nThat all being said, when you can get a good game going, the game is really good.  Even through multiplayer's bull, fun shines through.  The Hunt mode from AvP2 returns as Predator Hunt, featuring one Predator vs a team of marines, and is excellent and very evocative of the movies.  The Infestation mode is somewhat similar in set up; the entire team starts as marines, and one of them is chosen randomly to spawn as an alien.  When the alien kills a marine player, the killed player switches sides and joind the aliens, and this continues until the dwindling human group survives for long enough or is wiped out.  Aliens vs Predator also features its own co-op horde mode, Survivor, where marine players take on waves of alien bots. While tense and fun in its own right, Survivor is a bit too light on features compared to the horde modes of other games to really hold my attention.  These sit alongside the game's own point capture mode and three different rulesets for Deathmatch, adding up to a fairly large catalog of different ways to play.\n\nAll in all, Aliens vs Predator got an unfair shake, I think.  Huge hype combined with mixed reviews to convince the public that the game was a middling cash in, when in actual fact I think that the developers put a lot of thought and heart into bringing back the mechanics of an old multiplayer classic while still trying to innovate.  A lot of the moves they made in production are clear missteps and there's no hiding that, but if you can accept or work past the game's obvous problems, there's quality fun to be had here, and the game certainly offers an experience that simply can't be had anywhere else.\n\nIt's certainly more fun than Aliens: Colonial Marines, and manages to feel more authentic even with how much effort A:CM's team put into recreating environments and elements from the Aliens film.  I just wish AvP's Survivor mode was more like A:CM's Bug Hunt.","January 26, 2014","true","15.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The game is always in the first person view, making it highly realistic but a bit confusing when running on walls and it takes some getting used to.\n\nThe sounds are highly emersive and very realistic, adding to the atmosphere of the game.\n\nThe graphics are very good (as already mentioned the game is based on the unreal engine 3 , so there isn't really a way to could look bad anyway ), naturally I found one or two places where the textures glitch out but those are random spots on the terrain where the majority of players wouldn't probably visit.\n\nThe gameplay is solid, the Marines campaign gets a bit tiring since it's pretty much a lot of the same. The aliens campaign is the best however the shortest, (you can't have your cake and eat it too) the predators campaign however kind of doesn't fit in... What I mean by that is that the entire battle between the aliens and humans doesn't really leave much space for the the predators story to develop, but then again I'm just nit-picking at a really solid title.","January 12, 2014","true","8.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It's definitly not worth 50€ but it sure as hell is worth 5€. Primary interest of the game being the multiplayer, it just brings in a gamer's life something rather "fresh" to have fun with, weither you choose the brutal Predators, the sneaky Aliens or the over armed Humans you've no choice but to be delighted with every kill you grab, literally.\n\nThe two DLC wich are just map packs are in my opinion just a racket, although the 2 of them at 3€ instead of 12€ make it well worth it.

The game offers you mult segmented parts where you play between Marine, Alien, and Predator stories. Each segment may or maynot be tied into each other but you can play on as one character through all the way or switch between each character between missions. First person controls are great and all actions and aesthetics are a perfect match to the movies. aliens can cling to ceilings and bleed corrosive blood, Marines have motion detectors and flares to help locate threats, and the Predator has his multi functional mask and futuristic arsenal. Overall its a revamp of a classic that adds depth that newer games offer. The ambiance of a dark hallway can actually become a dark threat and a predator feels powerful but still outgunned.

I'd highly reccomend this the any avid Alien franchise player. Not only does this have an immersive single player where you play as all three races and watch each invidual timeline unfold unpon each others, but it has a great multiplayer as well. My only complaint about the multiplayer is the so-called "stealth kills" button mashers it can take away moral of opposing teams and players. I believe these movies should be used sparingly and made a limit to how many you can use in a match. Other then that I love the game and story.

All 3 sides are interesting to play as. And while you may think the marines would be the least interesting to play as, nothing could farther the truth (trust me). The devs did an outstanding job of making all factions feel and p[ay unique just like the older games. Gameplay wise there's a ton of brutal executions  via stealth attacks you can unleash on your foes, from riping out someone's throat as a Alien (or doing something ugodly worse with your tail) to of course ripping out people's spinal cord and collecting skulls as a predator. Even better,  many of these executions can be preformed in multiplayer all be it less "flashy". Only issues I have with the game are control related, namely with the alien who takes a bit of getting use too.. And the campaigns are a bit short, though I reckon I can't expect 3, 12 hour long campaigns in one game.  It's an outstanding game that I highly recommend, and much better than (in my opinion) than newer aliens/predator based games.","February 26, 2015","true","14.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The general consensus of the title is that it's alright, but could have been better had the developers spent more time on it.\n\nThe single player portion of the game is where it shines the most. The three campaigns are alright, though their length is a primary concern. All three wont take you very long to complete, and this is particularly jarring since the previous two PC games AvP and AvP2 both had very long campaigns.\n\nThe biggest problem with this game is in it's multiplayer. The races are absurdly balanced, to the point where it's not enjoyable for anyone. The Predator is an overpowered demigod, the Marine can knock away Xenomorphs and the Alien is a fragile speedster that is fragile as ♥♥♥♥. This is possibly the biggest sin this game committed since AvP2 had amazingly good balance for it's three races. If you end up finding yourself in a multiplayer game all that ends up occuring is players spam the melee counter button.\n\nAdd in the lack of modding support (something that added longevity for AvP2), and lack of dedicated servers (For a series previously renowned for it's multiplayer clans) all you have here is one of the biggest examples of wasted potential. AvP2010 depresses me moreso because of how average the game is, and had they spent more time on it the game could have been the greatest in the series.\n\nThankfully it still isn't as bad as Colonial Marines.","March 2, 2013","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

The game offers you mult segmented parts where you play between Marine, Alien, and Predator stories. Each segment may or maynot be tied into each other but you can play on as one character through all the way or switch between each character between missions. First person controls are great and all actions and aesthetics are a perfect match to the movies. aliens can cling to ceilings and bleed corrosive blood, Marines have motion detectors and flares to help locate threats, and the Predator has his multi functional mask and futuristic arsenal. Overall its a revamp of a classic that adds depth that newer games offer. The ambiance of a dark hallway can actually become a dark threat and a predator feels powerful but still outgunned. A must have for fans of either series!","September 15, 2014","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's definitly not worth 50€ but it sure as hell is worth 5€. Primary interest of the game being the multiplayer, it just brings in a gamer's life something rather "fresh" to have fun with, weither you choose the brutal Predators, the sneaky Aliens or the over armed Humans you've no choice but to be delighted with every kill you grab, literally.\n\nThe two DLC wich are just map packs are in my opinion just a racket, although the 2 of them at 3€ instead of 12€ make it well worth it.

At a rock-bottom sale price, it's definitely worth purchasing, especially if you are into competitive multiplayer FPSes. The single player offers some decent thrills, however it's very much a "been there, done that" affair with far too much level recycling. Multiplayer is fast and wild, with unlockable skins as you continue to play. I can see what problems critics had with the game, but don't pass this up when it goes on sale (which is frequently), especially if you are a fan of the franchise.","January 29, 2012","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'd highly reccomend this the any avid Alien franchise player. Not only does this have an immersive single player where you play as all three races and watch each invidual timeline unfold unpon each others, but it has a great multiplayer as well. My only complaint about the multiplayer is the so-called "stealth kills" button mashers it can take away moral of opposing teams and players. I believe these movies should be used sparingly and made a limit to how many you can use in a match. Other then that I love the game and story.

For a fan of the series, it's gonna be pretty entertaining and enjoyable. You'll probably finish it or at least play a good deal of it before it gets old. The reason I specify the requirement of being a fan of Alien/Predator is that you'll be interested enough in the fact that your favorite films are in video game form that you will ignore the shortcomings of the game. And there are many.\nFirst off, the entire human campaign is god awful. Keep in mind, people, I still gave this game a thumbs up. The FPS mechanics are clunky, the guns are basically crap and in general you're super limited. It's as simple as that. Killing the xenomorphs can be an absolutely infuriating task to undertake, as they climb all over the walls and your terrible weaponry does stupidly limited damage. There are exceptions, of course, but you might find yourself dying repeatedly in the most annoying situations simply because the human as a character is too damn ♥♥♥♥♥♥. That being said, having xenomorphs as your enemies is kind of cool, and getting to splatter them all over the walls of spaceships is fairly rewarding.\nMoving on, the xenomorph campaign is honestly very cool, provided you can master the challenging mechanics. The thought behind the movement and abilities of the aliens was solid. However, specifically in PC execution, this aspect of the gameplay must have been pretty damn hard to make a reality. Long story short, it can be pretty damn hard to effectively control a xenomorph in this game. Still, being able to move super fast and climb all over walls and the ceiling to destroy people is attractive, especially if you're a movie fan. (Who doesn't admire the killing potential of those things?)\nThe predator campaign is both the weirdest and in my opinion, the most fun part of the game. As the dreadlocked killer you can utilize a decent variety of weaponry, ranging from technologically advanced to downright brutally simple. The potential, again, is there. Once you get the hang of all the damn keys you have to push to actually accomplish anything, you'll definitely have a blast with this guy. The really unfortunate parts of the predator lie in two areas, completely unrelated. First, you're too f**king weak. If the only human to beat a predator was the Governator himself, (I live in CA) then there should be no reason why a few bullets from incredibly stupid human AI should be killing you so damn effectively. By contrast, the predator makes short work of xenomorphs. Just don't get spotted, I guess. The second problem in my eyes is the fact that the killing animations, while cool, are few. Once you (spoiler alert) rip out the spine of 10 soldiers in a row, it can get kind of old.\nAll of the above considered, and being a fan of the films and the universe, I maintain that this game is pretty damn fun. It's violent enough and at some points, even nerve racking enough to enjoy for a few dozen hours. I put about 20 hours into this game before I dropped it, so I figure you're paying about a dollar per hour if you pay at my average pace. That ain't too bad. If you want a game to play for a few days and you got a couple bucks, buy it. If it's ever on sale, definitely pick it up!\n\nNOTE: You will still be much better off with Alien Isolation, sacrificing the predators for a much more developed, graphically intense, legitimately scary and more successfully story driven experience. Unfortunately, that game is still priced at $9999 on Steam. One day, people. One day.","March 25, 2015","true","20.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Works perfectly with the XBOX controller for windows and I found the controls easy to use. Game runs smoothly, though I recommend for less lag turning down the resolution. I noticed when I was playing the campaign, it would lag a bit and some enemies seemed to teleport by the time I would try to shoot them; I would end up dying because of this.\n\nThe story for each campaign connects and you get 3 different views on it! I found it to be engaging and fun. An experience you will never forget!\n\nAs for online, I know many people were worried about not many people playing on the servers, but when I went on there were various servers to choose from. People still play this a lot! Especially since it is on PC. If you are playing the console version, yes, the servers might be dead, but PC? That hardly seems to be a problem.\n\nIf anything, join groups to find others who frequently play online.\n\nHighly recommend if you are looking for an action game with some scares in it!

Multiplayer is good though map size could have been bigger and more variations, there are map pack bundles but they should be cheaper, and it was one of the reasons many didnt buy the mappacks although myself had bought them just to see and theyre better but no other people seems havent bought because i never seen anyone play them online.\n\nOverall good AvP flick with great potential.

This game puts you in the eyes of your favorite species: Xenomorph, Predator, and Colonial Marine, all with unique characteristics and abilites. Xenomorphs can traverse on walls  and sneak up on enemies only to tear their head off. Predators can go invisible for a short time and have thermal optics to better see enemies, slashing them to bits. And Marines, well.. they have guns. Being able to play as all 3 species puts a whole twist on the franchise, and allows people to finally realize what it feels like to be a bloodthirsty Predator. While this game is old, it is still a classic. My one and only complaint is that the campaign is rather short for all the species. You basically play for awhile completeling various objectives, fight a boss, then switch species. It can be over quick, but still very enjoyable. If you enjoy the movies, you'll love the game.","January 31, 2015","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

WTF is a pistol whip going to do against a Xeno or Pred about to shaft you?\n2)  Predalien that can hop through lava?  Come on, downing the queen early on was more plausible, as was the Praetorian.\n3)  Voice-less main character?  In this age of story-telling, having a silent protagonist is kinda lackluster to the product.\n4)  Doesn't seem to be enough fear and suspense in some areas for a game based on two classics of the same genre.\n\nSo, while I give the game props for decent level design and graphics, along with some interesting play options . . . it's kinda lackluster for the series compared to the two originals.  I recommend this game to those who truly love the series or like the potential in the multiplayer . . . other than than, it's kind of a meh level thumbs up.","January 7","true","16.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It holds up well for a 2010 game. the only issue I had with it is the AI, they are so dopey. Aliens would sometimes run around in circles and do predictable patterns, one of the bosses in the predator campaign is a downright joke and with the predator cloak ablity I was getting spotted from far out which didn't make any sense since with the alien you could pretty much sneak up to marines and tickle them. I didn't try the multiplayer due to the fact that it's pretty much died off, and the people left playing are either hackers or badmins according to the forums. (Inb4 someone comments saying it hasn't and it has its peak time and thaangs.) So if you haven't played 2010 aliens vs. predator before I recommend you pick it up if its cheap enough and if you want a laugh head over to the forums and watch people claim there clan is the best in a dead game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Inahle/recommended/10680/","Inahle","[Insert name here]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Inahle/","39 products in account","Aliens vs Predator 3 is one of my all time favorite games. It is very under-rated. Ill give you a basic run down of the game.\n\nPREDATOR: He is my personal favorite. Movies and games,the predator is like the ultimate hunter. He is very powerful, when taking down marines this can require patience if there are mutiple of them. The predators advantages consist of his health, his weapons, and his claw speed. For his health he has the most health in the game. Him being the biggest one of the three this is not suprising. His weapons are godly poweful. He has four weapons. The campaign starts you with them in this order. Plasma caster, Mines, Smart disc, and Spear.  The plasma caster is a very powerful weapon. If you charge it long enough if it hits it is an automaic one hit. The plasma caster automatically predicts where youre target is going to go and fires there. The proximity mines are essentialey plasma clamores that detect in all directions. This is most effective against marines as they arent fast enough to escape one if they set it off. The smart disc, my favorite weapon, Is a edged disc that is guided by the laser on your mask when you throw it. It can bounce off of walls an absured amount of times and make the enemy ♥♥♥♥ their pants. If it hits the body it leaves any species with one light melee attack left in them. On hitting the head the target will instantly die. This works against predators often as their head is pretty big. Now finally for the spear. I feel like this one would have made first if it werent for my love of the disc. The spear is a skillshot weapon that can miss often. If it does hit it is a guaranteed kill. That is it for the predator other than the fact that it is harder to knock him down and while his light atack is slower than the aliens his heavy attack is much faster.\n\n\nALIEN: The alien is a more aggressive charcter in general. The alien has only its melee, to make up for this it has the most mobility in the entire game. It can climb on any surface. Its heavy attack is an insant if they are on the wall. It wont do full heavy attack damage if you dont hit them in the head. If you do manage to hit them in the head they are pretty much screwed. As it stuns and does alot of damage. A second tail will usually kill them. The alien can be very prone to dieing if they fight up too close to their target and make their approach obvious. The alien has the second most health in the game. In melee combat what they have superior to the predator is their light attack is much faster. Their heavy attack although slower stuns longer. Their finishing moves AKA grabs are usually faster. This can be an upside or a down-side depending on how you look at it, but the alien automatically regenerates health.\n\n\nMARINE: The marine is sterotyped as the worst character in the game. He is not. The reason his seems to be is he is very difficult although when mastered is a hell hole to deal with. The marine has the lowest health and mobility. The marine fights with guns.\nGUNS:\nPistol: It is his weakest weapon although it has unlimited ammo.\nPulse rifle: It is his auto-matic assult rifle. It is the all around weapon. It has alot of ammo its mag size being 99. Jesus. PS You also get to start with this is multiplayer when you spawn. Its secondary fire is a grenade. AKA Noob toob for cod players.\nShotgun: If you have enemies that like to pounce at you instead of blocking try to hit them with this last second. The shotgun is a very up-close weapon its secondary fire is a buckshot that will stun and instakill if close enough.\nSniper: My favorite weapon. If you hit all shots in the body it will three hit. Don't let that fool you into thinking its bad. Its semi automatic so this seems op to some players. The second shot will stun too. If you hit an alien or predator in the head they will be stunned so finish them with one more bullet as headshots will leave them with low enough health to die to this.\nSmartgun: The marines last but not least weapon. This is like a minigun except with a square on your screen that it has aimbot in. This thing is the bain of predator players. It will detect them while they are invisible. The only downsides to this weapon are having low ammo. Cant run while holding it and it takes up two weapon slots.\n\nIn my oppinion this is one of the most under-rated games of all time. This game derserves so much love that it doesnt get. The only thing that ruins my fun is hackers which arent too common but you will see one of you play this enough. I want you to try this game. Its not even that expensive. To me if it were 100 dollars I would still get it. I hope you have fun in your journeys of this game!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChaosKirby98/recommended/10680/","ChaosKirby98","ChaosKirby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChaosKirby98/","80 products in account","Very fun game. Granted, it is 5 years old now, it has pretty impressive graphics. Now, I've had this game for a while and never really downloaded it because I expected it to not work on my computer. I recently decided "I might as well try it" so I downloaded it, and played it. It ran perfectly.\n\nBut I'm not here to talk about the Graphics, I'm here to talk about why it's fun.\n\nFirst impressionsWell, first thing I thought of when I loaded the game up was Metroid Prime. Why? Well the Main Menu, as well as the gameplay just kinda reminded me of it. Especially the Predator's playthrough. I still can't shake the Metroid Prime vibe it gives me, but I like it x3\n\nNow, onto the campaigns:\n\nThe PredatorSo. The ultimate bounty hunter (next to Samus Aran of course) in your control. I didn't really know what to expect at first, but I went through the tutorial and was like "hey this game's pretty neat!" I liked how the predator could jump to areas (it's a bit weird that it didn't let me sometimes, but then I realized you have to be at a certain distance). The Predator has a variety of weapons at his disposal (who doesn't know that though) and has an interesting playstyle. I kept uncloaking accidently when I mean to use the Predator vision, but that's my own fault xD I eventually stopped the confusion, and managed to play the Predator alright.\n\nThe MarinesNow this was the second campaign I decided to try out, because I wanted to get a feel of all the playstyles before I go through the entire Predator campaign. This was a drastic change from the Predator, mainly because you can't exactly jump around or use special vision to see your enemies. I didn't mind it though, I actually liked the "helpess" feel it kinda gave. It gave a more serious, and spooky, playstyle because you only have a flare and a flashlight to see in the dark, and although you do have a gun, and a radar, you still need to be on your toes. If you want a good "scare" (and I mean that lightly, more so creepy if anything), I'd say play as Marines.\n\nThe AliensYou know the saying "Last but not least", or, "Save the best for last"? Well, I didn't intend to play the Aliens last, but the Predator just caught my eye first. When I played as The Alien, I actually got a very strong "I'm a pet dog" feel. I dunno, I found it entertaining to act as if I were the humans' Alien pet. But aside from that, the gameplay of the Alien was AWESOME. I don't know about you, but the mobility of the Alien, and knowing you're a huge threat to humans (and maybe Predators) gives me the biggest boner most excitement when I play as it. Why, you ask? Well, my reason is that the Alien is the coolest freakin' thing in the game (next to the Predator) to play as. I just love being able to climb on walls, hiss whenever I want, and crawl SUPER FREAKIN' FAST, as well as have a huge tail. I love the tail. I can't even explain anymore why I love the Alien so much, it's just my favorite one to play as. He's so fast, and so sneaky. Gotta love it.\n\n\nMultiplayerI know this game is 5 years old, but hey, I decided why not try the multiplayer? I searched for a lobby, and managed to find 2 other people. Yes, the multiplayer is unfortunately very very dead, BUT I do believe that if you get a bunch of friends to play with (which I have yet to do, but I really want to), you'll most likely have a great time.\n\n\n\nAnywho, I really do recommend this game, and it's actually on sale now for like $3.74, so get it while it's still cheap!! It's worth it, trust me.\n\n\n\nFor any tl;dr people\nPredator Predator first playthrough I chose\nPredator is pretty cool, variety of weps, interesting playstyle\nMarines Gives "spooky/creepy" feel\nAlmost helpess, only source of light is flare + Flashlight\nYou have guns, but watch your back\nAliens My favorite playstyle\nSuper freakin' agile/fast/awesome\nYou have a very awesome tail to kill with\nBeing a huge threat (to humans and maybe Predator) feels awesome\nMultiplayer Ded :c\nCould potentially be VERY fun with friends\nWorth it if you have a lot of friends to play with\nSo yeah. That's my review of Aliens vs. Predator. Try it for yourself, see which playstyle is your favorite. :)","October 11, 2015","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All the unique factions, weapons, skins, and gamemodes make this game an awesome fps!\n\nSingle Player: The single player is a basic campaign mode. There are three different campaigns, each about 3 hours long. You can play the Alien campaign, Marine campaign, and Predator campaign. It's cool how all these stories are connected but with different perspectives.\n\nMultiplayer: The multiplayer is a standard fps online multiplayer. You can play as the 3 different factions, play all sorts of unique gamemodes, and level up to unlock skins for your factions. As a marine, you use guns and grenades to eliminate your enemies. The guns are a pulse rifle, pistol, shotgun, sniper rifle, flamethrower, smart gun, and rocket launcher. Playing as a marine is a basic fps basically. The Alien faction is a speedy faction which can climb up walls, go in vents, and do parkour. They use their tails, claws, and stealth takedowns to elimenate enemies. The Predator faction uses all sorts of weapons and gadgets. Spears, missile launchers, and razor blades. Predators can also cloak and use heat vision. It is pretty easy to find a server, and a decent amount of people play.\n\nGameplay & Modes: The game is basically an fps. The factions are balanced with unique skills and skins. In the campaign, there are many stealth missions which you have to use stealth and takedowns to eliminate enemies.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/codamadius/recommended/10680/","codamadius","Frillin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/codamadius/","139 products in account","Story  Aliens vs. Predator has a very short and sweet intertwining story between Aliens, Predators and Marines. So with that said, you play as all 3. If you've seen the Aliens VS. Predator movie, you're stepping into the same idea. There really isn't anything special about the story in any of the 3 campaigns but the best one is Marines in terms of this.\n\nGameplay Each character you play as has their own unique set of skills and weapons. Marines are able to use an assault rifle, shotgun, grenades and pistols. Predators have their scanners, claws, stealth mode, distraction (this obviously won't be in multiplayer), plasma cannon, discs, polearms and mines. Aliens just use their claws and tail and rely on the shadows and speed to gain their kills. Aliens are easily the hardest as they have very little defense and health, but this makes them very fun.\n\nMultiplayer Multiplayer in Aliens VS. Predator is among the most broken if not the most broken multiplayer system I have ever seen. I went into multiplayer expecting maybe a little bias towards predators and aliens and thinking maybe it would feel slightly unfair until you got the hang of things.....but there is clearly very little if any skill involved being a Predator. You have to rely on your set of skills as each class like in the campaigns, only Predators have no limit to their gadgets. They don't have to wait for a recharge or take their time to aim their charged shots and so all you will see is them camping up on buildings and using their auto aimed plasma cannons. In the event that they do come and fight you face to face, marines cannot knock them back or stun them making them virtually impossible to kill unless you aren't spotted. As an Alien, it's best to work in numbers like they naturally do. Aliens are fun to play and you can defend against them as a predator or marine making the battles with them even. And you already know that predators can just use their plasma cannons to home in on you nearly instantaneously. Basically, if you want to enjoy multiplayer do not play as the marines unless you're a masochist as they're slow and easy targets. Stick to Predator and Alien for the multiplayer experience and you will have fun.\n\nGraphics and sound  This isn't a new game but the graphics and sound are very well done. The only thing that will annoy you is hearing the marines say the same few lines over and over again. But this can be overlooked as the game is fun to play.\n\nOverall Singleplayer will take you about 6-7 hours getting through the 3 small campaigns. Apart from the ridiculous balance issues and frustration that followed realizing this, the game is solid and is fun as an alien or predator in multiplayer, and all 3 are equally fun in the campaign. I just wish singleplayer could've been a lot longer. Recommended on sale.","October 19, 2015","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In fact, this is my second favorite AVP game(The first being AVP2, which unfortunately isn't available on steam) The graphics are incredible and each of the three single player campaigns are quite long, and let's you choose to play as either Alien, Predator or Lunch. In fact, each is like a game in and of it's self! My favorite Campaign is the Alien campaign....it's ALWAYS the alien campaign!\n\nIn fact, if I were told to find fault in the game I would be very hard pressed! The game is very well polished as far as FPS titles goes. It's very well fleshed out, and I am quite pleased! I guess though I would like to see the game more active in the online area. However I am more interested in the SP aspect of games, the Multiplayer capabilities is just an added bonus(unless it's a co-op mode...i love those).\n\nIf you love Aliens(or Predator), and love a solid story driven single player experience, then I highly recommend this game! If you are only interested in Multiplayer then you might want to reconsider due to the few people who do play online.","January 23, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It holds up well for a 2010 game. the only issue I had with it is the AI, they are so dopey. Aliens would sometimes run around in circles and do predictable patterns, one of the bosses in the predator campaign is a downright joke and with the predator cloak ablity I was getting spotted from far out which didn't make any sense since with the alien you could pretty much sneak up to marines and tickle them. I didn't try the multiplayer due to the fact that it's pretty much died off, and the people left playing are either hackers or badmins according to the forums. (Inb4 someone comments saying it hasn't and it has its peak time and thaangs.) So if you haven't played 2010 aliens vs. predator before I recommend you pick it up if its cheap enough and if you want a laugh head over to the forums and watch people claim there clan is the best in a dead game.

WTF is a pistol whip going to do against a Xeno or Pred about to shaft you?\n2)  Predalien that can hop through lava?  Come on, downing the queen early on was more plausible, as was the Praetorian.\n3)  Voice-less main character?  In this age of story-telling, having a silent protagonist is kinda lackluster to the product.\n4)  Doesn't seem to be enough fear and suspense in some areas for a game based on two classics of the same genre.\n\nSo, while I give the game props for decent level design and graphics, along with some interesting play options . . . it's kinda lackluster for the series compared to the two originals.  I recommend this game to those who truly love the series or like the potential in the multiplayer . . . other than than, it's kind of a meh level thumbs up.","January 7","true","16.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatredponydudething/recommended/10680/","thatredponydudething","Darky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatredponydudething/","256 products in account","Time to update an old review! Oh boy here we go, a 2010 title and yet here I am 6 years later loving it to death. To put it quite simply, this is an amazing game for its time. Id say that for an attempt to make not only the alien and predator come together, but add in marines to the mix for an amazing 3 way bloody orgy? They did an amazing job. Once more, this is my review on the game and with my love for the Alien and Predator series, this review may seem bias. However I will do my best to give an honest review. So ready to kick this off? Lets do it!\n\nToday were gonna do something different, were gonna start with the cons of the game. Why? Why not, and no Im not starting with cons because they outweigh the pros. I just want to go ahead and spill the beans on what may potentally ruin this game from being well...one of the greatest.\n\nCons: The multiplayer is DEAD. Thats the biggest con I can think of truth be told. The game is 6 years old, yes, but the multiplayer was dead within the first year of the game coming out. Sadly that might have been the death of this game all together. There are plenty of modes to play from, such as hunted and infestation. TDM and even flat out DM, which would pit alien on alien, predator on predator, and marine on marine. Of course like I said before, it was a massive bloody orgy so all 3 would still fight eachother. If this game was still alive, the multiplayer would certainly be worth playing.\n\nSome weaponry. I say some because Im talking specifically about the flame thrower and smart gun. The smart gun was literally just an aimbot in the hands of a marine. Cloaked predator? They can see you. Alien hiding in the dark? They can see you. Now the flamethrowers only problem is the after burn, as an alien I have little to no clue to get rid of it other than sprinting fast down a corridor and hoping the fire stops. As a predator you have the ability to heal so Im sure that may negate the whole burning thing.\n\nAs far as cons go, thats about it. Now for the good stuff, right?\n\nPros. The story, well, the story as far as campaign goes, is something that I loved to play over and over. All three stories overlap yet none of the 'main characters' never really meet up. The alien story follows an alien who has been in captivity since birth and escaped when Weyland opened up the predator temple underground, he then aims to free his queen and make a hive. I wont speak any endings so no spoiler alerts. The predator story consists of a predator going onto the planet to find out what happened to a team of young bloods, and honor his code. Lastly the marine story is to contain the xenomorph outbreak in the colony.\n\nThe multiplayer (While it was alive I mean). Back when the game came out me and my good buddy played a ton of multiplayer and honestly? It was one of the funnest things to do. Mostly TDM since it was two teams that could consist of any combination of marines, aliens, and predators.\n\nI think I gave the rough and short of it, truthfully its a great game single player wise and if the multiplayer wasnt dead (Boy Im just running that into the ground, arent I?) that would be another great thing from the game. Even for a 6 year old game, Id still go give it a try if you even enjoy the AvP series.","March 30, 2012","true","28.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I've owned this game on the PS3 and 360 and finished it both times while playing a hefty dose of multiplayer too.\n\nTo Keep this short and sweet - stick it on Nightmare mode and enjoy. Nightmare mode on the Marine campaign offers incredible pants-browning moments and the in the Alien and Predator campaigns you really get a sense of accomplishment taking down a group of Marines/Synthetics. Nightmare mode makes you really reconsider how you play the game - being stealthy as a Xeno/Pred and cautious as a Marine is all the more important and can really make you feel as though you are staying true to their movie portrayals.\n\nAs for multiplayer - I would recommend you stay clear. The Predator is OP'd and you will find a lot of terrain exploitation going on which, in the end, just frustrated me to the point I didn't enjoy playing anymore.\n\nGraphics are much better than console counterparts in DX11 mode, while Atmosphere and gameplay more than make up for it's shortcomings in it's story.\n\nWorth the purchase.","September 27, 2014","true","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The campaigns can all be beaten in about 10-15 hours of play total - give or take some hours based on your proficiency and desire for achievement hunting.  And it has difficulty settings, xp for rankings, and blah blah blah...\n\nThe story isn't bad, but it really only serves as an excuse to move you through each of the rather linear mission areas.  Every species receives communication from a leader that sends them from objective to objective until the mission area is complete and you can move onto the next one.  The story environs allow you to experience the inside of a hive, a colony base, and an ancient Predator pyramid amongst ruins in a tropical jungle.  You'll encounter several variations of Xenomorphs,  Predators, and Androids - SPOILER:  They all want to kill you.\n\nAs each of the species have different abilities - the playstyle for each is completely different.  Xenomorphs can climb on almost all surfaces, leap at enemies (also vents), claw at enemies, whip them with their tail, and bite into their heads.  They can also "harvest" enemies by grabbing them and allowing a facehugger to attach.  Xenomorphs specialize in stealth and speed and to that end they can hide in vents, crawl through tight spaces, destroy lights which helps them hide in the dark, and hiss to lure enemies to their (tasty) demise.\n\nXenomorphs can see fine in the dark and they can see the auras of enemies (even through walls), so long as they are not too far away.  They can regenerate health, provided they aren't taking damage.  The Xenomorphs have the shortest (or quickest) campaign, it seemed, but also the most fun.\n\nThe Predators specialize in gadgets.  They can cloak which is good for disguising their presence from a distance, but they can't sneak up on humans from behind like Xenomorphs can, and they can be seen even while cloaked by the Xenomorphs, or if they get too close to humans and androids.  Stepping into water also decloaks the pred, as does interacting with elements in the game.  As the Predator campaign progresses they unlock (find) new weapons and an extra view style.  Predators have two razor claws on each forearm to melee with.  They can also get the shoulder cannon, prox mines, disc, and combi stick.\n\nThe shoulder cannon produces some splash damage, but a direct hit can kill most humans and xenos.  Using it causes you to decloak though and also drains the limited energy you have, which can only be replenished by finding power sources.  The prox mines can be dropped and remotely detonated, but to be honest, I never used them.  The disc is good for range attacks - you guide the disc with a laser sight and it returns.  A careful aim can take a head off.  The combi stick is the most lethal weapon in your arsenal, provided you aim carefully.  A direct hit will kill humans, xenos, and androids.  The Predator can also leap pretty high/far using a mechanic called "focus", which also helps point out things in the environment you might not otherwise see.\n\nThe Predator has a "normal" human vision mode, a heat vision mode (only good for spotting humans and androids), and sometime midway through the campaign or so you gain a "gray" vision mode that allows you to spot Xenomorphs (to the exclusion of other enemies).  The Predator also can zoom in from afar using any mode of vision.  They heal using shards - they can carry 3 at a time.  You feel the most badass as the Predator.\n\nHumans (Marines) have it the toughest.  They're an easy, doughy, more meltable target for the other species.  They have a motion tracker, sure, but it's really limited in it's usefulness.  They have a sidearm, but it's really not the weapon of choice when being swarmed by Xenos or charged by a Predator.  They can get the pulse rifle which fires bullets and has a limited capacity grenade launcher.  They can use a shotgun, which is very deadly at close range, and a sniper rifle that's deadly at long range.  I found the sniper rifle to be a pretty useless weapon - good for picking off still targets, but not the aliens.  The best part of the human arsenal is the smartgun, but you're limited on it's availability and ammo, and are forced to drop your main weapon when picking it up (humans can only carry two weapons aside from the sidearm).\n\nFor some reason the marines don't get the night vision they had in both the movie and the previous AVP games.  This to me is a sore spot.  They do get flares they can toss, but they are, at best, impractical.  While you can putter your way through the darker areas of the singleplayer campaign putting up with this limitation, it becomes a severe handicap in dark multiplayer games against the other two species.  The humans have 3 health bars.  They can regenerate health in a bar provided they aren't taking damage.  However, if a bar is completely emptied it doesn't regenerate.  In order to fully heal then they need to use a health stim - they can carry 3 at a time.  The human campaign felt the longest to me (probably had something to do with all the dying I did).\n\nControl-wise I had issues with all three species.  The controls are at times stiff, clumsy, non-intuitive, and downright frustrating.  Part of the problem, I think, is that the game was clearly designed for controller fondling console gamers first and foremost.  It explains the wanky mechanics, the constant handholding you sense as you play, the strictly linear flow of the missions, and the god-awful item hunt to unlock masturbatory achievements.  The idea is these are 3 species fighting for survival against one another, so why am I expected to waste time snooping around for stupid hidden items that serve neither the plot or your survival?\n\nThe Marine feels like his boots are made of lead.  He's slow, not particularly responsive, he can barely jump - he can't even crouch behind cover for blueberry muffin's sake!!!  WTH?  He can climb onto waist high crates and stuff, but there are only one or two places in the entire campaign where that's necessary.\n\nThe Xenomorphs are faster and more agile, but you will often find yourself stuck on surfaces struggling to get off, disoriented by the unpredictability of it's movement mechanics when going from one surface to another, or fighting to get things squarely into view so you can leap into, use an interactive element, or bite into some jerks head.\n\nThe Predator may fall somewhere between.  He's faster than humans, but not xenos, but he also can't crouch *sigh*.  He can leap high and far, but the mechanics in doing so is more complicated than it needed to be.\n\nMultiplayer is where this game should really shine and unfortunately it's a bust.  The game is heavily weighed against the Marines.  So, IF you can find a server to play on, all of the regulars will be either Aliens or Predators.  First off, the Predators and Xenomorphs can one-hit kill the Marines, and because both the Preds and the Xenos can leap long distances, move fast, and track you based on vision - you won't even know what happened half the time.  Remember, Marines don't get night vision, and the tracker is completely useless against opponents that can move so quick you're dead before you even register the blip.\n\nIf you're looking for an AVP universe game then this is decent, though I'd still recommend AVP Classic 2000 over this game.  To be honest, I'd recommend Alien Trilogy, Aliens:  Colonial Marines, and Alien: Isolation over this, but they don't have Predators *tear*.

Or so we could have hoped but unfortunately this is not as much a reboot of the extremely well made original as it an entirely new take on the franchise. Some features and concepts familiar to old players make a return but unfortunately the game only plays them lip-service and this new AvP game ends up feeling nothing like the original.\n\nThe AvP campaign takes place on a remote colony where Weyland-Yutani, in another instance of completely brain meltdown, finds a captured queen and immediately begins breeding aliens for the glory of scientific discovery, or something. As expected, the aliens get lose and start making a mess of things so the colonial marines get sent in to clear up the mess. Also a bunch of Predators show up because well, that's what they do.\n\nAll the campaigns share the same maps like in the original and they are simply approached from different angles. Unfortunately they are far more linear and closed off than in the original. There are very few vents for the alien to use and you only rarely have the option to skip killing someone.\n\nThe Marine campaign is obviously the one that has had the most effort put into it with plenty of voice-acting and even some audio diaries to be discovered around the complex that tells the story leading up to all hell breaking loose.\nMost of the Marine gameplay is more survival horror than straight up shooter with a few boss fights and "Hold the line!" scenarios to break up the mold every once in a while. Unfortunately both the survival and horror elements dissipate quite quickly, limited regeneration and being able to survive quite a few hits from the aliens make fighting them trivial and the biggest threat to you is killing one of them at close range and getting splashed with their acidic blood. All of the alien encounters are scripted and you are almost never surprised when they show up. Your one fight with Predators is easily forgotten and the only real challenge comes from Weyland's combat androids simply because they can one shot you.\n\nThe Alien campaign is somewhat more entertaining, with you stalking your prey and taking them out, one by one. The extremely linear maps and the low number of airducts available means this is nowhere near as well made as in the original however and you'll find that stealth is not quite as rewarding as it should be.\n\nThe Predator campaign however is where the game truly fails. Despite ostensibly being the strongest of the 3 species he depends almost 100% on stealth kills for half the game, barely being to survive a burst from a marine or a few stabs by an alien. The famed shoulder mounted energy launcher holds 2 shots before it has to be recharged. About half-way through the game however you will come across your combi-stick and never use another weapon again. It one shots everything and doesn't de-cloak you making the rest of the fighting trivial.\n\nThe multi-player is nice but unfortunately nobody plays it anymore and getting a game going requires an enormous amount of patience.\n\nAll in all, Aliens Vs. Predator 2010 is a classic example of a game that takes it's roots from a great old game but doesn't understand any of the concepts it's trying to use and in the end it's not much more than a mediocre mess.","March 8, 2013","true","370.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightmare8906/recommended/10680/","nightmare8906","NIGHTMARE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightmare8906/","6 products in account","The highly acclaimed British developer Rebellion is striving to scare the hell out of you again with the new Aliens Vs Predator game. Re-capturing the pulse pounding game play from the original PC gaming classic, players once again get to play three different campaigns from three different perspectives. Aliens Vs Predator is a thrilling gaming experience no matter what part of the campaign you play. The clash this time around takes place on the deep space frontier world being colonized by humans. There on the the colony on a far off planet an ancient pyramid is found. Of course scientist and archaeologists can't help but go exploring this historic find. This of course triggers the ultimate confrontation between Colonial Marines, Aliens and the Predators.\n\nThe single player of the game is a rather unique playing experience.You can play any of the three species, each with strengths and weaknesses. The Colonial Marines, while rather fragile, they have a heck of a lot of fire power. The Predator has it's stealth and cloaking device, and the Aliens have the claws, the speed and numbers. Each character type requires a different skill to play to it's full potential. It all comes down to the skill of the individual players really.\n\nThe Colonial Marine makes due with the human technologies, from pulse rifles and pistols and auto turrets to motion trackers. The over all feel of survival horror and thrill when dozens of Aliens start clambering at you from every possible angle is exhilarating. Moving along through the darkness with only your beam of light illuminating small portions of an area is such a thrill.\n\nThe Predator is pretty awesome to play,I mean really who did not long for a game with this character after seeing the films? All the Predator equipment is at your disposal here, from the personal cloaking device which aids you in your stealthy approach to human targets, on to the unique ability to target a Marine and then throw a recorded mish mash of a voice to a point where the target will go investigate. This is perfect for luring target's out of a much more dangerous group. They will not fall for this tactic though if they are on alert. Predator also has it's view modes, each species has a special view mode that can spot them best. For instance if the player is in a view mode for hunting Marines, they have to take care because the Aliens are next to invisible in that mode. Getting around as the Predator is achieved by the standard running around...but what's fun is that the Predator has a focus jump mode - a circle representation of where you can jump to shows up, then hitting the right button and off you go. One would think the Predator would be the be all end all power player of this game, but there are things in place that balance it out pretty well. Some of the Predator's weapons have to be recharged, so just blasting away with the shoulder mounted plasma cannon is not advised.\n\nPlaying the Alien campaign the player is the creature that the scientist named “Six” - a poor captured Alien. The Wayland - Yutani company has some special plans for Six, oh the greed and nastiness of this company, who is the real monster here? Playing as an Alien requires a lot of tactical skill to fully utilize this character types natural defensive and attack capabilities. Claws, teeth and spiked tail and special senses. Sort of a natural enhanced sense mode that aids in seeing the prey. Blending with the darkness and easing in on a target is what the Alien does, or can attack in great numbers. Of course, the Alien can run along walls and ceiling, making it a very cool character to control indeed. As noted, darkness is your friend so, the Alien can also break light emanating sources, to plunge an area into darkness. Getting in close and personal is what the Alien does best. It's a good balance of character abilities and environment based survival abilities.\n\nOther than the atmospheric single player campaigns there are several different multi player matches to be had in the game and all of them have something different to offer:\n\nDEATH MATCH: A no brainer free for all, shoot everything that moves and survive to the end. Get the most kills in the set time limit, or get the target score before anyone else in the game.\n\nSPECIES TEAM DEATH MATCH: Death match, only this time with teams. Marines, Vs Aliens,Vs Predator's. Get the most kills within the set time limit or reach the target score before any of the other teams.\n\nMIXED SPECIES TEAM DEATH MATCH: Yup another death match. Get the most kills in the set time limit, or get the target score before anyone else in the game.\n\nINFESTATION: Massive mayhem, sort of like zombie tag in many respects. One player starts out as an Alien. All the others are Marines, when a Marine is killed they come back in the game as another Alien. So as the name implies it's a race to stay alive and try not to be over whelmed, though being the last Marine standing in one of these matches is a thrill fest.\n\nPREDATOR HUNT: Oh what fun, One player is selected as the Predator, sort of like king of the hill but not. Who ever kills the Predator get's to play as the Predator. Pretty fun all around.\n\nDOMINATION: Two teams fight it out for control points all around the level. Keep a Control point and get a steady stream of points flowing in. Getting more Control Points and the team get more score.\n\nSURVIVOR: The title says it all, four players enter the game and must fend off waves and waves of Aliens.\n\nOver all Aliens Vs Predator has succeeded in bringing to the table so much newness with an old concept. It just does not get old anytime soon in it's playability.","September 26, 2013","true","950.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","1"

This game releashed in 2010 beats out alien colonial mariens which was releashed 2013. Youd think that three years would help improve the technology of graphics, story creativity, etc well in this case the 2006 game took the cake. having already played the first bit of the Marine campaign i can honsetly say it is the better of the two games. Im excited to play as a Xeno and predator soon. Cant wait to see how the stories come together in the end. im just really dissapointed with sega and gearbox having not created the master piece they promised with Aliens colonial mariens. Now with the design of the weapons and set pieces we see some differences because of copy right laws and so forth. Aliens CM was suppose to be as perfect and true to the film because they recieved rights to use audio, original set design to help produce the most authentic Alien game. It was suppose to have elements from the Second Alien game to help give you that feel of being there in the Alien universe but i just couldnt feel that when distracted with the crappy mechanics, gameplay, story etc within the game.

Wish online play was still an option, but that community trailed off long ago.  This is still worth owning for the campaign mode.\nAlso, finishing moves are always fun to perform and witness!

The original had wonderful atmosphere but I never enjoyed the gameplay, nominally because it had poor story but in truth because it so cheerfully kicked my ♥♥♥. The 2001 sequel had a stronger (if somewhat convoluted) story and I appreciated the gameplay more (read: it was easier) but -aside from a precious few moments- lacked the terrifying atmosphere that made the franchise so memorable. And what of the 2010 reboot?\n\nLike the previous games, the series divides itself into three campaigns; one for each species (Human, Predator and Alien). The human campaign was suitably terrifying; I was vulnerable prey running from deadly and hungry non-terrestrial life. Unfortunately, my deadly array of weaponry even the odds somewhat, minimizing the fear... at least until ammo started to run low. But it was by far the best of the three campaigns.\n\nThe Alien and Predator campaigns were less satisfying; they were just too deadly to provide much of a challenge.  All three of the campaigns also suffered from very linear levels, although this was less obvious with the Aliens and Predators, who could leap across wide areas with ease, which opened up the maps somewhat; the Humans were limited to tight corridors. The story was improved over the 1999 game but was poorly paced and ended predictably. And the game was incredibly short; about two hours per campaign.\n\nBut for all its shortcomings, the old-school gameplay of Aliens vs Predator was a welcome change of pace. It might not have "wowed" me, but neither did it entirely disappoint. It may have been run-of-the-mill as far as design, but it used the iconic franchise well and it was entertaining to boot.\n\nAvP 2010 got poor marks because it was constantly compared to its eleven-year old predecessor (a game which I did not care for); the 2010 edition is more akin to a modern corridor shooter like Call of Duty than the almost deathmatch-like first game. AVP 2010 is much more bound by its story and atmosphere, resulting in a more-tightly paced and scripted experience. Maybe this costs the game in replayability and unpredictability but it is something I found much more entertaining.\n\n","November 27, 2013","true","34.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The 2001 sequel had a stronger (if somewhat convoluted) story and I appreciated the gameplay more (read: it was easier) but -aside from a precious few moments- lacked the terrifying atmosphere that made the franchise so memorable. And what of the 2010 reboot?\n\nLike the previous games, the series divides itself into three campaigns; one for each species (Human, Predator and Alien). The human campaign was suitably terrifying; I was vulnerable prey running from deadly and hungry non-terrestrial life. Unfortunately, my deadly array of weaponry even the odds somewhat, minimizing the fear... at least until ammo started to run low. But it was by far the best of the three campaigns.\n\nThe Alien and Predator campaigns were less satisfying; they were just too deadly to provide much of a challenge.  All three of the campaigns also suffered from very linear levels, although this was less obvious with the Aliens and Predators, who could leap across wide areas with ease, which opened up the maps somewhat; the Humans were limited to tight corridors. The story was improved over the 1999 game but was poorly paced and ended predictably. And the game was incredibly short; about two hours per campaign.\n\nBut for all its shortcomings, the old-school gameplay of Aliens vs Predator was a welcome change of pace. It might not have "wowed" me, but neither did it entirely disappoint. It may have been run-of-the-mill as far as design, but it used the iconic franchise well and it was entertaining to boot.\n\nAvP 2010 got poor marks because it was constantly compared to its eleven-year old predecessor (a game which I did not care for); the 2010 edition is more akin to a modern corridor shooter like Call of Duty than the almost deathmatch-like first game. AVP 2010 is much more bound by its story and atmosphere, resulting in a more-tightly paced and scripted experience. Maybe this costs the game in replayability and unpredictability but it is something I found much more entertaining.\n\n","November 27, 2013","true","34.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Story mode offers three different characters to show you the overall plot from a different viewpoint; the rookie Marine handles like a FPS hero against the Xenomorphs, Alien experiment '6' strikes from the shadows to sow panic amongst the humans, and the young Predator hunter is a mix of stealth and brutal offense stalking both races. Completing every campaign will take you through almost all of the same levels, each with differing outcomes, but they all lead to a showdown and tease the same reveal at the end of the game. However, the inclusion of hidden collectibles for each race doesn't add much to the gameplay, except for the Marine. Imagine the audio-logs from Dead Space, but not as great (IMO, at least).","December 28, 2011","true","12.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There is even a map /labirinth where the wals constantly move and sometimes kill you.\n\n\nI recommend beieng an alien if you like too be sneaky-assasin like and enjoy trolling/giving people heart attacks, every time i sneak up un a marine i imagine i scared them to death >:), predator is a more up-in-yo-face type of class, it has some one shot weopons lieing around the map and can jump stupidly high, i recommend beieng a predator if you like meleeing someone to death and sometimes just blast someone to hell with a laser, and last (and honestly least) marine, i recommend marine for people who like hanging back, torching people with flamethrowers, shotgun and gun alike. warning though, this IS the easyest class too play, but, the NR1. class to pick upon, if you choose this class, rage awaits you.\n\n\nDo i  reccomend this game, HELL YES, for +- 15 euros this game is like finding a lump of gold the size of, lemme think, an  ELEPHANT this game might look old but the grafics are stunning and the atmoshere is terrefieing and absolutely awesome at the same time and everything is extremely polished.","January 17, 2015","true","10.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I won this game in an offsite and I have to say, I was sort of curious about it.  Getting it free was a bonus.  There isn't much in the way of gameplay.  All three campaigns can be wrapped up quite quickly, but I still rate things like movies.  If I'm willing to spend $15 for 1.5 to 2 hrs of entertainment, I shouldn't be upset for the same level of entertainment from a game.  (Then again, I'm a cheapskate and I only do matinee for $5.50).  Even if you are a cheapskate like me, I had fun for 5 hrs, so that would translate to $27.50.

Humans might seem like they're at a disadvantage but actually if you use them right (e.g block then shoot the heck outta it) then you'll get big scores. Aliens are at the top of behind E kills (grapple kills which you cant escape from) which can be annoying but since the Aliens are'nt as good in open melee they kinda have to rely on it. Now the Predators they for me are the most fun race to play as they can also perform E kills from behind but why would anyone want to do that sure some cool animations come from it but the best ones come from the front after wounding your enemy so much they cant fight back also they get cool gear like the plasma mine, combi stick and even the plasma cannon which is a bit op. So what im trying to say it this game is great and you should absouletly get this whenever you have enough money.

All three compaigns were relatively fun and varied, but hampered by some control and gameplay errors. As other reviewers have realized, the marine campaign has the most effort. Only a few problems with them,  such as the inability to switch guns by rolling the mouse. You have to press numbers, and I died countless times while trying to switch in the heat of the battle and pressing the wrong button because I didn't know which gun was 2 or 3. There is also no aim button, and a crouch isn't present either, both dumb exclusions. The campaign is relatively long, if forgettable and muddled. The Alien campaign is super short and the predator is relatively short. The jumping to new ground button with the predator doesn't really work, and is the same button for locking on to attack someone. This is a dumb idea and you usually do the one you aren't trying to.","August 13, 2012","true","15.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","4"

Spent 1 hour chasing my own tail 10/10.\n___________________________\n\nAn incredibly underrated game which did not deserve the hate it got because it was not the clone of a 10+ years old game that played like Doom on speed or because of a few graphical glitches which were quickly patched after the game came out. And let's not forget people whining about the lack of crouch for the Marine or Predator (seems fair to rate a game 1/10 if it doesn't have the one feature you want).\n\nAs many of the people here, I was really into AvP since the first comics were published and I played pretty much every single game ever made for it (from the capcom arcades up to the transition to PC and consoles) and now even own the AvP boardgame. So you can trust me when I say "I know what AvP is about, and I have seen what games can do for it".\n\nEach game brings its own unique ideas to the franchise, just as AvP2010 did, so rather than listing all the things you can do in this game (which you can easily read from other reviews), I am going to post what new ideas and moods the game brings.\n\nUnlike its predecessors, you do not feel like your character is an helium balloon sliding on oil, they finally feel like they have WEIGHT and a real presence within the world (with being able to look at your own body).\nRunning around mindlessly and shooting is not how you play it, with predator is all about being Stealthy and knowing your surroundings, finding the right spots and switch, with the Marine is about aim and paying attention to details studying your opponents behaviours, with the Alien is about hiding, testing the waters, waiting for opportunities and taking chances. The fact that a few environments are interactive, forces you to change your strategy with interesting results.\n\nI often find that people who get annoyed at the multiplayer of this game are those who expect it to play like a game of Team Fortress, I for one am happy it plays NOTHING like it, and I wouldn't if it was as frantic, chaotic and "floaty" as that game. I like that I have a sense of understanding of what is happening around me.\n\nTo this day, it is a shame this game does not have a sequel because AvP2010 is the game who came closest to understanding what the AvP franchise are all about.","July 2, 2015","true","60.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

There is also a major plot hole that messes with the entire predator story line. You see in the second mission of the predator you visit the hive and it has already been burned down. Here is where a lot of confusion comes in, as you see by the end of the aliens missions aliens cannot live/function without a queen YET you spend all the predator missions fighting aliens who have NO queen which creates not only a paradox but also a massive plot hole.\nThe next problem is the humans, not just the marines but all of them. They all do stupid stuff and say "JEE I WONDER WHAT CAN GO WRONG?" and these idiots always end up dead. The best example is the distraction function of the predator "oh whats that? all my squad is dead? well even though i know this for a fact i'm going to walk to where i heard voices" see the idiocy in this? The stupidity is unbearable if you are trying to play as a marine because the AI for the marines is that of a very stupid 2 year old. Not to mention anyone who has ever tried to harness the power of xenomorphs gets stupider and more moronic each time.\nOn a gameplay level this game holds up, except the xenomorph because that can be disorienting but it will never be as bad as classic 2000. The predator is very fun to play as but despite how bad the marine AI is they can turn you from a big bad murder machine to a pile of swiss cheese in no time. Which would have to be another problem for me, the guns are not as powerful when you use them, but when any other marine uses the guns they tear you apart. The reason i worded it as "tear you apart" is because they cannot do anything when you play as a marine, but the moment you switch to alien or predator they shoot up some kind of meth and become super man.\nThis AVP game is also a huge improvment from the classic 2000 in many ways. If you tried playing AVP 2000 and found it too confusing, this game is dumbed down and easier to play for the most part. Not to mention that there are HUDS that give you proper directions instead of "go find the switch that i won't tell you exactly where it is, but i can give you an estimation of about where it might be." making it easier to get about the place.\nOver all this game is worth buying and playing through a few times. It has only a small handfull of bugs that never got out of hand or even bothered me that much, the AI is not to bad for the most part, and it is fun to play as the Alien and Predator if you love having superiority and it's fun to play the marines if you like the horror feel. This game lands an 8/10 on my personal rating.","October 26, 2014","true","7.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Spent 1 hour chasing my own tail 10/10.\n___________________________\n\nAn incredibly underrated game which did not deserve the hate it got because it was not the clone of a 10+ years old game that played like Doom on speed or because of a few graphical glitches which were quickly patched after the game came out. And let's not forget people whining about the lack of crouch for the Marine or Predator (seems fair to rate a game 1/10 if it doesn't have the one feature you want).\n\nAs many of the people here, I was really into AvP since the first comics were published and I played pretty much every single game ever made for it (from the capcom arcades up to the transition to PC and consoles) and now even own the AvP boardgame. So you can trust me when I say "I know what AvP is about, and I have seen what games can do for it".\n\nEach game brings its own unique ideas to the franchise, just as AvP2010 did, so rather than listing all the things you can do in this game (which you can easily read from other reviews), I am going to post what new ideas and moods the game brings.\n\nUnlike its predecessors, you do not feel like your character is an helium balloon sliding on oil, they finally feel like they have WEIGHT and a real presence within the world (with being able to look at your own body).\nRunning around mindlessly and shooting is not how you play it, with predator is all about being Stealthy and knowing your surroundings, finding the right spots and switch, with the Marine is about aim and paying attention to details studying your opponents behaviours, with the Alien is about hiding, testing the waters, waiting for opportunities and taking chances. The fact that a few environments are interactive, forces you to change your strategy with interesting results.\n\nI often find that people who get annoyed at the multiplayer of this game are those who expect it to play like a game of Team Fortress, I for one am happy it plays NOTHING like it, and I wouldn't if it was as frantic, chaotic and "floaty" as that game. I like that I have a sense of understanding of what is happening around me.\n\nTo this day, it is a shame this game does not have a sequel because AvP2010 is the game who came closest to understanding what the AvP franchise are all about.","July 2, 2015","true","60.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

All three compaigns were relatively fun and varied, but hampered by some control and gameplay errors. As other reviewers have realized, the marine campaign has the most effort. Only a few problems with them,  such as the inability to switch guns by rolling the mouse. You have to press numbers, and I died countless times while trying to switch in the heat of the battle and pressing the wrong button because I didn't know which gun was 2 or 3. There is also no aim button, and a crouch isn't present either, both dumb exclusions. The campaign is relatively long, if forgettable and muddled. The Alien campaign is super short and the predator is relatively short. The jumping to new ground button with the predator doesn't really work, and is the same button for locking on to attack someone. This is a dumb idea and you usually do the one you aren't trying to.","August 13, 2012","true","15.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","4"

Either sneaking up on an enemy, and pressing E on their back, or stunning them enough to do it from the front, you execute one of many satisfying brutal kills!

The Alien AI is also pretty stupid, they run directly towards you or they run up a wall only to jump back down again.\n\nMarine Campaign\nThe Marine campaign consists of walking around empty corridors and reaching marines moments after they die proving that the AI is so unbelievably stupid that the developers have to kill them all off using scripted events, there's no point going into detail about the Marine campaign because its really really generic. If you were looking for a Colonial Marines Squad experience you're out of luck because you spend the entire campaign on your own. Also a fellow Marine called Tequila talks into your ear for most of the game and she will annoy the hell out of you.\n\nAlien Campaign\nThe Alien Campaign starts off quite promising but quickly goes downs hill when you meet the mentally challenged Marines who have no knowledge of each others existence, so you spend the entire campaign scuttling about killing off Marines one by one until the game tells you that you've won.\n\nPredator Campaign\nThe Predator Campaign is really really boring, you simply jump about killing off mentally challenged Marines and having the occasional fight against a group of Aliens using disorientating melee attacks.\n\nMultiplayer\nThe multiplayer is a tiny tiny tiny little bit better than the singleplayer but not something I would pay money for. The multiplayer maps are really small and most of them are recycled from the singleplayer. The multiplayer is almost dead and the currently being attacked by hackers.\n\nOverall\nI can't believe that people are calling this the best game ever because its awful compared to its predecessor Alien vs Predator 2. If you want a real AvP experience then go play Alien vs Predator 2 because its a fantastic game that has stood the test of time.\n\nStill better than Aliens: Colonial Marines.","February 27","false","62.4"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","9","19","2","0"

You have different modes to play everything from Survival(which is very horroresque), TDM, DM, etc.. and you have so many unique maps to play. And, you can play from any of the Aliens,Predators,Marines..all with there own unique weapons and skills.\n\nI highly recommend this game..","December 26, 2013","true","22.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Although 15.00 is expensive considering a 2009 game but this is a great idea for this game. I have been a big fan of AVP since i was a kid i went to the remake of the movie on realease I GOT IN AND I WAS ONLY LIKE 11. I wish they made a second game as  no one plays online anymore and if they do you cant find games because of the  online system. But guys you have to give it credirt as it was made back in 09. I think if they expanded the game on a new version they would sell and balence alien a bit more  and expand preditor weaponds and new species of Alien rather then just zenomorph. i would give this game a 8/10 for its not great MP search engine and the campaign was like you were playing the same mission as a diffrent species but high marks for a great MP idea.","April 5, 2014","true","16.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","5","11","2","0"

The game just has you run waypoint to waypoint killing dozens of ailens along the way.\nThe aliens don't feel scary or difficult, rather, it's just a difficulty factor based on how many shotgun shells I have left.\nThe game basically plays like a bad version of Doom 3 or even Dead Space\nThe guns are uninteresting.

I finished the Alien campaign in less than 2 hours. I've finished the Alien campaign and will add more stuff when I finish the Predator and Human campaigns. This felt like a cheap way to mooch off the AvP franchise name without putting in any effort to create a game. 6 hours to finish 3 campaigns who reuse the same exact maps is just too fast.\n\nBought it on the Steam Sale for $7.50.\n\nPROS\n1. Interesting Franchise\nI mean it's AvP. There are a lot of interesting weapons and technology in the lore.\n\nCONS\n1. Short Campaign\nWay too short.\n\n2. Uninteresting Campaign\nThe campaign is pretty uninteresting compared to AvP 2. In AvP 2, you actually start off as a Facehugger having to find your first victim, followed by being a Chestburster and feeding on dogs then finally ending off as a Xenomorph. This just starts off as the Alien doing repetitive actions.\n\nPress E to do an overly complex action before you kill the creature.\n\n3. Alien Movement\nClunky to say the least. You have to keep holding down Mouse 3 in order to run around smoothly. The view is also limited as you can't turn 360 to see your surroundings when you're hiding on top.\n\n4. View\nNo more Alien pheromone view. It's just normal mode with enemies highlighted Red, Blue and Yellow. You kill Red and Blues and harvest Yellows and they have to be in your line of sight.\n\n5. Enemies\n♥♥♥♥ poor variety. Only a machine gunner and a flame thrower for human varieties. Predators were seriously weak, a jump attack and a heavy attack, rinse repeat.\n\n6. Human Weapons\nA Rifle with a grenade launcher, a flamethrower, a shotgun, a sniper rifle, a pistol and a smart gun. Where's the rocket launcher, plasma rifle, rail gun and your hand grenade?\n\n7. Predator Weapons\nWhat happened to the Crossbow to rip heads off?\nWhy is the spinning disc so weak? It's like a toy ball.\nWhere is the multi-targetting system in infra-red?\nHow did the Predator staff become so strong and teleport back into your hands after each attack?","October 11, 2015","false","6.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

I've beaten all the campaigns once on normal and once on hard and it was not even challenging. I think the multiplayer is where the challenge is and tbh if you are new to the multi aspect prepare to get pawned for a while. So far in 19 hours I've done everything this game has to offer and then a little. The multiplayer is a bit repetitive and the final fights of the game are somewhat lack luster. The build up to that point is pretty good though. I am down voting it because while the campaign can be a lot of fun and the graphics and sound are great it simply offers too liittle and I feel that a good title should be able to give me more than 19 hours of game time.","May 19","false","19.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","9"

I am a fan of the Alien-license (not a hardcore one that would notice plot inconsistencies, mind you) and picked this up on a Steam sale, and I just don't feel like playing any more of it. For reference, I only beat the Marine campaign and some of the Predator campaign so far, and I don't think I'll go and beat both that and the Alien campaign any time soon. Each campaign seems like it'll last you about 2-3 hours, considering I beat the Marine one in about 2 hours and felt like I got halfway through the Predator one.\n\nIts not that I feel that I didn't get my money's worth with Aliens vs Predator (I paid, like, five dollars for it), but I think its not something you should get excited about playing. It works, the environments can be pretty, and it does feel like an Alien game, but the scenarios are bland and not very exciting, and the weapons feel like toys and aren't very satisfying to kill enemies with.\n\nA linear, story-driven FPS needs more than just enemies that you point and shoot at. This genre requires satisfying gunplay mechanics and scenarios that give you an adrenaline rush, or make you feel tense. There have to be challenging rooms filled with enemies that come out of every corner, and you should feel awesome once you overcome that challenge!\n\nAliens vs Predator is so unexciting that even dying on harder difficulties didn't get me frustrated or angry - I just didn't care enough. At first I thought it was because I was playing the Marine campaign, but the few minutes I played of the Predator campaign were even worse. Again, its not that the game is awful or unplayable, but there are so many other story-driven FPS games that play better. Not every game can be Half-Life, Bioshock or Wolfenstein: The New Order, but a game this mediocre just isn't fun to play nowadays.","November 30, 2015","false","3.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

So how does this 2010 reboot fare?\n\nSTORY: Barebones.\n\nAll 3 races share the same storyline, so mostly it's just perspective and gameplay that changes. There's some planet, another Weyland android tries to capture aliens to get their technology. Go kill each other. Yeah, story's pretty weak.\n\nLEVEL DESIGN: Good variety but reused a lot.\n\nMost of the maps will be the exact same for all 3 campaigns, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Each level is actually designed to be navigated in different ways depending on your species: the Aliens will go around walls and through vents, the Predators will hop across distances and heights, while Humans will walk horizontally.\n\nPREDATOR GAMEPLAY: Fun, but not many combat options.\n\nYou wish you could toy with your prey more, but the game encourages you to go fist-to-fist. You only get the diskus and the combistick (which can only be thrown) very late in the game, so most of the time, you're just trying to stealth and sneak behind for a quick dramatic kill. It also sucks that you get UNLIMITED CLOAKING, which takes away the suspense of running out of power at exactly the last second.\n\nMARINE GAMEPLAY: Good atmosphere, but few weapons.\n\nI love the level where you try to escape from a Night Club. You never see this in a space horror game: you're the last survivor trying to get out of a failed rescue mission, and then ... the music blasts, so you're fighting off hordes of aliens while dancing to the music. Unfortunately, you're stuck using the very basic autorifle or pistol most of the time, with the shotgun, flamethrower, and smartgun making an extrance very late in the game.\n\nALIENS GAMEPLAY: Short, and feels weak.\n\nYou don't have the "Press E for pounce" anymore. Instead, you have to hold SHIFT and target an enemy in order to leap onto them. Attacks also feel clunky, and not fluid. You only play as a regular alien drone, never a facehugger, praetorian, or predalien. I really thought you'd play as a predalien, but no.\n\nOVERALL: Not bad, but nothing special.\n\nRating: 6/10.","December 19, 2013","true","13.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Why do i say not buy it? Because the online is DEAD. There is no one in ranked or player matches, i was the only one searching for a game so don't waste your money on the DLC unless you plan on doing the survivor maps with friends.\n\nOverall:\n\nPretty good game besides there being no one playing online so do not buy it at the price its at now, wait for a sale because all your getting is the campaign. Story alone is amazing and i got a good amount of hours out of it, you can go back and play on a harder difficulty if you want or get the achievements which i plan on doing later.","December 14, 2014","true","11.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Marines are also way too slow and have hardly any health and all characters constantly lose their balance when melee, making it very hard to get back up or have a fighting chance. SEGA does not update or even fixes any of the game's issues. And the game lags horribly, and almost unplayable due to how much lag the servers have. Steam also does nothing to get rid of cheaters so this gets a bad score and not reccomended.\n\nIF THIS IS ON SALE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! IF IT IS AT $3 DO NOT. EVEN IF THE GAME IS GIVEN AS A GIFT OR IS FREE STAY AWAY FROM IT! UNLESS STEAM OR SEGA WANT TO FIX THE GAME'S PROBLEMS THEN MAYBE THE GAME IS WORTH A FEW CENTS.","December 26, 2015","false","25.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But got it in 30 mins.\nAs "Aliens" yet you only play as one, hold down Q, shift, mouse wheel and hit space bar occasionally, oh gawd what have I done, your screen goes around and around like a mad man getting drunk and high at a rave.\nBut its fun.\nKilling animations are good, but some are quick and some are slow (more than once getting me killed)\n\nOverall if you like either Alien series or Predator Series its a must buy, wanted to get it while I was young (back in 2010) on PS3 but not worth/underage was reminded about it whe it popped up on sale. I do not regret, then again it was only £2.49? But yeah I recommend this game.","July 19, 2015","true","9.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","6"

I'd even go so far as to say that the games are better than the "Alien" "Predator" movies themselves. Of the three races, however, the Xenomorph (my favorite) lost the most in this updated version. It's more easily  countered by the Colonial Marine and the Predator, and since it only has melee options for combat, you have to get your head around playing in a more conservative style as the Xenomorph.\nOn the plus side, the graphics are a huge improvement over the first "Aliens vs. Predator", and the eye-candy is nothing to discount. I would definitely recommend the single-player campaigns, especially as an introduction to the controls, mastery of which you'll definitely need for multiplayer. The Colonial Marine campaign was especially well-done in terms of instilling a sense of fear and anxiety for your Marine's safety.","August 3, 2011","true","86.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

It's a shame there is no queen boss fight in survival, though. If Rebellion get back into improving this game, I believe I'll play it more often.","March 23, 2015","true","29.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
