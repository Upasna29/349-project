You can choose to play as 5 different characters, all with their own phrases and strengths, as you battle through well crafted if unoptimised levels. Shoot walls and watch bits flake off. Shoot enemies and watch blood spew everywhere. Battle your way through historically accurate levels as you confront intelligent enemies. They have a great shot, can move quickly, will dodge your attacks and will even steal your weapons off of you and TRAP YOU IN A NET.\n\nIt's all good fun and there is a lot of replayability in the form of achievements and secret areas to find. It's the most full-on FPS game since Serious Sam (which itself is very serious) and really deserves to be played. The original game came out in the mid 90's and included God mode, Dog mode, spinning blades and bouncing platforms, all of which make a return in this game.\n\nBetter still, the people who have made this game are CRAZY. They've replied ALL IN CAPS to my fanboyish messages on youtube, to people on the forums and generally just don't seem to give a damn about how respectable companies are meant to behave. They are what would happen if this game made love to ITSELF and produced Danish babies. At the moment they're hosting live streams every Saturday where you can see for yourself just how serious they all are!\n\nDo them a favour and buy this game. It's cheap and will most likely give you more fun than the more mainstream shooters. This sort of SERIOUS game needs to be encouraged. Long live the 90's!","November 25, 2013","true","8.4"," 135 of 180 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","135","180","0","10"

A title fondly recalled in memories of the few being remade in UE3 is enough to make even the most cynical player dream of a return of the fast-paced, chaotic times of FPS yore.\n\nMade after the now toxic Duke Nukem Forever licence was taken away, ROTT is obviously made by a team with fond memories of the original. In fact, it's probably a little too fond. As you progress further and further through the game, you realise core gameplay has changed very little in the almost twenty years since the first game was released. Sure, rocket jumping is a breeze, now, and it even has mouselook like all the kids are talking about. But with a tedious array of enemies that almost exclusively barrel at you with hitscan rifles that even the swiftest player is bound to be scraped by, it's less of a ballet of surreal ultraviolence and turns too closely into a frantic porridge hunt or, worse, a slow, careful shooter that rewards careful, slow approach to situations than maneuverability and split second twitch aiming.\n\nNothing has been learned in all this time from the evolution of the genre, whichever way you look it - It does not have the interesting array of weaponry or diverse cast of monsters that Doom has to constantly challenge you, nor does it have leaning or cover that a more modern, "tactical" shooter would encourage. It sits in the middle of both of these design philosophies as it once was all that time ago. But it can't rest on its laurels after all this time when the original simply wasn't considered particularly good. Its infamy came from its explicit violence, gore, and sense of humour, the latter of which has been replaced with painfully unfunny toilet humour and even more referential and internet meme humour (Writers everywhere, please, if you're reading this, can we have some good, original comedy, please?).\n\nAnd even if you are a die-hard fan of the original, believing it is gameplay perfection, you'll find it difficult to still justify the purchase of this when the game is technically flawed in too many ways to count. Performance issues, bugs, map clipping errors, and technical shortcomings (You cannot rebind the weapon keys, half of your keyboard is likely not to work with binds, and you cannot turn off the mouse acceleration in the game, you need to edit a .ini file for this - In 2013, this is inexcusable!). With an apparently two programmers on a team of fifty artists, it's obvious where the emphasis on design was here, and if your technical foundation is not adequate, the content in it is wasted. If you must bring back a game from the past as close to the original as possible, you simply need more than pretty graphics and a 3D environment to justify its existence when even basic features and options do not exist or are broken.\n\nI want to love this game. It's built with passion and a clear hatred of how FPS games have forgotten their roots. But to be so aloof about your own darling harms its credibility and place on the stage - There is nothing wrong with an obnoxious plotline and setting that still takes itself seriously, without hiding behind humour and ironic, meta-humour. And perhaps the developers need to be honest with themselves: Why make a throwback title that refuses to change anything about the core gameplay, when the original was sub-par? Maybe ROTT94 should have been left in the past as a stepping stone to where we are now, and a more respectable example of how arena FPS can hold strong in modern times. Maybe we could, dare I say... come up with something original, instead of tying ourselves to dated ideas that fog the timeless ones?","August 5, 2013","false","4.3"," 143 of 196 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","143","196","0","4"

Besides Bioshock Infinite (yes I loved the gameplay, deal with it...) and Modern Warfare 2 (I don't even know... so don't ask) and like 3 or 4 more, it's Rise of the Triad that enters this rare list of mine!\nIt's 14€ title that is a remake of the original ROTT back in 1994 (?) which I never played to be honest. This one seems to be more...colorful than the original so I've been told, but it's not the color pallet that really matters here (though it's somewhat colorful, except in the indoor sequences which are 80% of the game...), it's the gameplay:\n-It's superb! It's just simple, fast paced, rocket jumping fun, with a sprinkle of ludicrous gibs (yes you can actually get *LUDICROUS GIBS*! By gibbing many enemies at the same time with a rocket weapon, this will result in a pair of eyeballs smash into your screen alongside a big spew of blood and other body parts (including a lovely middle finger)).\nBesides being fast-paced, it's just basic shooting! Rather than taking cover, the game rewards moving fast and strafing to avoid enemy fire, while hunting for secrets (which are very nicely hidden *looks at Hard Reset and Shadow Warrior '13*) that are very helpful along your journey, as not only they are a must find to 100% every level, but also give the best guns in order to help you take out the bosses which are quite tough.\nGameplay is pretty basic but it's so much fun! You have 3 bullet weapons (the single pistol, the dual pistols and the MP40 SMG) which all have infinite ammo and do not need any reloading whatsoever. And while this sounds like you can just hold LMB until the game finishes, you will not want to do that because the bullet weapons don't do all that much damage, and even some enemies are immune to bullets (the robots come to mind).\nYou have then the rocket weapons (and new patched Shotgun (or Dommstick), which doesn't make much sense, but it's quite amazing and feel like a Dommstick for real!) which have limited ammo but are avaliable pretty much everywhere so that you (pretty much) never run out of rockets.\nLike I said, extremely basic gameplay but it's so fun to gib everything and the guns do feel very powerful (the Split Missile feels just, epic!) and that's what really makes the game so replayable in my opinion.\nMoving to the story, it's non-existant (guys, it's a 90's remake ^^) or at least, pretty much non-existant, since you get introduced into it at the start of the game, where you are a HUNT team member (some special forces task force of extreme forces against other forces of enemy force) that go into an Island filled with suspiciously active triads and you must uncover what kind of ♥♥♥♥ they are doing!\nAfter the starting cutscene (it's a comic book page flip btw) you get no more story indications except this: "If it moves, kill it!"\nThe end is...weird, it seems like Interceptor (the developers) will release Single Player DLC (paid or free I have no idea). Maybe they won't, who knows, I haven't seen any SP extras (except 1.4's Shotgun) since the game's release which was almost a year ago!\nMoving on, audio is fine. All weapons sound great, interactions sound great as well (picking up the coins, jum pads making that distinctive sound, etc.) but the voice acting is very cheesy and poor, but it seems like in was on purpose, like on that B-movie "so bad it's good" type of voice-overs. Even the enemies, like Big John on E2L1 which sounds like a poor impersonation of Arnold Schwarzenegger, and it was quite funny.\nGraphically the game is mediocre. It doesn't look fully realistic, it looks a bit (just a smidge) cartoony and it sets well the mood of the game. I must comment on the gibs which look absolutely terrible, and that is a bad thing since this game is all about the *ludicrous gibs*! Most of them look very poor (the torso gib looks decent).\nI do have some issues with the game, and they aren't slight ones:\nThe Performance is terrible! The game doesn't look anywhere impressive to bring my PC to it's knees! The game is (like I said) decent at best when maxed out! And yet! I get most of the time 45 FPS, though it may go up to 65 or even 70 but that is quite far and between. Sometimes it drops to 23 FPS when there's "too much on the screen" and when I mean "too much" I mean "not that much", so the performance is really bad overall, though I must admit it was way worse back a few months ago! A game this fast paced is almost unforgivable for the performance to be this bad! Though the game feels not so high budget, so there you go...\nAnother issue is the bugs/glitches. The are many clipping issues, some stuff can be exploited, they even let us access parts outside of the map (which they shouldn't) which, just like it sounds, will cause you to go under the map, clip through materials and will FORCE you to reload a checkpoint (or a quicksave, if you remember to do that) which are very far away from eachother!\nAnother gripe is the first person platforming which is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! You move WAY too fast for such precise platforming, which will cause you to rage sometimes. I raged once, though I didnt quit, I just kept trying and nailed it, and that feeling of accomplishment is really ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, I must say!\nAngry gets stuff done I guess...\nThe enemy AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in epic proportions, though it feel like it was on purpose, to catch that 2.5D feeling into full 3D. And even though they are really bad, the game is reall really really REALLY hard! You must pay attention to avoid traps because they will take lots of health and then just a bullet will take you back to a checkpoint you reached half an hour ago!\nI never tried multiplayer and honestly, I couldn't care less, the Single Player is just so much fun I just don't even look at the Multiplayer icon in the menu!\nThe game is also quite long, I beat it in 11 hours, but the last boss fight... It took me maybe 30 or more retries to get the boss, and I must adress: I killed him because he got stuck in the terrain so it was easy to kill him.\nOverall, Rise of the Triad succeeds at what a every video game should go for: being fun! In fact I would say it's some of the most fun I've had in the past couple of years and maybe (just maybe) it's one of my GOTY nomenees of 2013 (better than Shadow Warrior 2013, in my totally honest opinion), despite it's massive flaws that really stop it from being the amazing game it could've been.\n\nThus I'm giving it 2 scores, a biased and an unbiased one:\n-Overall, yeah it was fun, but everything about it mediocre except the gameplay and the level design, so it gets an unbiased score of 5/10.\n-I found it just so ridiculously fun, gory and replayable that I want to ignore it's issues, though some persist and do break the experience for me, making give it a biased score of 8/10, thanks to the huge amount of fun I've had with it.\n\nFun is really the word here, so go out, buy it for 14€ or 15$ or whatever; or if the issues bother you, wait for a sale. It's totally worth your coins (see what I did there? :D)\n\nAlso, side note: I want to thank W1n5t0n for gifting me this game, I really appreciate it! I had a blast with this game! :D\n","April 8, 2014","true","22.1"," 111 of 156 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","111","156","0","23"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genepoolisstagnant/recommended/217140/","genepoolisstagnant","Earth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genepoolisstagnant/","496 products in account","Rise of the Triad is a reboot of a cult classic from the 90's, an over-the-top, arcade-like fast-paced first person shooter game in the spirit of games like Doom, Quake, and Duke 3D. What really set apart ROTT from other FPS games of it's era, was that bullet weapons had infinite ammo and all of the other weapons are variants of rocket launchers, flamethrowers and magical weapons. It was also one of the first games where you blew up humans instead of monsters, but of course more enemies are encountered throughout the game like robots. The game also had many traps and obstacles to get passed, like flame walls or fireballs, crushers and more. There was also a scorebar for those who liked to make high scores.\n\nThis reboot brings back everything you loved about the original ROTT and other games in it's era. It keeps everything you loved about games in the 90's. Long non-linear levels using the colored-key door style system with plenty secrets to be found (and secret levels!), boss fights at the end of each episode, weapons scatterd everywhere and many enemies needing to be blown up. Just like the original, there's also lots of fun obstacles and small platforming segments, now improved since this version has jumping. The 4 different characters all with different stats that you can play as also comment on things going on in the world which adds a nice little touch. There's a story, but the gameplay isn't stressed upon it. Basically, the H.U.N.T team is sent out to clear out the Triads from any trouble they are causing, until they find out that they are being ordered by something much bigger than they first thought; El Oscuro.\n\nThe graphics are really good, especially for a UE3 game. That being said, it may favor Nvidia cards a little more than AMD cards. It looks better than many other UE3 games in my opinion. Sharp particles, huge detailed environments and many pretty lights, and an insane amount of gore. Watch heads, brains, hearts, intestines and blood splatter and bounce off the walls as you blow your enemies to bits. Animations, specifically the first person weapon animations are sexy, got that badas­s mo­fo feel to them. Add on to the fact that the music is some shredding metal remixes of the originals, it even enhances that badas­s effect.\n\nThe devs are very responsive to their customers and keep a close eye on their forums. Many people have suggested features throughout the game's development and many of the things that the community wanted most, they were able to implement into the next patch, such as more multiplayer levels, a new weapon which was the shotgun, new player models for MP, and a classic quicksaving feature which they admitted to being an oversight not being in 1.0 in the first place. Not to mention they're just cool dudes to talk to and play with.\n\nThe multiplayer community isn't huge, but it is very active. The community makes new MP levels very often, some SP levels have started to rise up recently too.  Every Saturday the community gets together and plays all of the most popular custom maps, and the developers often join in too and it's a lot of fun. This is the only game I have ever pre-ordered, and it was worth every penny.\n\n---------------------\nTL;DR\n\nGameplay - 9/10\n\nSound/Music - 10/10\n\nGraphics - 8.5/10\n\nLevel Design - 8/10\n\nHumor - 8/10\n\nAchievement difficulty - 6/10\n\nIf you miss fast-paced games with Doom and Quake's campaign style, this is a no-brainer for you.\n----------------------","December 1, 2014","true","821.6"," 40 of 50 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","40","50","2","3"

Although it received mostly average reviews from critics, it was one of my favourite games of 2013, and seriously kicks butt with its nostalgic twitch gameplay.\n\nFrom the get-go, you’ll be zipping through a Nazi fortress, firing everything from dual pistols to drunk missiles and flamewalls. The excalibat is especially fun, and can be used to deflect projectiles, send your enemies flying with a single strike, or summon a wall of exploding baseballs. You can also turn into a dog and bite people to death.\n\nROTT never forgets that it’s a game, and retains a steady sense of humour throughout its over-the-top awesomeness. You eat porridge to regain health, get an achievement for tea-bagging corpses, and while exploring the many secret areas scattered throughout each level, keep an eye out for a near-naked portrait of Kim Jong-un. Nods to the original game can also be found, along with a certain buck-toothed fish that players may remember from Commander Keen, Quake, and a stack of other games.\n\nThe campaign is about eight hours long, and you play as one of five members of H.U.N.T. (High-risk United Nations Task-force), trying to prevent the Triad, a cult, from nuking Los Angeles. Each character has unique stats and occasionally different one-liners, which adds a little bit of replay value alongside rising difficulty levels.\n\nAt the end of each chapter of ROTT, you'll get to do battle with a boss. They take a hell of a lot of missiles to the face before they kick the bucket, and are a total blast to fight against. One that I found particularly memorable was NME (Nasty Metallic Enforcer), a giant rotating robot that fires an endless barrage of heat-seeking missiles at you, before making the floor drop out from beneath your feet and into a pool of lava.\n\nEvery once in a while, gunplay is broken up with platforming sequences. First person platforming is almost always a little awkward, and you will die, but once you get the hang of it, bouncing across the room and over pillars of fire is a lot of fun.\n\nROTT is by no means an easy game, and you'll die without ever seeing it coming, thanks to numerous instant death traps, easy slips into lava pits, and just being shot to hell and back in general. Quick-saving is an option, but you'll lose points every time you do it (thanks to Serious Pony for pointing that out). Otherwise, you'll have to rely on unforgiving checkpoints that'll have you replaying large portions of the level. Although this bugs a lot of players, I enjoyed the challenge it presented.\n\nThe only real issues I encountered were glitches that stuck me in inescapable positions, thus forcing a checkpoint reload. This only happened to me two or three times, so it's forgiveable. There's also the matter of completely braindead AI that stand still while you pump them full of lead, but ROTT is difficult enough without enemies who can think.\n\nThe fast-paced run-and-gun Nazi-exploding eyeballs-splattering-on-your-screen action is accompanied by a wicked soundtrack, featuring a good dose of rock/metal, as well as some softer tracks and an option to play the soundtrack from the original game. But sometimes, on your second playthrough, it feels so much better to turn off the game’s music and play Skeletonwitch through the Steam Music Player instead \m/\n\nROTT also features what I’m led to believe is a fantastic multiplayer community that play every Saturday night, and I would love to join them. However, I’m an Australian, and one of the chief woes of being an Aussie gamer is that the majority of online players, including those of ROTT, are overseas, resulting in differing time zones and crazy high ping (my poor internet connection doesn’t do me any favours either). If you’re close to the US or European servers, subscribe to the multiplayer map collection and check out the details here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=320949530\n\nAs for my original statement, wherein I compared ROTT to Duke Nukem Forever, while Duke let us down with a failed attempt to bring a classic game into the era of weapon limits and health that magically regenerates when you hide behind a wall and breathe a lot, ROTT fully embraces its roots and utilises them to the max, resulting in the most fun I’ve had in an FPS since Serious Sam. If you’re the type who prefers a serious and realistic approach to your gaming experience, stay far away. Everyone else, roll up your sleeves and take off your thinking caps. It’s time to kill some Nazis.","September 10, 2014","true","24.3"," 44 of 57 people (77%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","77","44","57","9","6"

It didn't ask you to aim up or down, quick save every few minutes, or worry about fiddling with graphics settings. It did, however, beg you to explode, shoot, and instagib everything.\n\nInterceptor Entertainment's 2013 remake is an earnest love letter to the original—warts and all. There are no quick saves, for example. There's no regenerating health. The game doesn't even have actual cutscenes aside from the intro. What it  does  have is an undeniable charm. This is Quake on steroids. Things move faster, explosions are bigger, and the giblets are greater.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=167436292\n\nYou play as a member of H.U.N.T., a Special Forces unit sent to a nondescript island to investigate cult activity. The cultists, it seems, are also some sort of military force? And have rocket launchers? Honestly, it doesn't matter. You're not going to play RotT for its story, but for its retro shooter sensibilities.\n\nRotT is a hard game that follows in the footsteps of classics like Doom. The challenge isn't in killing enemies, but in managing your health and ammo. Running out of rockets is akin to bringing a knife to a gunfight—which is funny, since the melee attack is super effective. This isn't your modern, hide-and-shoot, cover-based game. Instead, you run and jump around corners with guns blazing. If you aren't covered in gore, you're not doing it right.\n\nMultiplayer makes great use of the game's super fast pace. Having 16 players jumping around a map at hyperspeed while picking up power ups that let them fly across the map is amazing. Oh, and I'm now 100 percent sure that text-to-speech should be in every game. RotT reads out anything that anyone types into the chat, rendering multiplayer matches a mixture of chaotic fun and laugh-until-you-explode-because-you're-still-in-game action.\n\nThe most important thing about a game like this is the gunplay—it's fan-freaking-tastic. Ignore the basics like pistols and the submachine gun, and you've got an awesome selection of weapons at your disposal. A staff that shoots lightning, a flak cannon that chains explosions, a rocket launcher masquerading as a gatling gun and more.\n\nFor better or for worse, RotT isn't afraid of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you off. Breakaway floors? Check. Indiana Jones-style giant rolling balls? Check. Bosses that just won't die? Check. This game has all of the things that make old school games nearly unplayable today, but they're the reason that Rise of the Triad is an annoyingly amazing game.","November 1, 2015","true","14.9"," 31 of 41 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","31","41","5","0"

If you want my recommendation I would say pick a fast character with good defence, as running around at the speed of sound is just so much fun. No matter how you play as though, the voice acting will be bloody horrible but in a good way that I ended up laughing.\n\nYou start with a basic pistol which does pretty low damage until you get another pistol in which you can then duel wield, even though weak it still felt very fun to use. However, you will then recieve heavy weapons which are by far some of the best weapons in the game. You can rocket jump and absolutely destroy enemies. There are a total of 7 different heavy weapons, which range from rocket launchers (BOOM!), flame throwers (SSS!), and heat seeking missles (beep beep).\nHowever, the absolute best weapons in the game, are the powerups and the magic weapons. For powerups you have God mode, which is not just infinite health, you are actually a God and you can zap enemies killing them in 1 hit. Then you got dog mode which turns you into a dog where you can bite enemies and do AOE (area of effect) attacks. Then you have the brilliant Excellebat, which is a bat that acts like a sword, everytime you hit an enemy they will blow up leaving a bloody mess everywhere. The final magic weapon is the magic staff, which shoots an electric beam as well as creating a shield for you.\n\nThere are also powerdowns, such as the mushroom which makes you feel like you're on some acid trip, and a bouncy powerdown which makes you bounce everytime you come into contact with a wall.\n\nIn each stage there are a number of secrets, when you find these secrets you can get special weapons, ammo, health, and easter eggs which takes me back to the old Quake days. In fact, the entire game is basically an old school game which non-regerating health, keys, floating spinning weapons, coins floating around for points, etc.\n\nI will however say, that the A.I. of the enemies is abysmal, I see them regularing forgetting to shoot their gun at me, walk into walls, standing in place, and so on and so forth.\n\nThe bossfights are kinda mixed bag, the first and 3rd boss fights are pretty entertaining, but the 2nd one was very dull where you just stand in a room waiting for the guy to stop shooting, then you move out shoot at him, and repeat the same process. And the final boss holy cow it is bad, it starts out pretty cool, you're flying with the flying powerup, but once you beat the 1st form of the boss, the 2nd form is just the final boss running towards you and you just keep spraying.\nAlso the final boss kept glitching out on me where I had to reset.\n\nOh and the last problem I have is the freaking bugs. I've frequently got a bug where I could not fire my weapon until I restarted a checkpoint, the enemies would freak out and become deformed, and many textures were broken on me.\n\nAlthough the last complaint may seem a bit major, I cannot deny that I had a blast while playing Rise of the Triad, it's mindless fun, and that's all I need.\n\nThere is multiplayer, however I've never managed to get a match with enough people which is shame.\nAlso when you type in the chat and press enter, the game will actually read it out in a robotic voice like microsoft Sam, which is pretty bloody cool.\nOnce I've managed to join a populated server, I will edit this review detailing how it went and how it works.\n\nLast thing to mention is the brilliant soundtrack, almost all of the music are remixes of the soundtrack from the 1995 version and it is kickass!\n\nRise of the Triad is Excellent, and is how you make a proper reboot of a beloved first person shooter.","November 25, 2013","true","20.8"," 30 of 42 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","30","42","0","1"

Well, I would rather call it a reboot. I mean, 20 years is such a huge gap. It's still fast-paced FPS with competetive multiplayer that think that it's very hip due to old-school elements.\nThey also kept updated since then. Gameplay-wise most important change was inclusion of quicksaves and shotgun-bazooka thing that is placed in almost every level now.\n\nTechnical-wise, this game was a complete mess at the launch. It had one thousands and one glitch and had awful performance for many people. If it was some AAA company, people sure would have spent all their time whining, yea. Something something EA access something beta testing something.\nBut not to worry, developers even today keep updating the game, killing bugs and trying to improve performance, so it's not bad as it was. It still didn't stop me from getting stuck once because of failed trapdoor on Episode 4. Or even to have a level to fail to load next part of itself in that one map where I tried to use quicksaves for first time. Something about getting to checkpoint, then quickloading to pre-checkpoint save and trying to progress from there.\n\nMultiplayer community is kinda there. Usually there is nobody playing, but game's steam group actually runs events where it invites players to multiplayer every saturday. I know that there were few people this winter, but because my game (or Steam) glitched and wouldn't see Steam Workshop maps that I subscriped to at all, I had to miss the fray.\n\nPlotwise it's a same wacky story. Something about HUNT team that is you going to kick butt of nazi-like people and monks of Triad cult, while turning into doges and blowing up everybody with barks. In other words, no plot outside of intro and ending. It's just wackyness, coolness and trolling. Yea, trolling and memes, yay. Over 20 levels that are put into 4 episodes.\nAnd look, there is Escape from Vomitorium level.\n\nWell, actually settings looks awesome and enviroment is often fashinating, like first level of Episode 4 which introduces evil magic monks combines cathedrals and beds of flowers with snake-mouth gates and rivers of blood. That one was awesome.\n\nGameplay is simple in that it keeps many stuff from the original ROTT. Interesting, even. Like, you still get to pick 5 characters, which are more sanely balanced in stats. Actually, there are only two stats: speed and endurance (health). Sadly, due to this game being a hitscan abuse game, speed matters very little and only will get you into trouble faster, so character with highest endurance is the best, no thinking about this.\n\nAnother interesting thing is how weapons work now. You can hold only 5 weapons. But in reality the first 3 weapons are taken by bullet weapons that are direct upgrades over each other so it's silly that they take individual slots. They also have reloading and iron sight for those, but they are just developers being busy with trolling instead of bugfixing. Ammo is infinite and all weapons are always 100% accurate, pretty much. So you spent your time by sniping people and never releasing fire button while waiting around corner.\n4 and 5th slots are taken by special weapons. 4th is for bazookas and other such weapons, which have limited ammo. You can pick only one type, if you run over another one then you will swap them. And they say that Halo was newschool. Very explosive. 5th is magic weapon. There are only two of them and you will rarely get them. They aren't really different from bazookas.\nYou now now use knife anybody as well and it's a pretty sweet addition. You actually don't have to aim as much with this, just press a button and your character will lunge toward the enemy who is close, stabbing with two knives. There are plenty of placed to use this. And there are plenty of places where you will get stuck in geometry and control of your character will be disabled for 5-10 seconds. Yay.\n\nAlso you can heat up most health items to double up the amount of health that they give. It's pretty great idea from original, to sacrifice rocket ammo to put porridge on fire. Though ammo was more valuable in original.\n\nPowerups are also fun, having both good and bad wacky ones. The most awesome one is a doge one, where you are invincible, can pounce and bite people to death and can also do an explosive bark/howl, though in this game it will immeditly end the dog mode because it was way too good in original.\n\nBut yes, sadly, this game isn't exactly a comeback of 90s or arcade style of FPS. The thing is, almost every enemy that you fight are hitscan attacking ones. So instead of rushing in and circle-strafing around room like a pro like you did in classic shooters, it playes out more like one of those bad shooters from early 2000s, waiting around corner, peeking out slowly while holding down fire button due to infinite ammo and no recoil. Trying to play it in fast-paced way just means you get murdered more.\nHeck, when I replayed all my favourite 90s shooters I realize that the thing that I also liked about them is that they weren't focused on precisions there, instead being about movement. Most of them had autoaim or big collision. Now here it's hard to hit anything with bullets when running.\nYea, original has same hitscan stuff, but combination of reliable autoaim and hit stunlock on enemies made it a bit better.\n\nThough at least it uses special enemies with more taste than '93. Enforcers are more rare and then don't take as long to die from bullets. Monks are also more fun, with melee ones being weaker, but having extended range. Also helps that Episode 4 isn't just tiny rooms.\n\nAnother thing is how amazingly little of game sense I was getting when playing this game. I mean, I count FPS genre as my favourite, but here I felt like I was a blind kitty, especially when playing for first time. Most of time I spent looking for enemy who kept shooting me.\nThere actually are few things to contribute that. Damage indicator actually points at the spot where you got hit instead of where this shot came from. And I don't know what player's character collision is, but I doubt that it's a classic collision cube, since there were too many times where indicator pointed in another direction from enemy. Not only that, but the colors style between enemies and background is so similar, it's hard to notice them at all. Also I had hard time being aware about traps and doors opening up. Or even what switches do.\n\nBosses are fancy, albeit lacking proper boss music. Some are good, but most often, you have to do usual things, like spamming homing rocket out of side room where you are hiding. Yea, phase 2 of the first boss was the hardest thing here. The most cheap at least. And then there are things like Boss 2 spamming hitscan at you. Did they ever play good arcade games?\n\nIt also has traps and platforming. Not sure about traps, maybe they are cheap, but that was refreshing to try to handle real traps for myself.  I may have not managed to get out in time, but I felt awesome because I would figure out what to do at the very last second. And die. Now, platforming. A precise platforming in a game with weak air control? I mean, at least I spent my time playing the awesome Jumpmaze mod for Doom Skulltag back in time and I personally still love that. And I like this, when it made my heart beat that I might miss platform. But I shudder to think what kind of experience others are getting.\nE2L1 silver key puzzle still sucks.\n\nThere is also multiplayer. Didn't get to try. It's competetive, no coop. Just DM, TDM, CTF. Same rules as main game. Probably chaotic too.\n\nI would rather give it a "can't decide" recommendation if I could. Otherwise I was quite dissapointed that instead of playing like FPS from my favourite era, instead playing like one from era that I dislike. Plus bugs and performance.","December 29, 2015","false","16.6"," 30 of 46 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","30","46","2","5"

For all its bells and whistles and the promise of old school fun, it didn't deliver. The singleplayer campaign is a prime example of poor 90's game design with traps, puzzles, and enemy spawns that require memorization to beat vs skill. The game's combat is primarily find a firebomb and use the ammo for it as efficiently as possible while picking off individual enemies using your mp40 with stun locking animations. Boss fights are essentially finding a way to glitch the boss and/or cheese the fight. There's no real skill involved except for maybe the last boss but that's also based on knowing where the armor pickups are; you can still cheese it by glitching the boss into a wall. Most of the later levels are designed really poorly with only a few of them being fun to run through. The first set of levels delivers the experience really well with overwhelming enemies that you have the joy of exploding into bits but it doesn't stay that way. The multiplayer is really the only good selling point. It's fast, frantic, and rather fun but the lack of players and servers in all areas doesn't paint a good picture for it.

In addition to this the player may also run into some occasional bugs although this has been drastically improved by the developers post release.\nAs for what comes to the community it is currently rather small but still very active with people making custom maps and doing frequent multiplayer events so the multiplayer is definitely not dead.\n\nIn conclusion: would i recommend this game?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bVork/recommended/217140/","bVork","bVork","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bVork/","1310 products in account","This is an oldschool first-person shooter, for good and for ill.\n\nThe levels are completely divorced from reality. There are lots of secrets to find, both by using odd-looking sections of the wall and by (rocket) jumping to places that don't really look like you should be able to access. The action is fast and insane. There's no saving heavy weapons for later: the game expects you to use the many kinds of rocket launchers at first opportunity. And if you do run out of rockets, you also have bullet weapons with infinite ammo at your disposal. All of this results in an first-person shooter of the kind we just don't see anymore. Scoring is slightly more complex than in old first-person shooters, with a combo system for killing enemies in quick succession.\n\nOn the other hand, some things that could safely have been left in the past have also been carried over. Enemies blend into the environment and aren't too smart, sometimes getting caught on geometry. It's hard to tell when you're getting shot and how much damage you're taking. The same casual approach to level boundaries that lets you search for secrets can also result in you jumping outside of the level with no way to get back in. There are lots of deathtraps and jumping puzzles (not necessarily a bad thing, but...) unfortunately paired with a checkpoint system (there are no manual saves) that might make you repeat sequences multiple times. The checkpoints are fairly well placed but it's still a pain to fall in lava and die after spending five or ten minutes carefully navigating a complex room.\n\nMultiplayer seems pretty broken at the moment. Server browsing is sorted by geographic distance, not ping. And the ping shown during a match seems to be wrong. There is no way a ping of 40 should result in other players warping around and hitching constantly. If they ever sort this out, multiplayer seems like it could be very fast and very fun, but online play just doesn't work well enough to make it enjoyable at this time.\n\nThere are also some optimization issues. The game runs mostly perfectly for me, but occasionally I enter a room where the framerate drops to 30 or even 20 for no good reason. It's not enough to be a dealbreaker, but this is not the game for you if you refuse to play anything under 60 frames per second.\n\nStill, I think the good far outweighs the bad in Rise of the Triad. There really is nothing quite like it: a well-done oldschool FPS with a shiny new coat of paint.","August 4, 2013","true","5.6"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/recommended/217140/","geoluz","GeoLuz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/","180 products in account","I never played Rise of the Triad (ROTT) when it was released back in 1994. I knew that this game was one of the pioneers of FPS PC gaming. It was very simple in concept: shoot to kill and the plot would take a backseat to the action. It required players to hone their FPS skills and adjust to the fast paced nature of the game.\n\nROTT is a remake of the original classic game. For better or worse, the game has no cutscenes after the introduction, it’s fast paced as everything moves very fast, the explosions are big, and there are plenty of giblets. I remember seeing my frame rate running at 100+ constantly from start to finish.\n\nThe game offers a selection of characters, male and female, for playing against an organization known as The Triad. You are a member of an organization called H.U.N.T., a United Nations taskforce. The Triad members have set up their base of operations in San Nicolas. It is up to you to stop them, but it will not be easy. The game is so fast that the enemies will constantly challenge you while your health and ammo for explosive weapons will need replenishing. Explosive weapons include rockets, heat seekers, and firebombs.\n\nTwo things become clear in this game: it is not about taking cover and shooting and the story is not that important. You go into every room guns blazing, jumping around corners avoiding gunfire, and avoiding the many traps that have been set up. There are no concerns about reloading the basic weapons like the pistols and machine guns since they contain infinite ammo. The explosive weapons contain finite ammo and using up all the ammo on these weapons can be disastrous against tougher enemies, especially bosses. This challenge also applies to the staff that fires lightning and the excalibat, a baseball bat that shoots deadly green balls. The explosive weapon that feels really powerful is the firebomb. Man, that firebomb can sure make a difference in boss battles since it causes multiple explosions upon impact. Just don’t be close to the impact of those explosions.\n\nThere are some frustrating experiences you will go through in the single player campaign. The game was released without quicksaves, but a patch has added quicksaves to quell some of the frustration that comes with playing certain levels of this game. A checkpoint can be placed at the beginning of a dangerous puzzle and if you die in the middle of solving the puzzle you will be forced back to the checkpoint. Many puzzles tend to include moving spike traps that require you to learn the pattern of the movements so that you can move on unharmed and without losing your life. Another frustration that sometimes comes into play is the tendency to get stuck in some corners and it can be hard to remove yourself from those corners.\n\nThe enemy A.I. is generally average. Some guards will strafe from left to right or right to left, but that is as intelligent as they can be. You can kill one guard while a nearby guard will react like nothing happened. I found the enemies to be nothing more than sitting ducks during combat. The difficulty you face against these enemies is their numbers. Sometimes an enemy will throw a net to neutralize and the only way to escape from the net is to use your knife to cut through it. Each episode ends with a boss and each one is predictable as long as you can find the attack pattern.\nROTT does add quite a bit of sense of humor, especially if you find secrets and secret levels. There are secrets scattered around every level. The secrets contain coins, ammo, and the occasional surprise such as pictures of the game’s developers.\n\nI think the graphics of ROTT are decent, but the gameplay mechanics feel outdated. The gameplay mechanics such as no need to take cover during a shootout, no need to reload conventional weapons are outdated since today’s game emphasize the need to take cover and the need to reload when ammo is out. I understand that the selling point of this game is to relive the past using modern day graphics, but you may want to look elsewhere if you are seriously into FPS games with modern gameplay mechanics.\n\nAt a price of $15, this game is worth buying for nostalgic fans of the FPS genre. It will appeal to deathmatch fans who want both the single-player campaign and the multiplayer matches. I think that ROTT is a respectable game that pays homage to the old school first-person shooters of the 1990s.\n\nMy Score: 7/10\n","September 13, 2015","true","27.7"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","0"

Sadly this doesn't work well either as it causes more bugs to an already buggy game and for some reason decreases your score.\nI have to also make sure to point out the game is extremely buggy. Enemies will often get stuck frozen as well as weapons.\nI was also disappointed that an amount of the games level design went against ROTTs unique arsenal.\nFor instance, there are very few ideal moments to use the flamewall as all the 3D geometry and detail clutter many areas.\nThe new muliplayer seems to try and be more like Quake than the original ROTTs multiplayer, which was goofy and over the top.\n\nAfter all this negativity I stated, you must think I have a large amount of dislike for this game.\nWell it may surprise you that I find it very enjoyable.\nIt's nice to have speed and be able to take damage, it's nice to find actual secrets, and it's really nice to see gibs.\nI think that I've learned to enjoy it and the mess it is over all this time.\nWhen I see it for 3.75 dollars during sales, it's hard to say the money is wasted.\nNot a penny more though.","January 24","true","67.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","4"

The graphics have dated horribly in such a short period of time, and the further away from release it gets, the more amateurish the game seems. Day one bugs are still unpatched, and despite a 1.05 version being released 3 months ago, nothing perceptible has changed in regards to the quality of the game itself. If you remember the original and still haven't bought this one, I'd recommend it for no more than 5 bucks. Otherwise, spend your hard-earned cash on a better FPS.\n\nEDIT: So it's 6 months later and it's not great. Not by a long-shot. The Unreal engine is still poorly optimised, the bugs are still everywhere and occasionally game-breaking. I'm ashamed.\n\nSo I'm gonna admit that if I wasn't tripping on nostalgia right now, this game in it's current state would be unacceptable. While the sound is great, the locations are beautiful, the weapon design is awesome and the gameplay fast and brutal, at it's core the current release shouldn't have made it past beta. In many ways it's a buggy mess - occasionally to the point of breaking the game. I won't go into all the detail, but the longer I played, the more frustrating the bugs became. The checkpoint system is also a pain in the ♥♥♥, especially when it continually starts you back at the beginning of a frustrating boss battle or jumping puzzle. I have no doubt it'll be great in a few weeks after some patching, but for the time being, save yourself the stress.","July 31, 2013","false","24.8"," 47 of 83 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","47","83","0","1"

This first person shooter is very fast paced, filled with crude languages and references, and very satisfying. The game however falls short in pacing. You're often left to explore many new areas, having to find a switch of sorts to trigger the next portion of the level. Both the exploration and platforming sub-portions of the game break its fast pace and honestly ruin it. The switches which are necessary to proceed are very hard to find and built in with the delightfully fitting backgrounds. Often times I found myself spending upwards of half an hour just to notice an extra detail built into a wall.\n\nOne of the more noticeable characteristics about RoT is the possible collet-a-thon. Each level presents you with numerous secret areas to discover, filled with coins which tally up to give you a total percentage of the level completed. Although not necessary to the total game completion, this allows for numerous (or possibly arduous) amounts of replay value.\n\nAnother downside of RoT is the framerate. It is inconsistent. Many of the areas in which you find yourself are extremely large, and contain many enemies on the screen at once. Having your framerate drop down to 10fps while surrounded by 20 enemies at a time is not an enjoyable experience. There are seldom boss fights in these levels, but when there are it is hard to distinguish them from the regular enemies themselves. The bosses, in fact, were very broken. When confronting the first boss, I found myself able to stand to the side and continuously spray him down, with little to no effort.\n\nAlthough the game presents numerous flaws, it was (and still is) an overall enjoyable experience. The fast paced violence is perfect in the right moments. The crude language fits with the game well, and all of the Easter Eggs found in the many secret areas of each level just add to the atmosphere.","August 30, 2014","true","5.1"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","2"

I'm not an ♥♥♥ kisser nor a hater, so I wanted to give my thoughts. ROTT is a shooter game, a reboot of the 1995 shooter of the same name. For the time, it was a rough game, but the wackiness helped it become a cult classic. The new game has been made to keep the same gameplay, the same wackiness as the original. The gameplay is execellent, blasting through enemies with an arsenal of weapons. The level design is quite good. It really stays faithful to its roots. The multiplayer is mostly absent, because not enough people play it. There are MP events, but they still only attract a dozen of players. This is one of the most poorly optimized games I've ever played. The framerate can drop massively at parts, and it can be annoying. Quicksaves have been added, too. If you're looking for a solid SP game that you can spend a while in, this is the game for you. If you're looking for the next Unreal Tournament, look somewhere else. It seems that people either make this game sound better than it actually is, or they make the game sound worse than what it actually is, so tread carefully.

Combat is very fun, but the jumping puzzles suck major ♥♥♥! The gameplay is fast, fierce, and packed with nostalgia, but the game has loads of bugs that can even corrupt your save file... GAHH!! Talking about the save system, you can only have one save. So if you wanted to go back and replay a level, you will be overwriting your progress... which is very stupid. This game pisses me off. I want to love this game so much, but the ♥♥♥♥ing bugs, jumping physics, and some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ design decisions make me hate it at the same time.\n\nI beat the game and the only episode that gave me problems was the 2nd episode. They loaded this episode with tons of stupid frustrating ♥♥♥♥♥♥ jumping puzzles. This almost ruined the entire game for me as I, of course, rage quit a view times due to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ jumping physics as your character would slip and slide all over the damn place.\n\nAlso, the boss fights are a joke. They are cheap, stupid, and bullet sponges. Walking into walls and stand there looking like an idiot as I pump them full of lead with my machine gun.

Got part way into the first level, and I can say that honestly this game does seem like a LOT of fun, a kick-♥♥♥ good time. I still however in my regard consider it to be unplayable. They HAVE optimized it more, and I respect that a lot I really do... but they haven't done it enough yet. I've tweaked everything to absolute LOW and used a guide on Steam to get the best framerate for the game but it still runs like complete ♥♥♥ and I still would not touch it in the state it's in, and sincerely hope they do optimize it more. My framerate seems to jumble between 60-5fps frequently and bizarrely.\n\nSo why do I recommend a game that jumps from 60-5fps within a couple meters walking distance? Because it's expected by now that you'll have a better computer than mine, which can probably run the game fine. The game is fun and likely addicting, and I assume if you've got an i7 processor or better, you'll have no problem. There is still no excuse however for why my only recently outdated computer can't run this game with moderate speeds at all times.\n\nI do not have a home computer in my home, all I use is this Gateway laptop.\nMy specs are:\ni3 370-M  - 2.40Gz - Intel Core Processor\nATI Mobility Radeon 5650 Graphics Card\n1366x768 total resolution","July 12, 2014","true","2.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I saw it had mixed reviews, but my experiences with ROTT from the 90's and the summer sale led me to grab this one. Is it perfect? Nope...some things are oldschool in a bad way, like the robotic and glitchy animations of enemies. (some even move while in that default, civilian-like pose) But if you like first person platforming (many people don't) and oldschool non-subtle commando style gameplay (doom, quake, serious sam), then you'll love ROTT 2013. The pacing is fast and the enemies can be unforgiving even as you're mowing them down in unrealistic numbers at ludicrous speed. It takes a little time to get used to the first person platforming, but once you get a sense of where you're supposed to go, it's pretty fun. The controls are probably the game's strongest point -- I had no problem getting used to the unrealistic 3d platformer physics.","July 12, 2014","true","10.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nevergiveupchief/recommended/217140/","Nevergiveupchief","Witch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nevergiveupchief/","222 products in account","Review:\nThe concept of the game is pleasing, though at the core it's riddled with problems; be it bugs or optimization issues. To the point where it frequently hampers my enjoyment. I can handle buggy games, though when it comes to a cloud of locus it becomes difficult to ignore.\n\nMainly dealing with AI, enemies, and their models being utterly janky, often you will see a model in its standard stiff pose as if it's ready to be animated. This is not the rare happening, every single level I have encountered this issue. The shill will say simply agro them, instead of picking them off while they're in this state, I could do this, but it is still a glaring design flaw and bug that any game designer not matter the team, would eventually want to root out.\n\nAnd then there's the down right poor design flaws, with the hit scan approach to enemies, be it a boss fight or common fodder, every ecounter will leave you with you feeling pain, often in droves. A shooter certainly can use the hit scan enemy, though it requires the designer(s) to be smart about their placement, instead enemies are carelessly placed with no way to avoid the hail of bullets. The most eregious aspect of this, encompasses enemies shooting you from unknow places, and behind gates that rocket's blast radius is prone to miss even when the explosion lies an inch before the enemy. Perhaps not a bug, but it's an awful over sight, that not even many of the classics fell victim too, as much of a carnival ride the Build engine was, it didn't skimp on the explosions.\n\nThere's seldom a post, beam, or anything to cover behind, something even a shooter as old as Wolfenstein 3D allows. Even the classics understood it was cheap to be killed by a bullet from someone not readily visible on the screen, often they will design the levels in a certain way to allow the player a means of  playing it smart, or a way for those low on ammo while against a fearsome foe to trudge foward. Instead with RoTT you are left a linear way of dealing with enemies, using you rockets in sellect ways, which with the average shooter would be fine, though may I remind your main weapon in this game is a series of rocket launchers.\n\nOn top of that there's platforming which is often used to kill you, and used in the most idiosyncratic of places, as a means of prolonging the length of the game, in a very diabolical way. Even going as far as to negate a star for quick saving for said areas, it's truly silly. Not to say I dislike the platforming, as it stands, if it was used in more opportune situations, and you possibly had more body awareness it'd be more than competent.\n\nJudgement:\nThere's a good game under all of this jank, despite all of the listed issues, I have enjoyed certain things this game has to offer. Often creative level design, that require one to play like a speed demon, even if its pulled down by those certain moments of linearity, and tight rooms of hit scans, there's some serious fun to be had. That is, if you are able to circumvent the aforementioned problems plaguing this game.\n\n6/10\n\nPerformance:\nMy framerate is also very sporadic, despite having a fairly good build, ain't no I7, but there's no reason an I5 shouldn't be able to consistently run this game. In certain areas I'll have 150-200 fps, more intense ones 60-100 fps, then randomly in what by all means should be rather low demanding areas, it'll be 30-60 fps. Indie game or not, there is no clear reason why the optimization should be this horrible, it's ♥♥♥♥ing Unreal Engine 3 and an ugly game at that.\n\nFor reference here is my build:\nCPU\nIntel Core i5 4590 @ 3.30GHz\nRAM\n8.00GB Single-Channel DDR3 @ 666MHz (9-9-9-24)\nGraphics\n4096MB ATI AMD Radeon R9 380 Series (380x)","December 28, 2015","false","10.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StarCraftZergling/recommended/217140/","StarCraftZergling","StarCraftZerg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StarCraftZergling/","102 products in account","Like most reviews, I am going to discuss the Multiplayer and Single Player seperately because each one is unique compared to the other. Let's start with the bad news first:\n\nMultiplayer:\nBOY WAS THIS LACKING IN EVERY WHICH ASPECT! As much as I hate to say that the gameplay was horrid, I did find a bit of enjoyment out of it here and there. The things I didn't like was the lack of creativity with the level design. The maps look good, but the weapon placements are just lazy and silly. Kinda like the community that still plays this game avidly. It's very unbalanced. Whoever has the rocket launcher with the heat-seeking capability is going to slaughter the competition. Him or the s***head spamming the D.R.U.N.K. Rocket. Don't even try to shoot a bullet weapon by the way, because the hit detection is so f***ing off, I have to aim 3 feet in a random direction to hit them. Although it sticks to the original FPS routes in some aspects, it still fails to see how lazy and poorly implemented some of the multiplayer physics are and how the guns are extemely overpowered in the right guy's hands. (Then again, some random bloke off the streets could just pick one up, pull the trigger and BAM killed you) But I feel that the multiplayer is the butt of the joke here. Single player is what tells the story (No pun intended)\n\nSingle Player:\nThis is where classic FPS comes for a beautiful dance party every now and then. Rise of the Triads clearly demonstrates how an original FPS should look (Minus the 8-bit graphics). You may play as 1 of the 5 different characters each unique with a certain strong point in either speed or endurance making the game fun for players that enjoy taking their time and players that like to speedrun while blowing guys heads off, but each comes with the flaw of it's opposite attribute. If he's fast, he isn't that strong and vise versa. RoTT also stuck true with the braindead enemy AI that charges at you carelessly, aiming as if they had an eye patch on both eyes, and being extremely easy to kill if you know how to kill them. And every time you die, you are insulted by the commander telling you that you're a complete f***ing failure and that a nutless monkey could do your job WHICH brings me to the point of how RoTT likes to throw in funny little easter eggs and references which only puffs more perfume on this lovely lady of a game and freshening it up every time. As much as the multiplayer lacked, I believe the single player makes up for it. Not everyone is buying a game for it's single player... *COUGH* CALL OF DUTY, BATTLEFIELD, GEARS OF WAR *COUGH* ...and mainly focuses on the multiplayer aspect of the game. Clearly Interceptor Entertainment said "f*** you modern FPS fanboys and your create-a-class and redundant shooting sections! We know how to do single player the right way!"\n\nAnyway on to the real reason you are all here. You want to know what I think about this game. And to me, this game is only good for it's single player. While the multiplayer can be enjoyable with good friends who also aren't picky in which games they play, it still fails to recognize that it's netcode is poopy and can barely stay fair to everyone. Overall I give the game a 7/10. The multiplayer weighs down the score, but the single player keeps it afloat.

An age way way back, in the before times.  Certainly before New York Times best seller Tom Clancy ever penned his first New York Times best selling Tom Clancy novel.  That being said, Tom Clancy is not in this game, nor is it based on any of his New York Times best selling novel to game adaptations.  Rise of The Triad was developed by the JJ Boys (That's John Romero and John Carmak for the un-initiated) to be a sequel to Super Wolfenstein 4D In Space, and it is.  In this game you play as a member of an elite special forces team C.U.N.T which consists of I P Freely, a ginger, asian girl, some other white kid, and a token black guy who was also white in the original release but changed to be black to accomodate the bleeding heart audiences of today.  The enemies are Nazis.  Magical Nazis...MAGICAL ALIEN NAZIS!  If you've got a pretty beefy rig you can play this game on ludacris settings, and crisscross your fingers that it doesn't bug out and drop you partially into the floor forcing you to restart the level.  Graphically the game is "OMG LOOK AT DEM GRAPHICS!" it's as though they've literally just taken a game from 1992 and remade it to look like 2012.  That's a 20 year graphical improvement.  Fans of Halo and Babbys First Gaem probably won't like this title as it's "Dark Souls Hard" and will punish you for not being the greatest.  (VGTG)  People looking to be the guy are recommended to play through the game on the hardest setting as asian girl, as she has the least hp's just like in real life.  I would rate Rise of The Triad at a whopping five pikachu clocks out of a possible five.  This is totally worth your $14.95 unless you wanted to wait for Super TURBO Rise of The Triad 3D HD The Fightening Ultra Max Boy Edition.","August 7, 2013","true","7.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

A game that so faithfully updates it's original counterpart and manages to keep just about everything the way it was, and should be.  This is very much a shooter rooted in 90's logic and design, it's stronger for it, and I applaud the developers for it.\n\nBasically the idea is you have weapons, and your objective is to blow up everything.  The combat is solid and extremely fast, you're practically encouraged to take damage so long as the damage you're dealing is greater.  Weapons include most everything from the original, including the Firebomb, MP40 & dual pistols, Split Missile, some new ones too and are heavily geared torwards explosives (this is a good thing).  Your base weapons have infinite ammo and don't need to be reloaded.  Your health doesn't regenerate automatically, you have to eat food, which you can cook by firing a rocket at before doing so.\n\nAs with the original, there's some platforming to be had.  And as with the original, it can be mildly frustrating, though at the time of writing a quick save has been patched in making this issue much much less annoying.  You'll jump on bounce platforms, check every wall for secret areas, collect coins to boost your score, avoid spinny blades and fireballs and sometimes become God.  Or a dog.  Sometimes you question the validity of the power up's you acquire.  It doesn't make sense, but it doesn't need to, and that's why it makes sense.\n\nThere's a story, though it's just an excuse to blow up not-so-vaguely Nazi cult members.  The entire single player should last you over 10 hours if you do even a little hunting for secrets, and more if you want to find everything.  It's also replayable with other charcters, though the game doesn't change at all.  But when it's this much fun, it's worth replaying anyway, and there's always another secret to be found.  There's also a multiplayer mode a-la the original title (which was quite fun), though this review is based solely on the single player.","July 4, 2014","true","16.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I'd heard the game was a buggy mess, and sure enough I did experience this same bizarre crash at the start over and over again; that is until it inexplicably just stopped occurring during one attempt to start the game. Since then the game has worked fine, with a poor but consistent and entirely playable frame rate, and no further bugs or crashes. Edit: Lots of bugs, nothing game-breaking, all harmless, mostly hilarious.\n\nThe game feels amazing. The exaggerated momentum and gravity give you enough of a sense of weight and speed as it is, but the 'camera bob' or 'view roll' or whatever you call it takes it even further, deeply immersing you in the role of this incredibly fast and agile character, who, without so much as a pair of legs in sight, has a very real tactile physical presence in the virtual world.\n\nThe visual effects are damn good. Motion blur adds to the sense of speed but can be turned off for those who can't stand it. Bloom is used a little excessively but looks delicious. The particle effects from explosions to blood splats all look awesome, striking a prefect balance between realistic and over-the-top. The appearance as a whole is stylish but realistic. Love it.\n\nThe guns feel great, look great, sound great, the music is awesome, the level design is pretty fantastic... It's just a really good game. Everything about it is delightful.

What is THIS crap??" or "It's an OK remake I guess, but it just doesn't feel like/doesn't capture the magic of the original"? Well, Rise Of The Triad (ROTT) takes exception to all of that.\nAfter putting a ludicrous amount of hours into the original, I can say with confidence that ROTT 2013 not only plays like ROTT '95, but also captures that intangible "magic" or "feel" that made us all fall in love with the original. Even the sound effects and soundtrack are there (albeit updated). It feels like a mid-90's shooter, it has the same humor, and unfortunately all of the same weaknesses of mid-90's shooters. It's ability to warp you straight back to 1995 is its greatest strength and greatest weakness. It's easy to get somewhat bored with this game because it doesn't offer much over the original, that's how faithful it is. After that initial nostalgia high, there isn't much more. Then the little bugs start to become noticable.\nThe hit indicator is often incorrect, sometimes I'll be in a huge area with a straggler hitting me from some damned place, and I'll have no idea where, partially because of the inaccurate hit indicator and partially because enemies weapons are quiet and weapons have indistinctive sounds, easily blending in with the background music.\nYou'll die a lot in this game, as you should. That's how we rolled in the mid-90's. Games were far more unforgiving. Enemies are unfairly and ridiculously precise with their weapons, again how it should be.\nIf you've never played ROTT '95 or any shooter from that era, I'm not sure this is for you. If you're a fan of the original or just 90's shooters in general, this is a MUST HAVE.","April 8, 2014","true","1.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

Unfortunately this game also returned some of the issues with old games.\n\nI'm also not good at writing but Ill still try...\n\nIt's good if you like this type of games, but I have lots of issues with it.\nSmaller things that sometimes bother me are the lack of variation in enemies, dudes who usually don't come in large hordes and just stand there and shoot at you, some of them try to dodge your attacks which is just annoyng, so the most funs weapons aren't as fun for me as they sould be in a game like Serious Sam or Painkiller. But most annoying is when the enemies take the better weapons you hold and you only get those back by killing them. There's also some bugs and glitches here and there.\n\nBut the worst part is the platforming. Do you remember when platforming was just amazing in FPS? Yeah, it never was, and it's still a horrible idea that no game should do (not to be confused with parkour which is what Mirror's Edge does). And I do know that this is one of the things that made the original so... original, but I just can't stand it, and I know many others will hate it to. How fast you move only makes it harder to land on anything.\n\nBut when I wasn't frustrated by the platforming I was having a lot of fun with the shooting and exploring the levels, I just think there are games that do this type of gameplay way better.","October 5, 2014","true","31.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Its one of those tough as nails games that tries to emulate the old school feel of a mid 90s shooter, but I account its difficulty for how cheap it is. Enemies can hit you from anywhere and they blend in with the background as any true soldier should. Its also a vertical game so rather than walking through a shooting gallery of hallways, you get put into large, tall rooms where standard soldiers can sniper you from high above your head. No matter what they distance, if they can see you, they can shoot you even before you ever see them.\n\nThis is a modern is a resurrection of a sequel to Wolfestien 3D that was never a sequel. You select from one of five characters and fight Nazis with guns, making their eyeballs launch at your screen when they explode. I can recommend going with the character that you're least tired of their voice over. Each of the characters has their own speed and power, but they are all quick and nimble. Despite how fast you are the hitscan weapons will hit you if an enemy sees you. Foes never even wait to turn around to face you. Their guns go blazing as they turn around.\n\nSo how are the weapons? You start with a pistol or two and you will find a standard machine guns that lets you have iron sights. These weapons both have unlimited ammunition with no need to reload, because its just so old school like that. Oh there are still reload animations, but they're unnecessary.\n\nBeyond those two standard weapons, there's room for one larger weapon. These larger weapons are fun for the most part. Several of the larger weapons are too similar such as a homing missile launcher and a straight forward rocket launcher. It feels like a waste. The shotgun is a meaty, short range weapon. The large weapons are quite frequent and other than the secret room behind you when the first level starts, the next weapon you get is a rocket launcher in an enclosed space.\n\nWhile the enemy intelligence seems dumb as they line up right in front of you rather than fanning out, they do have interesting facets. Such as they will drop to their knees and beg for their lives. Then sometimes they can pop up and shoot you once you turn around. I melee them, which would save on bullets, but the problem is there is no ammunition for standard weapons. Of course this is to compensate for those hit scan weapons. Its tough to imagine bludgeoning an enemy to death that can sniper you with a pistol. Some enemies will roll into you and take your weapon which is always interesting.\n\nWith levels so vertical, you'll be rising on floating platforms as lifts and using jump plates to hop from area-to-area. These trampolines and hovering platforms are what Rise of the Triad can hang its hat on to make it different than other modern first person shooters that try to be mid 90s. Nazis sure had some pretty interesting technology back then! Perhaps they should have focused more on space age weapons rather than futuristic trampolines!\n\nIts all dull, dark gray with shades of blue with no sort of flavor to call its own. Its just generic flavor #9 with a darker shade. You go through different areas, finding keys to open doors marked "gold" or "silver." You also flip switches that further your progress. It all just makes the game feel that much closer to the bare minimum of what mid 90s shooters had with none of the fun. Where are the different enemies? Where are the different looking enemies? Even if the enemies are different by a slight degree, the only difference is their color, which is realistic, but its just all so boring.\n\nAlong the way there are plenty of environmental traps. Flames that come out of walls, spike traps that pop out of floors and crushing walls. Most of the traps you can time such as the flames and the crushing walls even if the walls are hidden in darkness and it took me a while to figure out what was crushing me. The spike traps cumming out of the floor feel like more of luck than timing.\n\nIf you get lost, there is no map; instead, the game has gigantic hovering coins to tell you that you're in a new area. Its like playing a first person Sonic game with guns without the loops!\n\nThere are a lot of flaws with the game such as you can see enemies spawn in from thin air. In fact let's say you've played the same level dozens of times, so you know someone is around that corner to the right. So you're prepared and ready for them. You peak around the corner to see thin air, but to your amazement he spawns in before your eyes! Torsos and limbs get stuck in mid air. Debris from smashing wooden barricades will hover every so often rather than falling to the ground.\n\nI've managed to find game breaking bugs such as shutter doors that open when you kill the enemies manage to stay shut. I have also seen enemies shoot through walls several times and even spawn in walls on a consistent basis. These problems are all consistent, but lucky for me there is a reload last save, reload the last distant check point or restart the entire level. Its a bit frustrating to restart a level because the game has messed up and restarting the last checkpoint is unable to help.\n\nRise of the Triad is also one of the only games that manages to be worse with a 360 controller and still use the Unreal engine. Every other game with Unreal plays great with a controller and that's perhaps because there's aim assistance, but Rise of the Triad becomes that much more difficult to play. Who dares plays a modern first person shooter with a controller though?\n\nThe health consists of pudding bowls or white pies; one of those two. As generic as the game is, its a step in the wrong direction from standard white boxes. It turns any health hunt into something you need to put some effort into because its a black bowl on dark terrain. Is that health? No. Is that health? Maybe. You never know until you run into it. On the plus side, you can rocket the rice bowls to light them on fire and give you extra health at the cost of ammunition.\n\nThe catch with everything negative is there are positives that I never managed to find in my short time spent with the game. There are mushrooms that make everything look wavy. There's a dog mode of some sort. You fight through a medieval castle with magical weaponry. All that stuff sounds cool, its just that I never enjoyed the game long enough to get any deeper into it. Should anyone endure a bad game for what lies beyond further in the game? It failed to capture me and seeing the positive reviews when I know how flawed the game is makes me feel like people are desperate to like something.\n\nLike most first person shooters, there are online multiplayer modes and that seems to be the sanest way to play the game. Other players have to aim at you to shoot so the game becomes a lot more forgiving. Then you become reliant on other people to have fun.\n\nThere's a reason why this game was so cheap when it was released and that's because the game itself is cheap. Its uninteresting, dull and frustrating.","February 8","false","2.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

There are moments where you are feeling invincible, and then moments (like the boss levels) which can lead you to rage quitting. It's a great remake (from what I've seen at least), play it like Doom and Wolfenstein and not like Call of Duty.\n\nThe only reason I dropped this game was because I had lost my checkpoint and had to redo an entire level over again (which was annoying because I don't even remember what the actual level that I was on looked like), if that hadn't have happend I would've guaranteed you that I'd be playing more of this.\n\nMADE FOR: People who like old school shooters such as the original Doom or Wolfentein\n\nNOT MADE FOR: Shooter fans who expect modern mechanics implemented into this remake and those who don't have a whole lot of patience.

Cannot recall how many hours I put into this on the family PC running DOS. I can still hear the soundbites and see the pixelated and absurd enemies of the original. It was perhaps the best game in our 150+ library for years.\n\nWhich is why it pains me to say that this doesn't quite match up to the original. Unfortunately, it is a game that is designed for two decades ago, with graphics from one decade ago. The quick-paced, rocket-jumping, ludicrous gibs-inducing playstyle of this just seems like it doesn't fit in today's AAA game library. Enemies often bugged out, you'd glitch into a wall, or take phantom damage and stroll around on 0%. Almost seems rushed.\n\nHowever, what does save it for me, are the throwbacks to the original, which I'd imagine is what this game is aiming for above all else. The remixed soundtrack, the ridicolous weapons, the coin collecting, and the throwbacks to classic enemies. And for those die-hard completists, there are heaps of achievements to keep you occupied.\n\nAfter beating this game, I learned it does have a spot in Steam, if you've played the original. It'll standard and quick level designs makes it the "McDonalds" of the Steam Library.

Rise Of The Triad was originally supposed to be a sequel to Wolfenstein 3D, and it shows: Aside from fighting and killing a wide variety of enemies, there's also plenty secrets and treasure you can collect by pushing walls, rocket jumping to out-of-reach platforms and simply looking throughout the levels carefully!\n\nThe game itself is fast paced, pretty difficult and a good challenge for both people new to FPS and old-school players. You'll constantly find yourself collecting health items and powerups while trying to kill plenty of enemies surrounding you with deadly force. You'll find yourself in situations where you have to solve puzzles and avoid instant-death traps to collect keys so you can progress throughout the level. And at the end of every episode there are bosses who can be really tricky to beat.\n\nAll-in-all, I think Rise Of The Triad is an excellent game, very well worth the $15 I paid for it, and even includes a few nifty features, such as being able to switch from the music they made for the 2013 version of this game to the original 1995 ROTT music. My only gripe is that multiplayer is sort of dead, but I think the good outweighs the bad in this case. 4.5/5.0","April 13, 2014","true","77.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

It is a lot like Quake but with better graphics and single player mode alongside with multiplayer. However, I couldn’t test the multiplayer mode as the multiplayer appears to be dead. Kindly, the developers have included dedicated servers which means that you can create your own server but there is no bot support. The single player campaign is level based with each chapter having five levels in it with a boss at the end with three phases. I found the fights pretty enjoyable and quite funny. Speaking about the graphics I didn’t really enjoy the in game accessibility of the options. If you want to fully customize and change anything that really affects the graphics you have to do it outside of the game before you launch it. There’s also no borderless window option. You can disable anything to improve performance.\n\nPROS: Fast-paced – (you can run past enemies and spray them down without stopping or take them down slowly one by one)\n\nSecrets – (there’s a lot of them, in every corner of the map, some of them are easier to spot while others are well hidden which makes it more enjoyable)\n\nBoss fights – (every chapter has five levels with the boss at the end and the bosses are neither easy or dull nor hard, it has three phases which takes different approaches which avoids boredom)\n\nTraps/Puzzles – (there are a lot of traps and puzzles in the game which makes you try all the different approaches to reach your destination)\n\nMultiplayer – (the game does include a multiplayer mode but it appears to be dead)\n\nMusic – (the game is accompanied with music which makes gameplay more intense)\nCONS: No bot support – (even though there are dedicated servers you can create by yourself but with a dead multiplayer and no bots it is pointless to create a server)\n\nGlitchy – (the game feels kind of glitchy sometimes. For example, melee attacks sometimes do not register or enemies take absurd amounts of damage without dying)\n\nThis review is part of the Steamified[www.steamified.com] Community Reviews.

There's a lot of firefights, but there are also a lot of avoiding obsticals and making perfect timed jumps.   It never gets to the point where it's too ridiculous to get past, if you keep trying you can beat the more difficult parts.   Ammo on your primary guns is unlimited, the only weapons that are limited are the rocket launches and other various weapons that you can pick up randomly throughout the game.  The graphics are decent, but by no means are amazing or stunning.   I like the gameplay, has a very retroish PC FPS feeling.   It is very unfortunate that the game does not have co-op multiplayer.\n\nThe problem I have with this game, is they have also brought back oldschool FPS PC gaming problems.   Sometimes when I use the quicksave and reload it, the game crashes.   Somehow the game corrupts its own quick save files randomly, no big deal though, you can still restart at the beginning of the level.   The framerate will randomly glitch and drop on you, but it’s not game breaking, and it doesn’t happen often.\n\nOverall this game is definitely worth what they are asking for it.  Anyone who likes the oldschool days of FPS shooters should definitely pick this title up.\n","July 1, 2014","true","6.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I can't help but think some of the negative reviews are coming from those who weren't reared on 80s and 90s arcade style gaming. There aren't markers leading you around the map, it isn't some grand-scale Zynga/iPad game like much of what modern gaming has become, and there are no pretensions to high art. Games in our age are either based in mindless repetition/accumulation  and/or are attempting to replace books and movies by guiding you benignly through a plot; thankfully, ROTT breaks that mold entirely. ROTT offers a sweet, simple, often forgotten goal: getting the high score. Achieving this is difficult, but the path to doing so is both straightforward and thrilling.\n\nOne comment I've seen in forums as a complaint is: "enemies shoot you from far across the map where you can't see them". I implore any readers of this review to understand: that is the point. Games aren't meant to hold your hand or play fair. If you want linear quests and cinematically placed enemies play a different game; otherwise, find and kill the hidden guy shooting you.\n\nAgain, no questmarkers. No "spam X to achieve Y". No "walk to the next cutscene". How is it that such a childish game as ROTT asks more of us than the high-budget, high-profile games that, rather, turn us into children?","July 12, 2014","true","20.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The music is nice. But damn that E2L2 - damn the last secret in that E2L2 and damn these bugged achievements.  But it's ROTT after all.\n\nI'll pass on the story because it's your organisation against the army of El Obscuro. Anyway, you can play 5 characters, each of them having different stats. For exemple, Lorelei is the faster but also the one being the most fragile while Doug is perhaps strong but slow.\n\nYou can also carry knifes, pistols, rifle gun - these have infinite ammo. But the best are the special bombs: from the firebomb (my favorite) to the basic rocket launcher, these have limited ammo, the only way to resplenish is to find the same weapon. Thanks god, you always have another type in your neighbourhood. Anyway, the weapons are powerful. And you can also use Excalibat... eeer, well, magic weapons around. Some bonus are also thrown around: from being a dog for a few seconds to a toxic mushroom without forgetting flying or god mode, you'll love that.\n\nThe enemies are usually humans, though you can have some robots at one moment and weird creatures at the end. They're easy to beat but when you're in an higher difficulty, it can be quite difficult. But the monks.... yeah, the monks.... they're too powerful. So make sure to have a powerful weapon around.\n\nRise of The Triad initially didn't allow you to have a quicksave. Now, you can but at the cost of some points. Indeed, you can set scores at the end of each level. You will love hunting all enemies, finding all secrets or collecting all coins (that are just there for statistics). Also, there are secret levels that are reminiscent of the original ROTT, in the early-90' graphics era.\n\nThe problem with ROTT is probably the jump and the bouncing jump. I don't know why but I have an hard time to time them. Well, it's mainly because of E2L2, aka The Room and probably I've seen enough lava through Scott's Mystical Head. Doug Wend is the worse in jump and E2L2 and E4L3 are a real pain in the ♥♥♥ for him.\n\nAnyway, you can see a progress in the story: from a military base to castles and crypts, the graphics are quite good. And the soundtrack is marvelous.\n\nOn a negative note, apart E2L2, jumps and monks, the enemies can get stuck sometimes. I mean by that that they will not react unless they see you and while sometimes, distance can matter, I feel the fact that they're not pursuing you through some doors a little deconcerting.\n\nReally, this game is an excellent old-school FPS and reboot for the series.","October 3, 2013","true","75.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game isn't perfect but it's a highly refreshing getaway from most cover-based modern shooters. Their are some glitches here and there, but I haven't been finding too many since I started playing (no gamebreakers or anything that I'm aware of). The boss battles are very fun and inventive and the gameplay is batshit insane (fighting a crippled nerdy nazis with a baseball bat kind of insane thing). The enemies are pretty interesting as some will attempt steal your gun and try to kill you with it, one throws grenades, one does a barrel roll, and one taunts you in hilariously executed Arnold Schwarzenegger puns. There are also loads of secrets and puns (My favorite being dedicated to Full Life Consequences Freedman). The game is easily at least a 7.5 experience... to me almost a 9! :D\n\nAlso if your going to let reviews impact your decision at least ignore IGN. They didn't mention boss battles which occur at the end of every single chapter (making me wonder if they even got to one considering in their gameplay video they didn't beat the 1st mission.) They said the enemies don't attempt to dodge your gunshots and that they don't throw grenades which both are proven false within the 1st level as Heavy's will throw grenades and officers do dodge your bullets and rockets (makes you wonder if they even beat the 1st level which is about 5-10 minutes long). They trashed this game for glitches and gave it 4.3 saying illogical stuff like "The mechanics are dated (without really explaining how so) and thrashing it for glitches, while giving Skyrim a 9.5 and writing off all of it's glitches with "Oh yeah theirs some crashes, some things that make it incompleteable but the game is real epic so 9.5!"

I've played the shareware numerous times, before getting the full version. This remake does a decent job at nostalgia. Heck Episode 2 is probably my favorite levels here.\n\nSome mechanics feel dated and the toilet humour can be annoying.\n\nIn the end games like Painkiller(2004) really overshadow this, with much better evolution of the old school mechanics. Painkiller did everything better, because if you're modernizing an old game with just fancy graphics it feels stupid that the enemy in ROTT act like the 2D sprites with their stiff animation, lack of movements and 100% accuracy.  Sometimes you enter a large area and theres a guard with a pistol firing beyond the draw distance. The robot guards have a 100% accuraccy and whats worst is that theres so much particle effects that you're screen is a purple flashbang. The monk stages are even more annoying.\n\nMutiplayer can't outdo Quake 3 or UT04, but still nice to have it in there.\n\n\nROTT is still worth getting if you played the original and oved it.

But I was both pleased and disappointed at this remake of the classic from 1994. More pleased than disappointed though which is good.\n\nI remember buying the original ROTT back in 1994 at a store and playing it for hours on end.\n\nMy first impressions of the new 2013 remake was good. It feels very much like the classic with similar controls, feel, sound effects, right down to the coins you collect and the soldiers that beg for their life. Had they left it at that it would stand alone very well and be a good remake of a great classic game...but...\nIn my personal opinoin, they went too far by adding F-bombs, bad "Duke Nukem voice and one liners, and other tasteless items sprinkled around such as books on masturbation and photos of almost nude people. There's just no point to add that junk in a remake of a classic like this.\n\nI personally don't have problems with bad words, gore, nudity or other mature content in games, (heck, I play POSTAL 2 for crying out loud,  but it felt out of place with this game and wrecked the classic feel it worked hard to recreate, at least for me.

Being able to save whenever you want instead of having to rely only on wonky checkpoints makes the game more fun and relaxing because you can lose a lot less because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t design, such as the combat in E2L2. Instead of constantly worrying that some dumb trap will suddenly murder you when you haven’t had a checkpoint in a while, you can quicksave, and if you die soon after, you haven’t really lost anything. It makes the trap and platforming sections a lot more tolerable because one mistake won’t send you back about ¼ into the level.\n\nHowever, the quicksaving doesn't excuse idiotic decisions in the game, such as the awful platforming, inconsistent way it handles how jump pads work, and the bosses. Quicksave is akin to a band-aid to bad design decisions; it doesn’t get rid of ROTT’s problems; it makes them much more bearable. The only problem it really gets rid of is the bad checkpointing, but that was a pretty big problem at launch.\n\nAnother issue is that quicksaves don’t work on bosses. I can understand why, but it’s frustrating that the most annoying part of the game, the bosses, have to be done in one go. I would’ve loved it if I could’ve saved when dealing with the bullet sponges that are NME and El Oscuro because it would save me a ton of time when the bosses would inevitably pull a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t move and kill me right before I finished them off.\n\nI’ve noticed that the quicksaves can be buggy at times. One map, E4L4, is unwinnable if you place a key, quicksave, and quickload. I’ve also seen enemies respawn after a quicksave, which is a bit annoying if you like to backtrack. Most of them aren’t a big deal, but you should be careful just in case.\n\nI have no idea how MP is now because I felt it was pretty ♥♥♥♥ even before the Firebomb spam murdered any chance of MP being played beyond a skeleton hardcore group. It seems they’re putting more effort developing the MP and trying to cultivate an MP community instead of fixing SP mode, which seems to have more potential than a bunch of hArDkOrE gamers trying to relive the glory days of UT99 and Quake 1/2/3 with a busted MP mode.\n\nI can’t say anything about any sort of optimizations since the game ran at max settings with no problems at launch. I’ve heard that the game still has some pretty big optimization problems from others, so it looks like the devs haven’t managed to fix it yet.\n\nThe modding tools seem nice, but right now the community seems to be more interested in rehashes of maps from old FPS games instead of making new stuff.There’s a lot of potential in the game, but remakes from maps from your favorite FPS games when you were a kid is not the way to do it.\n\nThe new patches make ROTT a lot more fun. Quicksaving doesn’t fix the bad level design, awful platforming, and the obnoxious bosses, but it does make the game more fun and relaxing when you don’t have to rely on poorly-spaced checkpoints when going through a bad level. Thanks to quicksaving, I feel that ROTT is a worthy purchase for anyone that likes old school FPS games, even if you’ve never played the original. There’s still several problems that probably won't be fixed, but quick saving is a good enough band-aid that it’ll make it easier to stomach them.","January 5, 2014","true","60.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

But it's dumb in the way that Dragonball Z is a dumb show or Demolition Man is a dumb film, which is to say it's brimming with fun and imagination while being totally, totally stupid.\n\nIn this game, you will run around like a maniac bouncing off of inexplicable bounce-pads to collect inexplicable Mario coins while completely explicably turning Nazi cosplayers into a steady hail of parts with explosive weapons sprinkled about every area in a way that would make an OSHA employee cry.  And no, these aren't rare pleasures, they're the core gameplay mechanics.  No, the rare pleasures are power-ups that turn you into Superman's dog or make you trip balls.  And it's all wrapped up in a gritty-gray modern "realistic" package, which simultaneously looks nice and acts as a great big eye roll at every other "realistic" shooter.\n\nIf you're used to the current age of shooters, you might have some trouble adjusting to RotT's old-school sensibilities, especially since it certainly makes no effort to bridge the distance with a tutorial or similar flower-child notions of game design.  For instance, it will never tell you the game is a cooking sim.  Explosives + food you found on the ground = hot, healing goodness!  Nor will it tell you that weapons have alternate fire or that you can quicksave whenever you like.  Its hard-on for secret areas, pathetic missile splash damage, and the sniper-like accuracy of enemies with small-arms from across the map will all become obvious as you play.  That you can more-or-less safely fire a missile at your feet to high jump into secret areas, might not if you missed out on the heyday of early arena shooters.  Mind, none of these are bad things once you know.  This is just how early shooters played and it all works well.  Even the aforementioned sniper-like accuracy isn't a problem because you play a nigh-invincible man or lady with sexual organs too large to spoon cover on a regular basis.\n\nNo, the trouble is the first-person precision platforming.  If you're new to the idea, it works about as well as trying to parallel park a morbidly obese man in a port-a-potty by furiously slapping at his jowls from piggyback, which is to say: it's difficult, inconsistent, and kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥.  The original was apparently a pioneer of first person platforming; one of the early 2.5D games to attempt multiple levels of architecture.  Unfortunately, that makes it mandatory in this game, but not good.  To put it bluntly, the platforming is bad.  But it's not so bad to negate the overall frenetic joy of the experience.\n\nThis game is worth five to ten of your dollars.  It pays all of it back in good old action-violence fun.","January 30, 2015","true","43.8"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","8","13","3","0"

But I was almost to give it maybe a 2 out of 5, for two reasons. First, jumping puzzles that are ridiculously hard. The old version didn't even have quick save option, and there was a jumping puzzle with three pits and many trampolines, you could easilly fall 50 times in a row even in the first pit and there wasn't even autosave unless you did all three. Even with quicksave, I had a hard time to jump that point. It's a pitty because the whole game was flowing nicely, running fast, having fun, and then there comes this point that everything goes into a halt. I don't know about the original game, if it had the same so ridiculous jumping puzzles, but this was such a bad game design in my opinion.\n\nAnd then I decide to continue with the game and get some horrible bugs that make me almost rage quit. There is a level with rocks on the air and lava down and monks, where you kill the monks and a script makes a door open. Many many times, these scripts fail and the door doesn't open. Restart chapter. Then the door opens, but there is another place with monks on high rocks, and next door doesn't open. Then the third door. Three doors in a row where script might fail for reasons I don't know.\n\nAnd the most ridiculous thing ever. I had my worse rage quit ever (keyboard flying, glass of quinine on my desk, yeah that sounds funny now, that's why I write it). Look what happened! I go to last boss. The flying mage. I am terrified because usually the bosses in this game are very hard and this must be the last one. I kill him easilly and I am like, hmmm that must not be it, typically there will be a mega boss. And there is one. And it's my first playthrough. And I kill him. I managed to kill him and guess what happens. The f***** Script doesn't work. He stays there with zero energy, it doesn't show the ending! I killed him with the first time without knowing and it doesn't. But no, I didn't ragequit there. Since I finished him the first time, I thought that maybe he is not that hard so I can restart the chapter and finish him again and maybe the script will work. But then, I have a hard time, always dying, can you believe that? I finished him the first time, but murphy's laws, the script didn't work, no finalle shown. And then for ten other times I cannot. That's unfair, with those bugs and the difficulty. If I died the first time and other next ten, I wouldn't have ragequit, but the thought that I somehow managed to finish him the first time but he wasn't easy the next ten times, but the first time because of a script bug the game didn't gave me the finale, made me so furious. Yeah, I know, first world problems (short story, I thought about cheating, but it would be unfair since I really did finish him first time. Then I thought about trying few more, but I was so outraged it's not good for me and I missed time. Then I thought about quiting, never ending the game, uninstalling it. Anyway, at the end I tried to play 2-3 times and finished it the 3rd and said ♥♥♥♥ that ♥♥♥♥!)\n\nI mean, it could be 4/5 because oldschool but not sure about everything (a bit like many games are "Oh, we are oldschool, like the old times", nostalgia traps. And I do prefer oldschool FPS don't get me wrong, but even the wannabe oldschool does not do it right), 3/5 because of jumping puzzles, and now 2/5 because of horrible bugs (and there is more besides the ones the made me rage, character blocked by things and stuck, little crashes or stop when loading next level sometimes).","November 10, 2014","false","7.4"," 40 of 76 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","40","76","2","4"

It does a great job at maintaining that super fast-paced and extremely exaggerated gameplay that makes old-school fps adrenalinic and challenging. ROTT could be considered a deconstruction of the old-school FPS genre. It's almost a parody that overly-exaggerates the main elements of its genre: you could consider it the Saints Row of old-school FPS. The skill required to beat this game on the hardest difficulties adds replay value and because what little there is of plot does not get in the way of the action, it's pretty suitable for speedrunning on a competitive level. The only big issue with this game is the fact that it uses the Unreal Engine 3, which has a not-so-great performance and bad netcode (which makes it pretty unsuitable for competitive play in multiplayer). It would have ran much smoother and with better networking on the unreal engine 2004 IMHO.

It's got all the elements of newer games, graphics that hold up incredibly nice, a jammin' soundtrack (that can be changed to reflect the classic game's soundtrack as well!), and best of all, the old-school run and gun, no remorse, unforgiving challenge gameplay. The multiplayer is kind of dead already though, which is incredibly disappointing, but it's not the fault of the developers, it just needs to be discovered by more people. If you're looking for "the game" to change how you play games, this is definitely where you want to start.

It was the first game that my dad ever actually bought for me.  He saw me playing the demo, pretty much non-stop, and found out what it was.  This was the infancy of FPS games, and after him seeing me beat Wolfenstein 3d, Doom and Doom 2, and Editing both of them non-stop, he knew that there was something about this game, that had to be awesome.\n\nHe stole my Demo.\n\nI was Away for the weekend at a Track meet, and when I got home Sunday night, there he was playing the game on his Computer.  I had no idea what he was playing.  He turned around and mentioned that this game was really good.  Yeah.\n\nMonday After school, I finally got to play the full game, on my slower computer, with the screen shrunk down to 80%, and It was amazing.  I played through the game long enough to get bored of gaming on PC... which now that I think back... this is the game that killed PC gaming for me.\n\nNot realizing the last statement, I bought the game on the cheap on Steam, mapped the controls to a 360 controller, and gave it a whirl.\n\nNostalgia.\n\nThe only driving force in playing this game was nostalgia.\n\nIt has the effect of Pancakes, with extra butter, syrup, vanilla ice cream and cherry compote.  Those first 3 or 4 bites are amazing.  But tastebud overload subsided, you realize, you don't really want this any more.\n\nBy the time I made it to the 3rd level, I was bored.  I had the strange feeling that the first few levels were ripped from the original game design.  Up until this point, I felt my interest in the game waning pretty fast... and then it happened.  I died.\n\nThe exact same thing happens to me, like a stored trigger point, every time I play a game for Nostalgia.  What ever caused me to press quit game the very last time I played the game, seems to do it all over.\n\nThis happens every time I play anything old.  SMB, DK, Street Fighter, it doesn't matter.  Game over means... Hey I'm playing something else.\n\nOver all,\nif you are playing the game for a budget entertainment standpoint: Buy it.\nif you are looking to revitalize a memory from years gone by: Buy it... but don't expect Pinnacle of gaming, like it was.\n","July 19, 2014","true","1.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Here's why.\n\nFirst there is a points system so you can set yourself up higher. You can also do this with the achievements. You get points based on the coins you find, how well you kill enemies, and the difficulty you are playing on.\n\nSecond it's challenging. This mostly comes from the traps at first (Leon S Kennedy probably played this game before rescuing Ashley in Europe) but later on you find yourself facing tougher enemies. You WILL feel satisfied when you beat the final boss.\n\nThird you are encouraged to use powerful weapons. Frequently you will find a powerful weapon that has about 8 shots. So you will these shots immedieatly instead of saving it because you will more than likely find another powerful weapon a minute later. Theres also plenty of fun powerups and powerdowns\n\nFourth it has autosaves so you don't have to predict how the level is gonna be and use a quicksave in a bad spot (quicksaves give a penalty)\n\nThis game is different because it requires you to dodge traps. Once you get used to it you will have the reflexes of a quicktime event.\n\nSo if you are looking for an old school shooter try this one out. You will only be dissapointed if you don't like a challenge (you can always try easy)","July 20, 2014","true","18.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As a long-time Apogee game fan, I played the original Rise Of The Triad: Dark War.

I bought this game for nostalgia, expecting it to be a cheap knock-off. I am glad I did. I'm glad I was proven to be wrong. Everything from the original is here, from the death-blade columns and GADs, to the Hand of God powerup. And they made it so much better. I love it almost more than the original.\n\nThe only con I can see to this game is the fact that it doesn't have a save system like DooM or Fallout, but more like a checkpoint save system.

A game I've been waiting for years.\n\nNo more objective markers, no more stupid hints like you have no brain to use.\n\nThe main thing I like about this game is that its challenging and fun, playing on the hardest difficulty and enjoying it as hell, bosses are very tough and difficult to kill, trying to kill the boss 25-50 times and wasting around an hour or two to kill him and this is absolutely amazing It's a bit of strain but rewarding at the end!\n\nIts a true classic FPS gem, single-player campaign is fun, there are secrets on every level.\nThe further you get into it the better it gets, weapons are cool and deadly, there are many different rocket launchers with varying characteristics some are very powerful and dangerous, you will enjoy shooting them off on your enemy's face and it will explode in a mess of guts and gore...\n\nLevel design isnt linear and it encourages exploration, there are secrets and fun stuff to discover.\nSoundtracks are amazing and METAAAAL!\nGraphics are beautiful it runs on UE3, personally it looks stunning on high settings, it takes my breath away on Castle levels but thats maybe because I love castles... I think developers have done a great job in level design, its a piece of art.\n\nI fell in love with this game I havent played such a game for a long long time, this was refreshing after long dead years of FPS-generation.\n\nI got the game several months after release and I havent had such performance issues, just minor lags on very intense situations, it got patched several times though I cant promise because UE3 is a powerful engine if your hardware is dated you may have some performance issues on highest settings, but you can always decrease the quality and still continue playing, it also features Multiplayer, and its insanely fast paced and tons of fun.\n\nRunning with a single GTX570 & i5-2500k & 8gb of RAM, almost all settings set on highest except AA.\n\nI wish from developers to add an instant-action mode, where you play against AI/Bots opponents in multiplayer maps, because I want to play after I finish the campaign for a long time...\n\nIt's more than worth its value, if you are a fan of FPS you will not be disappointed with Rise of the Triad.\n\nGreat job Interceptor Entertainment & Apogee Software.","January 1, 2014","true","11.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/praisecheadle/recommended/217140/","praisecheadle","c5","http://steamcommunity.com/id/praisecheadle/","1138 products in account","There are many games lately that claim to offer the experience of an old-school FPS, but out of all of them, I'd say this is the only one that really and truly feels old-school, and it's quickly become one of my go-to multiplayer games on Steam. This is a reboot/remake of a 1995 game of the same name and it brings back the old style of exploring a level, and oftentimes trying to find a key to open a door and move on. Exploration is encouraged and secrets are everywhere and that is awesome.\n\nThe main draw for me of this game is the crazy combat, and Rise of the Triad delivers. The arsenal is the same as in the original Rise of the Triad (plus a few new things) and the addage "if it ain't broke don't fix it" is in full effect here because these weapons are awesome. When the infinite-ammo machine gun is one of the less interesting weapons, you know you have something good. You have a pistol (which can be duel weld) and a machine gun, and most weapons beyond that is some kind of rocket launcher. You have your basic rocket launcher, but then there's the heat-seeker, which automatically targets enemies. There's also the Drunk Missile launcher, which is like a minigun, but instead of bullets, it shoots out rockets, leading to explosions everywhere.  The Firebomb is essentially the BFG 9000, but with explosions instead of green glowy stuff. There are lots more crazy weapons to discover and I don't want to spoil them for you, but suffice it to say this game has a great arsenal and each weapon feels great to use.\n\nNow, those weapons would be useless without something to use them on, and this game provides a horde of mindless fodder for you to fight. The enemies aren't particularly smart, but they do have quick reaction times and strong attacks (which is what you'd expect from an old-school shooter), so combat remains challenging. The combat is fast paced and extremely fun, and enemies explode in a satisfying way. You generally find yourself trying to circlestrafe or otherwise avoid their volley of attacks while dishing out your own. Bad guys tend to be clumped together, so using any weapon that has splash damage (which is most of them) usually leads to a satisfying splat of of limbs and body parts (or as this game calls it "LUDICROUS GIBS!")\n\nAny "classic" shooter needs to have great levels in its singleplayer. Games like Doom, Duke Nukem 3d, and Blood have levels with layouts that are oftentimes much more complex than what you see in the more linear FPS games of today, and Rise of the Triad mostly succeeds at recreating that style. Mostly. The majority of singleplayer levels are really good. They provide that large, explorational style that older shooters have with lots of secrets to find and enemies to fight. One interesting thing this game has that most shooters don't is that it has environmental hazards and helpers, such as spinning blades, crushy walls, bounce pads, and fireballs (again, these are all adapted from the original). These add an interesting flavor to the level designs and are mostly used well. Unfortunately, some levels abuse these mechanics at expense of combat. One level in particular is almost devoid of combat and combines the trap mechanics with a series of four first-person platforming segments. Normally, I don't automatically hate on first-person platforming because I generally don't have an issue with it, but  it generally isn't done well in this game, so having an entire level of it isn't a good thing (the level was extremely infuriating at launch, as the original release of this game didn't have quick-save, but the developers have since patched the game to allow for quick-save making the platforming segments more of a dull inconvenience than the rage-quit inducing problem they were originally). When the game segregates combat and environmental challenges away from each other, it doesn't work, but when it does mix the two, there's lots of fun to be had. I also found that the boss fights were a bit too unforgiving for my tastes, but you can usually find a cheap way to take them out, such as tricking them to get stuck on a corner or finding a spot where you can shoot them, but they can't shoot you. Overall, the singleplayer is usually very fun, but the bad spots do bring it down a bit.\n\nMultiplayer, on the other hand, is consistantly great, and is the main reason I want to reccomend this game. If you've ever played the deathmatch on Doom 2, Quake, or Unreal Tournament, you'll know what you're getting into and this game delivers. Each arena is extremely well designed, and the weapons that were so much fun in singleplayer are even more entertaining in multiplayer. Combat is a fast-paced explosion fest and the satisfaction of trying to do better than everyone else never gets old. Now, you might be thinking "okay, but what makes this different from those other games you listed", and the answer to that is the community. Rise of the Triad has one of the best communites of any shooter I've played. During the weekday, you won't find many (or often any) people online, but on saturdays the game comes alive thanks to the great community management putting together an event called "Saturday Night ROTT", where everyone goes online and gets into some deathmatchy goodness. There's a great mapping community for this game, and tons of custom maps are constantly being made (both original creations, and remakes of classic maps from other games). The best of these are added to the Saturday Night ROTT lineup, so there's always something new to try when it comes to multiplayer. The community really makes this game something special, and with workshop support coming out soon, things will probably get even better. The developers are constantly in communication with the fans of the game, and you'll often see them on during the saturday events. The game is constantly being improved and patched (they've already added a new weapon, and several multiplayer maps) and they developers really care about their game (at launch, there was some serious performance issues, and no quicksave to be found, but unlike other developers *cough*Ubisoft*cough*, they started fixing things right away and made the game better overall). They've been hinting that something cool is coming down the line as well, so Rise of the Triad is always worth coming back to to see what's going on.","August 11, 2014","true","35.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Even with a super beefy rig you are probably still going to have FPS issues, which is totally unacceptable for a UE3 game, and a major stain on this games reputation.\n\nHOWEVER, with that out of the way, new ROTT keeps very much in the spirit of old ROTT with being absolutely totally ridiculious. Stupid guns, stupid power ups/downs, stupid action, and arcadey level design. You have infinite bullets, but a button to reload your gun, just in case you want to.\n\nMultiplayer is also stupidly fun, and the saturday night ROTT ideas are great, but unfortunately it seems like the FPS issues get even worse in multiplayer, making it more frustrating then it should be.\n\nOverall recommended, but with reservations.","April 30, 2014","true","7.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's like the game designers played "Bulletstorm", then played "DNF", and then thought:\n\n"Wait a minute!  Bulletstorm just takes the arcade-style FPS into this generation of gaming!  If we re-made Rise of the Triad in a similar style, and ramped up the difficulty, we could really build a proper nostalgia-inspired remake!"\n\nThe graphics are not the best, and the AI is laughable.  But it plays fast and smooth, and there's so much going on it doesn't really matter.  This game takes it back to the olden days when it wasn't about enemy AI so much as it was about level-design.   And with some financial backing from us Apogee fanboys, the guys who made this have the potential to tweak the gameplay in all the right ways.\n\nIs it perfect?  No.  Is it competitive with modern shooters?  Yes.  Is it worth $10?  Easily.  $15?  Yeah.\n\n$19.99?  Definitely, given the amount of content and how the developers continued to add content to the game through patches after launch.\n\nBut, most importantly, these guys clearly care about PC gaming.  They give you countless ways to tweak the game right in the launcher menu, and on my rig, I can crank her right up to "Ludicrous" and let her fly.  On your rig, you'll have so many different ways to adjust settings to suit your configuration that you'll certainly be able to find a good balance.\n\nIf you love PC gaming, and you love about 150 gunshots a minute with over-the-top explosions...if you love twisted humor and OG FPS in-jokes and running full bore at someone you just shot and getting their eyeball stuck to your screen, then this is the game for you.","April 23, 2014","true","16.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

A game I've been waiting for years.\n\nNo more objective markers, no more stupid hints like you have no brain to use.\n\nThe main thing I like about this game is that its challenging and fun, playing on the hardest difficulty and enjoying it as hell, bosses are very tough and difficult to kill, trying to kill the boss 25-50 times and wasting around an hour or two to kill him and this is absolutely amazing It's a bit of strain but rewarding at the end!\n\nIts a true classic FPS gem, single-player campaign is fun, there are secrets on every level.\nThe further you get into it the better it gets, weapons are cool and deadly, there are many different rocket launchers with varying characteristics some are very powerful and dangerous, you will enjoy shooting them off on your enemy's face and it will explode in a mess of guts and gore...\n\nLevel design isnt linear and it encourages exploration, there are secrets and fun stuff to discover.\nSoundtracks are amazing and METAAAAL!\nGraphics are beautiful it runs on UE3, personally it looks stunning on high settings, it takes my breath away on Castle levels but thats maybe because I love castles... I think developers have done a great job in level design, its a piece of art.\n\nI fell in love with this game I havent played such a game for a long long time, this was refreshing after long dead years of FPS-generation.\n\nI got the game several months after release and I havent had such performance issues, just minor lags on very intense situations, it got patched several times though I cant promise because UE3 is a powerful engine if your hardware is dated you may have some performance issues on highest settings, but you can always decrease the quality and still continue playing, it also features Multiplayer, and its insanely fast paced and tons of fun.\n\nRunning with a single GTX570 & i5-2500k & 8gb of RAM, almost all settings set on highest except AA.\n\nI wish from developers to add an instant-action mode, where you play against AI/Bots opponents in multiplayer maps, because I want to play after I finish the campaign for a long time...\n\nIt's more than worth its value, if you are a fan of FPS you will not be disappointed with Rise of the Triad.\n\nGreat job Interceptor Entertainment & Apogee Software.","January 1, 2014","true","11.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's well worth that price. I enjoy the game. It's geared more towards fans of something like Duke Nukem.\n\nEdit:\n\nI honestly considered not updating my review on this, but I figure whenever I review something I think that I should flesh it out rather than give some small remark and keep moving onward as I have a tendency to do with my reviews. Reviews should be more length yand they should have a purpose as far as trying to tell people why or why I didn't like the game.\n\nRise of the Triad! To my knowledge, this used to be an older game and is actually a remake of that older game. I always am interested to see remakes of classic games and see what they're like. I never played the original Rise of the Triad but I did play this game. I enjoyed this game because I do enjoy shooter games and this seemed to have a little bit of a classic feel to it (reason why I say that is because I was collecting tokens the whole time. Collectables are a pretty common dynamic in older games like DOOM, etc.) I thought that was pretty neat so that appealed to me as someone who has a tendency to be more partial to classical game dynamics.\n\nSo this also has multiplayer. I didn't play the multiplayer much and without going into too much about it and getting really specific about it like I'm sure some people do, I would say that the multiplayer is a bit silly in this game. This was something that I actually didn't prefer. So if you're buying this for the multiplayer, I wouldn't recommend it. But hey! There is a silly, but interesting storyline and it does have some value.\n\nAs always, I would say look into the game and do some research, check out some gameplay videos before you buy it. Do not impulse buy! I can't stress that enough in these days especially whenever people spend money all willy-nilly over games that they probably won't like that much.\n\nLook into it before buying it, and enjoy.","July 13, 2014","true","5.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

That's really a reflection of my tastes more than anything about the game.  ROTT is more of a hard-core shooter than I'd prefer, and there's a bit too much platforming in it for me.  But, looking at the what the game advertises itself to be, it does its job well.  For the most part, the game mechanics (even the platforming) work just fine and the graphics are great.  And, considering it took me a bit over 42 hours to finish the game on Normal (Medium) difficulty with each level 100% complete, I can't complain about the dollars-to-hours ratio:  the game is well worth the money.\n\nThere are some issues with the game, though.  First, even moving away from my preferences, there's still too much platforming in it simply because it's classified as an old-style First-Person Shooter.  Most people buying such a game are not going to be the same people interested in a platformer.  So, there's a bit of audience alienation.  Still, most of the platforming is fine:  some jumps, some bounces, etc..  However, there are some levels that just have too much platforming (most of episode two comes to mind and one of the secret levels is entirely hard-core jumping).  Even worse, in several cases, there were jumps I could not do without making changes to one of the ini files.  Looking at the comments in the discussion area, though, I seem to be the only one suffering from that.  So, it might be something with my system.\n\nSecond, there's only one QuickSave spot.  All the rest of the saves are actually checkpoints (three or four per level).  Along with the normal problem with checkpoint systems, there's also the issue that when you hit a checkpoint, you're barred from going back to previous areas (a door will close, or you'll have dropped down to an area you can't jump out of).  And, even worse, there are a few areas where choosing to do things differently than expected will prevent you from getting everything in a area.\n\nThird, QuickSaving, itself, will sometimes cause things to not work correctly.  So, you'll reach the end of a level where you've been QuickSaving for safety, and find that even though you've done everything the game's given you, you're still short a coin or a kill or a secret area.  So, back you go to redo the whole level.\n\nAnd, finally, the secret areas need to be more findable.  My methodology was to play every level without help first, and looked for all the secrets.  I NEVER succeeded in completing a level 100% on my own (and I'm SLOW -- I've seen comments that one full playthrough should take 15-20 hours (and there's an Achievement for doing it in less than 4 hours):  I took 42 hours).  I absolutely HAD to watch YouTube videos to find everything.  There really needs to be more hinting to make these findable.\n\nEven so, the game is fun enough and long enough to be worth the buy.\n","March 4, 2015","true","46.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's the best of the classic-style shooters released lately. Better than Shadow Warrior (Lo Wang is a bit tiresome in his comments), Serious Sam and Painkiller. The graphics are really nice and the pacing is insane. Using multiple types of heavy weapons is very normal in the game, and you just keep exploding and burning enemies all the time. The game is very expressive, you see soldiers asking for mercy, a temporary god mode and a DOG mode (yes!). And some very cool weapons available: homing missiles, "firewall" launchers, flamethrowers, miniguns, dual pistols, the list goes on and on.\nThis is like the real sucessor of Doom and Wolfenstein, and of course, the original 90's Rise of the Triad.\nAlso it has competitive multiplayer, but I haven't tried it. Chances are, if the game's not on the Steam top 100 played games, it may be very empty. And it has no co-op mode, which is a REAL SHAME.

This game successfully brings back the long missed crazy action of twitch shooters. It's a completely insane frag-fest that doesn't bother with the nonsensical plots or uninteresting character development that seems to plague today's modern shooters. Here, you're thrown into a sadistic single player campaign where the only thing that matters is to blow away whatever dares move. To that end, you are fed an incredible arsenal of rocket launchers, magic weapons, and crazy power-ups. As a consequence, ROTT is very good at what it does: mass murder, plain and simple. The multiplayer is also a welcome comeback to the days of Unreal Tournament and Quake 3, and while it still suffers from a lack of modes variety (even after the content patches), it's inmensely satisfying.\n\nWith all that in mind, it must be noted that, although this game is a truly faithful remake of the classic 1995 shooter, it does suffer from some HUGE problems that might turn off more than a few players. I'll go ahead and describe in length all the issues that were big bugbears for me.\n\nFirst and foremost, Rise of the Triad is extremely poorly optimized, even after the patch that was supposed to fix its performance issues. Expect constant framerate drops during the levels, even if your machine laughs in the face of the recommended system requirements. Interceptor Entertainment has promised to work around this problem and give ROTT the performance you'd expect from an Unreal 3 Engine game, but truth is, the game still doesn't work as it should.\n\nAnother big complaint I have with this game is the level design. Even though the developers promised to give this game awesome non-linear levels reminiscent of the original game, it turns out most of them are fairly linear, and, although there are lots of secret areas to explore (which is always a nice thing in a shooter), I was quite dissapointed to see that the levels in the single player campaign turned out to be "modern" in a rather bad way, that is, the linear way. Even more importantly, this game heavily abuses on platforming and jumping puzzles, which, in my personal opinion, unless done in a very moderate manner, simply do not belong in a first person shooter. I understand that a small platforming section can help vary the gameplay if paced correctly (which was often the case in the original ROTT), but, considering the extent in which they have been deployed in this game, they simply hurt the quality of some levels inmensely. It's a shame that one of the few truly non-linear levels in the game (E2L2, The Room) gave me an horribly tedious time because it consists almost exclusively of platforming. Thankfully, the developers added the option to quicksave in one of the patches, making the terrible chore of platforming a little bit more passable.\n\nMy final and most minor complaint is that, because of the fact that Rise of the Triad is so faithful to the original game, it also retains some of its problems, namely the complete uselessness of the first two weapons, which are replaced by the MP40 submachine gun right in the first level. I think the developers could have gone a bit farther and given the bullet weapons some actual use (other than being the boring spare weapons for when you are out of missile or magic stuff)\n\nVerdict:\nI want to end this review by saying that, even while I spent most of the time describing the problems of Rise of the Triad, this game was overall an enjoyable experience, that manages to just barely outlive its many issues in favor of an extremely satisfying and highly violent action. I'd definitely recommend this game to any fan of the original Rise of the Triad, and also to FPS fans in general if they are willing to cope with the problems I described, particularly the poor optimization.\n\nThe Good:\n-Fast-paced, old-school ultraviolent action\n-An excellent arsenal of explosive and magic weapons that set up some crazy shooting\n-Very enjoyable multiplayer\n\nThe Bad:\n-Extremely poorly optimized\n-Fairly linear level design\n-Overuse of jumping and platforming puzzles\n-Bullet weapons feel uninteresting, with two of them being completely useless","December 27, 2013","true","46.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's well worth that price. I enjoy the game. It's geared more towards fans of something like Duke Nukem.\n\nEdit:\n\nI honestly considered not updating my review on this, but I figure whenever I review something I think that I should flesh it out rather than give some small remark and keep moving onward as I have a tendency to do with my reviews. Reviews should be more length yand they should have a purpose as far as trying to tell people why or why I didn't like the game.\n\nRise of the Triad! To my knowledge, this used to be an older game and is actually a remake of that older game. I always am interested to see remakes of classic games and see what they're like. I never played the original Rise of the Triad but I did play this game. I enjoyed this game because I do enjoy shooter games and this seemed to have a little bit of a classic feel to it (reason why I say that is because I was collecting tokens the whole time. Collectables are a pretty common dynamic in older games like DOOM, etc.) I thought that was pretty neat so that appealed to me as someone who has a tendency to be more partial to classical game dynamics.\n\nSo this also has multiplayer. I didn't play the multiplayer much and without going into too much about it and getting really specific about it like I'm sure some people do, I would say that the multiplayer is a bit silly in this game. This was something that I actually didn't prefer. So if you're buying this for the multiplayer, I wouldn't recommend it. But hey! There is a silly, but interesting storyline and it does have some value.\n\nAs always, I would say look into the game and do some research, check out some gameplay videos before you buy it. Do not impulse buy! I can't stress that enough in these days especially whenever people spend money all willy-nilly over games that they probably won't like that much.\n\nLook into it before buying it, and enjoy.","July 13, 2014","true","5.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Enemies are cruel and wacky, and aren't afraid to troll you by stealing that shiny new weapon you found a few doors back. The dev team even included a metal/rock themed soundtrack that reminds me of the ol days playing Doom. Coins, easter-egg secrets, fast-paced combat, and some awesome bosses that gave me a WoW Burning Crusade feeling to them. The weapons you find are overpowered as hell, but once you see what you're up against you'll need every last rocket.\n\nCriticisms in a more serious tone: Story and pacing of the game are hard to follow. You can easily get stuck if you're not paying attention to every little detail around you. While I think that the mobs are challenging, others can find them unfair with their super quirky movements. Multiplayer is lacking support since their community in that area practically doesn't exist. (That being said, LAN parties have been awesome, so the actual multiplayer itself isn't bad.)\n\nOverall I found this game to be fun. It's not a perfect game, but neither is it an AAA title that will bash your face in with advertisements and microtransactions. It's a remake of a game that made most shooters the games they are today (also credited for inventing CTF) if you want to buy a piece of history, then look no further.","October 17, 2014","true","2.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Originally envisioned as a full sequel to Wolfenstein 3D, it morphed into a standalone game that gathered a cult following despite its bad fortune to be released in the shadow of Doom 2. For years it dwelled in relative obscurity until a couple of years ago when Interceptor Entertainment and a resurgent Apogee announced a remake of the beloved but oft forgotten game.\n\nThis new Rise of the Triad was released last year to moderate fanfare. After the utter farce that was Duke Nukem Forever, it's fair to say there was scepticism about how an old Apogee/3D Realms classic could be revived. ROTT 1994 is a game I still play from time to time to this day, so I was curious to see how ROTT 2013 stands up just a year later, once the mists of nostalgia had faded. Put frankly, ROTT 2013 is one of the most satisfying shooter games I've played in recent years. It had me tearing my hair out at times, but the joy and insanity of the original has transferred over and makes for a hugely enjoyable game.\n\nROTT always was a always strange beast. Using a modified Wolfenstein 3D engine, its 90 degree walled levels betrayed its origins and the limitations of the technology were always apparent. The look and feel of the game also betrayed its more Nazi-iferous beginnings with the Triad enemies having a distinct whiff of the jackboots about them. On the other hand it was also a game in which ridiculously powerful rocket weapons were always on hand, you could become a god, a dog or just get high on shrooms and bounce around trap filled rooms with elastic super powers. It was slightly unhinged and it revelled in its own stupidity. ROTT 2013 brings all of this back.\n\nShooting a firebomb round into a clustered group of nasty fascists and getting a ludicrous gibs bonus is as fun today as it was in 1994. ROTT 2013 knows what people want and it gives it to you; big dumb guns and squishy meat sacks to fire them at. It's brutal, over the top, bloody and very satisfying. Every classic gun from the original is faithfully recreated and handles just as in the original. As are the enemies. The over-patrol throwing a net at you, the lightning guards nicking your bazooka to use against you or begging for their life and playing dead when injured, it's all there from the original and fits into the action perfectly.\n\nThe game is punishingly hard at times, definitely adhering to the old school rules of difficulty. There is absolutely no hand holding, it throws you into the action and expects you to come out gunning, or exploding. It may well be one of the quickest games around. The speed of the gameplay is at first a little disconcerting if, like me, you'd got used to the slower pace of modern shooters. Once you get into the groove, you'll find yourself stringing together ridiculous mid air rocket manoeuvres and jumping around shooting all over the place. Admittedly I'm not the best player, but even an unskilled player like me can be made to feel like a bazooka shooting goddess.\n\nThat is until you hit a section where the frame rate decides to go on holiday and leave you in the lurch. ROTT 2013 is hardly the prettiest or most technologically advanced game out there (just like the original in that way too), but it manages to mangle the Unreal Engine it's built on and create an unpredictable beast that can have the performance go up and down wildly. It's a horribly optimised game, terrible even. Parts of the game I could play with maximum graphical settings, others it would struggle with medium settings for no apparent reason. What's worse is that you can only change graphics options from the game launcher, so experimenting with the long list of graphics options means restarting the game. Interceptor Entertainment have patched the game and improved performance since the initial release, but it's still pretty unstable and wildly unpredictable.\n\nPerformance issues dampened my enjoyment of the game but they were more an annoyance than anything, what did cause me to groan in pain was some of the naïve level design on offer. The levels are all remakes of the levels from the original and for the most part are really well done and fantastic arenas and shooting galleries, but then you hit upon a terrible jumping puzzle or platforming section that is incredibly frustrating and leaves you thinking “Why?”. I came across numerous places where I got stuck behind props or bad geometry in the environment. If you are making a high-precision platforming section where you have to travel from jump pad to jump pad over an insta-kill death pit of doom but you have ledges to get stuck on and cause you to fall to your death, it's going to annoy players. Getting stuck by a tiny box in the middle of a fire fight with an army of baddies is going to frustrate people. Finding that a flight of stairs won't let you pass because of misaligned geometry makes players want to scream. Yes, ROTT 2013 was made on a small budget with a small team, but such clunky design is pretty disappointing.\n\nThese are far from the only problems with the game. The enemy AI is very basic, with some baddies just standing around until activated when I was almost right next to them. Character models and animation were equally basic and the colour pallet meant that enemies frequently blended into the brown surroundings. I'd often find that I was being shot by someone unseen and I'd have to stand in the middle of a room and scan around slowly, squinting to see who was left alive and still audacious enough to carry on shooting at me. Clipping issues and bad hit-boxes abound, unavoidable death traps are used to sucker punch the player far too much and the checkpoint saves are spotty at best.\n\nIf it sounds like I'm being harsh on the game, it's only because I care so much. And I know I'm not the only one. Interceptor Entertainment obviously put an awful lot of love into this remake. They are clearly fans of the original and must have doted over it a long time to get the remake to feel so faithful. There are plenty of nice touches to see, Easter eggs and references. They even give you a choice of the classic level music or the newer heavy metal covers. There are plenty of new one liners for each of the five playable characters (it's not the wittiest of dialogue, but enjoyably silly) and briefings to listen to for each level. Multiplayer mode is chaotic and frequently exhilarating.\n\nThe remake of Rise of the Triad is pretty messy in places, for certain, but the fact is that throughout most of my time playing it, I've had a huge grin across my face. It remains faithful to the original whilst tweaking the gameplay enough to make it relevant to modern audiences. If you're a fan of the original, everything will be familiar and just as fun as you remember. If you're new to ROTT, you'll find one hell of a silly good time. It's a shame it didn't receive more polish and forethought with some sections but I'm so glad that this game exists. ROTT is ludicrous, deranged, challenging and very, very fun.\n\nFrom Coffee Break Gaming[www.coffeebreakgaming.co.uk].","December 1, 2014","true","12.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

But the bad art direction makes distant enemies all but invisible, and their hit-scan weapons make for a very frustrating time, trying to figure out where you're being shot from. The old game had the same issue, but the low resolution compensated for the distant enemies problem. Now every single pixel is gloriously normal-mapped and shaded, the problem is only exacerbated.\n\nI just wish it ran a bit smoother on my system. I'll probably try playing it again next time I upgrade my rig.\n\nIf you're an old-school gamer like myself, do yourself a favour and take a look at the new Shadow Warrior. It's a much better game than this (and runs better too).","October 30, 2014","true","3.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Like the original, it will be odd to carry few weapons, but you won't notice it because in the middle of combat you'll blow up the flesh of your enemies costantly with superb demolition tools and crazy powerups.\n\nThis game it's a clear homage to an fps-era who doesn't exist anymore: the era where we had scores, secrets and mysterious levels to be discovered. Don't expect any kind of realism or sophisticated A.I. because Rise Of The Triad only wants to take you in a furious ride where the main goal is to kill everything it moves as quickiest as possible. And of course there are boss battles too!\n\nThe multiplayer modes are absolutely for people who have skill. And those comfortable with rocket jumping will feel like home, the other ones looking for the "sprint" or "reload" buttons should go away and waste their money on something else.\n\nIf you have grown up with Doom, Duke Nukem, Blood, etc you're welcome to this game, you're going to feel like at home.

I will do seperate evaluations of each section in the game.\n\nSingleplayer: Rise of the Triad is and old school FPS, which means that you will see a lot of fast movement and frantic combat, and it is ROCK HARD. the main problem with the combat is the weapons. The weapons are overall pretty weak and bland, there are not even many diverse special weapons, which is really a staple to have in games like this.. The AI is not very good, they mostly move in a certain area, and don't have advanced cover systems or anything to offer the game more challenge. The level design is very strong in this game, with jump pads and teleporters and many things like that, very old school.\n\nThe graphics on this game are not too bad, but the textures could have used some work, blood effects need some polishing, and some animations should be smoothed out.\n\nThe story of this game is almost non-existent, just a little comic at the start and not much else to offer, the dialogue made me laugh quite a bit, even though, it is repeated many times. The powerups in some places are hilarious, some can get you drugged out. Some can make you bounce around uncontrollably, it really is awesome.\n\nMultiplayer:\nThe Multiplayer is much like any arena shooters that were ever made. It consists of decent sized maps, random weapons and armor sitting on the ground, lots of routes to go find your enemies in.\n\nLike the singleplayer, all the weapons, other than the special weapons are very weak and don't really pack-a-punch, but the drops are frequent, and using a gun like a pistol instead of an RPG would sound ridiculous, they allow you to choose from many skin models.\n\nThe Combat is frantic and intense, but is set off by the weapons\n\nVerdict:\n+Great Comedy\n+Frantic Combat\n+Old School\n+Powerful Special Weapons\n+Great Multiplayer\n+Funny dialogue\n=Rock Hard\n-unbalanced weapons\n- Non-Diverse Arsenal\n-Atrocious AI\n-Needs polished graphics.\n\nThis game is not worth it for casual- or hardcore- modern gamers, but for hardcore old-school gamer, it's a must buy.\n\n6/10","March 30, 2014","true","3.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FRZ5jXxZQB/recommended/217140/","FRZ5jXxZQB","Sailor Moon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FRZ5jXxZQB/","528 products in account","This game is the kind of straight-up classic FPS that died in the 90s. People praised Painkiller for having a classic feel, but it had more in common with Serious Sam than anything. This game takes its cues from games like Quake, Doom, Wolfenstein, Blood, Chasm, etc. (and Rise of the Triad of course). One brief, skippable intro sequence is as cinematic as it gets. From that point on you just run and gun.\n\nIt's not the best game ever. The AI is pretty spotty and the game can get buggy. The voice acting is cringe-worthy, too, but unlike other recent cringe-worthy games (like the new Shadow Warrior), the voice acting is somewhat infrequent and you usually hear it during a killing spree.\n\nAlso some of the elements of the game are so out of last decade that seeing them again with modern paint gave me some kind of culture shock or something. Randomly floating platforms, jump pads, secret doors with giant floating coins and ankhs, and other things of that sort can feel a bit jarring. Each level ends with a giant door labeled "Exit" which brings you to a score recap screen, just most FPS games from 1992~1998 did. That said, once the shock wore off these oddball elements are part of the fun of the game. They contribute to what makes the game satisfying and fast-paced.\n\nIt has plenty of flaws and bugs, and I'd never claim this game is perfect (or even GOTY material). It's simply not in the same league as a game like Bioshock Infinite. But it is definitely one of the stronger non-AAA FPS games if you're into the classic run-and-gun FPS gameplay.","December 23, 2013","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay is fast, remains me of Quake.  The game consists of 4 chapters with 5 missions each, totaling 20. Each mission is unique and offers different challenges. One may be more platforming while the other may be run and gun. Enemies get harder and some have unique traits. Such as one will roll every time they get shot, one will try to steal your weapon, and one will throw a net on you…… sounds crazy but it’s fun. Each level has collectibles and secrets that contribute to your net level completion, which is shown as a percent (out of one hundred). These secrets range from simple coins to whole secret levels. The dialog is great too.\n\nSome problems I have encountered were frames dropping and glitches where you would get stuck in the ground (if you do just rocket jump). Sometimes when you alt tab it glitches and polygons render like across the whole screen. Other than that this game is great, highly recommended.\n","March 25, 2015","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While I think it's good old school FPS fun once the game rises above its buggy shell, it doesn't do it enough. Mainly it just buries its head in its old design documents, bringing the return of first person platforming (boooo), the same enemies that all have guns so shootouts sometimes become a game of 'Who Shot Me?' (double booooo). The ♥♥♥♥ing checkpointing only saves after lengthy sections, and ROTT seems determined to follow in the steps of its predecessor by arbitrarily lengthening levels and forcing the player to restart all the way at the beginning of the checkpoint (ultra boooooo) and the bugs. Jesus Christ, the pathfinding bugs, the graphics bugs, the bug where I got in a trap and clipped into the wall behind it, so many ♥♥♥♥ing bugs.

Sometimes this gets just too frustrating.\nAlso, for those that enjoyed shooting at ankhs, they seem to be pickup item only now - no bull in china shop bonus for you.

While I think it's good old school FPS fun once the game rises above its buggy shell, it doesn't do it enough. Mainly it just buries its head in its old design documents, bringing the return of first person platforming (boooo), the same enemies that all have guns so shootouts sometimes become a game of 'Who Shot Me?' (double booooo). The ♥♥♥♥ing checkpointing only saves after lengthy sections, and ROTT seems determined to follow in the steps of its predecessor by arbitrarily lengthening levels and forcing the player to restart all the way at the beginning of the checkpoint (ultra boooooo) and the bugs. Jesus Christ, the pathfinding bugs, the graphics bugs, the bug where I got in a trap and clipped into the wall behind it, so many ♥♥♥♥ing bugs.

The soundtrack is great, the graphics are decent, it still has that subtle sense of dark humor but the entertainment that is provided isn't all that great. Quoting "The Dark Tower" (Stephen King), "the world has moved on". I mean, nowadays you don't need to bother about running around like crazy looking for a specific sort of key to open a certain door, this makes the whole experience very tedious. Of course, it's really great to have several types of bazookas available but it's really lame the fact that you've gotta turn every enemy into a swiss cheese with your bullets in order to kill them. In my modest opinion, just because you're doing a remake doesn't mean that you have to bring all these old features back.

ROTT was the first ever fps game i got on pc and still have the original dos disk, this remake is pretty good if you're looking for a quick blast from the past and also runs at a great pace as well. It didn't get good reviews on first release but they have brought big patches for it and since i got it i've had very few problems playing it.

There's a lot of cool weapons that have good weight to them, and very good responsiveness. I was also able to run the game on its "Ludicrous" settings and it was a pretty nice thing to look at.\n\nThe multiplayer has a lot of really fun maps. I espescially like the "retro" maps that are all 16 bit with amazing music. The community has been really cool, and there is text2speech which is awesome and hilarious.\n\nThe entire game has that "over the top" feel and it's really quite great.

I used to play legacy RotT after it was first published. Shooting Nazis in a game with elevating platforms everywhere was a huge blast in contrast to the hallway maze games before it, although I gotta say the guards dogs always did a good job of pumping the adreniline up (Wolfenstein 3D).\n\nThis modern day rewrite of that old RotT classic really works for me. The sounds and sensations from the original are here but technically ramped up, especially the colorful fast-moving graphics. (Remember the starchy redish grays? Not here.) And the best part is the pace is still there, moving elevators and all.  Your reflexes have to be fast and continuous, almost like doing a dance - you get into a rhythm -  your movement becomes fluid and calcuating.\n\nHaving said all this, I have yet to get far in the game as a single player. I don't say this embarrassingly as the game can test your nerves and reflexes. But even playing in snippets it's a very fun FPS.

I doubt this can be addressed post-release without re-releasing all the maps, such a shame on that design choice whether intended or slipped through.\n\nCheckpoints are scarce too and the developers erred on the side of too few, regardless of what difficulty you play, if you die you will have to replay several minutes of whatever you had painstakingly accomplished already.\n\nMultiplayer seemed to have some network performance problems, expected on release week, likely to be addressed in a patch I assume.\n\nIf you can look past the above points, this game is really fun and has a lot of potential. Level editor not included in the box, but apparently should be coming out eventually -- and hopefully custom map makers do collision passes in their maps.","August 1, 2013","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They did a great job at enhancing the graphics. There's some much detail here and it blends perfectly with the dark comedy or the original version. Probably the worst part of this game is the platforming but this time it's a bit easier becuase you can look down.\n\nI had lots of fun playing this but there are some problems with loading and saving. You can load and save almost any time, but sometimes when you load, a critical story event won't trigger or some story object will revert to its original state, requiring a level restart. Often, enemies which have been destroyed, will regernate after loading a save game. You can get into situations where you clear the enemies out of part of a level, save your game, load the game and the enemies have returned. Do this a few times and you'll find yourself with no ammunition or health. While it's possible to physically attack enemies when you're out of ammo, it's not much help when you're dealing with the more difficult enemies and situations near the end of the game.\n\nBecuase of these problems, I gave up a couple of levels before the end.

The humor is pretty humorous, the weapons are powerful, enemies (while dumb) are challenging and humorous, and the levels are fun, challenging, and actually have their own unique charm. The levels actually looks and plays like a real, but crazy, base of operations for the triads, even with some areas based on the original maps. If you like classic fast paced shooters with multiple characters to choose and lots of weapons to blow everything up, please pick this title up.

You will run around everywhere at Gordon Freeman's sprint speed or faster, blast everybody you see into innumerable bloody chunks, eat nondescript food matter, burp and fart and swear and give not even a single ♥♥♥♥. And that's great! And it looks good and the gore is done very well, at least as far as I can tell through my wimp computer graphics settings. It had some serious optimization problems at launch, but somehow or another they actually really improved that.\n\nThat said, eeehhh the appeal wears off fast for me. The enemies are pretty annoying; it seems like I'm frequently being shot by things I can't see. Not to mention I guess the difficulty in general is sort of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I was warned that most of the bosses would probably cause my hair to eject from the follicles like a cartoon character, and I believe it. The core gameplay isn't engaging enough to me to even stick with the game for long enough to get to that point, though. Maybe if I had a better rig and could crank the graphics up.\n\nSummary: Pretty much does what it says on the tin; it's the FPS genre distilled back into its purest and craziest form. If you're into that, then great, but I think maybe there's a reason the genre grew up a bit.\n\nAlso to be fair the price is definitely right.","December 24, 2013","true","2.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/217140/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","Old school shooters get something of a bad rap with modern critics. Apparently being "outdated" and "antiquated" means the game is devoid of any quality or fun. I've never understood that; most of the shooters I grew up with are still endlessly enjoyable to this day.\n\nRise of the Triad is something I never played upon it's original release, but I am very familiar with the style of shooter this game emulates. Gone is regenerating health and back are health kits. No stupid sprint button as you're always flying around 40 mph. You can also carry more than 2 weapons. It's old school bliss.\n\nLevel design is a mixed bag in this game, though. While I've never been fond of platforming in first person games, I've never hated it either. Rise of the Triad features quite a bit of it and it can be hit or miss. The damn floating pads are often too small for you to properly land on and even some of the spring pads end up not sending you the correct distance to proceed.\n\nThe boss areas are also completely pointless. There is no sense in listing each episode as 5 levels when the final area is just a big battle. It is also pretty ridiculous that the boss fights are balanced against you. They all bring a sense of accomplishment, but having to restart numerous times because the bosses are just plain better than you is a bit harsh.\n\nApparently before some patches, quick-saving was not an option. I had no idea as I was able to quick-save throughout the game. It alleviates some of the poor checkpointing, which is really outlandish in how spaced out it can be. I can't think of a time when I played a PC shooter without quick-saving, so I really don't know why the game was even shipped without the features.\n\nThe game is also still poorly optimized. I got some slow-down that would bog my system in one spot, but not a foot in either direction. Sometimes enemies or weapons wouldn't trigger, which then prevented me from continuing with the level. I also had some quick-saves crash my game and then be rendered unusable. That is strange considering this game is on version 1.5.\n\nStill, the weapon selection and sheer gore factor make for an excellent time. Even with problems, the game is very fun. It is a bit short (as a lot of shooters were back in the day) and the AI doesn't seem to keep up with you, but the fun doesn't really stop.\n\nI still think searching for keys and levers makes for a shooter that engages both your mind and reflexes. Since nearly every level has you doing one or the other, you tend to just get sucked in and let time fly. If only those bugs were ironed out.\n\nSo would I recommend the game? Yes. If you like old-school games, just buy it. Maybe wait for a price drop, but grap this game. If you were raised on Call of Duty, this game is an interesting relic of a bygone era. That is has flashy graphics and deathmatch might make it worth while for you.\n\n6/10","February 4, 2015","true","7.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's essentially the same game as it was before, just made to look a lot nicer and utilize the power of the Unreal Engine. You have access to all of the classic weapons, from the dual pistols and the MP40 to big-hitters like the Split Missile and the Firebomb. God Mode? Yes. Dog Mode? YES. Even the Dark Staff and the Excalibat are back in action and ready to kick some tail. Carve a path through the Triad of San Nicolas Island and look good doing it with the classic five characters suited up and ready for action. Anyone interested in picking up big guns and blowing bad guys away with it will love this game, because that's basically its mission statement. Even if you don't care for the plot, you don't really need to pay that much attention to it. Just kill everything and have fun.\n\nI will say that the game was slightly buggy in earlier patch versions, but that much has been significantly improved over time. Apogee has paid a lot of attention to what its players have had to say and it's a much more entertaining game because of it. One of the more fun additions is the Doomstick, just for those guys out there who have been lamenting the lack of a good combat shotgun. It may be a new addition, but I think it's a good one. This and many other updates are proof that Rise of the Triad is the product of tender loving care from the guys at Apogee Software and Interceptor Entertainment.

If I had to find anything wrong with it, I would bring up the campy 4th wall breaking satire in the game. I know the idea of the series was to be as completely ludicrous as possible, but some things such as the "If your reading this, your score is probably crap" or "Hold the Action key here to spawn a BFG" really almost took away from the game more than it helped. All the while the later stages are beautiful and for a game to remain as faithful to the original as much as this did, in the end...you couldn't ask for more.\n\nIf you're a fan of 90's first person shooters, Definitely buy this.\nIf not, buy it and play on easy as this game will whoop your ♥♥♥.","June 6, 2015","true","19.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Most levels are also chock full of secrets and other goodies making for some good replayability for any completionists out there.

Did/Do you enjoy Rise of the Triad: Dark War? If yes to either of those, or both, you might want to check this game out. It has the same power-ups, power-downs, weapons, and enemies from the original (Plus it has a shotgun now). Even the awesome music from the original is there, but modernized and even better. I LOVE THE MUSIC! The gameplay is very similar to the original, with running around killing everything and avoiding traps, with hardly any story. There was one room that I HATED. It was all about platforming up to the next level, on jump pads. It was REALLY BAD. There are other small platforming bits here and there, but that was the only one that I really didn't like. I also had problems with some doors opening towards the end, and the game crashed on me a few times. The game is also really hard, and it challenges you. In a good way. When it comes to the multiplayer it is hard to find people, they are usually playing on saturday. But when you do find people it is fun classic arena style multiplayer! Overall, there were some problems but the rest of the game outshines them.

The story is a bit far-fetched but hey we're just here to kill Nazi's. Over the top is a good word to use for most of the game itself from some of the bosses/minibosses to the level design being in a way to really encourage making full use of horizontal and vertical movement that a lot of games don't have nowadays, particularly if you're trying to find every thing on each level. Because of it RotT encourages exploration and shooting up everything to find out what destructable items might be hiding from you.  Enemy AI is a bit lacking, at times cheap, and sometimes you have to take advantage of it doing weird things that let you get free shots.\n\nRotT is fun in its own way but has flaws that also make it a difficult game to really like.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ragebanken/recommended/217140/","ragebanken","Rage Banken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ragebanken/","181 products in account","Violent, bloody, messes abound in this reboot of the classic FPS.  This game is definitely not a terribly in depth story.  It's not supposed to be.  As with the original, the story is a bit interesting but cliche now.\n\nThe Pro:\nLike most games on the Unreal Engine; the movement is smooth, the graphics nice, and the pace fast.  A good smattering of pop-ish references and humorous bits keep the mood light and enjoyable.  "Fappercise: Masturbate Your Way To Fitness"\n\nThe Con:\nAs with most advanced physics based engines, geometry of ancillary items causes weird hang-ups.  A skeleton on the ground can leave you stuck in place, or you can end up falling off / landing on the same ledge forever.\nReloading quick saves too many times seems to cause spawning problems.  Quick saving too often seems to corrupt the quick save.\n\nLudicrous El Oscuro:\nHe must be addressed.  I've seen many people complain that he is a broken boss.  I've seen many people claim he is just really hard and requires practice.  I have seen NO ONE that can defeat him on ludicrous consistently.\nI personally feel that both sides are partially right.  To start with, you can practice until your hands fall off, you are still a victim of the geometry, physics that will randomly land you in the lava, and glitches that leave the boss unable to be damaged.  You can however increase your odds greatly through practice.  This helps immensely to decrease the time for any of these problems to manifest.\nI couldn't help but feel in fighting this boss that I spent more time trying to fight the geometry of the area and avoid glitches than the boss himself.  Not to mention that if he starts a melee attack and your within three of his body lengths then it's an instant kill.  It's annoying to watch him flail his forelegs from a distance and magically drop dead.  Many times he will actually perform several attacks simultaneously.  I've seen him melee while in the middle of spewing his spawn and flames are still shooting out of his rear from the spin he thought he was going to do before melee... WTF?  That is a broken boss fight for sure.  But practice will definitely increase your odds greatly!\n\nOverall, I do recommend this game!  It is classic FPS brought into the current age very well.  It is smooth, humorous, challenging, and requires little emotional investment.\n\nP.S.  "El Oscuro" does not translate to "The Dark One".  It translates to "The Dark".  Beyond that "Oscuro" is more a "Dark" as in "The dark continent" than "without light"  which makes it more of saying "El Oscuro" is "The Unknown".","March 10, 2015","true","65.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The game is fast, frantic and hugely fun! Even though the visuals are not outstanding, they deliver just right and the soundtrack is awesome with metal tunes pumping all along the way. The objective is clear, shoot the baddies, find the exit, just like good old times and proving that blending old and new elements works just fine! Some people complaint about bugs and glitches and those may occur sometimes (I've found some on my own) but as of v1.5 the game seems to run pretty good even on maximum settings.

It definitely doesn't disappoint with that the levels have a ton of secrets, branching paths, keys for doors halfway across the map, and a lot of gameplay choices that died out since the 90s for example, reloading literally does nothing, and was just included for kicks. Ironsights were also thrown in, but outside of singleplayer you'll get destroyed if you use them. Multiplayer is a rocketfest, which can be frustrating at times, but once you learn your way around that's when it gets fun. The devs are the best part of the game, honestly there's lots of jokes thrown in, like the AI telling you to stick with a controller and text-to-speech in multiplayer (John Madden! John Madden!). However, it is a bit buggy on launch day, as I found myself getting stuck in walls a lot in singleplayer. I also can't really see a competitive future.

I had little expectations when booting up this remake of Rise of the Triad. To my surprise it was very enjoyable and true to its roots. This is how we all remember it; run, gun, find key, move on to the next level, repeat. But as always there are some frustrating platforming and traps here and there that may slow your progress. But they are seldom any harder than you can figure a way through/around 'em.\n\n\nRise of the Triad is a true homage to old school FPS, and while there are certainly issues, and the cutscenes is campy at best, It's an enjoyable ride and definitely worth a shot for those with fond memories of "the old days".The Humor is dark and the characters are over the top, thus laughable and very entertaining.

Some of the bosses, particularly the final boss, can be a little frustrating but they're not terrible. I played through on "normal" difficulty but didn't seem to get an achievement for that.\n\nDid I mention that this game is a bit buggy? You might get stuck in things sometimes but spend some time trying to get out or rocket jump out. Also, quicksaving is buggy in certain levels. I played through with a GTX 780 and the game had a lot of performance issues until I lowered some visual settings.

I had little expectations when booting up this remake of Rise of the Triad. To my surprise it was very enjoyable and true to its roots. This is how we all remember it; run, gun, find key, move on to the next level, repeat. But as always there are some frustrating platforming and traps here and there that may slow your progress. But they are seldom any harder than you can figure a way through/around 'em.\n\n\nRise of the Triad is a true homage to old school FPS, and while there are certainly issues, and the cutscenes is campy at best, It's an enjoyable ride and definitely worth a shot for those with fond memories of "the old days".The Humor is dark and the characters are over the top, thus laughable and very entertaining. Now, be it you enjoy blasting your friends in deathmatch, or exploding bad guys with one of the many RPG found in the game. There are always something you'll find entertaining.\n\n:Game Quality: 3/5\n:Controls: 3/5\n:Effort: 5/5\n:Re-playability: 3/5","February 28, 2014","true","12.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's a straight-forward, no-frills shooter. You play through the game killing stuff. No drawn-out story or cut scenes.\n\nThis game can be challenging and there are at least a few platformer challenges. Some of the bosses, particularly the final boss, can be a little frustrating but they're not terrible. I played through on "normal" difficulty but didn't seem to get an achievement for that.\n\nDid I mention that this game is a bit buggy? You might get stuck in things sometimes but spend some time trying to get out or rocket jump out. Also, quicksaving is buggy in certain levels. I played through with a GTX 780 and the game had a lot of performance issues until I lowered some visual settings.

I'm happy to say that ROTT doesn't disappoint.\n\nThe combat is fast paced and the weapons feel enjoyable to use. There are no "press a button to stick yourself to a wall" cover mechanics, although obviously you can still use walls for cover in a more natural way.  Enemy AI is pretty dumb but there are lots of them so if you're careless they can punish you. And when you take damage, there's none of the regenerating health nonsense. You need to find health packs, which come in the shape of food. And if you shoot the food with a rocket before you collect it, you can "cook" it so it heals a larger amount, which is a nice touch.\n\nOne area where I felt ROTT's combat was lacking is tactical depth. There isn't much variety in either weapons or enemy types so there's almost no requirement to figure out "this weapon works best against this enemy". Robots can only be damaged by rockets, but the rocket launcher pickups are so frequent that you'll probably just use them against every enemy anyway.\n\nLevel design is fantastic, like a puzzle box where you have to find switches and coloured keys to unlock doors. The environment is often as dangerous as the enemies, as you squeeze between spinning blades or make precise jumps across narrow platforms over instant death spike pits. There are secrets to find and you can rocket-jump to reach high ledges.\n\nYou can choose between five playable characters who each have different stats for movement speed and damage tolerance. I chose the British guy because that is my nationality and his 2 star speed / 4 star endurance seemed like a good pick for my playing style. There is no skill progression during the game.\n\nThe story is as basic as you'd expect from a 90's FPS. Terrorists (who don't actually look even vaguely Chinese) are planning to do bad stuff, kill them. The heavy rock music adds to the intensity of the combat. I had some occasional issues with framerate stuttering, but after checking the forum for advice I disabled motion blur, and afterwards it seemed more stable.\n\nOverall ROTT is a pretty good choice if you're in a "turn off your brain and enjoy the action" mood, especially if you're a fan of the old school. The singleplayer campaign is a little short, I got an achievement for finishing in under 4 hours, but my actual playing time was 8 hours (I guess it didn't count time lost to deaths). Either way, I'd suggest picking this up on a sale.","December 1, 2013","true","13.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Rise of the Triad is as intense as your first cocaine trip. 11/10 enemy was on his knees surrendering then killed me from behind - got an achievement for it too.\n\nI got this game gifted to me by a generous friend, and was excited to reminisce in nostalgia at the old-school, arcade-style FPS gameplay I expected. I was very satisfied with my gameplay experience.\n\nIf you like fast-paced FPS gameplay, score/combo multipliers, making your own maps, and endless bloodshed, then you will really enjoy this game. I played the original, and the remake does fantastic justice to the 90's era of FPS gameplay.\n\nThe aesthetics are good - the remade assets provide an updated old-school arcade experience. The game is not graphic intensive, but still provides decent weapon effects like the "god mode" blast and the RPG rocket explosion. The music and sounds are good and add to the intense, speedy atmosphere created by the game.\n\nControls are typical of an arcade FPS and easy to learn. I tried using a controller, but much prefer the keyboard and mouse combo for this game. There isn't a tutorial, however, the learning curve is minimal (to moderate) enough that one isn't absolutely necessary. You can adjust the difficulty to suit your needs - the hardest difficulty is fairly unforgiving.\n\nBefore you begin, you select a character with different specializations (ex: some are faster, tougher, etc). The game only supports one active playthrough at a time, so selecting a new game will overwrite your old one. Gameplay consists of you progressing through levels to the end area, killing numerous enemies along the way and collecting coins if you wish to increase your total score. You will frequently need to find and trigger switches to advance in the level (also spawning more enemies). There are many secret areas for people who like to explore (these also sometimes reward you with heavy weapons).\n\nSomething I found very amusing is the reload mechanic - you don't ever need to reload, however, you can reload as often as you like (purely aesthetic). Enemies will have to reload between clips. Sometimes, an enemy may get on his knees and plead for his life. If you spare him, he will most likely attack you once a bit of time has passed (or your back is turned). You can aim down the sights of some weapons with the right mouse click, however, that may also be the secondary fire for a particular weapon (ex: explosive shotgun). As you take damage, you will have to find food to eat, healing you instantly. There is a "god mode" weapon you can sometimes find in secret areas, which give you temporary invulnerability and a powerful blast attack.\n\nTrue to the 90s era form, you will not regenerate health, there is no radar or waypoints, and gameplay is very, very rapid. Another thing I found very amusing the the lack of recoil - most weapons have a minimal spread. The shotgun has a "camera shake" that occurs after you fire, which I think is supposed to mimic recoil (but is happens shortly after you fire, and seems a bit ridiculous).\n\nOverall, if you enjoy fast twitch shooters reminiscent of old-school arcade FPS games, then you should give Rise of the Triad a try.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","April 18, 2015","true","2.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

If this were an early access game in late alpha or early beta, it would be off to a promising start, but this is supposed to be a finished product and it isn't. It isn't anywhere near being. It took me an hour and a half to hit a game breaking bug, and before that I ran into dozens of more minor ones. Even when it isn't breaking, what's there doesn't seem quite finished yet. The sound effects are of inconsistent quality, enemies behave erratically, and the level design isn't as interesting as I'd like it to be. This is theoretically a finished release, though it does still seem to be getting patched which is a very good thing. I want a renaissance of secret filled old school shooters as badly as anyone, but this is too frayed around the edges to fully scratch that itch.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brogbo/recommended/217140/","Brogbo","DrBrogbo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brogbo/","1650 products in account","Rating - 74/100\nRecommendation - Fans of old-school FPS will love it\nTagline - 1994 ROTT in a brand-new engine\n\nWhen I first reviewed this game, I was quite hard on it. The original Rise of the Triad is one of my most beloved games ever, and this updated version was not what I expected. However, a combination of the developers being active in the community, patching in quicksave functionality (USE IT OFTEN), and me going back to revisit this and the original game have caused me to change my review.\n\nOriginally I did not recommend this game, but now I do, with a few caveats.\n\nThis game is certainly not for everyone, as it is unashamedly old-school in its entire approach. Character movement speed is insanely fast, level design is mostly flat and spread-out, enemy AI is fairly simple, there are a large number of insta-kill "traps", there is no regenerating health (and health powerups are somewhat scarce), and the base weapons are weak but with infinite ammo.\n\nFor those of you out there who played the original game, this is about as close as you can get to an updated original. There are the same weapons (with some new 4th-slot guns), mostly the same enemies (including that annoying guy that steals your guns), the same types of environmental traps, the same powerups (shroom, dog, god, etc), and a similar style of level design. Graphics, sound, and music have all been updated as much as possible (and quite well, I might add), but the core gameplay remains inherently familiar.\n\nWhile that is certainly worthy of praise, and it may be exactly what a large number of people wanted, I went through quite a range of emotions about it. When I first pre-ordered it, I was ecstatic, then when I first played it I was disappointed (expecting things to be more updated), and then after going back and re-playing the original and this version, I was more accepting of the update. About halfway through that chain of events, I had had an epiphany. I loved the original, but was having a hard time feeling that same love for the new version, so what was the problem? At first I thought the game was poorly updated, but I soon realized that the real problem is not that the game had changed, it's that *I* have changed.\n\nBack when ROTT was first released, I was a kid, and I loved everything about it. The music was fantastic, the sound effects were funny, the weapons and environments were inventive and interesting, and multiplayer was addictive. There was literally not a thing about the game that bugged me. Fast forward nearly 20 years, and I am a different person. I do not find insta-death environmental traps fun, I do not find first-person jumping puzzles remotely enjoyable, I am not a big fan of competitive arena-based deathmatches, and I am overall much less accepting of small issues and complaints that I would have let slide as a kid.\n\nThat is not this game's fault.\n\nAs I mentioned above, I went back and re-played the original game, and once I took off my rose-tinted nostalgia goggles, I started to notice a lot of things that bothered me about that version too. I know all the tips and tricks related to the original game, and I could probably play through the first few levels with my eyes closed, but if I did not already know the ins-and-outs, I can honestly say I would never be able to make it all the way through today. The original game also had insta-death environmental traps, jumping puzzles, and a good number of small issues as well. It too was immensely difficult and brutal, and it didn't care what you thought about that.\n\nFor this version, Interceptor Entertainment set out to bring ROTT, essentially intact, forward into the future, and that is exactly what they have done. If that is what you are after, it is definitely worth picking this game up. There are certainly a few problems, but they are minor (explosions will not travel through/around chain-link fences or railings, it is very hard to tell where you are being shot from despite the directional indicator, and at least for me the game still crashes from time to time). The music is phenomenal, the graphics are quite pretty, the environments are familiar yet way more fleshed-out than '94 ROTT, and the gameplay can be quite hectic and fun. With the music blaring, it's hard not to smile while you are tearing around a room in a full sprint, jumping in the air and blasting groups of enemies to gory little pieces with a drunk missile launcher.\n\nJust be warned that this game is old-school in almost every way, and like most old-school games, it couldn't care less if that turns you off.","April 29, 2014","true","4.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","10"

Rise of the Triad from 1995. It keeps the nostalgic feeling for those who played it in the 90's (which I didn't) and offers really good gameplay exactly what you expected from the word of mouth of people and screenshots.\n\nThis FPS reminds me how Bioshock Infinite got 10/10 across the board. As anything on this Earth NOTHING is perfect and giving a game (that is overhyped, like GTA 5) a 10/10 is ludicious re-evaluation is highly needed.\n\nI think this game is better this Bioshock Infinite. I've played this for 30 seconds and was immediately put into action and having fun. This game rewards exploration and poking around walls, corners, vents, you name 'em. Which is the opposite with gemes like COD and BF; where the single-player is chuck-full of cinematics and scripted events and shooting galleries! *cough* BIOSHOCK INFINITE *COUGH*.\n\nIt has good enemy variety. Excellent map design. Good soundtrack, very smooth gameplay. 70 FPS on high settings on 900p.\n\nIf I could give any game a 10/10, Rise of the Triad would be one of them. Though I think it's a 9/10. It lacks some customizations I would've loved like changing the weapon model FOV but I don't mind it as it is now. Also some minor bugs, like getting stucked in certain spots in a map. And I don't like the checkpoint system, you can go 20 mins ahead in a map and if you die you go back to the spawn point and have to redo everything from the beginning. The enemies look like Nazis, the flags look like the Nazi flag and the Triad logo looks like Illuminati! lol","February 20, 2014","true","2.5"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","4"

The once sprawling, secret-filled maps of yesteryear have given way to liner corridors, with cutscenes every few steps. In trying to emulate blockbuster movies, videogames have lost sight of so much of what made them such worthwhile experiences. Regerating health has replaced healing pickups, and button mashing quicktime events have infected every inch of the FPS experience. Not to mention that most modern heroes are such wusses that they can't even wade into the crossfire without dying instantly, preferring to hide behind cover trading shots like spineless cowards. Thank god for Rise of The Triad, and for the awesome and ballsy team at Interceptor Entertainment for bringing it to us.\n\nThe first thing you're gonna notice when you start up Rise of The Triad is that the launcher lets you customize EVERY LITTLE DETAIL of the graphics settings. That's right, no craptastic consolization here. Once you get into the ingame menu you can finish setting the basics like resolution, brightness and stuff, as well as choose your FOV. Again, no consoleized BS here. The new soundtrack is utterly badass, with remixed tracks by Andrew Hulshult of Burying The Trend. The use of the Unreal Engine also makes for eye candy, Rise of The Triad has NEVER looked this good. It's good to see that the folks at Interceptor give a damn about what makes PC gaming sofa king awesome.\n\nFor one thing, the sprawling mazelike levels that made oldschool gaming so much fun make a triumphant return, with dead ends, keys to match up with doors, and a total boatload of secrets. Seriously look EVERYWHERE around you, chances are that little out-of-the-way nook or cranny is hiding something badassedly awesome. The team at Interceptor have hidden awesome references new and old alike all over the levels (Dopefish Lives!). Oh, and then there's the other thing that makes PC gaming especially kicking rad: MODS! Rise of The Triad fully supports modding, and even has it's own easy to use drag-and-drop level editor so that you can make your own insidious arenas of mayhem and death!\n\nOk, all that stuff sound fine and dandy, but how does it actually play? Well imagine someone took the original Rise of The Triad, made it prettier, added better mouse aiming and WASD controls, and then basically turned everything up to 11 AND added more cowbell. Rise of The Triad looks and plays effing amazing, with a perfect challenge level for any player out there. There's a veritable army of foes waiting for you to take them on, and enough firepower to deal with them all. And that's just the singleplayer, there is also a full fledged badass multiplayer experience to be had, and let me tell you it is utter forking bliss. What other game lets you turn into a dog, zip across a bridge at breakneck speeds, and then tear your enemies a new one with your razor-sharp maw? CoD's dog is a wussy chihuahua compared to this beast. Oh and if you want you can do 'shrooms while you blast your foes into chutney.\n\nSo let's chalk things up here: Big freaking guns, frickin awesome powerups, four massive single player episodes, enough multiplayer to choke a horse (one of those big Clydesdale things, not some rainbow colored friendship pony), more guns, mayhem, Dopefish, secrets, adjustable FOV, ludicrous gibs, and a guy who is seriously named I.P. Freely. How could you possibly go wrong with this fluffy stack of murder pancakes? If you don't go out and buy this game now, you are seriously missing out and should really reconsider your priorities in life. Rise of The Triad earns a solid 11 out of 10, and also pre-emptively wins the Slipgate Complex FPS of The Year awards for the next decade, or until they come out with a sequel. Go. Buy it now. El Oscuro is a very inpatient guy, you don't wanna get on his craplist.","November 25, 2013","true","9.7"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","3"

However with a evga gtx 970 ftw I can run it on ludicrous settings now. But the problem is that it randomly crashes on those settings so I have to play it on high settings. So far it has also crashed around 5 times on high settings. As far as performance goes, it runs mostly at 60fps on high settings but sometimes has really odd bad slowdown that is dependent on the weapon you are using and the place you are at. On the first boss when you first start it and a load of guys come out, I killed them all with the 4-way napalm gun and it made my fps drop from 60 to probably 30 permanently so I reloaded the game and killed them all with the machine gun and it didn't happen then. Several other times in the game give bad frame rate as well. Right after the boulder rolls down behind you then blocks the way and you are in a new room, the framerate takes a dive to down around 30 or less. This game is, for sure, one of the most horribly coded and/or optimized games I have ever seen.\n\nThe two things that buried this game in the ground and made reviewers like IGN give it a 4.3/10 which is accurate even two years later after all the patch work they have done are the horrible jumping puzzles because of horrible jumping controls, and the awful environment hazards, and sometimes a combination of both making it a double nightmare. In-air navigation is very janky and causes you to miss platforms very easily after jumping. Hitting jump pads in this game during tough jumping puzzles is a nightmare. I constantly overshoot platforms or miss them early or to the sides if they are rotating. Rotating blades are not fun at all. They can sort of lift-glitch you in the air and do dmg to you while you are sort of stuck on them. Fire traps are poorly thought out too. There are even some points where the floor gives out to a spike pit but there is no way to know it is coming, just a trap to get 100% of players the first time playing which is horrible and should never, ever be put in any game. At one point this game did not have quick saving and had horrible checkpointing. After many complaints, they added quick saving. It still has God awful checkpointing, so make sure you are using the quick save option frequently now that it is in the game.\n\nEvery level in the game is just a different variation of the color gray or similar dull colors. The levels are not designed good at all, filled with torturously bad jump puzzles and cheap environment trap deaths. The enemies are all gray or some variation of tan/gray and they blend in with the background, meaning I often get pelted by gunfire longer than I should because I have to try to find where the guy is because he blends in with the walls/backgrounds. The graphics are nothing special at all and in fact are just dull, bland and depressingly lifeless. Enemy AI is dumb too. They just stand and fire or barrel roll to the left and right a hundred times until you kill them. Sometimes the dead enemies or flags will glitch out and stretch across the whole level in a crazy weird glitch fest.\n\nIt is too bad the problems I mentioned overshadow the rest of the game because the combat is great. Firing bazookas into dudes faces never gets old, that is until it is ruined by crashes or horrible jumping puzzles or awful horrible environment traps/deaths that rip you out of the action entirely. The boss fights in the game are not good either. The first one is fine, but the rest are bad.\n\nThis could have been a great reboot but it just isn't. If you want to see how a reboot should be done, play the newest Shadow Warrior game. And play the original ROTT, not this one.\n\n4/10 awful","April 16","false","19.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","3"

Just finished it yesterday and for anyone wondering if it's a faithful yet still fresh enough recreation of the original I can definitely say yes. It doesn't screw around, doesn't try to be more than what the original was at its core (like some other remakes try to do with hours of cutscenes and deep intertwined plot). Just tells you that you're part of a badass quartet, drops you in a level and gives you a gun. Except here you get some purdy graphics and awesome satisfying gibs and weapon kills. It's also definitely no pushover in the difficulty department just like its predecessor.\n\nIf you played the original and have always wondered what it would be like if it was made in 2013 here you go. Those who are expecting anything else but an epic run and gun marathon will likely be disappointed. This is a visually and gameplay updated version of one of the codifiers of the arcade shooter. With all that implies. If you want recursive betrayals, drama and tearjerking with regenerating health and four shot deaths. You best look at Call of Duty.\n\nI made a partial series of this for Project P. I didn't record the other 3 worlds because even though they were all awesome and varied I can only say so much about the game before I say all there is to say and just want to sit back, listen to the music (which is also good, oh man is it good) and enjoy it silently.\n\nOne more thing, wait through the credits. Trust me on this. It's amusing and at the same time kind of touching.

But this is not enough\n- some places looks out-of-proportions (or at least, scaled accordingly to the inflated ego a dictator).\n- the buildings layout seems to come from the deranged mind of a aspiring architect (how can you have slicers in an office corridor if you intend to rule the world ?).\n- the moving platforms are obviously the most convenient way to go from one place to another (plus, they are solid when you move up and down, but turn vaporous when they move through you),\n- the jumpers are the secret weapon of the Triad, no doubt.\nYes, when there is a realistic environments, anything odd suddenly jumps at your face, and ROTT does that with a rare persistence.\n\nTo stay coherent with the environment, the enemies are stiff, ugly and stupid. And since the levels are huge, they are usually located at long range, forcing me to wait until they shoot me to know exactly where they are and gun them down. It's the first time I had to regularly expose myself and wait for a fireshot to figure out from where the danger comes. And this not what I would call exciting, or old-school. More eyesight-impaired retirement school.\n\nThe more I played, the more I felt that our world is not really threatened by the Triad since all that operation is doomed to fail solely based on its stupidity.\n\nTo be true to the original game, this one still features the collection of oversized coins, and the proverbial secret rooms. If the latter is nice, the former seems out of place. Collecting Nazi gold in Wolfenstein or Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army is nice and historically pertinent ; but here it's ridiculous and superfluous.\n\nOn top of that, the walk-on-that-weapon-to-get-it mechanic creates an unfortunate and meaningless "get/drop" cycle that forces you to carefully dodge some of them - or stay in position and enjoy both the comments and the gong while the game patiently swaps the weapons.

There are many titles today descending from early shooters that knew how to render the franchise according to both players' expectations of the original title and the evolution of the genre - like Shadow Warrior.\n\nI think this game should have been titled "Crash & Burn of the Triad" and fall into oblivion along "Duke Nukem Never Again".","February 7, 2015","false","7.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Every time it tries to do something it just falls flat on it's face, MP40 that can be reloaded, but has infinite ammo in both magazines anyways, pistols with the same issue, a run speed which is way too high for what the game is set in, which is often inside bunkers and sometimes has jumping puzzles which are painstakingly hard because of controlling, enemies with pin point accuracy in a game where bullets should be dogded but can't be and just design choices all over that makes barely any sense...\nSerious Sam is a great game and does so many things right. This game is similar, but controls much worse, has less interesting enviroments and enemies, and weapons feel off on all occasions.\n\nI see what was attempted, but I can sadly not recommend this game. I would rather play Serious Sam, Doom, Quake, Wolfenstein, Duke Nukem or similar games if I were you. Sadly, no newer old school titles have been made lately, and I hope that the new Wolfenstein will be good. We need more old school titles, like this one, but this sadly isn't a good enough attempt.","April 26, 2014","false","2.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

However, I still recommend it because I can see what the market is.\n\nThe game is a first person shooter based on a really old first person shooter from the 1990s. And it is extremely nasty. This game is the equivalent of a school bully. It is harsh, full of traps, kills you very easily, beats you down to the ground without telling you what you've done wrong and tries all around to be a ♥♥♥♥ to you in every way. Does that mean the game is unfair? Short answer, no. I couldn't follow the story, all you need to know is that the game has nothing to do with Triads. Literally, at all.\n\nThe game as an extremely fast pace, unlimited ammo, and health pickups. But the big reason I don't like it is because the game is, like I said, an equivalent of a school bully. Firstly, you do not have a lot of health and you have to constantly be on your toes, you never have a chance to sit still and have a breather from all the action. Secondly, you can easily hurt yourself using your own rocket launcher and there are traps everywhere waiting to kill you. There are also really difficult jumping sections, sometimes followed by minibosses, as if the game is trying to say to you "I hope remembered to quicksave!". Also, this is a personal thing but I honestly feel like the levels were too long and all looked the same to really enjoy and appreciate. However, I know people will disagree with me on that one. This is the complete opposite of Call of Juarez Gunslinger in terms of mechancis. The only things this and Gunslinger shares is the pacing and obviously that it is a first person shooter, everything else on both games are in contrast to each other, and I do not like this side of the coin!\n\nI honestly have not played the game enough to give it my full review, however, I feel like I cannot play the game anymore because, simply put, I am not the market of this game. I still recommend the game though because I can see why people like it. This game is intended for people who grew up playing the old-school FPS games, enjoy a nice challenge and also can cope with frustration and hardcore atmospheres in games.","June 21, 2015","true","3.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Unable to run the game or in some cases modify the advanced graphics options because it crashes. When the game is running properly, it's a decent old school shooter to its favor and detriment. Favor as in that lot of the weapons have a satisfying oomph and power, and detriment as in that the design feels dated.

Don't. I just played thirty minutes of it and I already had to walk away with a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nThe game's Advanced Settings are located in the launcher menu and not within the game itself, so you're greeted to a nice motionblur and bloom after when you're able to resolve any framerate issues. Lovely. Can't do anything about the game's terrible lighting, though, which makes everything blend together and like you're peering at the game through squinted eyes. With rain splattering your screen.\n\nBad lighting also clashes with the grayish enemy models, which at a distance look superimposed and close up look like a rudimentary Blender job. Given how slow enemies move and react, the player moves WAY too fast. Yes, games like Quake1 and Doom moved plenty quickly too, as did the original RoTT, but play this game and compare it to those and you'll notice the discrepancy is far greater, which isn't helped by the aforementioned character model clashing. Weapon zoom instantly locks to ironsights, then slooowly zooms in, which is just weird. Your knife, meanwhile, has wonky hit detection. You have to aim directly at an enemy or else the hit won't register. Typical melee in shooters is achieved through some hitscan trickery by creating a delayed bullet at the location where you aim. It's just that this bullet is usually nice and wide so you don't encounter the issue RoTT has here. Not to mention that knives in the original game were used to free yourself from nets and were only found in certain statues. It's a standard CoD stabbing implement here.\n\nVoice acting isn't just hammy, it's lazy ("Please, don't shoot me.") and it sounds like it was recorded with a computer mic. Your character, meanwhile, spouts off ♥♥♥♥ OH ♥♥♥♥ THAT'S GOTTA HURT ♥♥♥♥ YEAH ♥♥♥♥ THAT HURTS ♥♥♥♥ depending on who you choose at any possible action taken, whether it's picking up a pistol, killing something, or getting shot by something (what exactly is hurting you is unclear until you can make out just what is shooting from the murk).\n\nCompounding the schlocky voice work is gore, which is overwrought to irritation. Blood splatters look flat and they make a point of making sure you just saw a pair of eyeballs hit the screen and slowly slide down as if it were some 6 year-old desperately tugging at your sleeve for you to see the crayon monstrosity he just scrawled in his coloring book. Intense! Environments are basic linear corridors, the classic sign of a mediocre shooter. This issue becomes more apparent when you start running into invisible walls and realize that you're forcibly restricted from backtracking, or when you start bumping into little ledges and things you can't even see, creating a claustrophobia that's completely out of place in the game. Their layout, along with how little white damage value numbers pop out of your enemies when you shoot them, give off the impression that this game was made in some programmer's spare time for a F2P FPS.\n\nWhich I guess isn't all that inaccurate. The game was developed by Interceptor Entertainment, who from what I gather was previously only known for being C&D'd for a Duke Nukem 3D remake. It's yet another entry that attempts to hitch a ride on the Retro Games Return bandwagon conducted by small-name game developers with no idea of what made the original games so great (the original RoTT's gore effects, for example, were more understated and gave it grindhouse charm despite that genre being associated with over-the-top action. Somehow it just doesn't work here). The loading screen factoids that can be found on wikipedia and the achievement "Dat Nostalgia," which rewards you for turning on the 'classic' soundtrack - which is actually just a bad rendering of the original music - provides testimony to this trend. Who's feeling dat nostalgia for a turbid reboot, anyway?\n\nOh, yeah, and enemies can shoot through doors and walls.

I know these developers has a busy life with whatever they are trying to tackle for undisclosed reasons but please they should acknowledge this is going on with people and get back to them whenever they get the chance, not leave them hanging for what may seem forever. If it's not essential or on their high priority like if it was a nuisance, then yes I can deal with that, but when it's a high priority like the game doesn't performance can just spoil the experience then that's a deal breaker right there.

Semi-destructable walls and passable lighting effects definitely make it better than what I originally described as a Doom 2 engine. Really the failings rest in level design and content creation, as well as over-all direction. I'm beginning to suspect that much like the original game, it's only salvation is multiplayer.\n\nI bought this game on pre-order because I'm a sucker for nostalgia. I actually bought a four-pack, cause I used to play the original with my friends in highschool at lan parties (on Pentium 1s, 33mhz woot). I suspect I'm exactly the market they were shooting for, someone who has fond memories of what was always kind of a lame game with ridiculous weapons. Decades later, this reboot is redefining what I consider lame. The enemies almost appear to be sprites instead of polygons, their animations are attrocious, they have a hard time following you from one room to another, and they have a tendency to spring back to life post-mortem from time to time. The pick ups are all over the place, ugly nonsensical tokens, just like the original. Really, so many bad aspects of the original game which were at that time stunted in the name of performance, are now lovingly recreated in the name of nostalgia, making the game seem intentionally terrible. The voice acting makes me cringe, just to think that they asked actual people to lend their voices to this monstrocity. There's a lot of what appear to be inside jokes for the developers, no one else could possibly find them amusing, and that kind of applies to the entire work, this whole game feels like an inside joke that we're all standing outside of. Of the four copies I received, my copy is the only one that's been played for more than minutes. I suppose we should salute our thin skinned developer, so few people have the courage to really push games backwards.\n\nP.S. - You know what people really love? Colored Keys.

The original Rise of the Triad was awesome for its time, I guess if you didnt play it back in the day it may be pretty damn hard to get into nowadays, since the game was pretty complicated for an FPS back then, and although it was revolutionary at its time in some aspects, it was behind the curve in others. I personally enjoyed it a lot but I was there back in the day as well. The remake does get a lot of stuff right in terms of the weapon assortment, visual style, and other things, but the gameplay is literally broken to the point that I am doubtful the developers of this have even played the original Rise of the Triad.\n\nIf you enjoy fast paced arena type shooters like Quake, you might enjoy this. However, I think that type of formula is terrible for a ROTT game, due to the ridiculous speed of the gameplay as well as the weapons. If you wanna play a remake of a classic FPS game, I would go with Shadow Warrior instead. Yes, it costs twice as much, and yes it has no multiplayer, but yes its actually a good game, and this is not. This game serves as an example to why I need to be more cautious before I preorder a game.","November 17, 2013","false","1.3"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","9","21","0","0"

It's not.\n\nI expected a modern shooter with a 90s flavor, like Far Cry Blood Dragon. Nope.\n\nI expected a fun kill everything in-sight and "Hail to the King, Baby" feel. Not even close.\n\nRise of the Triad SUCKS. The level designs are amateurish and frustrating. The AI takes cheap shots at you. The graphics (Is it trying to be ironic?) makes everything really hard to see.\n\nThis is not a tongue-in-cheek blast to the past 90s game with a modern twist. I wanted to like it. I REALLY DO! I ate 90's First-person shooters for breakfast! I'm John Romeo's ♥♥♥♥♥!\n\nYou deserve better, Nostalgic gamers. Go play Doom II again and ignore this mess.","May 2, 2014","false","3.2"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

The framerate stutters and lags, and it's choppy even at 1024x768 with everything turned to the lowest settings. Far prettier games run much, much more smoothly. These performance issues are absolutely unacceptable in a modern PC game.\n\nMaybe in six months, they'll have it nailed down, and this will be worth buying. It isn't even worth the $3 I spent on it at sale price.","December 26, 2013","false","0.4"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"
