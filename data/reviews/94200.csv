It would fit in a huge budget movie brilliantly, gives the game a sense of urgency and scope even though it's just a vertical shooter. Listen to it: http://finalformgames.bandcamp.com/album/jamestown-soundtrack\n\nThen there's graphics. I'm a sucker for good pixel art and Jamestown really delivers in that department. The theme is pretty insane (American colonial wars on Mars) but again, this was a given for games made 20 years ago. I'm really happy there are still devs who writing that kind of silly but fun story nowadays.\n\nGame mechanics are both simple and skill-rewarding. You get a Vaunt meter that fills up when you collect gold from destroyed enemies, and when it's full you can activate the special. You'll get a shield for few seconds and your weapon will turn a different color and do more damage. If you want to sustain this you'll have to keep getting more gold. Larger enemies drop bigger amounts but you can also do combos on some enemies - destroying parts of them in a specific order or hitting them in a particular moment. This adds so much depth to the gameplay.\n\nThere are only five levels in the whole game but each one is meticulously drawn and designed. The devs managed to convert this limitation in their favor. There are six difficulties to choose from and each new level cuts out the easiest one - that way you'll have to play the last level on one of the two hardest difficulties - Divine and Judgement. And believe me - this will test you. It's not as brutal as Japanese shmups but it gets intense. There are also 4 ships to choose from with different weapons and specials (the Gunner being my favorite). The DLC adds 4 more ships. Small number of levels didn't stop the devs from making a big number of shorter, bonus ones. You unlock these with coins you earn after your level evaluation. There's also a gauntlet mode where you play levels in order. Tough as nails but really satisfying.\n\nThere's local co-op and it's done brilliantly. You can fully customize the controls and play 4-person co-op with one gamepad, a mouse and a keyboard. There's even an achievement for completing a level that way. No online though, not a problem for me but some people can see it as a serious flaw.\n\nI simply love this game. Wish more people would play it. It really reminds me of my Amiga days.","November 26, 2013","true","9.0"," 40 of 48 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","40","48","0","0"

A top down bullet hell shooter set in an alternate history timeline (largely mirroring early American history, only this time with aliens), it presents itself with an air of confidence, as if it realizes what a pedigree its of and is determined to make you see so as well.\n\nYou can try to break down what makes Jamestown so great into understandable pieces of a larger whole, but it's the combination of them all that pushes it beyond a decent reimagining of classic shmups, into a modern classic. The feel of the ships is relentlessly precise, the action ferocious and incredibly satisfying, and the presentation presenting a remarkably well realized world (despite how little exposition there is).\n\nThe more you play Jamestown, the more these elements shine, upping the ante at a breakneck pace, forcing you to improve or perish. However, it does so in a way that allows for a natural increase in skill, letting players ease into the challenge instead of pushing them into it right from the start like the games of the genre are so known for. It also creates a continuous stream of rewards for players that manage to improve past the point of entry, with more elaborate enemy designs, tougher boss fights, and some truly grueling challenge levels. And then you have the coop, the glorious coop, the only flaw of which is that it is sadly local only. Should you get a chance to play with some friends though, it's a fantastic experience that scales perfectly and adds even more replay value as you go through levels that now feel new once again.\n\nAt times the action is so intense that it's hard to even keep track of your ship, let alone take in all that Jamestown has to offer, but when you can manage to take a step back it's incredible the level of polish applied to even the smallest areas of the game. I was quite frankly taken aback when I first gave it a try, and this feeling was renewed even up to the very last boss fight, which was as epic and satisfying as I could have hoped for. If you have even the most remote fondness for bullet hell games, Jamestown is about as penultimate an entry point into the genre as you could hope for. Everyone with more than a passing enjoyment of the genre should have played it long ago, but if not, consider this a wake up call that you've been sleeping on something awesome.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","August 3, 2014","true","3.5"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","27","33","0","3"

Supporting up to 4 player local co-op with any combination of mouse, keyboard, and contollers, Jamestown stands out from the crowd.\n\nOn top of the multiplayer focus, Jamestown has a unique setting and great design. The story takes place in an alternate history of the colony of Jamestown on Mars, and that's about all there is to say. The art is great, nothing too special, but the music is fantastic. The epic soundtrack fits the intensity that the game reaches at certain difficulty levels.\n\nThe pacing and progression hold Jamestown together nicely. The in game store allows you to buy new difficulty mode and bonus levels that both offer up some intense challenge. The game slowly makes you incrase the difficulty to reach new levels, which pushes you to practice and push yourself. There is also a joke mode that takes the already outlandish story and makes it even sillier.\n\nHigh scores are the main incentive for replaying. The game offers up a combination of any 4 ships that have their own unique play style, and the combinations  can get pretty insane on-screen. Vaunt mode can be activated after collecting a certain amount of gold and it releases giant shield that can aborsb bullets that will raise your score and save your friends. On top of this, enemies will also offer up bonus points if you hit them at a certain point or time ( I have barely figured out any of these). There are also many difficulty settings that can turn this game into a frantic bullet hell.\n\nThis game is highly recommended with some friends. Even though the local co-op only may be a turn off, this will be a great excuse to see some of your friends in person.\n\n***The DLC offers up 3 great new ships and pilots (Guy Fawkes included), and each of them are different and fantastic.","October 29, 2013","true","17.7"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","0"

The bullet patterns and level designs are solid but also a bit bland and lacking in strategic variety. It's good, but not great.\n\nWhere it really shines is multiplayer, as unlike the tacked on co op of your average Cave game, Jamestown's mechanics and gameplay were finely balanced around co op from the start. It's probably the best co op shmup ever made, and that's definitely something to brag about.\n\nIt also has one of the best and most creative settings and aesthetics for a shmup outside of a Cave game. The theme, music, pixel art, and setting are excellent.\n\nIf you don't have anyone to play with (local multiplayer only), than Jamestown is a decent shmup that should probably be somewhere in the middle of your wishlist compared to some of the other excellent PC shmups out there. However, if you have some friends to play with, it's an absolute must buy.","February 7, 2014","true","6.0"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","1"

It twists the familiar space shooter into a new frontier classic. You don't pilot a spaceship, instead you're in what looks like a futuristic flight chair. Don't get deceived, this chair packs a punch, its got standard lasers, a special beam and shields. Thankfully, you can hold the button down for a stream of lasers. This is a game of fun, challenge and points, not wearing you out.\n\nThe game has more than beautiful visuals, its got gorgeous gameplay mechanics that get explained in the tutorial. You collect gold nuts to fill up a shield meter, then when its full, you can use the shield to briefly block bullets. When that shield goes away, your red projectiles turn purple and you now have 50% higher damage and you get double your score. Aggression gets rewarded, because your meter starts to drain pretty quick unless you get more "gold." This gold also doubles as the in game currency.\n\nWith this currency you can buy many things including three new ships, each with different weapons. Your starter chair's standard beam is a nice wide spread to make things easy and accessible, you'll feel powerful right off the bat. You also have a strong forward beam to rip through enemies. There's a subtlety to it though, you'll go slightly slower and I have no problem with that.\n\nFrom there you can buy a more complex chair that has a fat wave of a forward beam, but instead of having a more powerful weapon, holding the button lets you rotate the angle of the beam. So you can have the beam shoot in 360 degrees all while still having a meager front gun. The third ship has a double front laser, but it has a giant sphere that charges between your power shots. When you launch the projectile it moves slow, but in a way that's good, because that delay gives me time to get away while still avoiding projectiles. The fourth chair is a stream of a single laser, but your power attack detonates every beam. I give them credit for such creativity, but I couldn't find much of a use for it. Its designed to shoot next to the enemy, then detonate it so you get the most damage.\n\nJamestown an accessible game, because the first three levels let you get your feet wet with a normal (easiest) difficulty. Its no pushover though, because to get to the fourth level, you'll need to complete the first three on difficult. Then to get into the fifth, you'll need to complete all four of the previous levels on legendary difficulty. No bullet hail shooter would be complete without two more difficulties above that. To some that may make it a grind having to replay levels, but I'd rather play the same levels twice on a harder difficulty than play the hardest difficulty right off the bat. That just scares people away.\n\nSince you're flying a chair, bullets only kill you when you the pilot get hit. Every death respawns you. Every continue brings up an arcade style countdown and when you run out of continues, you'll need to restart the level. This all makes the game forgiving, friendly and fun. It wants you to play it. It wants you to complete it and most of all it wants you to have fun. It rewards you with the gold you've collected in a level whether you complete it or die. You're always rewarded.\n\nAfter each level, you get dumped back to the game's menu. On this menu you can select any unlocked level, visit the game's shop or bonus challenge levels. I do feel it breaks up the action, but there's a gauntlet mode that lets you play the entire five level game start to finish with limited continues. At the start of the game, you're instantly given enough gold to purchase gauntlet mode. They know how unconventional a sort of hub menu is for a game like this, so they offer the traditional route.\n\nOne thing that I didn't like on all menus was having a mouse pointer. Even using a 360 controller, you still have to use it as a mouse cursor. I suppose this was because there's so much going on the game's main menu with being able to select a locale on the world map to enter a level. While it was precise, I feel it was inefficient.\n\nThe game is obviously a retro 90s style of gorgeous. I can tell the amount of love that got poured into this game with the detail in it. The levels are all completely different, and every enemy is too. You won't find the same enemies level to level, or even reskins. They're all different, with different habits. There's such a wide variety of enemies on a single level, let alone in all five. You've got agile ships, big ships, ground crawlers, wall turrets that shoot out horizontally and so much more. More importantly is these enemies are fun to destroy. They explode and it just feels good to laser through them. I think its one of the core elements needed to make a shoot'em up fun.\n\nThe bosses are massive, almost screen filling with multiple patterns and parts. The parts are even marked on the meters at the top of the screen. You'll know this boss has three or five segments. They get more difficult with each stage. These bosses turn the game into a pattern based bullet hail. Windmills of bullets, different patterns, they all fill the screen, but the game is so pixel perfect you can dodge them without exact precision. Every boss is different, some you need to disable sections or pods. Others you'll need to damage their projectiles to even hurt them. When they open up to a moment of vulnerability, its on then. Just power blast your way into them and its just so satisfying to destroy a boss with screen filling explosions.\n\nDestroying a section of the boss or even big enemies destroy their projectiles. So there's a risk reward. Stay there with a bullet coming at you knowing you can blast off that segment or do you dodge? Its a good risk and reward there.\n\nThe fifth level changes the mold of each level. There are moving walls that make things difficult. Luckily the walls don't hurt you unless they have spikes or they crush you. It was a nice touch that kept it interesting at the end.\n\nAfter each level, you're greeted with a breakdown of your score along with your rank. You also get to see the story to progress, and while I can say that the artwork is beautiful for the story, I didn't find myself reading any of it. It can be Shakespeare, but I just wanted to get back to the action. You can skip the story or even buy a lighthearted story from the shoppe.\n\nI can't forget the music though, its grandiose in a 90s era sort of way. Its another fantastic thing that stands up about the game. No offense to Jamestown, but it was from a game like Final Fantasy from the 90s, people would herald it as one of the best soundtracks. There's a variety of feels to each song, everything from a frontier wild west sort of fun song, to things that would sound at home in a Predator of Aliens game from the 90s.\n\nFor those that like a challenge, there are five levels of difficulty and a hardcore mode without auto-respawn that you can buy from the store. There are more than a dozen challenging bonus maps. Everything from survive X amount seconds to score Y amount of points in X seconds. While I can survive the most crazy bullet bomb explosions, I'm not good enough to score big points. You've also got leader boards to keep you in game.\n\nIf you're a bullet hail or shooter fan this is a must own. The 90s style and fun combat make it entertaining for multiple play throughs. Well worth $10 for the 2 hours.","March 24, 2015","true","2.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","2"

With Jamestown you'll naturally learn various techniques that can transfer over to nearly any "bullet hell" kind of game, such as understanding your player character's tiny hitbox (if things hit this, you die!), grazing through tight openings in bullet patterns, and "streaming" various aimed attacks that come at you from one side of the screen to the other, with bullets narrowly missing you.\n\nKey to mastering the game is understanding the "vaunt" system. Vaunting requires only a full vaunt gauge to activate and a single button press. Vaunting affords you some momentary invincibility both upon activation and deactivation, but also serves to double the points you receive from destroying enemies and picking up collectibles as well as doubling the damage you do. It's an ingenius system that can be used for newbies as a way to nullify tricky to dodge patterns and for more advanced players to milk the scoring system for all its worth. In that way, you can almost literally play Jamestown any way you want, be it for survival or gunning for high score challenges.\n\nThough the game is relatively short (five stages total), there's still a really great amount of content to be explored. While playing, you'll unlock four types of ships, challenge maps that will further enhance your understanding of how shmups work, and a whole slew of difficulty modes that are all geared toward creating a smooth level of challenge as you keep moving up and getting better. So, even if the "main game" is a tad on the short side, the game's still feature rich enough to warrant the pricetag.\n\nJamestown is not only a dandy little shmup itself, but it's also a very comprehensive learning tool that can help new players to the genre come to grips and get over the intimidation factor. The myriad of difficulty selections and stage designs all feel constructed around the idea of getting better as you play. The more you put into Jamestown, the more you'll get out of it. It may be a tad too tame for experienced shmup players, but new players definitely can not go wrong here.","August 19, 2014","true","4.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

Some will have homing missiles, others will have plasma beams, and all sorts of other special abilities. As far as mechanics is concerned it's pretty simple. You have your regular shoot button, then a special which you can charge for an alternate fire, you also have vault as a defensive skill to negate any immediate dangers and bullets, and that's about it! Shoot stuff, collect the coins, then buy stuff with the coins. It's not a hard game to get into but it is a hard one to master.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H60SgEszlww\nThe game's pacing is great as well. Each level never over stay it's welcome, while offering varied difficulty challenges as you proceed through them. This is a good thing since you'll be going over the same levels more than once in order to unlock everything in the game. It is arguable that Jamestown recycles a lot of the same content, but the developers have introduced interesting ways to reuse older assets to further the variety the game has to offer. From arcade mode, to challenge modes, and even a gauntlet mode, and more to unlock later on.\n\nThe game's graphics and presentation is top-notch. The pixel art featured is of a high caliber, with great details and animation. The game's soundtrack compliments the game's excellent presentation and really hits home the atmosphere the game tries to get across. It's just a gorgeous looking and sounding game.\n\nThere's a lot to love about Jamestown, but it's not perfect. The biggest issue I drew from the game is it's white enemy bullets. Of all the colors in the color wheel, why on earth did the developers choose white as the color of what's arguably the most important element in a shmup? White blends into the background, it blends in when there are explosions, it blends in where the screen shake. White is just not the color the eye picks up on first. When you're talking about shmups, visual clarity is of the utmost importance. Shmup players don't watch their spirits or the bullets individually, they "feel" them like a 6th scent. Usually in other shmups enemy bullets are as clear as day, allowing the player to ultaize their peripheral vision to "feel" their way around the battlefield. Because the bullets are white, a dull, uncaptivating color, the player is forced to watch every single bullet while keeping a close eye on the character sprite, forcing the player to play with a focus on parts of the game that shouldn't be focused on. The focus should be on the on coming dangers, not the immediate danger. The white bullets is my only real complaint about Jamestown, but it is a major one considering the genre.\n\nOverall Jamestown is an excellent shmup. It feels great, it has a great degree of variety, and the ships are very interestingly designed. It does suffer from visual clarity problems due to it's white enemy bullets, but if you can adjust, I have no doubt Jamestown will be a memorable experience.\n\nPros:\n- Fantastic pixel art\n- Fantastic Soundtrack\n- Great diversity in ships\n- Lots to unlock\n- Many different ways to play\n\nCons:\n- White enemy bullets... for a shmup... seriously what the hell were the devs thinking?\n(Only one con, but this one is a biggie)\n\nHours of Jamestown played: 2.5\n\nCompletion Status on Jamestown: N/A\n\nThis copy of  Jamestown was purchased","December 25, 2015","true","2.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/recommended/94200/","geoluz","GeoLuz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/","180 products in account","Jamestown is well known to many Americans as the first colonial settlement in North America in 1619. This game is also set in the year 1619, but it is not in the New World. It is set in Mars. You are a British colonial on the run from the king and country and you try to uncover the secrets of the colony of Roanoke. However, the opposing forces you must face are the Spanish/Martians. This is a top-down shooter that would remind shooters fans of top-down shooters from the 1980s.\n\nIt feels like the plot takes a backseat to the solid gameplay. The game introduces you to the beam ship, a standard ship with a primary mode and a secondary mode that requires you to use the left mouse and right mouse, respectively. Other ships are locked until you complete some campaign missions, but you will still have to use the left and right mouse buttons. The controls are that simple, but the game will always test your skills to the max. The beam ship’s primary mode is the 2 lines of bullets and the secondary mode is the powerful beam that can destroy lesser enemies with ease and is very useful against larger enemies. Other ships that are unlocked have their own primary and secondary modes and are good for testing in the campaign missions and challenge stages. The DLCs have more ships that can be unlocked and are definitely worth trying out while testing your skills.\n\nAll ships unlocked in the game have one thing in common: a vaunt meter. You must fill up this vaunt meter by collecting the golden nuts and bolts that defeated enemies drop. Once you activate that vaunt by using your default middle mouse button, there is a circular shield that appears around your ship. At first glance, the vaunt looks like it is useful for defensive strategies and is a life saver. I later realized that the vaunt begins a point multiplier that builds up as you defeat enemies while the vaunt is active.  You can defeat many enemies in a very short time, but the vaunt also lasts for a short time. The vaunt is best activated when you are in a tight situation, such as when many enemies are firing so many bullets it would be hard to get through them without being blown up.\n\nJames town challenges your shooting and movement skills enough that you would have to visit your shoppe to buy some items with the currency you have earned during the campaign missions. The currency comes from collecting the golden nuts and bolts from the defeated enemies. You can buy new ships and challenge packs with your hard earned currency. The challenge stages are break from the campaign missions, but they truly put your skills to the test and train you for other challenge stages and campaign missions.\n\nThe challenge stages require you to reach specific goals such as scoring X number of points in X number of seconds. In one challenge stage you must destroy train cars to score an extraordinary number of points to complete the stage. The trick is to destroy train cars, but destroying the engine car last is the key to scoring so many points. I think this is a smart learning curve put together by the indie developers of this game. The difficulties are not unfair because the game is not over that quickly. Jamestown gives you a few credits from the beginning of the mission or challenge stage and those credits can be enough to win at the end.\n\nAn interesting take on the learning curve of Jamestown is how you unlock future campaign missions. In order to unlock future campaign mission you have to complete each of the other previous missions on the next highest difficulty level. Every campaign mission begins with ordinary enemies and some larger enemies. When you reach the last stage there is a boss to defeat. It is important to lose as few lives as possible in order to defeat the boss since it is easy to lose multiple credits. There are lots of close calls throughout the game and your ship explodes when it is hit in its dead center. The vaunt becomes critical in these close calls, but you have to be sure that the vaunt is available when the situation is right.\n\nJamestown has local co-op of up to four players. It is surprising to me that there is no multiplayer since the game would have made for some interesting competition. There are leaderboards to show you how you stack up against other players from around the world.\n\nThe graphics are pixelated, but the pixelation is very impressive and detailed. All the explosions and action look very nice and you clearly see the well detailed stripes on the uniforms of the enemies who represent the Spanish/Martian forces.\n\nEssentially, the graphics provide enough style and the gameplay of Jamestown provides enough substance to warrant buying this game at an affordable price of $9.99.

The game has four ships each with its own unique attack style. The levels are played asynchronously. In addition to the storyline there are a number of challenge modes which can be completed.\n\nIn 1619 Raleigh has escaped execution at the hands of his own king. Desiring to clear his name Raleigh flees the Tower of London and heads to the new world, Mars. Mars is currently being fought over between the English and the Spanish armada. Unfortunately for Raleigh the Martians are loyal to the Spanish and have sided with them. Resting his hopes for clearing his name on solving the mystery of the vanished settlement at Roanoake, Raleigh heads to the Jamestown colony in search of John Smith.\n\nJamestown is the first alternate history/sci-fi shooter I have ever played and indeed it may be the only one that exists. Storyline is not something I have payed mind to in other shoot'em ups, but it is very present in Jamestown. Before and after every level you get a story update. Happily these can be easily be skipped and even turned off entirely. I don't mind the story, but it's not why I'm playing a shoot'em up.\n\nJamestown has everything you would expect in a shooter. Destructible enemies to kill, indestructible objects to avoid, bonus items to grab. But the details differentiate it. Before each stage you select a type of ship. At the beginning your options will be limited but as you play the other ships will unlock. You can plays with the Beam, Gunner, Charge or Bomber. Beam and Charge are both listed as standard while Gunner and Bomber are listed as advanced. And I certainly agree with the assessment. The two advanced ships are much more difficult to use effectively.\n\nEach ship has two attack modes. The Beam gives you a wide radius of fire and is the only ship to natively firing range outside of what is directly in front of you. The special weapon here is a high-powered constant beam which fires directly in front of you and rapidly damages opposing ships. The drawback is that your ship moves quite slowly while firing this special attack. The other standard ship is the Charge. The basic weapon is has a smaller firing dispersal and fires fewer bullets than the Beam's basic weapon. The Charge special shot fires a slow moving ball that damages any enemy in its path. It doesn't stop when it contacts an enemy, but rather continues on damaging anything in the path. It slowly charges over time, so that if you wait to use it the ball will be larger and more destructive.\n\nThe first advanced ship you will unlock is the Gunner. This ship has a basic weapon very similar to the Charge ship and is unique in that the special weapon is always active. Using the special weapon allows you to change the direction in which the special weapon fires. Thus if you press left while using the special weapon it will fire left. When you let up on the special weapon the direction of fire will lock in place until you use it again. This weapon certainly takes some getting used to, but it is the only weapon that allows you to fire to the left, right or towards the rear of your ship. The Bomber has the weakest basic weapon, a single stream of bullets. But the using the special causes the bullets to explode doing tremendous damage.\n\nWhen you destroy an enemy, it explodes into a field of golden gears and cogs. Collecting these not only increases your score but also moves increases the Vaunt\nmeter. Once activated Vaunt has several effects. For a short time it provides a shield around your ship. For a longer but still limited time you will double your score. Collecting gears and cogs during the Vaunt will increase the time your score increases. Vaunt also increases the damage your ships weaponry does to enemy units. The final feature of Vaunt mode is that if you press vaunt again while it is active  you will get a shorter lasting shield, but Vaunt mode immediately ends if you utilize this.\n\nJamestown ostensibly has five difficulty levels ranging from Normal to Judgement. But make no mistake the first two: Normal and Difficult do not allow you to play the full game. If you play on Normal you can only access the first three levels of the game. You will then be forced to play the earlier levels on a higher difficulty to continue the main story mode. If you should choose to use the Difficult setting you can access the fourth but not the fifth level of the game. This was frustrating to me as a player. I recommend using Legendary (or higher) difficulty from the beginning.\n\nJamestown offers a number of additional gameplay options beyond the main story mode. There is the Gauntlet mode where you play through all the levels consecutively. You are given three lives per credit and three credits. The credits do not reset during gameplay. Gauntlet is unique in Jamestown in that it is the only mode where your accomplishments in one level have any bearing on the next.\n\nThere are also a number of Bonus Levels that can be unlocked. These must be unlocked to access them through a mixture of spending ducats and doing well on the challenges which you already have access to. Most of the conditions for completing the bonus levels are earning certain number of points and activating rings by flying over them, in others you simply have to survive a set amount of time.\n\nJamestown offers four player simultaneous play. However it is local only. The ships are clearly designed to work well together so that one player can ameliorate the weaknesses of the ship of another, or can activate a vaunt shield to protect a friend. It is unfortunate that online multiplayer was not offered.\n\nJamestown also offers for additional purchase a DLC pack which has more ships to choose from and bonus levels.\n\nI really like the look of Jamestown which is a throwback to the 16 bit era with pixelization and attractive sprites. The soundtrack is also quite good. Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like it, Jamestown never captured my interest as much as I was hoping. I think that is largely to do with the fact that the game appears to be primarily designed for multiplayer co-op. If I could play online multiplayer I have a feeling my appreciation for Jamestown would increase tremendously. The other aspect that detracts for me is that each level is its own unique challenge and that your performance in one does not carry over to the next. I tend to most enjoy shoot'em ups where you can continually upgrade your weapons until you can destroy most anything on the screen without trying too hard. And then I can get a bunch of free guys so that by the time the game is challenging enough that I die even with my tremendous fire power and start again with a basic ship I have enough lives that I can brute force my way to the finish. Can't do that in Jamestown. The only way to upgrade your destructive capability is with Vaunt and choosing a more destructive ship, and you can't get any free lives. My guess is that Jamestown is a lot more fun to play multiplayer. But I think it is unlikely that I will ever get a chance to try.","July 3, 2014","true","6.4"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

There you get involved with Captain John Smith, Virginia Dare, Martians and the search for the lost colony of Roanoke.\n\nBut this is really a retro style bullet hell shoot'em up. You destroy swarms of alien ships while dancing between the bullets. You can unlock different ships with different types of weapons, Challenge Levels and other game modes. There are five levels to the game, But to unlock the later levels you have to complete the previous ones at higher difficulty settings. You get nine lives for each level, So the game is pretty forgiving in that sense.\n\nOn my play through I started at the easiest difficulty setting and had to replay the earlier levels at higher settings. I really didn't mind since it only took me a couple of hours to get to the last level. But the last level took me just as long, If not a little longer, to beat than the rest of the game. I only completed one of the challenge levels and only dabbled a little with gauntlet mode.\n\nI never been big on bullet hell games, but this game is OK. The game looks good and plays good. But there is just too much selecting stuff from menus. It gives the game a disjointed feel rather than a journey. Integrating that stuff into the game would have helped maintain continuity between the levels and taken the player out of the game less often. Basic gameplay is fine.  Though, Maybe I'm just relatively inexperienced in the genre, At times things seemed more like a matter of luck than skill. Having 3 lives and 3 continues (another thing to pull the player out) per level definitely helped me get through the game. This is an Indie game so the music is, as expected, excellent. Not really a big part of the game is the whole colonial Mars story. Which is fine as it's just something to connect the levels and not very interesting otherwise.\n\nIn a way this seems more like a taster than a complete game. Aficionados may enjoy it and it is friendly to beginners. But the overall experience could have been better.\n\nEdit - A marginal thumbs up.","August 3, 2014","true","6.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The flow of the game is fast, challenging  and very pleasing to the eye and ear.  It is also , like many retro games, a designed as a 4 player co-op. Overall , This is a very well put game .\n\nThere is nothing hard to understand about Jamestown, it is also pretty easy to play(although I am refering to picking it up and getting used to it, not difficulty)\n\nI have 2 small qualms with Jamestown.  Although the Devs probably wanted you to work hard to complete it ( and my god, I certainly did )  it seems silly that the last  levels are locked, where you have to play levels 1-3 on Legendary difficulty first, which is pretty hard, I guess in most other games I would expect to play the game beginning to end on hard or normal difficulty, not grind away on the harder difficulties before I get that option.  And well the end level is pretty friggin hard too, I spent 4 hpours trying to beat it as it has an intense and really hard to keep track of enviroment which is very celverly laid out, as  well as the boss..,.   In saying that I do kind of get a kick out of getting something for my sweat, so the design option may not be so bad...\n\nThe next thing is that though this is a retro style top scrolling shooter, on the last level inparticular, I was experiencing some slow down... True enough, there was ALOT happening all at once, however, for such a 'simple ' game, I would expect it to run well on my Dual core which runs most other games farily well.\n\nI did find the very bar bones application of the story quite puzzling, it was good though, particualrly since the whole lay out of the game kind of pushes it.  Also this style is very intesteing too, a sort of steampunk/New world (or what ever it is...,)  style pretty cool.\n\nAfter completting it today, I have bought the Dlc, and would consider it well worth it, its good fun and if you are like me and like challenges, then try completeing it...  Excellent Game\n","June 20, 2015","true","9.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Makes great support of local coop for up to four players, if you have the devices for such. It also has a strong sense of accomplishment, presenting what looks like an impossible challenge but making all the threats very clear and obvious. Despite its status as a bullet hell shooter, the visual design is very clean and smooth, keeping things from getting too washed out and unclear. Only on the rare occasion do you feel like you were hit by something you couldn't possibly have seen, instead usually feeling like you screwed up and can do better.

You could make an argument, that it does not have that many levels and if played on lower difficulties it can be blasted through in 30 minutes or so. However, in its essence, Jamestown is like old arcade shooters, they were never long but their difficulty and the fact that they created a strong competetive scene, were the highlights of this kind of games. On top of scalable difficulty, game offers additional challenges in form of short survival modes, boss battles, going through campagins in gauntlet mode etc. Hard to get bored.\nLast but not least, the esthetics of the game is really interesting, it blends nicely, this old school feeling and still it manages to look modern enough and not too pixelated (see screenshots/video on the store front).\nI am sure that there are games waaaay hardcore in ths genre than Jamestown, but with this one I found myself playing over and over just to get slightly better score and advance through leaderboards.\nGive it a shot.","March 6, 2015","true","16.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

With its Simple yet functional menus, new players who own an XIN input controller/Xbox One controller can navigate them via an on screen cursor.\n\nJames Town features a small yet lengthy number of levels with various challenging difficulties that not only increase the tension but often require repetition to master each of the levels enemy types and end bosses. The action is easy to pick up and hard to master, knowing when to use defensive/offensive special abilities adds another layer of depth to the experience not always utilized across the genre.\n\nAn ingame currency keeps the experience on a positive path, players are rewarded for higher difficulty mission completions, in-game cash is used to purchase new missions, some on previous levels with special modifiers or objectives adding to the replayability factor.\n\nThe downloadable add-on offered for this game features a small subset of extra weaponry but i would argue that it is purely optional as most players will find progression through the game using the stock offerings is more than sufficient, the games soundtrack is also enjoyable with epic boss battle music.\nGraphics are easy on the eyes with cool explosion effects and well detailed backgrounds. Weapon animations are also a major highlight here also.\n\nA fantastic shooter with great artwork and pixel graphics, an overall satisfying package. 10/10","November 9, 2015","true","4.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hyperduel/recommended/94200/","hyperduel","Hyperduel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hyperduel/","1983 products in account","Product received for free\n\nI must admit that when I had the opportunity to review Jamestown, a title developed & published by Final Form Games, I immediately jumped at the chance - being the avid shmup fanatic that I am. And let's face it, within the Steam universe there certainly exists no shortage of mediocre ones to play...those that tried to emulate the heart & soul of arcade shooters but which ultimately lacked that certain magic and polish to them. However I always heard very glowing accolades about this particular title, but are they warranted? Let's find out below.\n\nThe game touts itself as having "lovingly handcrafted pixels", and it is my pleasure to report that these retro-styled 2D graphics are absolutely superb, easily evoking the look & feel of its 1990's era arcade brethren with its charming yet familiar style...making me quickly feel right at home. And I must also say that it's a very colorful game as well, sporting vibrantly rich hues and pretty bullet patterns which instantly dazzle the senses.\n\nThe artwork itself is themed from a "17th-century British Colonial Mars" motif, and it seems to work quite well, especially since it also includes a matching storyline to add a bit more distinction to this title. The story itself is wholly superfluous to be sure, because with a shmup we all know gameplay is truly the cornerstone of the experience, but I found it to be a nice touch nonetheless and there is a decent amount of skippable text which can be read by those seeking to capture the full essence of Jamestown.\n\nAs far as its music & audio go, it was superb all around...with punchy bullet & explosion sounds overlayed atop beautiful orchestral arrangments which seemed to perfectly fit in with the theme of this memorable game.\n\nNow getting back to its gameplay here, this is a dreamy kind of bullet hell indeed in that it's very challenging yet always fair. And the wonderful part about it is that you have both primary and secondary weapons which can be alternated seamlessly throughout each level, as well as a tertiary "Vaunt Meter" which is a time-limited power-up/shield combo whereby you first have to collect gold from destroyed enemies to recharge before using again (you simply move toward the falling gold and it scoops up automatically within your proximity).\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, what truly impressed me most about it by far, is the ability to play both online and local co-op with up to four players. This adds a very interesting dynamic to the game since the way it is uniquely implemented consists of only one player needing to survive the level in order for the entire team to succeed, whereby everyone respawns once more to continue off playing the next successive one. And I must confess that with so many bullets flying in Jamestown, having the ability to lean on your team-mates in this way is a definite plus. Because death can come surprisingly fast and unexpectedly when playing on any of the several difficulties higher than normal - just massage one single bullet the wrong way and you're a goner to be sure! Which in the end makes it all the more addictive and challenging, undoubtedly infusing a lot more replay value into it.\n\nBut nonetheless I do have to admit that I was somewhat disappointed by how few levels there were to enjoy (only 5). It's just so much exhilarating fun to experience, that I very soon wanted more Jamestown to play...perhaps twice as much. In fact easily twice as much. And while there is a DLC available which adds in more ships, I somehow felt that the base game just wasn't quite meaty enough for my taste...but then again at its price-point I suppose this can be somewhat understandable...but still...I did decidedly expect a decent amount more content in this regard.\n\nVerdict\nHaving said that, you will be absolutely spoiled in no time after playing this gem...make no mistake about it. It hits all the high notes with ease as far as its frenetically fun gameplay & presentation goes. And it certainly plays very well with no discernable issues noticed. I suppose I will have no choice now but to pick up the DLC for it, because while immersing myself within this one, it felt just like I was being transported back inside the 1990's arcades...with those unforgettable chains of explosive delight ricocheting between my ears...and eventually soon finding their way to a soft spot inside my heart.\n\nThis shoot'em'up masterpiece receives a 4.5 out of 5 stars from me.\n\nPros:\n- Exceptionally satisfying gameplay with responsive controls\n- Includes a somewhat interesting and novel story\n- Co-op and local co-op (up to 4 players)\n- Remappable controls and full controller support\n- Unlockable ships/weapons (along with a shop)\n- Unlockable bonus levels\n- Pleasing & colorful retro-styled aesthetics\n- Game screen can be optionally stretched to cover the entire area of your monitor\n- Steam achievements (30+)\n- Online leaderboards\n\nCons:\n- Far too few levels in the game, the most glaring drawback with it\n\n\nFor similar reviews and great giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com","May 29","true","0.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

It has 5 difficulty options and 5 stages. The stages are designed nicely and the bosses are also. Everything looks great and the stages have a lot of details put into them.\n\nThe game has a shop system where you can buy ships and challenge levels. The 4 ships you can pick from are all unique. No 2 ships play similar to each other. The challenge stages will also last you a long time. They are difficult objectives to complete in a short section of a stage and there are around 20 of them. You also can't beat the game on Normal difficulty. You need to raise it higher to play the last 2 stages. Leaderboards are included, so you can challenge your friends to the highest scores in the game.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about the game, is that there are no upgrades. I always enjoyed upgrading my firepower while playing a shmup, but there is none of that in this game. Jamestown can be completed in around 30 minutes like most shmups, but it has the depth to be played for a lot longer.","April 12, 2014","true","5.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Even though me and my wife had to try the final stage over like 30 times, we never really felt frustrated because the game isn't too punishing and the fact that you're playing together definitely just makes things more enjoyable. I highly recommend this unless you don't like this kind of game, and it plays great if you have an arcade stick/fightstick and maps really easily.

That’s kind of cool.\n\nGameplay-wise the most notable thing is that it’s a widescreen, but scrolls vertically. I’m not used to that, as it means a lot of bullets come from the sides, as opposed to games like Touhou and Dodonpachi, but it's nice that the majority of the screen isn't wasted. There’s also a pretty big variety of ships, with very different play styles.

It's probably one of the best co-op shmups out there. However it's not a good single player experience.\n\nThe game is pretty much reliant on memorization ala psikyo games, except it's 100x more annoying because the bullets don't spawn corresponding to the location of the enemies and the ships are rather slow. Enemies can also shoot you off screen because of this annoying quirk. The scoring system is pretty shallow too, collect coins and vaunt your way through the stage, it's not super fun. The ships are simply useless in single player.\n\nThe challenge levels are fun, there's that I suppose.

The problem I faced with it was that it doesn't ramp up the difficulty until you go to at least "Legendary".\n\nStill a good challenge and a fun story to keep you entertained. The game story itself is not long but there are extra challenge rooms to keep testing your skills. I was playing with a 360 controller and did find the controls to be a little touchy and not as precise as you would hope for. Also if an added Online MP was added as an expansion or in a sequel I could see it being a ton of fun.\n\n3/5\n1.5 Hours To Complete","January 13, 2014","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sometimes when I am playing I feel this is a bit like ikaruga - but not quite as brutal. To get the most enjoyment ouf this game you need three or four friends for some local COOP. Jamestown will work with any USB controllers you have lying around and does the button configurations in the most slick way I've seen yet; it makes setup super easy. The primary complaint is that the difficulty does a very poor job of scaling to the number of people playing. On any of the harder difficulties one player is impossible, two is OK, three is easier, and four is MUCH easier - for this reason I only play when I have exactly four people visiting. Despite this the graphics are great and the interface is seamless.

The excellent input customization is really crazy compared to other games coming out lately. The game just works right out of the box, period, no matter what input you have or what problems you're used to.\n\nThe music is beyond excellent and the graphics are superb, the entire game has a nostalgic quality that comes from successful emulation of older japanese-made arcade shooters from the 80's and 90's. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to everyone, you merely need to enjoy old-school shooters to get the full effect of and appreciation for the game itself.  It's quite forgiving at low difficulty, and higher difficulties stay challenging even after a few playthroughs. The highest difficulty levels are pretty rough for me, and I have a penchant for the whole bullet-hell genre. My only 'complaint' is the game is rough on my thumbs!\n\nDead serious, the game is worth every penny, even if you don't play it long.","October 5, 2012","true","10.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So much thought was put into how everything works. For the multi-player (local only, but that's ok) you can use pretty much any control setup you like. If you want to stick four separate mice on your computer and hand each one to a different person, the game has no problem with that. Or four keyboards, or gamepads, or any combination. I tried it with a keyboard, a trackball, a mouse, and a gamepad all at once, and Jamestown didn't mind one bit, it just worked.\n\nThe pixel art is excellent, and you have control over exactly how you want that to scale. The music is very good. The story is unique and interesting, crammed full of proper historical references stuffed into the alternate what-if timeline of 17th century colonial Mars. There appears to be a massive number of bonus levels, challenge levels, and multiple ships (and weapon systems) to choose from.\n\nIt's fun.","June 8, 2011","true","2.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/swagdi/recommended/94200/","swagdi","Teeth Like God's Shoeshine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/swagdi/","695 products in account","I got this game for a cent in a Humble Bundle, but it is easily worth full price.\n\nThis game is a "bullet hell" style shoot 'em up set in a creative futuristic steampunk timeline where the British Empire have colonized Mars. It's relatively simple, with only three actions (fire, special, and 'vaunt', which defends you from enemy bullets for a temporary period) but provides tons of depth and difficulty. There are five campaigns and a subset of ships for you to choose your own personal play styles with. While five maps may seem very short, the five difficulty modes will keep you coming back for more; the more chaotic the action, the more fun the game really is. Add many secrets and ship types to unlock and you have a decently fleshed out game.\n\nOne of the game's strong points is presentation. The pixel art is absolutely gorgeous. We're in an era where every single indie developer can churn out poorly made pixel art in an attempt to be "retro", and it's seem like we've forgotten how good pixel art can be. The only downside is that it make the action seem confusing, with enemy bullets sometimes being indistinguishable from the background. But in addition, you have the soundtrack, which is one of the greatest video game soundtracks I have ever heard for a game of this caliber. It pumps you up for the action and contrasts nicely to the crunchy explosions you'll hear.\n\nThe best thing about this game, however, is the local co-op. Supporting up to four players, the game can be played with a mouse, keyboard or controller, and is absolute tons of fun. In co-op play, greater strategy is required through the use of collecting one-ups, but in exchange it allows for greater firepower in the hectic stages. Combine this with a high difficulty and you have some of the most fun you'll ever experience in a shoot em up game, ever. I strongly recommend this for fans of shoot 'em games, especially bullet hell shooters such as Touhou, but everybody needs to give this game a try.","December 24, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The excellent input customization is really crazy compared to other games coming out lately. The game just works right out of the box, period, no matter what input you have or what problems you're used to.\n\nThe music is beyond excellent and the graphics are superb, the entire game has a nostalgic quality that comes from successful emulation of older japanese-made arcade shooters from the 80's and 90's. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to everyone, you merely need to enjoy old-school shooters to get the full effect of and appreciation for the game itself.  It's quite forgiving at low difficulty, and higher difficulties stay challenging even after a few playthroughs. The highest difficulty levels are pretty rough for me, and I have a penchant for the whole bullet-hell genre.

If you get tired of the the primary 5 levels, there are quite a few challenge levels to keep you busy. If you are interested in this type of game at all, it's definitely worth picking up. I got it in a bundle for $1 and it's definitely one of the best dollars I've spent.","September 4, 2014","true","8.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So much thought was put into how everything works. For the multi-player (local only, but that's ok) you can use pretty much any control setup you like. If you want to stick four separate mice on your computer and hand each one to a different person, the game has no problem with that. Or four keyboards, or gamepads, or any combination. I tried it with a keyboard, a trackball, a mouse, and a gamepad all at once, and Jamestown didn't mind one bit, it just worked.\n\nThe pixel art is excellent, and you have control over exactly how you want that to scale. The music is very good. The story is unique and interesting, crammed full of proper historical references stuffed into the alternate what-if timeline of 17th century colonial Mars. There appears to be a massive number of bonus levels, challenge levels, and multiple ships (and weapon systems) to choose from.\n\nIt's fun.","June 8, 2011","true","2.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But hey, people don't play games like this because they're easy.\n\nIt's fast, its frantic, it's pure bullet hell at some of the higher difficulties.

It has a cool score multiplier mechanic and there are ships to ulock and buy. I really enjoy the story as well. Which is told from the first person perspective, with text and picture art. The actual writing is very thoughtful and well done.\n\nThe only negative I could point to is, your progression through the story is stopped after the third level. Until, you play those levels again on a higher difficulty. This feature repeats itself several times. For some, this may be a plus. For those who prefer to play their games on normal it may be an issue.

There are six stages total which you can choose to play individually or nonstop via the "Gauntlet" mode.\n\nThe game has two claim-to-fame mechanics, one of which is the Vaunt system, which charges by picking up enemy drops and provides a small bullet-erasing shield (the "bomb"), as well as increasing your shot power and score multiplier for the duration of the Vaunt.\nThe second unique feature is support for up to not two, but FOUR players via local co-op that can use any combination of mice, keyboards, and gamepads.

The shooting generally feels really light and unsatisfying with anemic sound effects, and the three extra ships you can buy are less fun to use than the one you start with. Moreover, the game as of Jan. 2016 is bugged, with all enemy projectiles displayed as grey, which makes the game needlessly hard-- you can fix it by opting in to the Beta version, but who knows what you're missing out on there.\n\nThe music and the setting are unique and carefully done, but TOO carefully done i think-- i'd rather play a game where the game makers' time was all spent on rock-solid mechanics at the expense of the story than the opposite, and this is the opposite in my own opinion. You really need to have your ducks in a row to spend that much time developing the stylistic elements, but it's not a good enough shooter to get away with it so the whole martian-colonialism thing just ends up being distracting/pointless as you die for the 3000th time to a bullet you couldn't see coming (for a shooter that gets it right see 'Sine Mora', which gets away with its elaborate narrative elements in spades, though admittedly the Arcade mode is pointlessly difficult and rage-inducing).\n\nSo yeah, as a non-superfan of the genre, i really didn't enjoy this-- it's too bugged and hard and viscerally lacking. I'd dock it further points for having an Infuriatingly Annoying Indoor Level, but then pretty much every shooter has one of those...","January 11","false","1.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

It's a bullet hell shoot em up that is relatively easy to start, giving you a way to soak up lots of damage and increase your weapons without taking a hit, and it has several different types of ships and weapons for different play styles.  This game's graphics are just gorgeous, from the wonderfully alien martians and monstrous enemies you fight in search of roanoke, to the steam punk ships and bosses.  It's a beautiful amalgam of sprites and pixel art.  What surprised me most is the sound track, honestly.  It's soul stirring in places, particularly the final boss.  I was getting a Final Fantasy 7, Sephiroth vibe of it.  And the difficulty sliders make the game more akin to a true bullet hell the harder you go, so there's something here for all ages, especially with the challenge maps.  Frustratingly, the game only gives you a set number of lives in single player...I wish they gave you one ups based on your score.  That would have made this game perfect.  Otherwise, this is a super fun shmup that anyone can get into.","April 6, 2014","true","7.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Jamestown is... fine. It's a bullet-hell shmup. If you like that kind of thing and want to be a perfectionist at it, then Jamestown gives you the venue. The story is unusual - a colonial era story but for some reason set on Mars instead of the American colonies, but with all the heroes and villains of the colonial era.

I got it as part of a bundle and ignored it for the better part of a year.\n\nI am a long time SHMUP fan. Donpachi, Dodonpachi and Saidaioujou, Ikaruga, Radiant Silvergun, Giga Wing, Mars Matrix, Fantasy Zone 1 and 2... You name it!\n\nThis game is extremely similar in gameplay mechanics to the Donpachi franchise (down to the available choices of ship/bullet pattern, and even the introduction of a Hyper mode mechanic like in Saidaioujou). It has a wider aspect ratio than most vertical SHMUPs I have played, but it still does not reach 16:9 aspect.\n\nThe bullet patterns are great, the pixelated art style is fantastic, the controls are absolutely responsive and there is four player local co-op.\n\nWhile never reaching the level of greatness of a classic like Dodonpachi, this is nevertheless a game you should try if you are a shmup fan, or even if you are just getting into shmups as this is on the "bearable difficulty" side. It gives you 2 credits (with a couple lives each) in every single stage, and the bomb mechanic (which allows you to escape bullets in a pinch) is easily rechargeable and can be used frequently.\n\nIf I had to say anything negative about this game, it would certainly be that the music, while not bad, is pretty much background noise. Not as memorable as Dodonpachi's, Fantasy Zone's or Ikaruga's fantastic, classic tracks.\n\nNew to SHMUPs or a veteran to the genre, try this game. If it doesn't enthrall you (and it might), you will at the very least not leave disappointed.","August 3, 2014","true","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In the end, it winds up feeling more like something out of Edgar Rice Burroughs' century-old Barsoom novels than anything else. That hardly matters though, as the story is just a quirky backdrop for a whole lot of solid bullet hell shoot 'em up gameplay. It's fairly merciful compared to everything else in the genre (at least until you attempt the highest difficulty settings), but that's not necessarily a bad thing; you can expect to beat the base game in a day, while the extra content will require throwing your fragile body right into that meat grinder ever so many times. Hit detection is solid, the various ships each have interesting special abilities, boss and level design are cleverly sadistic, and the pixelated visuals are pretty alright when you get right down to it. My only real gripe is that it's a bit short, but plentiful challenge missions and a joyfully chaotic multiplayer mode more than make up for this. Overall, this is a solid, charming, affordable play for both bullet hell neophytes and veterans alike.","January 9, 2014","true","5.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It was part of a humble bundle that I bought just for the game Closure, and had no intention of playing Jamestown. Ironically, I ended up playing Closure for all of 20 minutes, and I've invested nearly 10 hours into this one.\nI rarely even play shooters, and yet this game is thoroughly addicting and enjoyable. What I like most is the simplicity. It takes 5 minutes to learn everything there is to know about how to play, and you can jump right in on the lowest difficulty and have some fun without getting crushed right away. The difficulty scales very well, and each stage requires you to beat all the previous stages on a higher difficulty level than the one before to unlock the next stage. It's a natural progression, and is suitable even for someone like myself who isn't a veteran to these types of games.\nThat being said, there are only five stages in the game which are each very short, but they are well designed and have high replay value. On top of that there are five challenge packs that you can purchase using in game currency, which range from challenging to rage inducing.\nBut what really makes this game most enjoyable are the beautiful 16-bit sprites and the art direction. A high level of detail was put into each stage, and some of the backgrounds are gorgeous. It's only too bad you don't have much time to look at them as you're constantly dodging bullets. It's got that classic old school look but at the same time has an aesthetic all its own. Plus the explosions look great, and I love how you collect gold from each enemy you destroy. Each time you blow up a ship and those chunks of gold pieces come falling down the screen, it's a real treat and feels so rewarding. Oh, and the soundtrack is awesome too.\nAll in all, if you're a fan of schmup games, this is a must buy. I paid practically nothing for it, but can say it's easily worth 10 bucks. And if you can get it on sale ($4.99 when I wrote this) then it's a no brainer.","January 1, 2014","true","9.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I actually like the fact that the final level can only be played on the highest challenge option, it makes things that much more interesting.Then there's the array of Challenge maps that can be played aside from the story it's self. One of the biggest bonuses this game has over others in this same genre is that it supports up to 4 person multi-player. While the graphics are simple they're still visually captivating and hearken back to the SNES days with a 16-bit reminiscent style.  The music is well picked and along with the graphics provide the right atmosphere for this game. I say if you like bullet hell style shooters play this game, and I feel this is also a good place for people new this type of game to start with it's progressing difficulty that allows you to work up to final boss.","January 2, 2014","true","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But I know they're very much an acquired taste, and I also know my own preferences vary wildly from others within this genre.\n\nAnyway, Jamestown feels a bit like "Baby's First Bullet Hell".  It has a pseudo-16 bit art style, but rather than playing like a 16-bit shmup, it plays much more like a modern Bullet Hell (like Touhou or one of the Cave games.)  However, the ship's hit box is fairly large, and the controls are somewhat imprecise.  So, unlike more advanced Bullet Hells, which rely on pinpoint precision, the ability to trace the directions of hundreds of projectiles, and deft maneuvering, Jamestown relys on extremely busy backgrounds (which sometimes make it difficult to separate the projectiles from "noise"), quick reflexes and much larger pattern spreads.\n\nOverall, it does feel like a good shmup for getting your feet wet, and has a bit of variety that I enjoy dipping into on occasion.  If you don't already know what kind of shmups you love, this one might be worth getting a feel for.","December 17, 2013","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Jamestown has an awesome presentation: great soundtrack, gorgeous visual and an amusing story. It has the core mechanics of a STG, but they don't quite cross the extra mile. The bosses are shallow, and the bullets can be easily predicted, yet when you play on judgement, there are too many bullets to evade them successfully. I don't want to sound overly critical, I did enjoy my time with Jamestown, but I felt sad since it wasted a lot of it's potential. The biggest negative is the lack of online multiplayer, specially when the play area is too broad for you to cover everything, and because some mobs have too much hp, you can't kill them by yourself. Overall it's a fun experience, but it could have been more. If you aren't a fan of STG, try it out; It's a great experience.

Though there are only a handful of levels, the game subtly helps you improve your skill until you'll want to play through each at least a few times. Esepcially with THAT victory music!\n\nThe presentaion is outstanding. The story may seem ridiculous, but the fantastic art, music, and writing style make every cutscene a treat. The developers spent 2 years on this and the polish shows. Everything has a memorable, adrenaline-giving feeling to it. Except Farce Mode, which is just silly and hilarious (yes, this game has a joke storyline. It's dry and applaudable.)\n\nSupports 4-player co-op (and they are working on lagless online), and every type of input imagineable. Fight Sticks and IJKL movement are go.","June 17, 2011","true","9.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While not quite as punishing as the Japanese variety in this genre, the difficulty scales up intelligently and the game eases you into the action. In order to progress farther in the game you have to get better and the game helps you get better by forcing you to play higher difficulty levels as you progress through the game. It sounds cheap, but in games like this it's way too easy to keep the difficulty low and storm through the game. The way the game progresses will show you (even those unfamiliar with the genre) how good you can be at dodging through a screenful of glowing lazers and suicidal enemy ships. Online and local multiplayer, challenges, and a quirky "farce" mode makes this game great to play if you have extra time here and there.","July 2, 2013","true","6.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As someone who has not always been a fan of the genre, I have thoroughly enjoyed it. There are some neat graphics and I like the style of the enemies. The Story Mode is rather short, but it's an intriguing twist on historical events. The bonus levels and "shoppe" provide great replay value, and playing with a partner is a blast.\n\nI do have a couple of gripes though: The UI is poor, especially in the menu, where you can't press esc or return to go back/forward, and rebinding is a painful process. There's also no health bar function on your ship, so take one hit and you're out (to be fair, players have several lives) which can be kind of frustrating.\n\nFor $10 it's a great buy. $15 would be good too, but past that I'd be on the fence due to the rather skimpy story mode.","July 21, 2012","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

With the price point (be it regular or discounted), this game is much recommended!\n\nThe only downside of Jamestown is that the game punish casual or occasional SHMUP players with its 'elevating' difficulty system, you'll have to beat stages at higher difficulties in order to unluck the next one and the only 2 difficulties available for players at the final stage are what equivalent to 'Hard Core' and 'Nightmare'\n\n","December 27, 2011","true","8.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game features an addictive point system and has some nifty features to make you keep playing for a while.  Trying to get higher in the leaderboards is always a fun thing.  The game is difficult as this genre is known for so it isn't for the casual player.  Although, the game does feature multiple difficulty levels to allow players for some practice if you are new to the genre.  Besides, 10 bucks isn't a bad deal.  I will say that the story is very odd, which shouldn't be surprising as most of these shooters have off-the-wall story lines and aren't really story driven anyway.

While not quite as punishing as the Japanese variety in this genre, the difficulty scales up intelligently and the game eases you into the action. In order to progress farther in the game you have to get better and the game helps you get better by forcing you to play higher difficulty levels as you progress through the game. It sounds cheap, but in games like this it's way too easy to keep the difficulty low and storm through the game. The way the game progresses will show you (even those unfamiliar with the genre) how good you can be at dodging through a screenful of glowing lazers and suicidal enemy ships. Online and local multiplayer, challenges, and a quirky "farce" mode makes this game great to play if you have extra time here and there.","July 2, 2013","true","6.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But if you're at least open to possibly enjoying such a game, you'll like, even love Jamestown.\n\nIts only real flaw is that its premise and story are a bit overdone (Walter Raleigh flees the Spanish in the seventeenth century by escaping to the New World, except the New World is Mars), but the execution is masterful, from the beautiful eight-bit sprites to the solid mechanics to the surprisingly superb soundtrack.\n\nThere's unlockable challenge strages, multiple ships with different secondary firing modes, a ramping difficulty to keep you improving, and even DLC with three more ships (including a fourth that randomly mimics one of the other seven).

Not bad.\n\nThat said, Jamestown ultimately centers around a simple but involving mechanic of a kind of 'overdrive mode' that is dependent on constantly collecting enemy drops for a power & score bonus. It's not a deep mechanic by any means, but it contextualizes the shooter into a constant run-and-gun, especially when enemy drops must be shared among up to 4 players in co-op.\n\nHowever, the best designed part of this game is how it encourages players to push up the difficulty ladder with a steady curve & its transparent "Points to Next Star" display; welcome to the shmups genre that basically expects players to push to the highest difficulty to get the game's "full" value.","June 14, 2011","true","9.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But beyond the amateurish mechanics and almost-but-not-quite aesthetics there’s a clear notion that Final Form is taking notes from the right teachers and applying what they’ve learned with a pure and honest energy.

And you, Sir Walter Raleigh, must stop them. With your spaceship.

The difficulty scales up quickly, and the challenge levels add to it even more. In short, Jamestown is one explosive, manic, and hilarious game.

There's a nice difficulty curve from kinda hectic on "normal", to wtf crazy on "divine," and then the highest difficulty, "judgement," just kicks out your crutches and reminds you why its called bullet hell.\n\nOh, and there's multiplayer, but as of yet it's local only, so who knows how that is.

The story is an alternate history of the real Jamestown set on Mars with aliens along with the period rivarly between Britain and Spain. Steampunk rules the time as complex machinery and shooting ships are used. The art is in pixel art, supporting the story and giving a special style to the game. Music is a mix of orchestra and rock and some synths, providing for a kick ♥♥♥ theme when playing. These 3 are all solidly made. Difficulty starts at a low level, but the game ramps it up on later levels and forces revisiting older levels on a higher difficulty.

While it's taken cues from common modern-day Flash games - including things like a shop with unlockables from points earned in-game, plus challenge levels and the like - it provides for the more hardcore shmup community as well with an arcade-style Gauntlet mode and enough points to unlock it right from the start. It also has a more classic difficulty progression, with some of the late-game stages only available to the higher difficulty levels.\n\nGameplay-wise, Final Form did their research before working on this. They followed the conventions of modern shoot-'em-ups and made sure to give it a polished feel. While there are a couple small things that bother me here and there (Dark Sector is quickly becoming That One Level for me), it's generally enjoyable all around no matter what kind of action experience you're into.","June 8, 2011","true","10.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In short it's a bullet hell shooter. If you don't know what that is basically, the enemies fill the screen with bullets and you have to dodge them while trying to rack up a high score.\n\nThe scoring system is simple but fun. When enemies die they drop gold which, when picked up, fills up your Vaunt meter. When your Vaunt meter is full you can press mouse 3 to activate Vaunt mode. In Vaunt mode a forcefield will appear around you for about 3 seconds that absorbs all bullets it comes into contact with. Your meter will slowly decrease but picking up gold will fill it up again. When Vaunt ends you get bonus points depending on how long you kept the combo going. If you die, it ends the combo and you get nothing.\n\nThere's 4 person cooperative multiplayer but it's local only, which sucks.\n\nThis game is challenging but rewarding and the soundtrack is spectacular. 100% recommended!","October 20, 2011","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Not bad.\n\nThat said, Jamestown ultimately centers around a simple but involving mechanic of a kind of 'overdrive mode' that is dependent on constantly collecting enemy drops for a power & score bonus. It's not a deep mechanic by any means, but it contextualizes the shooter into a constant run-and-gun, especially when enemy drops must be shared among up to 4 players in co-op.\n\nHowever, the best designed part of this game is how it encourages players to push up the difficulty ladder with a steady curve & its transparent "Points to Next Star" display; welcome to the shmups genre that basically expects players to push to the highest difficulty to get the game's "full" value.","June 14, 2011","true","9.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But beyond the amateurish mechanics and almost-but-not-quite aesthetics there’s a clear notion that Final Form is taking notes from the right teachers and applying what they’ve learned with a pure and honest energy.

Jamestown quenches all of these thirsts along with an unexpectedly stunning soundtrack to create a wonderful shooter for both the novice and the masochistic.\n\nThis top-down arcade sci-fi shmup is all about style. Difficulties can be chosen before each stage, ranging from the easiest resembling 1942 to Insane which will challenge any fan of the Touhou series. (If you don't know touhou, find it on youtube and it will make your eyes bleed. In a good way.)\n\nMultiple ships (with more available via DLC!), a wide array of difficulties, and an in-game unlockables via gold gained for blowing things up and creating long bonus string allow for many return plays, for both quick breaks or marathon sessions.\n\nOne downside - The 4-player Coop is SINGLE MACHINE ONLY. There is no online option. It's great for having a few people together, but in this day and age, not having online multiplayer can really limit popularity of a title. But... THAT'S IT! Everything else is a big thumbs up.\n\nIt's even got an unlockable "parody" mode. Doesn't change much, but it really adds a lovely transparency to the developers' love of oldschool shooters.\n\nThis is a shining example of what the indie game scene can do. Do yourself a favor and pick this beast up.","December 23, 2012","true","11.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It plays great and is a ton of fun, especially with co-op. You control your ship and have two moves, your normal bullets and your special move; you can use each one without limit. They only way to die is if an enemy or an enemy shot, hits the center of the ship, so you can get out of tight spots just protecting your center. You also have a meter that fills up as you kill enemies, which charges a shield to get out of difficult situations as it only lasts for a few seconds. It is easy to get into the game, but hard to master.\n\nIt is not that long of a main story, but you can sink many hours just completing the challenges, getting high scores or just playing with friends. Each ship in the game has a different special type of bullet and control very differently, offering great variety and letting the player choose whichever suits their play style best. The DLC adds 4 new ships, which personally I enjoy using more than the default ones. Definitely recommend picking up this game if you like anything mentioned above. It does what it does pretty well!\n","September 22, 2014","true","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Why can't I? Because I tend to play these games on one player, which is a common way to play for a lot of shmups, especially the Japanese arcade variety. After playing this game for a fairly lengthy amount of time it's painfully obvious that the ships and levels were definitely designed more around you playing as multiplayer. The whole vertizontal setup, lots of space for enemies to spawn and shoot from, is all very good if you were to move extremely quickly. But no, most of the ships in this environment feel like you're trying to pilot Grimlen from Great Mahou Daisakusen and you don't have any bombs to combat the fact you can barely move to where the enemies are.\n\nI'd like to imagine this game is probably a lot of fun with two players or more, but from a single player perspective this game is infuriating.

The theme is rididulous but it just makes the game more interesting. Pity the story is sort of average from what I've played. As far as the cutscenes art go, not really my style, but I'm guessing it was an attempt at creating something fitting the story.\n\nIt isn't as extreme as Ikaruga, which is a plus for me since I can't play on that level. However this game brings out a lot of interesting mechanics I've never seen from the few titles I've played from the genre. You get different ship models each with an interesting superpower which just further engages you without getting to ridiculous missile spam.\n\nNow the bad. The levels are short and you quickly get through half the story in about 20 mins. But then it orders you to play all three previous levels again in high difficulty in order to go through. This was a huge disapointment considering I hate replaying games.\n\nOverall I recommend it but be prepared to spend quite some time replaying it if you don't go straight Difficult Mode from the start.","December 24, 2013","true","0.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You’re not ready to go out like that though; you still have a lot of life in you.  So, you set out for the colonies to make a name for yourself by doing something heroic to put yourself back in the king’s favor.  You set your sights on the lost colony of Roanoke where surely you can become a hero in the war against the Spanish and nab yourself a reprieve on that execution thing.  Except…the colonies, they’re on Mars.  And the Spanish, they fight alongside the Martian Overlords.  And you, you’re going to take them all on with your retro-futuristic wooden sky jet-ski armed with lasers!\n\nI know, it sounds nutty right?  It certainly is.  The story plays directly to fans of science fiction though, especially if you’re a fan of things such as “John Carter of Mars”.   Thankfully, this shoot-em-up packs in plenty of action to spice things up and screens full of bullet hell that will keep you on your toes.  The controls are tight enough to make these moments of on screen chaos manageable.   There are times where Jamestown feels like it might be a bit of an easy mode for the classic shmup fan; Raleigh’s hitbox is very tiny and you’ll find yourself getting away with moves that you know shouldn’t be able to.  The game still manages to be a great time though and the story is so far out there, it feels worth pushing through the levels just to find out where they’re going with Sir Raleigh of Mars.\n","July 22, 2013","true","3.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It requires harder and harder baseline difficulty to unlock the latter levels, contra style.\n\nTotal there are 6 levels I think, there could be more. I got four or five unlocked. There are four different ships with distinct movement and shooting mechanics, you start out with one but can quickly buy the other three with credits earned on each level. There's a gauntlet mode where you're supposed to get through all the levels of the campaign on the different difficulties on only two credits total. A bunch of different challenges separate from the campaign levels, which do things like survive for x amount of seconds, go through a route without dying, score x amount of points in a number of seconds and so on. Really tough, but fast enough to play and try many times.\n\nA weird story I skipped past.. there's quite a bit of content overall. But all that would have been pointless if it didn't feel so incredibly good to play. They nailed the controls, speed, enemy movements and bullet speed and visibility.\n\nOn the standard ship there's a normal bullet spread type attack and a more powerful laserbeam, both weapons are just hold down button to fire. The laser shower slows down the ship a bit. You pick up cogs or scrap things for points from fallen enemies, and after x amount of pickups you can push a button to get points or level up your power level or whatever, which increases you weapon strength. There's also a combo meter which I didn't really figure out. But it's possible to click that powerup button sometimes to cash in the combo meter or something, not sure.\n\nSuper nice presentation. Everything reads incredibly well even for people who suck at shooters.","March 14, 2014","true","1.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The retro graphics and soundtrack is charming, the plot melds Victorian-era events with sci-fi and steam punk. The combination makes for a really intriguing mix.\n\nThis is a skill-based game and the tight controls and unique ship designs/weapon systems will give you countless hours of enjoyment and frustration. If you die, it's probably your fault. Thankfully, the learning curve is handled well i.e. you can't try more difficult levels until you've managed to beat the previous levels at a certain difficulty.\n\nThis is a relatively short game depending on how good you are able to master the ships and become one with the controls. I find myself favoring the game pad though a keyboard + mouse also works well. Multi-player coop is also quite fun.\n\nThe charm of this game is that it can also be played in small doses. There was a time that I couldn't beat the final boss. For several nights I try to finish the game to no avail. But after a while, I got the hang of it and managed to kill the boss. This is the point where I realized that all that time, the game was training me to get better and better.","December 28, 2013","true","15.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Jamestown is one of those kinds of games that can get relentlessly difficult, yet give you warm ups to give you the practise needed for the higher difficulties as well as the challenges.\n\nOn Normal, the story missions aren't really difficult, but you can only play through the first three missions as each one after the third requires you to beat all unlocked missions on a higher difficulty, and it's through this that you develop the skills needed to complete this game. There are only six missions, but the requirements give each level a fair degree of difficulty to finish the main game.\n\nThere are also challenges and a Gauntlet Mode (which sends you through the story mode up to the levels given with the difficult you're on in one straight run. No lives or Credits restored. 2 Continues and 2 lives per continue will be all you get!) which will give you more to do after you finish the game. Not gonna lie, I haven't made much progress with those challenges yet, but completing each one is very rewarding considering how insane some of them are.\n\nThe ships themselves differ and cater to various play styles, including the DLC ships. I find myself using the Beam (the default ship) often, but I find the Ghost is a lot of fun, and a neat shout out to Guwange (another bullet hell style game where you control your main character and a spirit, basically how this ship operates).\n\nThe music, the style, the gameplay, it's all well done and none of it seems out of place or jarring. The story is a neat throwback to the days of crazy, out there stories, and it's great fun with friends if you can get everything set up to allow them to play, being a local co-op game rather than an online one.\n\nAll in all, if you want to pick up a game, blast through some levels and beat scores or take on some harsh challenges, give this game a try!","December 30, 2013","true","2.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The game is short, but convinces you to try some of its harder difficulty modes to really get your money's worth; the later levels don't even allow "Normal" as a difficulty option. Whenever you die, it *usually* feels like it's because of a mistake you made, which is often the hallmark of a properly challenging game. In easier modes, even a wall of undodgable bullets can be overcome either by using your Vaunt ability, dying/reviving via co-op teammates, or using a lot of Continues. Then, when you've played long enough, you'll find you don't need any of those.\n\nThe variety of ships on offer also lends a lot of replayability to the game, as I found several of them very enjoyable.

I'm sorta on the fence about not recommending it, even.  But basically I played it through once and I have no desire to do it again, and that's not good.  It's kiiiiiinda an okay shmup, I guess.  The art style and the music and story are interesting and well done.  But the ship design is just terrible, and shooting things isn't satisfying at all!  How do you ♥♥♥♥ that up?  Do you design a shmup without, like, PLAYING any shmups?  I mean, for Christ's sake, Dodonpachi had better ships and that came out like, what, 20 years ago?  Every ship type Jamestown tries to play with has been done way better in at least one other game already.  Or more like every other shmup out there.  The non-BGM sound design is just... eh.  It's so flat and dull and uninteresting.  Little pew pew noises and dumb, passionless explosions.\n\nGranted, it does some interesting things?  Like, people tell me it's better in multiplayer.  Like that means anything.  And it forces you to increase the difficulty or ... you're not allowed to play levels until you replay previous ones on higher ... settings?  Wait, that's ♥♥♥♥ing stupid!  No, no.  No more fence.  Screw this game.","July 5, 2014","false","1.6"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

GREAT GAME !\n\nOVERALL This game is super fun and has a nice learning curve, starting with a rather easy shoot 'em up first level and ending with a fifth bullet hell level and one of the hardest and most frustrating end bosses I had encountered, it reminded me to the SNES era, very painful and yet so satisfying once you finally defeat him. It took me around 6h to finish the game, of which 2h were just to clear the final stage... don't judge me. In the end $10 might be a pretty fair price but if you are doubting if you'll like it then wait for a discount and then get it, preparing yourself for the great deed you will have to face to beat this game.\n\nREPLAYABILITY The game has various difficulty although if you want to finish it you need to at least complete the final level on Legendary, then you have 2 other difficulties if you are wicked good or really masochist. You also have up to 8 different ships (with the Deluxe Pack) and Gauntlet Mode which allows you to play all the stages with nothing but the 2 credits you get by normally playing a single stage (each credit allows you to endure up to 3 hits). In the end there's plenty to do if you so desire.\n\nGAMEPLAY I played it with my Xbox 360 controller and it played great, using only the left stick and 3 buttons of my controller gave me that classic arcade feel and was really enjoyable, it's pretty easy and fun to play the first 3 levels on normal using the different ships and seeing which is your favorite, then it gets more tricky when you are forced to play on higher difficulties to keep unlocking more stages, however this is for training purposes and it was a design choice by the developer. Regarding that choice I feel it's not ideal for less skillful players such as myself, in the end I did get better and managed to beat the game after a lot of effort though.\n\nAESTHETIC I love the look of this game, it's classic arcade shoot' em up visuals and I felt right at home from the times of my childhood and teen years, this games is beautiful to look at and pretty varied with stages that vary quite a lot with a big portfolio of creatures who will attack you in different ways.\n\nSTORY The story is completely absurd, and it's sorry it's not sorry, you can purchase an alternate script that's even more childish and might give you a little smirk (Plot included on the Deluxe Pack), it's a pretty wild and crazy story that might intend to make fun of other games stories since in the end people play shoot 'em ups to, well, SHOOT F*ing THINGS UP!\n\nMUSIC Now this is an area where this game truly shines, I absolutely loved this game's score, kudos to the composer who just nails it in the head with the epic soundtrack, I still hum the final boss' song in my head when I think about this game (mainly because I suffered that freaking boss a loooot of times).","September 17, 2014","true","19.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Ones like Sine Mora had me sinking countless frustrating hours in them but Jamestown was just a bit too much.\nIt’s one thing to have a lot of bullets on screen, that’s kind of the point of the genre, but Jamestown takes this to a very unappealing level by blowing up the size of everything by 100 fold. There were times that during a boss fight I could not even see the background art through all the projectiles. Mechanically this is addressed by making the hitboxes not necessarily like up with the actual art assets, but that does nothing to mitigate the fact that instead of feeling chaotically, mercilessly difficult, Jamestown just ends up feeling hopeless and not worth putting the effort into.","December 2, 2014","false","1.5"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Everyone says it's great, the reviews do too--so why don't i like it?\n\nJamestown is, in my mind, not a schmup designed to be a schmup. The rudimentary gameplay is not interesting or challenging enough to sustain prolonged interest, the enemy types are forgettable, the stages are bland and mono-paced, and the same song plays for every level, minus the last--an unforgiveable sin, to my mind, in this genre where ZUN and so many others have set such a precedent and high standard of quality for soundtrack composition. Everyone says this soundtrack is great, and i disagree--it is orchestral, emotionaless, unintuitive, and not at all designed around the experience of FLYING A SHIP SHOOTING STUFF. At the end of the day, Jamestown feels like an experience not designed around itself--the fluff is what makes the gameplay, but the fluff is stupid (no, it's /really/ stupid), and i don't like it and you can't make me like it, and therefore the game doesn't hold much weight by itself. The 'Vaunt' system is kind of cool, but ZUN's done better in every Touhou from 8 onward, so that's not much to brag about.\n\nAnyway. If you think there's a chance you'd enjoy a mediocre shooting experience with an impersonal movie soundtrack and terrible writing, buy Jamestown. i feel i was tricked. this review is brutally honest. i apologize for anyone's feelings that it hurts.","May 30","false","4.3"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","3"

For more experienced shmup players, I'd recommend passing on this one, if nothing else, you will propably get bad habits from it.\nThe game has it's moments, especially in co-op, but that's about it. Entertainment for a couple hours.\n\n\nCompared to many other shmups avaible, the game doesn't bring anything to the table. The stage design, not to mention the extremely simple and dull boss fights is a big turn off, especially the final stage is flat out horribly designed because "It's the last stage, we must make it totally different and stupid", it feels extremely out of place.\n\nDifficulty wise, if you are looking for a challenge, you won't find it until unlocking the "Judgement" difficulty.  There's a huge "false difficulty" ramp in the game when starting, simply because the background has alot of distracting factors in it, after you get used to the art style, the game is a cakewalk if you have ever played any other shmups. A few of the challenge missions were rather fun, altho not that difficult when you get the idea for each one.","April 13, 2014","false","2.0"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","7","19","0","1"

There are five campaign levels that must be beaten in Legendary difficulty in order for the player to advance. This difficulty level is appropriate for the first four levels, but on the fifth and final level, this design choice becomes a problem and a hindrance. The last level is so difficult, I consider it to be poorly designed and most importantly, inadequate. It is as if the designers realized they did not have much of a game in their hands, and decided to make the final fifth level nearly unbeatable, in order to excuse the amount of time necessary to complete the campaign. Sure, there are bonus modes/levels to be unlocked, but they are merely side distractions, that do not provide the player with additional entertainment or value. Jamestown is simply too short, in addition to one of its five levels being extremely poor. To add to this insult, the developers have released an expensive DLC for an already overpriced base game, that adds very little. The limited amount of continues is also another bad design choice because of the terrible last level. In the end, the player is left with a clear understanding that the developers resorted to a cheap and unimaginative means of prolonging Jamestown's lifespan by making it artificially and unusually difficult in the last level. Through this, it is very quick to realize that this game does not involve much, and the developers should be ashamed of themselves for charging so much for so little content. There are innumerable amounts of games of this same genre that are incomparably better, and most are more than 20 years older. Jamestown is a prime example of independent developers taking advantage of the scene and overcharging consumers for content that is extremely scarce, poorly implemented, and quite limited. There is very little to do, very little to experience, and very little to enjoy. Jamestown can be beaten in less than one hour, and there are many other games that have a much better value than this. What a waste.\n\nJamestown is mediocre.","March 20, 2014","false","4.4"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

The game has rather simple patterns along with an equally simple scoring system. But at the same time it is also quite fast paced and there are a LOT of stray bullets. I usually enjoy the slower, more bullet-dense type of shmup but this one definitely struck a chord with me regardless.\n\nGame has good art, good music.... it's a small game in scope, but everything it does it does right. The only disappointments are the lack of Steam Cloud in a game with unlocks (wasn't around at the time and never added), and that the co-op brazenly advertised in the trailer is local only.

The graphics are pretty, the minimalist story presentation hits the right notes for me, the controls are tight and the encounters seem well designed.\n\nI really enjoyed how Jamestown eases you in to the game and the genre.  It teaches you what to do as you play the game by incrementally increasing the difficulty.  This is seen in the individual levels, but also in the way Jamestown gates content: you can only play on the easier settings in the early missions - you have to improve in order to unlock the later story missions by beating missions on harder difficulty levels.  Because the gameplay itself is fun, this wasn't a frustration to me, it was a challenge that I was happy to accept.  There are also optional challenges you can complete after the main story content is over, if that's your thing.\n\nObviously a controller is pretty much required.\n\nI haven't tried out the DLC yet, that's next on the list.","July 21, 2013","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That happens to use the British colony of Jamestown as the backdrop, but its on Mars instead of the North American continent on Earth. Thats it.\nIt's incredibly fun, fairly fast paced after the initial story on each episode. A lot of replay value because of the ever increasing difficulty levels.

I had thought that, like denim overalls, top-down shooters were out of date and I had outgrown them.  Not so.  Jamestown brings back the top-down shooter in an incredibly engaging way.  There is no shortage of enemies to destroy, and when each one explodes in a shower of coins it gives a particular feeling of satisfacction.  Not to say it will be easy - they swarm and their firing patterns mean some artful dodging is required if you want to reach the final boss with enough lives intact.  Though the single player is spectacular enough, the multiplayer just pushes it over the top.  Though there is no online play, crowding around a computer with your friends and screaming at the screen has its own unique charm.","December 27, 2011","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a story element that you can simply forget about (so Mars is colonized in the medieval ages by the British, and they're at war with the spanish? Okay...nevermind. Just let me shoot some robots), an ingame shop  to unlock things (levels and ships mostly; not ship upgrades or levels) and...erm...well, that's it, really. Each ship has 2 firing methods; the 2nd one is more powerfull but slows you down.\n\nThe thing is as arcade-ish as arcade gets: 3 credits with 3 lives each level. Better survive on that, because there is no way around it (lose everything, then you'll have to restart the entire level). The only power-up/mechanic in the game is gold that, once the meter is filled, makes you invisible for a few seconds.\n\nKeep in mind that this game has only 6 levels. Note that since they're all very beautiful and challenging, that many difficulties and bonus content really stretches this out, but you have to take this into account.\nAlso...not sure if I'm the only one, but I just cannot get this game to look normal on fullscreen (1920x1080, win 8.1). Since this is the kind of game you really can't look away from your own ship, it doesn't matter as much, but still...meh. :-\\n\nStill...I prefer a short but very enjoyable game over a long stretched out one.

I've played this game a lot on the console version and I intend to as well with this one on Steam.\n\nThere's a lot of Shmups here on Steam, a lot of damn fine ones. Some are bullet hell shooters that test your vision and agility, others are straight up fragfests that just allow a lot of fun and are kind of forgiving. This game falls somewhere in between, which is perhaps the best part about it.\n\nI've been playing Shmups since the Gradius/Lifeforce days on the NES or R-Type on the SMS so I'm well versed in them but seeing as how I'm 32 now, I'm nowhere near as skilled as I once was. This is one of the few I can remember that gets me as excited as those used to. It's got that amazingly attractive Metal Slug/Neo-Geo era arcade graphical and musical style that draws you in and makes you feel like you're popping $10 worth of quarters into the machine just to beat two levels again. It's not only beautifully designed, but it also contains one of the most imaginative visions of a sci-fi world I've ever seen. Where every other Shmup follows the "Oh noes! There are aliens coming from Dimension X and only you in the prototype YXZ fighter can defeat the intergalactic hoards!" formula, this game stretches it a bit further with it's alternate reality, colonization-of-Mars instead of America take. It makes for levels you haven't seen before and attains that rare quality most Shmups outside Metal Slug fail to grasp.\n\nThe replayability is great too. The mechanic that draws you to play more is through the acquisition of cash at the end of levels which is then used in the game store to unlock new ships, weapons, levels, and game modes. It is a great method to get you to replay the 10 or so levels over and over and over. It's also one of the few Shmups where I'm actually capable of completing higher difficulties because the game does a fair job of ramping it up. It doesn't just throw you into Dark Souls: Shmup Edition.\n\nIf you love Shmups, this is honestly my favorite so far on Steam and I've played almost all of them. And do yourself a favor, get the edition with the soundtrack. It's one of the best freakin' soundtracks I've ever heard in a game.","March 22, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Note that since they're all very beautiful and challenging, that many difficulties and bonus content really stretches this out, but you have to take this into account.\nAlso...not sure if I'm the only one, but I just cannot get this game to look normal on fullscreen (1920x1080, win 8.1). Since this is the kind of game you really can't look away from your own ship, it doesn't matter as much, but still...meh. :-\\n\nStill...I prefer a short but very enjoyable game over a long stretched out one. It's not expensive yet does exactly what promised: frantic, frustrating-in-a-good-way action. So: recommended. :-)","March 20, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've played this game a lot on the console version and I intend to as well with this one on Steam.\n\nThere's a lot of Shmups here on Steam, a lot of damn fine ones. Some are bullet hell shooters that test your vision and agility, others are straight up fragfests that just allow a lot of fun and are kind of forgiving. This game falls somewhere in between, which is perhaps the best part about it.\n\nI've been playing Shmups since the Gradius/Lifeforce days on the NES or R-Type on the SMS so I'm well versed in them but seeing as how I'm 32 now, I'm nowhere near as skilled as I once was. This is one of the few I can remember that gets me as excited as those used to. It's got that amazingly attractive Metal Slug/Neo-Geo era arcade graphical and musical style that draws you in and makes you feel like you're popping $10 worth of quarters into the machine just to beat two levels again. It's not only beautifully designed, but it also contains one of the most imaginative visions of a sci-fi world I've ever seen. Where every other Shmup follows the "Oh noes! There are aliens coming from Dimension X and only you in the prototype YXZ fighter can defeat the intergalactic hoards!" formula, this game stretches it a bit further with it's alternate reality, colonization-of-Mars instead of America take. It makes for levels you haven't seen before and attains that rare quality most Shmups outside Metal Slug fail to grasp.\n\nThe replayability is great too. The mechanic that draws you to play more is through the acquisition of cash at the end of levels which is then used in the game store to unlock new ships, weapons, levels, and game modes. It is a great method to get you to replay the 10 or so levels over and over and over. It's also one of the few Shmups where I'm actually capable of completing higher difficulties because the game does a fair job of ramping it up. It doesn't just throw you into Dark Souls: Shmup Edition.\n\nIf you love Shmups, this is honestly my favorite so far on Steam and I've played almost all of them. And do yourself a favor, get the edition with the soundtrack. It's one of the best freakin' soundtracks I've ever heard in a game.","March 22, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is very easy to learn, but the final levels and the challenge mode provide more than enough difficulty for the serious gamers. With the expansion it has only gotton better. The only thing missing is online co-op, but local it is close to perfect.","July 14, 2012","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
