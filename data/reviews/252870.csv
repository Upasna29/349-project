We came underattack by many security drones who engaged us on site. They were easy prey and yielded much needed scrap that eventually sold. The crew seemed pleased. No troubles here\n\nDay 5 Cpatians Log:\nWe found a planet. It appears to be a molten planet inhabited by strange Lava creatures. I gave the order to exterminate them. No creature like that can ever be useful, or friendly. Of course, I would have sent a larger exploration force to the planet had I known there were lifeforms on the surface, but my science officer a man by the name of SCIBOT was more interested in the strange alien pumpkin that resides on the bridge than any of his duties. As soon as we dock at the nearest station He Fired.\nAs for my Engineering officer he seems more focused exploring the vast expanse of the galaxy, or finding enemies to kill than manning his post twice now we nearly had to jettison the core due to overheating. And for the life of me i dont understand how he cant keep our engines online in a fight.\nMy Tactical Officer doesnt want to use her missles and is often times facing the worng direction when we come into a fight. I swear this cannot be the same person i hired 4 days ago. Had i the techincal know how to operate the main cannon i would. I am also beginng to suspect her of an Atrium Healing pad addicition. Perhaps i could replace her and make her the new science officer she cant be any worse than SCIBOT.\nMy pilot has to be the only truely competant member of my crew he's always at his post. He's always vigilant and always ready to react to any situation.\n\nDay 5 Chief Engineers Log:\nHow did i get here? Everything was perfect when I first signed up for this gig, but now its all gone to hell. That Science Officer is worthless. I mean sure he knows his craft, but the guy is more interested in those damend pumpkins all over the ship thna he is with anything else. I'm pretty sure the Captain is going to shoot him pretty soon. Oh and the Captain is a ♥♥♥♥♥. If you push the ship too hard your going to risk a core meltdown. But noooo, every fight he has to have all systems at max power and the ship at full burn FLank speed. Any first year officer would know that with running a ship like that you're going to run a core overheat. Our weapons officer is kinda flakey too I think she just fires the main cannon to watch the pretty light more times than not I jumped on a turret just to kill the enemy. Anyway I should probably get back to fixing the engines. I almost forgot about them.\n\nDay 5 Tactical Officers Log:\nWow I've never been on a real spaceship before. Everyone here is super cool and really nice. I mean the Captian can get yelly sometimes, but he means the best. We must be like the best at our jobs because we keep getting in fights and winning. I get to fire the big shiny gun. It reminds me of the 4th of July. Anyway I'll see you later mom.\n\nDay 5 Science Officers Log:\nPumpkin. Space Pumpkin. Space Pumkin with sparkles? Space SParkle Pumpkin.

What surprised me the most was how complacent you can get. There you are with your friends just chillin' like villains after raiding a repair yard to get some free Hull repairs then you all decided to Warp to the next area. With 2:30 to kill, we play a bit of fire extinguisher tag in the lounge while somebody threatens to eject the core for funsies. As we approach our destination, we all man our stations. We warp into an area with 2 ships that each have an automated Drone to assist them offensively. "SCIENCE! GET US OUT OF HERE! EMERGENCY WARP CHARGE NOW!" I screeched. But to the entire crew's disapproval, we have not yet charged our instant jump program and are now forced to fly the unfriendly skies. We made for an asteroid to use it's caverns as cover amidst the laser barrages while we try and figure out a game plan. "2 Minutes until jump" my engineering officer yells. Knowing we can't survive for that long, I have everybody suit up as I give orders to the Pilot. "Ramming speed!

In Pulsar you take control of a spacecraft with a crew of five humans/bots and with this spacecraft you explore a huge galaxy filled with danger. As you take on, and hopefully destroy, enemies you’ll be awarded with credits which can be spent on upgrades for your craft to make it far more effective. Pulsar also allows you to send away teams onto planets to search for items, lifeforms and everything in-between.\n\nI won’t explain what the different classes in the game do but I will talk about them in my review so if you wish to know more about the classes look at the Overview in the Manual: http://www.pulsarthegame.com/manual/\n\nPresentation\nFirst up, the overall appearance of the game; it’s by no means the best looking game going but the graphical style definitely fits with the game, particularly for the ships, so I can’t fault it here. The ships themselves look absolutely fantastic, both inside and out. The character models and a few of the textures on the planets are a leaning towards the not so great side of things but this can be forgiven since you don’t spend too much time looking at either since most of the time in game is spent keeping the ship working during combat. The main menu is simple and gets the job done, not much to say here. Apart from the chat window there’s not really a UI in the game but the space craft’s ship displays are the equivalent here. The displays are what you spend most of your time looking at if you play as an engineer or a scientist but they’re also important to the other classes. They’re all done very well as they’re simple and easy to use. The one for engineering is particularly good as it’s just sliders and toggle buttons and engineers need to change things quickly.\n\nGameplay\nPulsar lets you choose from one of five (currently) ships, each with its own stats, advantages, disadvantages etc. Once you’ve selected your ship and you’ve assembled your crew you can either take and complete missions or you can just go off exploring in the randomly generated galaxy. I spent most of my time just travelling around the galaxy randomly, i.e. without trying to complete missions, and it felt rather similar to FTL. The Captain of your ship sets a course for you and then the pilot (human or AI) has to line the ship up with the system you’re travelling to so the engineer can trigger a jump to that system.\n\nArriving in a system can lead to any of the following situations: combat with one or more basic enemies, combat with a ‘boss’, the discovery of a trading post/repair depot, the discovery of a planet which can be explored or the discovery of empty space. More often than not you find yourself in the first situation so I’ll go ahead and explain how combat works. Depending on which ship you choose you’ll have a number of different weapons available to you, all of which can either be controlled by different players or can be controlled by the WeaponBot. Your weapons can only be used a certain number of times before needing to recharge, how long this recharge time is depends on what weapon it is and how much power you’ve diverted to weaponry. The recharge times are generally rather long and this is my first major issue with the gameplay since it makes combat feel rather slow whereas, in my opinion, it should be much faster paced. Enemy ships can also be boarded once a certain amount of their shields have gone down, boarding a ship allows you to kill its crew and then take over the ship or just destroy its systems.\n\nAI\nPulsar: Lost Colony is meant to be played by five real people and it shows in the quality of the currently implemented bots. Firstly, due to the nature of the bots, it’s almost impossible to run a ship with only one human player so if you’re planning to get the game, make sure you find some people to play with. However, it is possible to play with 2+ players quite comfortably, having a captain and engineer as humans and the rest as bots is effective without overworking the humans. The reason I suggest this setup is because the weapon and pilot bots seem to be as good if not better than human players at those jobs as they’re easier to automate. The devs do plan to improve the bots later in development so hopefully things while improve.\n\nPhysics\nPulsar has several issues with physics in the game, I don’t know how realistic the devs want this game to be so perhaps these issues are in fact not issues at all but I’ll list them anyway. Of course I don’t expect them to have super realistic physics in the game but something less non-realistic would be nice.\nOnce you stop firing the ship’s thrusters it gradually comes to a stop, since space is a vacuum there’s no resistance hence you should remain at the same speed as when you stopped firing the thrusters.\nPlanets have no gravitational pull on your ship.\nSome of the larger ship guns, have ridiculously large amounts of recoil, obviously there should be some force coming back from the shot (Newton’s Third Law if you’re interested) but significantly spinning the ship is over the top.\nMiscellaneousThe audio is great in the game, the sounds that the ship makes are particularly good\nThere are already a few customisation options for you character including gender, hair style, hair colour and eye colour etc.\nPersonally I think the asking price is a little steep for Early Access but if you’re willing to pay a little extra than you’d expect and you know people to play with then I’d say it’s still worth it.\nThe devs seem very proactive when it comes to fixing bugs which are reported in the forum which is really good to see for an Early Access game.\nIt’s not beginner friendly at all, the manual doesn’t go into too much detail and it doesn’t really tell you how to actually operate the ship, Pulsar would definitely benefit from a proper tutorial.\nVerdict\nWorth Purchasing.\n\nPulsar: Lost Colony is a great co-op space combat game with a vast, randomly generated galaxy, several ships to choose from and fun, if not a little slow, combat. If you’ve always wanted a  co-op version of FTL, or if you’re just looking to scratch a space game itch, Pulsar may just be the game for you.\n\nReview Copy Provided.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","September 17, 2015","true","9.8"," 217 of 236 people (92%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","92","217","236","8","22"

You'll have use of the main turret right away which stock deals a ton of damage. You'll also help out on your ship to help repel invasions.\nReviewI've been playing PULSAR since Alpha dropped and it has gone from strength to strength, I've met some good crew mates who have become good friends since. The game captures the feeling of being aboard a starship superbly.\nOf course this game is even more fun when You and your crew start to roleplay. I've lost count of how many times i've been yelling orders to my crew desperately trying to outplay the enemy startships. In my total play time i've had nothing but fun and I would honstly reccomend this game to any space fan.\n\nOne of my fondest memories so far was being in a fight against one of the sector commanders, it was a very long fight our ship was no way at all prepared for it but we all agreed to go hard or go home. After an exhausting battle and an extremely close call (We had around 30 hull left) we basked in the new found glory that we were truly unstoppable (After all, we killed one of the hardest Enemies in the game). Thats when poo started to hit the fan. We figured it was best to navigate to the nearest repair depot which was only 4 Warp jumps away (Close amirite?). So off we went, "Engineer, prepare the warp core for activation" I said. "Helmsman, Align us to SE 42" I continued, barking orders. After which we left the battleground and was on our way travelling at warp speed along our journey. The first 3 stops were quiet, a planet to beam down to and explore, scavanged a few items and we were on our way. When we got to SE 17 they were there. Waiting. I quickly changed the alert code to defend the ship, but I was too late. All three enemy ships had started to fire, our shields taking massive strain, our engineer was trying his best to allocate power accordingly but in the end it didn't matter, we weren't going to win this one. I knew that, and I believe my crew did too. We were overheating at a great pace and we were all out of coolant. Only one thing left to do I thought. "If we're going down then we are going to take them with us." I ordered our Engineer to disengage the reactor safety switch so we could eject the reactor. We did just that and managed to take two of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with us in the explosion that followed.\n\nOf course no game is without its bugs but even the ones present here get hammered down very quickly thanks to Leafy Games' super quick hotfixes.\n\n11/10 would try outsmart AI and blow up again","September 15, 2015","true","127.4"," 113 of 122 people (93%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","93","113","122","14","4"

(I hope it doesn't suck)\n\nI bought this game last night and jumped on to captain my first ship! I was really excited hadn't done any research on anything just jumped straight in, As a warning this game has no tutorial [Yet].\nWithin the first 20 minutes I had a full crew. We all jumped on teamspeak and I meet a couple of great guys that I could enjoy this game with.\nWe were excited and ready to go! We warped we Landed, we died. Very quickly. In fact this happened several times. We weren't annoyed at our death, we talked to each other about what went wrong and what we could do to improve. We got excited to get out and kick some ♥♥♥  (Finally). By the time we started to win the action heated quickly and we where all having a blast. Each role has their own tasks and they're very interesting and require intricate cooperation so you don't die a horrible fiery death. Within the first few hours of playing we'd explored planets, completed missions and killed lots of bad guys (Without dying!!!). We upgraded our ship, shields, Core, Guns, engines everything. The upgrading of the ships is unreal and one of my favourite things to do as captain. After the 4 hour mark the games difficulty started to sky rocket, we could barely kill anyone, we where getting wrecked almost every time. At this point the science guy was finally able to start his role. Running programs to keep us alive and to stop the enemy ship from moving and or keeping  shields running. We finally started to do well again and then, they attacked. the enemy bored our ship and killed us from within!!! So now we have to run a ship and fend of pirates, ♥♥♥♥ yeah! We also discovered we could do this, send on two crew to get inside and shut down their reactor bail and kill them with ease. This is the limit of what I've done so far, so I'll go on to points about good and bad.\n\nPros: To sum everything up nicely.\n- Pulsar is very cooperative, in fact working as a team is REQUIRED! Makes every player feel needed even if they're not blowing ♥♥♥♥ up.\n- Pulsar has one of the best atmospheres ever. Sounds, shacking and lighting. It really sucks you into the action even though you're in a dark room with no windows, You know when you've been shot and you're in an epic space battle!!!\n-  Ship upgrades add more depth and keep in interesting.\n\nCons: Please note this is a beta (Early Access review)\n- The balancing needs work. The game is either too hard or too easy.\n- Content, Yes I've played this game for 8 hours and I'm not bored. But this game needs some content, more ships, more exploration and more missions! We've done all the missions and making credits is getting harder...\n- First person content, is fast paced and exciting. But is currently VERY limited and feels bland compared to space combat.\n- An enemies feel and move like robots.\n\nSome idea I had, thought I could share.\n- Further ship upgrades, Shield resistance modifiers. Science already has one, but upgrades for that would be sweet.\n- Drones! Little tiny helper ships of death, win/win if you ask me.\nHull Breach, You're standing in a room that has hole and got sucked into space, too bad. Not only would it be epic but it would make the room useless. increasing difficulty.\n- Bombarding planets. You have big space guns? Why not take out enemies on the ground.\n- Capturing enemy ships for parts. It should be harder to capture a ship, but the rewards should be greater too.\n- More differences in ships, I should be able to have 10 guns on my ship! on 2 on my other ship. Or more main guns etc. OR even missile boats. So just missiles with bonuses to storage ect.\n- Tractor beam, to get items from a distance.\n- EVA, I should be able to go out of my ship in space to conduct repairs and attack the enemy head on!\n- Upgrade to computers to include a library of viruses. You could load and unload programs, You keep the current max, But you can swap them out in battle to change your load out. It would need to have a load time like, It will take 2 minutes to transfer this program or something.\n- Crew needing sleep and food, More RP like game play?\n\nI think this sums it up nicely, Hope I make sense. This game has a bright future ahead. I won't say buy it now, But I've definitely felt like it was money well spent!\n\nKeep up the work devs! You're making a one of a kind game that personally I've been waiting for!!!","October 7, 2015","true","13.9"," 87 of 91 people (96%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","96","87","91","14","0"

I haven't had this much fun playing a co-op game with people online in years.\n\nMy first time trying it  out I was on a small ship with one guy, neither of us having a clue what we were doing but we figured some things out enough to get somewhat comfortable with the basics of a couple of positions. Piloting the ship was straight-forward enough and so was manning the turrets. Time to look for a game with more people.\n\nNext game I hopped in I was the pilot. Whenever I didn't know what to do the captain was kind enough to explain, and things were simple enough to learn. I played and learned with that full crew of 5 for about an hour.\n\nNext game I was the gunner, also very simple to learn if you ever played any games in your life before, and I felt good being an important part of why we made it through fights with drones and other ships.\n\nEngineer took a bit more of friendly people explaining what things did, but I found I didn't always have a lot to do so I continued asking questions so I would have some understanding of science and captain positions.\n\nThe next night I played a game as scientist and the crew had to explain a good number of things to me, but within an hour I had a full understanding of my duties and we played for 5 hours straight.\nThat's right.

There's The Captain, The Pilot, The Scientist, The Engineer and The Weapons Specialist. So 5 players per session.\n\nIt sits on a very nice spot of "not hardcore" and "not casual". So you can easily read the compact manual about a certain role, take on a game, and most captains will be really helpful if you're a new player (in my experience).\nFor future reference, the game doesn't seem to be intended to be a hardcore sim.\n\nRegarding content, there's not enough to warrant the current price tag. It really is an Early Access project.\nHowever, there's enough fun stuff to get an idea of what's coming:\n\nGeneral Features:\n- Crew levels up, which grant talent points that the players can assign to become more efficient. Each role have general and specific traits to pick.\n- Quest system in place that gives good amounts of money, experience and helps slow down 'Chaos' build-up (more about that later).\n- Inventory and Locker system. Different guns are available, and improved tools (+3 Fire Extinguisher, etc). There's also a Scanner that helps to detect enemies and loot on planetside missions. The Captain can access and move items between crew members.\n- Every class has its station. Pilots have the helm, Scientists deal with computer programs and viruses (like heals, buffs and debuffs), scanners, and also have passive area healing, Engineers deal with the power system and warp drive, Weapons Specialist with the main guns, missiles and nuclear devices. Captain have talents that benefit the whole crew, and he'll probably be too busy coordinating missions, routes and checking fuel/components/cargo/equipment/crew request to do anything else - but generally he can do whatever he wants.\n- Captain can add money to a shared crew account ("allowance") which crew can use to buy better personal equipment. He can also, of course, withdraw money from there so a new player don't spend the last 12k on a gun that someone already have in their locker.\n- Ship can be upgraded and slightly customized (component-wise, at the moment).\n- There are AI bots if you decide to play singleplayer (or if nobody joins on multiplayer). They are not ideal, but it enables you to learn the game, and they perform well enough on their roles.\nHowever, as soon as you jump into a good session with a real crew (even on public games), you'll not want to play with AI. I already added around 10 good people in 2 days.\n- There's a save system, so you can revert if things go badly or if someone griefs you. I believe there are options like an "Ironman mode", and probably more difficulty options are planned.\n\nCombat Features:\n- Space battles that could have catastrophic results if your engineer decides to overheat your ship and eject your core, or if your scientist is drunk and refuses to set the shields properly or activate the Emergency Shields program.\n- You can already board and capture enemy ships, which include bosses that have the best ships and gear on the game. Or you can tell one of your crew members to take a walk in an enemy ship, disable their shields, destroy their Engineering Subsystem and come back.\n- Subsystems can be destroyed and repaired. They can also be set on fire, which can spread around the ship if no one looks at the Ship Status screen.\n\nExploration Features:\n- Planets that require the team to beam down and engage different enemies, find loot (including some good finds that might make the whole crew yell in excitement), and have everyone hug the Scientist and his passive healing when evil robots start firing everywhere.\n- Minefields with scrap, different systems with different features, black holes, cool sights.\n\nChaos:\nChaos is the difficulty meter of the game. It raises little by little the more you play, and the more "evil" things you do.\nIt also raises the speed by which civilized systems become "Infected" systems - which are really difficult to fight in.\n\nThere is something of a plot and NPCs on stations tells you some stories, but everything plot-related is probably planned for a later date.\n\nConclusion:\nPULSAR: Lost Colony can be VERY fun if you play with friends or people that want to go through a game properly.\nIf you enjoy cooperative multiplayer games, and like space games enough to support them early on development, by all means, join up.\nHowever, for most audiences, there's not enough content to warrant a buy at the moment. So, at least, wishlist/follow it!\n\nIf you are really on the fence, I suggest you watch some gameplay videos. I did that, and ended up buying the game.\nSee you in space, probably dying in glorious battle against a Small Drone. :)","January 6","true","18.8"," 76 of 78 people (97%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","97","76","78","10","3"

Took 10-15 minutes explaining things around the ship, and then my role in particular(Tactical). I knew some of it from watching Youtube, but I wanted to see how things were. We were already in space, and apparently our first goal was to board and take over the enemy ship. It was a rough battle, having to respawn multiple times before I realize we had taken out life support on the other ship, meaning there was no Oxygen...So after donning an environmental suit, I went over, neutralized the remaining crew and we took over the much more impressive ship.\n\nOur next few warps brought us to a derelict ship, layered with mines. After clearing the field with our turrets, scrap was ours for the gathering. We then stopped off at a space port. We repaired, sold our scrap and headed back off. We had a few other officers join and leave, but Captain Rider and myself eventually met up with a particularly resilant ship. After taking twice as long to strip the shields, the captain decided we would take that ship. We stormed it, and with better training than before, easily destroyed the critical systems for their defense and claimed the ship.\n\nVictory is sweet.","November 10, 2015","true","8.6"," 60 of 65 people (92%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","92","60","65","15","0"

I am the C.O in charge of the C.U Carrier Class "Paper Airplane" so cleverly nicknamed by Admiral Hill. My crew is of five members to whom I own my life and vice versa. On weapons is Justin who has the best record of shot to hit in the entire galaxy. On engineer is Sabakyo, a veteren in the fleet and second to none when it comes to reactor management. Rey is our pilot, he is new to the crew but quickly became close friends with everyone. Bovice on science, outstanding record from the academy graduating top of his class 4 years running.\n\nOur usual missions are that of scrap gathering.  We do, however, receive a few agressive missions like defending a mining base, or collecting rouge scout drones by any means nessasary. But last week, everything changed. There is word of an Intrepid class ship who has stolen weapons from the fleet and using them to extort civilian ships and trading outposts all across the galaxy. They are very clever and have thus been unable to be located before they strike and dissappear. We have recieved orders from CU Command that they have recently tried to sell children for credits at a trading station on the outskirts of Mineus Thrive not 5 Warps from our usual gathering spot. We have been ordered to investigate the incident report and find out why the trading depot has been radio silent.\n\nAfter a short briefing, we quickly begin preperations and head out to the trading depot. The journey was quite uneventful though I can tell the crew is a bit nervous. Hell, I am myself. "Captain, we are dropping out of warp in 10 minutes." My science officer announces to me through comms. Leaving my quarters, I head towards the bridge. Shortly after we drop out of warp to see the wreckage of the trading depot we were tasked to locate. It was horrible, debris everywhere. If not for the quick reaction time of our pilot, we may have had a collision. "Science, see if there is anywhere safe to teleport to and perhaps their computer has information as to what happened here, also do a scan for any lifeforms. Pilot give us some breathing room, i'd prefer not to have a hole in our hull before we face our true objective." I calmly order towards my crew.\n\n"No lifeforms sir, but there is a few blast doors that seal off near their comms array we may be able to get into, I'm sure if it's anything like the depots back home, they'll have at the very least audio logs of the events leading up to their destruction. Permission to beam abord?" Science hastly says after a few beeps from his station. "Granted, take weapons with you, I'm sure Colonel Justin would like to stretch his legs" I say.\n\nThe boarding party went quite fast and sure enough, Bovice was able to return with information as he anticipated. It would seem the depot refused a deal from a recent ship who ported at the depot, calling themselves the Grim Cutlass. Out of anger they opened fire on the depot, according to these logs though, they only fired once. The devistation from just one shot from this weapon was unfathomable. This in no way helped with the nerves of my crew and I was unsure of how to reasure them that this wouldn't be us if we arent careful with how we approach the AWOL ship. With little delay, we warp in the direction of the last warp trail left behind assuming it must be our culprit.\n\nMy Scientist Bovice warns me our odds of survival are increibly low. I order Engineering and Science to turn off everything and then ordered the crew into our Exo-suits. We have yet to be detected by the Grim Cutlass so we have the element of suprise. After a few moments of debate about how well our shields and hull would stand against this weapon the enemy ship has onboard, It is clear the best corse of action is to unload as much fire power we can into them before they can react. The hopes is to disable their weapons and then perhaps get them to surrender. Without their main turret active, they should crumble with fear. We drop out of warp and our scanners confirm it is the signature for our foe, the AWOL CU ship self named "Grim Cutlass". My report from CU Command says the weapon they stole when they went AWOL is a prototype weapon called the CU Long Range. We've seen it's power solely from the rubble it left behind.\n\n"Justin, charge main cannon, load shield piercers and fire at their weapons. Science, load our barrage program, Pilot, face the enemy and be prepared to dodge whatever return fire you can. Engineer, dont let us blow up" I command. "No pressure Sabakyo" Science snickers. Like clockwork, weapons locks on with shield piercer missles and charges our main turret, engineer like conducting flight of the bumblebee works at redirecting power as needed while maintaining a low core temp. Pilot ties what appeared to be a rambo bandana across his forehead and cracks his knuckles. Science was sciencing the ♥♥♥♥ out of his station.\n\nOur missle flies at almost same time the main cannon hits their shields, our auto turrets fire a few rounds of railgun ammo as our missle hits dead on. "Captain! Their weapons are disabled." Science shouts "Hail them!" I say\nOn screen was the captain of the Grim Cutlass, eye patch, exotic fur coat. Suprisingly it was a female, but more now a pirate than an ex-CU Captain. "Cowards play! she screems "How dare you fire upon an unprepared opponent! But if you leave now then i'll give you a head start before burning this sector alive to hunt you down. and KILL YOU SLOWLY" The crude space pirate sneers. "This is Captain Velcro of the Colonial Union. You are to hereby surrender yourself and your ill gotten ship to us immideatly or face destrustion." I say extremely proud that our sneak attack worked.\n\n"I refuse, but I find it absolutely hilarious that you are so arrogant that you think you've won." She barks then closes comms. "Sir! They are firing their main cannon!" Science screams. "But how?" I ask. In a blink of an eye, a large pulse of energy streaks across space towards our ship. This is it, our end i think to myself as our pilot barely manages to roll the ship out of its way. "Captain! Our engines and shields are down!" Science proclaims after taking a moment to see we are still alive. "It would seem their main turrent is on a seperate power source."\n\n"Load the nuke..." I barely can believe i said aloud knowing that we should only use it in dire situations and admitting we needed to use it was admitting this was most likely our last rodeo. "Sir! If we do at this range, well be hit by our own explosion!" my Weapon's Specialist exclaims. "He is correct, sir." My Scientist says. "Captain, I could fire full reverse thrusters and put some space between us" The Pilot states. "Doing so will require me to give more power engines and our reactor cant handle it, not after the effects of that blast we took.." Our faithful Engineer adds.\n\n"You heard me crew!" I shout. "Our window of opprotunity will be very short. If they get another shot at us we are finished. I want Science to load all our shield recharge programs, Engines alot all power to science and weapons. Once the nuke is launched, full power to engines and full reverse. I will detonate the warhead manually." I command with absolute confidence in my crew. "Science get on a railgun and shoot any missles they send our way once programs are executed."\n\nSitting there with my hand over the detonate button, my crew scrambles between their roles as the Grim Cutlass and ourselves send volley after volley of lasers and missles at eachother. I can see the damage to our systems on my screen before me piling up. Everything is going quiet around me despite the carnage. I can faintly hear Bovice saying they are firing the weapon again. Our nuke was now in range, but so were we. I close my eyes and exhale.\n\nThe Grim Cutlass is no more, but nor are we.\n\n10/10 would totally Martyr my crew again.","May 6","true","72.5"," 61 of 71 people (86%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","86","61","71","34","3"

I'll start with the english one.\nCette évaluation sera en anglais et en français. Je commence par l'anglais.\n\n\nGraphics\n\nThis game is very far from what we are used to in recent or upcoming games like Mad Max, Fallout, or Star Citizen (if we want to stay in the same game spirit).\nYou should not expect some amazing visuals in this game. However, the design of the ships, of the HUBs, and of structures on planets can easily make you forget the flaws if you like space operas like I do.\nAnd even if you don't, there is something else that can get your attention : the possibilities in the gameplay.\n\n\nGameplay\n\nI only played for about 7h at the time I'm writing this. However, I also spent a lot of time reading the manual for every role (quite useful for anyone who wants to be Captain, as you can learn all you need to know to give correct orders to your crew).\nBut I was absolutely amazed by how good the game system is. It's both complex and really simple. Complex because you need a slightly capable crew and a good captain in command to push your ship to its limits and discover all the possibilities the game offers. And simple because every panel speaks for itself and is understandable to anyone with at least 80 I.Q. The difficult part is to coordinate everyone.\n\nBecause it really is a coop game. With your friends or with stranger, you will need a good communication if you don't want to see your core explode your ship because your engineer forgot to apply the coolant liquid in the middle of a furious fight with a drone. Yeah, that can happen, trust me.\nThere is the possibility to play alone, with AI Bots in place of the different roles, but it's really not the same. And the Bots are still a work in progress and are not always responding as you'd expect.\nA good thing is, there's a small but nice community of players and an "official" teamspeak if you want to quickly find a crew and easily communicate with them.\n\n\nWhat's in the game yet ?\n\nRight now, you have several missions available, 5 different ships with differents components, weapons and internal configuration, a trade system for your ship at every station, few merchants in the main HUB to purchase better weapons or tools, the possibility to explore some planets, 5 very specific roles to control your ship and even more ...\nRemember this is still an early access, but it already has a buttload of stuff to do and discover.\n\n\nAll of that in two sentences ?\n\nIt's a better Star Trek game than any Star Trek game. It's really about managing your ship and going on an adventure, half simulation, half adventure game. The devs take care of the bugs as soon as they know there are some, there is already tons of content and even more scheduled in the next year, and if you like space opera and have some friends, this is what you need.\n\nGraphics : 6/10\nGameplay : 9.5/10 (It's awesome, but nothing is perfect)\nContent already in game : 8/10\nContent scheduled : 9/10\nDevs communication and reactivity + update frequency : 9/10\n\nOverall quality : 8.5/10 But I expect it to go at 9.5 after a fiew more updates.\n\n\n\nBien, passons maintenant à la review française.\n\nGraphismes\n\nCe jeu est très très loin de la qualité graphique que l'on trouve dans des jeux actuels ou à venir tels que Mad Max, Fallout ou encore Star Citizen (puisqu'on est dans le space opera).\nNe vous attendez donc pas à des graphismes d'une qualité hallucinante. Cependant, le design des vaisseaux, des stations et même des structures planétaires permet d'oublier tout ça, en particulier si vous aimez le genre.\nEt même si ce n'est pas le cas, vous pourrez être séduit par les possibilités laissées par le gameplay.\n\n\nGameplay\n\nAu moment où j'écris, je n'ai que 7 heures de jeu derrière moi. Cependant, j'ai passé un certain temps à étudier les sytèmes et à lire l'intégralité des manuels présents sur le site (très utile si vous incarnez le Capitaine et voulez connaitre les systèmes à votre disposition).\nEt j'ai été très impressionné de la qualité globale du système de jeu. A la fois complexe et simple d'accès.\nD'abord complexe parce que vous aurez besoin d'un équipage réactif et d'un capitaine compétent pour pouvoir pousser votre vaisseau à ses limites et découvrir tout ce qu'il a à offrir. Et en même temps simple car chaque panneau de contrôle est relativement clair et peut être compris par n'importe qui. La vraie difficulté est de coordonner l'équipage.\n\nCar c'est bel et bien un jeu de coopération. Que ce soit avec des amis ou avec des inconnus, vous aurez besoin d'un bonne communication si vous ne voulez pas que votre réacteur surchauffe et vous explose dans les mains parce que votre ingénieur n'avais pas appliqué le liquide de refroidissement. Oui, ça arrive, croyez moi.\nIl y a la possibilité de jouer tout seul, en plaçant des bots aux différents postes, mais l'expérience n'est pas du tout la même.

The player, with up to 4 other crewmates, travels by the galaxy in a spaceship. Every person will be asigned to a role, being these the Captain, the Pilot, the Engineer, the Scientist, and the Weapons Specialist. Cooperation of all crew members will be needed to survive each threat they will encounter(mostly, enemy vessels or drones in space, aliens in planets).\n\nI recommend to the person insterested in the game to watch some videos, because it really gives the sensation of being part of a vessel crew, giving a lot of tense situations, with the pilot running away from enemy shots, the captain giving orders, the WS trying to hit the enemy vessel and, when everything seems lost, the engineer screaming "WARP DRIVE CHARGED AND READY, WE'RE ♥♥♥♥ING GOING OUTTA HERE" and jumping to hyperspace after an eternal time lapse where the drive took forever to charge.\n\nPerfect for playing with friends. It needs more content, but game gets updated every month with new features.

I see a lot of potential in this game. As-is, in early access release, there are some quirks, and have even had my server crash while playing with some pals. But, despite that, I'd still recommend playing this game. I was so excited by the initial play that I went out, and bought copies for buddies to get them on-board.\n\nNot meaning to steal thunder from this game, it does remind me of a slightly different variation on "Artemis - Bridge Simulator". Different game styles, as Artemis is designed for the group to be in the same room, and the console is the console of the bridge, rather than you controlling an avatar operating a console, the spirit of the game is the same. A grand social design to get players working together towards operating the same ship, with well defined roles.\n\nGranted, there are some things still not working in the game yet, and some odd ball quirks for getting around the galaxy, such as the missing waypoints when the captain issues orders by the starmap, it's very easily overcome. I don't mind asking for each sector to be the next jump alignment to get us going. It gives the captain a little more to do when there isn't fights, and fires, and away team missions.\n\nIn the end, this is a seriously fantastic game for those who want to work cooperatively with a group in control of their respective components of a ship. Very well done.\n\nDear dev's, PLEASE keep the work going on this. You have a life-time player, and advocate of your work from me.\n\n10/10, would boldy go again!\n","December 1, 2015","true","15.6"," 35 of 35 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","35","35","0","0"

I thought it would be another bad early access game as soon as I looked at the trailers. Much to my delight, I was wrong about this game.\n\nAs soon as I jumped in I had absolutely no clue what I was doing and went around and started flipping switches. This all would've made sense if I had just read the manual which is actually very useful.\n\nAs of right now, this game has a decent amount of content for being Alpha. There are also not that many bugs and apparently this is because the dev team actually want to focus on the bugs and roll out content in Alpha. The framework is strong so I think that the content will come fairly quickly and consistently once they reach that stage.\n\nMultiplayer works amazingly. The Teamspeak integration allows players to enjoy the best in-game voice chat that I have ever used. Voice comes through crystal clear and doesn't have any real problems.\n\nThere are not really any major bugs that I have encountered so far which is one of the reasons I decided to pay for this game and not pirate it.\n\nThe dev team also does not plan on raising the price in the future so if you don't want to jump on board the early access train, you can certainly wait.\n\nWith that being said, I hope everyone purchases this as soon as possible so that the developers have more money to work with because they have an early access project that is actually worth funding and seeing through.\n\nAs of right now, I would give this game an  8/10. Performance could probably be improved a litte bit and the AI is a bit wonky. Combat is also a little frustrating right now but I know that it will be improved as time goes on. I really can't wait to see what all Leafy Games has in store and I know that once they reach release, this will definitely be a 10/10 game.

It had all the good stuff! Space exploration, space ships, space battles, space ants/spiders/robots, and it had space itself. I started playing it, and I just couldn't stop. Started out joining a random game where someone taught me all the basics. And hell, there are a lot of basics! Learning the game is pretty overwhelming at first. Untill you have played all 4 support roles it is hard to be the captain.\n\nThus, the day after the basics I decided to dedicate my day comandeering the U.S.S. Flying dutchman. I found some people, put them on a teamspeak and we played for about 8 hours straight. The experience was amazing! I lead us to planets, bandits, dronespaceships, and all there is to do. Everyone was immersed in their role, and achieving the goals I set for them. The one main problem we found out though was this.\nAfter 8 hours of playing the game, we had seen it all. We had beaten both bosses, seen the infected ( which you cant actually kill yet.), been to all exotic shops, upgraded all the gear on the ship untill there was no proper match for us anymore. It was lacking content, but I kept longing for more.\n\nTl;Dr?\n\nPro's:\n-Awesome gameplay. You are free to do w/e you want.\n-Game really promotes player interaction. You have to function as a team. No soloing here.\n-It is very immersive. You get into your role and stick with it almost naturally.\n\nCons:\n-Some minor bugs. Server list not reloading, mines not blowing up, laser targetting messing up etc.\n-Severe lack of content though this will most probably be worked on by the dev team!\n-The game will take you and make you play it till theres nothing left to play. (might actually be a good thing)\n-Game is quite boring without actual voice chat. (might be different for you)\n\nFinal verdict:\nBuy this! But if you're patient enough, wait for a couple of months untill there is more content.","September 25, 2015","true","13.6"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

You've probably seen all the other reviews saying this game is like FTl, but in 3D. Well, that's exactly true. I'll add that the way you control all of the systems is by going up to a display and simply clicking on the buttons you want to select, no pressing an 'interact button' first or anything; it certainly adds an extra level of realism. This game seems as close as you could come to playing as a member of the crew on the starship enterprise, sprinting around and managing the ship's sytems.\n\nI WILL say that in the current state (Nov. 5th, 2015), the universe is a little shallow, a few mechanics haven't been fully flushed out, and some of the player models and environment models still need a lot of work.

Although im not sure this is implemented yet, the goal of the game through my experience, says we need to repel the "infected", a organic apocalypse growing through space (and very lethal!). This may only be accomplished by  buying nukes in exotic shops , or if youre a tactical genius, you may just find another way. In any case, teamwork is definitly a thing here, and tactics on what to upgrade, since the game has a "FTL-ish" styled increasing curve in difficulity, known as the "chaos level". This increases each time you jump, and you cannot counter the increase of the chaos level. Also, besides from being inside your ship, you can explore planets (which currently are static locations), board enemy ships (Better get a better gun first...), which really extends the potential of the game. I can't wait to see what the future of this game will bring.\n\nBut please fix the resolution problem, if this has something to do with the technical difficulities of PULSAR: LC.","March 12","true","28.8"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"

Run around your ship, that of your enemy, space stations, planet surfaces whilst assisting through the role you pick and excelling in performing in it.\n\nThe graphics are reasonably, but not excessively realistic. In a game like this I find graphics not as important as the mechanics and environments that provide the actual immersion. The game mechanics are such that the different roles one can assume really rely on eachother, but there are some things that could be improved in that department.\n\nThe sound effects are good, but again, in my opinion not as important as the game mechanics and the roles people fill with their characters.\n\nThere are still some bugs, and most environments tend to become a little dull after a while, but that's all work in progress. I would also love to see even more involvement of certain roles. The Pilot role for instance doesn't seem as important at times, and the available options for the other roles also seem a bit limited and could do with some expansion.\n\nWith the addition of in-game voicechat (which to be honest, I haven't tested yet myself, but I will later tonight) I think this game and its developers are going in the right direction, and I have high hopes for this title.\n\nIt is already well worth its price, well executed and incredibly addictive to play.

There have been 5 updates, of which 2 were advertised as 'major'. None of them addressed the issues that have been pointed by the community. The idea is still there, and there certainly have been improvements- however the game still fails to provide enough value for its' cost.\n\nA good indicator of how PULSAR fails to keep people interested, even those that were initially excited about it, is the average playtime of the reviewers.\nIts' bad retention rate can also be assumed from the very low number of average and peak concurrent players (http://steamcharts.com/app/252870#All)\n\nI'll certainly keep an eye on it, and hope it will sometime fulfill its' potential, but at its' current state, price and rate of improvement, I wouldn't recommend purchasing it.\n\n\nBeta 1.2 preview\nPulsar: Lost Colony is a very unique game. It draws heavy inspiration from genre-defining classics such as Star Trek and Firefly, and tries to provide a similar gaming experience, better than any game has so far managed to do. Its' mechanics might seem overly complex or even chaotic at first (and the lack of a tutorial doesn't help), but it doesn't take that long before getting used to how everything works.\n\nGameplay\nA large portion of the gameplay consists of operating your ship through the use of monitors, flips and switches, controlling functions such as energy flow, offensive/defensive software, core temperature etc. Even though the UI can look archaic and out-of-place for an intergalactic spaceship, these monitors succeed in creating immersive and sometimes even frantic gameplay that rewards fast decision-making and combat awareness.\nAnother imporant aspect of Pulsar's gameplay is the ability to leave your spaceship, either to board enemy ships (for a manlier offensive approach) or to explore planets and outposts. Even though the concept is there, the excitement you get from visiting planets is doomed to be on a progressive decline immediately after the first few expeditions, since the ecosystems and architectures available are extremely limited at this point, and most planets' explorable zones are far too small and generic to be jaw-dropping. One can assume, though, that this is an issue that's going to be adressed sooner or later, as more content is being added, resulting in more randomly generated variations and hopefully more non-random, unique planets and outposts. Boarding enemy ships is also quite enjoyable, and allows you to steal initially unavailable spaceships.\nOther parts of the experience Pulsar has to offer include piloting, manning turrets, trading parts to upgrade your ship, using public restrooms, turning interior lights on and off (for a superb rave party experience), isolating yourself in the captain's cabin as well as a currently lackluster quest system.\n\nClasses\nRole assignment is handled through five classes, each with its' own perks (available through leveling-up). The Captain controls the flow of the game and commands the crew, the Pilot steers the ship, the Engineer is responsible for the energy management, the Scientist ..uses software and the Weapons guy mans the turrets. Roles are fluid and can dynamically change during engagements, thus requiring effective communication between crew members, as is always the case with these kind of games. Even though the classes themselves are on spot, each one's gameplay isn't as deep or rewarding as the other's (with the Pilot and especially the Scientist suffering the most, as they have limited impact and almost no unique presence in the game).\nClass talents are also in certain need of rework, as some are completely must-have whereas others fall into the meh/useless category, resulting in practically no choice over which talents to level and when. Their number is also limited- class talents can be maxed out after just a couple of hours.\n\nTechnical\nGraphics are definitely not state-of-the-art. They certainly don't fail to convey the eeriness of space, but there's room for improvement, especially on characters and animations.\nSound is decent. The soundtrack could be more ambient and trippy- I feel the current background music is rather blant but I guess that's personal taste. The sound effects are especially well-made and convincing, and there's at least one for every major event (warping, taking hull damage, being set on fire, being shot in the face by a space-robot-bandit etc.)\nPerformance was flawless on a system just below the recommended specs, and I was even able to run it decently on a dated laptop just above the minimum specs.\nBugs do occur once in a while, and they can sometimes force you to quit and reload, but that's rather rare (2 forced reloads in 14 hours).\n\n\nTL;DR+Great potential\n+Fun, unique concept\n+Well implemented mechanics\n+Obviously made with love and passion\n-Graphics aren't really great\n-Limited content\n-Classes and talents need work\n-Game wouldn't let us warp away and leave our bossy captain behind in a desolate desert planet\n\nOverall, the game is already super fun to play with friends, especially if you're into sci-fi. If you don't mind the occasional bugs (of which there really aren't thaaat many), the slight class balance issues, the limited content, the rather high price, and can look past the non-realistic graphics, I recommend buying this game. Otherwise, you may want to wait a bit for some polishing to get done and some extra content to be added.","September 15, 2015","false","22.1"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","20","30","0","0"

Very similar in crew roles and responsibilities to Artemis: Spaceship bridge simulator (also reccommended) with the added ability to go on away missions and added RPG elements to crew members and abilities.\n\nBasically, become the crew of your preferred sci-fi universe and run the ship as though you were Captain Kirk/Mr. Spock.\n\nPlay as the Captain, Science officer, Engineer, Weapons officer or Pilot, each having their own roles, responsibilites, strengths and weaknesses for each situation you come across.\n\nNot for people who want pretty, pretty graphics but if you like solid - if obviously incomplete gameplay, you'll love this. Crew stations and other mechanics need to be explained better but the game is pretty easy once you get the hang of it.\n\nOne thing that I think really needs to be added is the ability to have multiple crews - the galaxy is just massive and it'd take forever for a single crew to explore the whole thing.

How to put this...\nThis is a freakin, AMAZING GAME.\nShall I simplify?\nNah I don't have to.\nBut I should.\nBecause it's awesome and you should know why if you haven't bought it already.\nWhich you should have.\nBecause its awesome.\nAaaaaaaanyway.\n\nThe graphics aren't great, but.. hey who cares? The gameplay rocks!\nYou have to work as a team or your ship will die, it has a very 'firefly, star trek, galaxy quest' style of gameplay where you all choose roles etc. I was the weapons specialist and my job was to fire big guns and be the away team, so essentially what you'd call a red shirt.\nI always died.\n\nThe cons:\nWell, it's beta, so there are a few bugs, and the diversity of equipment is low.\nBut that's all I found to gripe about.\n\nIn my first two hours, I:\nBeamed down onto a lava planet in my exosuit with the crew and killed a bunch of slugs in some caves.\nWent to numerous desert planets and icy planets.\nSaw my Captain get swollowed up by some giant worm like thing.\nGot eaten by a bunch of large ants whilst exploring some old ruins.\nBlew up an enemy ship whilst my captain was aboard.\nGot shot by some robot thingy.\nAnd developed an unnatural fondness with the nuke we had on board the ship.\n\nWhat a misfit crew we made.\n\nSo.... Essentially this game has been one of the most enjoyable games I have played of late; having found myself bored with games and desperately looking for some relief... This, this is the game. And in the first two hours I have done so much, bonded with the crew. It truly is one of the best games on steam, and is very worth the amount of money it costs. The development team listens closely to it's fans and is very active. I was following their youtube channel for a year keeping up with the dev logs.\n\nBasically, buy it.

After years and years of competitive PvP and shooters its nice to have a game that forces players to work together.  Every team member has a special and crucial skillset.  In almost every encounter each member of the team will need to act quickly and coordinate their actions with each other.  Within a few warps and after a couple battles your teamspeak will inevitably start to sound like an episode of Star Trek.  The learning curve is a bit steep but rewarding.  I've played for 25 hours and still have encounters that surprise me, although the main weakness this game has is lack of content.  It can get boring fighting one security drone after another.  The team is adding more and more content and we get updates every week or two.

The most recent major update in Beta 8 allowed you to hail other ships, instead of just flat out fight them the second you see them. It really adds to the immersion of the whole game.\n\nWith any game there's bugs, but none are overwhelmingly large enough to be game breaking and most are minor, for now. The devs have done a good job in QA testing their game and each update. Whenever they see a bug they usually do their best to fix it ASAP. Sometimes a bugfix will come in a patch version big enough to actually introduce a few tidbits of new content too. Always a good thing.\n\nSome things are actually still missing, for instance; there's some key elements to the lore that are implied but not written in stone or shown in the game just yet. Updates have done their best to bring in more lore based content alongside meaningful core mechanics to the game. It should be made clear the devs are focusing on getting all core mechanics down first, before focusing on any big time content. Regardless, the game is still a bit vast in these initial stages.\n\nSome people on the forums on the dev's website have suggested removing warp times and simply allowing a Captain to choose when to skip a warp. This would likely be a very good idea; if your ship has been damaged heavily in a firefight, being in that warp gives you the time to do what you can to get it battle ready, despite whatever shape it's in. Furthermore, let's say your crew is RPing? It would be perfect for RPing crews to use that time inbetween warps to socialize amongst crew and advance their own story. Despite these reasons, the devs have yet to make any adjustments let alone make any comments about this (to my knowledge). This so far, in my view, the only major con.\n\nPulsar: LC is a well done game. There are things that need to be done, but for what it is right now, it is a well done game.","May 12","true","221.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's in early access, which never really fills me with hope. However, from what I've seen so far, it shows a great deal of promise (which could be said for other games, really) and the developers are working tirelessly with the playerbase to stabilise and improve the game.\nThe game itself is an interesting concept. 5 players, each with their own role, working together in order to complete missions. Already it sounds like a number of games, but the way that Pulsar does this is not quite what you'd expect (unless you happen to expect something along the lines of guns of spacearus). Bots are available, but I'm writing this review with a Co-op impression in mind.\nThese 5 players are given a Spaceship and a role aboard it. Then, they're left to their own devices. The Galaxy is open to them from T minus 0, and there's quite a wealth of things to do. I recommend finding out firsthand. The game doesn't ease the player in very much. They are briefed on their role, but I learned quickly when I had someone talk me over the ship in a couple of minutes. Of course, there is some reading material that you could make use of.\nThe game doesn't hold your hand. The further out you go, the harder things are going to get. Work with your team and you can overcome all. Surely, this game has a thing for improving communication and building cohesion, However, I recommend a clear medium of communication, such as a Vent, person-person proximity, Teamspeak, and so on. As far as I am aware, there is no in-game VoIP. The options aren't great, and you may have an issue running the game. It's on Unity, I think.\nI wish I could rate things out of 10 easily, but I don't really think that way. I think you could describe the entire game, so far, as Guns of Spacearus Online, the PVE sandpaign.","September 17, 2015","true","39.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

However, instead of flying around a single sector, there's an entire galaxy out there to explore with factions, hostile aliens, and several missions to give you and your buddies some direction.\n\nChoose between one of five ships, and if you don't happen to like one, go ahead and board a ship of another type and take it for yourself! Upgrade your ship from parts of destroyed vessels or go on an away mission to a planet and look for salvage. There's something out there though, as my buddies and I explored we noticed some kind of infection sweeping over the galaxy and taking over as the literal chaos level increased. We haven't actually encountered it yet, but I read about alien monstrosities burrowing through the hull and attacking us from within.\n\nIt's Early Access Beta, and while the majority of the content isn't in the game yet, most of the core of the game is complete. Visit and walk around on space stations! Board enemy ships and capture them! Go planetside and search for relics, aliens, and clues to the titular Lost Colony! Go up in flames as your ship burns! Load the Nukes and pay them back with your dying breath! Boldly go wherever the hell you want with your only guide being how many credits you have left to gas up your tank, and your four buddies who might want to see what's JUST around the next bend - to blast it, analyze it, or turn it's leftover clink into some drink at the bar.\n\nEarly Access, yeah, I'm familiar with it. But I don't regret a thing this time, and I don't think you will either. This is the first best chance for a cooperative starship simulator in... ever. Throw some money at it, fund development, and get you some.\n\nAnd hey, if you don't see any potential in it after you've had a look - steam refunds exist, so I say grab your friends and give it a shot.\n\nRECOMMENDED.","September 15, 2015","true","21.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

However, if you are able to get a full group (5 people) of friends it creates a great experience. I've played a few bridge simulators and there are none better than this. There are 5 different roles and you cannot only travel around a 3D huge scaled ship, you can board other AI ships to take them over, land on planets and loot, and shop in local shops. Team work is required!\n\nI would not recommend this title if you are playing solo since it is hard to find other teams to play with (especially if you do not have a mic!). The AI for your crew is not that great (but better than no one) and would again, would not recommend playing solo especially for a single player experience. Playing with random crew members can be hit and miss, especially since there are quite a number of players that feel the need to just wreak havoc to your ship just for fun.\n\nOtherwise, if you can get a group, I highly recommend this title.

Now however, this is definitely something you should pick up if running your own starship sounds intriguing to you.

This game is a wonderful concept, and quite frankly is the game I have been searching for on steam recently, and open-world, first person space sim-them up. And for an early access game, it has some great core mechanics in place and runs very smoothly on my R9 270. But it is just that, an early access game, and it doesn't quite have enough to warrant that £18.99 price tag. I don't particularly like the art style (personal preference) and would like to see it take a turn to the more realistic side. My point is this:\n- It is an early access game, if you like to bug report and are really hyped for this game, then buy it.\n- If you want to jump into a space sim game in the deep end with no tutorial (at the moment), then buy it.\n- If none of the above apply to you, than wait. This will be an amazing game judging by what I have seen on steam and on the website. What they have planned for this is great. But at the moment, it doesn't have enough of the core mechanics in place. At least not for me. So what I'm doing and I recommend, is waiting until it is at a later build, or when it is fully released and buying it as a full game. It has great potential. Just lakes a few essentials for me at the moment.\n(I know I didn't play much but it was enough for me)\n\nI don't know how many people are working on and developing this. But keep going.

Extremely in depth controls and options for each class as you have to control the functionality of the ship and it's exploration as only one of the members of the crew.  If something goes awry, you have to manually run to that section of the ship to take care of the situation in person as opposed to controlling the outcome via quick-time event.

Next comes the unknown online players (if you have the game set to private) who, if your lucky, will not instantly try to sabotage your ship and then eject your core.\nOnce your crew is settled in and you spend the next 20 minutes gathering the missions from the station and purchasing the upgrades you want from the store you warp to the next sector to begin actually playing the game.

Up to five players collaborate to tackle exploration and combat objectives.\n\nEach player assumes a role in a small starship crew: Captain, Scientist, Pilot, Engineer, or Weapons Specialist.  Working together, the crew travels across a randomized galaxy to overcome various obstacles.  Exploration missions task the crew with travelling to remote locations to retrieve items or investigate an area.  Combat includes ship-to-ship battles as well as gunfights between individual players and opposing NPCs.  Enemy ships may be boarded and seized, or destroyed for scrap.\n\nEach player has specific responsibilities.  The Scientist operates the ship's sensors, shield configuration, and opens communications with other vessels.  The Engineer manages the ship's power systems to ensure various parts of the craft are able to operate, without overheating the reactor.  The Pilot flies the craft and acts as the crew's "eyes" - identifying hazards or items of interest that do not appear on sensors.  The Weapons Specialist mans the ship's turrets and acts as the craft's security officer.  Finally, the Captain (the player hosting the game) is the crew's decision maker - managing missions, diplomacy over comms, and overseeing the crew's finances.\n\nSimply put, PULSAR: Lost Colony is a great game.

At the moment, the game has a few recycled textures which allows it to run fast.\n\nThe ships at the moment are limited. However with the introduction of the Roland-class, we can see a potential for larger ships and perhaps hybrid AI/Human crew. Each ship has their own unique traits or abilities which allow for different styles of play. However the end game items overshadows these abilities which results in the same endgame play. Ship systems as of Beta 1 are moderately balanced however with AI controlled turrets, the main turret becomes less of a priority to man since the AI can hit it's target most of the time when you have a good pilot.\n\nThe ground combat at the moment is a good step in the right direction. Variable landscape that change how the player has to adapt. The new environmental suits allow you to travel to dangerous locations without harm and the weapons are based on a tried and true trade-off method (one shoots fast but weak, one shoots slow but fast, etc.). At the moment, the gameplay requires players to dodge gun fire or melee attacks. Requires every little tactical movement when shooting back so players can easily duck behind cover to protect themselves. Player customization is fairly fixed on implants and tattoos, but allow for colour changes. Otherwise the customization is vast on hairstyles, facial and colour options.\n\nLike to see more in the future from Leafy Games, but I would deem this a playable Early Access and recommendable to anyone who enjoyed Star Trek: Elite Force with a mix of Artemis Ship Simulator.\n\n\n(Psst, my YouTube Channel if anyone wants a peak of all the things that have progressed in game: https://www.youtube.com/user/nawkcire)","September 15, 2015","true","64.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Good devs. Lots of potential. It is funny how easily random people who join your crew can get into their roles both in terms of mechanics and role playing. The Captain is usually treated as the Captain and so on. There is a large galaxy to explore. Upgrading your ship and crew skills adds some sense of progression.\n\nCONS: The content in the game is quite limited at the moment(though there is enough to sink your teeth into). The graphics are basic but it still has a decent aesthetic.\n\nI look forward to the eventual fleshing out of ship's systems, crew abilities, AI interactions, missions, and planetary exploration. Like I said there is a lot of potential and a lot of features that can be added.\n\nAt around 17 hours I feel I have gotten my money's worth so anything extra is just icing on the cake.","September 15, 2015","true","17.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","4"

While the graphics leave much to be desired compared to modern games, if you're going to judge games based on graphics then you will miss out on some series gold.\n\nThis game makes players work together, otherwise you won't get very far. You can do pretty much anything, from exploring ruins and crashes, to fighting against impossible odds against enemies stronger than you. The universe to explore is much larger than what you'd expect, and with the constant updates there is no shortage of new content being added to the game.\n\nIt is a great game, the only thing they need to do is add ships for smaller crews. I don't have enough friends who are interested in the game to fill a whole crew, it's mainly just me and a single friend. If they could release some ships for 2-4 man crews it would compelte the game.","September 15, 2015","true","5.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The developers are true gamers, they seemed to add in everything you could of ever wanted to a co-op space sim. It is still early but the game shows a huge amount of promise.  Dont go in expecting next generation graphics like ARK or flawless AI, go in looking for something orginal and well thought out.\n\nPros:\nUnique play style.  Nothing really like this out there\nEveryone has a job to do.\nIt really is epic.  They have a cool piloting mode that lets you fly the ship with wasd and the mouse. You just have to experience it.\nQuest...check.  Huge random open world...check.   RPG elements...check.  Random encouters...check.  Ship to ship combat...check.  Board enemy ships or get boarded...check.  Beam down to planets...check.  Fly in wrecked stations for loot...check.\n\nCons:\nAI helpers are ok at best.  They pilot like crap and barely do anything more than take fire when you are boarded.  The developers are working on that.\nCharacter graphics are just plain bad.  Doesn't really bother me but some people might have a problem.  It is about game play and it is in beta.\nYou need friends.  Get on reddit or look at forums plenty of people out there who want to fly if you dont have any buds.\nWood panels on the floors in spaceships.  Dont know how I feel about that.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nPulsar brings a lot to the table and in a very early version is more than playable for many many hours.  If the big boys like Elite, SC or STO every figured out how to implement this level of co-op into thier games we would have a tough time figuring out what to play.  This is what STO should of been and what Elite and SC could have to make them true winners.\n","October 20, 2015","true","15.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Relative to star trek, artemis is like dungeons and dragons, and this is like the witcher 3. Whilst artemis is more technical, this has better combat, better flight and I prefer the look of all the other stations. You just have more stuff to do. Also, this can be done in theory with 2 people, although 3 minimum is recommended and 5 is best.\n\nI love this game. It now has HOTAS support, and in game voice chat so it should be the absolute best game of its kind. For flight, Elite dangerous is probably better, but this emphasises team work and other roles.","September 15, 2015","true","8.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Don't get all mad because it doesn't allign with your opinion.\n\nI have been following this game since it first came out on greenlight. This was around the time I still played Artemis: Spaceship Bridge Simulator and what this game promised was that game, but ten billion times better. First person ship bridge simulator is exactly what I wanted and I'm happy to say, this game delivers like there is no tomorrow.\n\nThe game like I said is a first person multiplayer spaceship exploration/combat simulator. I first got the game when it was in early alpha and even though it was very rough, the game still had tons of features and charm. You and perferably 4 other friends begin their journey on one of the five ships avaible (ATM) each with its own personal style of play and interior/exterior looks. One of the things I was really looking for in this kind of game was ship system interaction. By this I mean as a player I control the ship in anyway I want. Its not just go forward and back, shoot weapons, and so on, I can control where the power goes around the ship, I can scan the sector for enemies, I can use programs that boost stats or viruses that infect enemy computer, I can tweak what subsystem need power from lights to atmospherics. The goal of the game is go through this procedurally generated galaxy and kill enemies for scrap. Once you do so you buy upgrades at shops and equip them on your ship. After this you will eventually be powerful enough to take on the galaxy boss and claim victory. On the way to this main goal there is so much to do and see so lets go over some of that.\n\nThings to do:\n1. Kill enemies.\n2. Loot abondoned space stations and structures for scrap all while avoiding dangerous mines.\n3. Find a high class enemy ship and prepare to board!\n4. Kill everything last thing on this enemy ship and hack is subsystems to take control of it!\n5. Use your new sexy ship to fly to a planet.\n6. Use your teleporter and beam down to the surface.\n7. Don't forget your space suit because humans need oxygen.\n8. Explore abondoned strucutes on the surface for food, weapons, collectables, and more!\n9. Tell your friend to walk out into the desert by himself/herself but DONT tell him/her about the evil sand worm.\n10. Find sector 0 and enter the famous Colonial Hub and meet new people and accept quests!\n11. Get lost in the Colonial Hub\n12. Fly into a sector with either a high level enemy or many enemies\n13. Panic because you shields are down\n14. REALLY panic because your ship is blaring its sirens and there are lots of red lights and evERYTHING IS SHAKING OH GOD\n15. Die\n16. Return more motivated than ever.\n16. Pay taxes to use the Long Range Warp Station to move around faster.\n17. Spend skill points to make yourself and your kick-♥♥♥ crew even better!\n18. Customize your apperance.\n19. Try to overthrow the captain.\n20. Fail at mutany\n21. Get ingrossed in something and forget about the heat level of your reactor.\n22. Panic AGAIN because all your system turned off due to emergency cooling.\n23. Wonder what this switch does and eject your loving core out into space (What did it ever do to you!?)\n24. Run out of fuel and have to open up your emergency broadcast beacon.\n25. Pray to the space whales that someone nice will come to your aid.\n26. Die from someone not so nice.\n27. Get determined to win the game (or at least progress as far as you can in the games current state)\n28. Do the process all again but not die\n29. Get hype for you epic finale boss.\n30. Pump your epic music so that your parents get annoyed.\n31. Shoot the crap out of the boss using your skills and that handy dandy nuke you forgot about.\n32. Revel in your victory and attempt to self destruct the ship.\n33. Die\n34. Give this game a thumbs up on Steam because of how awesome it is!\n\nWhat I covered about is not all that you can do. Its an open world space game so you can make up stories, role play, and gather your buddies for a awesome LAN party thats not actually LAN because the game doesn't have that feature yet BUT it will. Anyways this game is great on almost all sides. I didn't even mention it but the art style is very clean but detailed and easy to look at. All in all I can give this game tons of my love and I think you should too! If your reading this and you know you could even slightly enjoy this game then you should really click that buy button. Lastly the devs to this game are super open about their development and are awesome dudes. They would love to help you with problems and so would the Pulsar community. The devs even have had polling sessions to vote on content that will be in the game! So buy the game or don't, if you don't your missing out on the best open world spaceship bridge simulator to date.\n\nIf you would like to see more I have a series of the game where me and some friend try our best to plow to the final boss. I will put a link to the first episode if you want to watch it. If not then don't, this isn't ment to be some plug or whatever but if you must think that it is, then i'm shamless about it :) Take care.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kWIOClo4jg","September 15, 2015","true","15.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

When you're playing you're not just pressing E (or in this case R) on a console and that automatically cools the core, you need to lower that power usage or turn on the coolant (or both). Are the programs out of charge? Get your butt in engineering, load that fuel cell, and pull that lever. Want to know what that enemy ship has, scan it and see its power usage, components, status, and what type of ship it is.\n\nYou play as one of five roles, The Captain, The Pilot, The Weapons Specialist, The Engineer, and The Scientist.\nThe Captain is self-explanatory, they orders the crew around, and is in charge of trading, diplomacy, that sort of stuff.\nThe Pilot is also obvious, they pilot the ship, evade, align the ship, and give weapons a clear shot.\nThe Weapons Specialist is usually controlling a massive super cannon, which is fires powerful lasers and missiles.\nThe Engineer keeps the ship cool while at the same time giving everyone else enough power to work with.\nThe Scientist will perform research, cyber warfare, scanning, and is generally the go to guy for getting to know what's going on.\n\nYou explore though space, teleporting onto stations, exploring planets, and trying to find the Lost Colony.\n\nThe website probably explains it better than so here Link to website[www.pulsarthegame.com]\n\n\n\n\ntl;dr version: Starship simulator when those buttons actually have a purpose.","September 15, 2015","true","67.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The whole idea and concept is honest just a dream game if you want to be running LANs or just want a good game for you and the buds!\nThe basic idea is this, You and your friends are in charge of running a spaceship, so you'll need a pilot, a weapon specialist, a scientist, an engineer and of course, a captain. then you just go exploring the depths of space! completing missions and the like!\n\nPROS:\nDecent multiplayer! didn't have much trouble connecting, making a server, and the server lag wasn't ever a problem.\nGameplay seems solid! the controls and weapons all seem to function well! the weapons aren't too exciting yet though.\nPilot and run your own spaceship with your friends! This all works awesome! the piloting controls, and the whole UI is great if you are changing things in the menus and various panels found throughout your craft.\nJobs are actually fun! the jobs are surprising all filled with interesting things to do at almost every moment of gameplay, no real down time or dull moments for anyone! though admittedly, Pilot and Engineer have the most to do, and the most responsibility.\nGo to planets! You can actually go to a variety of planets and fight monsters, aliens, robots or the general populace for the loot found about the place!\nYou can level up and upgrade your character! You can actually pick from a decent selection of perks that improve your job efficiency, and get a variety of armours and weapons along the way!\n\nCONS:\nShooting isn't so great yet: With the exception of spaceship shooting, the FPS gameplay is weak, but functional. with work, this will be much better in time I imagine!\nPlanets can be dull: Some planets can be strange, or seem very.... glitchy. This part definitely feels the most unpolished, but I'm confident it will improve with time.\nNavigation can be awkward: Too often we got a mission at a such-n-such location, and we had no clue how to get there. I think some work needs to be done in this area.\nProgression is Minimal: The character progression is fine, but the ship progression seems non-existent. to my knowledge, you cannot upgrade your ship to another ship, merely attach upgrades to certain parts of the ship. This is all well and good, but once you start making coin, it would be cool to be able to buy a new spacecraft to use in game.\n\nTHINGS THEY SHOULD INCLUDE IN THIS (AWESOME) GAME\n-Campaign Mode: A full story to experience with your friends spanning a good 6 hours or so! with firefights, exploration, science stuff, and diplomacy! I would love that kind of experience, making the tough decisions as captain, putting controversial decisions to a vote for your crew, or possibly facing Reaper-ish foes! It would be fantastic!\n-Custom-Made Missions: This would fit into the campaign side of things, but A mission builder type of system would be awesome! You could make entire missions or campaigns to then play with friends or share online, with the option of including voiced dialogue and tree-style story elements!\n-Launchable Starfighters: It would be awesome if in the event of a large battle, a launchable craft could be made available to aid the mothership in violent incursions! This could also open the door to additional exploration options!\n\n\nIn closing, this game is freaking great! It is missing a little shine and polish, but is very reminiscent of the "Mount and Blade" series, which is definitely a good thing! just add a bit more scope, and some more cool doo-dads here and there, we have a true classic!","October 7, 2015","true","4.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

This game is a breath of fresh air, this game is exactly what the space Genre needs.  This game has the foundation of possibly the most accessable, but also DEEP space sim games I have played in decades.\n\nI am not going to lie, the game is a bit rough around the edges, the AI, the clunky animations, the tired generic models.  But even this sort of adds to the charm, it gives it a retro quality, and the simplicity of the interfaces make it instantly accessable!\n\nAt first the ugly nature of the graphics can be unsettling. However it all comes together in just the right way so that your imagination, and your interaction with your friends and the universe around you fills in the gaps, and smoothes the edges.  The game strikes the perfect balance of creating a sandbox with stuff to do, but letting your imagination fill in the gaps.\n\nWe picked a stealthy ship.  Thinking - hey, were newb, lets avoid trouble, and attack only when we have the advantage!  It took us a half hour or so to figure out the controls well enough to go to warp and not blow ourselves up.\n\nOn the first planet we discovered, We had to wear our space suits to walk around as it was a hot lava planet.  We ran a surface scan, and found 11 life forms.  It took a while but when we found them, it was funny as can be, we had no idea of the aliens would be friendly, or what.  I stood their, pointing my gun at them, asking my engineer for his advice, backing away as these lava slimes appraoched.  they didn't shoot or hurt lava or anything, so I decided to stand my ground.\n\nA split second later I was in agony, my health below 40%!  These aren't friendly aliens at all!  Open fire!\n\nMy engineer dutifully helped me slay all 11 of them, and we went on to explore the rest of the planet and got a few bits of loot for our trouble, including a nice new shield generator.\n\nIn another instance we spawned in and were attacked by an enemy ship, not an easy little drone like we had gotten used to so far, but a full power ship.  Thinking it would be a pushover, we engaged, the jolly roger unfurled!   Within seconds we learned (the hard way) how important the science officers role could be, as our upgraded and powerful shields vanished in the first volley!  We needed to modulate the shields and hit em with programs!\n\nOur ship was on fire!  And so my engineer friend dropped what he was doing and put out the fires. While I modulated the shields and tried to figure out what programs would help.  Whatever I Was doing it helped, the enemy's shots stopped destroying our shields, and our shots started penetrating.\n\nThe battle was white knuckle, with our systems overheating and exhausted, we lost main engine power, and sat toe to toe trading blows.  When it was over, we won by the skin of our teeth, our ship was below 20% hull, almost no armor left... Our ship was full of holes, and we limped to Sector Zero (the main outpost space station with NPC's you can talk to, to get repairs.\n\nIt took me a minute to figure out how to drop the shields to get repaired, but it was nice to be fully repaired and ready to go.  Plus we had some missions to do next time we play!\n\nIf you have even the slightest bit of love for the captains chair, science officers station, running the guts of a starship, piloting it, or working the guns,  you owe it to yourself to at least give this game a try.  Return it if you don't like it!\n\nI simply cannot believe that this game isn't being watched as closely as it should be.\n\nTonight, I jumped in with a friend, he chose engineer, and I of course had to be captain.\n\nFrom the first moments to the last moments, we were laughing, arguing, cursing, sweating, and cheering.\n\nI didn't even mind the lack of a tutorial, figuring out the ship and controls wasn't too steep of a learning curve, indeed, learning to properly configure the AI was the hardest part, and if you play with real people you won't have that issue as much.\n\nI would say this game loses a lot of it's charm if you try to play it solo.  I would say play it with 2 people at a minimum the first time you try it, and one should be captain, and one should be pilot.  The captain should run all the stations, while the pilot pilots.  The captain can functionally operate every station, just not as well.  But it's enough that you can have fun and get things done.\n\nWith a full group, cooperating and having a good attitude, the game is a total utter gem.\n\nI can't wait to see the finished product with all the features complete and a universe full of sandbox content to explore...\n\nTRY THIS GAME!\n","January 31","true","32.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are space battles, there is boarding, there are away missions, and it is all very fun and addicting; especially if you happen to join a good crew.\n\nFor those worried about early access: the game is very stable, in 27 hours the only hiccup I've had is one disconnect. There are latency issues to be expected if you are in Europe and connecting to a game on the US west coast, but game breaking bugs are almost entirely non-existent. The game's core elements are completely in place and it does not leave you feeling like major aspects of the game are missing.\n\nThere is not currently a very high amount of content in the game. After a few planets and a few battles you will definitely get the sense that you have "Been there, done that",  but the rogue-like elements and the ever increasing difficulty of the enemies as your journey goes on will keep you wanting to see what's at the end of your next jump, or whats for sale at the shop over in sector 1751. There are currently a few missions available in the game from NPC's that can give your adventures a sense of purpose, but there is no real story as of the time of this review.\n\nThe price is definitely the biggest drawback to this game. In its current state it feels like something that would fit the $10-$15 price range. That being said: having made the $25 commitment, I have no regrets. If you are an impatient gamer who wants non-stop action this game is probably not for you. It is intense action followed by periods of discussing plans, or debating which piece of gear to buy next, etc... If you are easily bored this may be a problem.\n\nAnd if you find yourself on a desert world, don't listen to the guy who tells you to follow him out into the sands away from the rest of the crew.","January 17","true","29.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nthy/recommended/252870/","nthy","Nthy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nthy/","539 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is reminicent of FTL, but does plenty to differentiate itself from FTL.  It's in 3D and has 5 man online co-op featuring 5 unique roles: a Captain, a Scientist, an Engineer, a Pilot, and a Weapon's Specialist! Each role has it's own bonuses, a rudimentary skill tree, and different things to do such as steering the ship, hacking/scanning, manning turrets, fixing the ship or bossing people around.\n\nI've had some great moments in this game. As the engineer, there's nothing quite like pulling off Scotty like miracle work and saving the ship with last second engine repairs and then punching the button that jumps you all to safety. Similarly when there's a virus in the computer, rebooting the computer involves some Jurassic Park style flipping of big switches that always makes me chuckle to myself every time I see them! They're great. As the pilot I got to show off my piloting skills while gingerly easing the ship through the tight passages of an ancient wrecked structure and navigating around dangerous mines as we tried to salvage some loot. As the weapons specialist there was a moment when we bit off more than we could chew, with our ship blazing, and our weapons knocked offline I made a snap decision to board the enemy ship at the last second and managed to destroy their weapons, haulting incoming damage just long enough for my crewmates to jump the ship to safety. As the captain the first adventure was a blast, with me totally clueless but leading a crew of seasoned veterans, and they just rolled with it, bless them. It was a disaster, but everyone had fun. The scientist is the most underapreciated role, but they have their uses such as scanning for lifeforms and modulating shields. Although underappreciated, I take secret pleasure in joining a game as the scientist. I've heard rumours that there will be some form of scientific research added at a later date to flesh out the role a little more, and I do hope so.\n\nYou can do some similar things in Pulsar that you can do in FTL such as boarding enemy ships, targetting their subsystems, hacking, shutting off their oxygen (or your own), causing/putting out fires, shopping, and upgrading your ship. There are some things you can do in pulsar that you can't do in FTL such as beaming down to planets, visiting space stations, comandeering enemy ships. There are some really nice touches, such as when you grab cargo, that stuff starts appearing on cargo pads in your ship. So when your ship fills up with cargo, it literally does fill up with cargo. Really adds to the immersion.\n\nThe galaxy is open world which to me is a huge plus, so there's a lot of freedom to roam the galaxy as your captain pleases. The open world doesn't extend to planets, with surface areas being small areas around the teleporter pad, more akin to dungeons than planet surfaces. But they are certainly functional enough for their purpose.\n\nIf you're lookng for something to play at the weekends with friends then there is definitely a lot of fun to be found here. Get 4 friends wth you and hilarity ensues. It was watching a live steam of people playing this that made me instantly buy it!\n\nIf you're looking for an FTL-like game you can follow the development of and play occasionally when patches come out then this is a good buy. Judging from their past dev-videos, new content comes approximately on a monthly basis with bugfixes and tweaks more regularly. If you like the concept and are willing to support a dev on the potential of their game alone then you will probably not be disappointed, Personally, I played pulsar for 2 days solid, and stopped playing it, only because I don't want to play it to death at this early stage. I know there is still a lot of content needs to be added and so it's better to only dabble in it for now. So now I just play it for a bit when patches some out.  The base game is complete, and all the core mechanics have been fleshed out to where it's a fully fledged game. There is a large galaxy to explore and missions you can play through. All that is lacking is a decent variety of content to keep things interesting in the long run. To be sure if you're looking for something that you can play all day long, every day, and never run out of content, then this is not the game for you--at least not yet. But if you're looking for something to dabble in until the developer has a chance to flesh it out more then I heartilly recommend.\n\nAs with all Early Access games there's no guarentee it will ever be finished, So really it comes down to whether you're willing to support the developer on the merit of what they have right now and on the future potential. Keep in mind your idea of "fleshed out" might differ from the developers. I've been burned before, *cough* Elite Dangerous *cough*. But I still see it as worth the risk to support smaller devs such as this when they have something that really appeals to me. If you're not sure then check out youtube, or better yet wait till release and you'll know for sure.","September 18, 2015","true","29.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I know the graphics look quite dated and it is true. This is not a game where you can expect to have everything glorified like you see in most new games out on the market.\n\nIn a typical game you can start off pretty nice and relaxing at the controls and after a quick jump through space, your entire crew including yourself is thrown into a panic to man the guns and adjust power throughout the ship in order to ensure its survival.\n\nIf you are a fan of star trek or have ever wanted to be part of that crew, do yourself a favor and get this game!!!\nIf you enjoy coop games where everyone on the crew has a specific job to take care of, get this game.\n\nCons to this game:\n\n-dated graphics,\n-Some games will have too many chiefs and not enough indians which makes gameplay really not enjoyable.\n\nAll in all, find yourself a decent group of friends who are willing to teach you your job and let you at the controls no matter how often you may fail.

It aims to be a glorious mashup of Artemis: Spaceship Bridge Sim, FTL, Guns of Icarus, and Star Trek: Away Team, and while it is admittedly a little light on content at the moment, it does a great job of capturing the essential components and atmospheres of all these games.\n\nPlayers get to choose between four different ships to fly in, each with their own advantages and disadvantages, and five classes to play as: captain, pilot, weapons, engineering, and science, each with their own disticnt roles and RPG-style progression trees. At present, you start at The Hub, an expansive space station from which you can purchase items, weapons, and ship components, and also pick up various missions that drive progression in the game. Gameplay involves FTL-esque flight between randomized sectors, replete with derelict ships, crazed security bots, and enemy capital ships. There's also Away Team segments, where you can teleport down to nearby planets to fight the aliens de jour and search for your mission objectives. There are some neat metagame mechanics at work too: factions, reputation, and a Galactic Chaos system that ramps up the difficulty of enemies as you play. Apparently there are also some other surprises in store further out in the galaxy, but I haven't made it far enough out without getting vapourized to encounter them.\n\nAll in all, it's a super promising little title with great atmosphere and ambition that's just a little short on polish and content at time of writing, but is still a blast to play. Best played with friends! You can yell at each other to charge the warp core as you are torn apart by AI bots.\n\nOveral Verdict: Pre-Beard Riker -- full of potential, and just waiting to fill out into a space-age icon.","September 15, 2015","true","11.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

The classes are all well designed, though the Scientist and Engineer could do with a few more responsibilities. The ships and their class-related functions are easy to learn how to use - after my first "game" (30 minutes of gameplay, "Game Over," everyone left) I had mastered a role and learned quite a lot about another two. The enemies (generally) aren't over- or under-powered, unless there are more than about 3 of them, in which case one should leave. Quickly.\n\nOne of my largest problems was the character model quality. While it doesn't affect gameplay, I'm very fussy when it comes to graphics quality. Also, there could be a bit more variety in terms of the ships (not the components, the ships themselves).\n\nI do think that the price was a bit too high, however. Personally, I would have been more willing to pay around £15, rather than £18.99.

If the concept was in the hands of a more capable developer, this could have been a special game. I am not looking for this game to improve all that much. I would like to see another developer take the concept of this game and improve upon it with better graphics, controls, and better content. I also feel the price of this game is a little steep for what it offers.","February 23","false","33.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
