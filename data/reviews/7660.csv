I started playing the original X-COM when I was six and almost instantly fell in love with it, however, with this game It has so much more content (and even more planned). The thing is, I absolutely love this game, it is likely my favorite of all time, the only one competing with it is the original X-COM. If anyone from Firaxis sees this review, create a poll on your X-COM forums and ask about how many would like to see a remake (or even a HD remastering while adding the features planned for it) for X-COM Apocalypse, I promise you, it is worth a financial investment, as it will sell like hot-cakes. This is one of those few games that is so good its just begging for a remaster.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/delance/recommended/7660/","delance","Delance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/delance/","926 products in account","Short version: This game is great. Buy it, play it.\n\nX-Com Apoc is a strange, but completely lovable creation. It's certainly an overly-ambitious game, and not all of its features were fully implemented. But it's not broken.\n\nThe cityscape is, like fans observe, a working ant-farm. Organizations raid each other, they raid you, you raid them. Aliens are a big part of the game by they are not your only enemy.\n\nPolitical and military decisions directly impact on the game and on the environment. If you are at odds with certain groups, there will be consequences. Some are obvious, like not being able to buy equipments from them. Some are more subtle. If you make an enemy of the corporation that runs the public transport system, your new recruits won't be able to reach your base. How great is that?\n\nForget about the limitations of the (surely great) new X-Com: you can have multiple bases, and stack them with troops and vehicles. You'll need them. Each real estate to build a base have a different price tag and different spacing accommodations. As always, you'll have to choose wisely.\n\nThis games feature a very advanced version of the turn-based game mode of the classic X-Com. If you want a good turn-based experience, this game does that.\n\nBut the real gem, in my opinion, is the real time combat engine. It's simply fantastic. It's every bit as tactical as the classic turn based, but with refinements and even limited responses from the units. They will not dumbly stick around under fire, but will, while respecting their orders, move in and out of cover to fire. They will behave like actual soldiers would, panic including. You can pause at any time to issue commands, and you can also create groups.\n\nIt's a sophisticated tactical real time engine that - make no mistake - have little to do with traditional RTS games. It's a real joy to blast aliens and enemies like that. The missions are more fluid, as well. This game feature some huge maps that are a core to go through on TB but are almost a breeze on RT.\n\nThe cityscape interception combat is fully realized on this game, and you can have huge air battles between your craft and the aliens. Sometimes the local police may even help you.\n\nDifficulty is Adjustable. It can be set to easy, and on the hardest difficulty it can give any game a run for its money.\n\nThis game is a lot of fun, and I really recommend it.\n","March 8, 2014","true","73.0"," 62 of 63 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","62","63","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zackFanatic/recommended/7660/","zackFanatic","zackFanatic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zackFanatic/","82 products in account","X-COM: Apocalypse is certainly the best XCOM game to start with if you are new to the franchise. Earlier XCOMs are doubly confusing, (though Apocalypse is still just as strange to a new player), but this entry eases that pain. With less aliens to deal with, a concentrated area to defend, and an interesting array of human enemies to fight, there are many pluses as to why Apocalypse is a great title. This is why I enjoyed it so damn much.\n\n-Internal intrigue amongst the human factions in the city are so, so fun. Building relationships with arms dealers, police, service providers and infastructure moguls makes for a very different play through every single time. Really cracking down on the alien cult? Well their weapon providers won't like you much. Blowing up a Diablo gang block? The police may just pat you on the back. Having an organization supporting you makes things easier, but not much\n\n-Premade alien portals made stationing your defense just a little bit easier. Granted, further on the game your Hovercars are going to be taking a big alien ♥♥♥♥, so its a little stressful. You never truly know whats going to happen with alien assaults, and that does get a little bit annoying. I was taking out a UFO incursion, and a stray missile of mine took up an entire block. Needless to say, I had to deal with enemy Hovercars and UFOs (though it was humerous when a UFO destroyed the enemy fleet!).\n\n-Actual alien incursions are fun, challenging, and very thrilling. Searching for your opponents in giant Hab blocks, shopping malls, and warehouses makes for an exciting chase, and once you get down to the firefight, a brutal battle ensues. What makes XCOM: Apocalypse so unique is its combination of face-paced turns, and really amazing physics (especially for the time). Other similiar titles, like Jagged Alliance 2 and Fallout, don't have gigantic, map changing explosions, massive destruction, and just so much death. Its also very balanced. Like the former two references, you can't take on a huge alien incursion with just 4 guys unless you really plan your ♥♥♥♥ out, while in JA2, if you have 4 high level Mercs, you can take out entire bases. Expect a challenge!\n\n-Tech development and organization managment is really fun. Equipining and specializing your operatives makes for some fun team ups. I personally never tried PSI, but I do love putting heavy weapons on my androids. Nothing says 'burnt as ♥♥♥♥ alien' then an Android firing incendiary with his Megapol Autocannon! Different armours, jump packs, stun guns, and other fun items leaves for interesting tactical situations. You can take aliens alive to study, capture alien weapons, or just Duke Nukem everything not human. Vehicles are varied, with all sorts of different armaments, and can be equiped for many different roles. I like to have a hovercar with heavy anti-structure weaponry, just to give a big 'Screw you' to any cults that may try to attack my base.\n\nIn closing, XCOM is a great strategy game for a moderately experienced player who enjoys turn based games. It is challenging, but rewarding, and the memories I've had with this game are truly remarkable. A must buy for any fan of JA2, the Fallouts, or even more conventional RTS fans looking to branch out.","July 16, 2014","true","109.0"," 41 of 43 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","41","43","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/esloman/recommended/7660/","esloman","ESloman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/esloman/","227 products in account","This is more of a recommendation to buy it on Steam rather than an actual review of the game itself.\n\nI was first introduced to this game as a kid and I spent many many hours playing it. However I probably didn't full understand the mechanics and I did eventually manage to complete it (the difficulty was on novice...). I have returned to this game many times in the last decade or so and more recently had difficulty to the operating systems no longer being compatible. I tried again when the latest X-COM game came out and used DosBox to get it to work. However, last week when I had an urge to replay it I couldn't remember for the life of me how I got it working or it wasn't working now. I did stumble upon it on Steam and bought it immediately. For the price of a couple of quid it's a bargain really! I've invested over 40 hours in the last week because it has to be one of my full time games.\n\nOn Steam, it's quick and easy to get running with no fussing around with DosBox and whatever. Steam does that all for you! The only complaint is that some PCs may get a funny resolution when running full screen but that is easily fixed. There's also the issue that if you tab out and then back in again, the game will default to a much smaller size (due to the game's orignal resolution). The final issue, and the more pressing one, is that the game tends to crash a lot with the error "Please insert X-COM disk". This is a common error and a simple fix is to save regulary (I do anyway so it wasn't an issue for me!) to return to points moments before the game crashes. The disk error always happens when the game has to load something so I make sure I always save before having to force the game to load a different part. A quick google reveals that many people have come up with a solution to this and if you have the time (I don't cos I have more X-COM to play!) you can easily fix all the above mentionned issues. So really, if you love this game and haven't already got it working, then I'd buy it if I was you!","January 12, 2014","true","249.7"," 36 of 37 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","36","37","0","0"

It works well and gives the same experience as when I played it when it first came out. The challenge with the game is that it runs in DOSBOX, which starts giving errors once you start expanding your bases and having large numbers of units. You then start experiencing what looks like memory errors in DOSBOX, which makes the game unplayable. The STEAM support option advises that you go to http://support.2kgames.com which for some reason does not exist or open on my PC.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/7660/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nX-COM: Apocalypse was developed by MicroProse and released in 1997. X-COM: Apocalypse plays very much like the previous installments, however Apocalypse boasted a real-time combat mode, and a 3d city viewing mode, in addition to old features within the series.\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: X-COM: Apocalypse follows the chronology half a century after the end of X-COM Terror from the deep. Possible spoiler: After the events in X-COM: Terror from the Deep, a worldwide environmental cataclysm destroyed the ecosystem forcing everyone into Bio-domed cities. X-COM: Apocalypse takes place in the city “Mega-Primus”, which is built over the ruins of Toronto Canada.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=529183940\n\nGameplay: I should quickly point out for the causal reader: I never actually played these games growing up, so I'm reviewing these games as a newcomer (I always told friends “I could play games with minimal graphics” and I genuinely have enjoyed the X-COM games thus far. If my hours are low, it's because I plan to play more on my laptop when traveling)\nX-COM: Apocalypse takes “UFO Defense” and “Terror from the Deep” and builds on that foundation to make a newer better and more UI friendly game. You would be amazed how big a difference hovering your mouse cursor over an icon and seeing a tool tip, makes for the player.\nWhereas to start playing the previous two X-COM games you need to do one of two things: Find a PDF Manual online, or watch/read tutorials and introduction strategies. There were no tool tips, no tutorial, and hardly any substantial 'beginner's help' within the games themselves.\n\nMap Mode: So you get a 3D over-world map that lets you see Mega-Primus, and there's also a 2D Map version of the city. While playing I made note that I had a much easier time looking at the map in 2d mode.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=529178505\nI have a sneaking suspicion that the 3D representation, was partially caused by pressure from other 3D games being released into the market in 1996 and 1997. (To list some of the best sellers: Civilization II, Warcraft II, Diablo, and Final Fantasy VII.)\nWhile in Map mode you will micromanage your troops, watch for Alien invasion, build new bases, manage vehicles, and much more.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=529181726\n\nCombat Mode: There are now two combat modes; the standard turn-based mode that the X-COM player base experienced in the first two games, and a brand-spanking new RTS (Real-Time Strategy).\n\nThere are many other features that I don't have space to explain in my review, many of the core concepts are the same but have a different user interface, basically the whole game received a face-lift.\n\nAchievements:There are no achievements linked to X-COM Apocalypse, however playing and beating games like these are an achievement in their own right.\n\nImprove performance I'm adding this section to this review because your experience with the game will improve if you make a slight modification to the dosbox.conf file, change "output=surface" to "output=ddraw" or “output=opengl”.\nThere are many references to this change in games that implement dosbox, I would give credit to those posts but there are to many to reference. Making this small change will fix many graphical problems with dosbox games, but you need to do it to each dosbox game individually and every time you re install.\n\nPrice: X-COM: Apocalypse is priced at $4.99. If you already know you like games like these I suggest picking up the X-COM: Complete Pack for $14.99. I purchased my copy from Humblebundle.com.\n\nConclusion: Hopefully I've been able to do this game justice. The Classic X-COM Series has impressed me every time I've played it. It boggles my mind that MicroProse was able to put so much detail into these games, the detail even rivals strategy games released today.\nWhile the graphics might be difficult and turn away many from the game; if you can overcome that (or simply don't care about it, like me.) you will discover the gem in the strategy game genre which is the X-COM series.\nThank you for reading my review, I approve this series, and recommend it to strategy game enthusiasts, nostalgic gamers, and X-COM operatives.\n\nRelated Reviews\nHere's the URL to see my review for X-COM: UFO Defense\nHere's the URL to see my review for X-COM: Terror From the Deep","October 10, 2015","true","4.9"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","27","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/7660/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","XCom Apocalypse is my favorite of all XCom titles, old and new. And - no, not because of nostalgia.\n\nWhile I'm certainly cherish the challenge of the first two XCom games, and enjoying the tactical shootouts of the newer ones... By the terms of complexity of the gameplay, Apocalypse still has no rival. Well, maybe the first Banner Saga has something common in terms of complexity - but it's another setting and totally another scale of events.\n\nIf you're still wandering, what I'm talking about - it's all of the game economics, your actions and their consequences. Yeah, the things I hate in the new XCom games for their inaptitude.\n\nIn Apocalypse, you can hire enough soldiers and buy enough venicles to get any unfriendly down. You'll be provided with almost sufficient amount of bright heads for your R'n'D as fast as you want - and without need to wait until someone in the "counsel" decide to throw a bone to you... But, of course, the price is there too. And that price has a name - Responsibility.\n\nYou can brake down all the structures in the city block, on some mission while hunting invading aliens... and then it turns out that those buildings were belonging to your main ammunition supplier... not anymore. Or you can raid a local gang hideout, take all their stuff and then sell it on the market... drugs in the first place. And then the Megapol will be asking you questions, and remnants of that gang - asking for your blood. Or you can produce some guns, then sell them on the market - to drop down all guns prices - and goodwill of other marketeers towards you as well.\n\nAlmost every organization in Megacity (except for politicians) is vital for the city well-being, so, while you don't have to be really nice with everybody, once you'll turn any of them down to aliens, or simply make them your enemies - you'll do yourself a great problem. In the Enemy Unknown, for example, sometimes it is even beneficial to lose a country or two - you'll faster take some perks for controlling all continent... In the Apocalypse Megapolis, every corporation is invaluable, when it is on your side, and very dangerous, as an enemy.\n\nWith all that - no doubt, XCom Apocalypse is a very old game, from the time when even Win95 was uncommon. Some basic gameplay features that works everywhere now, such as tutorial, or underdog difficulty level... aren't applied. Visuals, and the need to tune DosBox, out of any doubt, will turn down the most part of the modern players.\n\nBut if you'll look past this, you'll find the XCom being a powerful organisation, with the great capabilities and responsibilities as well. You can send helluva of tanks and rocketeers to meet alien invaders with the ocean of fire... and pay dearly for all shambles you'll make to the city property. As of overall expression, it's like switching from the nowadays Bundeswehr or British Army to the Soviet one. Or changing your BB-gun with .308 barelled rifle. Sure, even the Soviets were not all-powerful. But who's got the better chances to bring down the invasion, and return fire into enemy lair? Same scale goes with the rifles analogy.\n\nMy mark is 8/10. Game's quite outdated, and even at start had some flaws, due to the limited development time and pressure from publisher. Yet so far we're still out of better options, despite all the years passed.","May 3","true","130.1"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","23","25","2","0"

It's really different from the original UFO Defense and Terror from the Deep games, but yet, it is still classic in its's own way and for me, it will always be the part of the original X-Com series. The graphics may look odd at the first glance, but this game has really nice and deep atmosphere, great creepy music and the overall feeling, that you are just a weak group against something really powerfull and there's danger anywhere all the time.\n\nInstead of whole Earth, your goal is to protect a single city. But it is a hard task indeed. I especially love the base and soldiers management as well as all the different corporations working/hating/fighting with each other and that you can have different relations with them every single gameplay.\n\nResearch/manufacturing is also really nice and helps in keeping you excited to move forward. The aerial combat is pretty neat as well and one of my favorite feature tbh. It's the first game (and only one basically) in the X-COM strategy brand, where you can personally affect the result of air battles yourself. You can command your crafts and fighters, tell them, how agrresive they should be or how low or high they should fly and engage targets. Sometimes, specially late-game, after a battle with huge alien motherships, you realize that you just demolished half of the city, which is epic, but gives you a lot of negative backlash from the corporations owning the buildings as well.\n\nThe ground combat, or the classic terror and UFOs missions are ok. It had its flaws back then already when it came out and in comparison with modern games it's even more obvious now. But it's nothng that would prevent you from finishing the game.\n\nStorywise, I found that the game was quite lacking by its end and the last missions were really stereotypical and mostly boring. The start of the game till mid-game was the most exciting part for me. And trust me, that it's well worth it.\n\nSoo, in sum.. If you liked the original games, get this game ASAP and play it. Hopefully, you will like it too. Has it's flaws maybe, but it's still oldschool X-COM piece and much better than most recent crap games.","October 15, 2014","true","26.9"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

I purchased this game 3 times, on release, 2 years later after I had to install it on a new PC and the original disk was broke and then on Steam, just for having it. This ranks amongst my all-time favorites and is in my eyes the best title of the franchise.\n\nWhat makes it so great? Never has tactical combat been deeper and never had a game a greater range on tactical approaches and significant shifts of how you play over the course of its campaign. There is a technology life-cycle here that will keep the game fresh, whenever the aliens show up bringing new toys, you have to adapt quickly, research if your survive to stay on technological eye-level with your foes until the next cycle. This is the basic principle of all X-Com games, but here are much more of these technology cycles and their impact is much greater.\n\nSpeaking about impact, the environments are completely destructible and you can literally bring down whole buildings in the tactical missions, as well as in the strategic city view instead of hunting the aliens one by one. But you might ♥♥♥♥ of the owners that are funding your operation. If they are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of already, then why not raid their building for resources, even if there are no aliens involved, yes you can even do that. The feature depth out of combat is massive, you only have a city as playing field, but every building has an owner and every misguided missile during an interception attempt has a political impact. You can buy buildings, station vehicles and agents all over the place, raid and attack organizations. Research and Development as well as budget management are complex, but easily learnable and even when you are in tight spot, the game has desperate measures available to turn things around.\n\nSure, the graphics where not that god, even at release, the optional real-time mode is not much more than a gimmick (quite useful when you are confidently overpowered to accelerate things) but it is not hard to appreciate the “inner-beauty” of the gameplay once you get into it. All the other franchise trademarks like customizable soldiers, inventory management and UFO base building are at their feature-filled best.\n\nI played most tactic games since the good old DOS days, from Ufo Defense over Jagged Alliance, Fallout over titles like Silent Storm up to last year’s great XCOM – Enemy Unknown. But none ever could compete to X-COM Apocalypse, if you have the slightest interest in the genre, you absolutely owe it yourself to play this! If Firaxis is working on a sequel to their re-imagination, I wish they would go to Apocalypse for inspiration. It might be too complex for today’s streamlined standards, but it gets so much depth out of this complexity, that keeps it interesting even after all these years.\n\nPros:\n- true tactical depth\n- strategically complex\n- all franchise tropes in effect\n- fierce technology lifecycles\n\nCons:\n- complexity requires ramp-up time\n- boring graphics\n","January 1, 2015","true","0.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

Situation includes gangs which are constantly pressing the local police, a new radical cult which has risen in wake of the dimensional warp, and a class separation between humans, hybrids, and androids which has reached unprecedented levels. On top of this, our supporters are becoming increasingly weary of our ability to maintain control. Keep these factors in mind as you venture out in your mission to bring peace to Mega-Primus.\nAs head of X-COM, a facility with staff and equipment are at your disposal in order to determine the origins and nature of the alien threat. We have allocated both science and engineering assets, as well as a fully equipped security detachment with ground and air capabilities. There are a few vacancies in town should you require additional real estate to better manage the organization.\nThe aliens wield technologies never seen before - weapons, interdimensional craft, shield and cloaking devices - acquiring these artifacts and reverse engineering them for military implemention should be your top priority. Until our forces and technology are comparable to the interdimensional beings, we have little chance of keeping the intruders at bay. Local markets will also benefit from technological advancement, just watch that your discoveries do not fall into the wrong hands.\nTake advantage of your surroundings. Drawing from the Hybrid and Android populations, as well as your human counterparts, will prove vital to success on the ground. Alliances with the police, transit companies, and military suppliers will also be important to logistics. It's up to you, how to contend with the gangs, but definitely leverage your position to quench the cult's illegal activities.\nWith proper asset management, resource implementation, and mission execution in the air and on the ground, we believe you have everything you need to disrupt the malicious activity converging in our beloved city.

In this game you control units and craft to destroy impending aliens, and as you go along you will get, better weapons/more ammo, access to disruptor and toxin technology, more agents and more money. However, the aliens get more advanced week after week, and you will commonly find disruptor guns at week 2, harder and harsher UFO's almost every week, new units and will sometimes attack buildings. In the "Overworld" you fight alien craft and have access to the different menus (Other than the main in-game menu). In the Tactical (ground combat) world you first have a debriefing (Tends to be the same) and the choice between Real-Time and Turn-Based combat. You control X-Com Agents in the field and go hunting for the aliens, but be careful! If you put too many in one place to hunt you might find yourself in a LOT of trouble. Hence were waiting come in handy. You want to pick off as many aliens as possible (UFO Crash landings bring out the most of this) before sending your units into the darkness to find the aliens There are different ranks for each agent, from rookie to commander and to get said ranks you must fight in Tactical. The game has its fair share of bugs.\nSummary: a very strategic and fun game. 9.6/10","February 6","true","370.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Clocked enormous numbers of hours on it. About the only game that I exceeded hours on at the time was Civ 2 (or was it 3?). Anyway, despite its age is still one of the best squad games ever made (imo). Yes the squad control and grid system was a bit clunky, but by damn did it make you think about how you deployed your squads. Do I assign all the green troops to one squad or should I space out my veterans to improve all round fire? Should I equip explosives? How much can I afford to load down my troops? How much extra ammo should I give them? More importantly can I afford all that?\n\nEvery aspect of the game is intricately made. Even the dated aerial combat mode has its own charm. Yes the aliens are a bit cartoony but there's nothing more terrifying than watching your hard spent cash go up in smoke when a flying alien shoots acid at your troops and their armour melts.\n\nThe best aspect of this game has to be the map randomiser. No two maps you play will ever be the same. Where you are deployed at the beginning, the type of base you have, how to manage your finances, how to keep the other city corporations happy, picking the ones you can afford to raid, all of that makes for one of the most immersive tactical games I've ever played.

As such it builds on the model developed in previous Xcom games by playing similar to Xcom1, but, expanding strategic elements into the political realm: individual factions in the game can be raided and searched, destroyed, or made into enemies. This makes the game resemble Tropico (despite pre-dating Tropico) rather than an Xcom game.\n\nMost of the usual Xcom features are there: tactical and strategic combat will strike the player as familiar. What is new is the real time mode (which can be switched to turn based) during tactical missions. The setting is also different: a single large city is now where the campaign takes place and it can be randomized by difficulty.\n\nOthers may harumph these new features, but, this author thinks that the developers have done a very fine job of modernizing Xcom and making the game extremeley solid.

Simply great overall. Why? Well you can have 24 man squads, your vehicles are entirely customisable and your troops are truly something else come the end of the game. Playing in the real time mode you can dual wield and fire sniper rifles simultaneously, brap! brap!, the alien laser cannons, zap! zap!, or even plasma swords, zhoom! zhoom!. Ivan mechanics.\n\nEverything is destructible and important people own those buildings, whether your vehicle misses a UFO with your HE Missile and levels a corporate headquarters or your rookie with AP/HE rounds triggers a nuclear chain reaction of fuel vats in combat, someone expects you to pay for damages. If those guys get angry enough at you then they wont provide services to you. Almost every corporation has a purpose, if the delivery guys hate you enough then you will literally have to send your own vehicles to collect items and personnel from distributors (even the football guys effect your available recruits) so angering anyone except the cult&criminals is ill advised.\n\nAdd in that your base can get invaded by anyone (even those angry corporations), you can invade the general public's bases and that you can eventually invade the alien dimension itself is a fantastic freedom. You can also send your XCOMs into any building to check it for aliens, if there's none the owner will get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ but if you pay attention you can really crack down on the invasion as you will not get alerts for most intrusions.\n\nI haven't a clue about the turn based mode, so I can't say much for that, but the game is perfectly balanced on real time mode and aptly difficult on hard and above. It's a shame there's no real support in modding for this XCOM as it really is the most intelligent and progressive out of them all. The only real downside is the dated graphics.\n\nIf do you buy the game, search "steam xcom apoc no cd fix" though, as steam have not set it up quite correctly for use with DOSbox.","December 2, 2014","true","140.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Even though it's not quite like X-Com 1 and 2, I still felt the fun of researching the weird new aliens and tech deployed against me.\n\nA warning for someone who is new to the game - there is no tutorial. There is no hand-holding. It is not user-friendly, and you will likely be lost and overwhelmed. Back when I first played it I had no instruction manual, so I didn't even know how to put your men on the ship (tip: drag and drop the soldier portraits onto the ship when you deploy your craft), so for a long time I left the game alone until one day I forced myself to sit down and figure it out.\n\nFor the most part the game runs as intended on Win 7, but after a while, I invariably get an error that says to "input the cd". At that point, the only thing I can do is hit Ctrl+F9 to exit the program and then fire it up again. It starts as a minor inconvenience, but once you start saving and loading your game a lot, you'll see this error pop up significantly more often.","October 3, 2012","true","30.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm a big fan of the pausable real-time missions and aerial combat, combined with the capture and research mechanic from the original XCOM. I also quite like the interaction with different organisations to purchase goods, and the 'alien influence' system which can subvert organisations if you don't respond to incursions quickly enough.\n\nFor fans of the original X-COM, this game may be lacking in some ways -- being confined to a single city, rather than global in scope, and being perhaps not quite as scary as UFO and TFTD were -- although the sound of a previously-unnoticed brainsucker leaping at one of your troops is still pretty frightening. I think it definitely does maintain the "uhoh, where are they hiding?" feeling that the older XCOM games had.\n\nOn the whole, I would certainly recommend this for anyone who likes games in the style of X-COM; especially so for those who liked UFO but found the turn-based combat somewhat annoying.

Not really an X-COM 3 (i.e. true spiritual successor to XCOM: UFO Defence, or XCOM: TftD), but it was similer enough to still be interesting.  While I found UFO: Extraterrestials to be a much better "XCOM 3" game, and don't really see the new XCOM: Enemy Unknown as a true successor either, it was still fun for what it was - kinda more cyberpunky (flavoured a bit like Syndicate was) than the original two XCOM games.  I liked the idea of alien hybrids being the ones with the best psychic powers, and androids instead of tanks on missions - but many different kinds of land and air interceptors to use when shooting UFOs down.

A sheer classic to a wonderful series, this game provides everything needed for Strategy junkies to keep you playing for hours.\n\nIt mixes Micro & Management well in a world where Diplomacy is also key to surviving the Alien threat. Need more funding? Ally yourself with the political parties. Need more Medkits? Ally yourself with the local medical organisation. Need more scientists? Ally yourself with the local biomedical organisations.\n\nThe combat feels alot more personal in this game, you fight the UFO's over a city Geoscape rather than a planet wide attack, the UFO attacks have potential to affect every organisation in the game and can indirectly affect their influence towards you. If one of your stray rockets unintentionally hits a criminal organisations building, they will become hostile and may plan on raiding your HQ if you don't smooth things over.\n\nThe game also introduces Real Time combat into the tactical based missions. So if anyone isn't a particular fan of turn based games the game allows you the option to experience in Real Time.\n\nThe game allows you to set your own pace, unlike the more recent Enemy Unknown/Within, you don't feel as rushed playing Apocalypse, allowing you to enjoy the journey of the game to it's fullest.","December 10, 2011","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Battle UFOs in real-time above the city with your customized fleet of ground and air based interception vehicles, and respond to alien sightings by deploying an APC full of your big-name Hollywood marine corps heroes who are as expendable as their cheesy one-liners. When your APC arrives at target building, you assume command of your sqaud in a variety of large fully destructible isometric 3D settings ranging from a 6 story apartment block with anti-gravity elevators, to a flying car manufacturing plant, to the police headquarters. Are the aliens holed up in a choke point with only one entrance? Use your best Schwarzenegger "HERE, TRY MINE!" impersonation and blow a hole in a wall for an improvised entrance! Or use heavy explosive devices to knock out enough supporting columns of the structure and bring the whole ♥♥♥♥in building down on their heads, jihad style. Keep in mind that excessive property destruction will anger the faction who owned the building, who may demand financial compensation, or declare outright war on your forces!

Right off the bat the base management and overworld spaceship battles above the city came back to me. The best part though, is the fear that I still feel as I send my squads into mysterious combat situations when Xeno's have been spotted.

And the artstyle is pretty ugly. But, its such a fun game.\n\nBasically you set up a base in the city, most preferably in a warehouse, if you don't want to learn why slums make a very bad base the hard way.\nThey added many different vehicles, that can shoot at anything you want in the city, so you can blow up buildings from factions you don't like, and they even loose money for that :D You can make an entire building collapse, even in a battle ! You can equip your vehicle with various parts, you can get attacked by other factions both humans and aliens, you can attack any other human factions you want and later on aliens as well, you have to do diplomacy with other human factions, and etc.. This game is really deep and complex.\n\nAnd finally, the game runs both in realtime with time controls ( play, pause, forward, fast forward, and really fast ), and turn by turn. You can choose before each battles what mode you want to use.","November 3, 2012","true","160.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is something else and unique, the basic framework is there and the potential for a great tactical X-Com style game but it was not critically acclaimed as it's predecessors. So, is this game bad then?\n\nNot by any means. You could call Apocalypse a somewhat dated and unpolished, graphics look extremely odd. The interface is not that well thought out, micromanagement can be a hassle and the map can be quite useless. Basically it is not very user friendly on the first glance. There are other minor things that might annoy you but once you get past that, you will find a very refreshing game.\n\nThe unique concept and draw of this game is the huge city that you have to defend against alien forces. You manage a specialized organisation and need to trace any sign of alien activity, research them, capture them and even fight off huge invasions, be it on the ground or airborne. The city has it's own intricacies like the many factions or economy. The city is filled with various factions and corporations and your relationship with them might change the prices of some goods. Factions fight against eachother in this turmoil and your job is to keep the city alive and defend against the impending alien threat. It all feels very interactive and alive compared to other games.\n\nYour duty is to manage the base, personal and equipement of your organisation. Fight, research and engineer your way to victory. Most of the time will be spent in the tactical ground battles against aliens or in the city screen while trying to fight off ufos. Battles can be very intense due to the high difficulty and tactical options.\n\nThere is much to talk about but I recommend this game for anyone who likes the concept of X-com with a unique twist, it just needs some time to get used to due to the somewhat unfriendly user interface and dated graphics.\n\n","January 6, 2015","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love it pure and simple, not because I have a long history with this game but that fact that this is the game that went somewhere that non-hardcore turn based fans could love themselves.\n\nI have been playing this game for at least 5 years of my life, and every time I play this game I learn something new (even today). If its the AI's tactical approch of you if thats hiding and waiting for a opening behind cover to kill you, or running in balls'a'glory on your ♥♥♥ to see if you can take it (half the time you will lose half your troops). Also another thing that made me laugh about this game is that if your powerful enough you will make the biggest ship in the game run away from you, not in the portal they came from, oh no that would be to hard with my own alien tech for them but they will run outside of the city to the wastelands where they will die without your help.\n\nBesides being the awesome alien killer I am, I can recommend this game to anyone that wants a challenge away from other sci-fi games out there (even away from the other older X-COM games).\n\nSo all together this is on my top 10 sci-fi games, so its a 8/10 for what it is and always will be.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mangered/recommended/7660/","mangered","ToXeye","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mangered/","258 products in account","At times disappointing, this game has given a lot of graphics and gameplay. I have seen it now, so I don't want to play it much more, but I can recommend this game to anyone who's interested in games like X-COM. It is PRETTY OUTDATED and it doesn't let you win the game, but it gives some fun mechanics to ponder about. Rather than being a 100% playable game, it is 95% playable. Most of the time will be put into researching the aliens, so since I've already played this game once I don't find it that appealing to play it again. But the aliens are somewhat interesting and provide a lot of gameplay.\n\nA lot of the time is spent trying to get the Marsec plane. As usual, the aliens have huge ships that are hard to shoot down. The time spent raiding the alien cult is ridiculous, since that's one of the only ways of getting infinite cash aside from using a cheat. Then there's the ridiculous bikes. Why ride a bike when you can take an APC? The bikes are only good for raiding the alien cult for money. They were SUPPOSED to be part of a game where you have a lot of political intrigue, but they trashed that idea and just went for the basic X-COM style. There's little that has been done with the political system so you can basically bribe or raid. And you can only play the X-COM faction so there's little insight into the other factions. But the levels are designed well, so you get a lot of gameplay just by killing aliens that zap down into buildings.\n\nAnd then there's the aspect of capturing live aliens, as usual, and it's what the game was about I guess. Not the political system. Sadly, I think most games suffer from things like that - lack of time to complete. Otherwise, this game could very well have things like pacts done with other factions that actually lead to some benefit rather than just being bribed from disliking you. For example, bribing Marsec could bring in extra Marsec ships. Bribing Megapol could sponsor them having larger ships helping you out (rather than just the basic police cars). But I guess a lot of things are in the game so I am just complaining because I already finished playing this game.\n\nI hope I didn't spoil anything or destroyed the image of the game. It is basically a metropolis defense game, in short expressions. It has some futuristic things but mostly it's just an X-COM followup. It has old stuff from older games in it, like from Laser Squad. It has the X-COM gameplay. Complexity makes this game a bit charming, since you can damage other factions which means that you have to pay them money to amend for the damage. At the same time, the complexity means that a ship easily blows up a building by mistake. And the redundancy of certain things makes this game worth remembering just because of how silly it is to have those things. For example the ground vehicles are completely useless. The flying jet bike can shoot plasma and the ground bike is useless.\n\nThe reason I want to review this game is that I am bored of most games lately. This is a classic, and it offers a lot. I just can't play it anymore. I think it's just that games don't renew themselves. After doing something in a game it becomes "just doing" and then you could just stop playing and not care. That's how I feel now, but the first time I played this game it was exciting to steal the alien technology (even though it is not as cool as that of the first game).\n\nNah.... I recommend this game just because it has some cool stuff like useless stuff that you can play around with. The bikes... they just let you take one (1) agent that has to carry all the loot himself. It is fun, but not essential to the gameplay. It does not improve how fast you finish the game (IF you finish the game, because I think it's pretty hard to do that). The tank, it can shoot warheads but the only thing warheads are good for is if you want to destroy a building (which is pretty stupid). In short: A lot of features, very cramped gameplay. What if I wanted to shoot a warhead at a large alien ship? You will miss and hit a building and lose money. How about, instead, the warhead was guided and could hit the ship easily? Perfect, but then it wouldn't be as memorable how useless that thing is.\n\n\n\n","December 30, 2014","true","11.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Apocalypse changed it up a bit by adding a real-time-esque element, and setting the game in one city, rather than a global scale.\n\nWhile it is still a great strategy game, it is very difficult to play this game today when there exists the new X-COM games with modern day conveniences. If you've played this game before, it may still get a playthrough thanks to nostalgia. However, if you have never played this game before, it is doubtful that you will both understand how to play this game, nor find it worthwhile to actually play through it.\n\nWhile it may not really have stood the test of time to be playable to the masses, it is a title that will always be remembered by those who enjoyed it many years ago.\n\n4/10 "Not worth playing today"","January 26","false","0.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

Unfortunately, even armed with this knowledge, I cannot for the life of me beat even the very first level on novice difficulty.  You see, there are these little bug-like aliens that can move incredably far each turn and attack by leaping on to a solder's head and draining their brains which not only kills the solder, but actually turns him against you.  It seems to always work and I cannot devise a viable defense against it.  Like the remakes, there is an overwatch mode (sort of) called opportunity which allows you to hold off part of your turn in order to shoot the aliens on their turn.  In theory, one should be able to use it to intercept the brain suckers before they are able to do their thing.  In practice, your squad acts like a bunch of stormtroopers and miss every singe shot while destroying everything around the target, even at pont blank.  I know the X Com games are supposed to be difficult  but this is crazy.   Whoever decided that making the very first enemy an absolute squad killer (even on the lowest difficulty setting) should be taken out back and put down.\n\nI cannot recomend this game.  Unless you are a glutton for punishment that is.\n\nAlso, as the game progresses, there are several bugs that can make the game unplayable, so there is that to consider as well.","February 15","false","0.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","2"

The third game in the much-loved, often-abused X-COM series, Apocalypse begins with humanity victorious over the Martians and the Lovecraftian horrors alike, enjoying their awesome future technology in a not-quite-big-enough arcology on the last unpolluted patch of dirt left on planet Earth. A new alien menace, this one significantly buggier than the last, is invading, and while you no longer have to worry about the various nations of the world turning against your cause ('cuz they're all dead at this point lulz), the arcology is divided between multiple factions, all of which must be kept happy unless you want The Enemy to establish a foothold within your borders.\n\nGameplay is totally revamped from the first X-COMs. While there's still a turn-based combat mode, you can now play in real-time, shouting orders to your troops and having them rain hot plasma upon their enemies as a combined force. Meanwhile, shooting down enemy ships is no longer just a tiny minigame; now, you get to send out tanks, choppers, jets, hoverbikes, and all sorts of junk in-between to shoot down bogies. Scientists and engineers have unique stats rather than just being faceless commodities, and because your missions take place in faction-held terrain, missions tend to be a lot more personalized. In short, some really cool ideas were introduced to the series here, and I love the game for it.\n\nUnfortunately, the actual implementation of these cool ideas is universally terrible. The turn-based combat feels weird and unnatural, while the real-time is much harder than it'd otherwise be as you wind up wasting a lot of rounds shooting soon-to-be corpses. The anti-UFO combat is nearly game-breakingly buggy, as your tanks and planes often clip into the ground and die whenever terrain around them gets shot. I wound up clearing the game by relying entirely on a massive fleet of hoverbikes with plasma cannons attached, which is totally awesome but probably not an intended strategy.\n\nIf you're a fan of the series, it is possible to muddle through X-COM: Apocalypse, and you'll wind up with some good moments, but expect a lot of pain along the way. Also, Sid Meier, if you're reading this, PLEASE keep your X-COM remakes coming until you hit this point in the canon. Just put those Civilization games on the back-burner for a while; you've got to prioritize here, y'know?","January 9, 2014","false","0.1"," 14 of 35 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","14","35","0","0"

Bah, I've been trying a lot longer than that.  Steam doesn't track very well for this game...\n\n...and that's the problem.  I wanted to try this one, I really did.  It seemed so different from the other two that it was worth playing and learning, an RTS/cityscape adaptation of XCOM.  Sadly, it's also the most incompatible of the three, as the DOSBox runs sluggishly and I've yet to find a way to get it running.\n\nReally, 2k... for shame.  You can't release products like this, it's just wrong.  At least TftD worked through playing the Windows 95 version (ending explorer.exe, and that didn't fix the audio stuttering), and UFO Defense has the amazing OpenXCOM Mod.  This, though?  It runs worse than the other two, and getting it to run seems like a hopeless case.\n\nLuckily, it seems that our favorite modders are at it again.

You are supposed to gather items and cause minimal damage to your surroundings when you fight the enemy, but you can't do that. All the aliens gather up on each other and die in the same area, letting their weaponry pile up. And then This. One. Alien. will throw a grenade at you, at himself, or at nothing.

Also economy makes more sense, because suppliers have limited amount of goods, etc.\nAnd it is good to mention, that the new Enemy Unknown is a good game too, but very different, because it has lined up missions. These old games are more like a sandbox where you have war with aliens. Your success and progress depends on your research and skill during combat.\nIt took me 44 hours to win on normal difficulty, which is a very good result in comparison with new Enemy Unknown and even older Ufo Defense (16 hours) and Terror from the Deep (31 hours). And I must say I enjoyed every moment, it is very well balanced, mid-game is the most difficult part. After getting devastator cannon and personal shields, it gets easier and then with toxiguns it is a straight way to win. But still, last 10 missions almost always took me 40-60 minutes to finish.\nPS: save often and always before going on a mission. Sometimes the game asks for CD during mission loading and the only solution is to close the game and load saved position.","March 20, 2015","true","44.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Probably something like 1k hours played, and I'll go back to it plenty of times.  I even have an older computer still built to PLAY said game.\n\nX-Com Apocalypse is probably the defining idea of what an X-Com game should be.  The designers are all gaming deities who did the best game that might ever exist for the RTS genre.  Now on to a proper review:\n\nGraphics: Okay, this game was made in 98 I think.  It LOOKS it.  But there's still a lot of details to be found in it.  And you didn't really buy it for the graphics now did yo u?\n\nSound/Music: Again, it was made in the late 90s.  I usually play with the sounds on and the music off.  But for a while I did play with the music on.  It was suitably creepy at times when it needed to be.\n\nOverworld gameplay: Oh where to begin?  Fantastic.  This is the strategy side of things.  You have the options of buying additional bases, training your troops, starting/cancelling research jobs. make friends out of the govervment factions and playing with the in game economy (because your government is a bunch of stingy folks who start out mildly hating you, go figure).  The economy is important to make you enough money to hire more troops, build more bases and equip your aircraft (which go through missiles at an alarming rate).  Plus, this is the side where you WILL have to fight UFOs from.  Which takes a lot of firepower at the midway point.\n\nTactical gameplay: This is the slightly micromanagy part of the game, and I have seen a few issues from time to time.  You can either go with the traditional X-com turn based option, or you can go with a full RTS combat.  Whichever you pick is up to you.  The aliens tend to be aggressive enough to warrant a defensive arrangement.  Humans (alien controlled or just people who you decided to hit up for some money...) generally range from aggressive to fleeing in terror at the sight of you.  The major downsides are that Psi powers have only 4 functions (more would have been nice, but it's an older game) and that your troops even in armor tend to want to stand and shoot (but again, it's an older game).\n\nSome odd bugs: Occasionally I send out 18 troops to hit a downed UFO, the tactical map shows me only having 13.  Go figure.  YES, Steam has a wonderful DOS client analog for this game, but it still will crash usually after 45 minutes to an hour.  SAVE OFTEN.\n\nTLDR: What the hell are you still doing reading this review?  BUY THIS GAME NOW!","July 17, 2015","true","38.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It’s not just “shoot everything that moves”, you have to plan ahead, you need to research alien technology  and use what you find out, if you want to win. You build facilities, buy and/or manufacture the things you need, maintain the relationships with other organizations, keep infiltration to a minimum and ensure funding, and you train your agents so they won’t end up kia. There is a lot more to this game than just shooting aliens.\n\nIf you compare with newer games, graphics looks kind of … well, but this game is 18 years old.  It has its own style. I’ve seen and played other games with this theme and they are really nice and well made, but I often miss what I would call “soul” (don't know what else to call it). It’s no secret; I like the old version best. The style and “soul” is unique and maybe a few understands what I mean, it's more like a good friend for almost two decades than it's just a game. I beat apocalypse at least once a year, and I too have the original cd, scratched and unplayable but still very orange and I intend to keep it just because! :D\n\nMy final thought is: people are still buying and playing this game.

X-Com! this one was probably the very best!\n\nThe amount of detail they put into making the world, all the items, weapons, equipment, vehicles, aliens, enemies, entities, factions, right down to level design and overworld design - this game will have you totally immersed, whether or not you care for the graphics.\n\nYou can carry out raids on enemy factions/gangs for some vigilante justice, you could even choose when you want to go on a mission, either by pre-empting an alien alert in a building, or letting the alert call you in, and even then, you could totally ignore it and let the aliens infest the building and ultimately, let the aliens take over that faction!\n\nThere's a working economy, you'll start off as a buyer in the market, in order to equip your troops, but the gains you make from raiding enemy factions, and collecting alien technology means that you can eventually turn a profit on top of your organisation's (X-Com!) income from the Senate. Prices do change depending on supply (albeit only a little, but it was great they put it in); and of course, the world reacts to what you do on the market too, if you sell dangerous alien weaponry en-masse, don't be surprised to see it being used against you on the streets!.\n\nCombat; you will want it to be slow-paced and turn-based, even if there is an active real-time mode, because you want to think every action through, and make sure your squads are prepared to react to whatever contingencies arise, and proceed effectively and efficiently to gain the best mission outcomes.\n\nDo too much damage to the building, or injure or kill civillians, and expect it to show up on your bill, as well as a reflection in your relationship with that faction (a totally hostile faction can mean that they may outwardly attack your bases or personnel on the overworld, or if the faction is an infrastructure provider or an arms dealer; you'll find that their services will be denied to you - i.e. taxis will not deliver your new recruits, ship manufacturers will stop selling you ships, Android alliances will stop allowing you to recruit androids, hospitals can stop providing you medkits); of course, if you blast enough craters into the building, it could simply crumble down around your squad, wiping them all out. This of course, also means that there are destructible environments, every block on the map can be flattened to dust and ashes.\n\nThe research tree is another magnificent mechanic in the game, from quantum physics, to xenobiology, every bit of research leads to meaningful discoveries of powerful technology and understanding of your enemies, where you can harness the power of their weapons against them, to discovering weakesses they have, or possibly even develop bio-weapons that will be lethal to them only! D: Research enough tech, and you'll find yourself being able to manufacture enough weapons to outfit a small army, with your very own engineering division.\n\nAll the flavour text about any research you do, to the lore of the world, as well as any factions and entities have intriguing information about themselves that will keep your interest endlessly.\n\nIf you like turn-based, squad based strategy, mixed in with a management sim, look no further :D","June 22, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some of the games were linked in a series, and some were made using the engines from his games but without his involvement. The end result was that the way the games were played evolved slowly, and this therefore has a VERY tried and trusted way of working, drawing on maybe half a dozen predecessors.\n\nthe game, like many others since has two halves. A management level where you oversee your base, building facilities, research tech and build equipment, and an acion half where you do time-based missions. Although the management half was supposed to be vastly bigger, time and technology at the time cut it back. I never felt it was missing anything\n\nthe big question is though, why do people go on and on about UFO and TFTD but never mention this one? everything you can do in those games is here but better. Although old now, it was in much higher res allowing a much better view of the missions. The maps are much bigger and taller, and the technology and story and design is all brilliantly thought out\n\nAtmosphere, that's what's gone\n\nUFO and TFTD brilliantly captured the atmosphere from the earlier Laser Squad. This is too bright and too colourful. In those games, you would need to slowly try to locate the lethal enemy and try to defeat them one at a time. There was a variety of enenmy too, with decently defined roles, in basic terms the most lethal would hide behind the meat-shields and you would need the right weapons and tactics to take them both down.\n\nhere, although on paper there are tons and tons of aliens, in reality there are only two. Shooters who cant shoot, and annoying things that run at you really fast. Most weapons are very weak, but fire so many shots that you just mow down the bad guys. WIth the bigger maps, you can now run too. Seems realistic, but the very idea of running in the earlier games was ridiculous - you crept inch by inch making sure every squad memer covered everyone else.\n\nI do love this game, I do prefer it to UFO or TFTD and I really wish it could be remade with a modern engine, but I do accept it is easy, lacking atmosphere and aliens.","September 12, 2015","true","84.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The back story is simple and coherent - aliens invade, some people sympathise, others get infiltrated. Hold them off while you learn then take the fight to them.\n\nThe graphics are a bit simple by today's standards but they work well enough to get the detail across. Game play is turn based but still keeps you engaged and with squad based combat each turn flows well.\n\nThe AI is good. Your foes take realistic tactical and strategic moves against you, and you will find yourself falling behind if you don't move to recover from mistakes.\n\nThe plot is well structured, and while it is basically linear (as is the tech tree) there is ample opportunity to do some sandbox play along the way. Even thought the game world is limited to the one city, I like the political dimension of trying to keep the various suppliers on good terms with you. Take too much of a heavy hand when dealing with the aliends and the resulting damage to the city might end up with no one prepared to sell vehicles or weapons to you. This becomes less of a driver in the mid-game as your X-COM becomes independent and you are selling more than buying. In late game when start to invade the alien dimension this effectively disappears as most of the conflict happens there rather than the city.\n\nFor new players to the franchise, especially with XCOM 2 on the horizon, I recommend taking the opportunity to play this as well. And for the old hands, what are you waiting for?","January 2","true","32.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

BEST CHOICE EVER to allow the PLAYER to decide!\nGUI: 10/10 everything you need!\nStory: 10/10 default story, but the ufopedia about the creatures...as always (previously Ufo games) GREAT!\n\nI would love Xcom 4, but sadly there is only a terrible, console version which is called a UFO enemy unknown remake, but it isn't!","July 12, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The back story is simple and coherent - aliens invade, some people sympathise, others get infiltrated. Hold them off while you learn then take the fight to them.\n\nThe graphics are a bit simple by today's standards but they work well enough to get the detail across. Game play is turn based but still keeps you engaged and with squad based combat each turn flows well.\n\nThe AI is good. Your foes take realistic tactical and strategic moves against you, and you will find yourself falling behind if you don't move to recover from mistakes.\n\nThe plot is well structured, and while it is basically linear (as is the tech tree) there is ample opportunity to do some sandbox play along the way. Even thought the game world is limited to the one city, I like the political dimension of trying to keep the various suppliers on good terms with you. Take too much of a heavy hand when dealing with the aliends and the resulting damage to the city might end up with no one prepared to sell vehicles or weapons to you. This becomes less of a driver in the mid-game as your X-COM becomes independent and you are selling more than buying. In late game when start to invade the alien dimension this effectively disappears as most of the conflict happens there rather than the city.\n\nFor new players to the franchise, especially with XCOM 2 on the horizon, I recommend taking the opportunity to play this as well. And for the old hands, what are you waiting for?","January 2","true","32.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Probably something like 1k hours played, and I'll go back to it plenty of times.  I even have an older computer still built to PLAY said game.\n\nX-Com Apocalypse is probably the defining idea of what an X-Com game should be.  The designers are all gaming deities who did the best game that might ever exist for the RTS genre.  Now on to a proper review:\n\nGraphics: Okay, this game was made in 98 I think.  It LOOKS it.  But there's still a lot of details to be found in it.  And you didn't really buy it for the graphics now did yo u?\n\nSound/Music: Again, it was made in the late 90s.  I usually play with the sounds on and the music off.  But for a while I did play with the music on.  It was suitably creepy at times when it needed to be.\n\nOverworld gameplay: Oh where to begin?  Fantastic.  This is the strategy side of things.  You have the options of buying additional bases, training your troops, starting/cancelling research jobs. make friends out of the govervment factions and playing with the in game economy (because your government is a bunch of stingy folks who start out mildly hating you, go figure).  The economy is important to make you enough money to hire more troops, build more bases and equip your aircraft (which go through missiles at an alarming rate).  Plus, this is the side where you WILL have to fight UFOs from.  Which takes a lot of firepower at the midway point.\n\nTactical gameplay: This is the slightly micromanagy part of the game, and I have seen a few issues from time to time.  You can either go with the traditional X-com turn based option, or you can go with a full RTS combat.  Whichever you pick is up to you.  The aliens tend to be aggressive enough to warrant a defensive arrangement.  Humans (alien controlled or just people who you decided to hit up for some money...) generally range from aggressive to fleeing in terror at the sight of you.  The major downsides are that Psi powers have only 4 functions (more would have been nice, but it's an older game) and that your troops even in armor tend to want to stand and shoot (but again, it's an older game).\n\nSome odd bugs: Occasionally I send out 18 troops to hit a downed UFO, the tactical map shows me only having 13.  Go figure.  YES, Steam has a wonderful DOS client analog for this game, but it still will crash usually after 45 minutes to an hour.  SAVE OFTEN.\n\nTLDR: What the hell are you still doing reading this review?  BUY THIS GAME NOW!","July 17, 2015","true","38.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's cutting edge hybrid real-time / turn based combat, isometric viewpoint with a full 256 colour pallette and impressive resolution options were amazing at the time.\n\nIf none of that made sense don't worry, both the game and that PC are old. The point is that I returned to this game through Steam just as excited as I was that first time around, not enitirely due to nostalgia but because the game packs so much content into something that by today's standards would require you to pay for it's kickstarter, then for an overpriced pre-order bonus, 4-5 DLCs and finally to sell your soul to come close.\n\nThe graphics are dated but the gameplay is timeless.\n\nBasic Story\nStrange dimensional portals begin appearing and the government fears it is the sign of a new imminent alien invasion. In order to deal with this threat the X-COM agency is made active once again. You are the commander of X-COM.\n\nBasic Gameplay in 10 steps\n1. Manage every day to day activity of X-COM: train agents, buy equipment, fit vehicles, sell loot you stole from that wacko cult surplus equipment.\n2. Launch everything you have at every UFO that is spotted.\n3. Re-load when you realise you didn't buy enough ammo so your Valkyrie is basically dead because you failed point 1.\n4. Learn to pick your battles and track alien movement\n5. Get a pay rise for stopping the Government from being brainwashed into thinking the aliens are 'good'.\n6. Pump out R&D stations to build unique equipment and craft.\n7. Stop picking your battles and start taking the fight to the enemy by employing tactics such as 'stacking 4 teams of 6 agents on top of one another, putting them on 'aggressive' in a choke point and just pressing super fast forward, returning with a sandwich 5 mins later to find you win'.\n8. Toy with the enemy for a while whilst you raid the alien dimension to destroy every UFO there.\n9. Finish whatever research you had been missing as you are a completionist. Although trying to catch a live popper has become harder this late in the game... Sod it, do I need it really??\n10. Wipe out alien threat by total annihilation, don't allow for negotiation or an amicable victory (as sci-fi has shown us time and time again, it's either them or us!)\n\nFavourite part - trying to beat the game on higher difficulty settings after allowing alien infiltration into an important faction like Marsec, Megapol or Transtellar. Definitely makes for an interesting play through!","June 2","true","66.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
