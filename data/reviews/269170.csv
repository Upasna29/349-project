I expected this game to be good, but it blew my expectations out of the water! This could very well be the Vive's main attraction! I could see myself playing this for hours, and hours on end. The social interaction is just so wonderful! The ability to actually see the other players hands and head really adds a new level of immersion to this game!\nI have already made two friends by just joining a random session, talking with them, and shooting some pool! The details in this game (or should I say "accurate simulation"), are so polished and beautifully created, you easily get immersed in a whole new world...or bar I should say. The physics are 100% accurate, and it is not noticably different from real life. This is greater then real life pool, this is...Pool Nation VR! Even if you have no interest in pool, or you have never even played, you will LOVE this game!

I have a pool table in my family room now. This is absolute VIRTUAL REALITY. You\'re in a bar, you can manipulate most things, the atmosphere is great, and the game itself actually has a game IN it :O what a concept!\n\n- There are a number of AI opponents that range in difficulty\n- Winning spawns presents that give you unlockables... it is the MOST satisfying thing\n- The controls, to me, are some of the best implemented in a game for world manipulation, the grip controls are the greatest thing in this game!\n- Using the cue and the aiming system is great, however I wish there was a height adjustment. Being a little taller(6\'1) I find I have to almost squat to line a shot up. But man...it/'s too cool when you sink something you meant to\n- I have yet to try multiplayer, but I\'d rather play AI. But playing with a friend would be awesome.\n- There\'s darts in the game. Not the easiest to play but still very satisfying when you hit the board haha\n\nI hope they continue to update this game with some features that would make it pretty damn awesome:\n\n- Control the music with your own music library, including shared tunes across streams\n- Varied environments and perhaps even a few story modes where you play in front of crowds and have rival VR bots\n- Branch out to Snooker and trick shots\n\nEither way, you like pool?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luuuuuuke/recommended/269170/","Luuuuuuke","Luuuuuuke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luuuuuuke/","72 products in account","Awesome. Awesome.\n\nFirstly, the pool game itself is very good. It’s intuitive and slick, and the whole environment looks great. You can also play darts, but I found this to be fairly tricky. I’m sure it could be mastered with a bit of practice though.\n\nBut that’s not where the appeal of this game really lies. It’s an insight into just how social strapping a brick to your head, in a dark room, on your own can actually be. Until now, fun as it may be, VR has been a pretty lonely experience in most games, but Pool Nation VR changes that.\n\nThe multiplayer mode is hilarious. Even though your opponent only appears as goggles and controllers-for-hands, their realistic movements really do give you the sense that you’re actually in the room with someone. Once you have a buddy to share the space with, the pool almost becomes secondary because there are so many other amusing ways to entertain yourselves. Virtually everything in the room can be interacted with, and the physics are pretty spot on.\n\nBearing in mind that it’s this much fun with total strangers, I can’t wait until VR is more commonplace and my mates and I can have virtual get-togethers, presumably on a more regular basis than is feasible to arrange in real life. I’m thinking poker games etc.\n\nIn the games I played against numerous opponents, neither of us spoke much. I put this down to the poor quality of the microphone in the Vive, and the fact that it was late at night and the rest of my family were fast asleep. Instead, all you can hear (aside from the background pub noise and the music) is the pair of you rapidly descending into uncontrollable fits of childish giggles. I could actually see them physically bent over double, as was I! Almost every time I played a shot, I’d look up and see the other guy doing something comical, and vice-versa. I was crying with laughter for most of the time, more so than I’ve done in ages. We tended to use gestures to show, for example, frustration at missing a shot or an outrageous fluke, rather than saying things out loud.\n\nIt was all the more entertaining because this was on the day of release, so you could see that everyone was still figuring it out and were awestruck by the novelty of it all.\n\nTechnically this game excels too. The textures look great, and it’s the only game I’ve seen that manages to make the resolution of the screens look several times greater than they actually are and as they appears in other titles.\n\nMy only complaints thus far are:\n\n•	I’d like to be able to adjust the position of my grip hand on the butt of the cue. The reason being is because, by default, it’s quite far forwards and I can see no way of changing it. This means you’re hitting your body with the controller as you stroke the cue back and forth. In real life my hand would be further behind me.\n•	Sidespin doesn’t seem to take any affect when the ball bounces off a cushion, and I can’t appear to get the ball to swerve. Maybe I just need more practice.\n-       The background sounds are on a loop of a few minutes, and every so often you hear some bloke banging on about 'Tuesday night, Tuesday night'. If it weren't for him you probably wouldn't notice it looping. It just breaks the immersion slightly.\n\nSome suggestions and wishes:\n\n•	Multiple players (as in more than two), and/or spectators. It would just add to the atmosphere and hilarity. You’d probably need to be able to set up an exclusion zone around your table though to stop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s trying to ruin your games. Either that or a vote-to-kick or some sort of block system.\n•	Access to your own music library. It would be cool if it could be displayed and selected using the jukebox in the room. I could create a playlist and then anyone could choose songs from it to queue up.\n•	I’m sure there’s a technical term for this, but it makes things so much more realistic when objects resist each other. E.g. at Present, I can grab a bottle and wave it through other objects. In Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades, for example, the physics are just a little better in this way.\n•	Following on from the point above, I shouldn’t be able to play a shot where my cue is intersecting another object – a ball in front or the cushion of the table etc.\n•	When positioning your head within a solid object, such as a wall or the pool table, the sound and vision should go blurry, like in Call of the Starseed.\n•	Be able to write messages – maybe on a board so you can hold it up to the intended recipient (assuming more participants are allowed in later releases). Could either type text or scrawl it with chalk or the like. Maybe have a set of predefined sentences and/or be able to define your own (‘good shot’, ‘you fluky ♥♥♥♥’ etc.). This goes back to what I was saying earlier about not being able to talk if the rest of your household are asleep or whatever.\n•	Beer to flow from the bottles and bar taps.\n-       Mirrors on the wall so you can see yourself also.\n•	Change the TV channels, or even play music videos from your library.\n•	More environments.\n•	Be able to create and share new environments, tables, people, cues etc.\n•	Be able to create, style and position bystander avatars.\n•	Be able to control lighting levels etc.\n•	Be able to control ambient noise and music levels.\n•	Have a full head visible instead of just the VR goggles and hats. Could even have facial expressions to select from. Could be amusing.\n•	Hands visible in the game instead of controllers? You could then have hand gestures like in Hover Junkers.\n•	Miscues if you hit the ball at an acute angle and/or haven’t chalked your cue (need to be able to chalk the cue!).\n•	More game types/rules. English pub rules. Red and yellow. Two shots upon fouling etc. Display the rules somewhere.\n•	Snooker option.\n•	Replays. Slow-motion etc.\n•	Pocket tightness adjustment.\n•	Table speed adjustment.\n•	The potted balls to show up in the clear slot on the side of the table like in real life.\n•	Room scale and height adjuster.\n•	Adjust the scale of the people in the room. Everyone seems a bit small, which is fine for the girls, but the guys look a tad out of proportion.\n•	The bystanders to walk around instead of just dancing and chatting on the spot.\n•	Be able to punch the guys and undress the girls. There, I said it. Everyone was thinking it!\n\nTip: You can actually grab the three big lights above the pool table and take it with you to illuminate the sweet, peachy asses of the chicks around the room. You’re welcome. Update: They just fixed that bug. It was fun while it lasted. Maybe they could put a torch in the room instead??\n\nUntil now, Audioshield was my favourite (followed by Project Cars), but Pool Nation VR now easily takes that crown by a loooong way.\n\nI already had high hopes/expectations for the future potential of VR hardware and apps, but this definitely raises the bar and whets the appetite further. Lest we forget we’re only a few months into this whole VR adventure (proper), and if we’re already achieving this then it bodes extremely well.\n\nProps to the devs.\n\nThis is the future!\n\nAwesome.","June 1","true","9.3"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","24","26","3","1"

It's exactly what VR pool ought to be.\n\nThings I like:\n- Arcade-like assists like ghost ball that are completely optional.\n- Multiple game modes\n- Locking the cue in place mechanics\n- Teleport, snap-to-table-edge teleport, AND wand-based positioning\n- Efforts to support a physical table in the play area (though completely optional)\n\nThings I'd like to see changed or improved:\n- Scale feels a little bit small to me.  NPCs are all about 5'2".\n- Ability to turn off NPCs and misc. throwable objects to save performance.\n- More environment choices (with less ray-inducing neon), including a VERY basic environment for performance.\n\nOthers may disagree, but while the environment looks very nice and is lively (nice job!), my personal preference is the quality and performance of the table and game of pool.  I can run medium settings on my GTX 780 with reprojection, but I'd gladly turn everything else off if I could run high settings on the table itself.","June 1","true","3.6"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

The bar is gorgous and has a great atmosphere and the devs took full advantage of UE4's powerful lighting tools.\n\nInteraction with the game is simple, fun, and predictable. The physics of the pool balls and how they move around the table/react to the cue are spot on. It's almost frightening. There's a ton of other stuff in the bar to grab and toss and interact with. You can even play darts and it'll track your score for you, which is pretty cool.\n\nThis is my first VR title with mutliplayer and the feeling of being next to another human (who may be on the other side of the world for all you know) and being able to hear their voice come out of their 'face' and see their gestures and mannerisms, and understand when they're shrugging or leaning on something or holding their hands on their hips when it's just represented by a set of floating goggles and controllers is an unreal feeling. My first multiplayer match was with someone I didn't share a language with, and we just spent 20 minutes throwing bottles and chairs at each other and fooling around and giggling like children.\n\nThat alone was worth the cost of admission.\n\nPlus, the devs are active in the community, seem like good guys (or gals) and are working towards improving performance and adding content.\n\nYou can't lose with this purchase.","June 3","true","7.6"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ronsun/recommended/269170/","Ronsun","Ronsun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ronsun/","59 products in account","The Worry Is Over - Phew..\n\nThis is THE VR game to finally put my mind at rest with regards to whether I did the right thing in spending £700+ on a PC peripheral or not. I now know that I did, and I can now sleep at night in the knowledge that it was all worth it, every single penny. Well actually I still can't sleep now cause I just wanna stay up all night and shoot more pool in a cool bar with cool strangers from all around the world, cause this game is simply amazing.\n\nPros -\n\nSUPER REALISTIC\nAs close to playing the real thing as you're ever gonna get. The feel of it, the ball physics, the controls, all add to an amazingly authentic pool experience. I can't stop thinking about just how good it is. And of course, it's all happening in VR.\n\nMULTIPLAYER/SOCIAL\nI tend to shy away from multiplayer games these days that involve a lot of communication, so was a bit worried about going into this one, as I'm not big on small talk and people end up thinking I'm just plain ignorant. However, my first game was against a guy from the States who helped me settle into the game (after i told him it was my first go) and was very patient as I got to grips with the controls etc. He was very polite and chilled, as most have been in the game and after a few games with various people, i started to relax and really started to enjoy multiplayer gaming again for the first time in a very long time. I guess this is to do with the current demographic of the device, but still, if like me you're hesitant about MP in VR, don't be, give it a try else you'll be missing out.\n\nFUN FACTOR\nObviously the pool is the main fun attraction, and some people like to just get their heads down and play, which is great, I'm a bit like that too, however, you can have SO much fun with the props too, if the mood and company takes you that way. You can pick up basically anything, have fun with it and throw it around, even the Juke Box! and sometimes it becomes hillarious without ruining the game. (though 1 guy did become a tad annoying and over the top, in which case you just quit the match and find another.)\n\nREPLAYABILITY\nThis is the clincher for me. I've never got bored of playing pool in real life, so i really can't see how I'll ever truly tire of this game, and of course - every game is different so it's endless fun and endless possibilities. This makes it incredible value for money too.\n\nCons -  (A tiny one but worth a mention)\n\nMy only small gripe is that the whole game seems a little bit blurry. I understand that they have probably tried to create a smokey bar like atmosphere, but it's not just that, and it's nothing to do with the Vive as things like The Lab are much much clearer. Perhaps they will fix this in an update. It's not a game killer but it is a tiny bit off putting sometimes. If they fix this then to me it'll be pretty much perfect. It is already by far my favourite game on the Vive, or on any other platform for that matter. A massive thanks to the devs.\n\nOVERALL\nBEST game on the Vive by a long shot - no pun intended ;0","June 4","true","12.2"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","2"

It was nice to sidle up to the bar and pretend to order a drink, and throw bottles around. The sound effects from the bar get repeitive, and the AI "extras" just repeat the same motions, but they're not meant to be the focus of the game.  I do like that you can wander around the bar and find a few quiet spots, but there's little else to explore.\nI'm 6'1" tall, and all the AI extras seemed like they were 5'0".  This, combined with how "low" the tables feel, it seems there may be a slight scaling issue.  It would be nice to adjust player height, or be able to adjust vertically with the grip movement.\n\nInterface: The controls were very good and responsive, and once you understand them they feel natural and intuitive.  I am especially a fan of using the grips to move the table around the user - this let me line up shots naturally as I normally would, as well as let me stand in the middle of the table so I didn't have to reach too far into cyberspace that I'd fall over IRL.  The grips felt like using "wheelchair" mode, and was by far the best-designed part of the game.\nI was a little disappointed with the "fine tuning" aiming helper - it definitely helps line up shots, but seems to have the same sensitivity as normal shots (only it locks one hand).  But this is a minor issue.\n\nGame/Physics:  This is the #1 most important issue for hardcore pool players when evaluating a pool game.  The physics are "okay" - it's no Virtual Pool 4.  Cue-english seems to work somewhat, though the table feels slippery, so english doesn't affect it as much as expected.  The pockets on the tables feel very sloppy, at times too tight, at times too wide.  Ball contact angles are pretty solid, so after some mental adjustment you get the feel of how the game wants to be played.\nFor other objects, physics seems janky - beer caps and dice barely bounce at all, while bar chairs will bounce all over the place.  I'm not a dart player, but I felt like I could get to learn the proper throws for darts.\n\nOverall:  If you're into billiards/pool, you'll have a good time.  There are only a few game modes, doesn't seem like you can choose different tables or environments, so it's a pretty limited experience yet.  I haven't had a chance to try MP, but unless networking code is wacked out it should feel similar to playing the AI.  If you're looking for deep career-mode style pool with ladders and locales, it's not here.  If you're not into pool much you may need to pass, because throwing things around a bar at short people who don't respond to you gets old pretty quick.\n\n7/10 - recommended for pool fans","June 2","true","2.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

You spawn into a bar with weird npcs silently dancing/shuffling in the corner, TVs showing ads for a pool game, a jukebox, dartboard, and of course the pool table.\nThe default quality setting of medium did not allow me to hit 90 fps so the reprojection was kicking in and fps was 45. Turning the quality to low, while sacrificing some visual fidelity, allowed my system to consistently hit 90 fps with a minor hit to graphics.\nThe main attraction for this game is the multiplayer.\nAfter starting a game and getting someone to join it becomes a very interesting social experiment. I have played with many people, the vast majority either have their mic muted or have not figured out how to setup the vive mic. Others speak languages that I have no clue what they are saying. A handful have actually spoken Enligsh (I am a stupid American and don't know many languages) and that is where the majority of the enjoyment from this title has come from for me. Playing with a random person, talking as if we were in the same room and playing pool. It is an incredible sense of presence for me and really makes me feel like this random person is in my room.\nThis is where some caveats come: this is the internet and people are not generally known for demonstrating common sense or respect for anonymous people who they will never see in real life. This can lead to people messing with you, some do it aggressively with spamming beer bottles, smashing lights, or the destruction that is the jukebox.\nThe majority of the people I have met have been cool dudes that are as impressed with the game as I am and just want to play a game of pool.\nI strongly encourage players of this game setting up a real life table to lean against and steady shots on. This helps IMMENSELY (use the arrow keys on the keyboard when you are in game to change the height of the table to match yours).\nIf you have a vive I recommend you give Pool Nation VR a shot. I am terrible at pool in real life (sort of) but with ghost balls (cheating, sue me) it makes the game a lot easier and it allows you to have fun with people a world away.\nLast note: The 'hulk mode' reorientation/locomotion was extremely disorienting and disconcerting for me when I began to play it, this has largely gone away and I have acquired stronger VR legs throughout the games.\nOh ya and HATS. I got a pirate one (arrrr) and a cowboy one (yeeeehawww).

Pool Nation VR is truly a great VR experience and perhaps a showcase for what is possible moving forward. It looks terrific and the pool playing feels very realistic, enough that I keep trying to lean on the damn table that doesn't exist! I only have about an hour of playtime, but only because I haven't had much time lately. Stupid real life always getting in the way! ;) I really want to sink more time in this and can easily see my self spending hours in this bar playing pool with buddies. Great job on this one!! Totally worth the 17 bucks.\n\nMinor critiques\n\nI wish you could play an actual game of darts, from my quick experience it seems the score resets after every three darts.\n\nI can't seem to figure out how to put a player name in the box. I don't wanna be "player"!!\n\nOptimization. On medium settings I run 90fps, high 45ish fps, and ultra 30ish fps. I'm running an I7, 32g ram and 980ti SLI on an Asus Rock MB. Now I realize that VR doesn't utilize SLI, but I still feel like I should get higher than  30 fps on the ultra settings. Maybe I'm wrong here. At any rate, I list this as a critique and not a complaint because it looks fine and runs superbly awesome on the medium settings.\n\n9/10 - Will keep leaning on invisible table.","June 6","true","0.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jinxed13/recommended/269170/","jinxed13","Falandorn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jinxed13/","50 products in account","Product received for free\n\nThis game is an absolute perfect fit for VR, with intuitive controls and an accurate physics model this is a must buy for anyone interested in pool or snooker. I played throughout the Beta of this game and the devs made constant tweaks and updates during it\'s development which is a really positive sign.\n\nIn the last update they enabled proper spin/english on the cue ball so it follows natural paths off cushions along with an easy to use height adjustment hotkey. This enables players to use a real life table to lean on when taking shots just like real pool, this increases emmersion and comfort during play. There is an option to use a ghost ball if you just want to play casually but I prefer the realistic feel of playing snooker/pool at home with the guides and aids turned off.\n\nThis game is multiplayer online and I would say this is probably one of the very best experiences currently available for virtual reality so far. I have made some videos on YouTube and recently included a brief review of this last update, just search Falandorn on YouTube and click my uploaded videos.\n\nWith all the current options it is just impossible not to love this game and they are looking to keep developing it in future too.

Graphics are great. Controls are great. Presence is great. There's a good teleportation system--I was able to play just fine with about 4 square meters of space.\n\nYou can move the whole room around to get a good angle, and it's not very nausea-inducing if you look at the table while doing it. There's a grid that appears around you while moving the room, which stays stationary and keeps you feeling anchored in space.\n\nIt's a bit weird to line up your shot when you can't rest your hand on the table, but you can lock it in place so you don\'t have to worry about holding it still while you follow through.\n\nIt felt more natural than any computer pool game I've ever played. I even found it easier to line up my shots when the "ghost ball" aiming aid was turned off.\n\n[after 90 minutes]\nStill really impressed. The resolution of the Vive is a noticeable limitation on long shots. I ended up using the back of a recliner as stand-in for the table itself. With a steady bridge hand I started making shots much more often.\n\nThe atmosphere is tuned really well. There's movement and noise around you enough to make you feel like you're in a bar. I would say it's like a pool hall, but the only pool noises are the ones at your table. But the atmosphere is never so loud or animated that it distracts you. They clearly put a lot of work into the setting and it paid off.\n\nI have not had jutter playing on medium quality. High was manageable, but not smooth enough for extended play in comfort. i7 6700k w/ R9 Fury","June 1","true","1.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Pool Nation VR is a cool game. It accomplishes its goal of providing and hyper realistic pool hall environment in which you can play pool, throw darts, and break beer bottles to your heart\'s content. But like, it\'s way worse than watching VR Porn. I just got my HTC Vive a week ago and a few days later I watched some VR porn and ever since then everything pales in comparison. I want to want to play Pool Nation. I want to want what it provides. Instead I mentally drift back to the sensation of having a porn star dangle her jigglies in my face and tell me how big my Johnson is. Is VR Pool well done? Yeah.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WuJJ/recommended/269170/","WuJJ","WuJJ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WuJJ/","377 products in account","Product received for free\n\nThe game is well designed, but I guess first generation VR hurts here. Can't even read the number on the balls clearly on ultra. I can see efforts being put into optimizing the control, but that's still limited. Snapping to edge is neat, except when I am around the corners. Reposition makes up a little bit for it, but it's still quite unnatural.  There is no way to adjust where I hold the cue. However, I can stand in the middle of table that solves the problem. LOL.\n\nThe biggest issue is the tracking. It frequently fails to track one of my hands. It's not really fault of the game. When positioning the cue, one of my hands will be very close to my body, which means one lighthouse is always blocked. Then if my arm blocks the other one from time to time, I have the cue jumping up and down or in and out. Repositioning my facing usually fixes it, but this affects the overall experience a lot and I have to be aware of where I am facing.\n\nDetail is really important for pool, and thus it's better to wait for next generation of VR headsets. We definitely need 3rd lighthouse for this game. I don't recommend buying it now.\n\n这游戏设计还是很用心的，但是一代VR的显示恐怕还够不上这个游戏的需要。即使最高画质球上的号码也不怎么看得清。操作上设计还是很不错的，传送到桌边很方便，但是桌角就尴尬了。好在能移动台面多少弥补了一些。也不能调整握杆的位置，不过可以站在球台中央击球弥补了这一点，233\n\n最大的问题是手柄追踪，经常一只手掉线，需要挥一挥，换个角度，才能正常。这倒也不能算是游戏的错，桌球有一只手会贴身体很近，这意味着一般来说，总有一个追踪器是被挡住的。如果另一个偶尔被手臂挡住，就会出现球杆小范围乱跳的情况。换个角度一般的确能解决问题，但很影响体验，时不时需要看下追踪站的位置。。。\n\n这游戏细节很重要，需要等到下一代甚至两代VR才行。而且至少得有三个追踪站。不推荐大家现在购买。","June 4","false","1.2"," 5 of 24 people (21%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","21","5","24","0","3"

Controls wise, you hold the cue using the two touch controllers and the game feedbacks via red dot and ghost where you're gonna strike the white and where the white will strike the first ball. When you have the cue in position you pull a trigger which locks the cue, you then pull back with one hand and push forward to play the shot. While locked there is some minor adjustment available using the other trigger. Its not a simulation but its very approachable and fun.\n\nYour opponent's headset and controllers are visible as a ghost of the equipment which is neat. You can customise yourself with a hat.\n\nAlso in the bar you can play darts but this is nowhere near so well thought out and polished. Almost impossible to judge aim and strength. May be with some practice but there are no assistances here.\n\nThe bar looks good and is fun to explore. Managed a steady 45 fps (half of ninety I assume) on high settings from my GTX 970. Most striking difference between high and medium being reflections on the floor. The game feeds back your fps when adjusting settings, nice one! For some reason I seem to be 2 foot taller than all the NPCs. They look and move alright though. Makes me excited for the VR strip club!\n\nHope there are more environments to play in coming, perhaps as DLC.","June 2","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toupee/recommended/269170/","toupee","Toupee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toupee/","203 products in account","This is a killer app for VR, for sure.\n\nI grew up with a pool table in our basement, but it's been covered in laundry and laundry baskets for over a decade. I've had to settle for smoky bars with questionable bathrooms to get my 'shark fix. ... for the record, I'm terrible at pool, but I think it's great.\n\nIf you have any interest at all in pool or VR, this game is for you. In fact, when I heard about it, before I had even purchased the Vive, I was like "That game ... now that is a good reason to have VR." And now it's out, and yes. It is.\n\nYeah, you won't be leaning on the side of the pool table to set up your shots. When my roommate and I first booted the game up, I actually got on my knees and yoga'd myself into a tabletop for him to set up his shot. We quickly stopped that though, and not only because it would have been super weird if anyone walked by and looked in the window*, but because the game's clever controls negate the need for you to set your wrist on anything.\n\nIn 'cue' mode, your two hands are placed naturally upon a pool cue, and squeezing the left hand trigger "locks" the angle and position of your stick. Then you can use your right hand to control the speed (and thus power) of your shot. It works wonderfully.\n\nYou can kneel down and get a line of sight with the cue ball. You can lean all around the table. Walk around it as far as your room-scale setup allows. The teleportation handily locks onto the edge of the table if you aim at it, and always orients you so you're facing a sensible direction. Pro-tip: You can also squeeze both grips to "pull" the scenery around you. (This is super weird at first, but actually SUPER useful and I wish more games had this feature.)\n\nYou're not limited to teleporting just around the table. No no. You have full freedom to roam the bar. The atmosphere really does capture the feeling of a poolshark-type joint, with a bunch of glowing TVs above the bar, a jukebox (which you can lift over your head like a beast, but not load your own music into, unfortunately), darts (and a dartboard to throw at), beer bottles to throw and break, and lots of other fun things to discover. The NPCs are dumb, and don't do anything at all, but entertaining to look at. Partly because they're the dumbest thing in the place.\n\nThe first night my roommate and I got this we only did the 'free play' mode. We basically just traded wearing the headset every time it was the other person's turn. This worked beautifully, and allowed for lots and lots of sipping a beverage of your choice between shots. (Dev request: please enable this to run in full-screen in mirrored mode! Window is too small!) In general this worked just great. It felt like we actually walked into a bar and just started playing around with a table; there were no rules imposed whatsoever. I DO wish that it showed you which balls were already sunk, or had a basic local scorekeeping mode, but frankly it worked so well that we played for basically five hours. This is by far the most seductive VR game right now; we've easily put more hours into this in a night than anything else yet.\n\nThat was yesterday. Today, then, this was the first game I booted up after work and I decided to try an online match. It was an absolute blast. I met a stranger who had played a couple more games online than me, but not many. It had this crazy effect that so far I've only experienced in BigScreen, where it really feels like the other person is there with you. I felt my body language shifting like we were both in the room. I found myself gesturing naturally and laughing a LOT. (It could have had something to do with playing with beer bottles in a vulgar way ... nah, it was just everything.)\n\nAs of this writing, the VR crowd is still so selective. The few people I met when i booted up BigScreen the other night were really cool. Lots of similar interests. I love the idea of the LAN party thing, but we ended up just chilling. Pool Nation VR is even better, because you're actually sharing an activity — a fantastic activity. I almost asked for a friend request from the person I played my first game with... it was just a very natural, very fun, fantastic time.\n\nOh yeah, and the multiplayer gameplay is great. It basically has the scoring system I wanted when I played free play for five hours. And of course you can explore the bar with your buddy and do whatever you want. You're not stuck to the table at all.\n\nAs far as performance goes, I put it on Low straight away. There's a nifty FPS meter that updates on the settings screen. I have a GTX 970 and an i2500-k, and this game usually hovers in the 80-90 range with my rig. Not a solid 90, unfortunately, but the developers seem to be focusing on performance issues, so I'm hopeful it will be ironed out soon enough. In any case, it's not a dealbreaker at all.\n\nThe person I was playing with had a 1080 card and he said that on the very highest settings the FPS were poor compared to most anything else he's tried, but again, the devs are looking into it.\n\nAnyway, get this game.\n\n* Yes, someone did see us playing Vive through the window the other night.

Pool physics are right on!  I do, however have a few suggestions that I think would make the game better:\n\nAbsolutely Needed:\n----------------------------\n1) Implement varying rulesets, or allow customization of the rules (ie: in US 8-ball, non-break fouls result in ball-in-hand only behind the head string, and the target must be on the opposite side of the head string)\n\n2) The "locking" system really needs to use both triggers.  The trigger on the bridge hand should lock in the contact point on the cue ball, but leave the grip hand free to adjust the shooting angle without losing your desired contact point on the cue ball.  The trigger on the grip hand should lock in the shooting angle.\n\n"Nice To Have"\n-----------------------------\n1) Make the "dummies" more reactive to what's going on around them.  Make them duck or yell "ow" or something if you throw objects at them.\n\n2) I haven't checked to see if this exists, but the ability to import your own music or load an internet radio stream into the jukebox would be nice.\n\n3) Darts is kinda weird-feeling, not the fault of the developers, but rather the difference between how you hold a dart vs how you hold the Vive controllers.  Maybe add something else like Air Hockey or Foosball?\n\n4) Implement Cutthroat (a 3-player pool game)","June 2","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What wasn't made immediately obvious to me is that you can, in fact, talk (orally) with your multiplayer opponents within the game. That was really good.  It was really enjoyable playing and talking with some random people from across the planet.\n\nAlso found myself really enjoying playing the darts mini-game with strangers. Yes, this feels like a complete game. There are a few rough edges (mainly performance), but this is a great purchase.","June 4","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great graphics, wonderful features. Truly immersive and fun play. However, there needs to be some important fixes in order to make this truly shine.\n\n- Graphics CHUG at high quality, even though the quality isn't all that high (even on a TITAN X)\n\n- You can cheat by taking a shot from inside or even underneath your pool table, they need to disable this. You should only be able to take shots outside of the pool table!\n\n- English, does not seem to effect physics.\n\n- Would be awesome to be able to customize or choose from a variety of 3D avatars, instead of seeing the generic visor.","June 5","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Feels like really playing pool.  I won my first game, lost the 2nd.   REALLY well done,  Only thing I don't like is the way all the people in the place do the same side step dance. Kinda unnerving.

Do understand I basically have 15-20 minutes play time but if anything wanted to get a review posted for others to see. I played a game against the AI and top notch and love the ability to play pool in VR versus looking at a 2d screen.\n\nBall physics and collisioning seem to be spot on.\n\nIf I found anything negative and if anything I fault myself is the fact that even on Medium Graphics, I was getting the room studder and that shaky camera feeling that causes motion sickness. I run with a GTX 970 so I do need  a newer graphics card which I do plan to pick up the GTX 1080. I did crank the graphics to Ultra and looks great but can\'t play because of my card and the shakiness.\n\nOverall in my limited play, Highly Recommend and looking forward to trying about the multiplayer.","June 1","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

I have purchased pretty much every VR game to date. While I want to support the Devs, I end up refunding them because most are junk "mini games" that arent worth half of what is being asked.\n\nTHIS GAME .. HOWEVER .. Is worth EVERY PENNY. This is the most amazing VR experience I have ever had, and is proof of the VR concept as the future of gaming. Don't hesitate, Buy It, Jump in, Come to the bar, and play some pool. Aside from the playspace grid, I find myself constantly forgetting that I'm not REALLY in a bar playing pool with a funny stranger who laughes and throws beer bottles as I attempt to line up the perfect shot. Couldnt be happier, finally a game that makes the VIVE purchase worth the money.","June 6","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
