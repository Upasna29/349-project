I'll start off by saying that I'm a big fan of the series and I was patiently waiting for 3 years for this game. Checking the website regularly to see if there were any updates. I've played both Book I and Book II multiple times with different builds and playstyles. I love both of those games to bits. Now after 3 years, what we got was a short and disappointing ending to the trilogy.\n\nI really hate to say this, but Eschalon: Book III is the worst part of the trilogy and very unsatisfying in almost every aspect. Not only is it by far the shortest of the three games (took me around 13 hours where at least 4 hours was aimless wandering, trying to find obscure clues for obscure quests.) but it also has the worst world design of the whole trilogy. Around 50% of the world is swamps and all the roads and passes are infuriatingly designed where every convenient way is blocked, making it a huge pain to get around if you're going for the no fast travel challenge. This was not the case in Book II. I'm not sure if I'm just so used to the Eschalon ruleset, but the game was also extremely easy and only after around halfway the game started throwing at least some challenge.\n\nIn the end, it's still Eschalon. It's still fun for what it is. But I really really hate to see the series end like this. *sigh* I'm going to put a thumb down just to balance things out, but honestly I don't know if I'd recommend it or not. If you're a fan, you already have it and this review won't hold a lot of weight.\n\nSinathor out.","February 15, 2014","false","24.7"," 150 of 179 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","150","179","0","0"

If you've played the other two and liked them, than obviously this is a no brainer.  It has some new updates here and there, but overall is the same gameplay as the last two.  I havent gotten into the story so I cant comment on that.  The few hours Ive played thus far have been doing the first towns side quests, and now heading off to continue the main plot I got side tracked with this ship wreck mystery.  No clue what to expect, and thats why I love these games!\n\nSo as I said, this review isnt for veterans of the series, because youll be buying this regardless.  This is for those people that like modern rpgs, and have started dabbling into fallout and arcanum etc and need more.  Thats how I found this series.  I hated Baldurs gate and similar rpgs, but love ones I could take my time with and had full control of every action.  If any of that rings a bell in your head check out these games.\n\nThere is a demo available for all 3 in the series at the owners site, and I highly recommend trying that first if your not sure. Or just pick up the trilogy pack while its on sale. Each game can be played seperatly without knowledge of another.  Id recommend starting with the first game and working my way up. Only because youll obviously get the full story, and because of the slight improvments made in the gameplay and mechanics.  Youll get used to the new features of say 2, and decide to play 1 and miss them and the game will feel limited due to that.  I played them out of order(2 and then 1) so its really not a big deal in the end, but you will be saying wtf why isnt this here or that option there?\n\nSo in conclusion, this is a truly old school aproach to rpgs.  If your excited for the new turn based rpgs from kickstarter etc, then look no further for a game to play while you wait for those.  While those guys were making modern day turds before going to kickstarter, this guy here was keeping the rpg tradition alive and well.  Show your love and throw the dude some cash!!   (Hes working on a scifi game next I believe.  New engine etc, so it should be fun)\n\n","February 14, 2014","true","15.6"," 56 of 71 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","56","71","0","0"

Having just beaten it, however, it felt like a huge disappointment. What an anti-climatic ending. Perhaps Book 2 set the bar too high - in it you ventured from the grassy woodlands, through snowy wastelands, all the way to the tropical volcano home of the enemy Taurax.  The dungeons were vast, the enemies diverse, and the story and events were very engaging. I actually replayed the entire Book II again last winter in anticipation of Book III.\n\nBook III falls on its face in comparison. The terrain and dungeons feel simplistic. The monsters feel like recycled versions of those in Book II, and finally, there feels like there was no innovation in the game engine itself. No new abilities, very few new spells, and for the 2nd time your character is reset to level 1 at the start of the game.\n\nIn light of all this, despite how much I love the series, I cannot recommend Book III.","June 11, 2014","false","40.2"," 40 of 50 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","40","50","0","1"

I guarantee it is more difficult than slaying a dragon.”\n\nEschalon: Book 3 represents a good and solid turn-based rpg, that provides the same gameplay as the last two parts with slight changes in form of a broader spectrum of weapons (finally some unarmed weapons!), more skill trainers, and a change in the support function of certain attributes (e.g. speed vs traps).\n\nOn the other hand the entire game feels less refined. Most locations have only a few enemies, and the overall difficulty has been reduced, resulting in a less challenging environment. In addition the unfavourable map layout invokes the feeling of unnecessarily prolonging the game by restricting access to certain level sections.\n\nTrivia:\n\nLike the predecessors, the game's development was largely kept secret; the developers of the Eschalon series believe that most game developers release too much information about their products, spoiling the game when you eventually play it.\n\nAchievements:\n\nThe game has no Steam achievements.\n\nChronology:\n\nEschalon: Book 3 (PC)\nClassic turn-based role-playing game\n(Fantasy) – 2014\n\nEschalon: Book 2 (PC)\nClassic turn-based role-playing game\n(Fantasy) – 2010\nLink to Steam review for Eschalon: Book 2.\n\n\nEschalon: Book 1 (PC)\nClassic turn-based role-playing game\n(Fantasy) – 2007\nLink to Steam review for Eschalon: Book 1.","August 1, 2014","true","33.3"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","25","35","0","0"

Combat is smart a and often unforgiving, but all of the stats are in the dialoge box and you can really plan your attacks or adapt when you have to.\n\nI'm playing a ranger and in one ecuonter I was out of potions and mana with abouut 20 health left and was in a fight with another archer so I ran into another room and took down all of the torches then I stood in a spot wear he would have to be in the light to shoot at me while I stoofd in the dark.

I've always considered this series to be an excellent example of a no-nonsense, just-the-basics western RPG, and Eschalon III sticks to that tradition nicely. It's got all the core features: turn-based tactical combat, openended skill system, exploration and quests, adventurous (although not exactly deep) story, optional survival elements -- and no fluff or gimmicks. Book 3 does end sort of abruptly and is the shortest game in the series so it feels a bit unfinished, which I'd say is the primary drawback; it's overall less satisfying than the amazing Book 2. Still recommended as this particular style of neo-retro western RPG is still surprisingly rare and this one is quite competent and fun when considered on its own.","February 21, 2014","true","19.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Or at least my experince was terrible.\n\nThis is not an "old school" RPG (I've been playing hardcore RPGs since Ultima 3), it's just a bad one. I'm 4 hours in and I have no plan on continuing. I'd return it but it was a gift so I'm stuck with it. But it will go unplayed. Why?\n\n1. The enemies around all seem to be much more difficult, meaning that every battle is a save-and-restore situation. The ones in the Seawardens' Guild? Too tough. The goblins? Too tough. The ones across the water on the raft? Too tough. The ones on the way to Moonstone? Too tough. I'm sorry that I didn't know exactly what was required in the character creation so that I could make progress in the game but I find it absurd that you have to min/max at the character creation step just to get a few hours in the game. I don't want to quicksave before every battle and quick restore when it doesn't go well. That's not playing the game and that's not hardcore either. It's just a bad design.\n\n\n2. I have 1 gold piece. That's it. Why? I don't know. I had a couple of hundred in a prior save. When I went to load the game I now have 1. Which means I can't identify anything to sell. I can't buy potions. I can't buy food. That tends to limit your options and in a game where I have to consume food to live, I'm on a downhill spiral that will eventually lead me to starving to death. I'd use a cheat or a trainer to fix this, but there doesn't seem to be any out there.\n\nI suppose I could go back to town and rob everyone and everything I can for some gold. But that's not role-playing in the least. It's not something I'm willing to do to fix a bug in the game.\n\n3. Something similar happened with making potions. I went to make a healing potion per the recipe. Success! Great! Then I went to make two others. The ingredients are gone but the potions were never made. Did the potion making somehow fail? There was nothing in the log about it. So again, I'm out ingredients and can't seem to successfully make a healing potion. Bug or working as intended? No idea.\n\nThere are literally dozens of RPGs out there to choose from. I don't need to put up with an imbalanced, buggy game. The Geneforge series is far superior and if I'm going to spend time palying an old-school game, I'll play the better one.\n\nPS - I tried Eschalon 2 and now recall after about 15 hours it too bugged out and I lost about 4 hours of gameplay. The dev asked me to send him the save file. I did but never even received the courtesy of a reply. That's two games that I've had in this series and both ended up entirely bugging out with nary a response from the dev. That's just unacceptable.","October 4, 2015","false","4.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

I'm still early in Book III, so more edits to this review are to come.\n\nNegatives:\n-God damn bugs... (The creatures you can ONLY kill with spells or fire)\n\n-If your an archer your special attack sends a HUGE blow on your enemy, but a huge damage penalty to your bow.\n\n-Game encourages exploration, but punishes you for exploring areas out of your level (which is most of them at least in the earlier levels). This normally isn't so bad, if every single damn direction (except the one your main quest is in) is like this. Even the direction your quest is in has enemies you stand no chance against.\n\n-Hit/Miss seems worse than the first book. Last I played an archer was in book I, and I don't remember missing so often. 50% chance of hits feels more like 25%. Because every single encounter, it feels like only 25% of my arrows land a hit.\n\n-Darkness terrible for both melee and archers. Now it was this way in the first two books, but pair that with the Hit/Miss problem, and darkness is twice a problem.\n\n-Much lacking balance. Somtimes the game doesn't make your objective clear, making me wander into areas where enemies are WAY more powerful than I am. I don't even know if I'm going in the right ♥♥♥♥ing direction.\n\n\nPositives:\n-The story has been made more interesting than the second book, and I feel that I have more incentive to explore (too bad it's only a minor due to the fact that everything is more powerful than you)\n\n-Better portaits (opinion)\n\n-Interesting map design. It's scarier, and the soundtrack brings that world to life.\n\n\nAll in all, the game is still fun, but all the negative things that agrrevate the ♥♥♥♥ out of me, cause me to take a break from playing. Not the kind of "Ok, I think I've had enough adventure for one day!" But more "♥♥♥♥ this". All the bad stuff cancels out the good stuff, and unless things ease up a bit, the game will just keep me angry. This game is avrage in score.","February 9, 2015","false","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you are a completionist, then go ahead and get it but do so when it is on sale.\n\nMy reasons: Eschalon 1 was really interesting to me. I enjoyed learning the system. I enjoyed leveling my character. I enjoyed finding the different armor/weapons/alcehemy ingredients.\n\nEschalon 2 felt like an improvement and expansion of what was good about 1. I could not stop playing it.\n\nEschalon 3 starts out ok. It feels like the other games. But then a few things happen:\n\n1) It is really short in comparison. That can be ok, but this game felt like an RPG with the middle 1/3 missing.\n2) alchemy was ginked. In 2 you found the ingredients you needed to make cool stuff. In 3 even with insanely high Forgaging, I was unable to find/buy the ingredient to upgrade armor.\n3) The combat seemed easier and not in a good way. Sometimes you don't care about the fact that combat is a bit easy. The game is more about exploration etc. But here the game just felt repetitive. In 1 and 2 combat was more interesting, it is tough to explain why.\n\nI respect and love this game developer.

It was a little tough for me at first, to find a class/skills that I wanted to play with at the beginning, and I ended up rotating through about 5-10 different rolls before I found a character that I liked. Luckily, this game doesn't punish you if you make bad decisions early in the game (except for getting caught stealing something), as skill trainers open up as you complete quests. I found this a lot more enjoyable than the other books in the series because I wasn't *forced* to powergame in order to enjoy all of the aspects the game had to offer. I found the quests to be quite intriguing, and exploration gave you a lot to do, and actually rewards you for doing it this time (with experience, and a damn satisfying sound).\n\nThe only issues that I have with this, is that sometimes you'll encounter 'message overload' when you take on some of the challenge rules. For instance, if you try to save when there are enemies around, you'll get 5-10 messages saying the same thing, that you're violating the rule. Then there is undocumented features that don't give you information on how to solve them (like being concussed).","February 17, 2014","true","26.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

And its strong point is to resurrect the adventure simulation and the exploration quality that had some old RPG. It's a strong point of this series and its Book 3 that do it the best. It setup a general adventure management linking exploration, resources and items, character building, combats, NPC and quests. Beside the character building which is rather good overall, and exploration quality even better in Book 3, no other points are strong but the whole is glued and setup a consistent gameplay of adventuring in a world.\n\nThe adventure simulation is quite well developed in the gameplay, and this is very rare in RPG of past 15 years. This includes many elements like map making, alchemy, crafting, attrition and repair, ailments and curing, inventory management with limits to manage, food and drink management, implementation of darkness/light/day/night/weather condition, and more. This also includes a rather good stealth system with influences on combats, stealthy exploration, and in each book there's many opportunities to steal even the good people if that's your choice.\n\nBut it's NOT a RPG/series to buy for combats depth, nor for its main story or writing quality. Also take care that it can be quite short as all Books if you use a character enough OP and rush through the game. Even played more normally and by enjoying exploring and digging the places and secrets, it's not a game with a duration as the classics AAA RPG, or as some very rare indie RPG as Avernum.\n\nOverall it's a great game, the best Book of the series, for the exploration quality, secrets, tricks to find, puzzles, and for the difficulty balance of secrets/puzzles/tricks. It has also the best density of stuff to do, i.e. no or very few empty areas (more or less desert areas without much to do), and no or very few fillers (abuse of repetitions and emptiness). And this Book 3 has also the best graphics which help somehow for building the secrets and mildly hidden stuff. But it isn't the best of the series for the size, it is second after Book 2. Nor for story and the Book 1 has the lead but quote that the writing quality is average in this series. Nor for combats despite few good combats setup, Book 2 has the lead on that, but again combats aren't very deep in that series and are more a part of the whole adventure and world simulation.\n\nThe Book 3 is also the Book of the series which is structured for mods and with mods tools, a feature requested by fans since Book 1 and finally available in Book 3.\n\nThere are demo for each book so try them to get an idea, and even if the Book 1 is a bit harsh, with few forum/guide help it will be an excellent choice to discover the series due to its low price and general quality that doesn't deserve the later books despite they brought various improvements.","February 22, 2014","true","47.7"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","1"

I must say I'm really sad to write this. I had huge hopes for this game, as I'm a big fan of the previous two games. I mean, they both harken to the days of yore when I just didn't care about certain things. I just rolled with it, despite the flaws. This game hugely relies on that nostalgia.\n\nBut now... I can't deny the flaws this game has. And more importantly, it just isn't FUN. No seriously, this is a game right? But I was just frustrated to no end.\n\nThe journey begins with a spreadsheet. Yes its styled like an old paper n' pen RPG, but there's so much pointless skills. You spend an hour just trying to decide what will be good and what will be pointless. I restarted the beginning like 3 times trying to figure out what I wasted my points in. Seriously, sometimes, LESS IS MORE. It was just a headache, seriously. In the town you arrive in, to add insult to injury, NO TRAINERS. ARE YOU SERIOUS?\n\nOh well, nevermind, you arrive in the town, then you have the usual pointless conversations. You are in the middle of nowhere : check. Is there anything interesting, nope? : check. Can't loot anything because your hide in shadows skill is useless : check. Get the town angry because you got curious : check. Can't save because you chose hardcore mode : check. Force quit the game because you ♥♥♥♥ed up : check. And you've got no idea where to go : check. Except, of course, you get a quest to kill bugs.\n\nAnd more bugs. Man, those bugs are annoying. The last straw was when my build, a ranger was unnable to EVEN DAMAGE the... swarm things. They're immune to arrows? What the ♥♥♥♥?!? I instantly got swarmed by like 10 of the invincible dots. And this was ONE SCREEN away from the first town. YOU KNOW, THE FIRST AREA OF THE DAMN GAME? WHAT IS THIS DIFFICULTY CURVE?!?!\n\nThen I built a mage build. I then promptly got diseased with the first step I took in the swamp, reducing my endurance and strenght by half. Permenantly. I killed most of the bugs I saw, then ran out of mana, then I was forced to fight with my fists. With no combat skill. With half strenght. Then I tried resting at an inn. Afterwards I was still ill.\n\nOkay. This is the last straw.\n\nIt pains me to say, but this game is just an exercise in patience. A total waste of 18 bucks. I should of bought it during a sale. 5 bucks would of been reasonable.\n\nI JUST WANT TO PLAY THE DAMN GAME, SO STOP DELIBERATLY SABOTAGING MY EXPERIENCE!!! I want to have fun, not give myself a damn headache.\n\nLast word : If you're a huge fan of the series, you might still enjoy this. In my case though, it seems like they just took Book II and made it less good. If you're new to the series, I recommend just playing the first two games, the second being far superior. I don't understand how they could mess this up so bad.\n\nOh and before you blame me for not giving the game a chance. I did. Twice. And the most important part of a game, any game, is the first 15 minutes. The game did nothing to grip my attention. Worse, it was complicated, unfair and boring. On the plus side, the music was excellent! What epic music to play while you kill roaches. The interface is very well done too. Just like the other games. Let's try to innovate at least a little next time, yeah?","February 16, 2014","false","1.5"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","8","20","0","1"

Understand, the patch was done. His highness just couldn't be bothered with to spend the half hour to upload the patch and push it.\n\nI'm glad to see this game scored in the 60's and my only regret is that I ever supported this smuck.","October 18, 2014","false","0.2"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

Where book 1 was a mediocre cliche macguffin story, and book 2 was a sequel, a cliffhanger, and more macguffins, book 3 wraps it all up with even more macguffins. Sadly, I can't speak much praise about the story without spoiling the entire thing, so you'll just have to take my word for it.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, little has changed from book 2 (which, in turn, didn't change a whole lot from book 1). It still takes the opportunity to make minor improvements, but you can expect pretty much the same experience, just in another continent. (Province? Territory? I dunno.) Like before, the experience was akin to a very, VERY small Elder Scrolls game.","December 12, 2014","true","19.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's why I do not recommend it.\nIf you can get the series as a whole, you will understand why I am dissapointed. Book 1 and 2 are such magnificent games, perfectly balanced out for every role, playable in so many ways, where book 3 seems to be only playable in (almost) one specific way and comes to a very abrupt end. When you think you are halfway through the game, it seems to be over with a stupid ending.\n\nSo I recommend it when buying the complete series, but if you are only interested in a good RPG, buy book 1 and/or 2. If you want to buy only one, take book 2 because it's just as good or even better as book 1 but has improved graphics.\n\nYes, I really mean it, if you like these kind of games, buy at least book 2! Do not buy book 3 if you're only to play one of them.","December 27, 2014","false","46.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have encountered many games akin to this one -- new-age RPGs built with a flair for how RPGs used to be. This delivers in that respect. Not frilly or fancy, it works in every way it's supposed to, and there is a lot to it. I kind of wished the game was longer -- (30 hours of play time) but it was very well worth it at that length, I think I just wished the adventure could go on, and that's a good thing. It does have replayability going for it, with an open character development system (though still class based) and a lot of different things to try, and lots of secrets to discover. Overall, a nice title.","June 21, 2015","true","45.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I have to admit I enjoyed Book III probably the least.\n\nCompared to the previous books, the difficulty seemed to raise steeply. That might be related to my choice of playing Book III with a thief (in an assassin style). However, from what I've read, it seems that a thief is the worst choice for this part, and you'll have the hardest time with it. The game seems very unbalanced in this respect. For example, there are almost no good piercing weapons in the game. Very early in the start you'll meet enemies immune to piercing damage including arrows. Bashing them with my hands didn't really work well... Also, there's no backstabbing, so the thief can leverage being hidden in shadows just in a very specific circumstances. And the list goes on.\n\nThe last quarter of the game seemed to be created in a rush and quite empty. Maybe the developer has run out of money. But it felt weird and somewhat unfinished.\n\nI still enjoyed the game, but... the first two episodes were better.","May 26, 2015","true","58.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
