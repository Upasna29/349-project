There is not even a title screen, it dumps you straight into the game.\n\nOh and the control mapping screen lists spacebar as jump, when that is actually used to throw dynamite in game. Not very confidence inspiring.","May 27","false","0.3"," 95 of 105 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","95","105","6","0"

I don't mean you know what to expect, I'm saying this is THE EXACT SAME F*CKING GAME!\n\nWyatt Derp is the next storm in the sh*t storm coming from the kings of sh*tty developers, Digital Homicide Studios/Digital Homicide Studios LLC. or whatever the f*ck you want to be called now.\n\nI know for a fact that this review is going to mirror my Withering Kingdom review, because they're both the same game FFS.\n\nThe controls are slippery, just like Krog Wars, just like WIthering Kingdom, when you press a key then let go, you bet that it will do it fr another second longer.\n\nThe gameplay is full of bugs that it makes the game ridiculously easy and boring.\n\nHowever, one problem Wyatt Derp has that Withering Kingdom didn't is the animations. The animations that the main character do have no logic or sense attached to them eg: when you roll, the rolling animation is meant for when someone rolls forward, but Derp decides to live up to his name and roll sideways instead.\n\nThis game is c*cking b*llocks sh*t and is one of the worst DH did because they literraly didn't put any effort into this. They copy, pasted the code of either this or Withering Kingdom and put it onto the other and swapped the assets and improved f*ck all.\n\nPros\n+ The quote "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" has a whole new meaning to me now\n\nCons\n- THE SAME GAME = THE SAME CONS\n- Bad animations\n\nFinal verdict: 1/10\n\nMy Steam curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews","May 27","false","0.5"," 83 of 92 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","83","92","6","2"

As shown in my video, this is one of multiple instances of Digital Homicide's re-skinning video games and re-selling them as new titles. Wyatt Derp and Wyatt Derp 2 are the exact same game with a camera angle change. It is also a reskin of Withering Kingdom and Withering Kingdom 2, along with Krog Wars. The conveyor belt of crap continues as they don't even bother to flip different assets. Why bother when you can simply slap another skin on it and sell it as a new game!\n\nSeriously. Avoid this crap at all costs.\n\nIf you are interested in seeing what I'm talking about, see my report here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h532IZSEQA","May 27","false","1.1"," 66 of 73 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","66","73","3","5"

You see the video above? Completely descriptive of what you're getting. There's no variation, except for the occasional groups of enemies that wander around defenseless as you mow them down, or a really big enemy that you have to repeatedly kneecap because you can't blow out their pubic bones with 200 grains of supersonic lead.\n\nThis game is the flagship in a series of Project Flips done by a pair of stooges known to the world at large as Digital Homicide-- makers of such classics as Six Nights at Suzie's and the ever-popular Slaughtering Grounds.\n\nWhy-ette Durst is a lean, mean ballbusting machine-- when he can stand upright. with a pair of trusty six-guns, he mows down hordes of enemies, occasionally switching to a shotgun or throwing a couple of kilos of dynamite over the heads of enemies. Which of course, drops close enough to everyone on the screen that it should blow all of them, White Burst included, to ratshite and back again.\n\nLevels are timed, so if you don't feel like destroying everyone's ability to breed right off their bodies personally, they'll just pile up until you get a boss or bonus stage, and then they simply drink the poison kool-aid all on their own, the poor dears.\n\nAvoid at all costs. If someone offers to give you pewdiepie's annual YouTube income to play this thing for even five minutes, politely refuse, and shoot them in the back as they walk away.","May 28","false","0.2"," 36 of 43 people (84%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","84","36","43","11","0"

If yes, then forget about Wyatt Derp and play Outlaws and Call of Juarez as Digital Homicide's latest abomination is nothing but a reskin of Krog Wars.
