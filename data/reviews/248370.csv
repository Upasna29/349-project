"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeltaBladeX/recommended/248370/","DeltaBladeX","DeltaBladeX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeltaBladeX/","4044 products in account",""And down it goes"\n\nBridge building games doesn't look like something that would be that fun at first though. Stick up some pieces without breaking your budget, make sure it doesn't fall apart while a car crosses, and then continue to the next level. Despite this, there are games in the genre that are truly fun, this being one of them. Let me describe why this should be on your wishlist.\n\nStory\nSome crazed maniac has managed to destroy a number of bridges over the region, and now that they need new ones, they grabbed the first person off the street to create them. Despite your lack of experience and skill, you are forced to ensure that companies can still get their goods transported where ever they need to be without letting the drivers lose their lives.\n\nOr maybe this has no story at all. Its a bridge building game, we don't need a story. But if you do, just pretend it is the one written above.\n\nPresentation\nThe visuals are pretty basic, but you know exactly what you are looking at, and it has several camera options, including viewing from the vehicles themselves as they plunge over a cliff. Materials will be recognized, and will change colour to show how stressed they are with a toggle option. Sound is also suitable, with metal groaning as it threatens to ruin your hard work, and noises from the vehicles. Not any music in this game though. Not really a problem though.\n\nControls\nNice and simple, pretty much everything can be done with just the mouse. Left click will take you through the menu and place pieces of the bridge. Right click is used to remove pieces. Holding the shift key will allow you to select multiple pieces of your bridge so you can copy and paste larger chucks if you want the other side to mirror your current idea. Arrow keys and the mouse wheel can be used to adjust the camera. nothing here to cause any confusion or difficulty.\n\nGameplay\nWorking within the limitations set by your budget and available materials, you will be attempting to build a bridge to cross over various rivers and canyons. These will start simple, with only small areas to build across and only basic materials to make it easy to guess the best choices. As you get further in the game, the bridge will need to be much longer and you will need to mix it up with stronger pieces, cables and even hydraulics so your bridge can lift out of the way of passing boats. Later levels are incredibly difficult as it will seem that you just don't have what you need to prevent the latest travelers from taking a swim, but each of the bridges in the game can be finished. With all the available choices for building your bridge, I much prefer this game over similar titles I've played, none of them matching this for variety.\n\nLifespan\nThe game should last a while. With a tutorial with 3 levels, Easy difficulty with 6 levels, and then Medium, Hard, Complex and Extra each having 8 levels, you have a total of 41 gaps to cross. While there is no sandbox mode as such, there are a couple of cheats available to increase your budget and unlock all materials for that level. As well as all of the included levels, the game includes a menu option to load other levels within the game, though I'm not sure where you may be able to find these additional locations.\n\nIf you have any interest in trying a bridge construction simulator, this is the game to go for. The most options for building your bridges as well as the ability to load custom levels makes this title the best choice.\n\n8 / 10","December 15, 2013","true","7.3"," 145 of 188 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","145","188","2","7"

There is no right or wrong way to complete a level. In fact, every level is open-ended, although it never feels like I'm at a loss for what to do due to a very good difficulty curve, yet at the same time increasingly challenging requirements. Levels are bite-sized, so the game could easily be enjoyed during a short break, and toward higher difficulties requirements and resources tend to vary more and more ensuring that there is no collapse to a single working design.\n\nThis is not the most graphically gorgeous game, nor does it provide the most extensive simulation, but neither is really needed to properly exercise the brain in the regions other than the overstimulated run/aim/shoot reflexes. And should your destructive needs be overwhelming, there is nothing like collapsing an enormous steel and iron structure, watching the passenger train on top of it plummet to its doom.\n\nWell worth the sale price, runs on pretty much any computer, and is a great amount of fun.","November 25, 2013","true","16.8"," 71 of 91 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","71","91","0","2"

The easy mode is just that - easy. More like an extended tutorial really. Once you hit medium and hard the challange starts. Build a bridge with a limmited set of parts, on a budget. Have the bridge survive trains, or cars, or earthquakes. Some even have to open hydraulicly for steamboats to pass. Pretty cool to make a bridge on budget, and holds up the train, just to get torn down by the shipping. Where the game starts to fall short is that once played, there is no reset to start over once a bridge is built in a specific challenge, and there are only about 24 challenges in total. I played most in about 3 hours. Further, many of the hardest challenges are indeed not possible to complete as you are tasked to construct a bridge that does not connect to land on one or both sides, and the test vehicle, usually a train, just nose dives off the cliff and the simulation fails. I don't believe these were play tested in advance. Also, you can not build past the budget, and then reduce the design, once you are out of money, no further experiments can be made. Would be a really good $2 or $5 game, but for $19.99 I expected much more.","January 21, 2014","false","33.1"," 135 of 202 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","135","202","3","4"

You get a set type of materials, from iron bars to steel bars.  Its not to complicated, and is pretty easy to get into bridge building.  The only thing that I had no idea about were suspension cables, but I went through all the maps without ever using it except in a tutorial.  This game would be better if after completing a map it let you go back to it with unlimited funds to build all kinds of crazy bridges.  Due to there being no unlimited mode there isnt much replay value.\n\nThings to remmember:\n*Unticking the autodeck lets you make roads that go up and down, road decks are the toughest material so feel free to use them as supports for the bridge.\n*On some maps you can just let the bridge fall in the water if the deck is above water the vehicles wont fall in and you win!

This one has been sitting in my unplayed library for months, until a few days ago. Like many, I got it off of one of those cheap sim bundles. There are so many crap simulators flooding the market these days and I figured this one would easily fall into that category. I was wrong. It's actually quite good and alot of fun to play. A short 3 bridge tutorial gets you started on the basics. After that you're on your own.\n\nThe object is simple. Build various length bridges to support cars, trucks, trains and drawbridges that can allow boats to pass underneath, all within limited budget and material constraints. There are several different bridge types and material types with different costs and construction methods. The game claims advanced physics simulation. I wouldn't know because I'm not a mechanical or civil engineer so alot of trial and error are needed on my part.\n\nWhen you're ready, you press the simulate button and watch how your bridge performs as people drive over it. If you did you're job right, you can move to the next level. Make a mistake and watch the disaster unfold in rather comical fashion. Stress analysis tools and a simulation speed slider help to pinpoint where the failures are occuring so you can beef up construction or use more expensive materials to try and stay together.\n\nA neat cinematic camera view and even driver camera makes things interesting, especially if you want to see what it's like tumbling into a ravine because your bridge is poorly built.\n\nDefinitely recommend for sim fans and engineers.","July 28, 2014","true","7.2"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","1"

Out of the three bridge building games that I have found so far on steam this one is the top. 1. bridge it plus 2. bridge constructor: an effective watered down version of bridge it plus that has lots of levels, plus I think it works on tablets. 3 bridge project: a piece of poop that just cant get anything right, seriously how did this get approved.

First, the building interface feels clumsy, deleting items sometimes seem to be bugged and you cannot delete the whole bridge with one button. It requires you to delete all components individually.\n\nThe second flaw is that there is no feedback about strength, weaknesses and costs of materials.

You can build draw bridges, suspension bridges, heck, you can build bridges that look like women doing yoga. Plus you dont have to just win the approval of measly little cars, you have trains that make your bridge look like it was made of toothpicks. or you can cause an earthquakes to shake it down.

It's pretty much the standard affair, with different materials and pieces to use (including hydraulics, suspension, or normal bridge) as well as both rail, motorcar and boat bridges that makes the game varied and interesting. Levels vary in difficulty at a good pace, and you can save bridges or scenarios which is a very useful feature if you've created an especially awesome bridge and want to keep it. Graphics are crisp and enjoyable, and you can rotate around the bridge or view with a cinematic camera bringing a more interesting feel to the game. A feature I also enjoyed using was a first-person view from the car or train or boat crossing the bridge which adds yet another dimension to the game. If Bridge Constructor is a shallow mobile port of a bridge builder, then rest assured this is the real thing. Highly recommended.","February 20, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The "improved" graphics may be more intensive and pretty, but the GUI is as or more ugly than BCS with less hotkeys (or at least never shown what they are). The levels are generally the same as BCS, without the custom levels that were bundled with it, so DONT buy this for more levels\n\nHydraulics are in it, luckily, but since no level editor, I cant have fun just making ridiculous hydralics contraptions.\nNo reverse hydraulics (pushing out, rather than pulling in), so less functionality, and multi-plane editing seems to not exist, and ive finished up to halfway through 'complex' difficulty levels, so i doubt it will exist\n\nAs a game, outside of its predecessors, its quite puzzley, and the income is the biggest thing holding you back from completing the levels, limiting who many beams you can build. Theres a limit to selected beam types in some levels, but thats usually rare.\n\nSometimes the physics for cars/trucks is stupid and the vehicle will turn over on a road too steep, when it was fine on the same gradient on a different stage of the level. Its reproducable, so I assume its a slight difference from the hydraulics moving a region back and forth.\n\nIn BCS, Ive had issues with the split joints (for hydraulic stages) not rejoining when near each other and stalling the level (a failure), but not in this one so far. Not sure if the distance for rejoining has increased or just different bridges, but it has worked well.\n\nOptions: Very few, only resolution (from a fixed selection), antialiasing, fullscreen, v-sync and low-res textures. No music, and the sound is too loud for my liking, but no volume slider or mute button for that. Had to resort to Windows sound levels. Performance was NEVER an issue, with max options, and normally I run with 0x or 2x AA, but its not an intensive game\n\nConclusion: As a game in the bridge building series by Chronic Logic, its quite disappointing, but as a game in its own right, its a decent puzzle game, with rotary-joint, fixed or suspension beamed, bridge builder simulator game, with few options and no level editor.\n\nGo buy 'Bridge Construction Set' from their website. It may be cheaper, maybe not, but it is a better game in every way, with nothing less, except "fancy" graphics, which dont help the game","March 18, 2015","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
