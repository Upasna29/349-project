"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/230860/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","I will recommend this game but cautiously. It is fun, it does come with a large selection of tower choices, has controller support, it is local co-op (with controller support) and it does have two parts to it's campaign. It does fall a bit short in keeping the gamer's attention.\n\nCannon Brawl brings a new sort of game style to the table. Similar to Castle Storm (which is also a good game), Cannon Brawl's purpose is to destroy the opponents castle. Unlike Castle Storm (which has it's own rooms to upgrade weapons), CB doesn't allow you to see into your castle or upgrade a javelin like device to take out your opponent. What you are working with though is a hero (of your choice after completing a bit of the campaign) where each hero have their own special ability (such as one hero heals towers when in proximity). The approach the game has taken towards commanding ones towers is quite admirable.\n\nIn fact, it's what probably separates the game from being another boring Castle VS Castle type game. Unlike Castle Storm where you can summon and control your hero, you are ALWAYS in control of your hero. The hero flies through the air to either build new structures or command a tower. Before building anything, the hero needs to grab territory VIA using hot air balloons. When these balloons are placed, the player may build within the vicinity. The balloons also provide extra protection as they can take a hit instead of a bullet or bomb hitting your tower. Gold is the currency used by the game to build new towers on the landscape. To acquire gold (or diamonds), the player must build a gold mine on top of either element. Diamonds may not be available to build on and the player may have to shoot away at the ground to properly expose them. Upon acquiring enough currency, the player may build a tower. These towers (to name a few) come in form of a simple cannon tower, a rocket tower (which shoots out a grouped rocket which then spreads out), a shield tower (to protect from nasty air assaults), a laser/rail gun tower, a bomb tower that launches a walking bomb, and a bank tower that can bribe one of your opponents towers to take it over.\n\nI haven't mentioned all the towers but there are quite a bit to choose from. There is a key combination I found that usually leads me to victory using the gold mines, shields, rocket and laser tower accordingly. Some towers have adverse effects such as using a laser tower against a shield tower. If the laser does fire onto a shield, the shield will rebound the laser in another direction. If you fire in the wrong direction or angle, you can expect a shot going back your way eating away at the ground and dropping your tower from an obscene height leading to destruction. All towers are available for upgrade and make the game even more interesting. I have mentioned that the ground can be blown up as seen in Worms Armageddon. This is a great feature to the game and really makes you think of the locations regarding gun placements.\n\nVisuals are suited to the games cartoon atmosphere. The effects after something blows up or when something hits a shield is visually apparent. The sounds are equally as good as they reflect exactly what you are doing whether it's flying, shooting, or defending. The music is enjoyable and the menus are presented extremely well. If you can find local co-op easily, you know you've got a good interface. Navigating the campaign mode is done on a giant map. There two levels to choose from as you progress : the next mission and puzzle levels. Puzzle levels can be survival to trick shots.\n\nOverall, a good game but not worth it's stated price. Even when it was on sale I was still on the fence. I do enjoy the game and come back to it here and there, but once you've had your fill or have beaten all there is to beat, you may not like it anymore. I definitely enjoyed my time playing it.\n\n\n\nRATING : 7/10\n\n\nGameplay	B	Story / Campaign	B-	Visuals / User Interface	B-	Sounds / Music	C+	Replay-ability	C+	Overall 	B-","December 13, 2015","true","4.9"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

This game has a lot of charm, and a neat little mechanic of having to travel to the turret in order to operate it.  It also has pretty good use of a variety of turrets.\n\nWhile the game started well and was quite enjoyable, the game's mild annoyances for me become too annoying in the later levels; I completed up through Level 13 and accomplished some of the Puzzle levels.\n\nThe Good:+ Charming game and I really liked the early levels\n+ Good graphics, art style, and animations\n+ Nice campaign and looks like quite a few levels\n+ Nice twist and adds something new to the "artillery" games\n+ Has multiplayer  (I've only done the solo player campaign, but seems like a great option)\n\nThe OK:~ Tower selection Cooldown.  There are cooldowns even before you can select the next tower to build from the Castle.  Why?\n~ "Actions Per Minute" Star Rating?  I understand and agree with beating a mission by a certain "Time Limt", but that's a different Star Rating, and I like that one.  But if I beat the mission in a certain time, why does it matter how many actions I did or DIDN"T do ?   APM simply measures how "busy" you are; which has nothing to do with how well or effective you played.\n~ Tower Placement.  The placing of the buildings to be built which dangle beneath your airship as if you are transporting them to where they go.  This isn't intuitive for placement selection and is mostly problematic when trying to place "territory expanding sky-balloons" which I kept having to settle for "close enough", yet end up NOT being close enough after all...\n~ Every level is something new.  A new tower this level, another new tower next level.  A dozen levels into it there's just all sorts of stuff -- just seems too quick; no time to enjoy the turret you just got.  It's like they couldn't decide which towers to include in the game so they through them all in, or they didn't want to make enough levels to support gradually introducing them.  They should either remove some tower types or create more levels so as to introduce them at a better pace.\n\nThe Annoying:- I apparently stink at this game. I shouldn't have to TRY this hard to complete some of these levels...on NORMAL...and I don't mean "complete with a 3 star rating", I mean "just-crawl-your-beaten-down-carcass-across-the-finish-line" complete.  I'm clearly doing something wrong.  If I wanted a greater challenge that's what higher difficulty settings are for, and puzzle/challengs maps, and getting all Star Ratings.  Not simply trying to complete a level and having my "castle" handed to me...   again, I'm clearly doing something wrong on this game.  (My point is, I shouldn't have to watch 'How to Beat' youtube videos or strategies or anything...that might be for playing harder difficulty levels, or finding easter eggs, or seeing how people beat challenges, etc...not just for simply how to get past Level X on NORMAL)\n\nOverall this is one of the few games I really want to like but can't recommend because it got annoying and frustrating for me to play.  6 out of 10.","February 3","false","5.3"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

It feels like a twist between Worms & Defense Grid. It's campaign is quite lengthy with three objectives per mission, puzzle missions and a series of balanced unlocks to explore new pilots and towers; each with their unique abilities. The art style is cohesive and the pefect amount of cartoon fantasy for the loose story that it presents.\n\nGameplay elements like bombs that walk to their destination after being fired to lasers that bounce off of shields (including a player pilot shield on one pilot which can be used to bounce the laser in otherwise inaccessible angles). The gameplay is very quick and the AI is competative & enjoyable to play against. After around 4 hours of play, I'm near the end of the campaign but after that there is still nightmare mode, multiplayer and AI skirmishes.\n\nThis is a great value @ 15$ and is extremely polished for an early access game.

It is a brilliant game with a fun story that makes you want to keep playing, as each new level is a new challenge and not some repetitive nonsense to increase story length.\n\nAlso, if you guys didn't know, this is the game that won Activision's $100k game concept contest.

Who doesn't like giant cannons?\n\nBasically the goal is to destroy your enemy's castle using a strategically chosen set of cannon types. Turtle Sandbox has given you a variety of methods and combinations of cannons that allows you to decide between decimating your enemy entirely, or (if you're like me) slowly wittling away the ground underneath your friend's castle, giving them a small gleam of hope. Of course, for them, there is none - something you illustrate by using your drill or laser cannon to knock out the remaining support below their castle, making your friend watch their base (and hopes) fall to its demise. It's sophisticatedly savage.\n\nThis is a great game on its own (campaign), but multiplayer is where it really shines. The number of combinations of cannons and tactics used by others is limitless and always different. If you were on the fence about it, get down and come shoot some cannons with me.","March 28, 2015","true","14.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

The stages were unique, the units were interesting and the selection of characters helped keep the game fresh. I did have minor gripes about the online play because some units were far too easy to spam, which crippled the game's deep learning curve and threw strategic direction out the window. That aside, the single player was a load of fun. The game is far from perfect, but it's worth the price tag.\n\nGet it!","March 22, 2014","true","8.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The campaign begins as a sort of tutorial but doesn't hold your hand. The beginning is easy on you as you learn the basics but it's still fun because it's gameplay is just inherently fun. The campaign gets a lot harder as you progress and the enemy has new buildings you have to fight against before you get them yourself. It also has an XP system where you finish challenges and can compete online to obtain the XP which buys updated buildings and new pilots. All I wish is that more people (such as yourself) buy this great game so I can fight you online. I've never had trouble finding a match but I seem to play the same people a lot and get my ♥♥♥ kicked and I want to kick some ♥♥♥ myself so go ahead and buy the damn game.

They as well agreed that this game is an incredible game. if you want a cheap multiplayer game this is definiteley a good game for you.

I also like the XP system...that is, you'll unlock more towers/structures as you play.  It's a bit like CastleStorm in that it's a 1vs1 experience, though you don't get to build troops and send them off across the battlefield.  Rather, you can continue to build structures and fight for control over territory...something you couldn't do in CastleStorm.

In gaming, those words are so true. Even if a game doesn’t quite do it for you aesthetically or something about it kind of bothers you… if you play it, maybe then you’ll realize the truth of the game. Cannon Brawl hit me much the same: a basic, simple RTS-type game. (It’s unfortunately hard to truly capture the essence of a videogame in videos at times.) Then I got my hands on Cannon Brawl at PAX and my eyes were opened. There is a lot of fun to be had here and there is quite a depth of strategy to go with it!\n\nSo every map starts out much the same. Two players or you and an AI each control a base on opposite sides of said map. Your objective is the blow the other guy’s base up. There are plenty of tools at your disposal with which to do that. Maybe you’re a direct approach guy/gal and love how lasers dig straight at your opponent’s base giving you an easy in. They can trump you with Shield Towers to deflect those lasers back at you. Then you could choose the Bomb Bot Blaster tower to send Bomb Bots to walk through their shields, but then they dig a ditch and your bombs are rendered somewhat mute. There are multiple weapons and all of them serve their purpose well. For me, the exception to the rule is the Missile Tower. To note, all of my friends use the Missile Tower well and like it. However, I’ve just found it to be an indirect approach to victory and that’s not my “thing” most of the time. I want things to do more damage, not a spread of lesser damage. It’s hard to pin-point an attack with that weapon.\n\nThe story, while feeling like it’s setup to give you an introduction into the world of Cannon Brawl, does more than that. The campaign serves as a way of unlocking multiple towers and characters to use in multiplayer battles and while doing that, proved to be rather fun. Players who don’t want to get their feet wet in the world on online competitive multiplayer games should defeat the single-player campaign and unlock Nightmare Mode. Some of the early levels will prove simple if you’ve picked up a few strategies and tricks along the way, however some of the levels are just plain brutal! I remember watching my bud play a level called Laser Defense and the enemy would quickly amass about eight to ten lasers all pointed at my friend’s base. The rounds didn’t last very long, but man did he get close a few times… to living longer.\n\nCannon Brawl also brings back something that I miss: sitting next to your friends and playing games. I know that some people have arrangements where this isn’t an oddity to them. For myself, a lot of games that are Versus or Co-op are all online. We can feel connected all we want with Raidcall or your preference of communication, but nothing beats sitting next to some buds all yelling and cheering while playing the same game on the same screen. Cannon Brawl provided a lot of fun at a bud’s recent bachelor/LAN party. It was one of the highlights of the night other than playing some TF2!\n\nThere is plenty of content and multiple mash-ups of levels and weapons to be had. So much so that you’ll have to be quick on your toes to best the people over the net. Coincidentally, that’s also where my one fault with the game lives. The map variety for Versus play is good. It’s not great, but it is good. It would be better if there were more maps to play on. More could be added in later, that’s not the issue, but I think this may be enhanced by allowing users to create maps. Open up the size of the maps as well so that you could have small, medium and large settings for some truly epic, if not way-to-drawn-out matches! I think this would also be a way to make some of the other tower options one takes into battle a little bit more desirable. Suddenly the Mountain Maker and the Floating Platform seem like great ideas to get to the other side or higher up for a better angle.\n\nScore: Tasty!\n\nCannon Brawl is a frenzied, strategy RTS that is tons of fun with or without friends to play with. The single player campaign is fun and interesting enough to make you want to play through (aside from it also giving you towers for free). The only complaint I have is with the multiplayer. There are plenty of ways to play whether you want to play with a friend locally over a LAN, or challenge them directly over the net, against a computer AI or online against others. The issue is in the levels. I love the levels that are there, but there isn’t as many as I’d like. Cannon Brawl’s battles can get real repetitive aesthetically even though the battles are fun. Maybe they could give us more maps or allow players to create levels themselves. With the numerous amounts of variations you can pick with the towers, I just wish I had more places to blow up.","September 19, 2014","true","16.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/230860/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","\nCannon Brawl, by Turtle Sandbox, is an RTS, or Real Time Strategy, in the view of what I would think Worms would be if it wasn't turn based. In this game you will have to be quick, vicious, and courageous. You will have to defeat the Evil Uncle that seems to have imprisoned some of the finest sky pilots there are as well as the King. You will have to deal with his trickery, and of course his ever growing collection of buildings/weapons that are there to try to stop you. Will you be able to win back the kingdom, or are you destined to be shot out of the sky.\n\nGraphically the slightly cartoony look fits this game like a glove. Its not too graphic intensive, but at the same time it looks good, and holds up well to the speed of the game. The 2D sidescroller feel definitely scream to my days with Worms, especially when it comes to the landscape, though part of me want to lean towards scorched earth. Anyways all the buildings have their own look and all fit their abilities to the letter. If you want a rocket launching building, well they have one of those, and not only that but the upgrades to the buildings definitely bring some of the weapons from puny to world destroying, in their appearance.\n\nThe sounds of the game are basically what you would expect from firing off your weapon, having an attack hit your buildings, or your shield, and of course your victory or your defeat.\n\nThe controls for the game scream, "PLAY ME WITH A GAMEPAD", but have no fear if you do not have one, this is still a very playable game. You are going to be using WASD, space, and X most of the time, when you are not using a gamepad. You are also going to find that you need to be secure with your control scheme quickly, otherwise you are not going to last long enough to save the kingdom.\n\nAlright so lets get to it. There are several different modes that you can partake in. My main focus, of course, was on the campaign, where you set off to try to save the King. Now of course you will have to wage many battles, and rescue others before you can get to the king, but I will tell you this right now, you are going to have fun doing. Throughout the campaign mode you will unlock new, sometimes more "your style", buildings that will enhance your ability to survive the game going forward. Some of the buildings are as follows: Rocket launcher, shield, repair, bomb, nuke, freezing/disabling attack, and much much more. Oh and to make things interesting you get awards for each level. The main one is for winning, but there's also awards for doing so many actions per minute, and of course the other one is trying to defeat the level in a set amount of time. Don't worry though, you can still progress through the game if you aren't able to complete the other two.\n\nNow of course you have to be wondering, well how hard can it be to just throw a bunch of weapons down and just let them go to town on the enemy. Well here's the deal, you are going to have to mine gold or crystals to get the money that is needed to build the weapons, you are also going to need the space to place the weapon, oh and it will have to be within your influence area. You see you can't just throw a bunch of stuff right next to your enemy, you will have to fortify what you have, or try take over what is not your's that will in turn help you take down the enemy all that much faster.\n\nYou will also have the chance to unlock new pilots as you are going through the game. They all have different abilities that can help you win battles. My personal favorite is the driller, there's nothing quite like seeing your enemy setup all nice and cozy on a rise, and then using the driller's special ability to dig the ground from under the building. Then of course there's the magnificent falling of said building, and then the triumphant crash. Speaking of unlocking characters and weapons, there's also quest or goals that you want to strive for, if you get those you get extra points that can be used to unlock new characters and weapons in the armory section of the game.\n\nNow of course there is more to the game than just the campaign, but if you want to survive the battles against AI opponents, or live opponents, you might want to play through the campaign just so you have choices when it comes to what you will be using against your opponent. I will fully admit, I'm pretty sure a live opponent would wipe the floor with me, my downfall is focusing on upgrading a couple buildings and then the next thing I know my opponent has down the arsenal, and its all coming at me at the same time.\n\nNow I think it is clear what I think of this game, and that of course is that it is crazy, fast, fun, and sometimes frustrating, but I want to keep coming back to it. Once you've played around a little, and you are ok with having the game speed set to a brisk running pace, you will find that one level or two just isn't going to satisfy you, you are going to want to destroy your enemy and take on all that you can. So with that I give this game a 9.3 out of 10.","October 14, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It’s a tower defense game on acid whose goofy, loving best friend is permanently stuck to its hip. It’s elegantly unique, and opens up an entirely new door for indie games.\n\nWith your war machine and defenses in tow, your job is to start claiming land. By using your war machine to drop buildings and weapons, you’ll slowly start taking over different parts of the island — claiming your stake not with a flag, but dastardly war devices. Of course, these buildings don’t come cheap! You’ll have to set up mines to claim gold or destroy land to mine for diamonds. This takes some time, and you can bet your nerdy butt that your enemy is scheming up their very own plan of attack.\n\nThe real magic of Cannon Brawl rests in its non-stop action. It’s taken all the best things about real-time battle strategy, and thrown away all the boring bits. It’s a constant game of critical thinking, and you’ll need to keep your eyes on the prize every second, lest your enemy float through your mass of defenses. And trust me, that battlefield can easily become an awesome cluster of madness.\n\nThis is definitely a game destined for all collections. With a nominal $14.99 fee, it's worth every single penny. It's easily one of the most enjoyable indies I've played in the last few years.

To put it bluntly, it was worth the money.\n\nInstead of the Pro/Con list that most make, I'll put up my thoughts on single and multiplayer\n\nSingle:\nThe story is easy to follow and the gameplay keeps it engaging; unlocking new weapons and figuring out not only how to use them in battle but in conjunction with other weapons is incredibly fun.\nI have to say, my favorite weapons combo is shield and laser beam, coupling them, although at times I prefer to use my own shields to deflect my enemies lasers and destroy their stuff with them.\nThe main campaign will probably last about 2 hours (depending upon your ability to pick up the game) but there are puzzles which can be played but don't need to be to complete the main quests of the campaign.\nAnything you unlock can be used in single and multiplayer which is a great idea, it makes it worth the time to earn xp and unlock select items.\n\nMultiplayer:\nIt's fairly straight forward, same combat as single player but against a person.\nMy experience was one that involved learning and it helped in my single player campaign as I tried multiplayer early on when I had few items and lost because of it.\n\nI would definitely suggest this game to anyone who loves strategy or just a fun game to play with friends.","March 11","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The thing is that you don't have to put hours of practice into this (like one might have to do with starcraft which is the reason i don't play it anymore) as long as you have a good understanding of how RTS' work you're basically settled. I have yet not played vs random opponents in the multiplayer. The campaign is fine although not very challenging most of the time.\n\nMy only complaint is that the menu is slightly clumsy at times and you can't use the mouse. Also some of the pilot artwork is really weird (especially the driller she looks like she has ♥♥♥♥ing down syndrome). The story of the campaign is really plain but it works to give it purpose and a rich lore is not what you're playing this for.\n\nSolid 9/10 if it's your kind of game. Lovely Graphics.","December 31, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Cannon Brawl has improved upon both. I haven't played much more than an hour but its experience has immediately brought to mind Swords & Soliders, Worms.... while already securing a place for itself in my memory.\n\nThe game is quick but that is part of the charm for anyone who doesn't have time for lengthier or more competitive RTS games; the actions-per-minute goals (APM) attached to the early levels are easily attainable and pragmatic. That is, when the game says it expects at least 13 APM, you find yourself nodding in agreement instead of shaking your head in exasperation that anyone could play that fast and not be a professional gamer. There are smart details in user interface as well, with cooldowns being explicitly shown, and previous flight paths of your artillery being logged each time you come back.\n\n$14.99 might be a bit much for some people for the length of game you get - on sale it is an immediate must buy. Regardless, I recommend it in either case.","February 6","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game controls are quite clunky, and would definitely be better if a mouse could be used to control the airship, but this is a minor gripe.
