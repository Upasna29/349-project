The series runs in episodes, each season after season 1 has had 5 episodes in total, this being the third season. They also used to have comics, and a tv show back in the 90's.\n\nBuy this.","July 22, 2014","true","8.0"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MuirDragonne/recommended/31220/","MuirDragonne","Muir","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MuirDragonne/","1290 products in account","Brief Synopsis: The Devil's Playhouse is the third season of the Sam & Max series. It is comprised of five episodes. Sam & Max games are point and click adventures which are set in a fictional version of New York City. The games are full of slap stick comedy, word plays, and in jokes. They're simple to play, yet have a nice level of challenge to them in that the solutions to the puzzles often require doing things in a certain order.\n\nLong Review:\n\nStory: This is, in my opinion, the weirdest season of Sam & Max yet. Max has developed psychic powers from being exposed to toys from "The Devil's Toybox" and the freelance police duo soon find themselves the target of several different beings who want the powers for themselves.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are pretty much the same as they've been from season 1 (simple, cartoony). Any other type of style just wouldn't work well with this game, which is perfectly fine. There are very few, if any, glitches or other graphical bugs in the game.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The music and sounds are what you would expect in a Sam & Max game. The music is upbeat and catchy where needed, downbeat and slow where applicable, and cheesy everywhere else. The sound effects fit into the game well and are of a decent sound level so as to not drown out the voices and background music.\n\nLength: Each episode takes around 2-3 hours to play if you're following a walkthrough. If you're playing the game purely under your own steam, then each episode will probably take you around 4-5 hours to complete.\n\nReplayability: There really isn't any replayability to this game. Once you finish it, that's it. There are no alternate endings or variations to the story.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game. The jokes are funny, the story imaginative and irreverent, and the length of each episode makes the asking price well worth it. My advice however is to purchase all three seasons in the series and play them in order as they are all a continuation of one huge story; that is, the story of the lives of Sam and Max.","May 26, 2014","true","2.8"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","20","22","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jadziatuvok/recommended/31220/","jadziatuvok","Nicholas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jadziatuvok/","763 products in account","The third season of Sam & Max represents a shift in tone and gameplay. The changes are obvious from the very beginning - a narrator to set the scene, new control scheme (same as Tales of Monkey Island; clearly favouring consoles), a new villain, an opening tutorial of sorts (which is so entertaining and interactive that it puts most other tutorials to shame), psychic powers for Max and a grainier, darker graphical style.\n\nIt may sound like a lot of changes to a successful formula, but it works well. Not only does it provide a quite accessible introduction for newcomers to the series (including clever little pop-up profiles of characters and notes in a journal about the case and clues), but it also provides a fresh spin on the series for veterans.\n\nOf course, the series lives or dies by the writing and puzzles, and thankfully both are still strong. The new villain, Skunkape, is wonderfully voiced and a highly entertaining character. A few old favourites are missing, while others return (as well as some who are not quite favourites; the Stinky clan seem only slightly more popular than the late, unlamented Soda Poppers…). There are some wonderful lines, with even more smashing of the fourth wall than usual – a few particularly good remarks about non-player characters, for instance.\n\nPuzzles are made a little more interesting through Max's future vision, which offers a glimpse of dialogue from a later scene. It's generally relevant to a puzzle at a particular location, and offers an idea of what to do without giving too much away. Another power, teleportation, saves a lot of the tedious trekking around, which is especially useful as load times seem a little longer than previous games. There's also a bit of a change in mindset with collecting items; they're no longer all directly used for puzzles, with some being clues to unlock new locations. Those new locations look quite similar to the old ones (lampshaded by Max), but at least offer a bit of a feeling about a wider gameworld.\n\nThere's a few scripting oddities, with certain events not triggering when they are supposed to (the intended initial teleport scene, for instance, didn't come up for me until quite late in the game because I chose something they apparently didn't expect the first time), but other than that the game seems to work well.\n\nThe episode is probably the most promising start to a Sam and Max season yet, and with the tease of more powers to come, and hints at future storylines, there's a lot to draw a player into the following episodes.","November 30, 2013","true","8.9"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

If you come off playing the first two season (which are great don't get me wrong) you might feel overwhelmed at first, because there's a lot of new stuff coming at you at once. There's Max's powers, new and old faces. Lots of locales (instead of just about everything happening on their own street). The story is better with this one.  It's weird and manages to hold everything together and stuff. The puzzles are btter with two possible categories of solutions, Max's powers and your regular inventory. Coming up with the right solution can be incredibly satisfying.

Sam and Max contains a lot of humor, most of it pretty dry, but it works well for the game. The actual stories are fun and it isn't 100% straightforward so you might have some difficulty finding the answer. Note: in the game, you can actually change the amount of hints that Sam and Max give you as you play.\n\nThe controls are pretty bad. This is not a deal breaker because the game doesn't rely on quick actions--far from it. But the movement of characters through the game space is pretty difficult, especially if you are only planning on using a mouse. It was slightly more palatable with a keyboard.\n\nIn the end, this was just a small blip in the experience. Sam and Max is a bit of fun and I know each episode I can complete in about 2-4 hours which is nice.\n\nI would recommend not paying the full price--the collection of the five episodes is probably worth it at around $10 or less.","January 29, 2014","true","4.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Expect the same kind of mind-screwing puzzles, but more perplexing and yet more reasonable than ever before. Hints generally feel organic and a natural part of conversation, and things you've likely come to expect from adventure games are ruthlessly mocked and subverted. There's really no telling where the story goes next, but when it does go there, it feels as though you really did have proper warning, and it doesn't just come out of left field. Some moments do end up turning into pixel hunting, but it's far, far more rare than other recent adventure games. The ending is, well, notable. I'd say I'm most impressed by the much different nature of Episode 2, but you'll see that when you get to it. The game certainly knows when to be serious and when to loosen up, and swings between the two at an excellent rate. In short, a truly engaging puzzle game with plenty of laughs, but keep some brain bleach on hand.","July 11, 2013","true","5.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

In some of the locations, it was especially annoying to get Sam to go where you wanted him to be.

Even I'm blown away, and I thought I knew what to expect. The only way to describe it is what Serenity was to Firefly: a continuation of the same story but with much higher production values. The camera seems to have an actual film quality now, the scenes shadow, and the characters feel more like claymation (my PC actually shuddered a bit at the reqs, but if anything this subtle stagger only makes them seem even more like stop motion puppets.) They've added so many things that will make you grin from ear to ear when you realize. Two things, though. The movement controls are worse since this was the first game really meant for console controllers: it's annoying but serviceable. Secondly, as before, you *really* need to play through the earlier seasons first. The overall characters and plot keep pushing forward, and you'll be completely lost without past events to hold onto.

Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse (Season 3) delivers the best in Point & Click Adventure Games. The Devil's Playhouse features direct control and optional hotspot highlighting as well as real-time shadows. In the previous 2 seasons, the player could control only Sam, with Max roaming around, but in this season, a prominent new gameplay feature is that Max gets Psychic Powers, and to use them the player can control Max directly from a first-person perspective. Puzzles are designed to focus less on inventory use and more on applying the limited set of new powers creatively. Another new feature is that Sam has a notebook with information on the case (and your immediate goals), characters and Max's powers.\n\nUse Sam & Max's newfound Psychic Powers via the Toys of Power to battle a Host of Villians bent on destroying the Universe! The Show is about to begin in... THE DEVIL'S PLAYHOUSE!!!\n\nIn Episode 1, General Skun-ka'pe (Skunkape) comes to earth looking for a future telling toy, but Max finds it first.  Now Sam & Max must defeat Skun-ka'pe after seeing a vision of the future showing his attack on Earth.\n\nIn Episode 2, The year 1901, Sameth & Maximus travel to Egypt to obtain The Devil's Toybox in a movie watched by their Great Grandsons.\n\nIn Episode 3, Sam attempts to recover Max's stolen brain, only to unwillingly help a pharoah unleash his own ultimate reality to the world.\n\nIn Episode 4, A seemingly infinite amount of Samulacra (Sam Clones/Dogglegangers) begin attacking the city, leaving Sam & Max to stop them and discover who is the mysterious "Clone Master".\n\nIn Episode 5; The Series Finale of Sam & Max, Sam must return Max, who since the last episode\nis now a Building Sized Monster AKA Maxzilla, to his normal form before he destroys the city.\n\nYou can get Sam & Max Season 3: The Devil's Playhouse for the PC/Mac OS X/iPhone/iPad\n& on the PS3's PlayStation Store.","January 2, 2015","true","26.1"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

The artstyle fits this game better than say - Back to the Future. It's a very similar game to BTTF so if you liked/disliked it, you'll probably form a similar opinion about this game. One difference is though the humor of Sam&Max that won't appeal to all. All in all, if you like Telltale's offerings or are familiar with Sam&Max, it's a decent game. However if you are unsure whether this kind of game interests you, I recommend passing on it.

Each episode takes on a different storytelling genre like sci-fi, adventure, and Lovecraftian horror, but still packed with the witty banter and puzzles of previous Sam & Max games.\n\nThe first thing I should point out are the controls. Rather than clicking on where you want Sam to go like in Seasons 1 and 2 (and pretty much every other P&C Adventure), you click and drag, essentially creating an analog stick with your cursor. Oh, and Max has psychic powers now. New to S&M (wait, that sounded wrong) are toys. No seriously. Now Max can teleport (but only to people's telephones that he has the number to), there's a ViewMaster that lets him see the future, and a ventriloquist dummy that lets him throw his voice. But some other people are after The Devil's Toybox, and it evolves into something bigger than in the previous seasons.\n\nIf you've already enjoyed the previous S&M games, pick this one up and finish the trilogy.","March 14, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would recommend playing through the first two seasons to fully appreciate the third. That being said, if you ever wanted to jump into the action, now is a good a time as ever.\n\nSam & Max were originally comics, now a successful episodic series (I'm looking at you, Valve). They are a blend of click and point adventure and quirky puzzles - the solutions are often unconventional, and the results are zany enough to leave you scratching your head and fun enough to push you to see more. If you're ever stuck, not to worry - there is a handy hints system where the characters will continually berate you with agonizing hints until you figure it out.

You know that feeling, when you think of a perfectly good solution to a problem, but it isn't specifically the one that the game is looking for, so it rejects it?

Each game gives an example of it. Especially Devils Playhouse!\nIn the 3rd season of S&M, Max gains psychic powers, making gameplay more interesting. You can teleport, read minds, transform, see the future, throw your voice in objects, shrink into a "Can O' Nuts", and use a cool robot with 'lazerz an ♥♥♥♥'\nI am sure people really enjoy this game, but it can also be very infuriating!

After finishing The Devil's Playhouse I went back and played the previous two seasons because I enjoyed this one so much. Both of those combined are about as good as TDP.  There's a really good mechanic where Max develops supernatural powers where he can look into the future and morph into different objects, and can teleport to different locations, along with other abilities using toys from the infernal Devil's Toy Chest. There are a lot of creative ideas employed  throughout the episodes. The humor can be a bit sophomoric at times and some of the jokes fall flat, but overall there's a lot of good jokes  and the story goes all over the place and is sufficiently epic. Not quite as good as Tales from Monkey Island, but it's still another gem from Telltale games and I definitely highly recommend!","March 10, 2011","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've played all their games, up to and including this, and they even had some comic books and a TV show.\n\nThis third season of Telltale's revival in the series, upholds the same quality comedy level as LucasArts introduced back in 1993, though the challenge of the puzzles have decreased slightly (we are talking about puzzles in 80's and 90's adventure games, those things were pretty difficult).\n\nIt's not to say that it makes it any less of a good game, not in the slightest. I do recommend playing through Seasons 1 & 2 before getting this, as there are a few jokes in the continuity, and the graphics + controls get an upgrade that most people wouldn't be able to go back to the old seasons once they play this one.\n\n(And I was interested in the series BEFORE the preorder items for TF2 were an issue, so I actually wanted to get this for the game itself.)","July 3, 2011","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Use of some interesting mechanics involving the toys themselves that made it fun to solve.

Unlike many adventure games where you have "Look", "Use", "Touch", etc. commands.  All you get to do is click on something or use an item on something.  This latest series goes a bit further and give Max psychic powers to use.  It's still simpler than most adventure games though, and I really appreciate that.  Even though the gameplay is simple, it was still tough for me to figure out some puzzles.  Granted, some of the solutions doesn't sit right with me, but most of it does.\n\nI think the story is great too, except for the ending.  It's just too anticlimatic.","February 8","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sadly, playing those games added very little context as this game is grounded in complete absurdity, as are the previous titles. Still, I enjoyed every mind melting minute of all of them and this one is easily my favorite. The controls are a bit wonky to start but you get used to them, and the writing is absolutely at its best. And, even though the game is complete batshit insanity at all times, it actually made me feel for the characters involved. At times I actually felt sad for Sam and Max. Actual, real emotions for two characters that have no regard for the feelings of anyone or anything around them.\n\nOh and for anyone wondering about the length of the season, it's roughly 2-3 hours per episode if you aren't an absolute master at these games and maybe only 1.5 hours if you are. I'm okay at puzzle games like this but due to the complete lack of sanity in the puzzles, some solutions stumped me. Basically, you're looking at 7.5 - 15 hours total which is a decent chunk more than the previous titles.","April 27","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The whole series is definitely worth a look. If anything, at least pick up the Devil's Playhouse, which is the most polished installment of the Telltale Seasons, but the first two are also enjoyable and there are also a few story tidbits that you'll see in the earlier seasons. It's not absolutely necessary to play the earlier games enjoy the Devil's Playhouse, but in certainly helps complete the experience.","December 27, 2011","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
