"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/recommended/297120/","CueZero","CueZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/","1640 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe moment I start Heavy Bullets I'm assaulted with a minimal bright neon colored title-screen and a trippy melody with hazy vocals blaring over the glitched sounds of the menu like I've stumbled upon some kind of Philip K. Dickian Hotline Miami. I instantly think to myself "Yep this feels like something Devolver Digital would publish." This is of course a very good feeling.\n\nThis exceeds any rogue-like FPS before it in every way, and ups the ante by having very well-thought out and carefully planned gameplay. The action and combat are more than solid, intense and the atmosphere is engaging; with enemies that can pop out of bushes killing you in a heartbeat, the panic of realizing you haven't loaded all those bullets you picked up, all powered by a pulsing electronic soundtrack that creeps up on you as you come closer to dangerous areas.\n\nThe roguelike elements here work *very* well. You are placed into the thralls of a glitched neon world with harsh and bright hallways randomly generated everytime, the goal is to reach the end of each floor and eventually make it to the 8th floor where you're tasked with resetting a malfunctioning mainframe. Sounds simple, but equipped with only your 6-shot revolver this will prove to be a true test in frustration as there are monsters, turrets, and worms hiding around every corner to whittle away at your already very limited life. The floors are randomly littered with items to help with this, and you'll find banks where if you're playing smart enough you can buy life insurance or deposit money that carry over into your next playthroughs, making things slightly easier each time.\n\nSeriously if you like roguelikes at all buy this game. If you like first person shooters at all, buy this game. If you like crazy artsy games with insanely stylish visuals and trippy sound design, buy this game!","May 16, 2014","true","25.8"," 159 of 181 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","159","181","0","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cheesecake_Recipe/recommended/297120/","Cheesecake_Recipe","A Victim of Stars","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cheesecake_Recipe/","882 products in account","Heavy Bullets cuts down most of the fat surrounding games that venture to use the Roguelike genre, a refreshing take after dozens upon dozens of titles that use hidden depth, tons of discoverable combinations and, situational item usage. It’s a bit of a double edged sword but the lack of complexity is a nice alternative. Heavy Bullets pushes everything aside for a much simpler and, at times, more effective method. As a wise prophet once said, “Six bullets… more than enough to kill anything that moves.” And your employer seems to adhere fairly strictly to those words!\n\nHighrise Hunting Grounds is run by some questionably dense people. It’s difficult to tell if they’re sinister or just willfully ignorant of human rights, sending a janitor down into the depths of their intricate hunting grounds to find out why the mainframe is going crazy and turning the park’s security systems against the very people they’re meant to protect. Plopped down into neon hallways that look like they could be very delicious popsicle flavors, all you have is your gun and your wits about you. As you progress through the 8 layers of hell, there are vending machines and hidden secret cases holding useful items like rockets and homing grenades, as well as a few items that make you wonder how they ended up there in the first place. Using the ritual blade will, for instance, harm you for an entire heart’s worth of damage in exchange for giving you back the exact amount of money you’d need to heal that heart back.\n\nThe crux of Heavy Bullets’ gameplay loop is simplistic genius. Whenever you fire a bullet from your gun, you have to run over to it and pick it back up again in order to reload it into the revolver. At first you only start with just enough bullets to reload an entire cylinder but you can eventually find, buy, or have bullets given to you through inheritance. There’s a slight margin of error in most rooms near the start but you’ll need to come to grips with your twitch action skills before the halfway point. Messing up a shot will require you to dash into danger, more often than not to recover your rounds, and, even with your Quake-speedrunner pace, you’ll still likely take a hit or two. My heart was pounding in the later stages of the game, even after I had upgrades to increase my reload skill, bullet recovery distance, and extra hearts!\n\nAs per the standard for roguelikes, you’ll be dying often as you come to grips with what the game demands of you. This will start off as a tad bit of an annoyance but the game does offer some small level of continuation to ease you into that one run where everything will go right. Available in the vending machines are purchasable items that allow you to pass a certain amount of money you’re carrying into your bank account when you die or, more importantly, the Last Will item which deposits every penny you have on you as well as any bullets, bombs, and keys. You’ll be given the latter three instantly at the start of your next run. This is pretty much the key to being able to afford as many health and stat upgrades as possible during a run. I, myself, had built up almost $1,000 in the bank before my first successful run, during which I spent a good chunk of that reserve.\n\nJust when you start feeling comfortable, the game tosses new enemy types at you and changes up the scenery a little bit. Instead of the simple walls that looked like they could have been gradients on a new-wave CD stacked in Tommy Vercetti’s car, some blinking computer bits and crude technological chrome begin to adorn the walls. You’re also given a flashlight after a certain point, though the game never truly puts you in the complete darkness. Sadly, it only changes so much visually but, then again, you’re hardly really looking at the walls when you’re constantly fighting for your life.\n\nIn keeping with the minimalistic approach, the sound design is sparse but executed with razor sharp precision when it counts. Music occasionally cuts through the deafening silence to energize a particularly ballsy suicide run on a full room. Corny musique pipes through the vending machines, coming across more like slot machines tossed out from a casino on the dead end of Vegas city limits and re-purposed. Every creature and malicious turret has a unique sound of their own that you’ll familiarize yourself with rather quickly. Learning the telltale signs of each is key to surviving large and tricky rooms that use tall grass and rocks to block your line of sight. Some players complained about the music’s lack of presence, but I feel the use of silence is extremely important in not only building up the tension of every fight but also to let you listen in on these clues before things get really hectic.\n\nFor all that Heavy Bullets does well, though, it comes at the price of not having much in the way of replay value. Once you’ve beaten the final boss you have nothing further to really do. The game’s achievements hint at a few challenges you could try but, in the long run of things, you won’t be able to easily put 100+ hours into this like many other games in the genre. When stacking it up next to games like Eldritch or Fancy Skulls, it hardly has sea legs worth holding onto for more than a few playthroughs. Unless you’re a fan of replaying for the sake of the challenge, 3 heart only runs with no potions like some insane Zelda speedrunner, it just may not be enough. The basic experience, the thrill of that first completion, gives a nice sense of accomplishment and I think the tense silent moments broken up by spurts of greased-lightning violence are exceptionally well done. But having limited ways of killing things presented to you and randomly placed setpieces which you’ll eventually become familiar with will certainly bum out players earlier than usual. Is this enough to dissuade you from picking up the gun? Well, that’s entirely up to you, partner. You just have to ask yourself one question. Did I fire six shots, or only five?\n\nDid you like this review?

No performance issues.\n-Gameplay is fast with little downtime.\n\nCons:\n-The game has VERY LITTLE content, and a pretty good amount of that content isn't very exciting. Within 3 hours of play, I had reached the final boss and experienced most of what the game has to offer.\n-The graphics and sound, while part of the game's specific art style, are abysmal.\n-Gameplay is VERY unbalanced. You will encounter large numbers of trivial creatures, while occasionally facing off against turrets that are much, much more powerful. While there are plenty of effective strategies I used against these turrets, I found that they are very inconsistent; with buggy mobile varieties that can glitch and shoot through walls, and stationary varieties that can turn their gun a full 180 degrees in the blink of an eye. This makes gameplay against these foes extremely frustrating.\n-The game offers the ability to save your money and items for later runs, but this is very slow, boring, and grind-y. This is also the reason why this game should be considered a rogue-lite rather than a true roguelike.\n\nSome other points to consider:\n-There is no real story present except for a few lines of start-up text, but this isn't really a bad point in my eyes; I'd rather have no story than an awful story.\n\nOverall, I'd say that Heavy Bullets isn't a bad title to play if you get it on sale (AT LEAST 50% off) or in a Humble Bundle (I got it in the Humble Roguelike Bundle), but you are overpaying if you pay the full $9.99 for it.\n\nThanks for reading (assuming you did).","May 15, 2015","false","3.2"," 113 of 163 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","113","163","5","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joogl/recommended/297120/","joogl","DorJoogl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joogl/","31 products in account","Heavy Bullets. Where to start? At first, I'd like to say that this game is nothing for people who expect to finish the game within the first or second run. Death is permanent in this game and one of the essentials in the whole gaming concept itself. Once you're dead, you have to start the whole game again. However, the effects of death can be overcome by thinking of a clever strategy and planning in advance.\n\nBut what is this game even about? You start with a normal revolver filled with six heavy bullets and three bombs at the first level. The main mechanic of this game implies that you have to pick the bullets up in order to keep your revolver full to the brim. However, as you wander through the maze-like generated world, you encounter many sorts of enemies with their own and unique weak spots which you have to find out in order to make up your own way of beating the game. The game gets progressively harder and you'll be facing boss enemies at the fourth and the eigth level. Of course, you cannot beat them without proper preparation. That's when shops come in handy. You gain money by killing enemies, items by purchasing or finding them throughout the whole game (they can be both, passive or active) and special perks by upgrading your skills. With the right combination, you'll be able to finish even the worst enemies off.\n\nThis makes the game amazingly challenging. If it seems like you can't get past a level, you have to try harder. Don't stop until you have successfully beaten the stage. If you do stop however, then you're in bad luck because you may never get past said stage. The game forces you to play extended sessions which makes you come back for more. Furthermore, I do have the feeling like the game is adjusting to your style of playing since the more you play this game, the harder the earlier stages get. (If someone could verify said assumption, that'd be great.)\n\nThis is not just a FPS game where you are supposed to kill every enemy in sight. It's quite the opposite once the gears are running. With every death the game teaches you about the things you did wrong. Being in a tricky situation doesn't mean that the game's random generation is trying to outsmart your tactics, but you may want to think about a new strategy then.\n\nThe art style is very simplistic but still neat to look at which adds a bit of friskiness throughout the whole game itself. One thing I greatly acknowledge is the game's soundtrack. Although the game makes you think that you're in a serious situation considering that your inventory space is limited and you have to make choices wisely, the music emitted from the medbays, bullet shops and banks knocks you out of the skies and shows you that you may need a second to recover and think about how you're going to progress. It's not all about guns and bombs, you know?\n\nHowever, there are a few minor bugs in this game which will (hopefully) soon get patched, but influence your way of playing heavily at some points. Sometimes, enemies recognize and attack you although you're not in plain sight (or/and if it's not declared in their attacking scheme), but hidden behind a wall. Sometimes, the game seems to lag out for a few frames periodically which can delay your actions significantly. However, like I said, those are minor bugs and will eventually get removed some time. They are no reason to consider not buying the game.\n\nAfter all, I'd like to say that Heavy Bullets is a nice and refreshing twist for everyone who wants to take on a new challenge. The key to success is to never give up no matter how impossible a certain situation may seem. Everyone who thinks that this game is about blindly killing enemies is out of position. The game requires good reactions and a strategy to fulfill. If that sounds like your cup of tea, then this game is made for you.","October 27, 2014","true","15.9"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","19","19","0","0"

The random generation is really good; I never encountered myself stuck or in unfair situations that can’t be solved by your own skill. It has some heart pounding moments which makes this game memorable at times, but going through random adversity never gets old.\n\nIt has an interesting item variety, which can help you or ruin you over. However, while some items make for different and interesting play styles, I wish the game had more to offer.  Many of the items are only there to be used for the achievements or feel arbitrary, meaning you’ll be selling those or ignoring them altogether. An update that expands the item pool would be greatly appreciated, but I also appreciate that the game is mostly skill focused and you don’t need to rely on the items in order to make it to the end, but they help.\n\nDon’t expect a deep plot or story in this tittle, it constantly contradicts itself (In purpose) and anything regarding the ‘plot’ is told via flavor text and some small things within the game. Its main focus its gameplay with very minor plot elements.\n\nOverall, the execution is original and really fun. The idea of having to recollect your bullets in this manner is something I’ve never seen before, and it’s well executed. Being able to play the game at your own pace is a great addition too. Go slow or go fast, is a blast.\n\nWarning!There are people suffering with stuttering while playing, there are many theories for this issue and you can read up more about it on the forums. I play this game on a very out dated toaster and barely noticed issues regarding this, for me it’s rare to say the least. But the stuttering can prove unforgiving or to ruin the game entirely given its nature, if you suffer from it and can’t find a way to fix it, a refund is recommendable. As much as I enjoy this game, no one should go through that, and the creator should make a better effort to fix this problem.","November 22, 2015","true","45.0"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

I don't think it's worth 10 bucks but thats subject to each person's opinion. It has some replay value and even if it doesn't particularly grab me I find myself loading it up every so often.\n\nPros:\nIt's got some pretty interesting mechanics what with the bullets being reusable and causing you to retrieve them due to the fact that you have nothing to defend yourself if you run out of bullets. The whole rougelike mechanics are pretty heavy in this game as well. You don't really make a lot of money off of enemies so with the prices going up the deeper you go it becomes really important to balance what you want to spend your money on. Potions, healing, bombs, the discount (which should be top priority), your life insurance, etc. With money being so important it both makes sense and sucks that almost everything in the game only sells for 5 dollars, with a few exceptions.\n\nCons:\nAlthough it can be fun I can't really recommend it to people, as interesting and unique as it is. As many have said there is an unsolved sutter issue that happens every so often. Its pretty random when it happens. You can go a whole game without it and sometimes you cant get it to stop. On top of that I feel like theres some balance issues with hitboxes and such. I've been attacked through a wall from around the corner by one of the imps as well as a crawler. Turret placement can be a real pain to deal with when its only weakpoint is behind it and it shoots two times per second. The turrets are deadly accurate as well, forcing you to constantly move in order to dodge them which can really put you at a disadvantage if theres more than one or other enemies in the same room. I've also had it on more than one occasion where a turret's bullet clipped a corner and still damaged me even though I was out of the line of fire/line of sight.\n\nOn top of all that the developer has given up on the game so there won't be any updates in the future. It's a pretty barebones game that has the potential to be better but sadly wont be. I wouldn't mind seeing some more balances, bug fixes, and additonal items and enemies.\n\nI personally wouldn't give it more than 6/10","March 26","false","2.9"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","2"

So you could technically just grind until you get enough money to buy every single thing you need in one playthrough.  But that would be lame.  You wouldn't do that would you?\n\nAfter you fire bullets, you can pick them back up from where they land, and put them back in your gun.  Bullets and coins will gravitate to you if you get close enough, and you can upgrade that feature.\n\nShops, enemies, and levels are randomly arranged per playthrough.  Shop inventories are also unpredictable.\n\nMain thing I wish this game had was a difficulty option.  But if you want hard mode, just get drunk or high and play it.  Legally of course.\n\nCo-op or deathmatch would also be nice.","September 3, 2015","true","13.2"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","20","23","4","1"

Overall, I'm quite content with my decision to buy this game, although there's still a few things that really prevent me from fully enjoying it.\n\nThe pros:\n\n1. One thing I really like about this game is that each enemy is unique and challenging in their own way. No one enemy feels too easy or hard too fight by themselves.\n\n2. A problem that you sometimes see with games that have randomly generated levels is that they occassionally throw something nigh-unbeatable at you if you're unlucky. This game never does that. It gets harder as you go, but every death you have feels like its because of a mistake on your part, not on the game's part.\n\n3. There is a small way that you can make future playthroughs easier. By storing money in the bank, you can have a large stockpile of cash to use in different playthroughs to make things easier. If you have a lot of trouble with this game, or if you run across some items that you want to buy but don't have enough money for, the bank has you covered. This really helps to take the edge off of this game's difficulty.\n\nThe cons:\n\nNow that I've gotten the praise out of the way, let me address the one thing that "prevents me from fully enjoying this" as I said. During the beginning of the game, I noticed that it had the occasional stutter. By this, I mean that the game had a rare lag spike, in which everything would freeze for a second, before it would unfreeze, with me in a different spot. This was tolerable at first, but as the game progresses, it just gets worse.\n\nNow, I should probably hedge this by saying that my computer is relatively low-end, but there aren't any options in the settings menu that make the game run any smoother for me. It should be said that Heavy Bullets is the kind of game that you do NOT want to have this kind of glitch in. By the seventh or eighth level, the stutter is so frequent that enemies that really should not be a problem become a nightmare.\n\nOh yeah, and it makes it nearly impossible to beat the final boss, so have fun with that.\n\nHowever, maybe this is just a problem that stems from my pc's general mediocrity, and if you have a better computer, it might work. Alledgedly, the dev is working on fixing this problem, but untill then, it really mars this game's performance.\n\nWith all this said, I still feel that it is overall an enjoyable experience. 7/10. I'll be willing to give it an 8.5/10 when and if the glitch is fixed.","May 12, 2015","true","11.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","1"

Yeah its a small game but its hard and it doesnt FEEL hard. It's not a quality that it easy to explain.\n\nTo understand this, imagine you are running in a field of tall corn. It seems nice enough, and there is cool music on you ipod that your listening too. WHACK. A giant black beast just smacked you on the tushy and you promptly shoot an oversized bullet through it's nostril. Now you didn't know there was a butt-smacking monsters and you don't know how many more there are but you don't know how much more your butt cheeks can take.

So grab hold of what yo mama gave you and get other side of this cornfield because the music is good, the graphics are appropriate and by the of this, you've shucked enough corn to call yourself a farmer.\n\nI hope that made sense in some way and that anology did the trick.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MattBosten/recommended/297120/","MattBosten","MattBosten","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MattBosten/","262 products in account","With the "dearth" of First Person Shooters available on the market Heavy Bullets provides a fresh example that you don't need overly complex systems in place to be fun. In a move completely opposite to Borderlands billions of guns, Heavy Bullets has one, your trusty 6 shot revolver. Each time you fire a shot, you must then recover that bullet in order to be able to reload it and fire it again unless you are carrying more than just the 6 bullets your start each run with. This creates some interesting situations where you'll be aiming across the room and weighing up whether you're confident of hitting your target; missing may mean having to run across the room with no way of attacking enemies.\n\nHeavy Bullets features an ever familiar roguelike formula of randomized dungeons as you work your way through 8 levels with increasing varied enemies; at the end of levels 4 and 8 you will fight a fixed boss. Each enemy requires a different strategy in order to tackle them effectively but all drop when hit with one bullet to their weak spot (The only exceptions being the bosses and one enemy). Enemies are varied enough but if you take a methodical pace you can deal with them fairly easily, as long as you're accurate with your shots. I would personally recommend using keyboard and mouse for this game, I tried using a wired Xbox 360 controller but could never find a setting I was truly happy with.\n\nIn addition to your gun there are a number of items in the world to help (or sometimes hinder) your progress. Each play through I'd race for a backpack which allows you to store an additional item as well as the one you have equipped, The only thing that is persistent between playthroughs is a bank balance which you can use to save money for purchasing items and upgrades, the bank can also be used to store an item for future playthroughs and purchasing discounts, life insurance and a last will. If you die with the last will in your possession all money on your person is deposited to the bank.\n\nThe duration of a playthrough will depend a lot on your play style; I tended to edge around corners slowly picking off enemies one by one and found playthroughs to be between 40 minutes and an hour but it is possible to complete a run in less than 10 minutes (according to the leaderboards!). The reward for dispatching the final boss is a fresh $5000 in your bank, Whilst I mention the bosses, I felt the final boss was a bit two easy once you figure out how to take him out and would clear the room of other enemies before finishing it off. The level 4 boss was a bit more tricky, but eventually you develop the skill to take it out with relatively little damage received.\n\nOverall, Heavy Bullets feels like a fresh take on a huge genre and felt very different to what one would expect of a FPS. It's psychedelic colour scheme and upbeat music make it feel like a strange trip and aside from minor disappointment with the boss encounters its up there in terms of a single player FPS/roguelike experience.","May 7, 2015","true","21.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","4"

That, combined with the already 15% off'd price convinced me to give this one a go despite my typically intense dislike of both Steam Early Access and Procedurally Generated Roguelikes.\n\nTo the former issue, it's fine. The game is basically done and only really needs a release to throw down 'chieves, pokemon cards, and all the other heavy-handed fanfare that accompanies even the most bizarre and unwarranted of steam releases. The most I can say is that the music is a bit finicky, going back and forth between desolate silence and ZOMG COMBAT!!! mode at points where one or the other would be more applicable. It almost brings up the question of why the game is even on Early Access at all. It seems like the developer genuinely seems to want quick feedback from players to help polish the final copy before release rather than doing a quick cash grab to make everyone pay 40 to 80 bucks for a glorified wireframe alpha build like everybody else does these days.\n\nBut there I go being cynical again. Now then, on to the gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay is standard rogue-likey stuff except the combat isn't total floaty garbage. It has a few glaring issues, but for the most part is quite solid. You fire your gun, your bullets the size of soda cans hit your enemies in the soft gubbins, and then they explode in one hit. Enemies actually take a bit to bring you down since you get a pretty generous healthbar for a roguelike, able to take six hits from most regular mobs until dying. Non-boss enemies die in one hit, as stated, but some of them will only do so if you hit them in a particular weak spot, like the power generator for turrets a-la-Receiver. After firing your coffee-can-sized rounds from your Ruger 2.00 caliber Velociraptor, you can pick your bullets back up again like firing a nerf gun and then OCD-ingly making sure you picked up all the foam darts even though you have three more in your pocket because losing them will haunt you for the rest of your days. This adds a surprisingly fun and compelling ammo dynamic where you always have very little ammo and yet paradoxically more ammo then you'd ever need.\n\nIn the first half of the game, there are three enemy types: snakes, chompers, and turrets. Interestingly, these enemies represent the best, average, and worst aspects of the combat respectively. Snakes lie in bushes almost perfectly camoflauged and strike at you out of nowhere, more than once causing me to jump out of my chair and scream random expletives. They can also poison you, which sucks just about as much as getting poisoned has since Final Fantasy One and Pokemon Red and Blue. As much as I would typically throw these off as "cheap" or "unfair", the ammo dynamic meant that I really didn't have any excuse not to throw a bunch of gigantic bullets into the bushes before I went exploring for health potions, so they actually helped endear me to the game.\n\nThe chompers are typical videogame fair. They charge at you mindlessly, bite you when they get up close, and die in one hit. Nothing special, but they get the job done. Later on in the game they "spice it up" by throwing spider chompers, flying chompers, or that eternal unwanted scourge of all shooters that is apparently as easy to shake off as Zaire-strain Ebola and just as entertaining, the Kamikaze chomper. SSDD really, but nothing wrong with mindless mooks in a shooter. If anything, they make the encounters with snakes all that more epic.\n\nThe turrets however are somewhat of a pain. To kill them, you have to hit them in their power generator, which can often be placed behind them when you enter the room. Often you'll have to thread your shots to hit their core, which would be easier if your bullets weren't the size of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ coelocanths. Often, you'll attempt to thread a shot only to have your enormous rounds ping ineffectually off the turret's impenetrable hide. The turrets however are bound by no such restraint, as the most common ones fire lasers, which will ALWAYS hit you if you're not moving and will usually hit you if you are. Luckily, they can be easily evaded by jumping over them which has the slight downside of a jump button NOT EXISTING IN THE GAME.\n\nWhich brings me to my main gripe about the combat. The combat is essentially a modified version of an InstaGib Railgun match in Quake or Unreal Tourney, and as such it is ABSOLUTELY INEXCUSABLE to not have a jump button. In addition, this would add to the dynamism of combat by allowing you to jump away from those evil snakes or jump over and around a horde of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. If anything should be added, I think this should be prioritised.\n\nAs to the rest of the game, it's a standard roguelike affair with upgrades, cash, and permadeath. Worth noting though is that the game has a rogue-lite banking system that allows you to store money for future runs, store valuable items, and even allow you to keep your items, upgrades, and a percentage of your unbanked money on death for a modest fee.\n\nThe problem with this aspect is that most of the upgrades just aren't worth their salt. Speed can be upgraded, but you already move like a crackhead. You can upgrade reload so that you mash in more bullets with each button press, but you can already reload as fast as you can push the button anyway. You can upgrade Bullet Magnet, but there's an item that does the same thing as having maximum rank in that stat, and it's pretty easy to find on each playthrough. The inventory system is a bit daft too, in that there really isn't one. You get to hold one item. That's it. This sounds pretty good in theory, especially for a roguelike, but in practice it means that you'll be ignoring just about every consumable you find because you found one item with a passive ability on it that turns you into a bullet god. Sure, you can upgrade your backpack to hold more items, but good luck saving up the 100 coins needed for that one, or having two items you want to store in the first place. In fact, why have a Bulletgod Relic and 3 consumable rockets when you could just have 2 Bulletgod Relics?\n\nReally though, the game's actually pretty decent and it's worth a pickup if you enjoy roguelikes and other stuff like Receiver or Tower of Guns, though it lacks the intricate gameplay setup of the former and the depth and complexity of the other. If you're not into that kind of thing, it's still probably worth kicking about whenever it goes on sale. It's fun, but flawed, and that's honestly not half bad.\n\nAnd it gets mad props for not using Early Access to act like a money-hoarding ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.","May 16, 2014","true","1.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fortheussr/recommended/297120/","fortheussr","chairbender","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fortheussr/","342 products in account","It's quite tense, atmospheric, and it feels good to play skillfully. Unfortunately, it has just enough problems that I wouldn't recommend it to someone.\n\nFirst of all, the entire gameplay through each of the levels is quite fun. It reminds of more of the type of shooting you would do in counterstrike as opposed to quake. It's all about peeking corners and out-reacting the enemies. Pretty much everything you can shoot gets destroyed in one hit, which makes the combat more satisfying and fast-paced.\n\nSometimes, an enemy will notice you before you notice it and utter a cry, giving you a warning and a bit of time to respond to it before it gets the drop on you. Those sort of situations are definitely fun because you actually know what you could've done differently if you take damage. It keeps you on your toes, too, because you're always trying to listen carefully for enemy cries. I think it adds to the tense atmosphere in a good way.\n\nOther times, however, you won't be able to get the enemies without completely leaving the corner and you'll have to strafe around the room trying to dodge the turrets and other enemies. The turrets' turning and shooting behavior is very unpredictable which makes these sort of forced situations very frustrating because there doesn't seem to really be a reliable strategy for dodging them. Furthermore, I found it very difficult to shoot while strafing in this game - it seemed like the game was always stuttering a lot when I was trying to do this, which is frustrating.\n\nAlso problematic, for a game that's all about aiming and shooting and lightning fast reflexes, it absolutely should not be having occasional lag/stuttering. Unfortunately, it has that and it seems to have it right when enemies are attacking me or coming into vision. It's not very freuqent, but it's enough to be annoying and mess up my concentration or ability to track what is going on enough to start taking damage. I am not alone in having this problem, so don't assume you're not going to have this issue either.\n\nFinally, the biggest issue that makes me not want to recommend the game is the difficulty spikes. Specifically, I'm talking about the level 4 and final bosses. The level 4 boss is ridiculously challenging and doesn't at all fit with the methodical, patient playstyle of the rest of the game. Going in blind, you're almost certainly going to just die in a few seconds. Further compounding this issue is that, once you die, you don't get to quickly try again to see how you could've improved (which would be a very satisfying game loop IMO). You have to then carefully plod your way back through the first four levels. I found myself getting impatient because I just wanted to have another go at the boss, and I would end up dying before reaching it because the game really requires a patient, methodical playstyle. This is, of course, highly frustrating, and it feels like the game is just trying to waste my time. It's like, I've already demonstrated I can handle the first stages, just let me go back to where I was at the edge of my abilities, where games are most engaging, dammit!\n\nThe final boss is even worse in this regard. It's absolutely overwhelming when you first encounter it - there's so many enemies, new elements, sounds, etc... that it's just impossible to make sense of it your first time. And you have to play through eight stages again to even get to try to understand the boss after you inevitably die. While you're playing through the stages, you're not really getting better against the boss either because you play through the stages with such a different playstyle than you would need to use against the boss.\n\nOverall, the game is intense, atmospheric, twitchy, and responsive (compared to the bullet-sponge type FPS gameplay in similar titles). If you like the sort of FPS gameplay in counter strike and are looking to spend a lot of time on mastering something like that, you may like this game. But if you're someone like me who just wants to have a fun gameplay experience, you probably will find this game more frustrating than fun because so much of your play time will be spent doing things that you already feel you've mastered.\n","November 6, 2014","false","6.5"," 36 of 64 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","36","64","0","0"

The garish art style may seem gimmicky, but in fact perfectly complements the vivid, nightmarish tension of hunting in The Highlands. In fact, the bizarre color palette and unusual enemy shapes serve an important purpose - to reset your perception and your ability to discern friend from foe. An experienced FPS player may welcome this departure from artisic norms as a means to retrain their reflexes, and those who love fast-paced FPS combat will find Heavy Bullets' frenzied bursts of action to be quite satisfying. The reusable ammo system adds a layer of skill and strategic depth while avoiding RNG-based ammo generation issues. Even sound is a critical element in the game, as different SFX help you predict enemy movements.\n\nSadly, Heavy Bullets suffers from highly repetitive level generation. At least half of the items in the game are fairly useless, and the same can be said for many of the upgrades and extra weaponry. Although not inherently bad, the player's bullets are not projectiles in the traditional sense - should your reticle center on an enemy's weak point, they will die the moment you squeeze the trigger, regardless of distance or movement. Additionally, enemy aggro relies heavily on line-of-sight, making it easy to pick off enemies one-by-one in most rooms. These atypical mechanics add to the quirkiness of the game, and feel very appropriate amongst the other design choices.\n\nHeavy Bullets is best-suited for roguelike fans, who will love the tension and atmosphere that it offers; however, it is possible that those who pick this game up for other reasons may find its permadeath and repetition a bit more of a grind than they can bear.","March 5, 2015","true","6.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This means that you need to move at max speed to pinpoint the spot and then pre-shoot after peeking from a wall. The game does have quick movement, but there are snakes hidden in the brushes that bite you if you come close, so you shan't move fast. Conflicting signals.\nAfter seeing a turret, it shoots at you within half a second, which means you'll lose HP even if you instantly shoot it.\nHaving snakes wait around 90° corners feels cheap (they rarely make a sound).\nThere's a "Repellent" item that supposedly repels snakes, but it just makes them more aggressive.\n\nYou start with 3 grenades and besides the bullets, it's the only item that doesn't occupy "the" item slot, so you'd assume that they're a core part of the game. Most of the game plays quickly, but the grenades fly slowly and the throw distance is abysmal (am I playing a T-Rex?).\n\nMost items use up that one item slot so you end up leaving lots of items behind.\n\nTechnically the game has no excuse why it doesn't run at a constant 120fps. There's hardly any geometry to render.\n\nBullets and coins on the floor make sounds and jump around, which makes it easy to pinpoint them and is useful early on, but it becomes a nuisance later when there are dozens of coins on the ground, which mask enemies in their noise.\n\nThe environment has no variety at all, which makes backtracking to a vending machine very confusing, as you can easily get lost in the repetitive rooms.\n\nThere are banks where you can drop off your gold so that you can use it in a future run.

This is one of those games that you either love or feel indifferent towards. It's really hard to hate. One thing that this game does that I think is interesting and refreshing is not explain many of the mechanics that are in the game. This might sound like a negative attribute, but what it really comes to feel like is that the game is treating you like an adventurer, or like an actual adult. You don't get spoonfed by this game in any tutorials or anything like that. Almost everything you find out in this game, you find out either on accident, or through experimentation (given that you don't read any guides beforehand, like I didn't). The gamefeel this creates is that of an older game, with more emphasis on exploring and item management over story or spectacle. One negative thing I found about the game, however, is that it becomes relatively easy once you've beaten it a few times and saved up a fair bit of money in your bank.

It is nice to see this in an indie game since the indie scene has been oversaturated with 2d pixel animated side scrollers. It is a good change of pace and makes me think of LSD dream emulator. One game i kept thinking of when i was playing this game was Receiver. Receiver is another game that does many things this one does. They are both 1st person roguelike games, they both have a polygon style and both force the player to manually reload.\nThis is where counting your shots comes in. You have an indicator in the bottom right corner of your screen that shows you how many bullets you have in the gun as opposed to just a number. This is important since the game only starts you out with six bullets. When you get into a fight you better be ready because they can be fast and only last a matter of seconds and if you miss your shots you better be ready to run, but with no ammo you're not completely out of luck though. The game allows you to pick up all bullets you have shot.This means unless you have a melee weapon you are going to have to dodge and weave past turrets and other enemies to get to the bullets you fired.\nTime to talk about the roguelike aspect of the game.Ugh, is it just me or am I tired of hearing roguelike lately. It has become a real selling point for games lately. Just slap on the roguelike sticker on it and its guaranteed to sell a few copies. Some do the roguelike better than others, so how does this game fair. Actually pretty good. Its nowhere near the best but it feels good and not just a way to give permadeath and have it lengthen the game. I mean it does lengthen the game but the challenge is good and the randomly generated items each time you play add quite the variation. It has a banking system that allows you to save money and items across playthroughs.\nSo you have only half a heart left and 100 coins, go put that money in the bank and make the next run easier. Storing items is also extremely useful to make it even easier.\nI actually want to take the time to talk about the Items. In the game you can only carry one item at a time, some have active effects such as the rocket and others have passive abilities such as the silver heat that allows one hit of damage without you getting hurt. It also breaks in half and falls to the ground after you get hit, no my broken heart. There are also items that you can sell at the bank and get even more coins. Some items are potions that will give you special powers such as a few seconds of bullet time or just heal you.There are also melee weapons you can get such as the knife and the pickaxe with will let you break rocks to get ore which you can sell.\nMy personal favorite item is the teleporter. It allows you to set a portal in a spot and at any time jump back to it instantly.\nThis game is a fun waste of time and for 10$ is well worth the price. I can’t wait till the game goes full release. I give it a 7.5 out of 10.","May 23, 2014","true","2.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With a colorful, neon design and blocky 3-D graphics, it's a pleasant break from all of the "retro" pixel games that have been coming out recently, so it's visually appealing as well.\n\nNow how is the gameplay? In Heavy Bullets, you are given a revolver with six slots. You can fire these six bullets and then pick them back up to reload into your gun. Sounds simple, but when enemies begin swarming you, you can quickly find yourself separated from your bullets, which are now all the way accross the room. The game itself is extremely challenging, though as you get accustomed to the controls and gameplay you can feel yourself improving. The gunplay is responsive, if a little finnicky at times and killing enemies is satisfying, as they explode into a cloud of coins and bullets.

You move extremely fast in this game, far faster than any other FPS I've ever played, and this means positioning yourself for strafing kills or aiming can be a challenge until you acclimate to the lightning speed you move at. Items are also a part of the game, but they too suffer from some flaws. Certain items are more useful than others, and some are even detrimental.

You are armed only with a Revolver, and you need to survive the 8 levels of the hunting grounds where various creatures and machines lie about to kill you. Your revolver can kill everything in one hit, and is 100% dead accurate. There's no bullet time travel, it instantly hits whatever you point at. You only have 6 bullets though, so you need to pick your bullet back up, and reload it back into your gun (Which is also instant with a press of the R key.)  Enemies will stop at nothing to chase you once they have you in your line of sight, but they drop coins which you can use to buy various items.\n\nMany items and stations exist to help you along the way. Lots of items are hidden throughout the floors, or locked away in doors that require keycards (Which you get from killing certain enemies), so you should do some searching around the area, you might find something good. You have items that bring up passive effects such as taking one hit without losing health, resistance to explosions, or a backpack for additional storage; or they can be weapon items such as mega bombs, mines, or rockets. Other items are handy tools. Speaking of storage, you can only hold one item at a time, so you need to make your choices carefully when you have to pick from 2 or more items, unless you have the backpack, then you can hold two items.\n\nThere are 3 stations: Banks are the most important ones. You can store your earned money into the bank for future use when you die, you can also store items in the bank for another run. You can withdrawl money from whatever you stored, and you can buy a last will, or life insurance which'll transfer a percentage of your money on-hand to the bank when you die. There is also the Medbay station for healing items, and Bullets (And Stuff) for weapons and other weird little items.\n\nThis game is permadeath, so if you die, you're sent all the way back to the beginning, but there is the Bank station to help you out on your next run. It kinda brings a thought of "should I store money in here now for better runs next time, or                    withdrawl some money from my current bank so I can have more help on this run?" Same thing does for storing items, too. It's a bit of decision making when you think about it, so be smart about what you do.\n\nIt's not an easy game, either. Everything (Besides immobile turrets) charge directly at you, and aren't afraid to get in your face. You need to make your shots carefully because you only have so many bullets before you have to reload, so accuracy is a must for surviving large encounters. That means don't freak out; keep a cool head. Making it all the way to level 8 and beating the boss will be quite the challenge.\n\nOverall, Heavy Bullets is a pretty unique rogue-like with it's fast paced nature of your insta-kill revolver, the metroidvania vibes of searching for items, and the strategic thinking of the bank and what items to bring with you. I think you'll find quite a bit of enjoyment out of it, and it's cheap too. It's something to try out sometime.\n\n7/10","April 11, 2015","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You die quick. Being too cautious when you need to be bold will get you killed, being too bold when you should be cautious will get you killed. Also you pick up your bullets after you shoot them. The future really is amazing.\n\n\n*Reloading is important but confined to a single button press, not like Receiver’s multi-step process, so don’t worry about trying to reload and instead ejecting your clip onto the floor as a monster chews off your face (even if that would be amazing)","June 20, 2014","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sure I can look forward to it- but never that excitement I'd feel when I was a kid and there was a new arcade game at our local dinner place, or when a new gameboy game happened to be released. Heavy Bullets gives me that excitement to play. Its fast paced, unforgiving, and often the hardest part of the game is not getting too full of yourself. One false move, and you suddenly are out of hearts. I'm thankful it doesn't cost quarters to play, otherwise I'd probably be on the street for the number of times I've replayed since purchasing.\n\nWith the vending machines and smart banking that carries over to new characters you can choose to play a few games and save, or go all out and buy all the upgrades.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/recommended/297120/","gamerrubrix","Gamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/","300 products in account","Heavy Bullets is a Rogue-Like FPS where you have one objective: Get to the end of the security mainframe to stop machines and creatures from killing the clients of your company, and yourself.\n\nIt's a very simple game. You are armed only with a Revolver, and you need to survive the 8 levels of the hunting grounds where various creatures and machines lie about to kill you. Your revolver can kill everything in one hit, and is 100% dead accurate. There's no bullet time travel, it instantly hits whatever you point at. You only have 6 bullets though, so you need to pick your bullet back up, and reload it back into your gun (Which is also instant with a press of the R key.)  Enemies will stop at nothing to chase you once they have you in your line of sight, but they drop coins which you can use to buy various items.\n\nMany items and stations exist to help you along the way. Lots of items are hidden throughout the floors, or locked away in doors that require keycards (Which you get from killing certain enemies), so you should do some searching around the area, you might find something good. You have items that bring up passive effects such as taking one hit without losing health, resistance to explosions, or a backpack for additional storage; or they can be weapon items such as mega bombs, mines, or rockets. Other items are handy tools. Speaking of storage, you can only hold one item at a time, so you need to make your choices carefully when you have to pick from 2 or more items, unless you have the backpack, then you can hold two items.\n\nThere are 3 stations: Banks are the most important ones. You can store your earned money into the bank for future use when you die, you can also store items in the bank for another run. You can withdrawl money from whatever you stored, and you can buy a last will, or life insurance which'll transfer a percentage of your money on-hand to the bank when you die. There is also the Medbay station for healing items, and Bullets (And Stuff) for weapons and other weird little items.\n\nThis game is permadeath, so if you die, you're sent all the way back to the beginning, but there is the Bank station to help you out on your next run. It kinda brings a thought of "should I store money in here now for better runs next time, or                    withdrawl some money from my current bank so I can have more help on this run?" Same thing does for storing items, too. It's a bit of decision making when you think about it, so be smart about what you do.\n\nIt's not an easy game, either. Everything (Besides immobile turrets) charge directly at you, and aren't afraid to get in your face. You need to make your shots carefully because you only have so many bullets before you have to reload, so accuracy is a must for surviving large encounters. That means don't freak out; keep a cool head. Making it all the way to level 8 and beating the boss will be quite the challenge.\n\nOverall, Heavy Bullets is a pretty unique rogue-like with it's fast paced nature of your insta-kill revolver, the metroidvania vibes of searching for items, and the strategic thinking of the bank and what items to bring with you. I think you'll find quite a bit of enjoyment out of it, and it's cheap too. It's something to try out sometime.\n\n7/10","April 11, 2015","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

At first all they do is run straight at you but as you progress through the game you encounter more and more advanced enemy types, for example: one enemy has armor and cannot be killed by just shooting at it it requires you to bait it to charge at you, afterwards you dodge its attack and shoot its weak spot on its rear. Its fun game mecanics like these that keep this game entertaining (though i only have played for a couple hours). I originally thought i would get bored very early on, but i found the games challenging difficulty making me want more (i guess i have been playng to much dark souls hehe). though i must say there are a few problems with the game even with the replayablilty there are only eight levels and when you purchase the game there is only one game mode. there is little to no story in heavy bullets whatsoever though given its gameplay theres not much to go off of. overall this game is alot of fun, its very challenging, has good music and smooth gameplay but with no story or other gamemodes to speak of its a little lacking, though for the price you can only get so much.

You've introduced a challenge into my life that is both infuriating and addicting. The sound design is excellent, and forces me to enjoy Doseone's fantastic work while I actively avoid snakeworms and try to find that last round I errantly fired in a panic. The use of simple enemies and principles used to slowly teach you the unforgiving nature of this world is expertly done. I'm only about 5 hours into this game as I write this, and I still haven't managed to get past  the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed turret boss on level 4. I thought I had him dead to rights in my second encounter, but I was immediately immobilized by a snare turret when I entered the room, and died in like a chump with a red potion still in my inventory. I relish the idea of dying here, as I continue to get tripped up on other randomly generated ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on the way up. This is what my lunch breaks have become: an infuriating catharsis in which I swear more in an hour than during the rest of my day combined. And I wish it could be longer.\n\nBottom line: This is a fantastic randomized game. Roguelike, roguelite, whatever you want to call it, Heavy Bullets delivers a challenge that is well worth the price of admission, and I can't wait to see what future updates hold.\n\nBut seriously, ♥♥♥♥ snakeworms.","June 16, 2014","true","8.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Armed with your trusty revolver and six bullets, you must fight your way through eight floors of a vibrantly colored and dangerous landscape, buying and finding small upgrades along the way. Each bullet you fire can be recovered and loaded back into your revolver, just make sure you remember to reload as the creatures you encounter are very quick about killing you. The music and sound design in Heavy Bullets is a definite highlight. The jungle ambiance of each room, the mechanical beeps of the turrets, the cries of vicious beasts that will hunt you down sound distinct and keep you immersed in the world of Heavy Bullets.

I would still recommend this game, because the first 4 levels were fine for me and gave me a lot of enjoyment, but you might want to wait for a sale. The lag on the last few stages makes it hard to enjoy, especially for a game that is heavily reliant on fast reactions and twitch shooting. However, I would say that the first 4-5 stages are a lot of fun, and I would say it is still probably worth buying if you get the game on sale.**\n\nIf you enjoy twitch shooters, difficult indie games, roguelikes or dungeon crawlers, I can't recommend Heavy Bullets more.\n\nI have not experienced any of the extreme lag others have said, but I do get the occasional stutter (maybe once or twice a floor) but that generally doesn't happen in combat and barely effects gameplay. **Edit: In the last few stages it rapidly increases makes the game almost unplayable. Be warned**\n\nEven if lag might be an issue, it's well worth buying it. You can see if you experience the lag and if you do you can easily refund it.\n\nNow, to the game:\n\nThe gameplay is addictive and fun. For games like this, a lot of the time I find myself getting bored and just being careless/running through quickly (looking at BOI). With this game, I find myself much more invested in each playthough,\n\nThere is a sense of progression - upgrades make a noticable effect and the further you get, the harder the enemies get, but also the more equipped you are to deal with them. There are 8 stages (it shows you every time you load the next stage) and I have only got to 4 so far, but I already feel determined to beat the game. It might take a while though.\n\nThere isn't much to learn in terms of items and enemies (again, not like BOI), so you generally don't feel cheated after you get used to the pacing of the game (and learn about the three main types of enemies - charging enemies, worms and turrets). None of the items you pick up can effect you negatively and most are pretty descriptive as to what they are, so you are never left thinking 'What does this item do?'\n\nThe randomly generated aspect of the game can be annoying at times (I'm assuming that is what causes the occasional stuttering?) with some places being out of reach, but it also gives the game insane replayability.\n\nThe biggest gripe I have with this game is the explosives. You start with three grenades, but you only do a tiny throw when you use them. This makes them basically useless. There are several explosive items in the game and I barely find myself using them. There is an item that lets you throw them further but it is fairly rare and when I find it I am normally carrying more useful items anyway.\n\nIn summary, if you are interested in this game and think you might like it, get it. I don't know about full price but it is definitely worth it on sale. If it tags too much, get a refund.","March 14","true","6.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kermamrek/recommended/297120/","kermamrek","Kerma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kermamrek/","289 products in account","Without a doubt, heavy bullets is probably the most stylistic "rogue-lite" (I refuse to call it a roguelike) on the market right now. Does that make it a good game?\n\nIn Heavy Bullets, you're basically playing a person whose goal is to do something about the security system, but honestly the story pretty much ends there. Other than some really strange flavour text that pops up whenever you start up the game, there's nothing else to the story other than you're going around shooting spiders and turrets.\n\nThe "music" (more like sound) and graphics are beautiful. I have heard some people complain about the colour palette, and while I sort of agree at some parts mainly I think it's pretty to look at and the sound fits perfectly. There's usually no soundtrack in the background unless you beat a level or walk up to a vending machine, which even then is only glitchy ambience instead of actual full on audio tracks. When you're almost dead, a intense drum beat starts playing which amps up the tenseness (is that a word?) of the game.\n\nThat's where my positives mainly end. While graphics and sound are a big part of this game, the other is the gameplay- which unfortunately is not spectacular. The picking up bullets mechanic is at first, very interesting and fun until you realize that you're either going to be stuck at basically swimming in bullets, or no bullets at all and no way to proceed (which is amplified even more by another thing that we'll get to later).\n\nBut what's wrong with the mechanic? Isn't the point that you get punished for bad aim, and that you have to risk your life to go grab more? That is all fine and dandy- until you realize that it forces the game to become a slow, methodical almost stealthing game rather than the fast "shoot or be killed" shooter that the game's movement speed and controls hint towards it wanting to be. Moving fast and shooting fast FEELS good, but you get punished for it so harshly by the enemy design and the nature of dropping bullets that you are forced to camp behind pillars and take your shots slowly- something that would work better for another game, but for the twitchy controls of Heavy Bullets it just feels like it bogs the game down to unplayable levels.\n\nIn turn, this all creates a loop of camping and inching to preserve bullets and then running out of bullets because you're camping, making you have to camp harder and be even more careful as you try and make a sneak attempt to the bullet you dropped, probably ending up in your death unless you got a bunch of health to camp with or bullet magnet+ to grab it from afar. Overall, I don't think that this mechanic is pulled off well mainly because the dangers that are presented to you are too high to make the game that fun "run-n-gun" game it wants to be so much.\n\nOther problems I have are more nitpick and personal preference- I honestly feel like the banking system kind of encourages grinding and money grubbing more than actually enjoying the game the first times through; although you don't have to play the game like this, and there's even an achievement for ignoring it altogether. I feel like also some of the items are death sentences, I've never used running shoes without me running into a snake and killing myself and bombs seem like they're kind of on the useless side of weaponry even though you get a lot which ends up balancing them out somewhat.\n\nSo, do I recommend it? Well, if it's on sale as it currently is for 2 dollars, I'd recommend it just for the graphical and audial experience, but otherwise I'd say no. The trailer of popular LPers screaming at snakes attacking them is basically all this game boils down to- being killed by hidden things as you camp in corners trying to hold onto your bullets.\n\nTL;DR: Heavy Bullets is an extremely pretty game game that adds a few innovative features, but squanders them by wanting to be both a slow stealth-like game and a fast run-n-gun, making your twitch based controls and movement basically useless as you inch around levels hoping a snake or turret doesn't kill you around a corner as you camp behind pillars. Get on sale for the graphics/audio, avoid on non-sale price because the gameplay is kind of bad.\n\n5/10","April 25, 2015","false","0.6"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","1"

Mook enemies die in one hit, so it's mostly a game of reflexes, but you still won't get very far if you Leeroy Jenkins your way forward instead of taking the time to properly approach unexplored areas.\n\nVery simple and fun, certainly worth a try.","April 13, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Very simple at its core.\n+ Procedural generation really does make every play unique.\n+ Enemy AIs feel well balanced.\n+ The atmosphere has just the right amount of unnervingly odd.\n+ The RNG plays a moderate role neither too powerful nor too arbitrary.\n+ The concept of scarce but retreivable bullets plays a well-executed and very central role.\n\n~ Meta-progression involves placing your money into a bank account that carries between runs. Whether or not this will help your future runs depends on what "shops" you can find.\n~ No stats in the traditional roguelike sense.\n~ The graphics appear to be an intentionally low-res style, from low poly count to low quality shadow rendering. At least it's not quite some recycled ~muy retro 8-bit~ garbage.\n~ Looks like it might be a bit short.

Those few runs were very, very short, brutal and frustrating, until I understood that this roguelike FPS had a depth to it that belied it's simplistic polygonal graphics and LSD-inspired color palette.\n\nIt took me those first few runs to realize that sprinting in guns blazing is not an approach that pays off here. Instead, you creep forward, peeking around corners to catch a glimpse of an enemy turret's weak spot, or one of those dastardly worms hiding almost in plain sight in the undergrowth.\n\nYou hear the bark of an imp that you know is coming screaming towards you at speed, but you haven't got a bead on which direction it's coming from yet. You spin, spot the imp that's right on top of you and squeeze off a single round, all in the blink of an eye. You know that there's a medbay a little ways back, but you also know that you're going to have to press onward to find the money to buy the heal you so desperately need.\n\nHeavy Bullets is *tense*, and it rewards your patience, care and attention to detail. It puts finely calibrated constraints on  every aspect of the game, from your limited titular bullets (a mere six rounds) that you can pick back up off the ground where they fall, to the single-item inventory that has you wondering whether you should have left that armor pickup and taken the megabomb instead. The powerups available for purchase are similarly well balanced, with you never quite sure that you made the right choice. Should you have bought the life insurance that will carry forward some of your money into your next run, or gone hell-for-leather and stocked up on a bigger inventory and a pocketful of rockets?","November 9, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The 80's neon aesthetic along with the blips, bloops, and 8-bit electronica really complement the retro genre. Mechanics like the bullet recycling and the cross-playthrough banking system are fairly original and pretty damn genius.\n\nThe gameplay difficulty is just right too; hard enough that it's not at all a breeze, easy enough that you won't rage (too much). A lot of how you do is based on luck, but it only makes it that much more rewarding when you stumble upon some extra health potions or treasure. Good reflexes are key to making it out alive. Each playthrough makes you learn from your mistakes, making the next run that much easier.\n\nEnemies are nicely varied, each requiring a seperate approach and strategy to fight. There is a plethora of items to use, ranging from the absolutely necessary to the down-right silly (most notably the high heels).\n\nThe randomly generated levels may be constructed from recognizable template layouts, but still manages to make the encounter around the next corner unpredictable. Enemy placement is also randomized, but not unfairly so (i.e. you won't open a door to find a turret in your face).\n\nAs far as what can be improved upon, as this is an early access game, a co-op or even multiplayer mode with friends would be really fun. Some AI behavior could use some tweaking, but none of it is detrimental to gameplay.\n\nIn conclusion, GET THIS FREAKIN GAME.

That's what this game says and it's what you'll say after playing this game. This simple (and incredibly small) shooter is definitely worth a purchase. Here's why:\n- Simple, in build and in gameplay: Take away all the complicated controls and randomized gameplay elements in favour of concrete gameplay and exceptional playability\n- Small: This game is less than 100MB, even better than that it runs on next to nothing memory wise!\n- Fun: There's plenty of secrets, items, upgrades and options for playing this game. If you'd rather be a fast gunslinger then all power to you! Invest in run speed and extra bullets. If you prefer a calmer approach then improve your bullet magnet and get some extra health!\n\nThere's very little I don't like about the game, just one thing is there's a extra anti-aliasing option that seems to draw very excesssively on performance and for some reason reduced the overall look by a considerable amount. I also think the proceduraly generated thing is a bit of a gimmick because it seems moreso that rooms are randomly selected and given small changes to the walls without much else being different.\n\nRegardless, the challenge you face, along with an excellent soundtrack incline me to score this game quite highly, but small drawbacks are going to push my overall rating down to a humble 7.5/10\n\nIn conclusion, worth the $10, but still far from being "endlessly entertaining" as the concept sugggests. As the game gets updates though, I expect this game to easily reach above the score I gave it here.","July 3, 2014","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The 80's neon aesthetic along with the blips, bloops, and 8-bit electronica really complement the retro genre. Mechanics like the bullet recycling and the cross-playthrough banking system are fairly original and pretty damn genius.\n\nThe gameplay difficulty is just right too; hard enough that it's not at all a breeze, easy enough that you won't rage (too much). A lot of how you do is based on luck, but it only makes it that much more rewarding when you stumble upon some extra health potions or treasure. Good reflexes are key to making it out alive. Each playthrough makes you learn from your mistakes, making the next run that much easier.\n\nEnemies are nicely varied, each requiring a seperate approach and strategy to fight. There is a plethora of items to use, ranging from the absolutely necessary to the down-right silly (most notably the high heels).\n\nThe randomly generated levels may be constructed from recognizable template layouts, but still manages to make the encounter around the next corner unpredictable. Enemy placement is also randomized, but not unfairly so (i.e. you won't open a door to find a turret in your face).\n\nAs far as what can be improved upon, as this is an early access game, a co-op or even multiplayer mode with friends would be really fun. Some AI behavior could use some tweaking, but none of it is detrimental to gameplay.\n\nIn conclusion, GET THIS FREAKIN GAME. Creator Terri Vellmann really did a bang-up job with Heavy Bullets, and I can only see it getting better.","July 7, 2014","true","18.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I keep coming back to both of them.\n\nHowever, Heavy Bullets is bright, and simple, and teeming with life, where Receiver is monotone in color, byzantine in keybindings, and thematically devoid of life.

Receiver has little more than it's story, but there isn't really an end to the gameplay.\n\nAnd I love them both for all of those reasons.\n\nI have a feeling Receiver is the game I'll return to in the long run, not strictly the better game, but there it is.\n\nBut Heavy Bullets: "A+++ wuld shoot again!!!!"","May 7, 2015","true","11.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

The game is not filled with tons of random items just so the developer can say in the trailers that the game has 100+ items from which half do the same thing anyway and the other half is totally useless. Still, there are 1 or 2 useless items in this game and maybe some more items or at least character upgrades would make it more rewarding. With Character upgrades btw I mean that there are items in the game which permanently increase something from your character, for example you can reload more bullets at once or you can run faster.\nThe second reason I like this game is that exploration is worth it and will be rewarded. The levels are designed like mazes, kinda like in Doom, but everything is on the same height. There are also secrets, but they are very rare and I think there is only type of secret (maybe I simply didnt found other types).\nThe third reason is the enemy design. Every level you get one or two new enemy types to fight and every enemy has a distinct role, look and is defeated with a different tactic. Most enemys die in 1 hit and thats a nice thing because first it makes you feel powerful, second this is a game which rewards quick reaction and reflex (like Counter-Strike). Also when enemys die they kinda explode which is nice hit feedback.\nAnd the last reason is the presentation of the game which is very cool and consistent. Obviously the game looks "bad" because technically its very low quality, but it knows how to present itself. I really like the main menu. Also sound-design is good in the sense that everything has a distinct sound. For example coins and bullets you can collect dont just stay on the ground, they sometimes bounce a little and make a sound so you always know that there is something you forgot to pick up.\nThe only reason I said that this is only worth at sale price is because it is very short, it depends on your skill. I played a little over 2 hours and beat the final boss. I know many people probably think the Bank is a good design choice, but in my opinion its just a cheat, so at some point everyone will finish this game. This could easily be fixed by limiting the amount available of an item at one vending machine, but you can currently just upgrade carry+ and then take tons of red potions and silver hearts with you. I paid 1,5€ on a Sale for this game and for that price it was a very solid experience and made me write a review even if this game is already old.\nWhat I can definitly say is that the developer of this game (which I believe is a single person?) is definitly a good game designer and I wish him the best of luck.\n","April 25, 2015","true","3.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The art direction for this game is without a doubt pretty unique to this era, it's something we've really not seen a lot of sine the early 90's.\n\nThe gameplay is to be expected from a first person shooter, it's fast, precise and simple without any unecessary features or buttons. The reload and ammo feature in this game must be its strongest feature by far, as it stops you from conserving or scavenging for ammo. The vendor machines that are scattered around also contain some nifty perks, upgrades and items for you to use and they will save your life when you're in dire need.\n\nThe roguelike elements compliment the game nicely, it keeps it all fresh and exciting so that you won't get burnt out by it. It has more or less everything you're looking for in a roguelike inspired game; permanent death, procedurally generated content, randomized monsters and items, high difficulty and so on.\n\nThe only negative I personally can say about this game so far is that it needs more content. It's currently an Early Access Game so hopefully the developer takes this to mind while working on it. More weapons, perks monsters, traps, items and rooms/areas would certainly help the longevity of the game.\n\nIf you're into roguelike inspired games, just want something new and unique or if you're into games like: Tower of Guns, Rogue Shooter, Black Ice, Paranautical Activity, Fancy Skulls, Eldritch or Delver then I'd highly recommend Heavy Bullets. It's a fun little indie game with a lot of charm and I'm really looking forward to see where the developer takes it further down the road.","May 25, 2014","true","2.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The first thing that sets it apart from other ego shooter are the visuals. Everything is made of simple shapes and high contrast colours and shadows, combined with a sightly glitchy image filter layer over it.\n\nThe levels are short, the tempo and difficulty are high. You don’t have that much health and ammo and every corner bares the risk of dying. It’s fast and thrilling. The levels are randomly generated with every new play through. There are a couple of enemies and different items, which can be found in levels or bought at vending machines. I haven’t played it long enough, but there seems to be quite some depth buried behind the simple mechanics.\n\nHeavy Bullets reminded me of Superhot or Eldritch in a lot of ways. Glitchy or retro graphics, fast gameplay, short levels, high stakes, many deaths. There seems to be a trend in indie games for highly polished shooters that take lots of inspiration from classic skill based shooters combined with a polished gameplay and unique visuals. And it’s starting to make me like shooters again.","June 14, 2014","true","9.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It succeeds as far as atmosphere goes, especially on a sound design level. It's retro chip-tune design feels threatening in an almost abstract sense, with some hidden monsters in the grass only being given away by the little blip noises they make, though of course you also have sounds to signal uncollected items and jaunty tunes to tell you a kiosk to make purchases is nearby. It's a really terrific use of sound design to fill in the visual holes.\n\nGameplay wise, the hook is gripping. Instead of collecting masses of bullets like most FPS's, you have to make due with a limited number of bullets that can be recovered after battle, and only one kind of gun. You can also collect bombs, but run out of both and you're basically done for. The problem I have is that there's really only one strategy for each fight; run out, listen for enemies, run back, wait for them to follow you around a corner, dispatch them, then poke your head back out and deal with turrets carefully. It's possibly an inherent flaw with smushing rogue-likes and FPS's together, since the former is based on randomization and making due with what you have and the latter is much more dependent on strong level design. I feel a lot of those flaws could be compensated for with stronger RPG elements, but leveling up is so far not that involved. You can buy or acquire more bullets, upgrade health, purchases a backpack to carry more than just one item, and of course find items that make you run faster, heal, or give you a melee attack. But in a game called "Heavy Bullets" there's no way to upgrade your gun or your bullets. Certainly I'm sure a lot of this has to do with the game's creator being a single individual, but I wonder if scaling down to a top-down shooter or even just making it a survival arena shooter and focusing on the gunplay wouldn't have made for a better game.\n\nIn any case this is by no means a bad game, so give it a try yourself, and I'll keep chipping at it to see if there's more depth than is immediately apparent.","March 28, 2015","false","1.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Check into some gameplay videos with it. It's a dungeon roguelike game that is randomly generated. It gets harder and harder as you go along. It's definietly a game that tests your reflexes, or at least that's what I gather. I enjoy it a lot and actually did begin to feel sympathy for the imps whenever I progressed through the game.\n\nWith all this being said I would recommend this game because I can definitely see myself putting more horus into it because I haven't beaten the final boss and I think that it is reasonably priced.","November 28, 2014","true","6.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

As you progress you fight various strange enemies who attack in either the most basic or most dastardly ways possible. The most basic enemy is an imp with huge teeth which just runs in straight lines to get to you and bite your face off. Imps won't dodge, won't curve paths, make loud noises to warn you, and won't stop chasing you except to rotate X amount of degrees when confronted with a corner; so they're boring, a nuisance instead of a threat, and lame. Another simple enemy is the turret. You encounter a number of laser shooting turrets which are either easy or hard based on how many other turrets are around, because they all fire fast and have to be hit in a specific location. If there's only one or two it's a bit of a cakewalk if you aim right. Otherwise they'll light you up if there's more. Conversely, there's also snakes which hide in the dense foliage, waiting for you to get close to leap out and posion you. Snakes are usually hidden well, quiet, and often manage to leave a lasting poison which I've had take off three hearts of health before (important note here is that you start with 3 hearts and I only ever maxed out at 5 hearts) so a cheap enemy is one of the biggest threats. Then there's my favorite of the game's many FU's. The living bomb bug. You get suicide rushed by small purple bugs that zoom at you like they're trying to win the ♥♥♥♥ing Indy 500 race so it can do a large AOE blast which does a full heart of damage and seems to stun you briefly. Remember, you only start with 3 hearts, slow movement for an FPS, and everything is overgrown and neon colors, so it's a HUGE THREAT. So, basically the enemy design sucks both for the player's survival, and for the player's lasting interest in playing at all, because they are so uninspired and have limited AI.\n\nContinuing with gameplay feedback; there are a number of items in game to pickup, similar to say, The Binding of Isaac, where there's both "use" items and "passive" items. Unlike BoI however, you can only carry 1 or 2 items total in Heavy Bullets depending on whether or not you bought a backpack. There's a good variety in items, though most aren't as helpful as they should be. For instance, there's a "use" item called the Ritual Knife, which deals the player a heart of damage and used to give you as many coins as you would need to buy a heart on that floor, but now jips you a few coins. Another such neutered item is the "passive" Repelent, which claims to repel bugs and snakes, which would be so great if it actually did so. Instead the repelent only gives the player an extra secind before they attack. So, snakes and bomb bugs will still ruin your fun constantly anyway. The items that actually are good with no downside don't have a big payoff, so there's no full heal just minor, the antidote only cures poison for one instance of poison, and there's no lasting buffs- just ones that last a few seconds. So items play a smaller role than they typically do in this type of game.\n\nAs far as lasting thoughts, I felt like it was a game that would have been a gem had it been made in the 90's, as a lot of the ideas would have been fresher and more appreciable then. Rogue-lite's weren't really a trend back then, and the randomized dungeons would have been novel. The visuals are really basic, but 3d games usually were in the 90's. The music was not really very inspired, and should have played a lot more. Sound effects were quite bad. It's hard to get to like a big gun that makes a small "boof" noise, creatures sounded as robotic as the turrets, and everything sounded like it came through a bad chipset with a damaged speaker. I think the character was supposed to occasionally say things like "Oh yeah!" and "Whew!" but it sounded like the sound desginer(s?) burped and farted into a mic or attempted to go for 80's level synthization. All those sound issues would be easier to overlook in the 90's when it was harder and often expensive to get good sound in videogames, but here it's off-putting now.\n\nOverall, a dissapointment on many fronts. I love FPS'es, Roguelites, and games with some style, but this let me down in every cateogory. Things just don't meld well in this game, and the existing content is rudimentary and unfun. 4/10.\nIf you want a good example of an FPS/Roguelite which delivered where this game failed, I suggest Eldritch or Ziggurat. Eldritch has more stealth, adventure, and horror elements complemented by immersive sound design. Ziggurat provides better FPS movement, more interesting items, weapons, enemies, and impressive visual flair.","August 22, 2015","false","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's hard to get to like a big gun that makes a small "boof" noise, creatures sounded as robotic as the turrets, and everything sounded like it came through a bad chipset with a damaged speaker. I think the character was supposed to occasionally say things like "Oh yeah!" and "Whew!" but it sounded like the sound desginer(s?) burped and farted into a mic or attempted to go for 80's level synthization. All those sound issues would be easier to overlook in the 90's when it was harder and often expensive to get good sound in videogames, but here it's off-putting now.\n\nOverall, a dissapointment on many fronts. I love FPS'es, Roguelites, and games with some style, but this let me down in every cateogory. Things just don't meld well in this game, and the existing content is rudimentary and unfun. 4/10.\nIf you want a good example of an FPS/Roguelite which delivered where this game failed, I suggest Eldritch or Ziggurat. Eldritch has more stealth, adventure, and horror elements complemented by immersive sound design. Ziggurat provides better FPS movement, more interesting items, weapons, enemies, and impressive visual flair.","August 22, 2015","false","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/297120/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","This game is perfectly fine. It's a good randomly-generated dungeon crawler with accuracy-based shooting and a fast pace. Everything dies in one hit except you. The core concepts are all fine, there's a lot of beneficial items to pick up but it never feels like you're screwed if you don't get good items or shop spawns. The sound design is interesting and sounds become a very important part of the game fairly quickly. Personally I felt the game got a bit monotonous after a bit though, a lot of the same enemies and the same scenery (at least as far as I got, that is).\n\nUnfortunately, no matter how good the game is, it just seems roguelikes are a hopeless genre to me, especially ones as close to pure roguelike as this one (sans the banking system, which I barely needed to use). It's fun at its core but I like making progress, not getting stuck because I can't figure out how to beat the boss that doesn't show up until 15+ plus into the game and there's no way for me to practice it otherwise. It's not the fault of the game, as much as it is just my personal preference, but if didn't enjoy this roguelike I'm not going to enjoy any of them. Gonna stick to rogue-lites from now, yep.","August 6, 2015","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In the resolution options there is the resolution you are using followed by buttons to change it, something like that: - 1280x1024 +     (- and + are the buttons), 1280x1024 is the maximum resolution I can get (my monitor is small ._.') and the minimum is 640x480. So you expect that if you are in 1280x1024 and press the "+" button you should go to 640x480, right? Well, no, you go to other random resolutions like 1280x768, which is not even close to 1280x1024.\nIf the resolution problems ended here, it would be acceptable, but they don't. As I said, the native res. of my monitor is 1280x1024, so I should use that res. to play the game. But even by using that resolution some parts of the game are cut off the screen, like the title in the menus and other things...\n\nThis game is bad optimized as ♥♥♥♥, I play a lot of heavier games than this one and it still lags constantly (freezes the screen for ~0,20 seconds). I can't play with that, if a monster charges at you and you lag, you will be hit, and that is unacceptable in a game with permadeath.\n\nOther than bugs, this game will get boring quite fast, and it don't have much content.\n\nI got it on a sale, and honestly, my MP7 | Urban Hazard Stat Trak was way better than this game.\n","May 4, 2015","false","2.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Heavy Bullets feels bland and monotonous compared to games like Tower of Guns and Ziggurat. Perhaps it's the single weapon, perhaps it's the lack of enemy variety. It may be the extremely basic and unappealing graphics; I can't quite put my finger on what makes Heavy Bullets so boring in such a short amount of time, although I suspect it's a bit of all of those things.\n\nIn any case, as mentioned above, buy Ziggurat or Tower of Guns instead; they are much better games.","November 13, 2014","false","1.6"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","5","16","0","0"

The shooting and re-usable bullets mechanics are not great in my experience, I would have preferred more variety. The bombs that you can throw are very hard to hit anything with and generally seem useless, so you're just going to be sticking with the revolver for the majority of the game. Items might be interesting, but I have no idea what any of it does. Some are self-explanatory, but what does a golden skull do? I just played a run through with one, and I have no idea what it did, if anything, because the game makes no attempt to tell you. I don't need to be spoon fed, but at the same time I do need information if I am to understand what stuff does. So I picked up some repellant, what does it repell? You can't test it by hanging around the various enemies, because you will end up getting yourself killed, and the game doesn't tell you one way or another.\n\nThe ease at which you can get screwed over by the game is not balanced with enjoyable game play, in my opinion. Stressful, tense game play is welcome, but there aren't any "♥♥♥♥ yeah" moments, no moments of "that thing I just did was awesome" to balance it out. There are also technical issues, if you are considering buying this game check the forums before you do. Currently (and for a while now) there is a bug causing really bad frame skips that can really screw you over if you happen to be trying to shoot something at the time. The aiming reticule is also not locked to the centre of the screen so it jiggles, and for some users wanders quite far from the centre making it hard to be accurate.\n\nIt's not a bad game by any stretch of the imagination, and maybe on sale it's worth a look but I can't recommend it in all honesty.","November 19, 2014","false","3.7"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

With that setup, Heavy Bullets made me motion sick. That never happens to me.

If you play games with a mouse and keyboard on a monitor rather than a TV, your experience will probably be different from mine, but I cannot recommend Heavy Bullets in its current form with my setup.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rokinath/recommended/297120/","rokinath","Rokinath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rokinath/","269 products in account","This is a pretty intriguing game as it takes some ideals from roguelikes (i.e randomly generated levels & permadeath) and puts them into a FPS enviroment. The catch? You have only 6 bullets for your gun - fortunately these are the titular 'Heavy Bullets' and once discharged can be picked up and used again.\n\nDon't think for a second the game is easy, though. As you might expect from a game with roguelike elements, your character is pretty flimsy, and each room usually contains about 2-4 enemies; with your finite bullets this prompts a steady yet swift aim to kill them. The enemy type themselves are few but they each have their own behaviours and traits to get used to and new enemies are met in later floors. Speaking of, there's 8 floors in total, with a boss at the halfway mark at then a climatic boss on the final floor (of course).\n\nAlong the way you might come across vending machines to aid you and depending on what kind of vendor they are they will sell you health potions, extra bullets and... your last will (like you needed to be further convinced this is a game you won't complete in one run). Alternatively, you might get a keycard to access an otherwise locked off room, which will provide an item (or occasionally a powerup) to further assist you.\n\nGraphically the game looks unique. It looks somewhat chunky and uses some vibrant colours; predominantly pink and purple, there's flashes of cyan, green and silver too. The bold visuals, in my opinion, contribute to the tension aswell, as it makes the enviroment feel alien and hostile. Combine that with the synthetic sounding warblings of your character and that of enemies, it feels like you're playing in one hell of a fever dream.\n\nIn closing, Heavy Bullets manages to provide an incredibly tense experience due its titular mechanic - its not so much a case of ammo conservation, more a case of good marksmanship under pressure (read: having 3-4 enemies chasing after you). The graphics and sound too will help you get immersed in this neon hell, but overcoming its trials is a deeply satisfying experience.","October 6, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Defeated enemies drop coins which you can use to purchase items and upgrade yourself with, but once you die...you die, this is a permadeath game and defeat means restarting again from level one, however you can boost your next playthrough by depositing surplus coins in the previous life at banking terminals randomly placed in each level. Levels and enemies are also randomly generated, so there's no chance of gaining the advantage by learning the corners and hiding places, you have to be alert at all times, and even when you feel completely confident in yourself, something unforseen will usually spring out of nowhere and put you in your place. The more you advance, the more you stand to lose, can you reach the final level? (I certainly havn't...yet). Love this game, you might too.","December 13, 2014","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You start with a revolver and 6 bullets (this is where the "heavy" part comes in) and you are forced to pick them up after you shoot them. It's fun, it's colorful, it's just so cool!

You usually learn lessons the hard way, but the smart design ensures you come across each problem one at a time; at the same time this design encourages careful, precise play over guns-blazing tactics. 10 hours in, I still don't know exactly what's going to be around each corner, but I do know that usually the best option is to keep my eyes and ears open, aim true, reload often, and shoot sparingly. The feeling of learning the game is highly rewarding.\n\nHeavy Bullets punishes mistakes hard, but it does well to alleviate frustrations with some neat twists. The ability to save money across playthroughs ensures that each inevitable failed attempt doesn't have to feel like a waste. Keycards, vendors and items, each as randomised as the rest of the levels, encourage different tactics and using whatever's on hand to your advantage.\n\nAs of this date, there is one significant negative holding the game back. Many users including myself have experienced regular yet unpredictable microstutters during gameplay. In a game so tightly based around reaction time and precision, it can be positively maddening to drop hearts or even die from losing a much-needed split-second to the game's lag. While the game is by no means unplayable or unbeatable when played this way, several users have refused to play the game until this issue is resolved, and considering the type of game this is, I can't entirely blame them.\n\nOther than that, once the initial hurdles are overcome you'll find the game isn't particularly long, and I don't see myself returning to it once I beat this final level at last. The graphics are simple but clear and easy to look at, and it looks smooth enough at 60fps, the aforementioned stutters notwithstanding. The audio is punchy and fitting with the style of the game, if not particularly catchy. As I've said, it's a simple game, but it delivers a tighter experience than so many games much more complex than it. Overall, a highly respectable diversion.","May 8, 2015","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My friends recommended it to me, and at first, I thought it would just be a simple fps dungeon-like game. However, it is very fun and very addicting. You are able to pick up every bullet you fire, but must reload each bullet individually. Enemies drop money, which is used to purchase items, weapons, gear, and medical supplies at various vending machines scattered arond the randomly-generated maze. There is also a banking system. You can deposit money into a bank machine, and withdraw it if you die and restart. This aspect adds a bit of strategy to the game. You must decide if you should spend all of your cash right away, or deposit some in case things go wrong. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a stylish, fast-paced, arcade shooter, that gives off a very nostalgic vibe.","April 25, 2015","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I LOVE this game.  It's a first-person shooter, if you're into that sort of thing, with a semi permi-death thing going on.  It's rogue-like, and it has some gnarly colors (a good thing).  The soundtrack is sparse and electric, but pumping at times, which is surprisingly effective--it's quiet at times, but then it rolls up from the background almost like it knows things are going to get rough.\n\nThe enemies are a mix of almost trivially easy and ridiculously hard, though you won't see the hard ones for a handful of levels.  Everything except the bosses dies with one hit, which is good, but you're still going to have trouble, especially when confronted by groups, or when you have to hit a weak point.\n\nYou're forced to rely on items and upgrades, which is a pretty neat system, except that you'll lose them if you die, in all but a handful of circumstances; that could be a dealbreaker for some, and a challenge for others.  To say more would be giving away too much.\n\nIf I had to find flaws with the game, there are two big ones:\n\n- It gets annoying pretty quick when you die over and over on the same boss, which can be hard enough to the point where your beating it is largely luck.  Should you actually beat it, and die later, you're stuck starting from the very beginning.  It's a near rage-quit.  In the same vein, sometimes your items will save from one game to the next (the result of an item), but sometimes they won't, despite having that item.\n\n- The bigger problem for me is the frame drops.  It's not a terribly demanding game, and I have a decent system, yet, whenever I play (and I always have Steam's frame rate counter running), there are multiple times where the game will drop from 60 FPS (you can change this in the settings) to ~52 or 53 FPS.  It seems slight, but when you're playing a twitchy game like this, and the frame drop causes you to get snagged by an enemy, (and it happens ALL THE TIME, enemy on the screen or not), it's enough to really ♥♥♥♥ you off.  I've tried all the different permutations in the settings:  FPS caps on/off, shadows/vsync on/off, FXAA on/off...you name it, I've messed with it.  No change.  It's always just enough of a drop to screw you.\n\nAll in all, I give it a 7.5/10.  Worth the price, absolutely.  Fix the frame drops, and I'd give it a 9/10.","April 18, 2015","true","22.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Randomized labyrinth has you wondering if the next corner revelas another shop while you regret not reloading facing the laser to your face.

I'm the 60th guy to beat it, if I can believe the leaderboards. Took me over 12 hours of experience-gathering to get this good with this awesome game.\n\nWell done 1st person shooter roguelike with Devolver-worthy art style. FOV adjustable up to 120° (which is how I played it). Has all the necessary options for regular PCs. It's worth the 7.5€ full price, you don't have to wait for a sale.\n\nIn a way, it's a bit a Deus Ex experience except there's no story-points in the game and no story-branching. But otherwise, you have the looting, have to intelligently make use of the available objects (and meager inventory space), and you have a wee bit of open world / hub experience because you can go back at least on the same level (of which there are 8 - each randomly assembled) to make use of vending machines and dropped objects, and getting back can be tricky because doors are harmfully laser-protected if you advance too far beyond them (towards the end of the level), but sometimes there are two doors leading the same way, so just open one on the way in, then open the other on the way back to fetch stuff. You can also just walk through the lasers, which costs half a heart - this can strategically make sense. Comparing it directly to Deus Ex is of course bu11sh!t, DX is a whole different ballpark, but in a very metaphorical way you have the same kind of game freedom / action going on.","October 3, 2014","true","41.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I must say, I got more than my money's worth and the full price should be right on the money with this one.\n\nNot much to say about the game that wasn't already on the store page. It's intense, colourful, playful and fun. You'll need decent reaction times and a good aim to deal with the enemies, as well as a keen eye to spot the kinds that like to hide in the environment. Levels are randomly combines, though you'll probably recognize some of the rooms from your previous playthroughs (this happened to me once in 70 minutes of gameplay). Ammo collection mechanic makes every encounter meaningful, the items you can get offer different approaches to a variety of situations and the banking system allows you to have your more casual playthroughs contribute as increased resources for the playthrough you try to beat the game on.\n\nOne complaint is the cheap death I got in the first boss fight: I had no idea what I might be facing, and there was very little time to react once the door opened. This is pretty standard in the genre though, and my first encounter did give me enough info to know what to do the next time, so that's not so big of a deal.\n\nIf the game looks fun, buy and enjoy!","November 11, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In no way shape or form should you rush through this even though the walking *cough* running pace is fast...I believe it should be toned down. The bosses are simple, yet difficult being only two. After beating it once I still find myself creeping around corners room clearing as I have every upgrade the shopping stalls have offered me (it's random what you get). Enemies have a good balance and are actually seemingly well placed in a randomly generated room clearing game. You get a balance of melee enemies, ranged enemies, and flying/ground enemies that can be ranged or melee. You also get that random Muslim that's oddly pink and charges you just to suicide bomb you....The second I see that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I can hear it now....JIHAD, ALLAH AKABAR! ***Modders get on it, I want pink little ball creatures that scream Islam nonsense at me.***\n\n9/10 Would play FPS dark souls again.

Especially if youi're a fan of Rogue-likes!\n\nWhy should I buy this game?\n-Its a procedurally-generated level system, meaning, everytime you play, the levels change! You never know what to expect\n-It's really exciting - theres enemies around every corner so you gotta be super careful and peek around. Survival gaming at its greatest.\n-It's super hard - but fair! Every enemy gives fair warning, so if you die, its either because you got careless, went too fast or wasn't prepared. So it makes you want to try again and again! Great replayability!\n-You can grind to victory! In a sense. You can deposit the cash you collect in the bank for future runs, allowing you rack up a ton of cash for use right from the start!\n-Design is super-unique! Apart from (and I'm stretching it here) Hotline Miami and Far Cry Blood Dragon, you won't find this neon retro style. The stark color contrast also makes things pop out, which is good for gameplay, such as the bright weak spots of enemies.\n-Music and sound are all top-notch! The music picks up whenever theres enemies around - a nice jungle battle theme - than dies down when everything's dead. The sound effects are all delightfully (in my opinion) retro and the enemy popping (yes they pop in pieces, like Lego) sounds in particular are very satisfying.\n\nWhat's not so good?\n-Its nail-bitingly difficult. You can only take a few hits, and enemies hit FAST and UNEXPECTEDLY. Within a minute of your first playthrough you'll be left with 1/2 of a heart left, gasping and cringing at the low-health sound. Then, you'll reach the first boss and possibly destroy your controller as he destroys you in a split-second. Which is a good point for some, a bad point for others. I personally find it a tad bit TOO DIFFICULT.\n-There's not that many enemies in the game really, but there's enough and their placement always changes.\n-Can be confusing for new players. It was complicated to configure the xbox controller - it isn't automatic. There's no tutorial. You'll suicide by accidentally throwing a bomb. Enemies look like the rocks and bushes. In stores, it doesn't say what things do. You just gotta try it out and figure it out on your own.\n-The game isn't terribly balanced. Some items are awesome, but most are terrible to useless. Most players will have to resort to stocking one particular item in the bank and ALWAYS USING THE SAME THING. That's kinda sad.\n\nCan't really think of any real faults in the game other than that. Its just perfect at what it does, so it doesn't need to be overly ambitious like GTA V.\n\nBest way to enjoy this game is playing on the couch with friends and watching them squirm as they go through the labyrinth! Pop open those beers! Drink everytime he gets hit! (one swig per half-heart).\n\nHAVE FUN! :)","May 17, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Tight corridors, blind corners, a limited eight-round chamber with retrievable bullets and fast, aggressive enemies and turrets. You usually learn lessons the hard way, but the smart design ensures you come across each problem one at a time; at the same time this design encourages careful, precise play over guns-blazing tactics. 10 hours in, I still don't know exactly what's going to be around each corner, but I do know that usually the best option is to keep my eyes and ears open, aim true, reload often, and shoot sparingly. The feeling of learning the game is highly rewarding.\n\nHeavy Bullets punishes mistakes hard, but it does well to alleviate frustrations with some neat twists.

The graphics are simple but clear and easy to look at, and it looks smooth enough at 60fps, the aforementioned stutters notwithstanding.

Simple in concept, the scaling difficulty, introduction of new monsters/items, unique playstyle, and randomly generated maps are sure to hold your interest as you dash through the halls of High Rise, an odd, shady company with unknown ulterior motives. Someone has infiltrated the mainframe and it is up to YOU, an unnamed maintenance person, to fix it and restore order. You are given a revolver with six (heavy) bullets and dropped into the deadly labyrinth with no way back. Whoever infiltrated the mainframe is probably the person defacing the walls with black scribbles, notes to no one...or maybe to you? Find the 'x' they marked and receive a possibly lifesaving item. Even as you are on a mission to save their asses, High Rise makes you pay for everything from more ammo to items and even health. Beginning the game you were on the side of High Rise, but as you near the end......\n....you'll realize there's no story and it's just a dungeon crawler.\nFun though.","February 28","true","20.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's gimmick, the way you have to pick up and conserve bullets plays out really well and the game does a great job of making that fun.\n\nBut there are all these roguelike mechanics that just make me not enjoy my runs.  You can bank gold and an item for a future run.  You can only carry one item at a time, or two with a backpack.  The shops are randomised, so you aren't always able to buy what you want.  There are some certainties: the Medical shop will always have heals and the ammo shop will always have bullets, but you are in no way guaranteed a shot at the rarer upgrades such as the backpack or increased MaxHP.  That last one's a killer, especially when there's no way to practice against bosses.\n\nFurthermore, while the level design is complex and fun to run around in, it doesn't always make much sense.  You find shops before you find enemies and hence have no money to spend.  There are doors that go to empty rooms.  Some levels will have three secrets in them, and in some runs I can go three or more levels without finding a secret.  Now, since you can only carry one or two items, missing out on a few extra choices isn't so bad, except for the fact that you can sell items for money.  I just feel that having a few failsafes built into the level generation would be a huge boon.  Other games in the genre ensure a secret in each level, or a locked shop, or an item, or something, but with Heavy Bullets the only consistancy are the banking machines.\n\nPerhaps that's part of the game's design, part of it's theme:  You have to grind up to win.  You have to throw away lives failing in order to pay to win.\n\nIt's a decent enough game, but it's just so discouraging to play.","August 29, 2015","false","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The enemies are ruthless and will destroy you if you don't tread carefully. Sometimes they even blend in with the pastel-colored scenery (GOD DAMN SNAKES).

I must say, I got more than my money's worth and the full price should be right on the money with this one.\n\nNot much to say about the game that wasn't already on the store page. It's intense, colourful, playful and fun. You'll need decent reaction times and a good aim to deal with the enemies, as well as a keen eye to spot the kinds that like to hide in the environment. Levels are randomly combines, though you'll probably recognize some of the rooms from your previous playthroughs (this happened to me once in 70 minutes of gameplay). Ammo collection mechanic makes every encounter meaningful, the items you can get offer different approaches to a variety of situations and the banking system allows you to have your more casual playthroughs contribute as increased resources for the playthrough you try to beat the game on.\n\nOne complaint is the cheap death I got in the first boss fight: I had no idea what I might be facing, and there was very little time to react once the door opened. This is pretty standard in the genre though, and my first encounter did give me enough info to know what to do the next time, so that's not so big of a deal.\n\nIf the game looks fun, buy and enjoy!","November 11, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are some things that would make this, already fantastic game, all the better: adding more algorthmic possibilities for the room structures and layouts would add some more fear to the game, in the two hours of gameplay I have experienced, I have already started to notice some patterns. It would also be great to be able to have a sort of co-op or competitive co-op implimented into this game. It would also be great if this game were to be released on home consoles *cough* PS4 *cough* but whatever you do with this game, just know it is f***ing amazing.

Almost every death is cheap with snakeworms poisoning you with barely any health left on level 7. If it isn't snakeworms, it's the ridiculously powerful turrets (especially the ones that fire ROCKETS at you).\nThe bosses are the worst part - they're always far too quick for you to even understand what's happening as both of the 2 bosses last usually less than 15 seconds. Unless you have the focus pills (single-use slow motion powerup), you'll systematically either die or come out of the fight with half a heart left.\nBesides all that, it's nevertheless a good FPS.\n\nDid I mention performance? It's all over the place - I've read reviews in which performance was perfect, and others that complained about low FPS, which I have to confirm. The game runs poorly on a GTX970 and i5-4690k @ 3.50Ghz, a PC able to play almost any game on ultra with a steady framerate. This includes stuff like MGSV, Far Cry 4, Crysis 3, and other generally demanding games.\nThe game doesn't look bad, but judging by the low amount of polygons and textures, there's really no excuse for it to dip down to 30-40FPS at random intervals.\n\nIf you find it on sale, buy it. Despite my review being mostly negative, there are a lot of positive aspects to the game - but also negatives.","August 18, 2015","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The enemies are ruthless and will destroy you if you don't tread carefully. Sometimes they even blend in with the pastel-colored scenery (GOD DAMN SNAKES).

I've really been into pixel retro platform games lately but never got over my love of a great FPS. Well this is both, and it's fantastic. It's fantastic because every bullet counts and you don't know what lies around the corner.

The entire game is a nice difficulty progression starting out hard, then slowly getting harder over the course of it's 8 levels, but then level 8 happens. Introducing infinitely spawning enemies and spamming walking/flying turrets in a single room made me want to flat out quit playing this game, it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I understand the game is supposed to be hard but spamming enemies that poison you from accross an entire room (which take more than one shot to kill, not to mention their poison attack is instant) is almost making me regret buying this. It shouldn't be 7 levels of manageable dificulty then a HUGE SPIKE for the last level, it's absurd.\n\nIf you're ok with having all your progress dumped into the toilet because of the unreasonable spike of difficulty at the end, this is for you. I can't really give it a great recommendation but the rest of the game is very solid as a rogue-like FPS.","May 23, 2014","false","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've gotten to the final boss 3 times and on my very first time, I could have easily beaten him, but didn't know how and ran around the room until I finally died. It's definitely worth it though. I may come back to this game once I get tired of my Vive games...so in like 2 years.\n\n9/10 would recommended pulling the lever on the final boss fight.","May 3","true","18.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The entire game is a nice difficulty progression starting out hard, then slowly getting harder over the course of it's 8 levels, but then level 8 happens. Introducing infinitely spawning enemies and spamming walking/flying turrets in a single room made me want to flat out quit playing this game, it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

I think Heavy Bullets is a prime example that you can make a great game without too much fluff. It's got great gameplay, amazing visuals, a surreal atmosphere and it's a great price.","April 24","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loved the entire aesthetic, the enemies, the randomness, and the hair-pulling frustration.\n\nI loved this game to pieces when it still worked, which is why it's so hard for me to give it a thumbs down.\n\nThe game is broken in a way that is just subtle enough to make it next to impossible to beat. It stutters every once in a while and the view lags behind where the player actually is, causing unnecessary YASD and frustration. All because the dev refuses to fix this broken game.\n\nHundreds of people have complained about this glitch. The dev knows about it, but have left the game to rot for over a year. Games that have such a serious glitch shouldn't go on sale. I'm at my wits end. Maybe a stream of negative reviews will get them to fix it, but they already have my money.","November 14, 2014","false","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
