Judgment Rites makes its glorious return.\n\nI played this game long ago and still have the original CD stored next to my computer.\nAt that time, i was stuck on a level and had no chance to look up a solution - the level with the red baron airplane that shoots you "down" at the start of the mission. I was frustrated and then stopped playing it after multiple attempts. The time passed by and before i realized it, the game did not work anympore on the newer computers. I then lost sight on the game, but it survived multiple relocations and i kept in touch with multiple Star Trek games.\n\nWell, by sheer luck i saw the 25 year anniversary stuff here on steam and clicked it - then i saw it. Star Trek - Judgment Rites. I was like "Whaaat the f***? Is someone trolling me?" ... 6€? Slept over it a night ( i don't know anymore why i did hesitate at first) and then HELL YEAH i bought it.\n\nIt looks amazing. No, really. At a time where we start going into the VR phase of our RL - Oculus Rift and stuff - these "simple" graphics do give us what we need. The environment feels just "right". Sound is also fine and you get a ton of the good "old" trekkie stuff like the comments from Spock and Mc Coy aka. Bones.\n\nThis is indeed a "must have" for every Trekkie - and interesting for everyone else who can afford the 6€.\n\n\nRatings (MIGHT be influenced by my affection for Star Trek and especially for this game ;)):\n\nGraphics 9/10  (some scenes could have been done better, the quality of the cutscenes and videos differes)\nSound effects 8/10  (mostly amazing, but sometimes not as good as it could be, even at that time)\nStory 9/10  (almost perfect, but you really have to look out for everything. You might sometimes find yourself stuck because you miss something cause you did not try out all spots with all items - that can lead to frustration)\n\nWARNING: This game has NO tutorial! And since you don't have the small book that came with it originally you MUST look up the key bindings on the internet since you CANT look them up ingame! *edit* You can find the original book here --> http://www.mocagh.org/miscgame/judgmentrites-manual.pdf\n\nSERIOUS WARNING: You should SAVE from time to time. This game does NOT auto-save. If you FAIL you will have to REDO the whole mission you are currently doing (or maybe the whole game, but i am not sure at this moment). So SAVE AT LAST EVERY 10 MINUTES!\n\nBtw: YES is does work on Windows 10, it opens a DosBox. You can Fullscreen by holding ALT and then press ENTER.","September 9, 2015","true","1.8"," 29 of 29 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","29","29","2","0"
