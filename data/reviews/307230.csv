Unfortunately the game mechanics are very imprecise - you have to guess how far enemies can see, how much damage they cause, the zombie AI tends to get stuck, obstacles are seen from an isometric perspective and thus often don't provide cover even though they block your view etc. The result is that challenge equals trial and error in this game. The price is the only thing that is fair about this game.\n\nStill, I've definitely played worse games.

But how this game looks like? It is 2D game, you are zombie, you are outnumbered by civilians and soldiers. Your goal is to convince everyone to become zombie, usually by biting. Civilians are cowards, so they just run, but soldiers are brave and they have guns. You have to be smart and always try to outnumber your enemies. You can give simple orders to your small zombie army and develop new tactics.\nGame is simple, but enjoyable, graphic and music are ok - it is indie production after all. Flaws?

A game for casual gamers, where you can control your very own army of Zombies and cause havoc? I am game!\n\nSo, you have your very own little zombie and you are given your first tutorial mission. This mission is just to be sure that you know how to use the directional keys and understand the basic concept that if you are a zombie and try to close to an unarmed human, they will run from you. And if for some reason you manage to stand just long enough next to them, well.... yey, you just made a new zombie friend.\n\nAfter the tutorial and the first couple of levels, you realise what I,Zombie will be all about -  a combination of a stealth / puzzler game, with a brief touch of RTS. All in all, it is a relatively short game, with only 20 levels. However, level design is solid. It has a nice learning curve and level difficulty increases gradually.\n\nThe soundtrack, in its never ending loop combines well with I,Zombie , and the visuals are quite nice for this little game. I particularly like the main zombie design, as it sort of reminds me a Tim Burton meets Simpsons combination. Oh well, Danny Elfman had already set that link before, so perhaps that concept isn't so far fetched.\n\n\nIn short, these are the things I can point out as positive in I,Zombie - The concept, level design, the soundtrack and the main little zombie. Seems like we are heading for a masterpiece!\n\nNow the painful bit....\n\nThe first thing I have noticed after initial seconds of gameplay was that there controls weren't very responsive. There seems to be a lag between hitting a button and the character acting on it, and it becomes incredibly frustrating playing throughout levels of stealth without really knowing where your character's movement will end. I came to realise that as you lower the resolution, I,Zombie will run faster and the commands will become more responsive... but at this point I have started questioning myself if I it was fair to expect having fluidity issues with a Unity based game. However, lowering the resolution will reduce the game window, and if you fall lower than 800 x 600, I would recommend that you play it through with the aid of a magnifying glass.\n\nApart from unresponsive controls, I have often struggled with basic movement. More often than not, my little Zombie would get stuck on the edge of a box or some other obstacle, without being very clear why.\n\nThe combination of broken controls with some movement issues turned almost every level into a trial an error experience. And whereas in the first couple of levels I was still going for the 3 stars rating, the frustration soon took over me and my main goal became powering through the 20 levels I,Zombie had to offer.\n\nEventually I had another go in reaching max stars and beating I,Zombie in less than 15 minutes, in order to complete the achievements. Unfortunately this ended up as another disappointment, as for some reason they still appear as "incomplete"\n\nApart from the nice basic visuals, I,Zombie also had a couple of graphic glitches as the constant flickering of white lines all over the place or the glitchy rain effects (which seem completely unnecessary and don't bring any added value to the game).\n\nTo sum up, it is a nice game, with a nice concept and ideas and solid map building. However, the several flaws it has turn what should be an enjoyable game into a frustrating experience. At some point you have to wonder if the fact it is so short is actually a thing for it or against it.\n\nHowever, I do think that the price is fair an is often on steam sales. If you are curious, by all means get it, but don't expect a masterpiece.\n\nNote to the developers: I am quite sure you have put quite an effort into it, please don't see my review as just someone taking a shot at you. I can see that there are plenty of people recommending I,Zombie... I am just not one of them :)","February 25","false","4.5"," 26 of 36 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","26","36","0","2"

So those that got helmets on are going to shoot you and those with ordinary hats you are going to bite to get zombies to command (stop, follow , attack)...\nPersonally I think it is a bit strange that the game were not originally tagged as a strategy game also as I think that though "arcade" like then strategy is needed IMO (I see that later it now has been tagged as strategy also).\nOtherwise, I haven't played the game that long but it seem worth a try and the small price to pay..\nGame is with indie / retro style graphics and while it may look relatively simple then it is probably not that easy.......","December 9, 2014","true","0.2"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","25","35","0","2"

Never heard of them.) and adding fun nuances along the way, the game doesn't disappoint. Simple controls make the game quick to learn but later levels prove that the game is far from easy.\n\nOverall, a great twist on the zombie genre and a great game. It combines the feeling of frustration every time you lose to that one, damn, evil, HORRIBLE F***ING SOLDIER, and the joy when one of your minions bites off that EVIL SOLDIER'S head.\nSo, the game is a must-have for any zombie fan.

You are a zombie who goes around the section attempting to turn everyone into a zombie without dying.

Rather than an all out assault much of I, Zombie is about positioning and sneak attacks as enemies have a limited field of vision but can still kill you quickly if they spot you far away. I loved getting the drop on patrolling guards and seeing my numbers grow, maneuvering my horde with a limited but effective number of commands as I infected every moving thing in the level. I, Zombie's biggest problem, again, is that it takes this mechanic and tries to do too much too quickly.\n\nWith only 20 very short levels (usually under two minutes if you do things right) there's very little time for the game to capitalize on its mechanics, peppering in different ideas throughout without giving them enough attention. It keeps the hour long experience varied, but I never felt as if the level designs were making much use of the enjoying ideas the game presents, merely showing some basic examples of how they work so you know how to use them before the difficulty catapults upward. Many of the later levels require infuriating amounts of precision to complete, often requiring you to follow an absolute line to get through them, and any deviation resulting in your very quick death. The final level in particular is such a poorly designed embodiment of trial and error that I ended up having to resort to watching a level walkthrough, and even then still had a great amount of trouble actually pulling it off.\n\nI, Zombie is entertaining for what it is, but more often than not its attempts to make more interesting use of its mechanics is simply by raising the challenge in cheap and frustrating ways. I'd love to see the core of the experience spun out into a larger and more ambitious game, but for now it acts more as a proof of concept than something I can recommend.","December 9, 2014","false","1.1"," 27 of 51 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","27","51","0","0"

Early levels are pretty straightforward, the later levels tend to require a bit more planning of where to go and when, plus along the way there are a few tips and tricks you can pick up of how to manage your fellow zombies.\n\nYour resources for each level are yourself - faster than the rest, and you control yourself directly with the cursor keys (or probably gamepad, haven't tried and the keys worked fine for me), and the zombies you have turned in the level so far which can be set to follow you, stay where they are, or attack the nearest non-zombie. Once you learn how to manage your brethren they can be used as a shield to cover your approach to a patrolling soldier, a distraction to let you get in closer before being shot at, or set up to attack the other of a pair of patrolling soldiers that are too far apart to just rush from one side. Your comrades can be a bit annoying and snag on the scenery occasionally, and they are really annoying to try and get past the sentry guns intact when a level requires that, but apart from those things the game plays pretty smoothly.\n\nOnce you have completed a level and survived you can move onto the next level, or replay it and try to find a way to complete the level without any zombies dying in the process, thus earning three stars. There are twenty levels (plus a training mission) to work through, and particularly the last half of them tend to be interesting and may take a while to figure out a good plan of attack, or get the timing right. Once that is done there is also potentially a bit of replayability trying to find a faster route to win each level, but beyond that it is not really the sort of game you will go back to again, as once you know how to do each level there isn't much more to gain from it. But it is quite fun to go through that one first time.","March 27, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Watch the trailer first, if you like trailer then buy this game when on sale. As I said game is quite short, it took me one hour to finish it with all achievements done. Difficulty is well-balanced.

At least ten or more levels would've been nice. The game is so short that i've managed to get only one steam trading card dropped out of available 3.\n\nA little buggy. In some levels where you have to get through small spaces, zombie tends to stuck out of nowhere.\n\nAlso that, "you cannot eat the guards" levels are just annoying.

Graphics, music and sound are okay and everything fits together. There are multiple options for the controls. You can play with Mouse, Keyboard and Controller or combine them. All 3 options work pretty fine.\n\nOne annoying flaw is, that you can easily get stuck on obstacles which slows down your movement. So if you're not precise enough and you try to take a sharp corner, you will get slowed and gunned down.

Casual Fun.  Be the Zombie.  Control the horde. Make more zombies.  Fun times.\n\n- Casual fun in a nutshell.  Short levels.\n- I recommend using a controller.  Keyboard controls are a bit clunky.  I found with a controller, movement and control is fairly smooth.\n- For the $2 price tag (49 cents on sale) the arcade-style graphics and sound are excellent.\n- For the basic game, replayability is very limited, unless you are going for 3 stars on each level and some achievements or leaderboard stats. However, as there is a level editor, and a community creating new levels, this greatly increases the playtime you will get out of this game.\n- Trading Cards!  Achievements! Leaderboards! Yay!\n- The dev for this game is fantastic.  Very accessible, responsive, positive, professional and will work to resolve any issue you might have.   (Yes, I had an issue that was quickly resolved by the dev).\n\nIn conclusion, it is what it is.  A great way to toss a little time.

You are looking at 1-3 hours depending on how skilled and *lucky* you are. The main source of annoyance from this game is the zombie AI.

I am just glad this game isn't pixelated because I am getting sick of pixelated games. The levels are either stupidly easy or unbearably unfair and difficult.

There is generally only one way to complete a level and therefore not much replay value. This includes irritating stealth levels where the enemies can't be killed, no matter how effective your attacks are. If you think that the simple mechanics and repeating textures mean that the developers created lots of content for the game, you're wrong. There are only twenty levels and they all take around a minute to complete.

This looks to be an almost decent excuse for the game, made for either tablets or consoles, that was directly ported to PC, with no time whatsoever to change anything.  Literally, there is zero mouse function for this game.  I have not in my entire life since I played games on a Tandy not been able to use the mouse in gaming.  You will navigate the main menu & game with only the keyboard.  But as for the game itself...\n\nThe cheeky little intro video has IMO, the best thing about this game, the music.  I am not sure if it was done by the person whom made the game itself, but whoever did, if I was ever interested in working on a game with them, this would be the only area I would like to recruit them for.  The music is absolutely great, it is catchy, although repetitive, you don't get tired of playing it, though the short levels you'll be going through.  Oh, yes btw, every single level in the game is extremely short.\n\nBecause, after about 3-4 of the stupidly simple first few, you'll start to run into the problems of gameplay here.  Your zombie will quite easily get stuck on walls.  As in, NES times levels, stuck on walls.  This game is merciless in allowing you to make mistakes.  Generally getting stuck on a wall, or making a single mistake at the wrong time will cost you your one and only life, and then you restart the entire level.  Now, some of these levels do have some interesting ways you must finish them, so there is a slight bit of entertainment in the figuring out of how to sneak past the guards, and get to the unarmed civilians, which if you can manage to do, you can walk your zombie over to them, their health bars drop, and they become generic zombies under your control.  Now you may very roughly control them with essentially 3 commands: Stay in one place, follow me, go towards the nearest enemy head on and attack it.  These controls are barely good enough to bypass the levels if you are extremely patient, skilled & have a good sense of timing.\n\nSpeaking of patience, however, this game has even run mine out.  I have the patience of a Hindu ♥♥♥♥ing goat high on mushrooms and weed + Jesus Christ, but this ♥♥♥♥ing game...let's talk about the final level I am on.  I have looked up a video of how to beat it.  I have seen the man in the video able to do it, but he even had to stop his video, play the game for God knows how long, and come back to it once he had figured it out.  In the game the only enemies, are regular green soldiers, and special forces soldiers.  Now, green soldiers will shoot a single bullet at you, that if it hits, will both damage you, and slow you down.  (Who knew zombies had nervous systems, and were affected by things like getting shot.)  These soldiers after a few missions, aren't too difficult to deal with, as if you get to them, like normal civilians, if you damage them enough you can kill & convert them.  The special forces on the other hand, are a totally different thing.  They not only are armed with machine guns, which will spell almost guaranteed death if they hit you with even one bullet, but they are COMPLETELY ♥♥♥♥ING IMMUNE TO DAMAGE.  That's right!  You could walk up to them, and stand there all day long, with some sort of invincibility cheat/God mode turned on, and they will never die.  They are immortal enemies.  Frankly, this is a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game mechanic.  It would have been like, having to fight Starman in Super Maro Bros.\n\nIn closing, I do not recommend this game, would not recommend this game, ever.  If anything, a soundtrack to this game should be sold, and the game itself taken off the market.  I bought it for 54 cents, and would not pay one for it now, or even DL it if it were free having played it.\n\nI'd give this game 4/10, giving 3 points for the great music, and 1 point for the little bit of fun had while playing it.","July 23, 2015","false","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The colourful rounded artstyle gives way to an oddly cheerful zombie apocalypse. Art asside the gameplay is simple and easy to grasp, sadly though, there isn't much. Commanding your zombies and shambling about as a zombie yourself in this game leaves you feeling as if there could be more. Granted this game focusses more on timing and choosing targets strategically in order to finish the levels with minimal casualties for that 3 star score.\n\nOn the downside, this game feels like one of many Mobile to PC ports which brings with it a few bugs. One I found particularly troublesome was having to start as administrator because the game would totally lock up on the main menu shortly after launching. Another bug that was a little annoying was when controls were unresponsive for a short period of time, this usually fixed itself within the span of 2-3 seconds but was annoying none-the-less.\n\nAll in all for it's $2 asking price I'd certainly recomend it for casual gamers and achievement hunters alike.","November 16, 2015","true","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Music makes or breaks games for me, so to find a mixed and highly more-ish soundtrack in something that cost 39p is great. Although I'm left with the impression that 'music4' (the piano track) had a couple of bum notes hit during recording.\n\nRecommended.","November 6, 2015","true","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It becomes fairly difficult pretty early on and you really have to strategize in a lot of cases. Additionally, I have so far always felt that my death had been caused by me and not some flaw in the game (despite the controls, more on that...); when you die it makes you go "Shoot, I could have done that better".\n\nThe only "flaw" (not a big deal really), if I could consider it such would be the aforementioned controls. In this game, moving around is done with the arrow keys and your 3 actions are done with 'a', 's', and 'd', this being the only configuration; no changeable bindings. The only issue I have with this is that my more nimble fingers are stuck with the job of triggering actions rather than moving. I have not found any cfg or txt files containing the bindings. The game was created using XNA Game Studio Express so I suspect that the controls are probably hidden deep within some of the .XNB binaries scattered about the game directory. Regardless, I got over it.\n\nThis game is good for when you are waiting for a download or on the go with your Shield or just wanna see how fast you can solve a puzzle that wants you dead. Plus, I got it for free anyway so I am satisfied. Although I advise you get it while this 10% off sale is still up.\n\n4/5","December 14, 2014","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I felt like the line of sight in this game was a little bit off and I constantly found that I underestimate the guards range. I do think that there would be a lot of room for improvment if the guards aggro wasnt the same for infront of them as it is behind them. over all a good game. with a little more content and maybe a dlc this game could be great. well worth the $1.70 I spent on it.\nalso please make a level editor, let the steam community make this the great game it can be!\n\n","December 14, 2014","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, it runs very smoothly and I've experienced no noticeable bugs.\n\nThe controls are not ideal, as you control your zombie character with the directional arrows, and command your zombie horde with A, S, D. At times, you can get the keys mixed up, sending all of your zombies to their death, while you frantically and futily try to recall your zombies as they get mowed down from behind. Utimately, this probably only adds to the challenge and ends up being a feature, not a detriment.\n\nI, Zombie is a quirky, original, and refreshing take on the zombie "genre" and puzzle games. This game is definately worth $2 and if its on sale, its worth having in your collection.\n\nSide notes: If you are looking for a game whose acheivements are challenging, and can be completed in a day and a half, pick this up.\n\n","April 2, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The premise is simple:  You're a zombie trying to turn everyone else into a zombie before soldiers shoot you to pieces.

I cannot dissagree with this statement. This zombie game is very unique, as you are a zombie (lets call him BOB), and your goal is to infect all the zombies on the level as possible, only infecting them all will result in completion. However, you need to be very stratigic in this game, as loosing a single zombie may be the difference between getting 1 star, 2 star, or even 3 stars! Time to complete the level may also result in how many stars you get, some level (3?) have stars set to how much time you take to complete it, this may also be a very stratigicly difficult part of the game: one of the achievements of this game is to complete the entire game in less that 15 minutes. So replaying levels over and over to get the lowest time possible will likely happen. Despite many achievements being hard to difficult to get, this game is still easy enough to add to your 100% group. In addition, some cons come with the game, mainly being the length of the game, with 21 levels (including a mini-tutorial), it is short. Nevertheless, the game is only $1.99, and it is frequently on sale, and if it not on sale many coupons for the game from 50% to even 90% are flying around steam.\n\n79/100 Bananas","March 24, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I only spent 40p on it as I got a coupon for crafting my L4D2 badge and thought why not? I'm really glad I bought the game as I thoroughly enjoyed it...although I did find myself having a merry swear at some bits when I couldn't do them. The game starts off really simple but gets much harder very quickly. Some levels appear fairly simple in theory but in practice they're quite a bit more difficult as they rely on very tight timing.\n\nHere are a few things I really liked about this:\n\n- The zombies are very cute and you really do feel bad when you accidentally let them die.\n- There were a few levels with different objectives thrown into the mix and it provided a nice change.\n- I LOVE the music.

So the game is actually pretty fun- you play as the zombie and your mission is to eat every human and turn them into walkers, like yourself. The levels are designed to make you think and plan strategically- something that I didn't think the game would offer. I, Zombie NORMALLY doesn't have you blazing in, chomping off everyone's face, no, I, Zombie forces you to plan out moves and command your squad of walkers (if you have any) to get the job done. So yes, if you do end up infecting any other humans, they will turn into zombies and you can command them to do things such as stop, attack, or follow you.\n\nGraphics\nSo even though this game isn't THAT old, it still looks pretty bad, if i do say so myself. Even at the highest resolution I can go (1440 x 900) the game will still look pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the game will be out of proportion with my monitor (meaning that there are those nasty black lines on the outer edges of the screen). If you're going to buy this for graphics, PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, SAVE YOUR MONEY.\n\nGameplay\nLots of gameplay aspects were mentioned in the review up top, so I'll recap.\n- Commanding your walker squad\n- Planning out your moves\n- Infecting guards/pedestrians to then infect others\nOverall, gameplay mechanics are very smooth and effective. Nothing really seems overpowered.\n\nSoundtrack\nVery generic, nothing like death metal. It makes the game feel light, nimble, and fast. It made the game seem less violent then it actually should seem like. The soundtrack makes me feel like the game is rated E10.\n\nConclusion\nBuy it- it's lots of fun and not really violent. Get it while it's on sale because it's seemingly on sale a lot and even then, the game only costs $1.99 on a regular day. 9/10","May 18, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ie, kill all humans to turn into zombies. Games that dideveloperi by Awesome Games Studio is quite simple. Simply kill all the people in the first chapter, you will win. However, in each chapter, also different levels of difficulty. Well, the wait moment until the end, following a review of mine:\nPositive\n- Side buttons comfortable enough to control the player in the game by controlling forces. And we also can use the Gamepad Controller to play this game\n- Music is also nice, fits with the theme of this game.\n-Graphic For indie games, very nice. Simple, yet cool !!\nNegative\n- No sound of human screams if we pursue them, too far for realistic? Not really, because this indie game\n- Human character in this game has flaws, that is? If they run, and has reached the end of the wall. Human character can not run nowhere else, just ran to the side and also it is very slow to run away from us, so the difficulty is reduced in this game.\nSo if the game is recommended for you? For games below Rp. 20,000 may be recommended, and also to you who are fans of Indie Games.\nRating: 7/10 AFM","February 27, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its a very pleasent and relaxing puzzle game more for casual players! Its a great concept I only wish there was to the game as its very short.

I felt like the line of sight in this game was a little bit off and I constantly found that I underestimate the guards range. I do think that there would be a lot of room for improvment if the guards aggro wasnt the same for infront of them as it is behind them. over all a good game. with a little more content and maybe a dlc this game could be great. well worth the $1.70 I spent on it.\nalso please make a level editor, let the steam community make this the great game it can be!\n\n","December 14, 2014","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I find myself constantly getting hung up on the edges of corners or if I stick too close to walls.\n\nAnd all your "minion" zombies that follow you have the same problem... in addition to having pretty clunky pathing AI.\n\n\nHad these two factors been executed more cleanly and effectively, I could totally see how the overwhelming difficulty and lethality of the enemy soliders would be justified. However, considering the trouble I have just moving around the game board, it amounts to overkill in my opinion.\n\n\nI still give the developers credit for coming up with such an instantly addicting game, a great and concise premise, art and music... but having to restart every level after 15 a dozen times, I just can't bring myself to care to finish.\n\nThat said, even at the full price of $2 dollars it's worth a look.

I cannot dissagree with this statement. This zombie game is very unique, as you are a zombie (lets call him BOB), and your goal is to infect all the zombies on the level as possible, only infecting them all will result in completion. However, you need to be very stratigic in this game, as loosing a single zombie may be the difference between getting 1 star, 2 star, or even 3 stars! Time to complete the level may also result in how many stars you get, some level (3?) have stars set to how much time you take to complete it, this may also be a very stratigicly difficult part of the game: one of the achievements of this game is to complete the entire game in less that 15 minutes. So replaying levels over and over to get the lowest time possible will likely happen. Despite many achievements being hard to difficult to get, this game is still easy enough to add to your 100% group. In addition, some cons come with the game, mainly being the length of the game, with 21 levels (including a mini-tutorial), it is short. Nevertheless, the game is only $1.99, and it is frequently on sale, and if it not on sale many coupons for the game from 50% to even 90% are flying around steam.\n\n79/100 Bananas","March 24, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's it.\n5) Lack of variety in gameplay. You just dodge/walk to a target, infect, then move on to the next.\n6) Getting stuck on edges and corners even though you clearly are not touching them.\n7) Lack of sounds effects.\n8) Zombie AI needs a bit more work. They often either get stuck or split and go to undesirable directions.\n\nOverall it feels like an incomplete game and the devs could have done better. It gets boring when there's only one way to kill targets leaving no room for creativity.  It could have been nice if there were powerups that give you more options to approach and dodge targets like invisibility, decoys, burrowing, turning into a crate, etc. Also adding some more sound effects such as screams when enemies are running away or being eaten by you would break the dullness.\n\nI look forward however to an improved sequel.","February 15, 2015","false","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I used to play between breaks at school, do 1 level here, 1 level there. I have to say that this is an extremely rewarding game to play. It causes you to think about all of your actions and strategize about the best and fastest ways to beat the levels. A few goods and a few not so goods to round out this review:\n\nGood:\n- Rewarding Gameplay: Easily the most notable feature. The levels are set up in such a way that it rewards you for your patience and strategy. (or for speed runs: SPEED)\n- Leaderboards: Though just about everyone has gotten perfect stars on every level in this game, it then challenges you to see how fast of a speed run you can do to beat the levels.\n- Challenging enough: The levels are challenging enough that you may get stuck on some for a bit, but they are never impossible, as long as you try to formulate some sort of strategy.\n\nNot So Good:\nShort: It's such a short game. I think I have 3 hours logged onto the game and I've completed it with all the achievements. That's not to say that this should deter you at all. It's a short game, but a really great game.\nSemi-linear completion: Some of the levels are constructed in such a way that you have to comply to the level's mechanics to beat the level, meaning that on some levels, you may be able to have a few different choices of where to go to add to your zombie family first, while some, you will have to follow a set standard of how you beat the level. It's not terrible, but I think it would feel even better to have some more choices. Having said that, it doesn't take away from the gameplay.\n\nThat's really it! It's innovative and fun with really negligible shortcomings. I would definitely recommend this game. I got it on sale, but after playing it, I totally would have bought it at full price too.","June 27, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So the game is actually pretty fun- you play as the zombie and your mission is to eat every human and turn them into walkers, like yourself. The levels are designed to make you think and plan strategically- something that I didn't think the game would offer. I, Zombie NORMALLY doesn't have you blazing in, chomping off everyone's face, no, I, Zombie forces you to plan out moves and command your squad of walkers (if you have any) to get the job done. So yes, if you do end up infecting any other humans, they will turn into zombies and you can command them to do things such as stop, attack, or follow you.\n\nGraphics\nSo even though this game isn't THAT old, it still looks pretty bad, if i do say so myself. Even at the highest resolution I can go (1440 x 900) the game will still look pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the game will be out of proportion with my monitor (meaning that there are those nasty black lines on the outer edges of the screen). If you're going to buy this for graphics, PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, SAVE YOUR MONEY.\n\nGameplay\nLots of gameplay aspects were mentioned in the review up top, so I'll recap.\n- Commanding your walker squad\n- Planning out your moves\n- Infecting guards/pedestrians to then infect others\nOverall, gameplay mechanics are very smooth and effective. Nothing really seems overpowered.\n\nSoundtrack\nVery generic, nothing like death metal. It makes the game feel light, nimble, and fast. It made the game seem less violent then it actually should seem like. The soundtrack makes me feel like the game is rated E10.\n\nConclusion\nBuy it- it's lots of fun and not really violent. Get it while it's on sale because it's seemingly on sale a lot and even then, the game only costs $1.99 on a regular day. 9/10","May 18, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Over time, however, and perhaps it could just be my game, but I noticed a series of bugs plaguing my levels constantly. Characters would stop moving like they were supposed to and stand still, forcing me to restart the level. Or the enemies could shoot me through walls, when I was clearly supposed to be hidden. I don't remember how much I bought this for, but I think it was very cheap, under a dollar, probably. So for a good few days I was entertained, but then I just got frustrated with how poorly made it was. I suppose it was worth it in the end.

The gameplay is quite simple; you move your zombie on a small area trying to infect as many people as you can; and the more people you infect, the more help you have. You can then order your zombie followers around with simple commands, like making them follow you or attack your enemies.\n\nThe levels are very good; there's 20 of them, and some are quite challenging, but they're still somewhat easy, so it shouldn't take you too long to finish it. Even then, it's a fun little game to spend some time in.\n\nEDIT (March 9th, 2016):\n\nThe game has recently gotten a new update, the "Winter update", which adds 10 new levels with a winter theme and three new achievements. They're quite challenging, especially if you want to get the three stars in them; however, just like the main game, they aren't very time consuming.\n\nEDIT #2 (April 14th, 2016):\n\nIt has gotten another update today, which adds a level editor and Workshop support.

I liked most of the levels except level 20 that was purely perfectly timing avoiding the invicible soldiers.  Consider it for 90 minutes of mild fun, with 19 levels until you get stuck, and then community levels after that.","May 1","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can then order your zombie followers around with simple commands, like making them follow you or attack your enemies.\n\nThe levels are very good; there's 20 of them, and some are quite challenging, but they're still somewhat easy, so it shouldn't take you too long to finish it.

The fact that soldier's shooting and your bitting are animated with same time frame is annoying as hell as no matter that you stepped on the soldier in between his shots, you're still bitting the same speed and moment when he's shooting, which leads to so much moments of you dying the same moment soldier got changed it's beyond depresive.","May 29","false","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My 'I, Zombie' guy would auto-run into the upper left corner of the screen & nothing I tried fixed it (changing keyboards/mice/controllers), until I noticed that I had the eXact Same issue with another UNITY ENGINE game, and the light in my head clicked on!  After TONS of researching, it turns out that the unwanted input/movement was being caused by Vjoy - A virtual joystick software necessary for head tracking IR sets, like used in driving sims & some FPS games like CSGO.  After removal of the Vjoy - all the UNITY Engine games ran normally  - I put in these details in the event that somebody else is having the same issue - Hope this helps - Cheers","May 29","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
