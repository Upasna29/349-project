And he said, Behold the cart, full: but where is the cash for offering?\n\n8 And the gamers said, My cash, Edmund McMillen will provide himself cash for an offering: so they went both of them together, because mediums of exchange are incapable of  critical thinking.\n\n9 And they came to the place which Edmund had told them of; and the gamers chilled there, and placed the order, and bound their cash and laid him on the altar of purchase.\n\n10 And the gamers stretched forth their hands, and inched their cursors towards confirmation.\n\n11 And Tyrone Rodriguez called unto gamers out of Nicalis, and said, gamers, gamers: and he said, Here am I.\n\n12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the cash, neither do thou any thing unto it: for now I know that thou fearest cancellation; seeing thou hast not withheld thy cash, thine only cash for this pay period.\n\n13 And  the gamers lifted up their eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a northern lion: and the gamers went and took the northern lion, and criticized him for taking Mom's Knife, in stead of their cash.\n\n14 And the gamers called that game Rebirth: as it is said to this day, In the mount of  Indie it shall be seen.\n\nThe Binding of Isaac, released back in 2011, is a rogue-like indie darling that wears its Zelda influences on its sleeves. You play as Isaac, a young boy living with his mother. His mother, convinced she is being spoken to by God, must offer Isaac up to prove her love and devotion to Him. Isaac, in an understandable act of defiant self-interest, descends into the basement to escape. It's there that the game begins. You fight all manner of monstrosities down below, ranging from hideous pin worms, cleft-lipped disembodied heads, physical manifestations of the Seven Deadly Sins, and the Horsemen of the Apocalypse.\n\nYou start fighting the denizens of your basement with your tears – yes, this game is a strange one – but as you progress you'll find unlockables (in stores, treasure rooms, arcades, etc.) that change your tear effects, sometimes drastically (and sometimes your appearance). To win you have to juggle health, bombs, keys, and money. You'll have to find secret rooms (and secreter rooms!).  And of course, you'll have to fight... well, I won't spoil THAT. Suffice it to say you'll have some options. As you play, succeed, and succumb, you'll unlock items and characters for each subsequent playthrough. On top of that, items you find and unlock, enemies you encounter, and floor layouts all change with each descent – effectively making every run unique. The Binding of Isaac is one of the most highly replayable games around, with many players logging in hundreds if not thousands of hours.\n\nIt's a troubling trend lately that games have been getting the HD rerelease treatment so quickly after initial launch. The Last of Us, Tomb Raider, Sleeping Dogs, Metro – all have come out recently, all have had rereleases in fairly quick succession. It's no secret that gamers are suckers for a good dose of nostalgia, and that we're willing to pay top dollar for games we loved years ago that haven't necessarily weathered the passing of time so well. Now publishers are testing gaming goodwill with the constant stream of HD ports, definitive editions, remasters, and remakes.\n\nIt's been three years since Isaac's first appearance, and now he's back in The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. And just like way back in 2011 when he first burst onto the scene, he's stolen the show yet again. I've explained the core mechanics and features of the game in a previous paragraph, so I won't get all redundant on you. Instead I'll tell you what's new in Rebirth. New enemies, regular and boss types. New floor layouts. Bigger floors. New items. New trinkets (items you carry with you that result in an effect – Pink Eye gives you poison shots, Cancer increases number of tears, etc.). New challenge runs. More item synergies. More characters to play as. “Seeds” that allow you to choose a particular run. Hard mode for you masochists. Couch drop in/drop out co-op, ingeniously designed where a second player can take health from the first player and becomes a unique familiar, providing backup until death (as long as you have health to spare, you can respawn). Controller support. New soundtrack from Matthias Bossi and Jon Evans. More secrets. The ability to save. Chocolate ♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\n…\n\nOkay, not that last bit.\n\n\nI could go on. Needless to say they took The Binding of Isaac and its DLC, Wrath of the Lamb, and compiled it into a single rerelease. Then they went and gave it a new splash of paint and hundreds of hours of content. Graphics are spectacular and detailed, the style is lovingly Zelda inspired, the music is fresh and exhilarating, enemies pop upon death, viscerally gratifying... it's truly a delight. If I have a minor niggle, it's that Rebirth feels kind of floaty compared to Vanilla Isaac, a little too fast – but that just might take some getting used to. It certainly hasn't deterred me. For players old and new Rebirth is at once familiar and exotic, and I predict that regardless of prior experience with Isaac you'll find yourself experiencing some gaming de ja vu. It really, truly is a gamer's game; a loving homage to why we picked up controllers in the first place.\n\nBut half the fun, my uninitiated friends, is discovering all this for yourselves... the bosses (and tactics required to take them down), the items, the secrets. It's a challenging game, I won't sugarcoat it. But pressing forward and beating that first boss, getting to a new level, glimpsing the final boss... all of these milestones are as rewarding as gaming experience get, period. And once you start at it, you won't stop. That's what those save files are for.\n\nThis is the indie game of the year. This is the only indie title you really need to buy in 2014... for fans of the series, for those unfamiliar, for sentient animals, and for any extraterrestrials and apparitions within earshot. You owe it to yourself to buy this, a title retro and modern all at once. This puts all of those HD rereleases, definitive editions, and remakes to shame. This is truly a rebirth; for indie games, for players, for devs and publishers... for gaming. The bar has been raised.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Repent, every one of you, in the name of RNGesus for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of Rebirth.\n","November 4, 2014","true","494.1"," 1,771 of 2,010 people (88%) found this review helpful 581 people found this review funny","88","771","2","581","50"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HSquirrel/recommended/250900/","HSquirrel","HalfSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HSquirrel/","66 products in account","Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a remake of Binding of Isaac with new graphics, new mechanics, new monsters, new items and every aspect of the game has been enhanced. New content has been added everywhere possible, the game feels infinitely smoother, is so much nicer to play, and has many more hours of content to keep you satisfied for longer. If you enjoyed the original Binding of Isaac, Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is going to be infinitely better and I can promise instant satisfaction. This review will consist of comparisons between the original and Rebirth, what’s good, what’s bad, possible changes and just an overall look at various aspects of the game including everything that comes to mind. It is often a bit rambly, because I talk extensively about every detail I like and every component that irks me. For a full recommendation of the game and a continuation of the review, visit the last paragraph.\n\nA basic introduction to Binding of Isaac overall is an attempt to run away from your Mother who is trying to kill you. You run into the basement, where you find various items which can be beneficial, harmful or simply useless to your overall goal of surviving. You shoot the enemies with your tears to kill them while running away from them and their tears to avoid taking damage. Once you die, that run is over. The game is perma-death, so you have to start again from scratch. The game is also absolutely disgusting. There isn’t too much blood, but knowing that these monsters have lived in your dusty old basement, been transformed into ugly mutilated creatures and that this is what becomes of you as you take pills and pick up items is gross. Once you get past the horrid enemies, the game is pretty simple and is extremely fun to all who like the challenge of a game like this..\n\nThis game has a bunch of different characters, all of which have different unique aspects. Some characters are easier to play than others, which in the eyes of many people, makes those characters more fun. I wish the characters were more balanced, but it’s very rarely possible to have 10 different characters you can play as that all play with equal difficulty. There are bound to be some easier, more fun and more interesting characters, and that’s what makes them unique. Something that’s missing from the classes however, is all the characters being unique. Some of the playstyles of the characters feel too similar, and some of the things that made characters unique in the original Binding of Isaac have disappeared in Rebirth.\n\nSamson no longer starts with a soul heart along with 1 red heart, an interesting aspect of Samson that made him a challenge in the original game. Rather, he starts with 3 red hearts, probably to accompany the change in the item of Bloody Lust making it a damage output increase relative to the amount of damage taken for the entire floor. This is an interesting change, but it makes Samson more of a tanky character, similar to Magdalene, rather than the weaker character with more potential. I believe a better change would have been to give Samson a spacebar item and keep his stats the same as they are in the original, and the effect of Bloody Lust relative to the amount of kills you get while still maintaining it’s effect over the floor.\n\nLucky Foot, the item that made Cain a fun character to play in the original, has been significantly nerfed, making Cain a character that lacks a truly unique aspect. While Lucky Foot is still a luck up, a single luck increase does not have much of an effect as most items that use luck to work require a lot of it to work extremely well. If the Lucky Foot could still make the Fortune Machine work all the time, or at least most of the time, and increase the luck stat by multiple points rather than just one, Cain would be a much more interesting character to play and much more unique.\n\nA good addition to Rebirth is that all the stats are finally given good use and are recorded. The luck stat is used in everything it should, with a bunch of items now using the luck stat to perform more efficiently, all methods of gambling in the game being affected by luck and it now being shown on the pause screen when you press escape. They’ve also shown all the stats, including shot speed and luck as previously mentioned, on the pause screen, which were not there in the original game.\n\nThere are some enemies in the game that have been made impossible to fight. Bloat is a boss that shoots brimstone like lasers out of his eyes, which wasn’t too bad in the original but in this game there is no ‘tell’ (something that means he’s going to do a certain attack) for when he is going to shoot it, and before you can move out of the way, there is a laser and you’ve been hit. The same thing applies to the Lumps in the womb and the Mom eyes in the red champion Mom fight, which shoot instantly upon popping up and you have no time to react to the high speed shot. There are a lot of enemies that do similar things, and still a lot of rooms remain where it’s almost impossible to leave without taking damage.\n\nSomething I noticed that’s new in Rebirth is that everything from the original now has an equivalent. Every form of fly-related enemy now has a spider version that does the same thing, and a lot of similar aspects like that. It makes the game more uniform, because now there are a lot more interesting spiders which were missing from the original game and a lot of new versions of both flies and spiders which add a lot to the challenge of learning new elements of the game.\n\nEasily one of the best new additions in Rebirth is the ability to save your progress in a run. You can stop it at any time, close the game, and start again from where you left off at a later point. You can’t start another run while in the middle of a previous one without overriding the previous run’s data, but it’s still an extremely useful feature, since in the previous game we had to leave the game running to continue a round of BoI.\n\nOne of the more fun new additions is rooms of varying sizes. They aren’t anything like a random size, but they can now be a single normal room, as all the rooms were in the original BoI, they can be double rooms extended either horizontally or vertically, and they can even be quadruple rooms that extend in both directions. The animation for travelling through such rooms can apparently cause motion sickness, and it can be turned off by changing something in one of the files (I’m not quite sure what). Personally, I quite like the animation, and it makes moving around large rooms extremely fun.\n\nOverall, this game is easily worth the $15 if you liked the original Binding of Isaac, and at the time of the making of this review there was no DLC released (if there ever will be any), so that might be added in the future. This is an action packed perma-death roguelike with infinite replayability and hundreds of hours of gameplay to unlock all the achievements and secrets.

Fortune Teller Machine\n__________________________________________\n\nIntroduction\nAt first I didn't know what to think of this game: I've been attacked by smiling piles of poop and killed them with my tears. Meanwhile I was picking up several toxic substances and organs before I died quite fast to the creepy version of 'Snake'. My thoughts were pretty much:\n'What is this? Why... oh my god, wtf. Ah, c'mon one more try.'\n\nApproximately 157 deaths later (killed by: poop, fire, flies, severed heads, living hearts, creepy huge spiders, needles, eyeballs, headless torsos and other stuff right from a creepy horror story) I can say: This game is awesome and I can't stop playing it. It's probably the best rogue-like game that I've ever played and even after 60 hours I've seen nearly nothing of its overall content. There's just so much stuff to do and an insane amount of unlockables and secrets to discover.\n\nThe games' concept consists of random dungeons and items, a hard difficulty with permanent death and many secrets that players will stumble upon on their journey through little Isaac's basement. These aspects can be found in many other games as well. However here all of it is being combined so extremly well that it creates a game in what everything fits together perfectly. There are several characters with different stats and starting items, a ton of items, trinkets and stuff that can be found and unlocked (with their synergies they decide the run as they either make you a looser or a superhero), dozens of different room types and areas, lots of creepy enemies, bosses and many traps and secrets. In addition most of the content is only unlocked after playing through the game multiple times. Then it's possible that the former endboss isn't the real endboss anymore and that afterwards you can access even more areas. Moreover there are also special challenges, a hard mode, different endings and stuff like e.g. curses that randomly appear during a game and make everything even more uncomfortable for our little 'hero'. In 'The Binding of Isaac' every run you do really feels unique and that is what I really love about the game: It never feels repetitive.\n__________________________________________\n\nGraphics and Audio\nIn addition I like the concept and style that is somewhere between a freaky horror version of a child's book and the insane nightmare of a mad man - just in the super cute version mixed with some creepy sounds. The music is really catchy and the pixelated graphics are very well done, support the atmosphere and make the game seem even dirtier (for the pixel-haters: this filter can be turned off). The game is based around several names, items and stories from the bible and christianity and the main story is about a mother who wants to sacrifice her son to god. I also have to admit that the intro sequence was quite interesting and I really liked all the subtle story hints, it's like different puzzle pieces that fit together and every run adds another element to the whole picture.\n__________________________________________\n\nCons\nTalking about the negative points some stuff of the game could be an instant turn-off for people. The 'cute but gory ickyness' of the game is definitely very special. And it's really hard. Okay it's a rogue-like, they tend to be hard, but even for their standards this game is a tough cookie. Even more if you plan on getting all the achievements. However I don't really care about this, I just start my character, hope for some good items, get wrecked on a boss (or a regular enemy/fire/needles...) and then I just start over. And all the time it gets a bit easier as you understand the enemies, items and the boss' movements (don't worry you'll still die a lot though...).\n__________________________________________\n\nConclusion\nSo all in all I can definitely recommend this game. In my opinion every part of it fits together perfectly and the game provides a ton of fun. The new DLC 'Afterbirth' adds even more enemies, items, synergies and modes to the main game, boosting the time for unlocking everything to insane heights, there is enough stuff to do for several hundred of hours. If you don't mind the 'weird' style and the special humour the game is definitely at least a 9 out of 10.\n\nAnd let us be honest: 'The Binding of Isaac' is the only game where it's at least kind of okay to scream things like:\n\n'YES, I got cancer!!!'\n\nor\n\n'Sweet I found an injection with green looking acid! Now my tears are green and melt through poop, bones and these headless freaks like nothing!'\n\nor\n\n'Great, this pile of sh*t dropped a lunch and some hearts!'\n\n...but probably it would be better NOT to call out loud the names of all the items you get. Stuff like...\n\n'Yes, I got a Headless Baby/the head of my dead cat/Bob's Bladder now I may finally kill my mom!!! Die, die, die! *insert insane laugh here*'\n\n...would probably end with a pretty creepy police phone call by some pretty freaked out people and you spending the night in a dirty little cell. Well, it may at least have a trap door and a basement...","July 11, 2015","true","139.2"," 284 of 302 people (94%) found this review helpful 149 people found this review funny","94","284","302","149","3"

That being said here are some pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n1. Precise gameplay (in terms of movement, shooting and the bullet hell aspects.)\n2. Wide variety of bosses\n3. Randomized everything!\n4. Great soundtrack!\n5. Wide variety of characters\n6. (With Afterbirth) Interesting greed mode with cool final boss\n7. Great community!\n\nCons:\n1. Very hard to memorize what _____ Item does. (maybe its just me, idk)\n2. Ouch! Alot of bullet hell aspects. (Im bad at those)\n\nAnyway, the cons are pretty much because those are my personal issues with it.

The story took place in ancient Athens circa 415 B.C. and as we neared the end of the project we thought it would be fitting to finish it upon Grecian soil. A week into the trip and everything went to hell: an ATM swallowed my card, Expedia soft-pedaled and landed me in the ghetto, and, worst of all, my partner took too many pills and lost his damn mind. The script was suddenly a no-go. I was frightened, disoriented, and I wanted to go home.  As fate would have it, there were no last-minute flights available, either. I was stuck.\n\nI decided to make the most of my remaining week-and-a-half.\n\nWith emergency funds wired to me from my girlfriend, I hopped a ferry and sailed the Aegean. I chose to settle on Paros, a small island in the Cyclades. If you've never seen pictures, I wholly recommend that you do — it's a gorgeous hub of whitewashed homes and an epic beach. It was the latter part of winter, so it was freezing, but it also meant that I was the only tourist on the island. I found a cheap bed and breakfast (which was occupied only by me) and decided that this would be the place to get my fire rekindled. All I had with me was a small luggage full of clothes and my laptop.\n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say that The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth pretty much saved my life. In that time of enormous stress and confusion, a million miles away from friends and family, unsure if Western Union was going to be accessible this far out...that twin-stick shooter-style masterpiece kept me sane. It gave my days focus and focus gave me strength. I would reroll for Sacred Heart, get breakfast at a bakery, and Skype with my girlfriend; sit down at a coffee shop, spam a Blank Card/Jera Rune combo, and watch the waves; eat a strange fish, hang out at a bar and chat with locals, and kill Mega Satan with the Blue Baby.\n\nIt was my ivory tower, my stronghold, my Holy Mantle.\n\nI ended up having the most triumphant moment of my gaming career one evening. I had a few achievements left to unlock and the infamous Lost challenges stood in my way. For those unfamiliar, The Lost is a character with no health and no manner in which he can increase his health. In other words, you get hit once and you die. It's an obscenely difficult challenge and irredeemably mean. I mean, in Dark Souls you at least get a bonfire, right? And weapons. Anyway, the gods were on my side and after countless hours of failure I was on a roll: I had beaten Boss Rush, killed Mom and It Lives, and was a single room away from The Lamb. At this point I closed my laptop, brought it to the bar, beat The Dark Room and then celebrated by buying a round for the whole tavern. It was glorious. We drank and sang songs about California.\n\nThe Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is an outstanding RPG shooter, the best roguelike in its genre, and one of my favorite games. I could go on endlessly about how well it's designed - from the item synergies to the emotional experience of being a child in an evangelical Christian household - but I wanted to share with you my story. Do yourself a favor and play it.\n\n\n\n","May 29, 2015","true","309.6"," 243 of 269 people (90%) found this review helpful 65 people found this review funny","90","243","269","65","3"

You have a difficulty option now, you can chose to play on normal or hard. This is great, as when you played the first sometimes it got too easy with everything unlocked! You have save files now, and can resume a run where you left off. No more leaving the game running for hours as you go to the store. Full controller support, dunno about a lot of different controllers, but it works flawlessly with an xbox 360 controller. You have a lot of new exciting items and power-ups. Things that were never possible in the first. More challenges, different room sizes and types, the list goes on. I had very high hopes for this, and already this gets everything right, even better than I had expected in the first place.

The game play hearkens back to old school top-down 16-bit games.  The most notable and recognizable being the Legend of Zelda titles for inspiration.  In essence, the Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a rouge-like RPG where you play as Isaac (or one of the other unlockable characters) and you must traverse the basement of your house to escape the wrath of your mother, who hears from the voice of God and is told that you must be sacrificed.  This premise sets the tone of the game being very creepy and unsettling as you defend against all manners of your lost brothers, sisters, creatures, and other grotesque monstrosities. Eventually leading to a showdown with your own mother as well (and even beyond that if you get good at the game and carry on).\n\nWhat makes the Binding the Isaac such a great title comes from it's solid game play elements.  The game play itself is very easy to understand at first, but becomes very deep with the inclusion of the upgrades via the rogue-like elements (easy to understand + difficult to master + luck of the draw + perma-death = Isaac in a nutshell).  In order to get far into a run, you will need upgrades, and a lot of them.  Isaac by default will only be able to fire his tears at the enemies in only the four cardinal directions, but many different upgrades can alter his tears or give them new effects.  This is what can make or break a run in Binding of Isaac.  Be warned, not all the upgrades are positive, which adds to the rogue-like elements, as some are ultimately poor or are only used in certain situations and can ruin a run, resulting in failure (high risk and high reward situations are the nature of the game).  It is the element of luck the drives you to start up another run, see what upgrades and item combinations you will encounter each time.  In this remastering of Binding of Isaac, there is the heavy emphasis on item/upgrade synergy.  Coming across interesting item combinations and seeing how they interact with one another can create those overpowered moments (Brimstone plus Tammy's Head for example creates a short Brimstone shots in all directions when Tammy's Head is used) that make you feel like a god within the game, or create a silly combination where you have to work twice as hard just to clear a room.\n\nSo what if you already have played the original Binding of Isaac, what should you expect this time around in the remastering?  In short, a lot more when compared with the original.  More items and upgrades have introduced into the item pool, new bosses and enemies to encounter (for better or worse), a whole new art style very reminiscent of Gameboy Advance titles (pixel art style with a pixel smoother option in the options menu for those who prefer not to look at rigid pixels), seeded run options, 2-player local co-op play, controller support with analog stick integration, new soundtrack, three save slots, new lighting effects, and well just more to be honest.  The sheer amount that was added to the game is staggering when compared to the original.  Even at the $15 USD price, it still feels well worth the investment.  You can get several hours in just from doing a few runs and seeing how far you will get and what crazy item combinations you will come across, or what new items/characters you will unlock for later runs.  It is a challenging game no doubt, but I will admit that having one of those moments where you just barely defeat final boss of your run with only one health bar left, is nothing short of gratifying.  If you have any slight interest in the rogue-like genre, this is genuinely a great title to try and own.\n\nWorth it?: Yes\nIf on sale?: No question, yes\nAvailable on: Steam (PC/Mac/Linux), PS4, PSVita","December 1, 2014","true","35.4"," 192 of 211 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","192","211","4","6"

The original is still pretty great.\n\nHowever, comparing the original and the remastered Binding of Isaac is like the difference between a regular membrane keyboard and a mechanical keyboard. You won't notice the difference immediately, but it will stick in your mind if you go back to the original.\n\nRebirth plays much better in comparison via subtle changes to the formula. The main differences between the original and the remastered edition include 160+ new items, native gamepad support (thank jebus), a new set of gameplay and difficulty tweaks (Hard mode being a big tweak for cool kids who like to unlock more things on top of their already unlocked things), and the game engine running at 60FPS all times every times (except when you alt-tab to something else, I've noticed, but I'm not going to hit the developers for that).\n\nIt's a worthy addition to a classic, and I don't know if I can go back to playing the original now, since this supercedes it by a mile. Honestly, the only people I imagine who would complain about this are frustrated teenagers who don't get allowances and those awful pedantic ♥♥♥♥s on Steam who use the forums to complain about refunds every time the pre-orders don't get released on time.","May 18, 2015","true","3.9"," 226 of 262 people (86%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","86","226","262","12","7"

Really- what's not to like? To this day, I still play it and enjoy watching myself suffer the consequences of trying to kill Gurdy Jr. With Rebirth out, it should be no surprise that I pick this game up. Honestly, it took a little while, but I think Rebirth lived up to the hype. Close call, McMillen.\n\nGraphics\nThe visuals were changed (Edmund McMillen didn't like the original art style) to 16 bit. Some may not like that, but I sure do. I didn't really adjust to the cartoon visuals and I'm also glad to see this change. The characters still look great, the items are cool looking too, nothing wrong with any of that. One thing I noticed that was a pretty major pro was the fact that the atmosphere finally looked darker and is what the original atmosphere should have been. The darkness with the occasonal cracks of light look great and perfectly match the mood. Honestly, I'm impressed with the visuals.\n\nGameplay\nOkay, with the full controller support this game has, I freaked with joy. Now I don't have to use my handy Xbox 360 wireless controller for just Dark Souls, Skyrim, and Awesomenauts! Full controller support is a major pro for those (like myself) who use a controller a lot more often than keyboard and mouse. As for those who don't use a controller, I'm afraid I haven't tried without the controller yet. Anyway, the gameplay is much smoother than the first game. Although shooting took some time to adjust to, I got the hang of it and look at me now- beat Mom twice without taking a single heart of damage both times! Which brings me to the low point of the game- the balance this game attempts to offer is pretty messed up. Dingle is ridiculous. That thing is basically Gurdy Jr. when it comes to being unfair. It sprints faster than Gurdy Jr. sometimes and spawns enemies, too. I understand that Dingle is a solid idea when it comes to how Edmund McMillen's games are usually themed, but I think it would've been a better idea in The Caves instead. At the low point, I can kill Mom with little effort now. My recent encounter, well, I lost to her, but Azazel is a bit difficult to use if you're lacking the range that he desperately needs to win at life. That's basically the gameplay for Isaac. Not bad if you ignore the random difficulty spikes.\n\nStory\nBased off the biblical story with the same name, Binding of Isaac partially changes it but in a more video game approved fashion. Instead of the ram sacrifice, Mom (who replaces Abraham) still attempts to kill her son Isaac while he runs and hides in the basement he discovered in his room. I enjoy the game towards its end when you face the real final bosses personally. Not much to say here, but for a roguelike, Binding of Isaac: Rebirth has a pretty interesting story.\n\nAudio\nOkay, I'm saying this now. I was a huge fan of the original Isaac soundtrack. Especially the song "My Innermost Apocalypse". Anyway, the new soundtrack truthfully seemed downgraded to me. The songs aren't as catchy as they were before and the boss themes aren't as terrifying. Now don't get me wrong, I like the new normal boss theme as much as the original, but some like Mom don't sound as cool anymore. Same goes with The Caves. "Sacrificial" was overrated, so I'm glad that I don't have to listen to that awful garbage anymore. So far, The Depths has the coolest song, it perfectly matches the mood and atmosphere. The sound effects sound better in this version (come on, Isaac sounded like a 28 year old man-baby in the first game when he got hurt) and I see no flaws. So in the end, the songs are subpar, but the sound effects are pretty cool.\n\nReplayability\nCome on, anyone with eyes knows Rebirth has replayability. With all the randomness the game flawlessly executes, it should be no surprise people can log all these hours on to it with ease.\n\nVerdict\nI gave the preview for this game a 6.9. I called it "above average." I said it would take work to top its original. Within that time period of me writing the preview and this review, the game changed for the better. Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a worthy successor for the awesome roguelike and I can't wait to see where my journeys go next!\n\nGraphics- 9.5/10\nGameplay- 7.5/10\nStory- 7.0/10\nAudio- 6.5/10\nReplayability- 10/10\n\n.:8.5/10:.\n\n+Great replayability\n+Full controller support\n+Nice 16 bit visuals\n+Improved sound effects\n+Cool new items\n+Smoother gameplay\n\n-Somewhat unbalanced\n-Subpar soundtrack","November 21, 2014","true","27.4"," 338 of 411 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","338","411","5","21"

The art style, the gameplay, controller support, save files, everything you can think of is better in Rebirth. Its absolutely one of the best games I've ever played, and its only been 2 days! The game is everything I expected it to be and more. I can't say enough about how much of a pleasure it is to play this game. The original brought me into the genre of the roguelike/lite. And this one draws me in even more with all the incredible items and synergys.\n\nI've heard people complain about the soundtrack, I really don't understand why. Its much better in my opinion, its more of a background ambient sound rather than an in your face track, and I find that fits this game incredibly well. The arcade and boss music is especially good. The only complaint that I've had issue with is keyboard problems occasionally, but its so minor and rarely affects anything, at least for me.\n\nRebirth is truely one of the best games I've played, and will probably be my game of the year. What are you waiting for?! Go pick up Rebirth and play the best rougelike to date.\n\nBuy At Full Price","November 6, 2014","true","480.0"," 115 of 122 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","115","122","0","13"

The main character, Captain Soap Price, callsign Isaac, is on a mission to tackle the deep-rooted fears that all humans have of ungodly things such as poop and basements. Taking a bold step away from a tried and true formula, CoD:BW is no longer a first person shooter. Players do not play as a badass soldier anymore either. In order to connect with the fanbase on a more personal level, the head of Nintendo decided that CoD:BW would place players in the shoes of the average Call of Duty player: a naked child who hates their mother (but ♥♥♥♥s mine all the time apparently).\nHowever, what is most surprising about this CoD is the lovely message that the campaign has. By tackling his fears head on, he dies, meaning he can't be afraid anymore.That's some A+ Ernest Hemingway ♥♥♥♥ right there folks. Thanks to Isaac being a mix of Wolverine and Dr. Evil, however, he can try to kill his mother over and over until he succeeds and gets her to listen to his mixtape. This has the not-so-unexpected result of killing his mom again. Seriously ♥♥♥♥ off with your mixtapes.\nAs you can tell by the pros and cons that I've listed above, this game should be GOTY 2015-2020.\n\nRemember kids, if you throw poop and shoot eyeball sperm at your own mother the Devil spits in God's face.","January 1, 2015","true","24.7"," 416 of 540 people (77%) found this review helpful 543 people found this review funny","77","416","540","543","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_kemosabe/recommended/250900/","el_kemosabe","El Kemosabe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_kemosabe/","1115 products in account","Introduction\nThe game we all love to hate and one of the best indie titles of 2015, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is the hit remake of The Binding of Isaac which released in 2011. TBOIR is a brutal top-down ARPG rogue-like where you play as Isaac, a child who has been thrown into the basement by his mother who believes that she is doing what god has asked of her. Unfortunately for Isaac, this is no ordinary basement and the enemies you find yourself faced with are grotesque and deadly, the stuff of nightmares.\n\nRebirth improves on the original game is almost all aspects. The game’s visuals have become high quality, hand drawn pixel graphics, replacing the flash game-esque graphics of the first game, performance has been drastically improved, new enemies and items have been added as well a few other changes. Rebirth improves on TBOI enough to make it a completely separate game and with the Afterbirth expansion it only gets better.\n\nPresentation\nAs I said in the previous section, gone are the low quality graphics reminiscent of flash games, making way for new high quality hand drawn graphics. The visuals are absolutely fantastic, everything is incredibly well done and looks sharp. The UI now takes up a lot less screen space and sticks to parts of the screen that usually aren’t needed during gameplay. The UI does actually look good and keeps up the same design as the rest of the game. The main menu is still the same style as the first game, it looks as though it has been drawn by a child and this fits perfectly with the story of the game.\n\nGameplay\nThe core gameplay of TBOIR is that of your standard twin-stick shooter. You control Isaac’s movement with one thumbstick (in the case of the controller) or the WASD keys and you control his attacks with the other thumbstick or the Arrow Keys. Isaac’s default attack is to shoot tears at enemies because when you’re locked in a basement full of horrible creatures, tears are one of the few things you have in abundance. However, you aren’t stuck with Isaac’s tears. The main appeal of TBOIR is the huge amount of game changing items the game has for you to unlock and then use (there are of course items you can find from the get go but often the best items have unlock requirements). Each and every item affects the gameplay in some way, whether that be an item which increases the frequency of key drops or an item that makes you fire giant tears that shrink the further away they get from you. The items don’t just have an impact on the gameplay though, the vast majority of them come with a visual change to your character. While these will sometimes be overwritten by other items, you can get some pretty awesome looking versions of Isaac if you get a cool combo of items. On the subject of getting a cool combination of items, you can get synergies as well as transformations in the game. Synergies are when you get two items which when combined benefit you even more than they would when used separately, so if you have an item which can be used to easily destroy rocks such as Thunder Thighs and you have Lucky Rock which means destroyed rocks drop one coin, you can rack a fair few coins very quickly. Transformations occur when you collect three or more collectables that are somehow linked to a certain character, once you’ve transformed you get special abilities on top of all of the abilities added by the items you’ve collected.\n\nObviously one of the main reasons to keep playing the game is to get all the game’s unlockables, these unlocks aren’t just items though, there are new characters for you to unlock too. While a lot of items are unlocked by simply beating a certain boss or beating a run of the game, most of them require you to do specific things and this translates to characters as well. Character unlocks require you to do certain things within a run, such as collect a specific number of coins or have a certain number of heart containers. Item unlocks often have something to do with what kind of object the item is, for example the Lucky Rock item is unlocked by destroying 100 rocks. Boss related items, such as the Head of Krampus, require you to kill the boss for the first time. Unless you follow a guide for specific items, most unlocks will come randomly during your runs as you meet the requirements for the items.\n\nThe basement is randomly generated each time you play and is made up of preset room designs which vary in size, the size of the room changes how many enemies you’ll fight. As well as having preset room designs the rooms themselves have a different design depending on which floor you’re on. There are certain rooms you will always find though, all but the last two ‘normal’ floors have a treasure room (one free item) and an item shop where you can spend your coins on items or consumables (hearts to replace your health, tarot cards with varying effects, room keys etc). On some floors you’ll also find arcades, vaults, bedrooms, challenge rooms and depending on how your run is going, Devil rooms and Angel rooms among others. Sometimes when you start new floors they’ll have special conditions affecting your ability to play in some way, this could include an XL floor (doubles the size of the floor including number of boss rooms, treasure rooms etc), a dark floor (there’s only a small light around Isaac) and a few others including ones where you have no mini-map or you can’t see your health.\n\nMiscellaneous While the soundtrack is great it just isn’t quite as good as the original game’s soundtrack though I can’t put my finger on why, this is pretty much the only way in which TBOIR is in any way inferior to TBOI in my eyes.\nRebirth adds over one hundred and sixty new items to those that were seen in TBOI and it also adds a few new characters. Afterbirth adds even more to both as well as slightly modifying some of the items.\nTBOIR has two game modes, normal and hard. Hard mode slightly changes how enemies are chosen for a given floor and is also necessary for some item unlocks. Afterbirth adds another game mode too, Greed mode.\nRebirth now has daily runs which increase the game’s replay value once you’ve 100% completed it.\nIn case it’s not obvious, this game easily has several hundred hours of gameplay due to the huge amount of content.\nVerdict\nEssential Purchase.\n\nRebirth not only offers us a high quality remake of the original game, it gives the player hundreds of hours of new content which can be enjoyed alongside the game’s revamped and improved design, new items, characters and room layouts. If you like rogue-likes and twin-stick shooters this is a no-brainer, hell it’s a no-brainer even if you don’t.\n\nEl K.","January 11","true","103.3"," 106 of 115 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","106","115","4","8"

But I feel that some people might want me to justify this statement (especially considering how captivating The Binding of Isaac already was) so here we go:\n\nI've played the original BoI for some 100 hours and have achieved the Platinum God! achievement. Hence I consider myself experienced enough to know what I am talking about to say the least.\n\nSince "The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth" is more or less an overhaul of the original BoI I will try to point out in how far this game is different from its predecessor and where there are similarities:\n\nThe Binding of Isaac offered 100 items to collect. Players that bought the DLC Wrath of the Lamb could extend this collection to almost 200 items.\nRebirth offers close to 350 items, aforesaid 200 of which are the same as in Wrath of the Lamb. This leaves us with ~150 new items.\nThe same goes for trinkets, "pick-ups" and nearly everything else.\nThere are various new types of enemies, bosses and new room types that seem elaborate and reasonably extend the gameplay - the "dice room" for example can change the fate of an entire run.\nRebirth also provides twice as many challenges as BoI. There are easier and harder ones depending on which items you are equipped with from the start and how many dungeons you have to beat in order to complete that particular challenge.\nAdditionally there are new soundtracks which I liked a lot better than the original ones and new voice acting for old bosses.\n\nThis game of course features Steam achievements. However I find kind of weird that a part of the achievements are exactly the ones you could achieve in BoI and Wrath of the Lamb. On the other hand this only demonstrates how similar it still is to the original.\n\nSumming it all up I think you can say that The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is almost no different in gameplay than The Binding of Isaac and Wrath of the Lamb.\nWhere there was potential to enhance and add new features it has been done.\nIf someone ever felt there was a "lack of content" they shouldn't have anything to wish for anymore.\nI recommend it for both players who experienced Wrath of the Lamb and/or the original and players that are new to this genre/franchise.\n\nOne last thing: They also implemented a "Hard" mode. Because that's what BoI always needed. A bloody mode that is even harder. Jokes aside, I like having it.","November 17, 2014","true","199.0"," 88 of 95 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","88","95","4","8"

It costs three times more than the original (without counting DLC, Wrath of the Lamb). Question is: Is it any worth?\n\nOh yeah, it's absolutely worth of all the pennies I paid from it\n\nSuper smooth; due new engine, it works very smoothly. Fantastic!\nLocal Co-Op; Haven't tried, but it's always a plus!\nNew items & item combinations. Be creative. Break the game for your benefit!\nNew enemies & bosses. More blood to splatter!\nNormal and Hard modes; True, I haven't tried Hard yet, but for more hardcore group of players, it must mean something (right?).\nMore characters; More reasons to play! Play as Eden, who has all stats and items randomed!\n...And so much more. Animated cutscenes. More bodyhorror.\n\nThe only thing which so far isn't as good as in original Isaac is soundtrack in my opinion. However, it's not that bad either now that I've played Rebirth more and it definitely fits here, I just find Baranowsky's soundtrack much more enjoyable. Points on music playing in Arcade, though!\n\nAnd for recommendation part, it's bit... tricky. Chances that you loved original Isaac, you already own this. Chances are that if you didn't care for original Isaac, you really don't care about this either. But new to Roguelike genre?

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is what you think of when a game lives up to its hype. The creators—Edmund McMillen and Nicalis—have done a great job of designing not only a great remake of the original, but a great game worthy of its own merit. You should think less of Rebirth as a remake, and more of it as a pseudo-sequel that just happens to have all of the original content a la the Pokemon franchise for a similar experience.\n\nThe gameplay, which is a dungeon-crawling twinstick shooter just like the original, has enough variety that every run will be different. There's permanent death in the game, so be warned—the game is difficult and you will die, but your overarching progress will be saved. That's part of the draw for a lot of the community, since you start from scratch with each 30 minute to 1 hour run.\n\nAll in all, I can't recommend this game enough, and if you're a fan of the original you will most likely adore this one. My pick for "Game of the Year" for 2014.\n\n\n","December 25, 2014","true","221.7"," 77 of 85 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","77","85","4","3"

It's remade exactly how I would want. Gameplay is so smooth, it's beautiful, and it has all the content from the Original and Wrath + more. This is EXACTLY how I want to play the game, and I'm glad I stopped playing BOI to wait for this.\n\nNow on to the Ost...\n\nI think the issue is that the Danny B soundtrack just fit the game SO well. I think it was nearly a fluke how the music just gave you that extra sense of being creeped out and feeling bad for the denizens of the Basement and below. Sure, he's ultra talented and I'm sure he set out for the creepy vibe, but who would have thought how perfectly it would set the mood for the game.\n\nFor me, the music would actually trigger an emotion to what I was seeing...thinking about these poor kids down there having to live in their own feces, getting sick, forming growths and turning into monsters. It actually made me feel a bit ill and disturbed. I'm not sure if that's good or bad but it's certainly rare in both games and film to accomplish that.\n\nBasically, I think if it wasn't for the Original OST, people would be amazed with the new one. It's awesome, but you can't recapture COMPLETELY what the first one did. It comes damn close though.","November 9, 2014","true","57.4"," 72 of 82 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","72","82","0","6"

Developers Edmund McMillen[vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net] and Tyrone Rodriguez (Nicalis) teamed up this time (instead of Florian Himsl) to make this epic, Zelda-inspired rogue-like RPG, and what they have done with it is astounding. Starting as a 3DS port of the original Isaac back in 2012, Edmund changed Rebirth's intention and made it into and remaster-of-sorts, adding 200+ items, enemies, bosses, secret floors, seeds, cheats, challenges - you name it. Now, let's get into the details\n\nGameplay: 10/10\n+Extremely fun and satisfying\n+Bullet-hell\n+Your strategy will evolve and you'll become more intrigued\n+Items change your experience with each play\n+Characters vary, but are all fun to play\n\nGraphics: 10/10\n+Stunning pixel work\n+Runs well in fullscreen, no stretching\n+Great amount of detail put into environment (especially bosses)\n+Bugs run around the environment often\n+Has the darkness of an actual basement, how Isaac was meant to look\n\nDifficulty: 9/10\n+Very hard\n+Hard mode is even harder\n+Final bosses are challenging\n+Unforgiving, but fair\n+/-I feel like this game is easier than the original Isaac\n\nSound: 8/10\n+That dark, eerie soundtrack that is totally suiting for the game\n+Track layering when fighting enemies\n+Great monster sounds\n+Retro item pickup sounds\n-Soundbytes get repetitive\n\nLasting Appeal: 10/10\n+I have approximately one buttload of hours into this game (I also have it on Vita) and I'm still finding new things\n+Huge amount of seeds and items will always bring you a new experience\n+Trying to beat all the final bosses with one character will take a while, let alone all of them\n+Just try to beat all of the challenges without getting lucky\n+This game has like everything; it's just too addicting\n\nSingle-Player: 10/10\n+Literally, the best gameplay ever\n+Forces you to think\n+You MUST do things in the correct order\n+Constantly dodging "bullets" makes this game intense and stress-inducing\n+Makes you feel bad because you die a lot, and it displays your win streak\n\nStory: 8/10\n+Simple, understandable\n+Very dark and sadistic (based of Book of Genesis)\n+Told through an iconic intro cutscene featuring phenomenal narration by Matthias Bossi\n+Ending cutscenes each explain themselves simply (they also look great and are very sadistic)\n-The game's mostly about gameplay, so cutscenes are the only time you'll experience story\n\nMultiplayer: 10/10\n+All the fun of single-player\n+Player 2 gets to spawn as a baby to assist player 1 in ways never seen in Isaac before\n+~100 babies, most of which are unique\n+Spawn in/out causes for added strategy\n+You thought it was gonna be easier with 2 players...\n\nOptimization: 10/10\n+Should run at 60 fps on just about every computer that came out after 2009-ish\n+Runs well in both fullscreen and windowed mode\n+Connect your computer to your TV and the game still looks great (no gradient problems)\n+Works fantastic with a keyboard\n+Also works fantastic with a controller (there was no controller support in the original)\n\nContent: 10/10\n+Amazing amount of depth to the game\n+Billions of seeds and item combinations\n+Large amount of items\n+Secret floors\n+Tons of achievements\n\nOVERALL RATING: 95/100\n\nAuthor's Notes: This is my second favorite game.

In the biblical tale of "Binding of Isaac", God tests Abraham by commanding him to prove his devotion to Him. To do this he must sacrifice his son, Isaac. Just as Abraham is about to end Isaac's life, God demands for Abraham to stop and let his son live, sacrificing a lamb instead.\n\nChristian religious symbols, items and connotations saturate The Binding of Isaac game. And yet the handling of such sensitive material is not mocking towards it's inspiration and it's not reverent. Instead, it's a fine line and one balanced masterfully. Only the most cynical Christians and non-Christians will find anything to take offense over.\n\nEdmund McMillen, the up and coming indie superstar behind the rage inducing Super Meat Boy has released his most fun and inspired game yet. Being the best top-down shooter doesn't hurt either....but I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nSteam users most likely already know the sheer awesomeness that is The Binding of Isaac, but who knew that was just a taste of what Mr. McMillen had brewing up in his devilish head, next to a slab of meat and bandages. The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth feels like a remastered version of the original Isaac with all of the content quadrupled, like a triple fudge cake with chocolate frosting and a chocolate core made of chocolate ice-cream....at least, I think it's chocolate.\n\nFor those new to the game, Isaac, at it's heart, is a top-down shooter that has "borrowed" so much from the 8-bit Zelda I get the feeling a Nintendo lawsuit could be on it's way at any moment. For example, keys drop from enemies to unlock doors and chests, bombs are used to remove rocks and you gain more hearts as you progress through the stages.\n\nIn the basement with Isaac are a motley crew of deformed monsters who look like they were torn from a child's nightmare and are now dragging the floor with their ripped tendons and ligaments. Isaac keeps the fiends at bay by flinging tears like spears. Even horribly deformed monsters don't like being exposed to Ebola and other diseases by having bodily fluids flung at them. And to top it off, a massive boss resides at the end of the stage, guarding it's domain with a fierce tenacity. Isaac must maim and kill the beast so he can pass through to the next stage unmolested.\n\nDon't think TBOI is just a crying simulator like Dark Souls. Isaac features rogue-like elements, which add random items which change nearly any and every game mechanic in some twisted, incredible way. The dungeons are different every trip through their dreary halls. These stages will be braved many times and the variety keeps things fresh and challenging. Like a room with trip lasers and machine-gun mounted turrents that change places every time you move out of their range.\n\nThe game mechanics are perfectly balanced, adding to the fun of the game. Do you use your last, precious bomb to free a key, which will open the item room? Is that prized key worth the extra heart which may keep you alive during the next boss fight? Balanced risk / reward scenarios such as these are what makes the game such a joy to play.\n\nNow, let's talk about the elephant in the room. Or more accurately, the elephant poo in the room. Look, I don't know what Edmund McMillen was going through when developing Isaac and I'm pretty sure I don't want to know for the fear of becoming psychologically scarred but there are a lot......a LOT of piles of crap EVERYWHERE. In nearly every room, of every stage, throughout the entire game. There are poo monsters, poo bosses, poo power-ups and even special piles of poo with unique properties.\n\nIt's one thing to see Isaac murder an enemy, pull it's heart out and devour it like Jeffrey Dahmer, but it's totally another to see him pull a heart out of a pile of poo and pop it in his mouth. Those are the kinds of things you don't want to see because the nightmares won't stop, even after "chats" with your psychologist.\n\nNot all items are power-ups though. Some will grab your balls, wrap them around your neck and force you to finish the game that way. It's a gamble picking up an item you don't recognize, which will happen often as there are more items in the game than pitfall deaths in Super Mario. It's like bobbing for apples in a tank filled with chocolate eggs, apples and dead fish.\n\nItems themselves are like little people. Some will instantly tell you who they are and what they do but others will require you to notice whats changed or missing when you review your security footage. It's an homage to older games when the developers didn't explain anything about their little cartridge of frustration and expected gamers to figure things out on their own. Half the fun of Isaac comes from discovering an innocent item hidden away only to find out later that it eats feces and likes to mouth-kiss.\n\nTBOI is sort of like doing drugs. At first, you're just casually smoking a joint on the weekend with friends. But before the moon passes many times, you're laying in a building's doorway begging for money and stealing from your family just to feed your fix once more....alone and desperate.\n\nWith Isaac, playing a casual game here and there will do just fine. After all, you just want to beat the game. But then it creeps up on you. You'll come so close, just to have TBOI laugh at your feeble attempts. Not to spoil too much, but you CAN'T just stop after the credits. Play it more; let it fill your veins, satisfying your cravings and curiosity.\n\nIf limitless playtime isn't enough, there are bonus challenge levels which give you either a fun or debilitating set of items and task you with beating the game. One may require you with beat the game in near total darkness, except for a tiny light around your character. Others will give you a laser which kills everything in range, like a mother's angry looks. Only the most skilled of the elite players will be able to complete everything here and are really a well-thought out and fun bonus in a game already packed full of content.\n\nI don't mean to read too much into the meaning of the game, but it seems to mirror the story of life. You'll have some good things and bad things happening to us but in the end, you'll go through a lot of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nFor the first time I've not had real negative quibbles, problems, and complaints with a game. Even after looking under every rock and corpse. That's as rare as finding a platinum Cheerio in your cocoa puffs.

It adds so much content to the game.\n\nThere's a lot of RNG, but there are quite a few things you can use to your advantage in order to turn a bad run around in your favor. I also appreciate the relatively short amount of time it takes to complete (or fail) a run. Some roguelikes can take hours, which makes failing so much more frustrating. My complete Isaac runs average around 40-50 minutes a piece.","January 2, 2015","true","45.5"," 48 of 54 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","48","54","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hotdogbitchface/recommended/250900/","Hotdogbitchface","Hotdog Bitchface","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hotdogbitchface/","2391 products in account","NOTE: This is a shortened review without screenshots.For my full review, please visit RealGamerReviews[realgamerreviews.com]\n\n\nIntro:Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a remake of the original BOI, which was released in 2011 to much fanfare. It plays as a 2D, top-down rogue-like dungeon-crawler, but what makes it so special is the huge amount of content and unlockables, making each run through the game unique and incredibly addictive. This might be my favourite game of 2014, and I would recommend that everyone give this game a spin.\n\nStory:The story is loosely based on the biblical story that shares the same name. The narrative is told in the form of a brief stick figure-drawn animated video which plays at the start of the game. The gist of it is that you play as Isaac, a normal infant sitting around doing what a baby does whilst his mother sits around watching Christian broadcasts on TV. One day, his mother begins to hear voices from God, telling her that her son has been corrupted and must be killed. Your job is to guide Isaac through the basement to escape your deranged mother.\n\nGameplay:Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a 2D, top-down, twin-stick shooter with rogue-like elements. Left stick/D-pad on the controller (WASD on keyboard) controls the characters movement whilst the right stick/face buttons (Arrow keys on keyboard) each control one of four directions that your character shoots in. Shoulder buttons are relegated to the use of items. Full configuration is also available if the initial lot didn’t tickle your fancy. Controls are tight and responsive – getting hit by anything in this game will always be your fault, never the game’s controls for screwing you over.\nDuring each level, you travel from room to room (which are generally locked until each enemy in the room is defeated), killing enemies, collecting items and ultimately fighting a boss. Defeating the boss drops an item and unlocks the next level down, going from the basement all the way to the necropolis (and beyond – but telling you where would be a slight spoiler).\n\nCollectables that are found in each level are randomised, leading for a very unique experience each time you boot up the game. These collectables are divided into a number of groups, including items, trinkets, tarot cards and pills, each of which changes your character in some way. The game contains hundreds of items, which are randomised for each playthrough, making every playthrough a unique one.\n\nDeath is permanent in this game. Therefore, when your character dies (or alternatively, you complete one run by “finishing the game”, you lose all items and begin again at the start of the game. However, items and characters that you unlock through a single playthrough can now appear as the random items that can occur in subsequent playthroughs, making successful playthroughs matter. The game boasts 10 unlockable characters in addition to Isaac, each of which is unlocked when certain conditions are met (i.e. Cain is unlocked once you have 55 coins in your possession in a single playthrough). Each character has its own statistics (health, damage, speed) as well as starting items. Whilst some of the characters differ in somewhat subtle ways, other characters such as Azazel offer a very different approach to the game, due to the fact that he begins with zero red hearts (meaning that he cannot gain hearts to heal like most other characters) and the fact that he flies and shoots a short-range and damaging beam rather than the round tears that Isaac shoots. This character variation, in addition to the hundreds of unlockable items, helps to keep the game fresh and interesting, even after many, many hours and playthroughs.\n\nRebirth offers a decent amount of challenge, particularly for players who are new to the franchise. Whilst the earlier rooms are fairly straightforward, later levels become increasingly more difficult, although never unfair. Every runthrough in Rebirth is beatable, although some runs are considereably easier than others due to the randomised items you find and the enemies you run into. With that said most runs with average items remain fairly difficult from start to finish, which requires the player to remain vigilant and rewards tight play.\n\nThe game offers a large variety of enemies, each with their unique attacks and patterns. After playing the game for over 60 hours (split between Steam and the Vita version), I still encountered enemies in the game that I had never seen before. The game also offers a decent number of different bosses which appear at the end of each level. There are plenty of unique bosses, all with fairly unique and interesting patterns of attack which must be exploited in order to succeed. Later levels also have more difficult, “champion” versions which turn up the challenge and keeps you on your toes. Unfortunately, some of the bosses (such as Monstro) become stupendously easy after dispatching of them many … many times. This is worsened by the fact that these bosses usually appear towards the start of the game, where your character is at its weakest, therefore requiring a longer period of time to beat.\n\nFor those itching for some extra challenge, Rebirth gives you the option of playing “hard mode”, which offers more difficult enemies, less health/items and more frequent curse levels, which impose a random detrimental effect on the player. In addition, Rebirth offers 20 unique challenge modes which each impose a handicap on the player at the start of the run. Players playing on the hard difficulty or with challenges are rewarded with unlockable items (for subsequent playthroughs) that are otherwise unavailable to players.\nRebirth also boasts an all co-operative mode. The second player steals a heart from the first player and plays as a flying baby that can attack and take damage, but is unable to use or collect items for the player. It’s very reminiscent of Tails from the earlier 2D Sonic the Hedgehog games. The game does a great job at not allowing the co-op mode of the game throw off the difficulty-balance like many other titles with co-op do.\n\nPresentation\nRebirth sheds the flash-based engine (used in the original BOI) for a 16-bit sprite-based engine… Think The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past with a far gloomier and gorier aesthetic. Whether or not it looks better than the original BOI is debatable, but the limits set by the flash format have been removed. Most notably, this gets rid of the regular frame drops that plagued the original game.\n\nThe aesthetic is cartoony, but also dark, gloomy and gory. You’ll encounter some absolutely disturbing enemies, including skinless bodies, babies with bleeding eyes and even a living foetus – which would be terrifying if not for the comical nature in which they are drawn.\n\nMusic is also appropriately eerie, although some tracks are definitely more memorable than others. It's adequate, but for the most part isn't anything special. Despite loving this game to death, I can't say I've ever wanted to listen to the music outside the game.\n\nOverall impression: As a person that never really played much of the original Binding of Isaac, I was pleasantly surprised to find out just how much I loved this game. Despite the relatively simple premise of the game, the game offers so much content, and 40-or-so hours into the game, I still haven’t unlocked a majority of the items and more importantly, I still have the desire to play it… a lot. There’s a lot of bang for your buck in this title, and the improvements and additions to the original game make it a strict upgrade, and a worthwhile purchase even for those who have played the original to death.","November 30, 2014","true","238.1"," 66 of 83 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","66","83","0","2"

The gameplay is like the dungeons in the original Legend of Zelda for the NES, but it's a good bit harder and you only have one life to do it all in.  If you die, you start at the very beginning, pretty much empty handed. The levels and pickups are randomly generated, so it's a different game every time you play it.  Even the bosses are randomly picked from a pool of possibilities, and each boss has several different versions that range from easy to very tough.  There's a lot of variety here even though the game itself is simple and straightforward.  You'll get many many quality hours out of this thing.  Even if you already have the original, this one improves almost everything.  It's smoother, prettier, harder, and there's a lot of new enemies and items that change the gameplay in significant ways.  The only thing I really miss about the original game is the soundtrack.  The new music is fine, but I prefer the original score.  Other than that, this is one of my favorite games ever, and I've played a whole lot of them.","November 19, 2014","true","275.1"," 45 of 52 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","45","52","0","0"

The main difference with this version is the lack of mouse controls. There are also an added 3 final bosses and 17 new normal bosses.\n\nRebirth is a top down 2D dungeon crawler where the player controls Isaac. You venture through your mothers basement, and then moving onto Necropolis, Catacombs and even your mothers own womb. Rebirth also introduces local co-op, which is something I always like to see in games.\n\nThe dungeons look similar to that of Legend of Zelda, and the procedurally generated levels means you will never have the same run twice.  In each dungeon room, you must eliminate all of the enemies before being allowed to move onto the next room. Along the way, players will collect money to buy equipment, find keys which unlock treasure chests and find power ups and weapons to increase Isaacs’s power.\n\nOnce you reach the latter stages of Rebirth, the difficulty really ramps up, and you will find yourself becoming very annoyed at yourself, but somehow you cannot stop yourself from playing because Isaac is such an addictive game.\n\nYou can complete a full run in Isaac in about 45 minutes give or take a little, so I've finished roughly 5 or 6 runs throughout my seven hours of playing, and each run I am still unlocking new power ups, characters and weapons to use in future runs.\n\nBasically, if you don't have any Binding of Isaac games, you need to pick up Rebirth, it's everything the original game had, but done a lot better. This type of game you can pick up and play with ease, do a quick run here and there and you'll still have new things to find and explore.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/supergamerhero/recommended/250900/","supergamerhero","Level1Magikarp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/supergamerhero/","110 products in account","The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth (or sometimes just called "Rebirth", which I shall call it for this review) is a rogue like RPG made by Nicalis (who made Cave Story remakes and a VVVVVV port) under the supervision of Edmund McMillen, that is a sequel to the 2011 game, The Binding of Isaac, made by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl.\n\nRebirth, unlike the original, has much more content and much more replayability than the first game, adding new enemies, bosses, items, and characters for you to play with thanks to Rebirth being made on a non-Flash engine. Basically it is the original Binding of Isaac along with the DLC, Wrath of the Lamb with much more smoother gameplay, added features, and even more things to find and experiment with.\n\nThe story is the same as in the original : Isaac and his mother are living alone in a house, Isaac playing with his toys like a normal kid would, and his mother listening to Christian broadcasts on the television. However, Isaac's life takes a sudden turn for the worse when his mother starts hearing the voice of God himself, saying that her son has been corrupted. His mother, who wants to cleanse Isaac of all his sin, takes all of Isaacs belongings, even the clothing on his back, and locks him in his room, shutting him out from the outside world. However, God wants Isaac's mother to prove her faith in him by sacrificing Isaac, so his mother grabs a kitchen knife and starts walking to Isaac's room. Isaac, in a state of panic, starts to search around his room for a way out, which he finds as a door to the basement. Just as Isaac's mother bursts into the room, Isaac jumps into the dark abyss, and that is where your game begins.\n\nFirst off, the graphics in Rebirth are largely improved from the original, having 16-bit like graphics that make Rebirth look more retro than a sequel. Although it looks 16-bit, once the player starts to move around and get into the game, the game actually looks very smooth.\n\nBeing made on a non-Flash engine, Rebirth also runs very very smoothly, even when there is a ton of enemies or items on the screen, unlike in the original where having too many items on the screen would cause the game to lag or even crash all together.\n\nGameplay wise, Rebirth plays very similarly to the original, go around rooms, kill enemies that spawn in the rooms, pick up items, upgrade your character and fight the boss on the floor, then go to the next floor. Occasionally, after beating a floor, the player may find a new room before they go to the next floor that contains either a Devil Room or a Angel Room. The Devil Room allows players to permenantly trade in their health containers for various items, while the Angel Room gives the player a item for free. However, this game is not very forgiving, so expect to die a lot, not as much as Dark Souls, but a pretty decent amount.\n\nThere are a ton of new items in the game that have many different effects, as well as items from the original. As you fight your way through your foes, you may find money, keys, bombs, health, chests, cards, trinkets, or even upgrade or reusable items. For example, one of the newer items, Chocolate Milk, allows you to charge up shots before releasing the direction you wish to fire your shot, increasing its attack and shot size. These items can actually synergize with one another, causing very deadly combos that can make your run to defeat Mom much more easier. For example, Polyphemus, which makes your shots much more damaging, larger, and be able to pass through enemies if the shot kills them in one hit if your damage rating is higher while reducing the fire rate of your tears, combined with Chocolate Milk, can make a incredibly large and much much more damaging.\n\nMuch like the original, every time you start up a new game, all the items, enemies, and upgrades will be different. It literally cannot be the same game twice. However, thanks to the new Seed mode, you can write down the Seed of a run you have been doing, input it when you start a new game, and the map and all the upgrade room items will stay the same. However, doing this will disable any achievements you can earn for that run, which unlocks more items for you to find.\n\nThe sound has also been redone and the music is pretty upbeat, from the start of your adventures in Basment 1, to the retro beats of the Arcade, to the intense boss battle music, it makes you feel like you can actually make it to the end and beat Mom. Enemies also have some new sounds, as well as some more damage sounds when you get hurt.\n\nOverall, Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a major major improvement to the original, and is worth every penny. If you managed to read this far, I highly suggest you play the game yourself and experience the struggles that is Isaac's escape against Mom.","November 24, 2014","true","82.1"," 38 of 45 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","38","45","0","0"

Putting it simple, I should have played the original game more. I legitimately like BOI:R.\n\nNow for those of you who have made it this far into the review, let me break down what I personally think of eacha spect of the game. Starting off, we have the story at hand. Upon booting up the game, I was treated to a pixelated version of the original opening cutscene of BOI, essentially making it clear to me that BOI:R is more of a remake of the original game, rather than a sequel, which I don't mind. The same can be said about the rest of the game's story, which, again, is no problem to me. I'm here to play a rogue-like, not spend 40 hours trying to follow some kind of worthwhile re-imagining of the bible with only an hour's worth of gameplay. Moving on.\n\nThe graphical style of the game is vastly different from the original, both with the UI, and the game itself. The UI, instead of being a top-bar Legend of Zelda-style status menu, has been overhauled to show you your map, bombs, keys, health, etc. as a minimally-intrusive overlay, which I think works a lot better than the original UI style. The game, itself, has taken on a more pixelated version of the original game's art style, which I'm a bit torn about, but I can just turn the Filter Option on if it ever starts bothering me. Regardless of whether or not I use the filter, the lighting and particle effects will not change, and given how amazing they look (like, no joke), I honestly do not mind that at all.\n\nOnto the gameplay, which I don't have too much to say about (he lied). The controls are basically the same, just with- OH MY GOD, NO MOUSE SUPPORT. INSTANT DISLIK- no. Honestly, I really like using the WASD and Arrow keys in BOI in general. The idea is to use them in perfect unison to "guide" your shots, especially around obstacles that prevent you from getting a clear, safe shot against an enemy that could easily wreck your crap. I personally think that adding mouse controls to the game would just take away that skillset-building process that added to the game's fun. What I do like about BOI:R over its original coutnerpart, is the various items, characters, rooms, and item combinations that have been added. Seriously, it's things like ORBITING BRIMSTONE LASERS that make the game more enjoyable. On top of the new content, you also have various challenges that you can unlock that let you play through the entire game under unique circumstances (Because there weren't enough life-stealing doors to begin with). Overall, I'd say it's a worthwhile improvement over the original game.\n\nSo to sum it all up, rather than call BOI:R a carbon-copy of the original game, I invite anyone who has read this far to give this game a try, just to see what they've done to improve the overall experience of getting killed by a drop of blood that came from a hulking huge mass of flesh, all because you're re-living a story from the Bible.  The only thing I've had issues with, thus far, are occasional crashes. I've also read reviews from people who can't even boot the game up, but I'm confident that that will quickly be fixed. Otherwise, on that note, I'm gonna go murder everything in sight with Azazel.","November 4, 2014","true","51.8"," 35 of 44 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","35","44","0","0"

If you liked the original, you can stop reading here and just get Rebirth immediately: it has everything that made the first one awesome, only better and with bucketloads of new content.\n\nIf you're new to the franchise, this is a 2D dungeon crawler with procedurally-generated levels. You start as a young boy named Isaac (many more characters will be unlocked as you progress) and your goal is to survive as far as possible, ideally getting to the last available level (again, more levels will be unlocked as you play and replay the game). Many a hideous foe awaits on the way, including a boss on each level. Isaac fights by shooting tears, several parameters of which can be upgraded with items: range, speed, fire rate, damage and shape, to only name a few basic ones.\n\nUpgrades are key: they do not only affect tears but also your amount of heart containers, your speed and such; they may also give you some very interesting special abilities, some of which will require that you dramatically change your style of playing. The random nature of the game means that the combination of items you will find will be different on every run. There is already a great number of items that can show up on your first run, but more and more will be unlocked as you clear various parts of the game with different characters and complete some of the twenty available Challenges.\n\nAll of this is extremely well-executed. The controls are now very precise, which takes away what may well have been the most frustrating aspect of the original Isaac. The flash engine has been ditched along with its painful lags, and as a whole I think the aesthetics have been vastly improved. The new enemies and bosses fit very well within the game's atmosphere. The learning curve is quite steep, but the game felt a little less brutally difficult than it used to be... at first. Clearing it a certain number of times will make it harder and unlock subsequent levels which are sure to test your skills and patience. If that isn't enough to satisfy your hunger for hardcore, there is now a Hard mode. Some challenges are incredibly difficult as well.\n\nThe original had a fantastic soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky; I have to admit that Rebirth, which features quality ambient music by electronica duo Ridiculon, is slightly less memorable in that respect. The new music fits well within the game but its ambient nature means you tend not to pay attention to it, and it's definitely not something I would listen to outside of the game.\n\ntl:dr A++, would recommend again.","January 28, 2015","true","358.8"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","23","24","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/250900/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Summary:The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a remake of the original Flash game The Binding of Isaac. It has finally a new engine that runs great, with completely new pixelart graphics - and in case you don't like these, you can set a graphic filter.\n\nIt's a roguelike bullet hell game with controversional black comedy theme. God tells Isaac's mom to kill Isaac, so he runs away from her to basement, where are many scary monsters, from zombies to human centipedes, from unfriendly angels to devils. You might think that the game ends after you kill the Isaac's mom but... you'd be very far from true. You'll accomplish that in few hours of playtime but then you unlock content worth hundreds of hours full of fun!... and I won't spoil to you what awesome funny and hard things The Binding of Isaac brings.\n\n\nPros:- Huge amount of content that offers a lot of playtime for the price of 15 euros. If you fancy the roguelike genre, you'll spend a lot of your time playing The Binding of Isaac Rebirth and you won't regret it.\n- Cute, controversial, black comedy. You have to expect those elements in game design. Cute enemies, true happiness when you get a cancer (great powerup!) or fighting with "brownie" and more similar things.\n- Levels are always different. It was awesome in the original The Binding of Isaac, now we got even more level and room variations. You might find similar room patterns from time to time, but whole levels are always different!\n- Many items. Some are bad, some are good. You have to find yourself and remember what's worth taking through your runs. (And if you don't want it, you can always check The Binding of Isaac wiki, where you can find everything about the game.) Developers had so many great ideas for items, you'll get surprised even as a skilled player what yet unknown have you found.\n- More than 100 achievements. And most achievements unlock new items, bosses and characters!\n- Challenges. And even those, same as achievements, comes with new unlockable items as rewards.\n- Local co-op. This is the colossal innovation that actually many people doesn't know about - Rebirth supports local co-op! Connect the gamepad and your friend can join your game in form of small baby that comes out of your character and steals part of your health to be able to help you.\n- Beautiful pixelart graphic style.\n- Great soundtrack.\n\nCons:- Too much randomness for some people. Runs might be really hard or really easy, depending on your luck on item drops. You might feel bad if you win the game just because you got strong combination of items and not because of your skill.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","January 2","true","196.0"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","25","29","2","1"

It's the game all of us have been waiting for.\n\nThis game is a masterpiece, and it's all I can say.\n\nThe soundtrack is beautiful, it doesn't seem to get old. It is absolutely brilliant. At first, I thought Danny B's soundtrack can never be topped, but this, it just breaks the world, that's how good it is. No offense, Mr. Baranowsky, but this soundtrack is amazing.\n\nBut the game is not all about the soundtrack, but there's a lot more.\n\nComparing this game to the original, it provides a shining new difficulty for me, quite like when I first played the original game. Not only is this game so familiar, it's so distanced from me that it just blows my mind. It gives a perfect feeling of excitement that takes me to the time I first got the original. Simply amazing. The gameplay hasn't changed too much, but there are tons of new things in this game, including items and mobs, as well as all the secrets I find in every corner. This game is the remake of the game I've played 110+ hours for, and it is jam-packed with basically twice as much as the original game has to offer. Everything is confusing, but it's all in the best way possible.\n\nThe reason this game has so much charm is to older players who have a newfound feeling of excitement and curiosity when they play this game. Simply beautiful.\n\nTo the actual game, the story is as is, but there's more to it in this version. That will remain a mystery until the first person reaches that level! The cutscenes are fantastic.\n\nThe gameplay, as said before, is, in my opinion, more difficult than original Isaac. It's unbelievably smooth, which is unlike the original. When you're at the final boss, it's actually pressurizing, even if you have an overpowered combination. It continues to irk me the fact that this game can remain so difficult even after I had Brimstone+Polyphemus, which, for newcomers, is a powerful combination.\n\nThe graphics are more pixelated, with thinner outlines. This was an unbelievable surprise. I thought I would dislike the graphics, but I can easily get used to this.\n\nThe game's engine is one of the hype-raising things. When Ed teased dynamic lasers and brimstone, everyone had already had their life savings on this game, ready to grab it ASAP. None were disappointed.\n\nThe final verdict I would like to give this game is a full 10/10. It's absolutely perfect. It truly is. The replay factor is turned up to the maximum, the gameplay is beautiful, and it is an overall beautiful game.","November 5, 2014","true","114.4"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

The gameplay is magnificent, and thegame runs at a smooth 60 fps with no dips. The items are fun, and add a nice randomization that really adds to the replay value. The game's art style enhances the game's dark unsettleing atmoshpere. The game is chocked full of quirky refrences to many movies and video games that many will enjoy. The game has a decent soundtrack that sadly, doesn't even compare to the original, but this doesn't prevent the soundtrack from adding to the atmosphere. The difficulty of the game is well done, but sometimes relys on luck, but the game includes a seed system that allows players the remove some of the luck factor. The replay value of the game is phenomenal with seemingly endless amounts of runs all with unique characteristics. Overall I would give this game a 8.5-9/10\n\ntl;dr\nPros\n+Great gameplay\n+Awesome atmoshpere\n+Endless replayability\n\nCons\n-Soundtrack isn't too good\n-Occasional luck based difficulty","November 14, 2014","true","240.1"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

It added so many improvements from the original Binding of Isaac, like more enemies, bosses, rooms, items, characters, and a more stable fps! (Even crappy computers can play Rebirth at 60 fps)\n\nThe story of Rebirth is pretty much the same from the original.  You play as a naked baby trying to get revenge on your mom because she tried to kill you since she's a devoted Christian and heard from a higher power that her son (you) is a sin upon this world.  It's pretty much the story of Binding of Isaac from the bible.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to the original Legend of Zelda game for the NES back in 1986.  It’s a top-down dungeon crawler where most of your power (or lack of) comes from items you randomly find throughout the game.  Most enemies and bosses are pretty unique, each of them you’ll need a different strategy to defeat them.  There are 300+ items in this game, which makes for some pretty sweet synergies (you can shoot very large and powerful tears, have lasers come out of your eyes, have explosive vomit, etc.)  And every playthrough will be unique and mysterious, as the game will generate a random seed (which you can share) for each run you play.\n\nThe soundtrack for Rebirth is (for me) ok.  Most of these tracks I wouldn’t listen to outside of the game  (Of course this isn’t the defining feature of Rebirth).\n\nThe unlockables….there are so many things to unlock in this game which you unlock by beating levels with certain characters, find a certain item synergy, beat a certain boss, etc.  Some of the items can be either very easy to unlock or just plain hard.  You can expect to take over 100 hours to unlock all the achievements!\n\nAll in all this game is an amazing game to play!  It was definitely my best game purchase of 2014 and possibly my best purchase ever!  With all the achievements, items, amount of bosses/enemies, very unique rooms, and an endless amount of item synergies, you can expect to pour a ton of hours into this game.  Even with real Platinum God each run I play through is just as fun as my very first run.\n\ntl;dr: Just buy this game, you won’t regret it.\n","April 10, 2015","true","158.7"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","16","16","0","0"

Same plot , but just a lot of other things added.  A lot  of new things. New bosses, endings, items, characters, visuals, enemies, rooms, floors, synergies, mechanics and more. This is  exactly  what a remake should look like.\n\nThe plot of the game is a bit complicated but really messed up. Isaac is a small child who keeps to himself, his mother goes mad thinking that God is telling her to kill Isaac. She ends up throwing him into a basement filled with monsters where he has to use his tears to defeat nasty monsters and bosses. The entire story is filled with references from the Bible, this part is based on the story “Akedah” from the Hebrew Bible in which God asks Abraham to sacrifice his son, Isaac.\n\nThe game does have a  serious  learning curve to it. The first 20-30 hours of the game you’ll spend dying a lot and not knowing enemy patterns and taking bad items. To some people 20-30 hours seems like a ton of time to spend in an indie game just to get past it’s “learning curve” but the more you play it, the better you are at it.\n\nIn the game there are a total of 6 chapters, each chapter has 2 floors in it. Each floor is randomly generated. You have some things that are always there like a shop, an item room, 2 secret rooms and a boss fight but there are also rooms that only have a chance to spawn like curse rooms, sacrifice rooms dice rooms and others. Sometimes in a chapter, 2 floors will be connected, creating what is known as an XL floor which have 2 items room, 2 secret rooms, 1 shop and 2 boss fights.\n\nThe game now also has a brand new beautiful pixel art-style that looks way better than the old game. With the same menu that looks like a small kid drew it, the game looks better than ever. Now everything has smooth animations, everything is so sharp and blends in. Running at 60 FPS on pretty much anything, this game is even good to take with you on your weak laptop and play on the go.\n\nThere are so many mechanics and floors variables and rooms that if I were to explain them all this review would take 5 hours to read. So I’m just going to summarize it. A lot of rooms in TBOIR can be used to gain great items or to completely change a run. Everything is a dice roll and the more you play the easier it is to find your play-style and figure out which risks you like to take in order to beat the game. Some you can use for statistical advantages and others for consumable gain.\n\nAll of this can be extremely overwhelming to people who have just started playing the game, and while yes it is true that the game has a crazy amount of things in it for you to discover and or learn about, you can always follow tutorials online or browse the wiki. The deeper you go, the more complicated to mechanics get and eventually you’ll be doing some really weird stuff to fight certain bosses or unlock certain items.\n\nThe way to unlock everything in the game is pretty simple, beat every end-game boss with every character on hard difficulty. Each character has their own checklist of bosses you have or haven’t yet defeated using that specific character. Everytime you defeat one of those bosses with each character for the first time, you can unlock an item or a trinket or even new floors depending on where you are in the game. .\n\nThere are also a total of 20 challenges that you can do to unlock even more items, cards, trinkets and runes. Some challenges are really easy and some you’ll be screaming at the screen saying that they’re impossible. They are in no sorted order of difficulty so good luck.\n\nThere are also synergies within the game where if you get a combination of items they can be really strong or really messed up but in a fun way. Some synergies are take 2 good items mash them together and become extremely powerful. Some synergies are weird where you get 2 items that are considered bad but when they join forces they are actually really good. There are lots of items that make synergies cooler and some items just build a base for you to build synergies onto.\n\nThe main problem I see a lot of people have with Isaac is that it’s mostly based on randomly generated numbers (RNG). Some runs you just get an incredibly overpowered item in your first item room that carries you throughout the game and some runs are just destined to fail. I personally think that that’s the charm of Isaac. It’s that it’s all different and you always find yourself in new situations.  You have to work with what the game gives you and maybe try new mechanics that you haven’t thought of using before to survive.\n\nThere are also other mechanics like deals with the devil / angel. On the 2nd floor depending on the fact that you didn’t take red heart damage on that floor. You will receive a deal with the devil. If you pay with health for an item in the deal, you will be locked to deals with the devil for the rest of the run as they show up sometimes after you defeat a boss usually having items in them. If you don’t take the first deal on the 2nd floor, then you have a chance to get angel rooms which are known for not being as good but required for certain parts of the game to unlock certain things.\n\nTransformations are also a not huge but good part of the game, you can ‘transform” into certain things by picking up an amount of specific items from a pool of more items. For example if you want to turn into “Lord of the Flies” then you’d have to pick up 3 fly related items. There aren’t a lot of transformations in the game but Afterbirth did add a few new cool ones.\n\nNow, Afterbirth.\n\nAfterbirth came along on Halloween of 2015 adding on a ton of extra stuff to the game including new bosses, items, rooms, endings, final bosses, synergies, challenges, a new game mode and probably more stuff that I can’t remember at the moment. A lot of stuff.\nSame thing happened for the original Binding of Isaac, it got the “Wrath of the Lamb” DLC a while after it came out.\n\nThere are also the dailies which are runs that you can play and they change every 24 hours. Everyone in the world gets the same run with the same end goal using the same seed (A seed is a code you can enter before starting a run so you can play a run someone else has already played). Your score will be posted on the leaderboards and you will be ranked depending on how much damage you took, how many rooms you’ve explored and such.\n\nThese DLCs are great, they’re pretty cheap, they keep the game fresh and they add more stuff for people have 100%-ted the game like me. They improve the overall lifespan of the game and I cannot wait for Afterbirth+ to come out this year.\n\nTL;DR\n\nTBOIR is a masterpiece of a remake, with new sharp pixel graphics, a great community and a huge amount of new content. It was the game the Game Of The Year for me in 2014 and I haven’t stopped playing it since. With new expansions coming out, there is always more stuff to do. This game is a must play and what I would describe as basically a perfect indie game.\n\n10/10!\nFor more reviews like this, check out my curator page  here!","January 27","true","363.5"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","18","20","2","1"

The original is still pretty great.\n\nHowever, comparing the original and the remastered Binding of Isaac is like the difference between a regular membrane keyboard and a mechanical keyboard. You won't notice the difference immediately, but it will stick in your mind if you go back to the original.\n\nRebirth plays much better in comparison via subtle changes to the formula. The main differences between the original and the remastered edition include 160+ new items, native gamepad support (thank Christ), a new set of gameplay and difficulty tweaks (Hard mode being a big tweak for cool kids who like to unlock more things on top of their already unlocked things), and the game engine running at 60FPS all times every times (except when you alt-tab to something else, I've noticed, but I'm not going to hit the developers for that).\n\nIt's a worthy addition to a classic, and I don't know if I can go back to playing the original now, since this supercedes it by a mile. Honestly, the only people I imagine who would complain about this are frustrated teenagers who don't get allowances and those awful pedantic ♥♥♥♥s on Steam who use the forums to complain about refunds every time the pre-orders don't get released on time.","January 23, 2015","true","89.1"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","20","26","2","0"

A tuned up version of Isaac with more stuffed added.  It is everything we wanted and more.  Items synergize better, some enemies and bosses have been tweaked a little, and some items have been fiddled with a little as well, but everything for the most part is as you remember, only in better form.\n\nMy only real gripe is the music isn't nearly as good as it was in the original.\n\nIf this is your first foray into Isaac, don't worry.  You don't need the original.  The game is something of a dungeon crawler with Biblical and crude (and I say that lovingly) themes.  It is challenging, and every run will be different.  Endless amounts of replayability.\n\nIf you're easily offended, the game may not be for you!  If you like a good challenge, like a good laugh, and enjoy a little bit of just plain weird, you can never go wrong with Isaac.","November 8, 2014","true","628.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","1"

In my short time of playing, I have already met two new bosses with somewhat boring abilities, but it expanded on the boss list, increasing replay value.\nIt seems like the dev team expanded quite a lot on spiders and living poops, so expect that.\nApart from mobs, there are now new fire places and a new type of heart.\n\nHUD & GRAPHICS -\nGraphics have significantly changed in this game. Everything seems to be more pixelated and colours less brigher than they were, however it stills feels more lively with a greater colour variation on walls. To me, this works way more in a rogue type game like this one.\nThe map setting have changed as now you can easily minimize and maximise it to your preferances.\n\nROOMS -\nAs you may have already knew, the rooms have been redesigned to sometimes generate as massive rooms. To my surprise, this handles quite nicely as you manouver across it.\n\nOverall,\nI would recommend this game to everybody - both players of the previous game and to those who didn't play Binding of Isaac at all.\n\n+\nMore items and game variation\nExpansion on mobs\nGraphics (personal opinion, some may not like it)\nEven greater replayabilty value\n-\nStoryline still the same\nLack of soundtrack improvements\nNew bosses are not so exciting","November 7, 2014","true","13.3"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

A remake/demake of the original Binding of Isaac (and Wrath of the Lamb) flash game, this really hits perfectly. The tuning changes make every item feel like its useful, rather than running into ones that are quite obviously mis-labeled and detrimental to have. The music gets into your bones and helps to set the atmosphere. The power up combinations and synergies will make you giggle and squirm in your seat when you see two fit perfectly together to make something absolutely indescribable. There's bad things, sure, but most of those come from being used to (or complacent with) the previous version of the game.\n\nOnce the 'well this is different' feeling at finding an item that previously did one thing but now does another wears off, it's smooth sailing into a wonderful waste of hours and days and weeks and...

The idea of a randomized, Zelda-like dungeoncrawler with such a large selection of items is and was a great idea for a game; and I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner. Rebirth does no different. Rebirth, in fact, does better. Last I read there were over 300 items in this installment, and it shows. The game is a tug-of-war between luck and skill and there is always discussion to be had over whether or not you want to grab a book of shadow or a bottle of pills. It is pretty much a direct upgrade to the original, but this is permissable because the content is giant and there are new dungeons and bosses to be fought. I've always been a fan of the biblical imagery and candid symbolism. Worth the money, great game for those who like to clock in and chip away at some benchmarks. My only complaint?

You already know what this game is. This has been on the top 10 list of most-played Steam games since it came out. Chances are you've already played it for at least 20 hours, watched Youtubers play it, or both. Actually, what are you even doing here? Are you looking at reviews for games you've already played, and already have a strong opinion about, just for a sense of validation? Shame. Shame on you. You're grounded. Go back to the basement.\n\nBut for the record, I think this game is absolutely fantastic. Improves on the previous game in pratically every way. It's so great to play Isaac without the Flash lag, and all the new items and secrets are wonderful to discover.  If the original Isaac and Wrath of the Lamb were a 9.0, this is a 9.8.\n\nWhy not 10? Well, personally, I feel it loses some teeny tiny points for some very minor things:\n\n- The new music. Disagree if you want -- and that's fine, I know a lot of people adore the new music -- but personally, I feel it's just not as good as Danny B's soundtrack. Isaac is a very repetitive game -- It's a game where you fight the same enemies in the same environments dozens of times -- and I feel repetitive games deserve catchy soundtracks. Rebirth's music is not catchy and not memorable, but it's moody, creepy, atmospheric, and sometimes downright innovative, but very much resembles the soundtrack to a horror movie rather than the pulse-pounding action game that this is. It does have much higher production values than the original, and the extra music layer that kicks in during tough rooms is a great touch, but as much as it’s grown on me, I still find myself missing the old soundtrack too much. In fact, I’d probably throw money at a DLC that adds the old music back in some form.\n\n- The sprite graphics. All the sprites in this game are not pixel art -- they're actually still the same old flash vectors, but now they have aliased pixels traced over them, making them look low-res. Just... Why?? Why fix what's not broken? Well, I kind of know the answer. It was Ed McMillen's original vision for the game to have pixel graphics, and he eventually came to loathe even looking at the original graphics because he felt they were rushed. I can respect that. But the original graphics had CHARM, dammit. The enemies were deceptively cute, and it was awesome. I loved looking at them. And besides, I always felt that the Binding of Isaac was the ultimate pinnacle of the gross, gory, shocking, irreverent wave of Flash animations that flooded Newgrounds and the internet in the 00's, and Isaac's vector art fit that role so perfectly. Yeah, I know there's a filter you can turn on, but it makes the graphics even worse. At any rate, the particles, backgrounds, effects, and stunning cutscenes more than make up for it in the graphics department, so I don't complain too loudly.\n\n- The game is very, very, very easy. Though I can't tell how much of that is just my skill after having Platinum God'd the original game. But with all the great new items, it seems that Rebirth is less about skill and more about consistently becoming overpowered, and it gives you ample opportunities to do so. I feel like I can always tell if a run is won or lost by the end of the very first level, whereas in the original Isaac I had to stick around for a while before I could tell if a run had potential, because there weren't enough game breakers that you were likely to find one in the first item room and then a good devil deal to synergize with it. But again, I don't complain loudly because repeatedly becoming a god -- especially a different kind of god each time -- is a blast, so maybe this was the direction the game should have taken in the end.\n\nAfter a few arguable nitpicks, this is still nearly a 10/10 game in my book. But there’s no need to listen to me! Isaac is so ubiquitous now that you either already own it, or know whether or not you want it. Again, why are you even reading reviews? Back to the basement with you!","November 9, 2014","true","309.5"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","21","31","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kelgis/recommended/250900/","Kelgis","Kelgis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kelgis/","185 products in account","Rebirth is, technically, just an expansion and redesigning to the original Binding of Isaac. However, with so much new content (nearly twice as many items, at 343, the original having 196 - Lots of new bosses, one new level, four new dynamic characters) and so many incredible synergies between items, not to say the different pixelly aesthetic, it ends up feeling like an entirely new experience. A lot of familiar sights, yet experiencing it in Rebirth feels far different from the original.\n\nThe addition of the Eden character adds an interesting challenge, of getting random stats and items. You can get really horrible results, or really good ones, but every run with Eden ends up being a worthwhile, different experience. Or hellish challenge. It's a tad annoying that it takes tokens for every run with Eden, but as long as you're not a reset maniac, you don't really run out.\n\nAzazel is a very interesting character, as he starts with flight and a short ranged Brimstone. If RNG isn't being nice to you, a run with Azazel tends to be a good choice, as once you get better at the game, you're essentially guaranteed success if you select Azazel. It's a very fun character due to these things, as you don't have to worry about bad items and stats and just get to kick some ♥♥♥.\n\nThe Lost is stupid, but I guess at least he has flight. It's a worthwhile challenge, but it ends up being more about being lucky than being skilled. A lot of room setups, even with flight, are just absolutely insane to handle if your offensive potential isn't high, especially some like Mask & Heart filled rooms in Necropolis or 2x The Adversary rooms in The Chest/Dark Room. A very skilled player would survive with a lot of effort and precise movement, yes, but in the end you're just running about hoping the erratic movement of certain monsters doesn't completely screw you over.\n\nThe Dark Room level isn't much different from The Chest in itself, having a very similar selection of bosses for every room. The main difference is just in the final boss. It'd have been nice to get some more new levels, however with the addition of so many new bosses, Mega Satan and with upcoming DLC (which, considering the old DLC for the original, Wrath of the Lamb, will probably contain a load of new content aswell), this isn't something that actually bothered me much in my playtime. With so much variety in every aspect of the game, it never felt truly repetitive in all of my playtime.\n\nChallenges were very interesting, especially ones where you'd be blindfolded and have to resort to specific mechanics to survive such as Solar System and Cat Got Your Tongue. Annoying as hell at times, as the game and its enemies/bosses were definitely not designed for combat with nothing but Guppy's Hairball or attack flies, but a different and fun way to play the game. The Cursed challenge also introduced a really fun aspect, making you really think about your movement and actions. Sadly, there were not all that many challenges that really forced you to play differently.\n\nOne of my main issues ended up just being quick resetting until I got some decent items, especially when playing with The Lost. Granted, The Lost in itself is supposed to be a very difficult challenge for expert players, but I can't say I had a lot of fun, nor that it was particularly challenging, resetting constantly in Hard Mode (which also decreases the chance of treasure rooms spawning nearby the start) until I got something at least decent to begin with.\n\nBut overall, Rebirth was a great game and very much worth picking up, even if you already played the original. Hell, having played the original only made my experience better. It has enough content to last you a long while, and if you go for 100% completion (or 111%), be ready to waste away a few weeks at it. Now let's wait and see if the DLC will be as incredible as Wrath of the Lamb was to the original.","January 22, 2015","true","398.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

It's way more open to interpretation, but that's the initial presentation of the plot.\n\nThe game is played from a top-down perspective, with pixelated, though impressively detailed and fluid sprites and models. It keeps a consistent, if mildly unsettling tone.\n\nThe sound effects are distinct and satisfying - from the growls and shrieks of enemies, to the subtle differences between picking up a penny, a nickel or a dime. Every level sequence has a musical theme attached to it, which gains a few more background instruments when there's a lot of enemies. Boss battle music is great.\n\nThis is a roguelite, so expect two things: permadeath (unless you have items which grant extra lives, your run ends when you're completely out of health) and random generation (levels are composed of random rooms, room sizes, designs, enemies, items and so on). The sheer unpredictability of any run is a contributing factor to its longevity, alongside the ridiculous item collection: who knows if, on this run, you'll get, say, Brimstone? And what crazy combo can you discover or make use of with it? And even if you don't find what you're looking for, the game expects you to push forward, weighing together chance, risk and opportunity.\n\nAlso cancer is good to have.\n\nSo, you should get this, yeah.","May 11","true","58.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","4"

The basics of gameplay have remained relatively unchanged from the original (so I’ll explain more the differences; read my review on the original for gameplay) but have been expanded in multiple ways.\n\n* Differences between the original and Rebirth\n\nAs mentioned, the basic gameplay remained the same: Isaac progresses through floors defeating enemies, collecting consumables and finding various ways to break the game. The most important change, however, has been the remake of the game remake to a custom one instead of outdated Flash, making performance much better even on older machines. In relation to that, many items and mechanics which couldn’t work due to Flash limitations have been expanded and corrected with synergies (such as one of my favourites, Tammy’s Head + Brimstone). Compared to the original, where floors seemed like a bunch of boxes smashed together, the floors in Rebirth are much more fluid, seem natural and you can always find a new room shape (to my surprise!). Money has been given a broader purpose by introducing a few new items that synergize well, but I think most of the Donation Machine, which makes the Shop much more useful and reliable, while also unlocking a few cool new items and may give a boost to your Luck stat. Although I would not recommend donating over 999 coins, as I can attest to. Seriously, don’t. A few new characters have been introduced (my favourite being the ever changing Eden) and over 150 new items (my favourites, the 12 Zodiac items). Although I haven’t had the experience due to a lack of a second player, you can have a friend assisting you as a randomly spawned familiar, which can have positive or negative traits. Finally, challenges have been expanded to a total of 20, difficulty ranging from Azazel easy to highly infuriating.\n\n* Afterbirth\n\nA recently released expansion for Rebirth, Afterbirth provides a completely new game mode, called Greed mode, which happens to be quite fun, although you’ll need a lot of time to complete it as every character. It also introduced alternate floors, each with unique soundtrack, new enemies that will enrage you, a bunch of new items that are mostly fine by me, although some are weak. There is also a new character, that is quite different from the others by being blindfolded and making the run much different (but not too much) in the items you’ll find desirable. There is also 10 new challenges, many of which are much more difficult than the previous 20, and will occupy your time.\n\n*Closing comments\n\nWith a ton of new content, an excellent soundtrack and a wonderful expansion, Rebirth is a must have for anyone who enjoyed the original, although as always I’d recommend waiting for a sale as the price can be a little high, compared to similar indie games, but more than worth it.","January 15","true","187.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Especially when you improve tactically, every enemy has their own movement patterns and firing patterns, when these become natural to you the game will become easier.\n\nWhen I say that the game is hard that does not mean it is not fair, any discomfort you feel while playing is solely on the player. If you get dealt a bad hand by the RNG, it is still satisfying to overcome this disadvantage.\n\nOne great advantage of this version of the game is the art style, it being in a pixel format means that it is timeless since these types of game age a lot more gracefully.\n\nI highly recommend you buy it.","February 18, 2015","true","432.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It's been a few months and it's time for a review, so let's find out.\nIn short:\n\nGOOD\n+ Have you never played Isaac before? No worries, this game is perfect on it's own and needs no previous experience to play.\n+ Improved graphics and optimalisation make for one hell of a smooth game. I only experienced frame-rate loss ONCE at that was when some pretty crazy stuff was going on.\n+ Tons of new stuff to experiment with, even with the classic items as many of them have been changed slightly.\n+ The original Isaac feelings of exploring every floor for every tiny factor that could improve your run is still neatly intact.\n+ It's hard but not unforgiving or cheap. If you made a mistake it feels like your own instead of a faulty game. Makes you want to get better at it and push on. (Aside from you, Brimstone Wall-spiders. You can all go ♥♥♥♥ yourselves :P)\n+ I love bosses so they deserve their own mention. And the upcoming DLC promises even more of them, neat!\n+ New endings and plot elements for those who are interested in Isaac's vague (but interesting) storyline.\n\nNOT SO GOOD\n- Fans of the original's music might be in for a disappointment as the score is not even close to as epic as the original. Many of the intense songs have been replaced. Example; the Cathedral no longer has a dooming score but now has some dude using the echo-effect on his micophone trying to sound spooky, which is a REAL downer on the atmosphere sometimes. These arguments shouldn't be dismissed as fanboys being fanboys, as the original had a lot of success due to it's atmosphere, which was very well enforced by the music. In this remake? Not so much, could use improvement imo.\n- If you thought the original had too many bad items you couldn't work with, expect a bit more of it here. Since there are more then 300 items in the game it get's completely random wether your run is overpowered or complete garbage from begginning to end.\n- In tow with the last complaint, this game feels even more luck-based then the last one. In classic Isaac I could save a run with bad items using pure gaming skill but now with all the new bosses and enemies? Not so much. You NEED decent upgrades if you want to get through the later chapters. Or maybe I just suck with Rebirth compared to the original, but I kinda doubt that.\n\nSo if you're a fan of the original you''ll probably like this one. It's another achievement-fest for all of us with OCD and it's a bunch of fun completing everything over a long(er) period of time. If you were a real fan of the original artstyle and music and you think those changes turn you off too much then I won't blame you, as it is a pretty big factor of  the game. But let me just tell you I started to love it just as much when I got used to it, so it's really worth a try!\n\n(apart from the Cathedral music, YUCK!)","February 25, 2015","true","165.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

The controls are extremely tight, and there are very few occasions where it feels like you are not in control of how your run goes. It's also marked by a near-infinite level of replayability, as the game is tough as nails if you can't break the initial barrier but becomes extremely satisfying and enjoyable if you manage to surpass it with a combination of your skill and game dynamics.\n\nThe main thing about Isaac that really stands out is that it takes the concept of breaking a game and builds an entire system of meta-gameplay around this, with secret bosses that practically require you to break your run in fun and empowering ways and unlocks that require hundreds of instances of experimentation and recombination of gameplay elements. The game has hundreds of hours of unlocks that really test your mettle and determination, and maybe thousands of hours more of pure unadulterated fun in replayability.\n\nPresentation 8/10\nStylish and fluid, the graphics are pretty stunning and not oversold by-the-numbers pixel-ification. There are subtle homages to pretty much the entire history of videogames, but despite being obvious to seasoned players they are presented in a very original and uncompromising way. The soundtrack and soud design is phenomenal and while not perfect really suits the game world and tone just as well as the visual feel.\n\nAccessibility 6/10\nThis, I think, is Isaac's greatest downfall, and i strongly believe it comes from the format of the game. Its random nature extends the gameplay in a way that means you will often have polarisingly difficult runs, from times when you can immediately tell you will win without much hassle to endless streaks of runs where you will be made to feel like a helpless fish out of water. It is the only element of the game that feels out of the player's control, especially when you're first starting out and don't completely know the ropes. I cannot say for sure what could remedy this, because it is sure to deter some players from continuing the experience, but it is certainly not such a sordid detail that it ruins the entire gameplay experience.\n\nOverall 8/10\nI cannot emphasise this enough: It is FUN. It can be a ♥♥♥♥♥ sometimes, but if you can allow yourself not to take the experience too seriously you are guaranteed to become totally submerged in all of its quirks and subtleties that create the immensely replayable experience of Isaac.","April 19","true","540.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

This version manages to add some of these improvements and well, such as controller support, an improved interface and challenge modes. The game is generated randomly with different items and bosses each time whilst having various rooms, traps and creatures along the way. It is a very dark setting as you play an unloved child with various incarnations of other children and their mutations to fight against with tears from your eyes (I kid you not). It is one of the better rogue games I have played and the setting is unique. My main criticism would be that I feel I have almost been forced to buy a Alpha and final version of the same game.

I believe I have ~24 hours in that game.\nWhen Wrath of the Lamb came out, it made it all the better, new items, challenges, etc.  It was nothing short of a wonderful experience hard to find elsewhere.\n\nRebirth, on the otherhand, is a masterpiece.\nTo begin with, the new graphic style that has been added in is beautiful!  I love the slightly pixelated style that comes along with it.  If you don't, and prefer the old style, no problem: there is an option to revert back to that.\nRebirth adds countless new rooms to explore, making each run truely feel new and fresh, where the previous would feel quite similar after just a few.\nThere are a rediculous amount of items in Rebirth, both new and old.  Although the majority of the items ARE from the previous, the combos you can pull off now are completely new, and make the items have a new refreshing feel to them.  Nearly every item can combo in some way or another with others, creating some incredibly (OP) hilarious effects.\nIf you happen to be looking for new bosses, they've got that too, as well as the old and memerable ones from before. (I am talking about you Monstro you cute little abomination!)\n\nAlright, I think that about concludes that.  I don't believe I have missed anything too terribly.\nReally, if you enjoyed the previous game, get this.  Don't even hesitate.  It's an amazing upgrade, and with planned future DLC, I am sure it is going to get even better.\nIf you haven't played the previous, all I can say, is if you enjoy roguelike games, then you are looking at one of the BEST ones you can find out there.\n\nTLDR: First game that motivated me to aim for completing ALL the achievements.  Get this game if you like roguelike games, as it is a masterpiece.\n","March 6, 2015","true","359.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

I'll review this endearing gem below in pro/con format.\n\nPROS:\n*The game contains inspirational messages and sometimes my character strobes in rainbow colors.. Its filled with colorful hearts and mushrooms and treasure!\n*During the main storyline its possible to bless your bald character with a head of thick, curly, musty hair(s).\n*Most of the basement's citizens greet you with a big, toothy smile.

Seems like the contractor focused on devious difficulty and traps instead of color, space, and theme.. Not a decorative pillow in the whole place..\n*I keep ending up getting pooped on, and getting my weiner exposed, which makes the game quite emotional at times..\n*The end-game fight against Raptor Jesus is bugged..\n*None of the dungeon residents know how to respect my personal space.\n*I take lots of pills and shots but never get to smoke anything..\n\nOverall, I'd say that this game is based on a true story, and makes a perfect digital gift for any loved one, ages 3 and up.\n\n11/10, would poop/feces/vomit/fetus/blood/bile/mutate again","December 2, 2014","true","214.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

If you thought that the game that it's a remake of was already stellar, this game, for the most part, pushes the boundaries even further.\n\nWell, only in some categories. In others (like graphics), I felt the new-style pixel graphics were disappointing compared to the original. Now I know Edmund himself said he was disappointed with the old graphics since Isaac looks deformed, but I feel the slightly lopsided Isaac gives a certain charm and home-made (homely? I don't quite know how to properly describe it!) feel to it. Other than that, everything looks a lot more polished. And for what it's worth, almost all the enemies look nearly identical to their old versions!\n\nThe new music - well, it does fit the creepy ambience that the game now projects. Technically, it was always a rather creepy ambience, but the new graphics and the new music makes it feel even more so. I'm not saying the music is bad - quite the contrary, it's quite groovy to listen to actually. However, having been brought up on the first Binding of Isaac, I still miss Danny Baranowsky's work and give it a spin sometimes.\n\nWith that said, everything else is impressive. There's a larger variety of items and effects - some being hilariously detrimental (new pill effect R U A WIZARD which gives you 45 degree spread shots) and some being incredibly awesome (new item Leech that attacks enemies and leeches their health - awesome!). New hard mode, new characters, new monsters, even seeded runs (well, I kind of know how it works now). It even runs at 60FPS so it feels a lot smoother than the original Isaac - no more lag due to Flash. This opens up a new realm of crazy synergies that are overpowered. (And, of course, low-powered combinations that no one gives a damn about because they are terribly weak. Haha!)\n\nThere are also quite a few interesting secrets to find in this game. One such secret is a special character that can only be unlocked by dying in different manners in a row (I won't spoil it here, go Google or something). Although Edmund and Tyrone (Rodriguez, from Nicalis) aren't quite happy that this secret was discovered quite fast due to data mining, it's quite obvious that there's a lot of love and care put into this game to implement some of the craziest secrets that can be found here.\n\nBut, most important of all, underneath all the new flashy exterior is the game we still know and love - our favourite dungeon-crawling RPG-shooting roguelike. Conceivably better in nearly every aspect, it feels refreshing to play Isaac all over again, after having put it down after beating the first one. At the same time, it meant I felt incredibly rusty after having being off Isaac for so long!\n\nWhen to buy: Well worth the $15 price tag slapped onto it. Don't hesitate to pick it up! Of course, you'll also get more bang for your buck if you get it while it's on sale, but come on, just buy it at maximum price and support the developers!\n\nNOTE: Afterbirth DLC has been released. Definitely a must-buy too. :)\n\n10/10 (Wow, a perfect score totally uninfluenced by bonus points! It's just that good.)","November 4, 2014","true","431.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

The games story is about a crying naked child, named Isaac, who have ventured down to the depths of his basement full of monsters escaping from his corrupted mom who had been told by god to end his life.\n\nCharming, am i right?\n\nThe Binding of Isaac, with its addictive dungeon crawler, top down shooter, rouge like gameplay, dark tone and charming story went on to catch many gamers eyes, and love. Including mine. The game sold over 1 million copies, and is highly regarded as one of the best gems of the Indie industry.\n\nNow, that ive told you how much loved the original binding of issac was, is it really worth paying three times the price of the original game for a remake?\nThe answer is: Yes. Its worth every single penny.\nThe game has benn rebuilt from scrath, whit an all new engine. Which brings new beautiful lightning effects and gorgeous 16-bit graphics, that makes the game runnable at 60fps on almost any computer. And not to mention all the new content that has been added to the game, but thats up to you to discover.\n\nThe gameplay remains just as addicting as the first Binding of Isaac's. The game is a joy to play, from the second you boot up the game, to the second you die.\nThats when you hate the game.\nRemember what i said about The Binding of Isaac being a rouge like game? Well, if your new to the genre, a rouge like game is a game where you only have one chance to beat the game, and if you die you will have to start all over again.\n\nFor many, this is the reason why they run from The Binding of Isaac.\n\nBut for others, this is the main reason you buy the game. And all the different item drops, and combinations makes for almost endless replayabilty. This is one of the strongest points of The Binding of Isaac Rebirth, and it will take you weeks, and months to discover everything this game has to offer you. The Binding of Isaac Rebirth will keep you up late at night.\n\nBut This is also where the main issue of the game comes in. You see, everything in the game, from the level structure to the item drops are all decided in RNG. Aka, Randomly Generated Numbers. The game is all built around luck. The game can feel straight off frustrating time to time, and many times you will feel like the reason you died was all based on the items you got, not on your skill.\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nBut in the end, it dosent matter how good your items are, if your dodge is completely off and you cant hit your tears, you will die. Over. And over. Again.\n\nAnd oh, remember what i said about Rebirth keeping you up at night? Well, i didnt really tell the whole truth. This game is made by sick persons, for sick persons. The game is deeply disturbing and contains so much gore and blood, that even i had to look away times to times. This game is not for everyone.\n\nAnd the RNG that may feel so frustrating at times, is the heart and the soul of The Binding of Isaac Rebirth. And so much of the games charm, replayability and joy would be taken away without it. Not knowing whats around the next corner, or in the next item room is exiting, and essential for the game.\n\nBecause in the end, what The Binding of Isaac Rebirth does so right is its amazing, addicting gameplay, charming art-style and endless replayability.\n\nAnd if neither the disturbing visuals, the RNG or the rouge like gameplay scares you away from this title, there isnt much on Steam that can offer this amount of content, and pure joy for 15 euros.\n\n9/10","February 26, 2015","true","13.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

Even in its infancy, Rebirth has succeeded in amazing me. Although the core gameplay is the same, the new art, items, and engine make for a refreshing, addicting experience. One I think I will keep coming back to for years to come. The randomization creates endless combinations of items, some of which synergize quite nicely. Overall, I reccomend this to fans of the first, and curious newcomers.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ernestmurdertrain/recommended/250900/","ernestmurdertrain","Ernest Wolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ernestmurdertrain/","419 products in account","I've played the original Binding of Isaac for over 200 hours and it was an amazing game with a huge replay value. First time I heard about a remake, I thought that it's not gonna be anything special. A couple more soundtracks, maybe a few more items and would have less flaws (original didn't have much flaws, to begin with). I wasn't quite sure why they have to make a remake of the game if it's so great already. Turns out, the game was meant to be a little flash game and there was tons of stuff that wasn't added, due to the limitations of Flash and major bugs. Rebirth is what Edmund McMillen, the developer wanted for it to be. And now more about the game...\n\nRebirth is a remake done correctly. Unlike many other developers that make mediocre remakes of their previous games, Rebirth has been drastically changed. While the story is the same and the game looks similliar to original one, it feels like a new one. You still have the feeling that you are playing the original game, but it also feels like a new game at the same time, which in my opinion is, what a remake should be. If you thought that the original game had tons of content and hours of fun gameplay, Rebirth has got way more. There are a lot more enemies added, more items, new engine, new soundtrack and so much more and the old bosses remain the same. At least, I haven't encountered them having any new abilities. The game also runs smoother and will have at least 60fps on most old PCs. The only flaw in the game was the soundtrack for me. It's really cool, but I liked the previous one better and there is a mod that allows you to use the old one's if you feel the same way.\n\nThe Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a challenging game and I would recommend it to rogue-like game fans, because this game is top-notch. The game is pretty mysterious in my opinion, because the story is odd and the things you see while playing the game is really odd, so I always speculate if there's a deep meaning behind all of this game. So, if you are into these kind of things, you should get the game for sure. It's worth the full price!\n\n","December 16, 2014","true","127.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It has so much variation and randomness, but not too much that it gets annoying and that you rage and uninstall the game. It has varies amounts of items, special abilities, cards and enemies which makes it have high Replay value. Along with the randomly generated dungeons this game is truly is the best Rogue-lite game I have ever played.\n\nGame PlayThis game has so much to talk about so get ready for a fairly long review.  This game has such variety that it's hard to talk about every single detail about this game, so I will break down the Game Play header into other sub categories.\n\nBasic Game Play\nThis game has a simple way to play. You move with WSAD and you can shoot with the arrow keys. This is such a good choice on controls as you can move in one direction and shoot in another. The way that the controls work and respond quickly is really needed when playing a game as difficult as this. The story is pretty basic, but fits really well with the game play and has purpose and reason why you are doing what you are doing. Your mum has a message from god that she must prove herself to him and kill you, Isaac. You over hear this and you run to the corner and quickly slip down into the basement to avoid death. Now you must fight through each floor, avoiding loads of enemies, collecting useful (or maybe not useful) items to help you along the way. This is very fitting for the story and I like it a lot. There is also a huge amount of replay ability because of the randomly generated dungeons that you run through. This means that there are almost an infinite amount of runs that will all be different and will play out differently. This really does pull the played in and want to play 'one' more run. Then it turns into a few more runs until you kill mum. Really grabbing, and really good at wanting you to play more of the game. Something else that the game offers are challenges, and some of these are really hard to complete. I would recommend getting used to the basic game before getting into any of these challenges as some of these are just too difficult to complete.\n\nEnemies, Bosses & Items\nAs I mentioned in the Overview of this review there is a really huge amount of variety of this game. When it comes to enemies, bosses and items then this game really has dedicated it's time and effort to these 3 things. There are several different types of areas that you could be in. Along with themed enemies, and some enemies that I really have no clue what they are, it really sets the tense atmosphere when you are getting near the end of the run. When you are on that last half a heart of life and you are really far in the run you feel really tense. Some of the items that you can collect will do a various amount of things, such as increase your defence, increase your life, gives you a friend, gives you eternal life ect the list just goes on and on for what your character can collect. There are also some chances that you have to take, such as pills that you find. These pills will have a random effect, whether it will increase your attack, decrease your speed, give you bombs again there is a massive amount of things that these pills will do. It just adds more risk:reward. If you are prepared to take the risk of possibly decreasing your attack but might increase your speed then go ahead. I normally just leave these as they only give you a small amount of either good or bad things that only really make the game a little bit different. Then there are things such as cards which you can use and are a bit like pills, but you can see the picture of the card and the name. So if you can memorize what the cards do then you can use them to your advantage. Lastly I will talk about the great variety of bosses that are in this game. At the end of every dungeon you will have to defeat a boos to proceed. This is also a randomly selected boss which makes the game even better and just adds to the high replay value! This game is just so good!\nScore (Out Of 10): 10 - High replay value, brilliant variation and randomly generated dungeons, this is what you want in a Rogue-lite\n\nGraphics/Art StyleThe art style for this game is really nicely down, and really fits well with the atmosphere and the game play in general. I especially like the simplicity of the opening cut scene of the game, the graphics are just simply black and white as the cut scene plays. The main art style of the game is really colourful. I really like the art style because it's not too cartoony that it looks childish, and it's not too serious to make it look patronising. Its just right, and really fits with game play.\nScore (Out Of 10): 10 - really simplistic and fitting graphics, really suits the game well.\n\nMusicThe music for this game is really good, I really like the soft music when you are just normally roaming around the dungeons, and then the drastic change once you enter a boss room. It really makes the battles more intense and on each dungeons floor. Once you kill the boss there is a certain feeling that you feel really accomplished about yourself, but you know that there is still more to go.\nScore (Out Of 10): 10 - really nice use of music to make the boss battles more intense\n\nConclusionI would recommend this game to anyone who likes Rogue-lite, difficult games with very high replay value. There are so many different runs that can happen that you never really get bored of the game. You just want to come back wanting to play another game, and then maybe do a challenge, and then another normal run. It's a endless cycle of fun. Highly recommended to all Rogue-lite and difficult fans!\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Lot's O Giveaway's curator group here.","February 14","true","96.7"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

You must navigate your basement and kill aborted fetuses, babies in general, and occassional abominations using your tears. Most of these abortions were not born yesterday, so you must adapt different tactics and strategies and use every tool at your disposal to beat them. These tools include bombs, universal keys, and loose change. You quite literally need to sift through poop to find pennies, therefore players of Jewish ethical descent may find this game enjoyable. You must eventually find your mother and murder her, alongside Satan, yourself, an undead version of yourself, yourself again, and your undead self once again, amongst others.\n\nChristian fundamentalists or religious extremists may find this game to be offensive. This game is more offensive than that time I locked myself out of my car at an abortion clinic and they gave me a dirty look when I asked them for a coat hanger after making a miscarriage joke. When playing, you have a variety of multitasking at hand regarding combat and conserving resources. You must become as adept at multitasking as Helen Keller is at playing the piano with one hand and singing with the other. This game has many features similar to the classic dungeon crawling Zelda games like its predecessor, but with more content and a theme revolving around a Pro-Life nightmare or on the contrary a Pro-Choice wet dream.\n\nIssac, the protagonist, is also a transexual crossdresser. This allows him to take on a variety of personalities that are in the form of unlockable characters, each with their own special multiple-personality disorder themed unique abilities. Alongside this, the game offers a variety of unlockable content in the form of new items, levels, and more. Multiple endings are available that seem to hide a plot of some sort, which may or may not include issac being molested by the pope after murdering his mother with the special guest appearences of Lucifer, Muhummad, and Richard Dawkins.\n\nIf you're a fan of mildy offensive high quality dungeon crawling roguelikes with alot of replayibility, I would recommend this game. However, in its current state it is plagued with some bugs and compatibility issues, slightly reducing its score.\n\nI give it 9/11 stars, would offend again.","November 4, 2014","true","27.8"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","15","24","0","0"

Hell, this might be one of the most addicitive and fun games I've played in my life. Everything that made the original Binding of Isaac fun is back, but the game has been polished tenfold, there is so much new content, and it's basically better than the original in everyway.\n\nThat said, this game is not for everyone. The content and subject of the game is groutsque and dark, and the gameplay is hardcore rougle-like. I think one of three reactions are possible.\n\n1. You will find the game disturbing and sick and be put off by the content.\n2. You won't mind the content but might find the game a bit too hardcore and think it's kind of frustrating and unrewarding.\n3. You will completely fall in love with it.\n\nI firmly am in the third. The new soundtrack is A+. dark, foreboding and brilliant. And with the new expansion, Afterbirth, the game is brimming with soooooo much replay value, words can't describe.\n\nHIGHLY reccomend that every person should at least give the game a try. It might not appeal to everyone, but for those it does, there are few rouge likes brimming with more content and fun than this masterpiece.\n\n10/10 would kill Satan again.","January 6","true","168.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TimisD/recommended/250900/","TimisD","Grass is for mowing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TimisD/","64 products in account","The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is one of the best games I've played this year. The game is hard, unforgiving, and does NOT hold your hand. But that's the beauty of the game. With amazing level design and fleshed-out upgrades, the game has a huge amount of replayability, because levels are randomly generated each time, with all new upgrades, enemies, and bosses.\nBoI:R runs extremely well, and I've never had it crash on me. Though it does have a very limited options menu, you probably won't need anything changed too much, because the game looks like an old arcade game (which happens to be an amazing finish for the game) and will run on any machine. Also like an arcade game, the combat is very straightforward, but feels great. It's rich in a very satisfying, yet simple way.\nYou can't forget about the music in this game. It's not phenomenal, no, but it is in no way bad. The music seems to always match what's going on, whether you're fighting a boss, or backtracking for health, the music never seems too exaggerated or underwhelming. It's just right. As well as the normal sounds in the game. They are also very nicely done.\nThe game is also strangly funny. Not an overthetop South Park funny, but more like a sort of random funny, like The Simpsons. In no way is the game an episode of The Simpsons, but it reminds me of that. Just randomness and dumb jokes that are pulled of quite well. The intro cutscene, explaining why Isaac is where he is, is honestly halarious. It had be laughing, which isn't something games do too often. And the gameplay has a few jokes in the way things are played out as well.\nCharacters are very good in this game. There's Isaac, the basic character, but then there are also other characters that you can use as a sort of challenge, like a flying bat that can go over any obstacle, but can't actually hurt any enemies until you lose a heart. And speaking of challenges, there is an entire challenge screen for different ways to play the game, all of them being enjoyable.\nTo wrap things up, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is one of the best games I have ever played. It is bigger and better than the original Binding of Isaac, but it's different enough that it feels like a new game, and not just a rehash. With a cheap price, amazing gameplay, phenomenal level design and changes, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a must own, not just for people who like the arcade genre, but for anyone who enjoys great, unforgiving games that will make you smile while simultaneously making you want to smash your keyboard. The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a 10/10, or perfect game, as far as I'm concerned.","December 30, 2014","true","8.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I had a bit of suspision that this game could just be the same game as before, but as I play more and more of it, the Binding of Isaac: Rebirth seems like a whole new game and I am getting that feeling that I first got when I started learning about and playing the regular Binding of Isaac. Of course, replay value will be awesome again. Also, I was worried that I wouldn't like the pixel art after watching numerous videos before this game actually came out. However, after playing the game for 15 minutes, I can say I don't mind the art. To top it all off, this game runs at a BEAUTIFUL 60 FPS; so eye-pleasing. So yeah, good game. I recommend it! :D\n\nUpdate: I can back up this review by saying after going back to the regular Binding of Isaac after playing this version, the old Binding of Isaac is utter crap and looks and runs horribly compared to Rebirth. xD","November 6, 2014","true","362.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","8"

It is hard,punishing,and sometimes comes down to just plain dumb luck. That being said it is a great game the dungeons are all procedurally generated  so you're never doing the same thing twice. on top of this all the loot you find are interesting and can change the way you fight dramatically.The boss fights are also very  fun and a great challenge heck you get to fight a giant pile of ♥♥♥♥ which happened to also be one of the hardest early boss's for me.The art for this game is great its all terribly grotesque and disturbing even some of the loot you get can make whatever character you are playing as look just grotesque and hard to look at. But like I said this is a game that is not for everyone if you don't like rogue-like games and very punishing games then this is not for you but on the other hand if you love these things like me then this game is a must have.On a side note for those who played the first game this not only improves on those features but is arguable better than the first.","November 9, 2014","true","7.9"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","1"

A dungeon crawler rogue-like indie game. It is a truely fun game and brings the original to shame. I will be rating this review in 5 parts: gameplay, replayability, stability (as in bugs and such), graphics, and finally overall score.\n\nGameplay - 10/10\nThis game is a legend of zelda rogue like game with many characters to pick and choose from, including but not limited to Isaac, Judas, and Azazel. As you go along the game, picking up items to make you more powerful, you discover new creatures, rooms, and secrets. It plays well with a keyboard and is controller optimized, but isn't really the kind of game you would want to use one on. I am not taking off points for it, however, for putting the controller optimization in it, and the fact that keyboard controls are simple but easier to use.\n\nReplayability - 10/10\nThe whole game is about unlocking new items, characters, bosses, and floors. No run is ever the same, in terms of who you fight and what items you get. The more you play, the more items and characters you unlock with in turn allows for EVEN MORE things to get. This game rewards you for finding "secrets" and all endings, by giving you items and extending the game, making it harder. This 15 dollar game is definitely going to get you 200+ hours out of it, maybe even closer to 500 or 600.\n\nStability - 10/10\nI have expirenced no bugs over the course of my playing this game. It came out in an extremely stable fashion.\n\nGraphics - 9/10\nThe graphics are 16x type graphics rather than the smoother graphics of the original. This form of graphics was chosen by the fans of the game, and thus is to the liking of most. I am docking one point, however, because the music doesn't necessarily fit the graphics. The music is an orchestral soundtrack, yet the graphics are 16x. They just don't fit well.\n\nOverall score - 9.75/10\nRebirth is an amazing game, because it is a fresh new step for The Binding of Isaac and will bring loads more fun than normal Binding of Isaac + Wrath of the Lamb. This game is balanced a lot more and has added 150+ new items and many, many new enemies and bosses. Get it first chance.","November 6, 2014","true","26.9"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NameNoMatter/recommended/250900/","NameNoMatter","NameNoMatter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NameNoMatter/","109 products in account","The Binding of Isaac Rebirth. This game was hyped by almost an endless amount of people. For good reason too! The original game, made by Edmund McMillen, at the time famous for Super Meat Boy (a game that only I appear to dislike), is a dungeon crawler based on the biblical story of the same name. In the biblical story, Isaac is the son of Abraham, and God requires a sacrifice to prove Abraham's loyalty. As Abraham is about to sacrifice his son, God sends an angel to stop him. So, the story of Binding of Isaac is that Isaac is a small boy who lives with his mother. His mother likes to watch Christian television, while Isaac draws pictures, and plays with toys. One day his mother hears the voice of God, saying that Isaac is corrupted by evil. She takes all his toys and stuff away from him. Again, she hears God. He says that he is still corrupted, and that he must be condemned from the Earth. She locks him in his room and he's not allowed to come out. For the final time God contacts his mother and demands she kills Isaac. She gets a kitchen knife, and goes to kill Isaac, but Isaac escapes through a trapdoor under his rug, which leads to the basement. That is where the game starts.\nNow that that is out of the way, I'm going to go through pros and cons. This is my second time reviewing this, so if you saw the first one, I have changed it.\n\nPros:\n+Gameplay. Binding of Isaac Rebirth is a dungeon crawler that is heavily reminiscent of the Legend of Zelda. It borrow a lot of aspects from it. If you liked the dungeon stuff in the Legend of Zelda, odds are you will like this. This game also is a nice balance of luck and skill. Luck is what items you get, and skill is how you use them.\n+Music. At first I didn't really like the music, but it really has started to grow on me.\n+Graphics. I hate the 16 bit graphics of this game, so why is this a positive? Because if you mozy your way over to the options, you can turn on a filter, which makes it less 16 bit. It's not the cartoony style of the original, but it's not the 16 bit of the Legend of Zelda.\n+Items. SO MANY ITEMS!\n+Never expected this to be on my positives, Lemon Mishap! That's right, the bane of the original, is now one of my favorite items. Hear me out! Hear me out! Lemon Mishap in this game forms a circle bigger than Monstro, which does massive damage to enemies, but only stays around for a couple of seconds. It is still a spacebar item, so it really makes you strategize with it.\n+Saving!\n\nNegatives:\n-Sound effects. Well not everything can be a winner. The sound effects are more less childish, which doesn't fit the game. Isaac's damage taking sound is a 5 year old going "Eeeehhh" and sometimes an enemy will shoot and make a sound more or less like "Pfft".\n-Death. I do like permadeath, but I don't like the after effects. I.E. starting a new game. Like I said, I like permadeath, but every time I die, I don't feel like I'm becoming my normal self after being a giant monster, I feel like I'm a giant monster with all my cool abilities taken away. It's hard to explain really. Think GTA V. You have every gun, and body armor, and then when you die, you lose all of your guns except for your pistol. It doesn't feel like you are becoming normal, it feels like your being downgraded.\n\nSo, what will I give this game? 8/10. Solid game, definitely deserving of being called a Binding of Isaac game.","November 25, 2014","true","399.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

I was so excited when I heard about this remake. I was waiting for months for this release.\n\nI honestly didn't care about the graphic change, i think its nice to see something different and I think I would even be disappointed if they didnt put the effort in a graphic change. It's a remake, so I also kinda expected a graphic overhaul.\n\nPlayed for sometime I immediatly fell in love with the new "feel" of the game. Overall a smoother game experience.\nThe thing that really annoyed me in the old game were the small hiccups that occured, or even that the game crashed when it was loading a XL floor, to me, a feeling that the old game truly was at its flash limits.\n\nCan't w8 to see all the combinations and unlocks possible. I'm sure that if you liked the old game, this game is a big improvement.\n\nPS. Only downside though are the crashes the come with the release..

It gets better with the filter, but not as smooth as the original game.\nThe music is also controversial, less melodic and hypnotizing than the original, but it has some great tracks and a lot of depth. Too bad that some tracks, like the one for the Caves, are dull and boring.\n\nIf you have never played Isaac, this is why this game is so good:\nThe atmosphere is unique and daunting, the procedural elements allow for very unique and different playthroughs each time thanks to the huge variety of items and the modifying effects they have on the game. Most importantly, the enemies are very well crafted, probably the best in any game I have seen as they all have different behavior, strength, weakness and patterns, and they have a huge impact on the gameplay.","December 24, 2014","true","25.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I quickly realized that the naked boy was the I should main character, I thought to myself: I shold've watched the intro to understand what's going on. I quickly ignored my little mistake because I saw a door made out of gold. My instinks told me that i should go and see whats in there. Inside the room was a pedestal, on that pedestal is a drop of p*ss. I thought to myself: Wow this has to be some valuable p*ss. I walked over to the drop and picked it up. My character stopped crying, he was smiling. I walked back into the empty room that i came from and saw three more doors, two of the doors looked regular but one of the doors had teeth. My instinkts told me to not go in there. I explored some more and found various rooms with different kinds of enemies inside. I killed all of them using my p*ss. After alot of merciless killing and destroying countless amounts of poop i saw another kind of door. This one had a skull over it and a red light could be seen. It seemed as i had no other choice than to go in there. A quick screen of me laying on the ground crying and a big living piece of poop called Dingle next to me.

My most hated pair is Lump/Peep+The Bloat.\n\nThe Binding of Isaac Rebirth/Afterbirth is an improvement on the original TBOI in every possible way, so it's absolutely not comparable to an expansion or mod. You can chose between different characters and have to lead him through the basement, cellar and many other floors while finding different helpful (or painful) items and killing a bunch of different enemies in every room. At the end of every stage you fight a boss and proceed to the next stage after collecting your reward. That's it. Easy to learn, hard to handle. Kind of a poop simulator. Endlessly replayable, every run is different and it never feels repetitive.\n\n++ pixel graphics (filter available for haters)\n++ save function implemented (finally!)\n++ new playable/unlockable characters\n++ different rooms\n++ hardmode\n++ new enemies/bosses\n++ over 400 collectibles, different hearts, chests, pills etc\n++ seeds for special/different runs\n++ better controls\n++ more challenges\n++ new areas and a new game mode\n++ local coop\n++ different endings\n\n-- Curse of the blind (I really hate it)\n\nSome last words: The proof that Cave Johnson was always right: "When life gives you lemons, reroll."\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReview für Binding of Isaac Rebirth und Afterbirth\n\nZuerst ein paar Worte über die Dinge, die ich während meiner TBOI Spielzeit gelernt habe:\nIss jede unbekannte Pille die du finden kannst, Krebs und Exophthalmus (oder Glubschaugen) sind großartig, berühre keine toten Katzen, ohne Augen kannst du nicht weinen, Bohnenfürze können Gegner töten, in Schei*e wühlen kann dich reich machen, Früchtekuchen ist böse und du kannst dich nicht entscheiden welchen Gegner/Boss du am meisten hasst. Meine Auswahl Lump/Peep+The Bloat.\n\nThe Binding of Isaac Rebirth/Afterbirth ist eine Verbesserung/Optimierung vom original Binding of Isaac in jeder nur erdenklichen Art und Weise, weswegen man es absolut nicht mit einer Erweiterung oder einem Mod vergleichen kann. Du kannst zwischen verschiedenen Charakteren wählen und diesen durch mehrere unterschiedliche Keller und Ebenen führen, verschiedene hilfreiche (oder schmerzhafte) Gegenstände finden und in jedem Raum eine Hand voll verschiedener Gegner töten. Am Ende jeder Ebene erwartet dich der Kampf gegen einen Boss, nach dem Sieg kannst du mit einer Belohnung zur nächsten Ebene fortfahren. Das ist alles. Einfach zu lernen, hart zu meistern. Hat ein wenig was von einem Poop Simulator. Unendlicher Wiederspielwert, jeder Run ist anders und fühlt sich nie monoton/gleich an.\n\n++ Pixel Grafik (Filter für Hater verfügbar)\n++ Speicherfunktion (Endlich!)\n++ neue spielbare/freischaltbare Charaktere\n++ unterschiedliche Räume\n++ Hardmode\n++ neue Gegner/Bosse\n++ über 400 Items, verschiedene Herzen, Kisten, Pillen etc\n++ Seeds for spezielle Runs\n++ bessere Steuerung\n++ mehr Herausforderungen\n++ neue Ebenen und ein neuer Spielmodus\n++ lokaler Koop\n++ verschiedene Enden\n\n-- Curse of the blind (Ich hasse es)\n\nEinige letzte Worte: Der Beweis dass Cave Johnson immer Recht hatte: "When life gives you lemons, reroll."","November 4, 2014","true","560.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

End of story. How could you possibly make it better? With improving everything it had. And that is what Rebirth did. It isn't just a remake, it also has quite a few things added, almost like an expansion. It added a whole bunch of items, some useful and some little less (I'm looking at you, Breath of Life...), more bosses, more rooms, better graphics, better sounds, better gameplay and BETTER POOP! There is one section the Original did better than Rebirth: music. Don't get me wrong, Rebirth's music is great and all, but Danny Baranowski's music was a masterpiece IN a masterpiece. Thankfully there is a mod, which replaces the new music with the old ones. This game is a masterpiece, so was the original.

Along the way, you pick up a series of items that affect your abilities in nifty ways, such as sharp things that make you cry harder, floating babies that cry at things with you, and demonic blood lasers that turn your tears into demonic blood lasers, as the name implies. The game itself follows a linear path, but to keep things fresh, each level is randomly generated, with every dungeon having a completely new layout and different items from whence last you played. There are also secrets you can only unlock by playing the game multiple times, so the replay value is pretty nuts.\n\nAs a remake, Rebirth trumps its predecessor in pretty much every way, with a new engine, silky smooth gameplay and a heaping wad of new items, rooms, characters and challenges acting as more than enough incentive for an upgrade, even if you’ve thoroughly enjoyed the original. New to the cast is a demon thing that shoots blood lasers. There are also some other guys.\n\nI myself have put several hours into this game and recommend that you do so as well if you value fun, challenges and laser tears. If you want to kill satan, gamble your life savings and sell your soul for dead cat parts within the span of thirty minutes, Rebirth is where you wanna be, dawg.","November 29, 2014","true","784.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I believe that this has been enough time for me to asess its gameplay/features and write a review.\n\nPros and Cons of Rebirth\nPros:\nRebirth has plenty of items (341) that you can collect which 'synergise' very well together and create wonderful combinations\nGreat replay value (seriously, there's 184 in game achievements)\nTwo player co-op\nSoundtrack is okay... kind of\nMultiple save files\nLots of new Challenges (20) to complete\nQuicker loading time than in the original\nNew bosses and regular enemies\nEnemies and bosses have been re-balanced\nFaster and smoother than the original Flash version\nNicer asthetics (animations and background details)\nDEM SYNERGIES SO DAMN GOOD\nSeeds allow you to perfect levels and practice as well as get easier runs\nNew 'Hard' difficulty allows Experienced players to feel more challenged\n4 new characters: Azazel, Lazarus, The Lost and Eden\nNew Guppy like 'Lord of the Flies' transformation as well as 'Bandage Girl' for Super Meat Boy\nCons:\nNew pixelated graphics aren't excactly everyone's favourite form of art\nHarder to get items since there're so many\nNew music can get annoying and repetetive\nMouse support requires going into the game files and acessing the config file from there\nToo expensive unless during a sale\nSeeds can be considered cheaty\nCertain Synergies can be game breakingly OP\nPermadeath can annoy certain people\nThe Lost is the most annoying character that you can play\nRuns are more inconsistant and are either really OP or really UP\nThe 'Filter' just makes everything blury causing your vision to lose focus (at least in my case)\nPoop jokes and Religous based content is REALLY obnoxious (I know Edmund's a Christian and he has certain beliefs that may be considered odd but it gets annoying when everything is either religously themed or just meme themed)\nMy Opinion\nTo me, Rebirth is a pretty good game. It's solid, playable (in both difficulty and bugs), has good replay value and kills time. Yes, I miss the old graphics. Yes, I hate that you have to go into the files to add mouse support. However, this game those what is says and says it very well. The poop jokes die quickly as well as the religous referancing but Rebirth not only adds even more content but makes me want to waste my time playing it!\n\nFinal Score\nI give Binding of Isaac: Rebirth an:  8/10   Because: it's a brilliant sequel but the asthetics have been greatly impaired and runs can be inconsistently OP/UP.\n\nEdits:\n02/04/205, Edited the review to inform about mouse support, thank you ShadoWatcher!\n31/12/2014, Fixed Pro comment being in the Cons section and vice versa","December 25, 2014","true","103.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

And Rebirth just makes this legendary game even more EPIC!\n\nFirst of all, I have 300+ hours of gameplay in the original. I wanted to play this game so bad, but I also had really high expectations. My first impression of the game (4 hours of gameplay) is 99% positive. I'll list some of the highlights:\n\nPositive:\n+ New graphics and lighting. TOTALLY AWESOME.\n+ LOCAL CO-OP MODE!\n+ Smoother gameplay, specially moving Isaac with a analog stick controller (I use a Dualshock 4).\n+ Lots of new stuff: New items, new item combos, new room types, new unlockable characters, new enemies and bosses, etc.\n+ Better synergy when you pick up different special items.\n+ Some of the old items were reworked to become more balanced/useful.\n+ Hard mode option, although I didn't try it yet.\n\nNeutral:\n- The soundtrack is really good and it's clear that those guys put a lot of work on it, but it's not as epic as the original, unfortunately.\n- I thought Rebirth would have a improved menu, with more details on items you have picked and secrets you have found. You still have to figure out what the items do by testing them during your gameplay. It can be either a positive or a negative thing. Personally, I'd like to see more details on the items.\n\nNegative:\n- Although Rebirth has the co-op mode option, you can't play it online with a friend. That's a bit annoying and the only real downside of this game so far.\n\nSummarizing, it's a HUGE improvement on the original BoI, and it's totally worth buying it if you're into rogue-like style and challenging games! And if you didn't play the original, you'll have TONS OF SECRETS to find.\n\nFinal Rating: 9.5/10","November 5, 2014","true","417.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

The randomly generated playthroughs are still largely dependant on skill, letting both old and new players enjoy the game so many a hour.\n\nIn comparison to the original binding of isaac...\n\nThe music is hit and miss. Some tracks I have even replaced with the original games, such as the caves/depths themes which I think are terrible in this version. Others, like hericide, are fantastic.\n\nThe game is much easier. Unless you're playing with the worst characters in the game you will almost certainly be able to win 80% of the time or more by the time you get every achievement. In the original game I was hitting 50% with the best character, while I got a 36 win streak in rebirth with the best character. Difficulty is fun, and I don't mean with stupid, abritrary limitations like "no item rooms" that take away from the fun of the game.\n\n\nAnyway if you own TBOI and didnt like it, dont get this.

The controls are extremely tight, and there are very few occasions where it feels like you are not in control of how your run goes. It's also marked by a near-infinite level of replayability, as the game is tough as nails if you can't break the initial barrier but becomes extremely satisfying and enjoyable if you manage to surpass it with a combination of your skill and game dynamics.\n\nThe main thing about Isaac that really stands out is that it takes the concept of breaking a game and builds an entire system of meta-gameplay around this, with secret bosses that practically require you to break your run in fun and empowering ways and unlocks that require hundreds of instances of experimentation and recombination of gameplay elements. The game has hundreds of hours of unlocks that really test your mettle and determination, and maybe thousands of hours more of pure unadulterated fun in replayability.\n\nPresentation 8/10\nStylish and fluid, the graphics are pretty stunning and not oversold by-the-numbers pixel-ification. There are subtle homages to pretty much the entire history of videogames, but despite being obvious to seasoned players they are presented in a very original and uncompromising way. The soundtrack and soud design is phenomenal and while not perfect really suits the game world and tone just as well as the visual feel.\n\nAccessibility 6/10\nThis, I think, is Isaac's greatest downfall, and i strongly believe it comes from the format of the game. Its random nature extends the gameplay in a way that means you will often have polarisingly difficult runs, from times when you can immediately tell you will win without much hassle to endless streaks of runs where you will be made to feel like a helpless fish out of water. It is the only element of the game that feels out of the player's control, especially when you're first starting out and don't completely know the ropes. I cannot say for sure what could remedy this, because it is sure to deter some players from continuing the experience, but it is certainly not such a sordid detail that it ruins the entire gameplay experience.\n\nOverall 8/10\nI cannot emphasise this enough: It is FUN. It can be a ♥♥♥♥♥ sometimes, but if you can allow yourself not to take the experience too seriously you are guaranteed to become totally submerged in all of its quirks and subtleties that create the immensely replayable experience of Isaac.","May 9","true","0.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

They really pulled out the stops on this one.  They use a new engine for this title and improve and expand the original game in alot of unexpected ways.\n\nAside from alot more achievements the actual game worlds are no longer just a collection of rooms in a grid.....now some rooms can be very differing shapes...enemies have been added and some changed, game play feels more fluid...and there is alot more to find in this title.\n\nI only cleared the game once....thus why my time as i write this is low.\n\nFor those that have played neither title here is the synopsis....there is a trailer that shows this as well and a nifty text description.\n\nYou are treated to a nice video as the game starts....about Isaac being a happy boy living with his mother.  One day his mother gets spoken to by what she thinks is god...and god tells her to do some things to prove herself to him.\n\nWell Isaac, over hears this....and fearing for his life....escapes to the basement below his room.....and thus the fantasy adventure begins.\n\nNo game so far I have played of this title has been the same.  There are unlockable characters and alot of things to find.  Tons of achievements and for the completists you can even collect items as the game keeps track of the things you find as you play.  Whihc in turn unlocks achievements.\n\nA friend has a twitch TV channel and tends to play this game a bit.\n<Shameless plug for the channel: http://www.twitch.tv/mr_bo_jenkins>\n\nIf you are interested in an interesting but dark humor full adventure role playing game.

All the great parts of the original Binding of Isaac have been retained, and (as far as I know) all of the bugs removed. The game runs very smoothly on nearly any computer. The pool of upgrades/items you can obtain during a playthrough has been increased from the original as well. With over 400 items available, you certainly won't be disappointed by a lack of diverse powerups to choose from. Also, since the floors are randomly generated similarily to a dungeon crawler, you'll be able to play through the game over and over again and never have the exact same experience more than once. But what if you did want to replay a really fun playthrough again? Rebirth has you covered there as well. With the new seed system, you can just type in the 8-digit code found on your pause screen in each playthrough and tada! Now you can play through again with the same room and floor layout (Items are retained as well).\n\nStory- Alright, to be honest, this isn't the game's strong point. But who would expect it to be? The roguelike genre is all about the gameplay, and the story takes a backseat here. While the story certainly isn't bad, in fact it is pretty funny, it just isn't the main focus of the game. If you played the original, you won't be getting any surprises here- Rebirth features the exact same story as the original, down to the cutscene that plays when you start the game for the first time. So while it really shouldn't affect your enjoyment of the overall title, if you want to play something that is very heavy in story, this is not your game.\n\nGraphics- Those of you who played the original will notice that the graphics have been changed from the thick lined/hand drawn styled....style, to the pixel art that is present in Rebirth. At first I wasn't too happy with this, as I had really enjoyed the art style of the original. However, after over 45 hours of playtime, I can easily say that I prefer the pixel art. Those who hate pixels with every fiber of their being have the option of turning on a filter which will smooth out the lines.\n\nSoundtrack- The soundtrack is in the same boat as the graphics. The original's soundtrack has been thrown out along with the original's graphics. many have complained about the new soundtrack, claiming that it doesn't quite live up to the one it replaced, but I personally find it difficult to decide which is better between the two. Both manage to do different things. The original was all about the atmosphere, especially in the later levels. Rebirth, however, features more guitars and sounds closer to a metal album. They both managed to fit well with the game, in my opinion, but if the soundtrack is a major point for you, I would recommend looking it up on youtube.\n\nTo sum it all up, I highly recommend this game to anybody and everybody who is able to find a way to play it.\n\nPros\nAmazing gameplay which somehow manages to improve upon the nearly original\nDetailed pixel art\nEnergetic soundtrack\nCons\nSoundtrack isn't quite as atmospheric as original\nPixel Graphics (if you aren't a fan of them)\n\n9.5/10","December 22, 2014","true","161.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

There is so much replayability that you can play forever and not get the same run. Its a perfect time waster as runs only last 20-30 minutes so its perfect for someone without a lot of time. Not much of a story but it doesnt need one, and its very difficult and will take a lot of time to learn each enemies moves/actions. If you like any game with difficulty, then this is the game for you.

There's new gimmicks and new items, monsters and rooms to explore. It feels like the enemies are a bit more varied. No longer is caves full of greed heads in every room. Though another unfair enemy has been introduced. Wall spiders with a triple shot. Luckily they're not that common.  There are more items too, a good thing? Yesnoyesno?  If you like an item, good luck getting it, because getting an item you like has less chance of appearing with every DLC.\n\nAtmosphere went down a little. The graphics are a bit more pixelated. There's an option to make it look like the old BoI but it still looks like a pixelated mess. The game feels a bit less evil too somehow. Maybe because there's so many farts around. Farting and obesity has been taking over evil, really. The good atmospheric feature is little waterstreams running over the wall. Fireflies in dark and secret rooms. A few extra details thrown it does make it pleasurable on the eyes.\n\nAudio went down, by a lot. I feel like the monster sounds just aren't as memorable. The undead floating babies used to give me goosebumps in BoI 1.  I can't think of a single memorable enemy sound anymore. The music is just noise. I was looking forward to having more BoI music to love and enjoy, as I did with the first game. Little inbetween songs such as ''Agony'' and ''Pride'' of the first game, they REALLY made the other game feel alive. Honestly, I can't think of a single inbetween-stage-musics right now, not even how they went... It just kinda blends in with all the other random noise.\n\nShould you buy this game?\n\nIt's hard... It's definitely not worth 15 euros. It's alright overal though. I'd say you wait until a sale. You won't be missing out on that much, but when you do have the game, you may enjoy yourself for several hours with it.

It's just too much fun.\n\nThe Binding of Isaac: Rebirth takes the fantastic formula of the original and supercharges it with nearly immeasureable amounts of content.  Much like the original, Rebirth is a challenging roguelike dungeon crawler with randomly generated levels and a plethora of creative and enjoyable power-ups.  The imagery is dark and unsettling, which complements the beautifully eerie soundtrack to create a powerful atmosphere.\n\nIf you're familiar with the original and are wondering what makes Rebirth different, then there is no shortage of things to mention.  Perhaps the most important difference is the major performance improvement.  The Binding of Isaac had notable performance issues, with many unfortunate players (myself included) unable to fully enjoy the game.  Rebirth is a far more stable game with significantly smoother gameplay.  As far as content goes, Rebirth adds several new characters, as well as new enemies, levels, power-ups, achievements, and items.  It also supports local co-op for multiple players on the same PC.  There is a new level seed feature where you can input a "seed" to play a specific level with the same randomized elements every time, which is fantastic for speedrunners or competing friends.\n\nWhile this game already has loads of replay value thanks to its randomized nature, I personally find it especially fun to replay as a completionist.  With a huge plethora of achievements, there is always more to do in this incredible game.  Highly recommended.","November 14, 2014","true","248.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/clocknik/recommended/250900/","clocknik","Dr. Clocknik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/clocknik/","339 products in account","Bursting forth from its parent game and glistening with vile secretions in the dim light of the basement, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth then proceeds to cannibalize that from which it grew, mutating it into a disgusting, disturbing (and possibly sacrilegious) beast that is in every way an improvement over its predecessor. Developer Nicalis has done an incredible job taking Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl's original The Binding of Isaac and transforming it into a tighter, smoother, and all-around better experience.\n\nJust like the previous game, Rebirth is a rogue-like game that borrows heavily in gameplay style and presentation from older iterations of The Legend of Zelda, presenting players with a top-down view of each floor of an ever expanding dungeon. Player upgrades, items, enemies, and floor layout are randomized with each playthrough as the player attempts to reach the end of the game. One of the best features of Rebirth (and the original game) is that by continually playing, the game expands itself more and more: beating the game unlocks new items, characters, and levels, making the experience grow each time you complete it! It's a title that contains a considerable heft of replayability, which works well with the "pick up and play" format of the game. On top of this, the old-school difficulty curve coupled with the knowledge that if you die you must start again at the beginning creates a very intense game once getting into the later levels.\n\nIt should be noted that I adored the original The Binding of Isaac and its DLC, managing to achieve 100% completion after 149 hours of play. However, the original had several major flaws: one of the biggest in particular being that it was Flash-based and (despite programmer Florian Himsl's best efforts) was buckling under the weight of its own content. Scores of bugs began presenting themselves as the game got more and more added to it, thanks to its unexpected popularity. Rebirth cleanses multitudes of issues thanks to Nicalis' superb job of creating an engine of their own and implementing new features not present in the original game. Players can now save their progress during a run and come back later, save slots are present for those sharing a computer, the game runs infinitely smoother, and the controls are much tighter and responsive than they were in the original game. Nicalis has also given it a lovely retro look and expanded the game's content immensely, adding scads of new items to the original game's inventory, new characters to the roster, and new challenges and game modes. It takes everything that the previous game had and expands upon all of it and does it incredibly well.\n\nIs it perfect? No, it's not perfect: I've seen some strange bugs here and there (in particular one that makes the game run far too fast) and did experience a fatal crash at one point. That being said, though, a fatal crash was a run-ending slap in the face when playing the original game; thanks to the new save system I was able to pick up exactly where I left off before the crash.\n\nAll of these things considered, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth renders its parent obsolete and I highly recommend it to fans of the original game, anyone who ever considered buying the original game, and those who enjoy retro-inspired rogue likes. It's the most fun you'll ever have escaping sacrifice to God by your own mother!","February 18, 2015","true","267.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Exactly what I was looking for/expecting. I have found some bugs with certain item combinations (for example 2 shot + 3 shot) I have yet to test those combinations with quad shot though. But I very much like the new Brimstone Baby, Devil Baby bum, and the items that work with Brimstone. Especially number one, which makes your Brimstone lazor YELLOW! Also the fact that there are 100s of new items, many that I have found do wonderful and interesting thing, making them great additions.\n\n\nIf you like Rogue-like Dungeon crawlers (this one being loosly based off of a Zelda dungeon structure) with a very interesting and unique art style with great character design, then you may wish to look at this game.\nI personally very muchy injoy the Pixel art look, but there is a option to but a filter on the game to make it slightly more reminiscent of the original game.\n\nDue to the addition of difficulty modes (normal and hard), hardcore players from the original (like myself) can enjoy the challenge of hard mode, while new players can enjoy being able to adjust and learn the game on normal and then perhaps change to hard mode (which you can anytime between runs).\n\nThough this is a remake of the original game (The Binding of Isaac), you do not have to have played the original whatsoever to get into this one, it is not nessasary nor do you gain any special additions by doing so. Unless you wish to feel the atmosphere of the original of course.\n\nAll in all, it was WELL worth the $10 I got it for (due to the fact that I own the original and got the preorder discount from owning said original).\nTherefore I would rate this game 9/10\nNot perfection, but they way the game is makes it feel like it shouldn't be.

And surprisingly enough, it turned out to be an amazing re-release of a poorly made, but addicting and fun flash game I somehow managed to play for over one hundred hours.\n\nFOR THE NEW PLAYERS:\nThe base concept of Binding of Isaac is about a little child name Isaac who is forced down into his basement due to his bible-crazed mother being told by voices in her head to sacrifice her son in the name of the lord. In the basement Isaac meets such lovable characters such as a blob with cleft palate, a giant ball of poop, and the four horsemen of the apocalypse.\n\nIf that doesn't sound appealing to you, It's much less gruesome than it sounds on paper. While you are popping pills and running around with steroid needles injected into you while wearing a gimp mask, you might realize that the cutesy artstyle and fastpaced gameplay desensitizes you from all the awful themes within the game. The game is quite fun and plays a lot like top down zeldas, only with hundreds of random items to collect and roguelike-like spawning and progression style gameplay. The game drags on at the start due to the lack of items, and overall isn't very good for bingeplays, but the content you're getting will keep you coming back for more and more and is definitely worth the price of purchase. Whenever you beat the game, the game gets longer and more complex.\n\nFOR THE RETURNING:\nThe game is basically the same, without looking like an awful flash game and with (literally) hundreds of more items and tons of new features. But all I can say is to play hardmode. The game seems to be drastically reduced difficulty wise in normal mode, to the point where I beat mom in my first try and mom's heart in my second. If that appeals to you, go for it! But if not, I highly recommend hardmode.\n\nThe new features are amazing. I cannot comment on the items in one sentence- as there is so many gamechangers that we'd be here forever and nobody would read my review. The new characters are quite interesting, and I don't see much point to playing Eden but Lazarus and Azazel are fun (and seem overpowered at first, but you learn their downfalls after a while). The challenges give good previews into the new features of the game, and I can safely say that lemon mishap still sucks the big one.\n\nOVERALL:\nGet it. This is probably the best roguelike-like on steam. Your life essence will drain from your pores as you behold your new god.","November 5, 2014","true","138.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Exactly what I was looking for/expecting. I have found some bugs with certain item combinations (for example 2 shot + 3 shot) I have yet to test those combinations with quad shot though. But I very much like the new Brimstone Baby, Devil Baby bum, and the items that work with Brimstone. Especially number one, which makes your Brimstone lazor YELLOW! Also the fact that there are 100s of new items, many that I have found do wonderful and interesting thing, making them great additions.\n\n\nIf you like Rogue-like Dungeon crawlers (this one being loosly based off of a Zelda dungeon structure) with a very interesting and unique art style with great character design, then you may wish to look at this game.\nI personally very muchy injoy the Pixel art look, but there is a option to but a filter on the game to make it slightly more reminiscent of the original game.\n\nDue to the addition of difficulty modes (normal and hard), hardcore players from the original (like myself) can enjoy the challenge of hard mode, while new players can enjoy being able to adjust and learn the game on normal and then perhaps change to hard mode (which you can anytime between runs).\n\nThough this is a remake of the original game (The Binding of Isaac), you do not have to have played the original whatsoever to get into this one, it is not nessasary nor do you gain any special additions by doing so. Unless you wish to feel the atmosphere of the original of course.\n\nAll in all, it was WELL worth the $10 I got it for (due to the fact that I own the original and got the preorder discount from owning said original).\nTherefore I would rate this game 9/10\nNot perfection, but they way the game is makes it feel like it shouldn't be. That it doesn't need to be absolutely polished, and that's the beauty of it. Thanks for reading my review. I hope you found it informative.","November 5, 2014","true","121.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The content was much larger than the previous game, the graphics changed to pixel art without changing the atmosphere of the game and it maintained the funny, simple and yet a little disturbing feel to it. The only aspect I didn't enjoy very well was the soundtrack. Although it's not actually bad, it's very different than the soundtrack of the original game, due to the absence of the creator of the original soundtrack in the development.\n\nOther than that, this game is a MUST have for the people who enjoyed the last game and still want more. A little more expensive than the original, but I garantee it, it's worth every single penny.","December 1, 2014","true","188.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

It is a fun time killer of a game. A lot of time if you are up for multiple replies and trying out different combos. My understanding is that this is the remake of the popular flash game The Binding of Isaac. Only this version is a complete rework. It has all the things people of vinalla Isaac know and love and brings a lot more items, bosses, and so on. So to those that spent many hours playing the orginial, you already know how this will work. They kept pretty much everything from back then. I can't say much to compare to the orginal. Only what I have heard. If you liked the first one, you'll love this one for sure. If you are curious about the game, try looking up some videos on youtube of game play or check out some videos/broadcasts here. Might be up your alley. I recommend it to anyone. A dark 2D rpg shooter type game. Lots of replay value if you are into completing everything there is to in the game. If you are one to just beat a game and be done with it, then you can skip this game. It would feel to short for you. The challenge though is there if you want to give it a go.","February 3, 2015","true","281.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I later found a script I could apply to J2K and suddenly, the controls were sublime and I fell in love with poor Isaac and his issues with his mother.\n\nI hammered home over 150 hours at that game, and couldn't stop, however, I never 100%ed the game, because all of a sudden, Rebirth was released.\n\nRebirth is everything that the original was plus tons more. The items are all fantastic fun to figure out, the latest synergies between items ensure you're always finding new ways to use what you find in game, and the graphics are a notable improvement over the original.\n\nThe funny about this release was that initially, I HATED the graphics. They seemed grainy and a fallback from how they used to look. Over time, they seem to have grown on me, and I don't even notice them anymore, what with all of Isaac's items swamping his poor little frame. The levels have taken on quite a change, with 2x1 and 2x2 sized rooms, as opposed to it always being 1 screen rooms in the original. This gives you a huge amount of variety with the +4 Billion seeds on offer and you'll never see the same game twice.\n\nThe difficulty is about the same, despite their being a 'harder' mode. This mode doesn't feel much harder, and there's plenty that the guys who made the game could have done to increase the challenge for the more hardcore of us out there.\n\nHowever, not everything that changed succeeded. The music is just DREADFUL. To the point that I found someone had created a patch of sorts which replaced the new music with the old soundtrack, and suddenly everything was blissful again. It's just terrible. Either turn it off, or bring back the classic OST.\n\nThe value to be found within this title is incredible, and if it's a shooter with challenge that you want, you have to try this. The humour's fantastic, everytime you play it feels a different game, and if you find yourself enjoying it, you'll likely never stop playing.","February 8, 2015","true","365.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You probably already have rebirth, and if you don't then get it right now, just click up there to add it to checkout and get it.  Its the new-and-improved Isaac.  Just go.\n\nIf you DON'T have the original Isaac and have absolutely no idea what an Isaac is, i shall fill you in.\n\nThe original Binding of Isaac was released early September 2011 for steam for 5 bucks.  And for about a year, it was the best goddang thing that was worth 5 bucks on steam.  It's a top-down, Zeld-esque twinstick Rogue-Lite made by the man behind Super Meat Boy and Time ♥♥♥♥, Edmund Mcmillen.  It follows the story of a little boy named Isaac who must defend himself from his deranged mother who apparently has been told by God that Isaac is full of sin and must be sacrificed to God to be saved.  Isaac escapes to his basement and thats where you begin.\n\nAnd you will not believe the literal ♥♥♥♥ you find.\n\nLost brothers and sisters, mutated and deformed beyond recognition, all sorts of deadly and creepy creatures, all out for your head on a silver platter.  And you have to cry on them to kill them.  The orignal Isaac is a demented, sick, balls-to-the-walls hard game that tests your skill, strategy, reflexes, and most of all, your sanity.  Each level is randomly generated, so never expect things to go exactly the same each time.  One room may be very simple, while the next is crazy difficult.  But still, the game tends to get progressively harder the farther down you go.  The further down you go, the weirder and creepier enemies you meet, the more difficult bosses you have to kill, and more and more you literally delve into the madness of a naked 2-3 year old boy forced to horribly kill all these creatures. Backed by a wonderful soundtrack from the master himself Danny Baranowsky, playing Isaac was nothing short of an experience.  Thankfully, the levels arent the only thing random.  You'll find items progressively throughout each run, each one changing isaac both stat-wise and look-wise, turning him slowly in your own personal Rob Zombie photo.  Some are good, some are bad, some are weird, some break the game, some break your chances at the game, but all of them can be used in an interesting and useful way.  Each run is made that much more interesting by the items you get, and it makes the game that much more fun.  But the game retains its diffuclty all the way, never letting up.  Speaking of runs, thats also one of Isaacs main mechanics.  The game is meant to be played multiple times, as each run usually lasts from 20-40 minutes depending on how far you go.  Most early runs can unlock bunches of new items and characters to play as, each character a good amount different from the rest.\n\nThe Binding of Isaac quickly became an underground hit, and soon enough the Roguelike had been reborn thanks to its incredible success.  It became so successful that an expansion was released, Wrath of the Lamb, adding nearly a hundred new items, alternate stages, new end-game levels, and even more enemies and bosses out to kill you.\n\nHowever, Edmund believed that, now with Isaacs popularity shown, the game hadn't experienced the concepts full potential, probably due to the original version being made in only a few months.  The game needed to be remade, redone, reimagined.\n\nRebirthed.\n\nOver the course of 2 years, Edmund worked with Nicalis' own Tyrone Rodriguez and many at Nicalis and even some in the Isaac community(like Spider, who was one of the first to study Isaacs internal coding and created Spidermod) to create the ultimate Isaac experience.  The game was rebuilt from the ground up with a new engine, remodeled in 16 bit-style graphics instead of the originals Flash and MS Paint look, and made to fix and improve everything from the original.  Matthias Bossi, the narrator from the original Isaac, and Jon Evans of Ridiculon, worked together to make a completely new and improved soundtrack, and the result was Binding of Isaac: Rebirth.\n\nThe greatest roguelike in history.\n\nRebirth is faster, crazier, and even more amazing than the original isaac.  The new engine runs at an amazing 60FPS 100% of the time, removing any old problems with lag-spikes due to Flash.  Over a hundred new items added, a lot of them interesting and sometimes hilarious upgrades that make runs that much more fun.  Double the amount of horrifying Lovecraftian monstrosities to kill and be killed by.  More stages and extra endings to get a full view of the Isaac storyline.  And to add upon that, you can avoid going alone.  Local Co-op, well made to suit Rebirth and extremely fun for a pair of friends out to conquer Heaven or Hell.  Everything in Rebirth is improved, many items getting buffed, new mechanics adding depth to the game, bunches of new rooms to learn, and loads of crazy new synergies between new and old items.\n\nTo put it simply, Rebirth is the ultimate roguelike experience.  If you want to delve into the weird and never go back, if you want to learn the many ways how a awesome game is still ♥♥♥♥♥♥, if you want to sacrifice your 3 life containers in a deal with Edmund to one single game, make that game Binding of Isaac: Rebirth.","November 22, 2014","true","400.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Boss fights aren’t that similar anymore, I found it redundant to make them that way in the original as it’s just a reskin of them same boss and felt like an excuse just to extend gameplay\nSamson fells more enjoyable to play (I never play as him in the first one and I still don’t but every time I do, it is noticeable better than the original game)\nImprovement of some items that were in the original\nCharacter transformations based of getting 3 certain items of a set (my favourite improvement of them all)\nAvailably of harder difficulties for people that may want them.The only petty quality about it in comparison to the first game is the soundtrack.\n\n\nThis game has many wondering attributes that I felt that makes the game a joyous experience.\nPositives:\nLOADS of items to find/unlock and play around with. I just get excited whenever I go into a treasure room and expect the huge possibilities of what might be that I feel keeps the game fresh for a long period of time.\nPLENTY of great item synergies. Synergies are when you combine 2 effects of an item to make them have a unique and deadly effect. There’s just so many it keep my curiosity anticipating the ‘what if’ when I see items that could make or break my run. My favourite is Brimstone + Tiny Planet or Spoon Bender.\nHuge variety of characters all with unique characteristics and stats to make them feel as if they’re not just reskins.\nHours of gameplay and discovery.\nBut the game isn’t perfect, I’ll list the negatives I feel that make the game take a step in the wrong direction that probably can be justified.\nNegatives:\nSome items feel like they exist just to hinder you.\nSometimes it feels this game doesn’t let you perform to the best of your capabilities because you weren’t lucky enough to find decent (e.g. not finding enough keys which leads to skipping 60% of treasure rooms, granted that is genuinely unlucky). However if you find the whole luck factor unenjoyable, you can fully plan a run with seeds which ‘kind of’ makes up for this negative.\nSome characters despite being harder to play as rarely make up for it (I fully understand the developers intended this).\nPop up enemies can be easily frustrating. Most of the time, it feels more of a patience mind game rather than actual gameplay. It’s genuinely unfair having an enemy pop up right under your feet, instantly hurting you then getting away with it while waiting again or waiting in irritation for 3 minutes in a room full of pop-up enemies/bosses taking so long to give you a chance to kill them!\nCharacter movements ‘could’ be better. Don’t get me wrong, the character moments are great in the game but it’s kind of gets me down whenever I’m weaving through enemy bullets or failing to use terrain as a shield when having flight because the light movement input was still a little too much and take more than 3 tries to get it right. Trust me, it’s not as bad as I make it sound.\n\nI would rate this game 8/10.\n\n\n\nTL:DR SummaryMay not be the best game, has a lot of ups and content. Has some minor downs but is still very enjoyable, would rate 8/10.","December 13, 2014","true","113.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hymnals/recommended/250900/","Hymnals","Hymnals","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hymnals/","81 products in account","So I'm going to preface this by saying that, I've spent a lot more time ingame than steam says. I've spent ~3k hours on vanilla, and ~500 in this one. I mostly play offline to be free of distraction, especially when speedrunning.\n\nSo there are a few important things about this game, and the series.\n\nThe most important thing is of course, the game itself. It's a pseudo-roguelike, with some saying it is, and some saying it's not. The game is a top down, twin-stick, procedurally generate, dungeon-crawler.\n\nBut that's not important.\n\nIf you really want to know what it's about, here:\n\nA naked child, running around, killing his own worst nightmares that have manifested into his reality. With his tears.\nif you enjoy popping poop and crying a whole lot, you'll love this game. If you don't, you'l probably still love this game.\n\nIt's unique in the fact that the game has synergies that make it exciting. A significant portion of the items synergise with eachother in quite unique ways. Edmund McMillan and Nicalis have gone above and beyond the expectations for item synergy, and are even adding to that in the DLC set for October 30th!\n\nThe next big thing about the game is the community.\n\nIsaac is a game that is streamed and recorded quite a bit.\n\nThe thing is, you can learn a lot about the game by just watching people play it. Be it some obscure mechanic that helps you in the future, or some item synergy you haven't seen before, waching others play is a great experience.\n\nSome of the most influential figures in this regard are:\n\nNorthernlion (https://www.youtube.com/user/Northernlion): The scumlord. He throws won runs, wins thrown runs, and generally makes plays that make you both laugh and cry. that plus his amazing voice make him a friendly resource for beginners to understand how unintimidating the game can be if approached right!\n\nBisnap (https://www.youtube.com/user/Bisnap): He's pretty good at the game. He is probably one of the most analytical players of the game, and provides insightful commentary as well as a good explanation as to why he made some of his more confusing plays!\n\nCobaltstreak (http://www.twitch.tv/cobaltstreak): He is generally a very skilled, and slightly crazy player. He was one of the first, if not the first person/people to get Real Platinum God, and beat the secret character to completion. Now he streams his Eden streaks, winning more than a hundred matches in a row before finally losing one!\n\nThe other side of the community are the people who serve as figureheads for learning! Be it by modding, or making a website to help with your every Isaac need, there are people who are there for it.\n\nhttp://moddingofisaac.com/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/\n\nThose sites are two great modding resources, and if you're interested in learning, come check out the wiki on the second link!\n\nAnd then there is http://platinumgod.co.uk/\n\nDedicated community member Elucidator (https://twitter.com/eluc_) maintains one of the best community resource sites for the game.\n\nSo basically, Isaac isn't just a game. It's a game driven by an outstanding community that has always supported itself and keeps the Isaac experience amazing.\n\nSo I guess I'm saying that you should totally buy the game.","September 21, 2015","true","277.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In the original tale god is descending at the last minute to tell Abe that he was "just kidding, I only told you to murder your own son to see if you're a filthy child killer and it turns out you are but you don't have to go through with it but seriously, ♥♥♥♥ you!" I might misremember things and paint god as a more sympathetic character. In this version no one is preventing Isaac from getting killed except Isaac himself. With super-powered projectile tears he battles his way out of a nightmare. Or does he venture further in? Doesn't matter, you shoot ♥♥♥♥ and and pick up stuff that makes you shoot different kinds of tears or change your projectile completely. OR give you different benefits altogether. It's like Binding of Isaac only flash is no longer the true final boss.

Everything from the original game is still in place, and most likely works better than what you remember. It has a great all new soundtrack, new art, and plenty of new content you could've never imagined. I own the game on every platform available to me, N3ds, Xbox 1, and Playstation vita.\n\nWith the recent addition of the expansion Afterbirth, i've decided to update my review, and sure I could write a review for afterbirth specifically, but I think this is more suitable. With or without the DLC content, the game is so worth the money.\n\nAfterbirth is a huge addition, to an already great game. New music, game mode, unlocks, character(s), items, trinkets, consumables, secrets, and daily challenges.\n\nDaily challenges really give the game more life. All items are unlocked for everyone in the daily challenges, so even a complete noob can get the same experience everyone else has had. Its unfortunate that people cheat on the daily run. You can't really blame the devs for this one, its all the community.\n\nGreed mode is a new game mode that plays out in waves of enemies, and the reward being cash money. You progress through the game mode by hoarding the shop for its best items, and you will end up at ultra greed, a new boss which will likely give you a run for your money. Overall I think its a very fun game mode, but some of the unlocks require grinding out greed mode (not cool!).\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough.","March 4, 2015","true","056.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game is fun, enjoyable and has loads to offer in terms of content. Let’s start what they improved from the original Binding of Isaac game.\n\nOriginal VS Rebirth Improvements:\nImprovements to the Mom, Isaac and ??? boss fight.\nIsaac/??? Boss fights aren’t that similar anymore, I found it redundant to make them that way in the original as it’s just a reskin of them same boss and felt like an excuse just to extend gameplay\nSamson fells more enjoyable to play (I never play as him in the first one and I still don’t but every time I do, it is noticeable better than the original game)\nImprovement of some items that were in the original\nCharacter transformations based of getting 3 certain items of a set (my favourite improvement of them all)\nAvailably of harder difficulties for people that may want them.The only petty quality about it in comparison to the first game is the soundtrack.\n\n\nThis game has many wondering attributes that I felt that makes the game a joyous experience.\nPositives:\nLOADS of items to find/unlock and play around with. I just get excited whenever I go into a treasure room and expect the huge possibilities of what might be that I feel keeps the game fresh for a long period of time.\nPLENTY of great item synergies. Synergies are when you combine 2 effects of an item to make them have a unique and deadly effect. There’s just so many it keep my curiosity anticipating the ‘what if’ when I see items that could make or break my run. My favourite is Brimstone + Tiny Planet or Spoon Bender.\nHuge variety of characters all with unique characteristics and stats to make them feel as if they’re not just reskins.\nHours of gameplay and discovery.\nBut the game isn’t perfect, I’ll list the negatives I feel that make the game take a step in the wrong direction that probably can be justified.\nNegatives:\nSome items feel like they exist just to hinder you.\nSometimes it feels this game doesn’t let you perform to the best of your capabilities because you weren’t lucky enough to find decent (e.g. not finding enough keys which leads to skipping 60% of treasure rooms, granted that is genuinely unlucky). However if you find the whole luck factor unenjoyable, you can fully plan a run with seeds which ‘kind of’ makes up for this negative.\nSome characters despite being harder to play as rarely make up for it (I fully understand the developers intended this).\nPop up enemies can be easily frustrating. Most of the time, it feels more of a patience mind game rather than actual gameplay. It’s genuinely unfair having an enemy pop up right under your feet, instantly hurting you then getting away with it while waiting again or waiting in irritation for 3 minutes in a room full of pop-up enemies/bosses taking so long to give you a chance to kill them!\nCharacter movements ‘could’ be better. Don’t get me wrong, the character moments are great in the game but it’s kind of gets me down whenever I’m weaving through enemy bullets or failing to use terrain as a shield when having flight because the light movement input was still a little too much and take more than 3 tries to get it right. Trust me, it’s not as bad as I make it sound.\n\nI would rate this game 8/10.\n\n\n\nTL:DR SummaryMay not be the best game, has a lot of ups and content. Has some minor downs but is still very enjoyable, would rate 8/10.","December 13, 2014","true","113.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

With great music, random runs and tense fights every room, it will scare you more than any next-gen game out there. I have played this game for over 50 hours, and I have not even scratched the surface of this game's full glory. With random seeds spicing up runs so you never get bored, plus the game having unique items that can ether ruin or totally carry or run, will really have you begging to mlgesus for that one extra soul heart for good measure, or good items in your shop/item rooms, or you praying that Bob's Rotten Brain does not spawn in your azazel run. But, in all and all, this game is a great game, perfect for when you are bored or on a long ride/flight.  But , heed this word of advice; A. If you have low range,  NEVER  pick up Bob's Rotten Brain, or you will suffer exploding pain. B. Try not to pick up Soy milk, it is really tricky to use. C. If you hate a run a lot, holding R will restart your run with the same character, but with a different seed. D. Unless you are sure  DO NOT PICK UP DEAD CAT   It takes away all but one red heart container, and gives you 9 lives  E.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smokingdogtreats/recommended/250900/","smokingdogtreats","Day Man Champion of the Sun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smokingdogtreats/","240 products in account","Okay, so my first review for this game was kind of shotty and I re read and then hated myself for writing it. These are more collective thoughts on the game after I've played it a little bit more and went back to the original to look at the diffrences in the games.\n\nThings I liked about this game\n\nGameplay\n\nOverall, the gameplay was really nice. The controller support was an amazing addition and I found myself using the controler over the keyboard becuase it was much easier to control then using arrow keys. The boss battles were fun espically near the end of the game when you have a ton of items and your heart is beating out of your chest as your hp drops to one heart. Those moments are what drove me to keep playing this game. Items felt like each one had a huge impact on the game to get, nothing seemed small and a lot of them could be complete run breakers so even more so then the previous game knowing what items did was crucial. Rooms in general had such a large vairty of layout that it never really felt the same it was always a new experience. Getting hit anywere always made me cuss under my breath knowing how hard it could be to find health unless you really scavanged the areas which was one of my favorite parts of the harder difficultes.\n\nGraphics\n\nOverall the graphics looked really nice, the little effects that were added to this game helped imerse me into the world more then in the previous game. The 16 Bit style was done really nicley in this game and I could still tell all of the previous eniemes from the past game was. It all seemed new but not new enough to make me forget what game I was playing.\n\nReplay-Ability\n\nTHe later levels of this game really shined. If i lost, I kept wanting to go back to it to try and get farther then I had the previous time. Random level design and room design mixed with a large amount of diffrent items that all did something diffrent from the last means that no run is every exactly the same, so it still feels fresh after around the 300th death and restart. Achivements could never be gotten in the a single run and you had to get the right circumstances a lot of the time to even get half of them which isnt a bad thing, it drove me to play it again.\n\n\nThings I did not like\n\n\nGameplay\n\nWhile there was a lot of diffrent things that could happen in this game as far as characters go there was a sumpreme lack of difference, the only really things that changed were stats none of the characters besdies Azel really changed how you had to play the game. We were told that Samson might be more of a melee character which would have been really cool to see but nothing was relesed on that and he just ended up being the same guy he was in the last game except with a few buffs to blood lust. I found myself playing Azel more of the time becuase it was something diffrent then the same mundane tears that you had to start off with. That actually ties into another big problem I had with this game, starting out. The first three of four levels of the game felt so slow and dragged out to me, your damage was usually very low and it took forever to bring one enemy down. It felt more like a chore to get through then actually playing. This was strengthed after having a really really good run and then seeing issac or whoever you may be playing having these little tears shoot out after experiencing knives going every which way. Other issues that I had involved that were run breakers, as I stated earlier you had to know what each item did but to a first time player seeing the cursed eye it looks really similar to another item. I know the game is supposed to be difficult but let that be in the fighting now having a single item that looks very similar to another trash an entire run.\n\nGraphics\n\nEven though the 16bit style has a bit of a charm to it, I feel it's a  little over played in video games today. It can look very beautiful if done correctly and it in no way dosent in this game but I really enjoyed the original style. I wish it had kept to that except gotten a big overhall in how things looked, even with all the graphical glitches and other varius issues the original game had I liked the art style so much better. It made bosses feel more challenging for me, it made mom feel more threatening. When i saw the pixaleted mom foot drop down I almost laughed a little becuase even though yes it still looked threatining the 16bit style took a large amount of the impact tha game had on me.\n\nReplay-Ability\n\nI'm going to restate a lot that I said in gameplay here but go into more detail. A perfect example of the bordem that I suffered in the first two levels was after about a week or so of not playing the game I decided to boot it back up and give it another shot. I picked issac and started shooting at an enemy, after realizing how slow my shots were and how long it was taking the enemy to die then seeing that happen room after room after room on the first floor I gave up on playing it. A lot of the time I had to froce myself through the first few levels becuase I knew how much I enjoyed the later levels. The only fun I really had constantly going back was with Azel becuase enimes that didnt pose any threat died way quicker then other people. Even though the rooms were randomly generated and you didnt see the same room all the time, after a while of playing that didnt seem to matter to me. The rooms seemed the same, the same colors the same the same things to kill. I really wish there was a varient in all of that, even if the same creatures had a randomly generated apperence but still stayed the same morphies flesh blob that it used to be. It would make everything seem a lot more fresh to me.\n\nOverall\n7.5/10\n\nI would still buy it, for the cost it should give you more then enough play time before you start to notice all of the things that I pointed out.\n\n","August 19, 2015","true","62.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game is very similar to Zelda 1, where the player tranverses dungeons, killing enemies (with his own tears. I'll get there) and destroying bosses and going deeper and deeper into the sanity of Isaac. The game is very famous for it's controversial story, taking a stab at religious groups.\n\nIn the story, Isaac is a little boy who lives with his christian mom, until the mom hears a voice from above, which she assumes is her God, and the voice asks for her to cleanse his son, by taking everything that is fun in his life, such as his toys, drawings and his clothes. The voice isn't satisfied yet, so it demands a sacrifice of Isaac (much like the biblical story), but Isaac manages to escape her psycho mom by going down a trapdoor hidden on a carpet, and going down to unknown depths below, eventually being powerful enough to face her mom again.\n\nThe gameplay consists of Isaac killing monsters at his basement with his own tears (because he's sad that his mom left him), dodging enemy bullets, going to item rooms to get items and be more powerful and killing the boss of the floor to get deeper. After certain conditions are met, you get to do a Deal with the Devil, where you trade your health containers (you can get them from HP ups) for usually damage items, with some exceptions. Most of the floors contains a item room and a shop where you can spend money for other resources and items.\n\nIsaac collects pennies, keys, bombs, pills, tarot cards, runes and trinkets (they work like temporary items). Pennies can be used to play on slot machines and buy items on the shop, bombs can be used to make pathways or combat, and keys open locked chests and locked doors. Pills, tarot cards and runes stay on a slot until you use them, and each one of them has a different effect, like teleportation, or a stat up.\n\nRebirth is a classic rogue-like, and definately worth your money. Most of the complaints are of it's luck based runs, but with enough practice, you can beat the game without many items. And all the runs have a way to turn overpowered, just need to learn and make good decisions.\n\n10/10.001","December 27, 2015","true","258.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

With great music, random runs and tense fights every room, it will scare you more than any next-gen game out there. I have played this game for over 50 hours, and I have not even scratched the surface of this game's full glory. With random seeds spicing up runs so you never get bored, plus the game having unique items that can ether ruin or totally carry or run, will really have you begging to mlgesus for that one extra soul heart for good measure, or good items in your shop/item rooms, or you praying that Bob's Rotten Brain does not spawn in your azazel run. But, in all and all, this game is a great game, perfect for when you are bored or on a long ride/flight.  But , heed this word of advice; A. If you have low range,  NEVER  pick up Bob's Rotten Brain, or you will suffer exploding pain. B. Try not to pick up Soy milk, it is really tricky to use. C. If you hate a run a lot, holding R will restart your run with the same character, but with a different seed. D. Unless you are sure  DO NOT PICK UP DEAD CAT   It takes away all but one red heart container, and gives you 9 lives  E.

However, just an hour with the game dashed that thought from my mind completely. Although the aesthetic and certain audio changes (especially the original music and the fact that Isaac now sounds his age) leave an uncanny feeling with myself, who played the original for a remarkably long time, I feel the engine change has overall benefitted the game. The environments feel darker, and despite the supposed visual downgrade to the pixellated style of yesteryear, even more genuine. The darkness (although occassionally obscuring darkly colored enemies in later, black-er levels) really ups the tension. The music also fits, although regrettably I must admit it has yet to impress me like Mr. Baranowsky's did in the original. The gameplay feels smoother than it did before, as well as looking smoother thanks to the upgrade to a constant 60 FPS. The amount of content, although I have yet to experience much of it, seems to have vastly improved; almost half of the items and enemies in my first playthrough seemed to be brand new. While I cannot speak for those who have not played the original, I picked up the old controls like a bicycle; while it got a bit quirky when I received what I believe was a new item (a cursed eye?) which gave me the ability to charge shots in order to shoot up to four or five at once, my experience with it so far seems that the familiar controls are as comfortable as before. While I must reserve full judgement until I have had more experience with the game, Rebirth is as engaging an experience as its predecessor, presenting the same elements that made it great and improved it through content and a very beneficial engine upgrade.","November 4, 2014","true","104.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/poongoolie/recommended/250900/","poongoolie","the best","http://steamcommunity.com/id/poongoolie/","390 products in account","Even though this is one of the best roguelikes I've ever played, it seems to be made by a complete idiot. A guy who hates fun and fair challenge.\n\nThere is a crazy amount of replayability in this because of the huge amount of upgrades and unlocks. Even with the hours I have, I still find myself experiencing new hilarious or broken combos through the random upgrades. It's a great time seeing what your first upgrade will be, and finding synergies for it.\n\nThe presentation is mostly good. The art/environment is pretty good. The fighting is good. The items are fun. The challenges are fun. Resources matter. Almost everything is pretty fun.\n\nBut then you see the game is riddled with ♥♥♥♥ only Edmund Mcdumdum would leave in which poison a great game. A quick list would include the piece of crap money spending system, unavoidable damage, unfun bad runs, grinding, hidden information and, stemming from that, items that will kill your run instantly because they are pure crap and you don't know until you take it.\n\nMONEY\nWhile the shop system itself is decent enough and even fun, other ways of spending your currency are TERRIBLE.\nShops - These are actually a pretty good design overall. You know it probably isn't worth wasting a key for a shop if you have under 15 pennies and don't need small heals, and they can really help you succeed on any given run.\n\nSlot machines and skull game - these let you pay 1 penny at a time for a x% chance of a small reward, or nothing at all. While a fine concept, it turns into grinding. Many times you will end up with a huge surplus of coins and near the end of the game, this might be the only way to spend money. In a difficult run you want to do all you can to win, don't you? What this equates to, way too often, is slamming your face against a slot machine or skull game for 5 minutes hoping to get something because you can only donate 1 penny at a time. So choose: either grind for several minutes, or leave and pass up an increased chance of success. THIS COULD BE FIXED BY SIMPLY ALLOWING US TO DONATE MORE AT A TIME. WHAT THE HELL EDMUND. Edmund loves to waste your time instead of letting you play a game. I cannot believe this has not been fixed even since the first game.\n\nBeggars - Another good way of spending pennies that isn't cancerous and grindy. Spending a penny, one at a time, gives a chance of a small resource drop or a full-on upgrade. This is actually acceptable to give only one at a time because the beggar takes them faster than slot machines or skull games do, and you will usually not even need to give 20 pennies before the beggar goes away. This takes like 20 seconds compared to the several minutes of slamming your head against a wall with the slots.\nUNAVOIDABLE DAMAGE\nThe more this game is updated, the more unavoidable damage that keeps finding its way into the game. Sometimes getting hit really, really matters. And it sure matters if your'e going for the no-damage achievements. There is even a character who dies in one hit. Too many times you get damaged because of a stat check or an enemy's design combined with a room's design. Some examples, but not limited to:\nSuicide bombers - Very fast movement and enough life to take a couple hits, unless you were lucky with damage upgrades. If you don't have a good speed stat or a good damage stat, you will be hit in a small room. Sorry. Deal with it. Goodbye no-damage run, or goodbye because you were low on hearts already. If the bombers are bunched up a little better when you get into the room, you might be able to run around them. Suicide bomber problems are not too rare.\n\nCreep - Puddles of damage left on the floor by enemies. At certain times, especially in the small-sized boss rooms, you might be left with nowhere to move and be forced to walk onto the stuff or just eat a bullet because you can't move. Congrats - you just got hit. This is pretty rare, at least.\n\nEnemy Brimstone - There is one boss who shoots a beam of damage and makes it spin around the room from its origin...it's a classic gaming convention; memories of Contra 3. The problem with it is that the boss position is random. If he is against a wall then, well...congrats - you just got hit.\n\nRoom shape + enemy AI - Some rooms do not give you space to move; there is a single path the size of your character that goes around the room. See any fast enemies or is your damage just too low? Well congrats - you just got hit.\nUNFUN BAD RUNS\nI know bad runs are an important part of the genre, but it doesn't mean a bad run can't be fun. This game handles the existence of bad runs awfully. In many games, a hard run is hard because it's hard to dodge things, or just that fighting is hard in general and you don't have great items. In this game....it is hard because you will spend 15 seconds on one stupid enemy because you're a weak peice of crap. He's still gonna stand there like a dumbass, or just limp at you like a ♥♥♥♥♥ while you pelt peas at him as you circle the room. Wow, skill. Actually it's just wasting my time. Much of the time, being too weak just makes rooms take insanely long and makes the game boring. Weakness should be introduced in a way that doesn't make the game take literally 10 times as long, such as enemies being able to beat your face in harder; not by forcing me to kite each stupid guy around a room for 30 seconds while I'm yawning.\n\nBosses are even worse as they might take several minutes when you're a weak peice of crap. A lot of them this doesn't even make harder. It makes them a grind. You will be doing the same stupid predictible dodging pattern on a boss for about 6 years and falling asleep until you lose concentration out of boredom. A challenge is fun, but a 'challenge' that makes me spend disgusting amounts of time walking around a room basically invincible is not fun. Not all bosses are easy like that, but that doesn't make it any more fun dodging the same attack for 3 minutes while throwing ping pong balls.\n\nHard runs like this also often force you to slam your face against slot machines all day. Ugh....\n\nIntroduce a challenge that isn't about wasting time and gross repitition.\n\nGRINDING\nThough a recurring element elsewhere, this is mostly about donation machines. You can put pennies into donation machines that are usually just in stores for the benefit of upgrades and bonuses that is persistent through runs. This is fun! But wait...\n\nHaving a big money run and ready to spend that juicystack of 99 pennies in the donation machine? Well there is a chance that the machine jams for no reason. Congrats - you just donated like 3 pennies and now can't donate until the next run.\n\nThis is especially bad in greed mode where you can't even donate until the end of the game. Not only is it tough to have pennies left by the end of greed mode, the last boss makes you drop pennies when hit. This is all pretty okay. The real problem is that the greed machine, once it's at a pretty good donation rate, has up to 20% chance of jamming. Trying to get 999 pennies in there to unlock the extra character? Well I hope you like beating the whole game for the chance to insert a whole penny :-) thanks for the grind. I like when games are about grinding and luck instead of skill so this is great for me.\n\nContinued in comments.","February 29","true","200.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","5"

I finished every achievement, and had a lot of fun doing so. But it was not always fun. There were times when I raged like a gorilla. It is important not to give up in this game.\nSo I recommend this to everyone who doesn't give up after 10 minutes of gameplay. First reason is because it takes a good while to get fimiliar with the game. There are lots of items, all of which do something else, and getting to know them takes a long long time. Ofcourse you could look them up on the internet, which I did at times, or you could just use the hints given by the game to figure out what every item does.  Secondly, the game works in runs. You play the same maps every time, in the same order, except randomly generated with seeds. So even though it is always the same, it is never the same. If you think this will bore you quickly, then I would not buy this game.\nThe enemies are always strong, but you are not always. It depends on your randomly generated seed, what items will drop, and items are what makes you strong. So you need to pray to RNJesus that your seed will have strong items. If you do get them, however, you're gonna have a great time. Items being all different, is also the case with enemies and bosses. None are alike, they are all different in their patterns and attacks. It requires a fair amount of patience to get fimiliar with the game. But in the end it is worth it.\nbuy this game m9 u'll have a gr9 time i r9 9/9 dont h9","July 8, 2015","true","215.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

Weakness should be introduced in a way that doesn't make the game take literally 10 times as long, such as enemies being able to beat your face in harder; not by forcing me to kite each stupid guy around a room for 30 seconds while I'm yawning.\n\nBosses are even worse as they might take several minutes when you're a weak peice of crap. A lot of them this doesn't even make harder. It makes them a grind. You will be doing the same stupid predictible dodging pattern on a boss for about 6 years and falling asleep until you lose concentration out of boredom. A challenge is fun, but a 'challenge' that makes me spend disgusting amounts of time walking around a room basically invincible is not fun. Not all bosses are easy like that, but that doesn't make it any more fun dodging the same attack for 3 minutes while throwing ping pong balls.\n\nHard runs like this also often force you to slam your face against slot machines all day. Ugh....\n\nIntroduce a challenge that isn't about wasting time and gross repitition.\n\nGRINDING\nThough a recurring element elsewhere, this is mostly about donation machines. You can put pennies into donation machines that are usually just in stores for the benefit of upgrades and bonuses that is persistent through runs. This is fun! But wait...\n\nHaving a big money run and ready to spend that juicystack of 99 pennies in the donation machine? Well there is a chance that the machine jams for no reason. Congrats - you just donated like 3 pennies and now can't donate until the next run.\n\nThis is especially bad in greed mode where you can't even donate until the end of the game. Not only is it tough to have pennies left by the end of greed mode, the last boss makes you drop pennies when hit. This is all pretty okay. The real problem is that the greed machine, once it's at a pretty good donation rate, has up to 20% chance of jamming. Trying to get 999 pennies in there to unlock the extra character? Well I hope you like beating the whole game for the chance to insert a whole penny :-) thanks for the grind. I like when games are about grinding and luck instead of skill so this is great for me.\n\nContinued in comments.","February 29","true","200.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","5"

You've got the solid experience of the first game, but with so much more content and fine tuning, it's amazing. Firstly, its a miracle it runs on this laptop. Secondly, the synergies are amazing. Items interact with eachother in ways you never could have imagined seeing in the first game, and remember each of these unique synergies must have been coded in manually. Adds so much more replayability. New characters add to this, they are fairly unique. New bosses, new enemies, new aesthetic, new items, new rooms. Love the addition of more pathways than just The Chest and Sheol, now you can go to The Dark Room and fight MEGA SATAN! Also like the tracking system on the char menu as to which feats you have achieved with which characters and the addition of a normal/hard mode of the game. The new tear modifiers are very unique and introduce shots that would have been unimaginable in the first game. Tiny Planet (shots orbit around you), Monstro's Lung (you can do a monstro shot) as well as Ludovico technique (controllable mega tear) all synergise amazingly with different items. There is also the feeling of discovery. What does this item do? The slow realisation (or not in some cases) as to what some items gives you a level of satisfaction that is unparalleled by most other games. You can choose to play strategically, min/max every part of the game, or just go out have fun, or maybe you're a speedrunners and you're going to go for the Boss Rush after fighting Mom. Its a game anyone can enjoy. Nothing better than the feeling of being an absolute glass cannon and 2 shotting mom's heart\n\nGreat game overall, will find myself playing this for a very long time.\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nNext day, find out about 'whitetextures' opt in beta to fix the white rebirth glitch and yes it works!\nTime to play some rebirth.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nNew patch...

Everybody loves Isaac.\n\nThis is the most well-crafted game ever made. Period. What may look simple on the outside is actually the most complex game structure and system I have ever dealt with. You will be peeling back layers for easily 50+ hours, if not more. This version is considered a ‘demake’ due to the pixelated graphics, but is nothing short of bigger and better than the original in every possible way.\n\nMany people, including myself, have complained that the music is inferior to the original BoI. This is true… Sort of. The original BoI soundtrack by the infamous Danny B was an epic rock ballad where Rebirth brings a lot of creepy ambience with just the right amount of adrenaline pumping rock. It took me about 15 hours of play time before I decided I think I actually prefer the music and sounds in Rebirth overall. It is tough to decide between two things when both are great ;)\n\nNow I will get a little heavy. Let us discuss the system. Anyone playing Isaac (either BoI or Rebirth) for the first time has < ~5% chance of finishing the game on any given run. The game rewards knowledge. You play the game, you learn the monsters and items, and you will begin winning. It takes time. A lot of time. Knowledge is power – don’t forget that. For example, after 350 hours total for both games, I can usually win on every other run.\n\nThe metagame. I believe the BoI was one of the first roguelikes to really push the metagame. Sure, every run is random, but there are permanent unlocks and story points that really create an addictive play experience.\n\nOverall, the story and witty dialogue and conversion of the ‘dungeon’ to a ‘basement’ create such an atmospheric, quirky experience that no one can resist. Only the uninitiated dare question what magic this game offers – they simply need to experience it for themselves. After gaming since the mid ‘80s, I hold this game only second to Minecraft as the best game of all time.\n\nIf you don’t have this – stop what you are doing and go get it now. You will not regret it.","November 12, 2014","true","210.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

Isaac kept to himself drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television. Life was simple and they were both happy. That was until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above...\n\nGameplay The Binding of Isaac must be one of steams most popular game out there. It's simply addictive and fun. With millions of items to collect and hundreds of secrets to discover, it's no wonder that The Binding of Isaac is so popular. The game is a Rouge-Lite game and is kind of a parody on the old The Legend of Zelda games. Rouge-Lite indicates that if you die, it's game over and you can start all over again. This gives The Binding of Isaac an addictive nature, it makes you say to yourself: This time I will make it to the end. But we are talking about The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth now, which is a remake of the lovable The Binding of Isaac. But for those who are wondering: Yes, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a very fun game.\n\nRebirth The first thing you'll notice are the new pixelated graphics of Rebirth. The new graphics give a real professional feel to the game, while the last game was made using the flash engine. Rebirth has tons of new items, bosses, characters and secrets to discover. The only thing that I noticed right from the start, is that it all seemed so easy. This is because I've learned all its tricks in the previous game, and the real: "fail and learn" feeling, was kind of lost. Which made the previous game so addictive. But for the people who have never played the original, the feeling is not lost.\n\nConclusion The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is an amazingly fun game. With lots of secrets to discover, you could put thousands of hours into this game. But if you have played the original, these numbers might go down a bit. Hardcore fans of the original will love this game, and so will newcomers. The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a must own.\n\n9.5/10","November 16, 2014","true","18.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

Everything, from my mother trying to sacrifice me to the lord, to my battle with Satan, was somehow seen by Edmund McMillen. And though I sometimes wonder how, I remind myself that there is no way Edmund McMillen could have been watching me when I was a kid, based on my knowing about his life, and based on me living across the Pacific Ocean.\n\nHe couldn’t have been watching.\n\nHowever he found out, I am so grateful. Nobody believed my story when I reappeared at school years later. I even had mom’s body to prove it. Plus I was malnourished and covered in poo. The authorities said that she was killed when a large Bible fell on her head, and that was that; though I said I KILLED HER. And they just laughed at me. They wouldn’t even investigate the trap door to the underworld I REPEATEDLY told them about. They told me that I needed to see what I now know is a child psychiatrist. I will hate them till the Sun dies.\n\nBecause he’s a great games designer, a trip into my childhood doesn’t last years. If you survive like I did, it lasts about an hour. McMillen understands that games shouldn’t be too realistic. I mean, if THIS game were realistic, then you would feel never-ending sadness, dehydration, nightmares, and boss battles.\n\nI think, actually, that it’s important that he made it fun. If the game felt like what my experience really really felt like, then no one would want to finish playing my story. Only the really sad people.\n\nI’m too filled with emotion to write much more. I feel so honored by the existence of Rebirth. And though I know that playing this game may unleash more memories I’ve repressed, and though the improved graphics and sounds will make it more vivid, I know that I won’t get PTSD. I am so glad. Can't wait to play this during the Christmas holidays. I have no family because they are dead.\n\n20/10","November 4, 2014","true","111.6"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","11","19","0","0"

So don't take it lightly when I say the following:\n\nThis is one of the absolute all time top 10 best games I have ever played in over 30 years of gaming.\n\nI already had over 200 hours clocked in on the original game, so I was afraid I'd be burned out on Isaac. But Rebirth is simply phenomenal. It takes everything that was great about the original game, fixes almost everything that needed to be fixed from the original, and adds a crap ton more awesomeness on top on that. And then there's the complete graphics overhaul. I admit, I initially hated the idea of the game being changed to a 16-bit style. Why decrease the graphics quality? But it's so incredibly well done that I'm forced to admit, I was wrong. The game looks substantially better this way.\n\nIf I have one complaint, it's the music. It's not bad by any means. I just don't think it's as good as the original music, and it's a shame that, for what I assume are legal reasons, they couldn't use any of the original tracks.\n\nLong story short, if you have the money to spare, and you're thinking of buying a game, buy this game. I can't recommend it enough.","December 30, 2014","true","372.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

He hides in the basement and finds a variety of strange foes attacking him. Armed with only your tears and a glimmer of hope you must traverse these dangerous paths alone.

The game runs faster, as a result of being moved from the Flash engine to something a little bit less jank. The art is beautiful, even though I'm not exactly the biggest fan of pixel graphics. And, if you want something that looks a little more like the original game, there's a filter that does its best to smooth out the pixels to make something that looks just a little like the art of the first Binding of Isaac. Of course, the amount of items is mind-boggling, and they interact in sometimes hilarious and extremely effective ways. Brimstone gives you the ability to charge up a laser of blood vomit, and, when mixed with the Spoon Bender ability, the stream of blood turns bright purple and adjusts its flow to attack every enemy in the room.\nUnfortunately, Mr. Danny B. does not reprise his role as the composer. The music is still undeniably excellent, but simply doesn't compare to the soundtrack of the original game, which I find myself whistiling and humming to this day.\n\nIn case you want to skip right to what I really think: This game's great.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazedGunman27/recommended/250900/","CrazedGunman27","A Crazed Gunman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazedGunman27/","106 products in account","The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a remake of the Binding of Isaac made in 2011. The remake features several changes of the original game while implementing some additional features such as items, characters, rooms, enemies, and many more. In this game the player plays as a young boy named Isaac who is being pursued by his mother who's attempting to sacrifice him as an act of obedience to God. The gameplay is a two dimensional roguelike/dungeon crawler with the objective of descending to the next floor while staying alive and traversing through obstacles and monsters. The player starts with tears as their starting weapon which can be upgraded further into more powerful weapons (lasers, homing tears, etc)\n\nAs the title says, the game itself is a reference to a biblical story of the same name and contains a lot of biblical references in the game's contents (the bosses such as Duke of Flies or 7 deadly sins; the player characters are named after biblical figures, for example Cain, Judas and Eve; or the items like the Book of Revelations and Holy Grails).\n\nI have to say this is one of the best dungeon crawling game I've played because of how the game is flawlessly created.\nThe good aspects of this game are:\n+HUGE AMOUNT OF NEW FEATURES. Bosses! Items! Challenges! Everything you could ever ask for came in one package! This is what a remake should be.\n\n+NO RUNS WOULD EVER BE THE SAME. Thanks to seed-based map, every runs would be different and you might get the items you wanted, or get the items you never wanted, or encountering a boss that makes you want to hold the R button (I'm looking at you Haunt)\n\n+ITEM SYNERGIES. Through luck and general knowledge you can combine several items to create powerful and one could even say unfair effects to the player character. For example one's character can fire homing lasers, spitting several bombs while being invulnerable to explosive damages, or being an unstoppable juggernaut with wings that can destroy rocks by simply flying through them\n\n+SEVERE CONSEQUENCES ON THE PLAYER'S DECISIONS. Hmmm? should I sacrifice my last 2 heart containers for a Brimstone? or should I risk my last heart to get inside the curse room hoping to get a good item or black hearts? or maaybe I can combine Epic Fetus with Soy Milk, what could go wrong anyway? The wrong decision can ruin a run that is supposed to have 100% chance of winning\n\n+IMPROVED ART DESIGN. At first I was slightly skeptical about the developer's decision of transforming the game's visual into pixelated art-style since many indie games these days claimed to have Metal-Slug-tier art style while in reality it's just colorful pixel covered with eye-gouging filters and lens-flare. Boy I was wrong, horribly wrong. Even though I won't say that the pixel art is as good as Metal Slug, the developer has put its concern on the art-style of the game. Every objects are beautifully detailed to the last pixel\n\n+DIFFICULT, IN A GOOD WAY. The game is carefully designed so that when you thought that you have known everything and killed It Lives several times, suddenly the game introduces you to hidden stages and after beating said hidden stages the game shows you some even more hidden stages with even more ridiculous bosses! The difficulty is not about adding bullet sponges to curb your progress, but the game gives you difficulty based on your current progress. If you can't beat Mom's Heart, then the game is still pretty forgiving, However once you reach the Chest or Dark Room, every single steps taken will make you think twice, if not thrice on your actions.\n\nWell no matter how good the game is, there are always flaws in them. The bad aspects of this game are:\n-HEAVILY LUCK-BASED. just pray to RNGesus that the game will give you seeds with good items\n\n-NO MORE SEED EXPLOIT. man, I'm gonna miss getting all those achievements with ease","December 19, 2014","true","57.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Then you're in the same predicament I was in, before I got to play it on a friend's PS4. Previously, I have always been playing this game alone. I had no idea The Binding Of Isaac would be so much fun to play with friends! The new game honestly rekindled my love for Isaac and his unfortunate little friends, so I bought it on Steam the very next day.\n\nSome may think Rebirth is just a pricy expansion. To those I say; this game is worth getting, if only for the fact that it doesn't run in flash. The gameplay is super smooth and the pixel graphics are refreshing in ways that compliment the game like the first one never could. There's more playable characters, items, enemies, bosses, secrets, interactive stuff, and maps with rooms that come in variable sizes (not to mention achievements). Regardless, the gameplay remains to be trusty. Personally, it made me appreciate the game even more when I saw how the graphics were true to the familiar visuals of the original Binding Of Isaac. This time though, the menu comes with file select, challenges, and several other options which the first game didn't offer. If I should mention one downside, it would have to be small. The quirky music and sound effects of the first game were replaced with something else. They're still really awesome though!","December 22, 2014","true","8.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth contains the most chalenging fun & replayability in a game that I have ever experienced.  With added local co-op functionallity, increased powerups, new bosses, more levels, and added characters; it ranks up there as one of the best remakes I can remember.  Do yourself a favor, and if you like rogue like dungeon crawlers, pick this game up.","November 6, 2014","true","33.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is just a completely new experience and i myself liked it alot. Also, alot of ambience has been added to the game, especially in the womb and in the depths. Also the main enemies of the game have been made a little easier and the bosses slightly tougher, which makes the game more balanced when comparing small enemies to bosses. +1\n\nThe only bad thing about this game is that it doesnt have the original 'feel' of the binding of isaac. This game feels much colder and rushier.\n\nOveral I really enjoyed my first hours of playing and i would definitely recommend it to anyone whos out there looking for a tough but fresh game!","November 4, 2014","true","73.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Where do I start.\nWith endless hours of replayability this game will become one of your favorites. New Bosses, Items, Secrets there is so much to talk about. From killing spiders to crying on your own mother this is like the gta for Rogue-Likes. The first game was marvelous and I'm glad to see the creator (Edmund) and his team make a fantastic new remake. The community has grown with the making of this game and I'm glad it has because the first one needed much more attention than it should have had. The game has great graphics... Ok maybe it has 16-bit graphics but that is based on the art style you like (I like it), you will also be very satisfied after you beat something you've been trying to do for a long time!

And I really love the first one, I loved (i still do, kinda) with a burning passion.\n\n+An almost infinite combination of items and a thousand sinergies with the items within the game, and more to come.\n+Has the original content, including the content from the DLC.\n+Characters are unique and all have different ways of playing\n+A lot of items to unlock on the way to heaven or hell with each character.\n+Has local co-op (I played this with my 10 year old sister and later on with my girlfriend, it's a lot of fun!)\n+It stands between the fine line of fun and aggravation\n+It imposes a challenge for those who are looking for one with character "The Lost"\n+Good soundtrack with alternate tracks for rooms full of enemies. (I still miss some songs like the cellar, the caves and necropolis)\n+Rewards speedrunners with a special boss room\n+Challenges that are fun and some really tough\n+References to pop, internet and videogame culture everywhere.\n+A LOT more sinergies than in the previous game\n+Good graphics and very well optimized: won't lag much unless you're playing on a piece of stone\n\n-Needs online co-op (I'm sure if Metal Slug could this game absolutely can as well)\n-Needs option for turning off the womb "blood cell" filter, which always makes me dizzy and slows my game down\n-It's screaming for mod support (this may be subject to change in the upcoming dlc)\n-Needs some extra levels (the game is already long but I'm sure some people are asking for a HARDER floor (chest/dark room is hard, but once you got an overpowered run you chomp through it)\n-BIGGEST DOWNSIDE: Leaves you without a social life, really, I could have gone to the Gym, studied or gotten a job.\n\nNo regrets though, this game brings so much fun into my life, it makes me analize every aspect and think about desition making. (Don't wanna grab something that ruins your perfect sinergy like Ipecac and the Mirror)\n\n\n\n10/10 would spend another 150 hours","February 25, 2015","true","202.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

All the enemies have been remastered with sprites and more baddies have been included. Everything that was in the Wrath of the Lamb DLC is in this game with more items!\n\nThere are so many randomized rooms and enemies that each playthrough feel fresh. The controls are smooth and if you get hurt it's definitely your fault.\n\nThe difficulty curve is ridiculous, but once you understand how to find hidden rooms and remember what specific items do, you'll get the hang of it.\n\nThe story of Binding of Isaac outside the Prologue is vague, don't expect to get anything solid.\n\nI tried playing co-op with my girlfriend but managing health between each other and keeping track of enemies/players on screen was too difficult. This is definitely a single player game.\n\nBinding of Isaac is great and I'm more than happy to replay it over and over again.\nIf you're looking to get through the game quick, use Azazel.","January 1, 2015","true","67.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
