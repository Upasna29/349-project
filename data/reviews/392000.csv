"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pxabstraction/recommended/392000/","pxabstraction","Parallax Abstraction","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pxabstraction/","985 products in account","I also covered this game on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo-XbNxd7uU\n\nThis game has a cool core idea but also feels like some kind of twisted marketing experiment by Disney to see what players would let them get away with. It's shallow, it's buggy and it's full of microtransaction scumminess that would barely be acceptable in a free-to-play game but is in full force in one that costs a minimum of $20.\n\nThe basic idea is cool. It's a score attack runner game that has two modes, one on foot and one in light cycles. Each mode has their own levels, mechanics and challenges and despite a lacking sense of speed, everything feels fluid, responsive and it's actually quite fun. Though there are only 16 levels for each mode, plus a randomly generated endless mode where you race for time instead of score, you're encouraged to replay levels for better scores and there can be a decent number of hours involved in completing everything if that's your thing.\n\nWhere this completely breaks down is with the powerups and the microtransactions tied to them. Yes, this is a minimum $20 game that has microtransactions. Now, they're very much optional and grinding out in-game currency to buy powerups actually doesn't take that long. That said, the powerups are single use so you might have to grind a lot. Where this falls apart is YOU CAN BUY POWER! There are powerups that will both double your combo accumulation AND double your score! You can literally buy higher scores on the leaderboards. This completely renders the core competitive loop of this game worthless as it's not a level playing field and those willing to grind or spend money do better by default. For that reason alone, you shouldn't buy this game. This is a business model that deserves to fail.\n\nThe game looks very good and nails the TRON aesthetic but the PC version is a mess. You can only quit the game by pressing ESC on the title screen, something not documented anywhere. You can't rebind any of the controls. There are UI glitches, especially in the Stream endless mode. Load times are long, even on high-end machines and as of writing, the leaderboards which you can buy your way up on don't even work! Every time I try to bring them up, it sits at Loading and never shows anything.\n\nThere's a great TRON-inspired idea here but the game is buggy, overpriced for what you get and the microtransaction strategy ruins it. I'd expect this in a free-to-play mobile game, not a $20 PC release. Such potential wasted. DON'T BUY THIS!","February 18","false","6.1"," 351 of 401 people (88%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","88","351","401","12","10"

But here I am, complaining that I can't reconfigure the keyboard controls. And while the game is pretty looking, it's completely reptitive. If you like games that are more about memorizing patterns than strategic gameplay, this is good for you. But if you're looking for any kind of variety, you're out of luck. The game also seems to be nothing but a front for a pay-to-win cash store. No difficulty mode, and very hard for a casual gamer. After two hours of play, I didn't manage to complete a single mission, and I'm hardly the worst gamer ever. I knew this wasn't going to be Tron 2.0, but I didn't expect the light-cycle equilivant of bullet hell. Coming out when this did, one assumes the makers were hoping that more Tron content would help revitalize interest in the franchise, but all it really does is represent a final nail in the coffin.","April 17","false","1.2"," 114 of 140 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","114","140","4","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ultanium/recommended/392000/","ultanium","Ult","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ultanium/","409 products in account","Previously recommended during the early access period. This game had a ton of potential during the 2-3 months of early access. The developer picked up on some of the community requested features and tried their best to implement as much as they possibly could. Unfortunately, I now see that a lot of those community ideas were instead used to generate cash grab opportunities for Disney. I won't hold this against Sanzaru Games as they have done an incredible job nailing the look and feel of this universe. Everything else is politics on Disney's end.\n\nPositive Impressions\n-Gameplay is solid. No input delay. Run, jump, glide, slide, wall run, attack, Tony Hawk 360 skatepark and light cycle your way to the finish. Supports keyboard + mouse and controller.\n-Visually a very beautiful game and manages to capture the neon-glow vibrance of the TRON universe. Colour palette is buffed slightly from TRON: Evolution.\n-Soundtrack is solid and adds a level of depth and dramatic feel to the whole experience.\n-Steam achievements for the 100% go-getter.\n\nNegative Impressions\n-No tangible story or anything of substance to back some sort of continuity for the player. I realise this may not be a necessary feature for most runner games, but the desire to progress slowly deteriorates as repetiveness takes over soon after the first few missions (with the exception of boss encounters). The currently available 32 levels becomes a chore rather than an exhilerating journey with a justifiable cause to progress.\n-Leaderboard is forever loading. This game is far from a 'finished' product.\n-I previously reported randomly losing health and hero suddenly turning invisible during the running segments whilst under early access. I continue to experience these bugs.\n-Performance issues continue to persist since day one of early access despite numerous reviewers and members of the community being vocal about stability issues. Some bugs (like those mentioned above) and frame rate issues continue to persist.\n-Light cycle segments are an absolute drag. The developers should have focused solely on the running segments with newer and more intuitive features. The light cycle portions just don't feel right at all.\n-Main menu? What main menu. There is no such thing here! No options menu unless you hit escape, and no way to exit the game unless you return to the very top menu and hit escape.\n-The base game will set you back by £14.99 and an optional £19.00 for the ultimate upgrade. That totals to £33.99. Slightly overzealous, don't you think Disney? I purchased this during early access and splashed £6.99. THAT should be the price for the current content available in the base game alone. Everything else is a perfect opportunity for Disney to slag off the TRON and Steam community. Your money is best invested elsewhere.\n\nHad I known this would be the embarrasing route Disney originally intented I would have avoided RUN/r right from the beginning. Yes, I am in love with the TRON universe and yes I did purchase this with little knowledge. However, I had no regrets at the time even with the bare bones content. I wanted to support this project and was satisfied with the content I saw and the expectations bouncing between the community. From here onwards I will be extremely vigilant towards all future entries in this universe, especially anything baring the Disney label.","February 21","false","6.1"," 53 of 68 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","53","68","2","2"

I actually had to go find You Tube footage of numerous endless runner type games so that I could make the same comparison that others (who seemingly have never played this) are making about the game. I can say for certain that this IS NOT LIKE ANY ENDLESS RUNNER AT ALL. The fact that you are running is about the only comparison I could find. Endless runners that I have seen dont have or let you :\n\na) Double jump into a flying mode\nb) Wall run\nc) Manilpulate the existance of platforms\nd) Destroy the enviroment\ne) Engage and destroy enemies\nf) Ninja dodge\ng) Ride awesome light cycles and do freestyle tricks with them\nh) etc. etc. etc.\n\nI could go on and on about how this IS NOT LIKE ANY ENDLESS RUNNER AT ALL, but if you still want to believe it after what you just read , then I can't help you.\nTo the rest of you, here is an amazing Tron game with a great pricetag!\nI like games that I can get in and out of and test my reflexes within a matter of minutes, e.g- "Race the Sun, Spelunky, Nidhog" and this scratched that itch perfectly. Amazing levels with great artstyle true to the "TRON" universe. Great disc upgrading and perk systems and fast and precise platform style running gameplay. When I got into serious sessions with this game (albeit with the Daft Punk blasting) I would finish the levels feeling ultra powerful, highly skilled, and generally vibrating with excitment.\nGreat little game and totally worth of the price!","April 3","true","1.6"," 57 of 82 people (70%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","70","57","82","15","6"

With that said it is pretty enjoyable and well done, this is a pretty solid endless runner with your typical endless runner abilities like sliding, wall running and gliding. All in all, It controls well (I used a Xbox controller) and looks fantastic, the art direction really hits the cool neon cyberspace look of the Tron franchise.\n\nAs you play you can collect the game's ingame currency called light (I think) which can then be used to purchase buffs and powerups which can then be used in each of the game's levels, abilities such as being able to improve your power disc attacks and/or the ability to automatically collect light that is nearby. Most of these are very similar to those found in mobile endless runners.\n\nFor those interested I would still hold off until more content is available but here is hoping that said content is released in a timely fashion.\n","December 3, 2015","true","0.3"," 74 of 127 people (58%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","58","74","127","6","5"

It's not just a runner clone with a pretty skin.\n\nThe game seemed to have been made under a very short deadline, but compared to early access games that have never fully released under two months, there is very little bugs and performance wise will work on most computers.\n\nAs a super TRON fan, taking in consideration that Disney basically canned the upcoming TRON sequel and the very underrated TV show, we were lucky to even get something TRON related, especially a very fun runner game. It may not have been what everyone wanted, but it is something that everyone could try. Multiplayer is being taken into consideration anyway, so hopefully that brings more people to play this game.\n\nI've supported the game since it's initial early access release, so overall I give it a 7.5/10.","March 5","true","35.5"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","18","26","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vaelsh/recommended/392000/","vaelsh","Vaelsh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vaelsh/","450 products in account","First of all, this game is an absolute BEAUTY to behold! The environments are fantastic and really makes you feel like you are a program trying to get to the portal and escape from the Grid. Also, the effects and lighting that's used is perfect and it makes the Grid come alive!\n\nThe object of the game is to get to the portal. In the disc mode, this means running along, jumping and sliding, dodging attacks, throwing your disc, wall running, gliding, and even grinding on rails to get to the end in one piece. You have 3 energy (health points). If you lose all your energy, you lose. The controls handle great for this mode and it's easy to get into and learn but tricky to master especially when you're running quickly and trying to deal with everything in front of you.\n\nThe second mode is the light cycle mode and it's also a lot of fun, but very challenging. The reason it's so challenging and brutal is that you have to get to the end before the time runs out, but the catch is that you have to go through check point gates to keep the time up. The gates will have different second amounts they will add such as 2, 4, and 6 seconds. If you run out of time, you lose. This mode is tough, and it really is a try, try, and try again until beat it sort of mode.\n\nThe third mode is "STREAM" which is basically an endless randomly generated run which can switch between disc and cycle modes to keep you on your toes. It is a lot of fun and is great to come to and play if you need a break from the other two modes because instead of being pre-made like the others, it's all random as it goes. Also worth mentioning, is that this mode has a weekly challenge you can do. For example, it will ask you to survive for 1:50. This will award you for example with a badge (which I still haven't figured out what it does). Overall a lot of fun! I will be playing this mode a lot I think.\n\nIf you buy the Season Pass, you will be given a TON of new characters to play as, many new light cycles to choose from, and also an Outlands mode will appear. I still haven't been able to play this mode but it might just be a bug that needs to be fixed. The new characters and light cycles you can use include all the cycles and characters (almost) from the original TRON, TRON: Legacy, and even very surprisingly, TRON: Uprising. They are all recreated in fantastic detail and really come to life in the game.\n\nNow for some information on how the in-game currency system works and how to get it. When you play a level in either the disc or cycle mode, all of the gold/yellow bits you gathered will be given to you as a reward for completing the level. If you don't finish the level, you don't get any of it. However, the endless mode will give you any bits aquired while in the run and you can use this to get more fairly quickly. It's quite easy to get a reasonable amount of bits by just playing the endless mode. These bits in turn allow you to purchase powerups and companions for a run. Powerups are useable items that can be activated at any time, while the companions are passive abilities like attacking enemies or drawing in nearby bits passively. Each run you can equip one of each of these. The companions are fragile however; if you get hit once, it disappears.\n\nOverall, I am having a blast with the game and it's awesome. If you love TRON, runner games, or racing types of games, or even all of the above, you'll love it. Good luck program!\n\nUpdate: It looks like the DLC such as the different cycles and characters along with additional levels have been pulled because it was prematurely released when it was still being tested. It sounds like that content will be released over time like a normal season pass works.","February 17","true","4.3"," 41 of 71 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","41","71","3","3"

All of them are quite enjoyable and worth a go. Optimization and responsiveness seem good, no issues whatsoever on my system. Only a few minor grpahical quirks have been seen, some of which were recently corrected in the latest patch. A very casual twitch game hus far, with YMMV replayability. I find it quite fun.\n\nWhat this game needs IMNSHO is a DIsk battle arena (Disk Wars) such as we saw in Legacy. Some game mode with a greater control over our character could not hurt either.\n\nWhile the design and layout of the hand-created levels is quite nice, over time they may become stale. I would like to see the building blocks of these levels used for some kind of procedural level generation, or an endless runner mode (or both).\n\nThe core of this game is there, and quite promising. As of yet we have no idea how much more will be added, but more of the same is certainly not unreasable to expect. The low cost of entry makes this easy to recommend based on the current state and the forthcoming potential.","January 31","true","7.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I really suck at "Twitch" type games in general, but this one is managable and a lot of fun. There are currently only 3 playable levels that introduce the different skills needed to play the game.\n\nLevel 1 is mostly jumping and throwing your disk.\nLevel 2 introduces wall running.\nLevel 3 introduces sliding and is the most challanging of the levels so far.\n\nAt the end of the level, you recieve a score that is based on how many "Bits" you pick up, how many hits you have remaining as well as other stuff im not sure about. :)\n\nI use the keyboard and the mouse and the controls are excellent. (Rare for this type of game) and I have no problem with doing all the functions the game requires.\n\nThere are power ups you can purchase with points you get from completed levels, but so far with some exceptions I dont know exactly what most of them do. As this is in early beta, I am hoping that they add explanations to them to explain what they do later on down the road.\n\nOnce you get the hang of things, you can complete whats in the game now in about 15 minutes give or take. I am hoping they add new levels soon as I have already played the 3 missions in the game a lot of times and i am ready for more.\n\nSummary:\n\nThis game is a lot of fun, I have already racked up 3 hours playing it and there really isnt much content yet so the groundwork for an excellent game is definetly there. If you are leary about "Twitch" games, (Hey, Im 51 years old and typically suck at twitch style games) give this one a shot and I think you will be pleasently suprised. I am sure the developers will jack up the price of the game as they get closer to completion, so get it while its cheap as I think this game will be a keeper.\n\nAccording to what I am reading, they will have Light cycles soon....so that should be a hoot as well.\n\n","December 8, 2015","true","12.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Reliant39/recommended/392000/","Reliant39","Reliant39","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Reliant39/","701 products in account","This is an excellent endless runner set in the TRON universe, with visuals inspired by the last TRON movie, TRON: Evolution, and the TRON: Uprising TV-series, though DLC characters will be made available soon from the original TRON movie. It has everything you would want from an endless runner, including two different "campaigns" of sorts consisting of 16 levels each. In the first, Disc mode, you run through a particular track towards the finish, gaining points along the way and trying to get a three-star rating. In Cycle mode, you basically do the same thing, but using a light cycle. A third mode is Stream, which is classic endless running, where you will also switch between walking on foot to driving a light cycle and vice versa.\n\nThe difficulty ramps up nicely as you play through the various modes. You have to run and jump along the track, slide underneath obstacles, run along walls, grind on rails, and defeat enemies using your disc. Enemies are either other standing programs (sometimes deployed via Recognizer) or moving grid bugs. Sometimes, a light tank will pop up and you have limited time to defeat it before getting damaged yourself. You can buy special abilities and helper programs to make life a little easier, using a currency consisting of bits (you get an ample supply of these when you buy the game and more are earned by simply playing the game).\n\nGraphically, the game looks really nice, running on Unreal Engine 4. Everything has an electronic glow like you would expect and the surfaces are hard and reflective. In motion, it looks even more fantastic. Gameplay is solid. I have only played the game using an XBox 360 controller and I think that's probably the preferred way to play it. If there is one problem, it's that the game currently doesn't have a Quit option: you have to hit Escape on the keyboard on the title screen to quit the game, which strikes me as a curious oversight.","February 22","true","2.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

What this game Really needs is a config option that will allow all of us PC users to set up how graphic quality you want to use for the game to function better on whatever model PC you use, and for control set up for what keys anyone would like to use to make their gameplay experience more comfortable and enjoyable in the game.  other than that, this is an ok game its not that bad.

For those who can't figure out what exactly it is, it's a runner game. Not endless runner, levels have definitive beginnings and endings, right now there are only 3. You can add upgrades to your character to help out in the levels. It's basic but pretty fun. With more levels in the future (and they are planning to add more and light cycles) it can become a great game\n\ncons\n-no achievment descriptions\n-can't remap keys, alt is a very awkward key to press for wall running\n-no graphical settings at all\n\ndespite that though I still find it enjoyable.

Geeking out over a good looking Tron game, I had to get this one. The game so far (light on content, its early access so understandable) is amazing. Graphics and overall theme is great, has a wonderful Tron vibe going on. I do hope they improve on the sound, needs more of a electronic/techno edge to it.\n\nGameplay is easy, and what I mean by that is that they ease you into the game. I appreciate that being an old fart gamer that isnt the best and run and twitch games. The fighting element is a great twist along with the upgrades.\n\nOverall I am pumped about this game and very excited for that they will come out with. The current cost is a bit much (9.99) but once they release more content it will be a bargain. If you are into Tron pickup this game. Even if you arent all that into runners this game will be fun for any Tron fan. Its not a mobile port you can tell this was made for the PC with some good old Tron lovin.","December 4, 2015","true","1.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Currently there is one mode available entitled "Disc" with three levels accessible.  You play an unknown program fleeing the system.  This is a runner style game where you follow a prearranged set path with your movement limited to:  left/right, duck, jump and are unable to speed up or slow down.\n\nA number of powerups are available at the start of each level that you can purchase using energy bytes that you earn in game.  This allows you to customize your character with various power-ups and companions that can affect how you play a level.\n\nThe visuals in the game are remarkable and harken back to the look of Tron 2.0 (a great fps if you haven't played) combined with the character designs from the newer Tron Evolution game.  It is also amusing to see the devs giving nods to the source material when you rack up an "MCP Combo" or "Space Paranoid" combo to name a few.\n\nAll in all a fun little game that challenges you to keep playing in order to beat your previous scores and earn the 3 Light Bytes (aka gold stars) per level.\n\nThe store page lists partial controller support.  I was able to play the game with no problem using an Xbox One controller.  In fact the in-game control options showed such a controller so that may be an indication that the devs plan to bring it to the Xbox One some time in the future.","December 5, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I would recommend this game to any fan of TRON just for the sake of it being a TRON game.\n\nPros\nWe got a new TRON game. Yay!\nWicked awesome soundtrack.\nThe gameplay is fun and pretty easy to learn for being a fast-paced game.\nAchievements!\nDid I mention we GOT A NEW TRON GAME?!\n\n\nCons\n$20, plus another 15 for the season pass or 25 for the Ultimate Upgrade.\nHas a "pay-to-win" feel to it with microtransactions to buy bits to buy the upgrades.\nNo story as far as I can tell. The Grid voice says things like "The MCP has lost the target," when you finish a level, so it sounds kind of like early ideas of what TRON 3 might have been, the renewal of the MCP from the 1982 movie, but in the updated Legacy Grid.\n\nPersonal Opinions\nThe Light Cycle levels are tough. I could do the first one completely fine but any level after I HAD to buy the companion upgrade to get more time for each hoop.\nLots of promising DLC with characters from the entire canon TRON universe.\n\nAll in all, I bought this to support my favourite Disney franchise in hopes that if it gets enough support, we might see more from TRON. I'd say if your a fan of the franchise as well, you should eventually pick it up, even if you have to wait for it to be on sale.

Above all what I like best is the ability to challenge your friends (not playing together of course) to see if they can beat your or their scores.","April 16","true","6.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

The game has a solid sound track and excellent art design. It plays best with a controller but the controls are nice and responsive. There are only 3 levels so far but they provide a nice challenge and never feels unfare.

If you want a much more content rich game, wait a few months, or at least wait till the light cycle update is released.\n\nOtherwise as of right now this game has a LOT of potential and whoever is backing this game is doing a fantastic job.

It has a sub-iPhone level of content, minimalist gameplay, and is probably just high of what could run on an iPhone as well. I have a suspicion that this was originally developed for mobile and adapted for PC when they discovered that it would be just a bit too much for mobile to run.\n- Unreal 4's bad parts show as strongly as its good parts: textures will take their sweet time loading, in particular.\n- No graphics options. The game could really use them.\n- Random frame drops. I'm talking about baaaaaaad frame drops. Game ending frame drops. And they always happen in the same place.\n- Permeated by micro transactions. You can play without, just with only the default loadout.\n- Really easy. Insultingly easy, even.\n- They couldn't license the movie soundtrack. Enough said.\n\nMy entire experience playing this game was me staring at the screen not believing that anything from the Tron IP was released in 2016. But it's a far cry from what I really want in my life: which is, of course, another movie. Still worth it on sale for a Tron fan.","June 1","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not sure why some reviewers had issues with the fact it was a runner.  It literally has RUN/r in the name so one should know this before purchasing.\n\nOne thing to note is this game prefers up to date drivers.

I've seen some negative reviews of people who get the game expecting more. There's no story, there's no other modes.\n\nHaving said that, it is a decent running game. It's graphics and sounds are superior to most running games (which are often just phone app ports). And overall it captures the Tron asthetics well. The difficulty is on the higher side for running games which gives it some replayability as you master the dozens of levels.\n\nThe biggest con is the game is setup with a cash shop. You can get bits just from playing but the game will try to sell you bits for real money. Honestly I would suggest getting the Deluxe Edition; not only do you get all the DLC levels with it but you get 11,000 bits. (the deluxe is cheaper than buying the game + DLC and then the 11,000 bits on top of that is essentially free). With 11,000 bits + what you can earn in game you will be able to avoid the cash shop entirely.\n\nI picked the deluxe edition up on sale for under $20 and I feel like the game is worth around that.
