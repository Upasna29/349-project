It's super broken and glitchy, the buggiest game i've ever played.  In the event that you can figure out how to even start a game with the clunky and confusing UI you'll be confronted with a very frustrating and broken game.  You'll be lucky if the skybox and world and everything spawn, then you'll wait a few minutes for textures and ground clutter to pop in, finally you'll be able to actaully start playing.  The overall concept for the game is great but its poorly excecuted, as i mentioned earlier the UI is terrible,  if you can figure out how to order the units that may or may not spawn, they'll typically do something completely opposite.  I once ordered a group of soldiers to walk to a point right in front of them but the game gave them a path all the way around the outskirts of the map and back to the point.  This game also suffers from countless bugs, from the aformentioned failed spawning and pop in to things skipping about the map or dissapearing.  Units will also just completely ignore orders and stand around, of course that's no threat to them as the enemy AI is just as bad and will seldom attack you.  All in all this game will just frustrate you, save yourself the $10, i got it on sale for 50% off so i didn't lose too much.  Until some major patching and updating is done, stay away from gettysburg: Armored Warfare. Go play Starcraft: II or Command & Conquer instead.","November 25, 2013","false","0.2"," 93 of 108 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","93","108","3","0"

Imagine you're going to a paintball game, you're excited on the ride to the location. When you get to the venue, and the game of paintball starts, you realize no one is on your team, then you get pelted with rubber bullets. At this point, you're disappointed as all hell and want to get out. Then the venue disappears. You're free, and happy once more. Then you realize your money is still gone, and you go home beat to hell, incredibly disappointed.","July 2, 2014","false","0.5"," 67 of 80 people (84%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","84","67","80","8","0"

As a concept it's amazing... in execution it is severely lacking.  Graphics are mediocre, but the publisher has taken down the servers for multi-player.  The auto released the server code, so you could play it, but that doesn't make it worth it.\n\nIt's very hard to see where your bullets go when you play mini-gun infantry for one example, because your head blocks it all.  If your curious about this game, wait for another Steam Sale and hopefully get it for 99 cents or less.\n\nI didn't play it for more than about 20 minutes before I gave up on it.

But, this game is worth it. It deserves it. It is my duty.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\nPart 1\n\n\nAs soon as I saw this game was on sale, I bought it, despite the negative reviews. I knew it had to be more than that. Something was off about those negative reviews.\n\nUpon loading the game, I heard a whisper in my ear.\n"You are the chosen one, my son..."\n\n"God, is that you?"\n\n"No, my son, I am the spirit of Danny Green."\n\nI cautiously opened the game's credits from the main menu. They slowly began to scroll.\n\n\nProgramming: Danny Green... Graphics: Danny Green... Animation: Danny Green...\n\n"I've been trapped for years in this game, waiting for the chosen one to free me from the chains that EA has put me in. Those monsters were scared of indie developers and made me an example… Take the Holy Drink of RC Cola and save me… please my son, save me…"\n\nIt was my duty to save him. I had to save this grand celestial being known to the mortal world as Danny Green. He was an angel, a god, and a legend. He brought me into this world, now I must save him.\n\n\nI only had one choice. I got up from my desk chair and walked to my closet, where everything was laid out in case of an emergency such as this. Upon my head I carefully placed my red Obey™ Snapback. My Gunnar™ elites were set upon my nose, giving me 4/20 vision. I strapped on my fingerless h4XX1nG gloves, providing my tips with maximum n00b reking power. Upon my shoulders rested my leather bomber jacket, followed by football compressions shorts and pads hanging from my waist. I slid my feet into the enlighteningly-comfortable-yet-also-durable Nike™ Air Monarch sneakers. I was prepared for war.\n\nAs I left my room, I pulled my Red tiger Winchester™ Model 1873 from its display case.\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nPart 2\n\nAs I left my house in Redwood City, California, I didn't feel fear. I felt... fulfillment... I was serving my purpose on this earth for my master, Danny Green. I knew I would join him in Valhalla after this quest.\n\nI made my short trek to the EA Headquarters. It was time.\n\nI kicked in the door with the force of over 9000 steampunk gatling guns. My bullets showed no mercy the EA pigs. I heard the angles of Heaven cheer:\n\n"Get Noscoped scrub!!!!1"\n\n"Where u at m8?!"\n\n\nEvery EA member had been subdued into an enlightened state. I showed them mercy and did not splatter their blood on the walls for peace is the way of Danny Green. They were fulfilled. They had been converted.\n\nI walked up to a new 'Greenian'.\n\n"Would you mind opening the server room for me?"\n\nHe quickly opened the locked door with his key, acting faithfully upon his new beliefs. I walked in with my RC Cola Grenade in hand.\n\n"Got a little...  green ... with envy there, EA"\n\nI threw the grenade. The servers were destroyed. Danny Green was saved. All was right in the world.\n\nDanny Green is Love. Danny Green is Life.\n\n\n\n420/10 Would fullfill my destiny again.\n","December 25, 2014","true","0.5"," 77 of 126 people (61%) found this review helpful 87 people found this review funny","61","77","126","87","7"

It was 2012, right when Steam opened the floodgates and started letting everyone/forcing everyone to use their services/DRM, which allowed us all to sample/be overwhelmed, drowned and choked, by an almost infinite amount of indie/completely-horrible-unpolished-garbage games.    That's when it all went downhill, and the story of this game is the story of Steam.

It is seriously bad. There is no tutorial, you can jump straight into a match online or play offline practice. When you play offline, there are 2 modes. In one you get to construct an army with a point limit, each kind of unit worth different point values. When I spawned my army, they all died instantly. In the other mode units spawn automatically. Infantry are excruciatingly slow, cavalry are faster but have swords so are useless. Tanks kill everything. When you run over things (walls, trees) in a vehicle, they just disappear. And when i say run over things i mean when they come within 10 metres of the front of my tank.

Maybe he outsourced models or textures but Im not sure. If it was made by one guy its impressive but at the same time not really. AI is relatively basic, textures and models look okay but the art style doesn't seem to be a single style besides it all being wacky steampunk. Controls feel basic without much actual feel to them. Actual gameplay feels dull and emotionless which in a way is what this game is. Its also fairly buggy but you won't play it enough to know this unless your a raving lunatic. Its just not done. Thats pretty much it, bruv.\n\nI initially was very hyped for this game but when it came out it was a dissapointment.\n\nLast I checked this game was non-functioning as its main focus was online and no one played it because it sucks but mostly because the servers were down and were down for the forseeable future. Im not sure as to whether they are online now but I doubt the game has changed since I last played it so unlike other games I don't really feel the bother to install and try it. The dev blog or whatevers out there should be able to tell you if interested.\n\nStay away from this one is about the best thing you could do.","April 25, 2014","false","1.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It even displays the total amount of time you've spent on loading screens, which is pretty convenient when you ask yourself "Have I seriously been loading this game for 10 minutes?" No, actually you've been loading for 1359 seconds from launch to getting into your first game.\n\nThe gameplay is awful too. Units kind of just stand there and fall over once in a while when they feel like being dead. I watched three unmanned gattling guns forever missing eachother and that was the most action I saw. The third-person mode is kind of like I'd imagine mount & blade was in the first testing phases.\n\nThis could have been a very cool game but it seems like it suffered from lack of programming knowlege and being released far before it should have.","March 22, 2013","false","0.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

And yes, the game is very buggy and glitchy, but the game is still very fun and I do very much reccomend you get, even if you can only play against bots.\n\nPros:\n- Great concept (A futuristic era in which the Civil War is still being fought)\n- Large maps (9 KM x 9 KM which can create huge, intense and epic battles, especially if the ticket count is high)\n- Naval Combat (At first a little boring, but once a bunch of ships start fighting at once it's pretty cool)\n- The Civil War\n\nMeh/Average:\n- The Graphics (The textures are muddy but passible.)\n- Sound (Some of the sounds are actually good, like the echo of gunfire in the distance, but up close the guns sounds like toys)\n- Models (Some of the models are ok like the tank and modern artillery models, but the models of the\ntrees and fences are questionable.\n\nCons:\n- AI (Doesn't work most of the time, but works very well when it does)\n- Animations (A lot of the animations are underexaggerated from what they should be)\n- Health System (Honestly only the thing that really bugged me, all musket shots count as 25% damage no matter where you shoot your enemy.)\n\nOverrall I do reccomend this game is just want something that can boast very large battlefields and huge, insane battles. This game had a lot of potential. Unfortunatley the publisher, Paradox, had this title rushed out the door and didn't allow the dev to continue improving this game. I hope that in the future the dev can work on something similar to this, and take his own pace and make something great!\n","November 22, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What I really found good about this game is the realistic and non-forced representation of story. It is of a scientist who ponders over  what the civil war would have been like with 2060 technology. He travels back in time and brings with him all of his steam-punk 2060's  technology to alter the war the divided America. The story is not forced by cut-scene's or even narrative, it is in fact left to the playing to browse over to the games website and download the game's pdf instruction manual where the sneaky slip of story is finally revealed. This sense of mystery and adventure adds to the games already strong events and themes taking place of the time. But what I find most outstanding and most accomplishing is this games representation of the 1860's soldiers. They are SO set and focused on the strong task at hand, winning the war, that the existence of 2060's technology right next to them goes unnoticed. I'm absolutely certain that if we could place ourselves in the shoes of a 1860's soldier in this circumstance that we would truly understand the focus, but as of now, we just have to ponder. I'd be lying if I said this game was bad in anyway, and rightfully so, I give it the prestigious award of, 10/10.","April 2, 2013","true","3.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
