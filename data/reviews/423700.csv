This game allows to collect resources and build up the best hotel you can. The gameplay is very simplistic and (I'm 100% sure) it's build from the RPG maker base. Which isn't a bad thing since a lot of good games came from that software.\n\nThe story is simple, you're a survivor in a zombie apocalypse and you want to find your parents. Simple, solid and straight to the point. It sets up the groundwork for what it truly is, a hotel management and zombie survival game. It does both of these really well. A lot of the time, you'll be collecting resources by exploring around the area in order to upgrade your run-down hotel into a 5-star zombie resort.\n\nEverything about the game is simple. The gameplay is nothing really new or innovative. You run around and shoot stuff, collect stuff, and build stuff. It's building the hotel that gets you, and it's very addictive. I'm always one for Civ or SimCity, so I felt right at home here.\n\nOverall, get this if you want to try something new, and at a very reasonable price ($6.99 time of writing this). It's addictive and I can see there was effort put into this.","February 16","true","1.1"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","28","35","4","0"

You go off in search of them at the hotel, but alas they don’t appear to be there. So, in response to this, you’ve just decided to make the world’s first apocalyptic hotel.\n\nNow, before you say anything, I will just mention that I do understand that the game is built in RPG Maker, but that doesn’t make it any less of a good game. Whereas other games in the engine may not be quite up to par, Apocalypse Hotel, along with another one of the developers games built in this engine makes use of their own art assets. The inclusion of their own art assets makes the game so much more interesting to look at when it comes to the visuals, instead of being forced to look at the same grass patch you’ve seen in every rushed out RPG Maker game ever.\n\nOn top of the change in visuals, the developer has decided for something other than the typical turn-based combat you would see out of this engine. Instead, the dev has decided to go for action oriented combat that happens in real time. Everything in terms of combat will reveal itself to you the moment you load up the game. Zombies will wander around, you press a button to fire your weapon, and then their health bar drops. Keep doing that until said zombie is down and deceased; permanently! It has to be said, the combat is a nice change from the typical combat you would see from this engine.\n\nTo make the combat just that little bit interest, the developer opted in to add a companion system, with the first companion you come across being a zombie dog. And I tell you what, the moment you get that dog, it makes your day’s of zombie killing sooo much easier, that has to be said.\n\nAlthough, with the change of gameplay, the game does have a level up system for both you and your companions, all of which will level up depending on how much they’ve managed to take down. Levelling up is purely a buff for stats, however, and doesn’t require you to do anything once you’ve levelled up, as you will already have the buff added to the character whom had levelled. Each character in the game can also equip different weapons and items as well, even if they are an undead dog that follows you everywhere out of love and loyalty.\n\nVideo games that have the undead in don’t tend to have the best of of storylines, all due to it never really being a focus. Well, with this game the developer has put a little more thought into the story, and I would have to say it pays off. The gist of it: aliens land on Earth, they change the atmosphere to accommodate them, and the majority of humankind just kind of died and was revived as zombies. Initially the plot isn’t anything too special, but with each new piece of story I come across it really brings me to want to find out more about what’s going on in the world.\n\nApocalypse Hotel may center around you running a hotel, but that doesn’t mean you have to hang around there for the rest of your days. You will be expected to go out often and do quests, as well as finding new items and parts that you can make use of. Those parts you can use for a myriad of things, and not just around the hotel. You’re given the option to build new weapons, ammo, and fix up parts of the hotel to make it more desirable to potential guests.\n\nObviously, the main chunk of gameplay is keeping the hotel in check. Throughout the hotel you can make improvements all over the place, from restocking the bar, to building the most expensive room imaginable, only for the most prestigious of guests. Thankfully, those guests won’t be staying for free, so they will pay you a regular fee for staying each and every night. The price they are willing to pay will range between each and every guest, so be sure to keep an eye on new potential NPC’s, as they may just be looking to pay more than another individual. Some guests require special rooms, but they tend to be worth it. The reason being is that they will offer something a little more than just the typical fuel that you use for all sorts in the game, like travelling.\n\nGuests may be good for one thing, but they do need to be fed (unfortunately...). So, it is in your place as the hotelier to feed your guests. You can simply do that by going into the kitchen and making some hotel meals out of whatever you can find in the overridden city, but be careful; the more guests, the more mouths to feed, so be sure to keep that in mind.\n\nThe city you’re tasked to explore isn’t all empty, as at times you will come across quests that you’ve accumulated over time. These quests tend to range in difficulty, and for the most part will mention whether they’re easy, medium or hard to complete. Quests are your typical fetch jobs that you need to do, but they do end in a reward, so you can’t really complain.\n\nThese next few things are rather miscellaneous, but I felt that they deserved some mention. The game has a 24 hour day and night cycle, where every second in real life is a minute in-game, and depending on what time it is, your character will require a light when it is dark out. Trust me, when it’s dark out, you’re a little more reserved when it comes to going anywhere, as it is very difficult to tell where the next attack comes from if it’s not directly in front of you, and that’s just a little bit terrifying. Next up is shadows, and even though you won’t come across them too often, they still look pretty darn good when your character walks past the odd lamp.\n\nWith the time I’ve spent in the game I haven’t really come across too many problems so far, but there is one thing that does bug me, and that’s the sound effect you get to hear whenever you save the game. The sound effect is of a zombie growling in your ear, and every single time I hear it, regardless of where I am in the game it makes me think a zombie is right behind, gnawing on my character while I’m stuck saving. It’s never the case, but it’s just a tad annoying to assume as such every time I save.\n\nOverall, the game makes for one very positive experience when you compare it to many other RPG Maker games. But it isn’t just the case of it being a good RPG Maker game, as it is just a solid game on its own. A game where being the hotel manager during a zombie apocalypse is such a bizarre idea, and yet it works and it works well. Couple that with an interesting plot that I really want to see where it ends up, then you’ve got yourself a game that I would personally have to recommend.","January 26","true","1.0"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","25","34","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/recommended/423700/","genkipro","genkipro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/","2517 products in account","NOTE: This game was given to me by the developer for review purposes. This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Apocalypse Hotel is the most creative use of RPG Maker that I've yet seen. In this game you play a young adult survivor of a zombie outbreak (yes, again), although in this case the zombies are people that have been killed and brought back to un-life by alien terraforming of Earth. Returning to your childhood home -- a hotel previously run by your parents -- it's your job to survive, and to make the hotel a safe place for other not-yet-zombified guests.\n\nThe plot is silly, obviously, but it's meant to be. The tongue-in-cheek style is carried through to other aspects of the game, as well. For example, I couldn't help but laugh when I encountered my first companion.\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - It's RPG Maker, so the main game is pixel graphics all around, but they've been put to good use and nothing looks out of place. The still art (particularly the introduction) is not beautiful, but it gets the job done. In fact, I suspect it's intentionally crude in some places.\n\nSound - The music is fantastic and in most cases fits the locations perfectly. In particular, the elevator muzak in the hotel had me smiling. Sound effects are nothing spectacular, but they are serviceable.\n\nGameplay - The controls and action on screen play like any other RPG Maker game, but the unique setting and premise of the game lead to a plot that ties you to your central base (the hotel) and has you venturing out to the zombie-infested surroundings to gather resources, find survivors to become your companions, and complete quests, returning home to recover, craft, and repair and upgrade the hotel. This works well in the early game, but I'm interested to see what will happen once I have fully refurbished my hotel. Will that be the end of the game, I wonder?\n\nThe game is in real time with automatic pausing for menus and other interaction. Combat happens whenever you encounter a zombie wandering around and is handled no differently to the rest of the game, so it too is in real time. On the streets there is plenty of cover that can be used to block your simple-minded enemies, who by and large just take the shortest path towards you, unheeding of any barricades. You start with both ranged and melee weapons, so unless you're up against a much faster or more powerful zombie, or you allow yourself to be surrounded, you have a good fighting chance right from the beginning of the game.\n\nI was initially annoyed that all of the outside areas have zombies and mostly random collectible resources that respawn whenever you leave and re-enter the area, but after playing for a while I realised that it's not only more realistic that way, it also keeps you on your toes, making the game more challenging, and allows for loot runs that don't take ages to travel to the furthest corners of the map.\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ Enjoyable music that fits the different parts of the game very well (I love the elevator muzak in the hotel)\n+ Pretty good pixel graphics\n+ Very original use of RPG Maker engine\n+ Good sense of humour; doesn't take itself too seriously\n+ Extremely responsive developer with a good previous indie game\n\nCons:\n- Buggy with a few grammar errors as well as incorrect information provided on occasion (e.g. no 'o' mentioned on controls screen, while 'e' is mentioned, but doesn't do anything)\n- VERY slow/laggy screen update; almost unplayable on some machines that far exceed the stated recommended requirements (this seems to be an issue with some hardware and some RPG Maker games, particularly with the latest version of RPG Maker, and I don't believe it's the developer's fault)\n- A bit slow to get into and work out what you're doing to begin with\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================Apocalypse Hotel is a fun new RPG Maker game that stands on its own, far out from that very crowded group. It has great style and an enjoyable sense of humour, although at the moment it still suffers from RPG-Maker-related performance problems on some hardware and a number of small bugs.\n\n8/10\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","January 30","true","1.9"," 25 of 40 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","25","40","2","0"

Being mobbed by loads of zombies by torchlight is super scary, almost as scary as the decor in some parts of the hotel itself! Haha! But I've upgraded some rooms and I'm making it work. It's retro!\n\nAnyway, I'm going to go back to playing now, but I'm loving the interplay between aliens, zombies, mutants, and humans - it's a totally refreshing take on this genre and I can't wait to get further into the plot!

While different games in the RPG may not be very satisfactory, Apocalypse Hotel, alongside another of the designers games worked in this genre makes utilization of their own specialty resources. The consideration of their own specialty resources makes the game a lot more fascinating to take a gander at with regards to the visuals, rather than being compelled to have a striking resemblance grass patch you've found in each hurried out RPG Maker ever.\n\nBeing mobbed by heaps of zombies by torchlight is super startling, just about as alarming as the stylistic theme in a few sections of the lodging itself!

Love the idea of roaming around with AI companions, shooting zombies, setting up a functioning hotel, crafting parts. I believe the largest cause of the FPS drop though is the slow following camera, mixed with that border. When things move into screen, while the screen is moving, or if there are animated things the screen is moving into (such as interactables) it causes a large portion of the FPS drop.

The game itself is obviously a RPG Maker game, but it really pushes the engine to what you can actually produce with it.\n\nGameplayApocalypse Hotel - The Post-Apocalyptic Hotel Simulator is a fun and enjoyable game that is based around world building, zombies combined with RPG elements mixed in as well. It seems to be a unique type of zombie game, most zombie games require you to loot things, kill zombie and your main goal is to survive while aquiring missions and such. Although this game does make you loot things and kill zombie your main objective is to build up a hotel as best as you can. It does seem a little strange how something like that can tie into a zombie apocalypse type of game but it is rather unique.\n\nBuilt up from RPG Maker engine this game really shows you what you can do with the engine if you put your mind to it and put some time into creating a game. The final result of this game is that it is rather enjoyable, and has used most if not all of it's own graphics, character sprites and such.\n\nThe gameplay itself is rather simplistic and fun to play around with. It takes a sort of management side of the game as well as looting and gathering resources in order to keep your hotel sustainable throughout the game. Doing things like fixing and repairing the broken pipes and other stuff to keep your hotel in shape.\n\nThe games sound and music are something that I think that the game should be able to crisp up a bit more on to be honest. The sounds are just there, obviously nothing too fancy as it is made in RPG Maker. The music I felt could've been a bit more atmospheric at times when you where fighting through a bunch of zombies.\n\nPros+ Unique type of gameplay\n+ Custom graphics and character sprites\n+ Steam Achievements\n\nCons- At times the music wasn't as to what I would of expected\n- No Steam trading cards\n\nResult / Final thoughtsFor me this game has been rather fun and enjoyable to play. The gameplay is rather unique to the other zombie type games that are out there. The game is heavily focused upon you building your family hotel back up while still keeping the looting style to zombie games. Sometimes the music wasn't what I would've chosen for some of the scenes that I was playing it.\n\nRating 6.8/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games.","April 14","true","2.7"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"
