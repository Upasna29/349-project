Oh, and death comes in many ways.  Freezing to death, wolves, starving to death, wolves, drowning, wolves, lack of shelter, wolves.  Yup.  It's awesome!  No, it is AWESOME - that wasn't sarcasm at all.\n\nI didn't read the forums, read.me file, or anything that would give me the slightest hint on how to play.  I looked only at the controls so I'd know how to move around then I started a game.  I ran around like a ♥♥♥♥♥ trying to figure out what to do.  Nearly starved to death, nearly froze to death.  That didn't happen only because I encountered some less-than-friendly wolves.  They didn't starve to death, I can tell you that much.\n\nI started again.  Ran around like a ♥♥♥♥♥ trying to figure out what to do.  Froze to death after nearly starving to death.\n\nI started over again.  Got a few things together but ran into two wolves who decided that I looked like I wasn't close enough to both freezing and starving to death.  Those wolves also did not starve to death.\n\nI started again.  I looked around the starter area and scavenged for loot.  I got a lean-to and a fire going, then built a house.  I found out where to get food without hunting so I wouldn't starve once my starting food was gone.  I figured out how to hunt deer.  Then I started to make better gear and keep up on the repairs of what I was carrying.  Now I have three houses (Small, regular, stone), a forge, several lean-to structures, several fire pits and a tonne of ore, logs, blue plants, bandages and gear.  I've got enough food for several days and now that I've finally made a longbow and 30-40 arrows hunting is much easier.\n\nThe game got a bit dull after I go to the point where I had everything I needed to survive for a few days.  The character moves so slowly I don't feel like exploring too far yet, but as I build structures farther from my initial town/house I'm sure I will explore a lot more of the island - the size of which is still a mystery as are several other things I've seen so far.\n\nStill in early access - as of 2015-05-27, so keep that in mind if you decide to try it.  That and I had to turn down several settings so it would run fairly well - and I have a decent system.  Pretty sure once it's out of the EA stages it will run better.","May 27, 2015","true","15.9"," 326 of 345 people (94%) found this review helpful 236 people found this review funny","94","326","345","236","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CK81/recommended/307880/","CK81","CK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CK81/","1041 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is an EARLY ACCESS Review and I'll change it after the game is finished.  This is what I think of the game as it sits.\n\nPros\nThe game runs great on my system.   Around 60fps on max settings (Specs on my Profile)\n\nThere's a decent amount to do.  A few different types of wildlife to kill and several different baddies as well as a dragon (Though I'm not sure you can kill the dragon yet, never tried)\n\nThe game in my opinion is beautiful.\n\nIt seems to be pretty solid at the moment.  I have yet to have a game crash with it and had very few bugs.  Only bugs I've had so far are invisible items when playing on others servers and trees glitching out when chopping, the tree would fall but there'd be another in its place that can't be chopped (Think both these bugs were fixed).\n\nCrafting is really easy and getting the materials needed takes no time at all.  You can get in the game quick, build more tools, weapons and armor in no time.\n\nCrafting buildings is easy as well.  Some are really quick, can build a basic house and fire pit in minutes.  The larger ones can take a little bit longer, like the townhall.\n\nIt has multi-player.  This type of game is fun for a while in single player and can keep some people content just playing single, but it also offers multi player with PvP and Non PvP servers (Hostile/Friendly) which just adds to the fun.  Having extra players (Up to 8 as of this review) helping you build towns and survive or to kill make this game well worth it.\n\nCons\nThe game runs pretty good on my system, but sometimes I get fps drops.  Not terrible or unplayable, but noticable.  I think it happens when there seems to be a lot of loot on the ground when it snows.  That's when I've noticed it.  Mostly the game runs great though so a few times of it dropping like that doesn't really ruin the experience for me.\n\nThe combat is OK, real time, but still needs a decent amount of tweaking.  Some things you can circle and barely get hit while attacking it and others can still hit you when you aren't nearly close enough for a hit yourself.  Skeles and I believe a few others need to be tweaked a bit, they can be pretty far from you and as long as they attempt to swing at you, you get hit.\n\nDoesn't have dedicated servers yet (Maybe never) so when the host decides to leave, everything you did on  his server is gone, except the loot you have on you when he does.  Who knows if he plans on coming back either, so basically when you join someones server, you're mainly helping them build their buildings, unless you're there to be a ♥♥♥♥ and steal their items or just harvest materials and leave.   I don't mind joining others servers though, I like helping out and I've met some great people doing so.\n\nHas a max of 8 players. IMO  I think this game should at least offer 16 players or more.\n\nNeeds to have more buildings to craft.  There's really not that many to craft and they bug out easily, meaning that you  have to be on perfectly flat ground, otherwise half your building is floating.  This could be solved by allowing players to terraform or by putting a decent sized foundation on them,  so when the building is on a hill, theres a bottom still.  As we speak, there's no foundation.\n\nReally needs a map, or at least offer a way to craft one or something similar.  The compass doesn't really help as much as I thought it would (Could be I'm just an idiot though)\n\nThere's a decent amount of gear to craft at the moment, but couldn't hurt to have a little more.  For those of you who think there's only a few items, you unlock a lot more after playing a while.  This really isn't a bad thing, I just think it could use a bit more.\n\nWhen I think of more items I think should be here, I'll add them.  But for my experience with the game so far, this is all I have.  The game is pretty solid and offers a decent amount of fun so really, I don't have much to complain about.\n\nI'll be adding some gameplay videos in a while as well.","May 2, 2015","true","91.3"," 260 of 281 people (93%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","93","260","281","7","8"

I have spent the last two weeks investing my life into this game. I have become a part of the wildy frustrating cyclical nature of life and death as I attempt to survive in this unforgiving landscape.\n\nAs a building game I think the interface is great and easy to navigate. It is one that keeps me excited about running out to face the wild so that I can gather what is neccesary to survive.\n\nAs a "Skyrim"-esque type of adventure/combat game, I think we have something really special here. The terrain, and varying enemies seen so far provide a challenging and rewarding experience that really keeps players involved. Following the sun and being able to commit to terrain association is a life saver in this and I wouldnt have it any other way.\n\nMost importantly, It is the nature of the team dynamic that I have found most interesting in this game. While going at alone is very much a possibility, It is in teamwork that I have found a truly rewarding experience. NAvigating the forests with your friends, staying within line of sight and having constant communication makes for a play through unlike anything i've played in a long time. The need to cooperate in order to survive is illustrated quite well. I've found the utilization of team play to be the most important dynamic of an excellent play through.\n\nThings are only getting better with time. Aside from a few hiccups here and there as expected. I would suggest to any and all readers to go ahead and take a chance on this game if it is even remotely in your interests. I assure you that it will be a game that you will always remember, and with the time and work currently being put into the title, It will become the new standard for what we want in games.","July 8, 2015","true","27.3"," 310 of 348 people (89%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","89","310","348","22","21"

I will not waste a lot of time doing this review so don't expect it to be long. But I am here to say that these guys are full of ♥♥♥♥ and scammers. If you go to watch their website you find all of their games and here is the link https://www.digitaldnagames.com/ they have a lot of games, one of them is "castleminers Z". and you can find a lot of bad comments in there about how they just abandonded their game and stopped developing it. And the biggest thing is they are using false names on steam, so you want to see what games does this "digital dna games" have steam will show that they have nothing... And there is where the scam is. That's how you will not see that they have developed some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ unfinished Early access games. So my point is take a look at those before even considering, if you still want to buy this game then it is up to you, but you highly recommend not, unless you like playing unfinished game what will never be done.

Reason for that is devs are making a great effort, working very close with the community, in upgrading it and improving, making it better and better on a weekly basis.\nAnd i think now we should all just be a bit more patient, and like devs have said many times already, they are working as fast as they can on fixing bugs and issues and adding more content which will in the end, i am sure, make this game more fun and more difficult for everyone (like for example adding new creatures, new enemies like idk forest gremlins; tweaking existing ones so they pose a bigger threat; adding combat with Kur the dragon, and a lot of other stuff that is planned).\nI dont think this game should only be based on basic survival..never ending cicle of gathering food and wood and not moving away from the safety of your cabin on the beach. It didnt make much sense how it was in the beginnings, when cooked deer meat recuperated only 10-15% of your hunger if i remember right, you needed to eat probably over 100 deer meat per day in order to survive one day/night cicle, dont even remember anymore :P not to mention not being able to re-use firepits after they burn out. It also doesnt make much sense to me and its a bit annoying if hunger meter drops that quickly that you need to eat a piece of meat every minute, or cold meter dropping that quickly that you need to "sit" by the fire entire day. I think hunger and cold meter are working just fine now and since then there has been a lot of progress made and game is constantly getting better in all fields .\nI think it is not easy to find the perfect balance between easy and hard, but i am sure that with our help they will do it right in the end :)\nWhat i believe will make it more fun and challenging is them adding stuff mentioned above.\nI am looking forward to new updates :)\n","August 3, 2015","true","670.6"," 213 of 245 people (87%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","87","213","245","23","20"

In Savage Lands you have one goal, survive. Survival is not easy though, not only do you have to contend with your hunger thirst and body temperature you also must fight for survival against deadly creatures ranging from reanimated skeletons to a fire breathing dragon. Savage Lands is effectively a mixture of Skyrim (world design) and The Forest (gameplay) which is in no way a bad thing, in fact it creates an interesting game from a somewhat stagnating genre.\n\n+Decent graphics/style even on minimum settings (more on that later)\n+Great world design, ranging from the environment to the creatures within the game, everything is well done and fits together\n+Fun resource gathering mechanics which work similarly to The Forest, felling trees is oh so satisfying\n+Simple and easy to use crafting system, again works much in the same way as The Forest where you have a book of craftable items which can be made once you have the necessary resources in your inventory\n+Building structures, ranging from tiny lean-tos to large stone buildings, is again simple and works the same way as it does in The Forest where you choose want you want to make and then an outline is placed on the ground where you gradually put the resources such as logs and sticks\n+Staying alive is genuinely difficult without even taking the creatures into consideration as you battle to keep warm, hydrated and full of food\n+It's very easy to get lost in the world (how is that a good thing I hear you ask) which again adds to the difficulty of the game which for something like this is no bad thing\n+There are pre-built structures and villages for you to explore in the world\n+Character saves and world saves are seperate meaning you can take your characters from your world and play them in a friend's world for example\n+There are already lots of items to craft and more are being added\n+The developers are active on Steam which is nice to see, particularly for an Early Access game\n\n+/-When you die you lose all of your stuff which makes starting again with that character considerably harder\n+/-No PvP in multiplayer sessions\n\n-It runs awfully on my PC. I have everything apart from resolution set on minimum and I can't even get 30FPS which really is not good enough\n-Animations aren't great, they don't look overly realistic\n-No pausing in single player sessions, one of my pet peeves in games, really can't stand it\n-Some of the hitboxes are way too small for the object they are for, for example the bushes that drop sticks\n\nPC Spec:\nCPU: Intel Core i7-4770 @ 3.4GHz\nGPU: Nvidia Geforce GT640 4GB VRAM\nRAM:10GB\nHDD: 2TB\nOS: Windows 8.1 64 bit\n\nVerdict:\n8\n\nA brutal open world survival game with good mechanics, good world design and a difficulty level that provides a real challenge to stay alive.\n\n***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***\n\nEl K.","April 26, 2015","true","8.3"," 311 of 375 people (83%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","83","311","375","19","25"

The atmosphere of the game is amazing.\n\n2. Playing with other people and helping each other out in such a well done atmospheric setting is an experience that leaves a very good impact on the feels.\n\n3. None of the reviews I've seen so far seem to have touched on the atmosphere of the game much.\n\nMy time in this game so far was spent in an online hosted game where I started out knowing little but was quickly brought up to speed from asking questions to the other people in the game. They helped me figure out some things I needed to complete the tasks assigned by the game when you first start. At the same time I helped collect resources to continue the development of our little village that was forming and scouting any nearby enemies, mainly wolves and skeletons. Once I finished all my tasks initially assigned by the game (basic ones I'm assuming to help you get into the game and to know what you're doing) I thanked my fellow adventurers for the assistance and logged off.\n\nDuring the above in game actions I encountered a few more things that honestly helped me to fall in love with this game's atmosphere rather quickly. Here is a short list of things I enjoyed:\n\n- Standing next to the other players near a fire to keep warm.\n- Hearing the fire crackling and popping.\n- Hearing the cold winds howling around and sounds of nearby animals/creatures.\n- Hearing my character breathing heavily in the cold air as well as almost a sniffling sound during this process.\n- Witnessing the scenery during the different times of day, especially in the evening/during sun set.\n\nHonestly, if you play games for their immersion and emotional interactions, this game is priceless (Especially with a good pair of headphones, as well as a headset as you can hold Tab to talk to other players). Content and basically everything else will come in time and can be added in the future but the atmosphere is something that has to be done right early on. In this game, it is, and the developers seem loyal to producing more content and considering good feedback and suggestions from the community.\n\nOn another note (and I'm sure this is because the game is in early access) I can see where you can run out of things to do in the game currently, however I have obviously not made it there yet due to my 90 minutes of actual play time. I don't think this will be much of a problem for me though, because I've already found great enjoyment in doing simple things such as the events described above.\n\nI look forward to playing this game a lot in the future and as of right now I'm hooked on it!","October 5, 2015","true","34.7"," 193 of 223 people (87%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","87","193","223","10","20"

I'm not saying the entire game should be put on easy-mode.  What I am saying is that keeping it challenging and fun is obviously a big deal (for any game) and keeping in mind that not all the player base of any given game does not and will not ever think alike.  Making it so that one person can make it easier for their single player game while another keeps it just as harsh and unforgiving, should be an option.\n\nI know that this game has a huge following (and for good reason) and I will most likely get crap for this but it is my honest opinion of the game that I played so far.  I love the fact that the devs are so awesome at keeping in touch with the player base and letting people know about upcoming updates & fixes as well as keeping everyone informed about what was just done to the game to update it as well.  But the game-play is just too harsh.\n\n\nTL;DR This game is too unforgiving.  I realize it is supposed to be a challenge but to be so punished for exploring in any sort of way is just boring to me.  Every time I turned around there was a pack of wolves bleeding me out.  I was fine with the skeletons, they were easy and making a spawn point was nice.  I made a small house and blacksmith place along with a fire near the coast.  The moment I decided to start exploring any of my surroundings though, this game took a huge nose-dive.\n\nPros:\n-Devs keep up with the game and with the players informing them of when they are coming out with the next update and making older updates and their information, very easy to obtain and understand.\n\n-Beautiful land\n\n-Wide variety of monsters & animals\n\n-Love the fact that you are actually effected by the cold environment\n\n-HUGE variety of craftable/cooking items that you can very easily learn as you go (the items basically explain themselves for the most part as their titles usually say exactly what would drop them i.e. wolf pelt instead of just more leather)\n\n-Devs listen & pay attention to their player base, huge plus\n\n-Models are very nice looking, animation is very well done (the skeleton scared the crap out of me lurking out of the forest how it did)\n\n-Weather effects are stunning and can impair the player's vision very easily adding to a tense atmosphere\n---------------------------\n\nCons:\n-They wanted this to be *too* unforgiving\n\n-Sometimes crafting doesn't seem to follow a pattern and can be somewhat confusing.  I.E. I picked up some medium quality metal, suddenly I know an entire Ebony set I cannot possibly make while I don't know how to create a longbow but I can make the arrows for it.  (Having a more simplified crafting system with leveled patterns would be easier to use/understand.)\n\n-Bleed till you die, there is no way to stop it without bandages and it will never slow down\n\n-Packs of wolves can sometimes come at you in 2-3 packs at once and they will never stop hunting you\n\n-The reach of skeletons & wolves is too great, with a tool in my hand I was unable to hit them at the length they were easily able to punch me\n\n-Frustration/annoyance/repeat; does not equal good game play\n\n-Basically forced to do multiplayer because of the way the enemies are from the get-go is very unappealing to me as I prefer solo/co-op with my husband, not 8 or however many other people\n\n-Starvation & freezing to death comes too easily and too fast for someone having to run around at night (after crafting all day) hitting deers in the butt one slap at a time while dying in the dark\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nBeing a big fan of single & co-op player modes, I wish there was a way to set this on an easier scale for people who cannot devote 6 hours of game time a day.","June 14, 2015","false","17.0"," 549 of 714 people (77%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","77","549","714","29","34"

You really have to work hard to stay alive. I only wish the hunger meter was slower. You get hungry way to fast.\nThings I would like to see added:\n1) More deer.\n2) More things to build, like walls, pits, shelves etc.\n3) crouch\n4) spears to use in hand or throw\n5) beds for resting\n6) blankets ( lol. why it so cold all the time? )\n7) more biomes. not just snow.\n8) Also, when you build a home, away to designate a marker so you can find it by looking for floaty symbol. Currently been lost 2 days trying to find my home.\n9) Better collision and clipping (deer aint supposed to walk thru boulders, is this Rust? lol)\n10) just more, more, more...I love this game\n\nLove the AI of enemies.

That Fu##er can move fast.\n\nThe dragons are beautiful and can breathe fire really far. Nice. The fire FX are really nice to.\n\nAll in all, I think this game is amazing as is but I am greedy and want more of it.\n\nI give this game a 9.9/10 (no game is perfect, regardless of what some 'game reviewers' say. Thank you.\n\nEDIT:04/04/16\n\nGame seems to have a lot of issues. So I will list what I've seen below:\n1. Trying to get sticks and logs from trees now is hit or miss. Sometimes chopping down a tree completely, just gives you a downed tree that you can't harvest.\n2. The ghost overlay on some things you wanna build even after built, never goes away.\n3. Choppy or stuttery display. Even random frame dips while standing still.\n4. Starting a new game because of updates. Which is understandable but, you might have to try it several times before it works correctly.\n5. Back to the ghost overlay for building. Sometimes, even after you've applied all components, it has you cycle through them again. So basically, you're building it twice, in the same spot.\n6. Cannot seem to make the game run smooth anymore. I have twice deleted/uninstalled and it stays the same performance level even trying to turn things down. And since I've first got the game have upgraded my pc. Confused as to why better pc means worse performance on this game.\n7. Characters now start off naked. Does Rust come to mind?\n\nI will leave my recommend status as is, but in truth no longer recommend this to new users until the game is fully done. This was one of my favorite survival games, now has moved closer to the bottom.

I have enjoyed over 100 hours of adventure in the game. At some point you will come to a pass and ask yourself, What next.\n\nThe sand box is big.

If I never played another day of the game, I would not be disappointed in what I have spent.\n\n\nThe down side is that the game has such great potential. Yes you are hearing me right. When this happens to a game peoples mines go crazy. It could be this, it could be that. Purple flying pigs that poop loot. The game is great just simple. Survive the cold harsh land. Our imaginations set us up for disappointment if we let it. I hope the community aiding in the direction of this game keep it true to its nature.\n\n\n","March 23, 2015","true","328.7"," 150 of 174 people (86%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","86","150","174","22","3"

I would recommend this game to anyone with the stones big enough to face a challenge bigger than blocky faces and manipulated difficulty. Below are some of the things that stood out as good, bad, and some things I believe would make the game perfect.\n9/10\n\n(ABOVE IS JUST FOR PEOPLE SKIMMING THE REVIEWS, BELOW IS FOR THOSE WISHING FOR INDEPTH REVIEWS!)\n\nIt should be noted that I am at day 4, so some of the ideas covered below are about those 4 days and what was recorded during the process of survival.\n\n\nThe Good:\n\n- Beautiful landscape, I am left breathless at the sheer beauty the land reveals upon each morning.\n- Tenacious wildlife, I am often left speechless at the stubborn force of the wolves and wargs.\n- Unique resource gathering, I cannot help but grin as my axe fells a towering monument of wood.\n- Unique crafting, I am in awe each time I get to craft a new item.\n- Unique building, each time I finish a structure, I can't decide what to focus on constructing next!\n- Harsh environment, I am always in a state of alert as I prowl the wilderness for food, resources, or game.\n- The scary @$$ dragon, actually I find myself running in fear each time I hear that thing roar.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Sometimes when you drop an item bag (like the Tattered one you start with) it stays with you. Not exactly a bad thing, but when you gather resources, the items sometimes go to the dropped bag.\n- Sometimes when you cut a tree down, the tree will stay up, duplicating a fallen tree unto the ground. While you cannot harvest the tree infinately, it becomes a visual nucience and impairs your building spaces.\n- Sometimes the Warg-like beasts come out during the day near the tower, they didn't attack me, but I found it to be odd that I couldn't even hit them, as they drifted between underground and overground rapidly.\n- I'm not sure if you can, but I can't seem to reignite torches after they get snuffed out.\n- Armor durability, I understand some of the armors aren't exactly ment for combat, and thus obviously would have low durability, but I'm far more sure that they should last at least a day and a half for each set.\n\n\nSuggestions:\n\n- Potion brewing would be a nice touch. Gathering berries, herbs, and various items to mix. Maybe as a potion bottle, a reusable metal container?\n- Going along with the idea of the land being a harsh environment featuring wolves, dragons, wargs and bears, how about witchcraft? Drawing runes on swords or armor to augment them or imbuing a stick to be used as an offencive fire spouting staff/ wand?\n- Farming? Seeing as how you can build a house, a fire, a forge, and a townhall. Why not a garden as well? You could take unspoiled fruits and vegatables and gather their seeds, plant them, and gather them?\n- Rain? Even though the biggest fear in the game is not the cold, why not push the fact that it SHOULD be something to worry about?\n- Fences? Wood walls and doors are good, but to push the idea of building a safe residence, utilizing fences would help some people cope with the night.\n\n(Written 3/29/15 at 3:52 AM with 8.9 Hours of play.)","March 29, 2015","true","11.8"," 105 of 122 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","105","122","2","7"

Well, I'm happy to say this is one of those rare games in the genre that manages to distinguish itself. I've been having a great time with this title exploring and surviving, it has that magic I'm always looking for.\n\nForemost I have to talk about the high visibility of the devs. When I say high visbility, I mean the highest I've ever seen. I see them all over the forums, live streams where they show what they're working on and answer questions, heck the in game menu even says when the next update is going to be. These guys really know what being accountable is and they do everything early access devs should be doing. Come what may I'm really glad to have supported this crew, they should be the example other devs look to when doing an early access game.\n\nThe topic I'd like to weigh in on most is crafting. I see curators and other reviewers tout the crafting in this game so I think it's worth a minute of my review to talk about what crafting is and is not here. If you're looking at this game from the view point of a craftaholic this game isn't going to scratch that itch. You won't be building massive creative works here, it's not a creative outlet. Crafting is somewhat streamlined and is essentially your means of progression. As you create better gear you can venture to more dangerous areas to get better materials to make even better gear. You could consider this a "gear grind" though I found it doesn't feel like much of a grind and really isn't that much of a time sink once you know where to go and what to get.\n\nBeyond that there isn't much I can say that isn't said in most other reviews. Great title I'm proud to support.","December 26, 2015","true","21.7"," 81 of 88 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","81","88","4","1"

The atmosphere is excellent and can be very creepy. I really did feel like I was alone in a hostile land, and at first it took me a long time to feel secure enough to wander into unsafe areas.\n\nYou have a health bar, of course. The other two are hunger and cold. Cold is your first enemy in this game. There's no thirst bar, which makes sense as there is snow practically everywhere so you could easily melt some down; it's fair to assume you have enough water.\n\nYou're limited to pre-designed buildings, and rather few designs. I don't see a problem with basic shacks and such because you'll probably be building a lot of them to give yourself safe harbor as you explore. This isn't a "design and build a beautiful and complex base from the ground up" style of game, this is a "pile some sticks together before you freeze to death and the wolves gnaw upon your frostbitten corpse" game and I enjoy the roughness of it.\n\nI'm coming at this from a slightly unusual angle because this was the first survival game I ever played. I didn't have any expectations of what building should be like, or crafting, or any of the mainstays of the genre. Since playing Savage Lands I have been hooked on survival games and have been branching out, but I feel it's an excellent introduction, partially because of the limits in buildings; it's less likely to overwhelm a new player. I don't know what the devs' plans are for expanding the building system, but I do hope they keep the prefabs in there as an option for when you just need to get a shack up as fast as possible before the sun goes down and the nasties come out.\n\nThis game also seems to have broken me from my reliance on minimaps. You are forced to navigate with only a compass and landmarks, and this actually becomes surprisingly second-nature. (Side note: there are a lot of people who are confused about how the compass works— the point of the needle always points to the north. That's it. It's no more complicated than that.)\n\nBeing Early Access there are some features missing, for example there are no female characters yet. However, they are confirmed to be in development and they will have realistic armor. The devs listen to the community (you can even vote on features), are extremely active and give information constantly. Frequent updates are made and I have no doubt the devs will deliver on their promises. This game has a bright future.","January 6","true","47.5"," 95 of 109 people (87%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","87","95","109","9","0"

With all the disappointments i`ve had in gaming this has been a real pleasant suprise.\nIt`s fun and well worth the price of purchase. It takes awhile, like any decent game to figure out the best way to slay those evil buggers running around but you will get the hang of it after a couple hours.\nThe game runs smooth,the graphics and audio well serve their purpose and for an early release it`s just awesome!\nStarting off is the hardest part. you're naked and weaponless,competely vulnerable to everything. In time you will have more food and gear than you'll know what to do with. It's challenging and fun.\nThe saved game set up can be slighty  confusing.

It`s easy to get lost sometimes, Some numerals on the compass would help for us spacialy challenged folks..lol They`re there,just hard to read at times.\nThings i`d like to see, if i could be so preumptious; perhaps having the tide bring in the odd item (household items maybe), to be able to find and raise a wolf cub as a companion,caves or underground lairs,fishing and to be able to create targets for improved proficiency in archery.It doesn`t matter though,the developers clearly care and i know they`ll do what they can in time.\nRemember to not wander off to far when you start or your in for a long,naked journey to retrieve your gear.lol.

Here are my impressions after putting some time into the game.\n\nUnlike most other games, you can build your character up in offline mode, and then take that character into multiplayer servers, pvp or friendly.\n\nIf you host the server, your world becomes the game world, and whatever was in your world, is part of that online world.  Multiplayer servers do NOT require any port passthrough to run a server, (no firewall changes).\n\nThe game reminds me of Skyrim, both in visual looks and in the theme.  The crafting is simplified, and fun.  Save whatever you ever pick up, and dump it in your base, you will use it eventually.\n\nUntil you beef up your character, don't venture deep into the forest at night.\n\nBuild your house / village on the coast and remove several hundred yards of trees and bushes radiating outward from your base, so you can see critters.\n\nGet a fire going first, chop some bushes for some berries, make some basic tools and weapons, get wolf armor..these are your first basic steps.\n\nThe easiest way to defeat any tough creature is to run backwards (backpedal) and swing your weapon at the enemy.\n\nI don't know why, but the dragon ignores you, and you can even build a house under his roost.  UPDATE: the new build has the dragon trying to attack you when he is flyinh.  Nice!\n\nThe game gets updates in a regular fashion, and announces it on the front page in a countdown clock.\n\nMultiplayer hosts can kick or ban people, and I have seen some strange and disruptive people and have had to ban people for extremely offensive names.\n\nI like this game, and I hope that you do too.","June 2, 2015","true","46.4"," 69 of 78 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","69","78","2","7"

On the other hand, there was a lot of potential when I got the game three months ago, and the progress since then has been... disappointing. I've had this in my library beside The Long Dark, Stranded Deep, The Forest, and Who's Your Daddy, and out of them all Savage Lands has changed the least, even though I've only had TLD longer.\n\nIn terms of playability, the features that are present are nice. The mixture of construction, combat, and survival means that you're constantly switching tasks to stay on top of everything. On the other hand, individually, each aspect is very grindy and the balance is too straightforward.\n\nThe starting monsters are ridiculously easy, even with the most basic weapon, and yet until you get advanced weapons the very second tier are almost impossible. The hit boxes for the targets are sometimes awwkard, and the archery system is a joke. On the other hand, there's a decent selection of monsters and the drop rates are very well balanced, so once combat mechanics are refined this aspect should be above par.\n\nBuilding is also above par, with a decent number of structures and an excellent placement system. HOWEVER, having to build an entire smithy just to have a forge feels like overkill and gathering the resources for a new base takes forever. In addition, for noncooperative multiplayer, defensive capabilities could be much improved.\n\nSurvival is very basic. Don't get cold, hungry, or injured and you'll be good to go. Some sort of meat vs. plant nutritional balance or a more in-depth breakdown of clothing's effect on the cold stat would tremendously improve this option.\n\nThe UI is... interesting. It's toeing the line between retro and just plain dated, but it isn't difficult to understand, though without information on weather or stamina its use is limited. In addition, colored boxes with the health conditions spelled out and visible percentages seem to be conflicting with the minimalist feel.\n\nOn the whole, I look forward to changing my recommendation when the game improves. Hopefully the pace will pick up and that day won't be years away.","February 25","false","12.8"," 96 of 121 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","96","121","5","61"

SL is dying for a dynamic questing or dungeon system... with about 3 times the monster mobs. It definitely needs more stuff. MOre active POI destinations .But... it is an early access game and the devs appear to be very responsive.\n\nHere is my first game experience before restarting with a hosted game for me and my son.\n\nGame starts with my on the shores. Cheap clothes, a tiny sack of starter food and a few little sundries lying on the beach. There is a checklist of things to do to get started, including gathering and building the first camp fire and leanto.\n\nStone axe to chop trees(which fall nicely). Must craft a stone hammer to mine rocks for stone, flint, ore, coal, etc...(this needs to be developed into caves and proper mining). Cotton for cloth to make bandages(wolves cause bleeds).\n\nIt is dangerous and cold our there. You NEED a campfire and a home. Night time is frigid... and a blizzard at night will kill you in minutes with just the starter clothes.\n\nThere are pre-mades. They are god. I found a couple of small ones to move into... and created another one to make a settlement. I started working on a blacksmith house to get the critical forge.\n\nI figured I had a handle on it enough to get my son going, so I abandoned that game to host one for the family.\n\nIt went very well, and my son and I had a great time. We found another settlement to claim and started work, but I didn't get the items to make a hammer... and ran out of flint. I froze to death on night number 2. Because we had not finished the respawn totem, I had to run naked and unarmed in the dawn's early light.\n\nAnd I cam across an abandoned village with 5 buildings... including a working forge!!!\n\nIt was an exciting surprise and we moved right away to the new homestead. Unfortunately, these structures are not procedurally generated, so there really is no reason to build one once you know where they are. This takes away the need for the intriguing structure crafting system. It literally invalidates it. They only think I HAVE to build...is the respawn point. AN entire path of advancement... POOF!!!\n\nMy hope is that the devs nerf their usefulness... perhaps by halving the heat protection and requiring constant repair to eat resources and time, making a player structure desirable. My preference would be to also have viking like mobs that already live there that need to be conquered.\n\nStill... there is a good game here with much potential... and the impression I get is that the devs WANT that potential and are very active with the community of players to get guidance on what the priorities should be.\n\nIn the meantime, my kids and I enjoy the coop experience.","May 24, 2015","true","11.9"," 61 of 72 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","61","72","2","6"

But, once I actually started playing this game, I realized some things:\n\nPros:\n-Possibility for some interesting lore\n-very challenging\n-Harsh survival\n-the dev team is actually pretty involved, which is more than what can be said for many games like this.\n\nCons:\n-I've had this game for quite a while, and there has been little to no actual change in the gameplay, despite updates being pushed out sometimes.\n-Terrible framerate, this game is not optimized at ALL.\n-The Difficulty of this game can make it seem like a chore to play.\n-There really isn't that much to do in this game, even though it may seem so at the start.\n\nSo I personaly would recommend splurging on a surival game that's actually complete.

The game has a definite learning curve, and it doesn't hold your hand much aside from the starter gear at the beginning and the codex that shows you what resources you need for the items you've unlocked thus far.  You'll probably die every night until you figure out what the hell you're doing, and even after that it'll continue to beat you down at every chance it gets.  You'll need to fight off starvation, wild animals, risen skeletons and the biting cold as you struggle to carve out a foothold in the unforgiving wilderness, from crafting a bow to hunt deer with to bulking up in armour and wondering how the hell you're supposed to kill the dragon on the top of the tower looming over the forest.  Rapidly becoming one of my favourite survival games, though while in early access there are still a few bugs that need to be taken care of.

I've played for almost three hundred hours and have accomplished nothing except waisting my time on a bad build. Animals still glitch out sinking into the mountains. Still cannot kill KUR. Love the concept and would love the game, but there has to be a resolve. It was a great game with a great concept. I'm not fully understanding the updating when the updates are making this great game worse. Weapons suck compared to enemies, Armor sucks compared to enemies damage. How can you build dragon scale armor if you can't kill the dragon. The hunger aspect sucks. It's hard to enjoy the game when you spend two hours hunting for food to run out in 10 minutes. I have to hunt for the game host since they can't hunt on there own, due to the animals running from the  host. Animals kick wooden chest all over the place even inside a building. Can't build where I want or need to. Way to much sinew and hide. trash been is working better, but takes too long to empty and you can't get rid of your heads off your dead bodies. I could list alot more... I don't cheat on games. Is that what I have to resolve to just to play this game.

Their updates balance improving performance, graphics and content which is great to see.  Many early access games i have bought fail to keep such a balance so i have high hopes for this game.\n\nThe only thing that i have a problem with the game which i dont know if the developers can do much about, besides more marketing is the fact that i can never find an avalible public server to play on.  To me, this really takes away from the appeal.  Just somthing about playing with others, even if i am just going out on my own and having side conversations with others makes the game more fun.\n\nSince this is early access and the pros way outweigh the cons, i would still definately reccomend this game, it definately stands out among all of the other "survival crafting RPG" like games that i have played or seen come out.","February 21","true","32.3"," 47 of 53 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","47","53","3","0"

From the moment you set foot on the beach and begin freezing to death, Savage Lands does not let up. Scavange the land, collect resources, build a shelter, fashion weapons and armor, because the beasties that attack by day, have even more dangerous counterparts at night. Skeleton's attack relentlessly the further inland you travel. Other horrors await the explorer as well.\n\nI only intended on playing a short while, just to get a feel for the game so I could write about it. I ended up spending 6 hours playing Savage Lands, before I realized what time it was. I had a blast with this game. Savage Lands is in Early-Access so they are making changes and developing it. Multiplayer is available for those interested, according to the website, so this should be of interest to anyone who wants to Co-Op, or PVP through Savage Lands.\n\nI would hope they eventually increase the crafting recipes and allow you to make more things. All in all, I think it is worth picking up even in early access, as they are definitely on the right track with the game.","June 30, 2015","true","11.8"," 65 of 82 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","65","82","2","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toxxn/recommended/307880/","toxxn","Toxxn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toxxn/","114 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNormally I wouldn't write full in-depth review for an early access game. It would be kind of unfair to do so considering the full experience of the game has yet to come. However there are things I would like to talk about and address to both new players and the developers.\n\nThe best way to describe Savage Lands, it's like a combination between The Forest and Elder Scrolls.\n\nKeeping in mind that this game is early access, it does have its problems. Unlike the typical early access game where you usually experience connection issues, lag, glitches, etc. this game is actually pretty well built without these issues. Loads times are actually pretty phenomenal and there are little issue involving bugs/ glitches, at least from what I have experienced. A couple de-syncs every so often, however that is most likely becuase we had three players connected to a private hosted server via the same local connection. The main issue with the game is the lack in overall content however that is to be expected.\n\nIn the feature list under the game description, there are two 'features' I would like to address.\nRobust Item Crafting and Intuitive Build System.\n\nBefore I delve into the issues with these features, I would like to state that I am fully aware and understand that Signal Studios has not released all the content yet, hence 'early access', however at this time, the descriptions of these features are not accurate. Mind you, these are listed as "Early Release Features", which means that they were intentionally listed as features being currently in the game. I disagree.\n\nRobust Item Crafting\nCrafting works and it's not bad, however in the description for this feature it states "Limitless Options". There is a lot of potential with the crafting, so I have no doubt that the developers are going to be progressing the possibilities making this description more accurate, currently however, it's just to far from limitless for this description to be accurate. There are only a handful of craftable weapons/ tools and armor, and a good portion of them require harder to get and rarer materials.\n\nIntuitive Building System\nIf you have ever played The Forest, the building system is exactly the same. Its simple, but there isn't really much you can build other than a few structures. I would really like to see more structures added as well as customization, decoration, and more function added for the structures as well. As of right now, other than getting a couple of achievements  it's really not worth the time and effort to build anything. Find a pre-existing city on the map and make base, it will have everything you need already minus strong boxes.\n\n\nAs for the rest of the listed current features, the descriptions are fairly accurate. The world is anything but forgiving and you never know when an enemy is going to charge at you out of nowhere unless you are in an open area and even then, if you aren't paying attention to your surroundings, you will find trouble pretty quick, or rather trouble will find you. The AI system is spot on and the combat is indeed brutal and can get pretty intense. Perhaps a little too intense. One minute you are chasing a deer, then suddenly you are fighting a Dire Wolf that popped out from the bushes. Next minute you are fighting a whole pack of them. But hey, what fun would the game be if the combat were too easy? The game certainly teaches you to stay aware of your surroundings. The game is more fun in multiplayer, albeit if you want more of a challenge, play solo.\n\n\nOverall, the game is very fun and addicting. I would even go as far to say it is the best early access game I have played to date, even with its limited content. With that said, there is still plenty to do while the developers are working hard to bring us more content. I actually would not mind collaborating with the developers and sharing ideas for future content, as this game has some great potential to be one of the best open world survival games to date and I would love to see this game succeed. So if any developers are reading this, feel free to add and/or message me. I would gladly share some ideas and options. Nonetheless, keep up the great work.","January 24","true","88.6"," 39 of 41 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","39","41","0","0"

It has its own unique storyline and lore, The AI can be very challenging at first but you learn how to fight each type of mob you face as you progress to tougher mobs further inland on the island. You are shipwrecked on an old ancient island filled with ghost towns (not ghost) undead, mystical creatures and even Dragons. You hunt for food, deer, goats bear etc. and besides meat you need to farm skins and other things used for crafting.\n\nCrafting is fairly detailed, You can make better weapons and clothing, prepare food and even build structures to get you through the cold winter nights. Crafting is a key feature to this game and to get some of the better wapons and armor to craft you need rare ingredients from tougher AI to craft certain things. The game does a good job at building up to be able to kill the more tougher AI and so on.  As you build better armor and weapons you can fight tougher mobs and get better and more rare ingredients so you can build even better things to fight even tougher mobs and so on and so on. The balance in this respect is very good indeed.\n\nThe game is going through a change right now, and it is for the better. The game is in the middle of an engine upgrade that touts a brand new map and a much better layout that improves the progression from being a noob to a full outfitted badass ready to slay some dragons.  The new map is a beta op-in and as a new player you will get the relativly bug free old map to start with until the conversion is complete. The devs have gone out of their way to ensure old toons can be carried over to the new map if this is something you want. (and I did) The old map is fairly bug free and very enjoyable the new opt in beta map, although MUCH better still hosts a lot of bugs and this is why it is opt in only. It is meant for veteran players who know the game and can give good bug reports.\n\nNow this review would be incomplete without makeing a point that I have never had the privledge to make in any other steam game. This game BY FAR has the best Devs around. They are here everyday. helping, answering, listening to feed back. If you ask a question you will often get more then one dev answering to it. They will go out of their way to listen to you, help you and listen to your feedback both good and bad. I want to give you two examples off the top of my head.\n\n1st, Someone had a bug that made him loose all his gear, Put it in the bug section. and was probably ok with laving it at that. Not for the Devs, They started an MP server gave him the info and replaced EVERYTHING he lost.\n\n2nd, My family went away for xmas and I was home alone and decided to get into the firewater and light myself up while I played some savage lands. I ran into a prob or question (do not remember which) at 2 am Xmas eve. and guess what, there was a dev there to help me out within 10 minutes. They should have been sleeeping or with family and friends for Xmas but they CARE so much about this game that even on Xmas eve they were there to support their customers.\n\nI can not tell you enough about the commitment to this game these devs have, it shows in the forums and in the love they have for this game itself.  If there was a reward for the best Devs in steam forums these guys would win hands down. We all know how toxic steam forums can get when customers are not happy and they are not getting answers and the devs are know where to be found. I have yet to find a toxic or even negative post in the forums for this game and it all starts from the top down. The game itself is great but the commitment and openess of these devs makes the atmoshpere around here second to none.\n\nUpdates are very frequent. Every 5-10 days or so. The old map is no longer being updated and it is all on the new map. Of course this makes sence as the old map will be gone once the final switch to the new engine and map are complete. It is fair to say that if you are new and get the old map you are still getting a very complete game even for it being an early access title.  Starting on the old map is still a great play and in no means a lessor experience do to the fact it is no longer being supported. Of course there is nothing stopping you from opting in and starting off on the new map but I would not reccomend it yet. The old map is solid and complete and is a great way to learn the game in a relativley bug free enviroment.\n\nThe game has great replayability and I expect great things from it for no other reason then how much the devs love this game. These guys are building a game for the love of seeing a game they made and to make it great, not for money or any of the other things some dev teams do to get their name out there or whatever.\n\nIt is a SP and MP survival game that has been a great add to my collection of survival games I love. It has been a good 2 years for EA survival games for me with other titles like, The Forest, The Long Dark 7D2D and of course Savage Lands and just like the others I am happy to own this title in my collection. It is unique in its own way and well worth the price for an EA title and would be worth full retail of a finished game, if you get it on sale (like I did) it is a downright steal. If you enjoy survival games then I reccomend it, If you like supporting small EA dev teams then this is by far the most worthy team I have ever seen.\n\nMost of the EA titles I own I do not worry about, they will see the light of day and full release. But this one, I have never even considered anything otherwise. This dev team loves this game so much they would finish it in a coffee shop stealing free wi-fi whilst living on the street and panhandling for food money in order to see this game finished.\n\nGame 8.5-10\nDevs 11-10\n","January 14","true","482.2"," 43 of 48 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","43","48","6","2"

Firstly, the game is amazing. My friends and I basically described it as „Minecraft meets Skyrim“ game, which, to be honest, is amazing. The whole progressing aspect of the game is very pleasing. The whole story of the game is nice (at least the story that's made for now), enemies are great (but I'd personally like to see many different types of animals and a whole ton of enemies to fight). Weapons and tools are cool and I expect more of the same sort. Overall, game is great and I hope that there will be many more things added.\nCommends:\n-Weapons are great, different types. You've taken attack speed in count, damage, building damage and special item effects (soul storm)\n-Many different enemies with different attacks and item drops\n-Overall graphics of the game are amazing!\n-Progressively advancing through the game\n-Amazing with friends\n-Structure building\n-Survival aspect (game can be harsh which, in this case, is good)\n-Weather aspect (snowstorms), maybe add in some other.\n\nCritics:\n-No fall damage (at least what I've witnessed)\n-Enemies should have more animations (attack, death, running, etc.)\n-Animations for certain actions (for example that you cannot simply take animal skin from inventory but rather skin the animal for it)\n-Not being able to place chests yourself (they basically just drop once you remove them from inventory and that's where they'll stay). Should be placable like structures, campfires.\n-No information to tell you when you armor is broken (which may be important in some fights)\n-Stacking of some items is low (I'm not having a problem with that but when you can't place chests the way you want and the amount of items you can collect, this, sort of, becomes a problem)\n-Getting more than plenty of some items that are required in only one or few recipes (Bear claws, pelts, bones (well, this isn't a problem because logically is that every animal has them but just put it as an example), blood of the brood, etc.)\n\nSuggestions:\n- I would like to see the "Thirst bar" which would be another variable that you'd have to take care of (I don't know much about developers' plans for the future, but if there ever will be something like a desert type area this could come in handy; also this is just a personal suggestion which would fulfill me personally but others may hate it... it's a situational thing).\n-Many more weapons with different effects (elemental weapons (fire, ice, poison, etc.), more types of ranged weapons (throwable axes, daggers, more bows, crossbows, etc.)\n-Many more different armors (light, medium and heavy category)\n-Shields (same as armors, light, medium and heavy, also from different materials, etc.)\n-Collectable herbs to make something like potions (maybe something to give some buffs like increased staming, strenght (more damage and ability to wear harder armor without penalties)\n-Speed penalty while overburdened (this would make game much more realistic)\n-Many more creatures that can spawn both during day and night which will add variety and much more droppable items that can be used to craft new and different things (humanoid, beast, animal, undead, lizard, etc. Types)\n-Mounts that can ease your travel (whatever that may be)\n-Dungeons of some sort (Caves, temples, ruins, etc.)\n-This may not be taken well because some games have added this and had problems because of it, and I myself am also sceptic about this, but you should consider adding some type of skill factor based on the amount of time using some tool or weapons (sort of like adjusting to your weapons, armor, and anything else) that can make farming easier for you.\n-Agriculture, growing your own plants (whatever that may be) could add variety to the game.\n-More tools (such as pickaxes, hoes and so on)\n-More special creatures (such as Kur, Helion, Lycor) that have their stories and that can be a challenge\n-add some sort of guideline structure (road signs) and maybe some sort of a blank map that you can draw yourself (with some sort of ink maybe)\n-Not sure how you feel about this but it may be nice to, along with complete blueprints for structures, add something like walls that you can place in a way to build a bigger house with more room and some inner decorations (something like a tavern or a guard post).\n-Smelting would be nice since you could smelt all the things you don't use anymore and get some extra from them\n\nI usually don't rank things that are in alpha, beta state or pre release but just for the sake, subjectively I'd rate it (on a scale from 1 to 100) a solid 90+ because of not so many things in the current state, so not a big deal. Haven't experienced any specific bugs or glitches. Game is running solid and the graphic settings are various and on max settings the game is beautiful. I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes survival games.\n\nI know that you may be annoyed with all the „add more stuff“ and I know it's gonna be added but I had to say my word. I can't think of anything else at this moment but I'll be playing the game in the future and will see the further development. I also see that Developers are very interested in their community and listen to our suggestion, critics and commends. You guys do an amazing job and it has been my pleasure playing this game for more than 30 hours now and continuing into the future. Keep up the good work and if you want any more suggestion that I may think of in the future, I can always help you out.

Sure, it has a lot of content yet to be added, but the foundation that has been laid is quite extraordinary.\n\nPOSITIVES:\n\n1) Graphics - Very high quality, professional looking graphics and models\n2) Sense of Progression - This is what drives the player to keep playing, and they've done it well.  Collecting resources to craft better weapons and armor, build bigger buildings, and make larger packs to increase carrying capacity.\n3) Variety of Enemies - Skeletons, wolves, plagued wolves, forest giants, dire bears, furies.\n4) Size of Island - The size of the world is quite large.  After 60 hours I can't say that I've explored the entire thing.\n\nNEGATIVES:\n\n(Keep in mind that many of these negatives may very well be resolved as the game develops)\n\n1) Grinding - Collecting resources can become a chore, especially mining.\n2) Limited Resources - The resources in this game do not respawn, but that may change in the future.\n3) Cost of Repairs - Many of the higher end weapons and armor are so expensive to repair and the resources required to repair them may be scarce, especially if you have several players on your server.\n4) Base Building - Right now, it's so easy to strip an area of usable resources that there is no reason to spend time and resources on base building since you'll just have to move on anyways.\n5) Map Reloads - Once you've stripped most of the island of resources the only way to keep playing is to load a new map.  Fortunately, you get to carry your character to the new map, but anything you've built is gone forever.","November 3, 2015","true","60.8"," 51 of 63 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","51","63","2","4"

I think this is a good thing.\n\nWhile it's early access, most of the visuals are pretty good, with the exception of a few things that I would consider placeholders.\n\nThe combat is a bit wonky and clunky; the mobs have a melee range that is crazy.

Anyway, so I am freezing my butt off, and build a campfire. Nicely warmed up, I thought I would explore a little and get food. Some rags over my back and a axe made with a stone and a stick, I set off. Not for long. Off in the distance I could just make out the wings of something so massive it dwarf the mountain it seem to perch on. Back at the campfire and new set of pants, I head out in the other direction. After running after some deer with no success I came upon a abandoned village with only couple of wonky skeletal defenders. So I triumphantly claimed the village for myself...not for long. The skeletal warriors returned, armoured and with proper war axes. So back at starting point after not surviving one day, I am left to rethink and better plan my strategy for next attempt.\n\nSo next attempt....not for long. Thought I would see if there is seafood.

Moved to the beta branch around the 90 hr mark an havn't looked back. New content every time I load a map. This is one game that actually has good ninja updates with large and pre-announced weeklyish on the main loading screen. NPC's - Everything attacks on sight with a decent detection radius, blinding whiteout snowstorms, great graphic's, scaling enemies from pigs, bears, wolf packs, skellies, night furies, giants to a dragon [not implemented in beta yet] and really user friendly UI. There's no questline as of yet but just staying alive here keeps you on your toes, health, cold, stamina and hunger all need constant monitoring. Yea it's EA and beta so there's bugs but hey , what game doesn't have glitches here an there. and the thing is you can see them disappear on a daily basis, I have an old i5 and gtx560 which runs this fine.

If any developers are reading, I'd like to offer some constructive criticism. Conceptually this game is pretty unique, apart from the early access survival aspect. The atmosphere of waking up on the shore of a cold unforgiving island, plagued by undead creatures, and a dragon (which becomes ever so annoying once you realize it simply flies in circles for eternity) is truly awe-inspiring. Intrigued by the atmosphere you soon realize that there isn't much to offer upon exploring the crafting, combat, and building system. You will find yourself running back to the beach over and over trying to collect flint and other resources, which is very tedious. Simply, the game suffers from poor structure. I'm not sure if it is technical limitations caused by the game's engine, or the lack of experience from the developers. The map isn't big enough to leave any room for exploration, you simply spawn in and see what appears to be your main objective (the dragon). If you're going to leave this big of a gap in map design, atleast make it randomly generated. I recommend starting from scratch with the map, perhaps hire some new employees with the money generated from the Steam sale, maybe even invest in using a better game engine. It all just seems bland, next is combat; after interacting with some skeletons I discovered they had some sort of disability that allowed me to simply run to a safe distance, get a whack in and continue running. There needs to be a proper block and parry system, and more intelligent A.I. I hate to continue to bash, but I'm simply trying to conceptualize some ideas for the developers, so I can get my money's worth from this game. For example, the building. It's simply a bunch of pre-fabs, to build said pre-fabs you must go spam left click countless trees until you die of old age. After you've collected enough resources to build your desired structure, you simply spam "E" until this structure magically appears. (This system is similar to that of The Forest". Referring to the gathering of resources, perhaps players could create a lumber-mill of sorts allowing for increased productivity in wood gathering, and rather than running to the beach to collect flint, you could find nodes (these nodes should respawn eventually) scattered across the map. But, once again with the size of the map, after building your pre-fab riddened village of nothingness the wilderness becomes barren due to the lack of trees. Ultimately, this game needs a fresh-start. I do not intend to insult any developers, I simply would like to see this game to shine in the way it should.","November 26, 2015","false","6.2"," 75 of 111 people (68%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","68","75","111","6","5"

To. See. You.  DEAD.\n\n•There's a huge ♥♥♥ dragon that will wreck your ♥♥♥♥ if you don't watch out.\nAND the night's even more dangerous.\n\n•Now,besides all the monsters and wild animals that want to devour your mortal soul for whatever reason, there's yet the cold and hunger that you have to fight.\n\n•You HAVE to hunt and that pretty often, which means you can't just build a base and stay there,hoping for deer or something to pass by.\n\n•Your houses/leantons/fireplaces or whatever you use to scare off or fend against wild animals will soon be able to get wrecked too by mentioned monsters.\n\n•It's really hard to keep a good sense of orientation too, since you only have a little, pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ compass that you can craft and the dragon towers to set as markers, if you don't place down a totem or torch or whatever as "breadcrumbs".\n\nAll in all, for newcomers, this game's tough as nails without a dull end.\nAnd for those who know their way around in this game already, it'll become harder too, since there's a lot to come.\nIt's a refreshing challenge from all those easy games out there that just want to give you the feeling of satisfaction through unbattled superiority, which is not what a survival game is about.\nSavage Lands	 brings back the good ol' feeling of insecurity that keeps you alerted at all times,because you know that whatever might come around- it wants to kill you.\n\nThere's even that handy Countdown on the main menu that displays when the next update comes.\n\nThere are a few little bugs here and there and the servers are not yet working so well, but it's still in work, guys.\nIf you're too impatient to wait for it to be fixed and expanded,don't buy early access games.\n\n\nSummary\nGraphics- [7/10]\n•I've seen better, but there sure will be a lot of modders coming to give it HD patches etc.\nIt doesn't change that the game is fun.\n•Sometimes when you equip a chestplate, but don't have boots or gloves yet, your ankles and wrists are simply not there. And sometimes even your whole head is gone when you equip a helmet, so you have to relog to fix it.\n\nGameplay- [7/10]\nIt's early access,I know but I'm rating the game on it's current state.\n•The moveements tend to be a bit cluggy here and there.\n•It happens that you bug into the floor sometimes, so you have to walk up anything to get out of the floor and be able to jump again.\n•Super Air Launch when a wolf rushes at you sometimes.\n\nWorld- [6/10]\n•It's yet only forest,coasts, some abandoned villages/ruins and the dragon towers. It lacks some natural structures like caves or rivers. And some new biomes would be cool. The frosty and snowy forest tends to become boring after a while.\n\nBugs/Glitches- [7/10]\n•For an early access game,there are surprisingly few bugs and glitches. The ones I noticed so far are listed above in the gameplay and graphics part,since they only affect those parts of the game. Nothing gamebreaking.\n\nChallenge- [9/10]\n•Absolutely great. It's a fair but yet cruel world that will have you dieing very often at the start.

The only notable difference is you can team up with other players as you carve out a living in this world. The only negative issue about this game is the framerate. Unless you have a great PC rig, prepare yourself for a lot of lag and a lot of studdering about. I would like to add that the save system in this game is like the Long Dark, where there is none it is relied upon certain actions or exiting to the main menu, possibly when the days go by as well. (Now this part about the "save" feature, might change as well. If the developers decide to add a save feature).\n\nThe game also gives you a supplies list. For what you need in order to craft that particular object. (Now i say this now, but maybe the developers will get rid of this aspect in a future update. So this part of the review will probably change). This game isn't brutal like the Long Dark where every minute, second, hour could be your doom. But finding things in this world could take a while to find. So consider that to be your "every x could be your doom".\n\nThis game has modding potential. But in my opinion, if this game is tuned just right. You won't probably need mods for this game. Maybe translation mods, but not actual mods.\n\nThe developers like Hitherland Studios. Are very active and supportive of their fanbase. If you have any suggestions, issues, etc. Ask them and they will answers\n\n\nIf you love Hardcore survival games particuarly taking place in a fantasy setting.

Yes, I do recommend getting this game. Amazing progress has been made, and it's a pretty fun game. However, you have to keep in mind that this game is very much in the making, and while there are frequent updates, there are a lot of problems to.\n\nCurrently:\n-Great survival challenge. You are going to die. A lot.\nSometimes, however, these deaths are going to be annoying and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Wolves spawn endlessly right now at night, and if you aren't decked out in armor, and have a good weapon (or if you haven't just found a house), you are going to die a dozen times each and every night. Which wouldn't be so bad if you could make leather from wolf hides, but wolf hides are more a mid-tier item, useless when starting out. This is a bit easier to survive in multiplayer, but wolves are a mid-tier enemy that are almost impossible to avoid in early game.\n\n-Pretty decent balance\nOther than my gripes with the wolves, enemies are difficult but fair. You aren't intended to be able to take a giant down all by your lonesome. If you try to fight a bear with a stone sword, chances are you are going to die.\n\nThings I want:\nPlease, fix the wolf problem. This is ignorable if you are stocked with mid-tier to upper-lower-tier equipment, but endlessly spawning wolves is annoying. Having an aversion to fire would be a huge plus, and fairly sensible to boot.\nSpikes, walls or traps would be nice. Just a way to fortify your town/base. Even if it means that they are obsolete by the time you are able to craft them, just having them makes for nice asthetics.\nCraft leather from wolf hides. I often deal with leather shortages when starting out, and this would give a posotive to the endless waves of canine.\nStorage on crafting tables. Just give a few slots (even three would be nice) to store materials that are used commonly, and in bulk, like flint, sticks, or coal. Small things make things more fun to\nThe ability to crouch. I don't particularly care if it even does anything, but it would be nice if it did.\n\nAlso, there is currently a bug in the game were pressing esc sometimes resets your graphics, and if you die while looting your dead body, it will duplicate your items. Other than that, not to many bugs.\n\nOverall, I do like this game, and I think it has potential to be a pretty awesome experience. Even now, it's a decent play, and the frequent updates are a great thing.","April 3","true","19.2"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","25","29","0","0"

You'll be struggling to look for food, shelter, and assorted materials for crafting like most other survival games, but within an RPG setting. You'll be facing off against dire wolves, skeletons and dragons just to name a few.\n\nThe concept of melding RPG with survival seem so obvious, and being a fan of both genres, I'm happy to see Digital DNA taking a shot at it. The survival mechanics would be something I would compare to The Forest, chopping down trees, and crafting your own little village while fending off monsters. It pulls it off quite well, even at this early state of it being on Early Access. There are plenty of things to craft and a fair amount of wild life and monsters to hunt. While the survival aspect is done relatively well, the RPG elements that it tries to fuse does leave the player wanting. There's no XP to gain, not many stats to min-max, no story to speak of, or characters skills to customize. Basically if you're looking for an RPG experience, you might be disappointed. The best way to look at Savage Lands is to think of it purely as a survival game in an RPG setting.\n\nVisually it goes with a realistic aesthetic. It's not overly unique looking, but does the job. It does show a degree of graphic fidelity, as the landscape is well populated with foliage, and at certain time of the day, the lighting can impress. The game also shows a weather system and a day night cycle that's done pretty well as far as visuals are concerned. It's nothing too memorable, but it's not too hard on the eyes either.\n\nOverall, Savage Lands shows potential and is already quite playable. Mechanically it might not be the most original game in the world, but it is very competent in what it's trying to achieve. Don't go in expecting an RPG experience, instead, expect a survival experience and I think many would enjoy what it has to offer.\n\nPros:\n- Survival gameplay in an RPG environment can be very interesting to explore\n- Stable, playable, and enjoyable from right on launch\n- Lots to craft\n\nCons:\n- RPG elements are weak\n- Combat uninspired","March 5, 2015","true","6.0"," 83 of 130 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","83","130","2","5"

Very basic atm and plays like any other survival/crafting game.\n\n"Brutal Combat" -- it isn't. The only brutal thing about it is getting azzrammed by a pack of wolves that have longer reach than you do. Make the combat actually brutal. Blood effects are poor, the sounds aren't visceral, animations are sub-par (aren't even ragdolls lol) and all you do is click click click like Skyrim. C'mon guys this is called SAVAGE LANDS, make the combat SAVAGE. Add some mad combat effects like blood splatters and sick, bassy growls from the wolves, groans to the skeletons, give the dragon a roar, make me afraid to go out into the wild.\n\nAs for combat it really does feel like a basic Skyrim. You need a way to differentiate it combat gameplay wise otherwise if I wanted a repetitive click combat game with survival elements I'd just add a couple of mods to Skyrim and it'd be a more comprehensive game than this would ever be. Do something like Ryse or SoM, or even LoZ (each enemy has a weakness you need to exploit). Change it up for each creature. Wolves? Use a torch in one hand to keep them at bay while you swing with your weapon. If it's a pack, have them stay back growling and one jumps in to atack you every now and then. Skeleton? Aim for it's legs so it becomes slower and has less reach. etc.\n\nAll the weapons feel the same, too.\n\nAdd a crouch/prone option so that when you spot the dragon (or even other hostiles) you can lay down and not get spotted and rekt instantly, allowing you to wait for it to fly out of range. Make me feel like I'm actually trying to survive.\n\nAdd a realistic mode. Allow the players to select an actual 1:1 24 hour mode with hunger that takes a few hours to develop. This would be awesome and would actually make the game diffuclt in the right way. Instead of continuosly having to hunt, you can put it on the backburner and actually plan out exploring the wilderness so you don't get gangbanged by wolves.\n\nYou don't need a whole hand dedicated to a compass, either. Make it a hotkey, you press it and his left hand goes down and comes up with the compass untill you let it go or press the button again, at which point it goes back down and comes back up with whatever you had equipped before pressing the hotkey.\n\nAnimations are pretty crummy and it would be cool if you made enemies ragdoll upon death instead of those average death animations you have now that remind me of the horrible dragon death and spin death animations in Skyrim.\n\ntbh I was going to write way more, but I realised the chances of the game improving or being differentiated from other games is very unlikely.\n\ntl;dr: even if you want this game, don't buy it. Install some survival and realism mods in Skyrim, turn the difficulty up and play that instead while you wait to see if this becomes any good.","November 6, 2015","false","3.2"," 52 of 77 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","52","77","2","1"

The game has a lot of potential but right now it is frustrating to play. There is no map and when you die you lose everything. Finding your corpse again is bloody hard. When you die you lose everything so then you need to wander around till you find more equipment laying on the ground so you can start over. You can not build even the most basic equipment without killing a NPC which you can't do without equipment. A nasty catch 22. There is little to no help available on the game so its a matter of stumble around and try to figure stuff out on your own. Food is super scarce unless you can fight and kill NPC's and even then you get very little. The food itself does not fill you much and you end up eating the equivalent of about 2-3 wolves before you are full. Also most NPC's gang up on you. If you kill a wolf don't bother looting it a skeleton will be attacking you in seconds or another wolf.  Also items decay at a rediculas rate. You wear shoes and expect them to be gone in about 30 minutes play time. The same with all armor, tools and weapons.This is a real early release so I am hoping that some of these things will be addressed.\n\nI realised I mentioned all the negative stuff and its not all bad, the game really is fun to play when you actually get to play. I like the crafting though its very basic I am sure it will be fleshed out soon enough. I think if we could spend more time exploring the game it would be great. Maybe better players than I are able to do that. I am by no means a pro gamer. I just play for the fun of playing. I love games where you have to survive off the land so to speak but I do like the idea of being able to do more than just survive.\n\n\nJust know that it is so very early release that it is frustrating at times. If you are asking yourself if you should buy it. I say sure why not, if you have the cash go ahead and support the coding team and see how it goes. It has some amazing potential I can't wait till see how it turns out.","March 7, 2015","true","68.1"," 75 of 117 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","75","117","2","0"

There is currently a lack of any questing other than a page of to-do's that one should try when first arriving, but this only leads to the assumption that the devs are going to install some sort of purpose for the character for being on the island other than a marooning. most likely this will be a quest line and series of bosses.

Thing is, that I strongly doubt, the devs will be able to address all issues before calling it a day and releasing an unfinished product.\nAs of now, this is early access and here are the major points, why I started to hate this game:\n\n- Multiplayer:\nNot playable as of now. The game get's unplayable, once players starting to spread out - not to mention the odd process to configure a server.\n\n- Lack of depth:\nNo content, no challenges, just random deaths and a running simulator. Fun for an hour - pure suffering after that.\n\n- Bad game design:\nFighting/AI is not fun at all, loot- and inventory-design are more a joke than a feature, world is way too large and grinding is all you can do right now. If you die, it means, you have to get back to your corpse, which is most of the time a huge mess and can take forever, because you either freeze, starve or end up as a snack on the ten-hour march back to your corpse.\nOne day in the field and your equiment is completly destroyed and needs to be rebuild, which is okay in the beginning, but get's really annoying later on. Equiment should last way longer than it does right now. It feels like a mechanic to prolong the suffering through this game.\n\n- Bugs and crashes:\nThis is early access, I get it, but guys, really? There are graphic-bugs, before you even enter the main menu! I wanna keep it short, so I won't go into detail, but I could spend more time with bug reports than with game content.\n\n- Graphics:\nThere are a view highlights, like chopping down a tree or watching the dragon, but the rest of the game feels dead and lacks all kinds of detail. It feels like the devs stopped working on it at some point to reach out for money even sooner.\nAll in all I wanted this game to do well, but it didn't. It had a fair price during the sale, but it is weak compared with nearlly any other game of the survival genre.\n\nUpdate 1:\nI am really impressed by the response time of the dev team.\nIt seems like they really care and are trying hard to make the game better.\nRight now I don't like the current state of the game, but this game might have a bright feature, if the Dev team is willing to work hard on it!","November 8, 2015","false","13.6"," 29 of 39 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","29","39","0","2"

I was desperately in need of shelter and warmth and hunger was coursing through me.  I made my way along the beach picking up useful looking stones and pieces of timber as I went but the cold had numbed my hands and I was struggling to keep hold of more than a few items.\nIt seemed my luck might be returning when I stumbled upon an abandoned fire next to a crude shelter.  The fire had long since extinguished but the timbers which remained seem dry enough to light if I could find a way.  My fortune continued when I discovered a small stone hammer and axe lying next to the shelter.  With the hammer I managed to chip away some flint from a nearby boulder.  Sparks erupted as a struck the flint and finally faint wips of smoke emerged from some dry moss at the base of the fire.  I nurtured the tiny flames and soon they grew into a roaring fire.  Life flooded back into my body as the warmth embraced me.  I stayed next to the fire staring out across the ocean for a time but I knew that I couldn't stay here forever.  I had to keep moving, to find proper shelter and food.\nWith a heavy heart I left the fire and grimaced as the cold tore into me once again.  I walked for what seemed like hours without any signs of life when all of a sudden I caught a sharp movement up the hill to my left.  I hid behind a bush and watched as a deer emerged from behind some nearby trees.  In my weakened condition it would be a struggle to catch an animal such as this when it ran but a series of bushes allowed me to sneak close enough to launch an attack.  As I leapt from cover I muttered a prayer to the high father R'ahkselt asking for his guidance and protection.  My first blow landed true and stunned the beast which gave me the opening I needed.  I rained down a succession of strikes with my axe and soon the deer collapsed dead.  I scavenged the corpse which provided me with plenty of meat and some leather hide.  I carefully extracted the sinewy tendons for when dry these would make adequate binding materials.\nUnfortunately I was not the only hunter that day.  As I was finishing up with the corpse I heard a snarl from behind me.  I barely had time to turn before a ravenous wolf fell upon me.  It was all I could do to raise my arm so that his teeth which were for my neck, instead sunk into the flesh of my forearm.  I struck the creature several blows to the head with the axe in my free hand and it soon shared the fate of the deer it had been stalking.  Using some cloth I had picked up on the beach I managed to bind my wound and stop the bleeding.  The wolf carcass provided me with yet more meat and hide, a fair trade for the wound it had inflicted.\nThe adrenaline coursing through me had blinded me temporarily to the cold but it soon set into me again with a vengeance.  The dense foliage around me made me wary of further wolf attacks so I turned back towards the shore and started clambering down the hill.  I was almost to the water when a clacking sound stopped me in my tracks.  From behind a nearby boulder emerged what I thought was a man but as I watched I realised that this man had long since lost the flesh from his body.  A skeleton, an animated corpse.  What kind of fel place had I been stranded?  It seemed to have not noticed me and knowing nothing of how to fight the undead I decided to sneak away.  Was this a freak occurance or was this land infested with more of these shambling horrors?  I was certain I would find out if I lived long enough.\nAfter walking along the coast for a time I found the ruins of a small stone hut, the roof which had long since decayed.  Even so this offered more protection and shelter than anything else I had found so I decided to make it my home, at least for the night as I noticed the Sun was rapidly setting over the distant horizon.  I set about gathering wood from the trees around the hut and soon had another fire warming me.  I cooked the meat of the deer and wolf I had killed earlier and vigorously tore into it, satiating my hunger for the time being.\nThe darkness had now set in completely and I dared not venture away from the fire.  At night the freezing conditions had worsened and who knows what manner of beast was lurking in the shadows.  Perhaps the fire would keep them at bay...perhaps.  Some time later a noise startled me and I leapt up, axe in hand.  A shadow approached but when the light of the fire bathed the figure I was relieved to see that it was nothing more than a deer.  I relaxed and welcomed her to my home since it would need be a good idea to go chasing a deer through the forest at night.  Unfortunately the deer was not alone.  She had innocently come to investigate my fire not knowing that she was being followed.  I had only just sat back by the fire when the wolf leapt from the shadows towards me.  The deer bolted into the darkness leaving me alone to deal with this rotten carnivore.  As he bore down on me I managed to kick out and knock him away but in doing so I fell towards the fire and burned myself.  As I cried out in pain he leapt again but I rolled aside and took up my axe.  We circled one another for he was wary now and not so eager to attack.  In a moment of madness I charged forward swinging my axe in a huge arc which cleaved into the beasts shoulder.  He howled with pain and rage and bit into my leg as I pulled my axe from his flesh and struck again with a final killing blow.\nI slumped back breathing heavily and assessed the wound on my leg.  Luckily I had some cloth scraps left over from earlier and managed to apply them as a makeshift bandage.  I had no idea of the time but it was still pitch dark with no sign of the morning light arriving to comfort me.  This truly was a savage place and I found myself questing my resolve to survive here alone.  No.  I must remain resolute.  The dawn would arrive soon and with it new opportunities.  Surely there must be a settlement here where I could find aid?  A howl in the distance. More wolves.  Another howl much closer this time.  Snarls from the darkness surrounding me.  I pick up my axe and look all around.  There was still no sign of dawn.\n\n'You survived for 1 day'\n\nTL:DR\n\nPicked up some rocks and sticks.  Killed a deer.  Killed a wolf.  Made a fire. Killed another wolf.  Got killed by more wolves.\n\n10/10 will get killed by wolves again.\n\nI suppose on a serious note it's worth saying that this game is very much an alpha so don't expect polish and tons of content.  What there is seems decent though.  Animations and combat are a little clunky but the foundations are there.  Crafting and gathering mechanics are pretty solid.  The survival aspect of this game is brutal, at any given moment either the cold, hunger or bloody wolves (or worse) are trying to kill you.  If you're unlucky all three at the same time.\n\nTip of the day - don't run into the Sea.","March 13, 2015","true","4.6"," 35 of 50 people (70%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","70","35","50","11","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/volt615/recommended/307880/","volt615","Volt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/volt615/","405 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe GoodSavage Lands is an early access game that has a lot of potential, just as many games in EA do.  The game is already playable and enjoyable to some extent if you like a great challenge. The crafting system is well implemented giving you a wide variety of items to craft such as food, clothing, armor, weapons, and enough building designs for a small town if you can live long enough to gather all of the materials. The graphics look decent, not great.  The hands and the animation for eating need some attention. The gameplay is smooth for the most part and I did not run into any bugs during my time in game which hasn't been much.  The enemy AI also seems decent from what I have experienced so far.\n\nThe BadHowever, the game is plagued with the same faults that plague many survival games.  Savage Lands currently requires that you gather items at such a high rate due to hunger, cold, sickness, & injury that neither your desire to explore nor build is satisfied due to you ultimately meeting your doom if you choose to do anything other than search for supplies. Did I mention that you start naked so as you can imagine, inventory management is also an issue.\n\nNote to the DevsThis game has a lot of potential. Howevr, I would like to see the following changes so people have a chance to explore, craft and enjoy this game as pve or pvp without the constant grind of resources being so vital. If the game presents itself as to much of a grind, people will be less like to play it after initially burning out on the contant grind for supplies. So making small changes could improve the gameplay experience while keeping the survival element in place to present a challenge other than the enemy AI and other players.\n\nFirst, the need to eat greatly reduced. People can go several days without food and water.  You should not need to eat every few mins to stay at peek stats. Every 30 mins to an hour would be more reasonable. Keep the need to eat more in line with other survival titles so people have more to do than just focusing on eating or building fires which leads to my next area for improvement.\n\nNext, the element of the cold environment which truely makes this game challenging, needs to be less harsh. For example, you become susceptible to illness which deteriorates your health at a slower rate, lets say 10-20 mins, rather than dying a few mins after hitting 0 on your cold meter if you can't get to or build a fire in time and get rest. Also, the torch should provide some warmth and so far as I can tell at the moment, it either does not or does very little.  If the cold is so severe in this environment, I would think we would have been better equipped upon being ship wrecked there.  Granted, so long as you have a hammer and an axe, building a fire is not too difficult, but my point is the current design is a bit much to truly enjoy the experience I believe is hinding in plain sight.\n\nLast, servers period.  I did not see any servers in the menu when I started my game so I hosted my own.  This may have been a bug but during my hour and a half of gameplay I did not have anyone join me.  This could have been due to firewalls, but honestly I do not know it the current build even allows one to join others accross the net.  Servers are needed for people to enjoy this game for co-op and pvp.\n\nFinal VerdictI do recommend this game if you want a challenge and  understand this game is in EA and may turn out to be great or a great disappointment. Otherwise wait for the game to go on sale as I did or for the finished game prior to buying.","August 4, 2015","true","1.8"," 30 of 44 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","30","44","4","1"

Therefor make sure you know what this means and implies before buying this game!\n\nI am happy to see that this game gets a 'very positive' response in the reviews, but I also notice a lot of complaints, negativity, opinions without proper explanation and more on the forums, Live streams and other media. This is a shame and in my opinion totally not needed. This game is certainly not finished yet (Alpha says it all), may contain bugs, could be unbalanced, lacking content and whatever else needed before this game may or may not become a final release. Taste differs as well, so you may or may not like this game, so be it.\n\n\nPersonally I love survival games, but I would like to see a certain degree of difficulty as well which I feel many of the similar 'survival' games tend to lack. I found this game through a reddit post and it right away caught my attention. I looked into it some more and certainly liked what I saw and read about this game. Then I got lucky to receive a key to try the game just before Early Access release on Steam and as a 'tester' felt obliged to actually test and report any issues.\n\nSo far I have been really enjoying this game as is, knowing it is still in early stages. The atmosphere is very good with the graphics, environment, sounds, weather conditions, (mostly hostile) animals and creepy monsters. Menus and overall GUI is pretty good and I love the unlocking system for new items to craft as you progress in the game. It is hard to survive in those conditions in this environment and forces you to pay really good attention to many things. The game does feel intuitive and logical most of the times. Gathering resources next to staying alive is pretty tough at first, often learning the hard way but certainly possible. My first impression is certainly very positive and I like where this is going according to the developers and discussion with the community. The involvement of the developers with the community is great and worth mentioning when it comes to a game that is still in its alpha stages.\n\nHowever, at the moment a lot of content has yet to be implemented. Many bugs still need fixing and balance sure needs some tweaking here and there. The environment can use more variety and villages look pretty damn similar. This would make it easier to figure out your location in the world without the need of a map (please no, it's survival after all). The fighting and animations with it can use some improvement. Being able to abuse death without losing anything needs fixing. At the moment, I have pretty much seen it all (apart from the Tree creature) and been able to craft all after plenty of hours put into this game with great enjoyment.\n\nI would sure recommend this game if you are into tough survival and like where this game seems to be heading. It is however far from finished yet, keep that in mind. Make sure to post any issues/bugs as well as suggestions, join the discussion, because we are also part of what this game may become.  Although no certainty, the future seems to look great!","March 9, 2015","true","827.3"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","23","32","0","0"

And still in early access too with new updates very often and always big ones. I think it is worth investing in this survival game and I hope to see the final product as it will be amazing. The strong points are the combat and crafting combined to become the best survival game I have come across (Dayz didnt have crafting). And the graphics on the massive open worlds are amazing even on my PC (which is kind of average). It is especially fun if you can join a server that lets you spawn stuff to cheat and build a castle then just kill noobs who join and don't know anything.\nWould rate 9.5/10. Some things can be worked on but it is early access so what do you expect and is being updated monthly with new content and patches.","September 19, 2015","true","4.3"," 32 of 50 people (64%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","64","32","50","10","4"

I spent less than $10 on this, it is early access, and I am 2 hours in at this time.\n\nIn the first 2 hours, if you stick close to the (safer) beach spawning point like I did, you will likely:\n- Build your first fire pit, which doubles as a crafting location\n- Gather resources (stones, chop trees etc.)\n- Learn to create and repair weapons and some clothing\n- Fight and kill your first boar or deer\n- Build your first house structure, which offers a little protection and warmth\n- Begin to starve, which forces you to venture into the interior before you are fully ready\n- Die, either by cold, starvation or creature... as you realize too late you need more food\n- Respawn, and live again, wiser this time (and better equipped, if you can find and loot your old body)\n\nDuring all that time, there was a constant feeling of being watched by creatures that lurked further into the island - and a sense that sooner or later survival and wunderlust would force you toward those dangers. If you have played The Long Dark, this game likewise will not let you get comfortable for long.\n\nCrafting is on the whole is satisfying so far (multiple things to make to achieve the same purpose). Artwork, physics, and performance seemed quite good for early access. I have not tried multiplayer, but I assume that will add layers of fun.\n\nAt $5 per hour (so far, and that number will go down) easily one of the better purchases I've made. Looking forward to seeing this one develop further.\n","September 15, 2015","true","13.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","1"

Core survival mechanics are implemented, which is more than enough to make the game worth the cost of admission.\n\nCombat and construction are still rudimentary, so if you're looking for Skyrim-style sword and board or some kind of world-builder, this title is not (yet) for you.\n\nOtherwise, gathering, crafting and resource use are already well balanced and compliment the game's style elegantly.  Lore and atmosphere are starting to bloom from interesting to compelling, fuelled by an active community and responsive developer (Signal Studios).\n\nCompared to other players in the genre, this game is satisfyingly difficult.

Despite stating in one of the patches that campfires can now be relit, theres nothing to suggest thats possible in-game...this is likely one of the things they should add to the tutorial, because i'm sure i'm not the only person who was standing, staring at the campfire, trying to relight it with everything I had in my inventory.\n\nDeer and the like are now easier to kill, you'll still have to run around in a potato sack for clothing and a half-broken stone axe instead of a bow to kill them, its just faster now, I think wolves have less health and deal less damage (I forgot most of the patch notes pretty easily) hard to tell the difference honestly, even harder to tell when you're actually injured, given theres no animation or recoil for when you're actually damaged, though your eyes start bleeding when you hit about 30% health, so theres that.\n\nAll in all the game is starting to make things a little easier for the starting gamer, and after a couple hours I finally found a town, only to have my face bitten off by a zombie dog.

Instinct takes over, my heart rate and respirations increase, my arm muscle swells with the rush of oxygentated blood, adrenaline courses through my body as I release the stone at a roughly 40 degree angle.\nWhat followed is something that will effect me forever in this world, I will never forget the sound of that stone impacting the poor animals skull, or the gutteral painfilled screams proceeding, screams that cut deeper than the cold ocean breeze. I stood paralyzed as I watched the elk run off into the foilage, disapearing as if just a dream all along..a lesson to us all.\nA vow was taken that day, one that will never be expunged from my soul, I am now a protector of sorts, and here is my proclomation : "ALL YEE WHO ENTER MY LANDS TO SEEK TO CAUSE HARM TO ITS INHABITANTS SHALL FACE THE UNBRIDDLED WRATH OF MY BULGE"\n\nI do one last inventory check before my body freezes over, a new permenant fixture and warning to all who walk in my steps.\n\nFrozen ponytail - Check\nFrozen crotch bulge - Check\nIntegrity - Check\nHonor - Check\nJustice - Check.\n\n9/10 - Potatoes?\n\nEdit 1/16/2016 : Mature filter discovered\n\n10/10 (new updated score)","January 12","true","27.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","79","11","14","9","0"

The recommended may not always apply but when my pc completely surpasses said recommended hardware and still struggles to run you have a large problem.\nI have 6gb of memory and this game completely maxes it and that is whats bottlenecking it, cpu 45% usage and gpu 60% usage. Low and high graphics make no difference in framerate, only render distance does. God forbid you set launch options to "-force d3d9" because that can cause your sky to turn completely pink and sometime flicker.\n\nOh yea, the game right, not my problems.\n\n=-=-=Pros=-=-=\n-Games graphics are highly flexible and an amazing amount of options for personalization.\n-Actual difficulty, There is an actual amount of scaling in this game, I doubt you'll goto late game with a stone sword or some ♥♥♥♥, you have to build yourself up to take on the battle.\n-Dedicated multiplayer servers.\n-Special Enemies to spice up your life a bit rather than fighting wolves every 5 seconds, you might find a devourer or something of the like.\n-Alot of items to make to give a bit of personalization.\n\n=-=-=Cons=-=-=\n-Combat system has little to no depth, you swing, the enemy swings, whoever does more damage wins. that simple.\n-Crafting system is ridiculously easy and gathering materials is tedious.\n-Probably nobody is going to read this, pretty much no point for me to write this other than i'm bored. (unrelated)\n-Recommended requirements is currently nowhere near what it states, since it's early access thats due to change but with the large amount it's off by it's almost invalid.\n-It can be quite a grind, especially when you can lose everything so fast and have to start over.\n\n\nDo I recommend it? If you want a survival game that is somewhat different and is constantly being updated sure. If you plan to play it alone and expect AAA performance and story and expansive continents or some ♥♥♥♥, no. I highly recommend you play with a friend to get some enjoyment out of surviving rather than dying every 5 seconds.\nThanks for reading if you got this far, you've probably got nothing else to do either than waste about 5 minutes of your life reading a steam review.","April 21","true","43.8"," 27 of 44 people (61%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","61","27","44","13","7"

Graphics are beautiful.\n\nThis is an Early Access Review\n\nGame could be improved by:\n- adding new/more diverse enemies\n- tightening up the craft menu (perhaps searching/filtering by ingredient)\n- tightening up combat\n- adding things to build, like a CASTLE!!!\n- allowing you to tear down a structure you have built, getting a portion of the materials back\n- allowing you to complete structures you happen upon, like stone houses\n- ability to build walls (ensuring you can connect them to existing walls)\n- ability to craft traps\n- weapons with more reach (great for slow enemies like skeletons)\n- maybe a hotbar with more than 5 slots\n- revise the armor, either reduce materials or increase durability (wolves shouldnt scratch my metal armor)(i know this is coming in an update, i hope it works out well)\n- i havent seen any boars or bears, are they implemented?\n- farming... my diet of meat only can't be good for my GI tract.\n- ensuring that all houses connect to the ground on all sides, so my stuff doesn't roll out the bottom gap\n- DUAL WIELD! two axes would be a great way to make sure wolf is what's for dinner.\n- ability to reignite torches\n- ability to destroy things permanently (instead of building a house to keep all the skulls in)\n\nBut yeah, i dont even really like survival games, but this one is quite fun for you and a few friends.","March 23, 2015","true","13.3"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

Granted, I only wandered around for about an hour, but in that time I completed every item on the "beginner checklist", and then went on to make a base and hunt quite a few different enemies.\n\n- The building system, crafting system, and the map are all complete rips from The Forest.  An exact copy.\n- The art isn't great - it looks like old Unity 4 graphics, before Unity spent time working on PC shaders.\n- The animations also aren't great - they look like they were bought from an asset store.\n- The AI is incredibly simple and lifeless.  Every enemy in the game walks up to you, waits 2 seconds, then attacks.  It repeats until one of you die.\n- The inventory system is painful to work with.\n- There are no other features in the game that I can think of.  I crafted armor, weapons and food, I built structures, and I explored and killed enemies.\n\nI'm not going to reference all the bugs and odd game design choices (like spawning an advanced weapon next to where I first spawned) since it's Early Access.  The graphics and the animations I can also get over since it's Early Access (though the developers behind this game aren't indie and won't improve either category before launch, I applaud them for taking advantage of this marketing tactic).\n\nHowever, the outright stealing of not only the concept but the implementation of this game's core features (building, crafting, map) is appaling.  I don't see any way for this game to rise above the other 400 piles of crap that have hastily flooded the 'Survival' genre looking for easy money.\n\nThe first response to this might be "well you haven't tried playing online with others - that's where the fun is."  Why would I want to repeat what I just did with others?  It's still the same crap AI, stolen building and crafting systems, and empty, desolate environment where the fog is so heavy you can't see more than 20 meters in any direction?  Why does the developer need to rely on my wanting to kill another player (or build something with him) in order to have fun?  Bottom line, I'll go play ARK or Rust or The Forest or one of the other 400 Survival games that have done all these things much better.\n\nEven though this is Early Access, no developer is going to fundamentally change all of their core features prior to "launch".  I expect almost no changes or additions to this game for a long, long time.","November 5, 2015","false","4.4"," 113 of 205 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","113","205","4","23"

Why give the option to respawn when you respawn miles away from your corpse or camp.  You actually have to delete the world and start over every time you die and since everything is Random you may do that a hundred times just to finally get rolling and then have a group of Skeletons come and kill you.\n\nWait until this gets more stuff done.

The crafting system is simplistic yet lengthy when making large projects. You have the option to play alone, play with friends, host a game or invite only. You can make a bloodbath of a PvP game or you can set it to be friendly and build a community together! This game has a Skyrim feel with the lurking death of the elements and wild beasts around every corner! I must say I am taken by this game and will be playing more! I am excited to see what updates are to come in the near future!

I do not. Not even close.\n\nThere is no customizable character options. Sure, lets be a bald white man! Thats what I always choose when I play games. Although to be honest, this is something I could live with if some of the other issues were addressed. The graphics for your character are pretty retro though I must say. Which leads me into my next statement ....\n\nThe graphics do not look even close to the screen shots above and it lags horribly even with a pretty up to date build. Perhaps this is something that will be rendered over time as more updates come but for the price its just dissapointing at the moment. I would also love to see come controller support.\n\nThe check list they provide at the beginning of the game is pretty basic to start off. I guess it is supposed to be a tutorial of sorts although I didnt find it helped me in the slightest.Just the usual stuff was on it, go find tree, cut down tree, find stone .... and so on. I couldnt even find a single deer to hunt and I searched the island for at least 30 mins.No check mark for me.\n\nI did find some sort of village with zombie skeletons whom I assumed were trying to attack me but got stuck behind a fence until I walked over and bashed them to death with my axe/mallet. I would love to see some better NPCs and battle mechanics. Perhaps some defending, crouching, sprinting, anything else really. After defeating my fearsome foes I was hoping I could loot some goods but alas all the buildings were pretty  much empty of all goods and decorations. Just "wooden" boxes. Very cookie cutter. :(\n\nThis game has so much potential and I want to see it come to life.

What a fun game!  This game has enormous potential!  Even in it's current Early Access state it is really FUN to play and has a lot of content to mess around with.  I felt like I was playing a new Elder Scrolls game with a rogue-lite twist! It's pretty awesome IMO and works great! :-)  It is a very atmospheric game!  Checkout my screenshot right before sunset:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=452300583\n\nIn just my first hour of playing, I  setup camp.  Went exploring and gathered supplies.  Crafted some items and weapons.  Found a deserted town.  Killed two skeletons, saw some huge flying creature atop a tall black tower.  Then I ran from two skeletons! lol   Didn't get away and died!  Respawned and looted my dead body.  I got everything back that I lost and the random loot in the area had respawned!  Savage Lands is really FUN to play!  The game name suits it perfectly!\n\nI fully recommend Savage Lands to anyone that likes this new genre of survival game!  It is really fun in it's current EA state and will only get better!  It shows signs of professionalism and these dev's mean business!  The game Rocks!  If you have been following Savage Lands and have thought of getting it... Don't think any longer! Buy it! You won't be sorry.  I'm very happy! :-)\n\nThe game runs silky smooth on my iMac at full 2560x1440 resolution!

It's a really hard game in single player.  You're constantly gathering supplies!  You also need to keep a fire going in a camp somewhere near by or you'll die from the cold.  You also eat like a freaking elephant and need food every 5 minutes!  You're constantly dying from either hunger, cold or both.  It's pretty hard IMO.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kimberly3d/recommended/307880/","kimberly3d","Kimmiebear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kimberly3d/","45 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nRevised Statement:  The game has been upgraded to be much more playable.  I think the developer listens to us and really is working hard to make this better and better!  Thank you to the developers!!!\n\nGame Start Up Time:  I have to say it was good until I tried to join someones server and there I sat for a while.  So I started my own.\n\nSurvival/Crafting:  Definately is a sandbox crafting survival game.  Don't expect others to feed you because there is not much food to go around, you need to get out there and chase some deer down.  Playing with others did help because a lot of people shared what they could.  We all helped each other.  You practically need others as the game is that hard.\nPlease can we have a basic club to start with.  Getting Sinew is so hard in the begining.\n\nSettings:  There are plenty of settings to help you scale the game up or down to your computers capabilities.  I was a bit amazed that I had to turn the settings down as I am running a Mac/Windows Dual Boot with 16 GB Ram and a Solid State Drive.  At the higher settings it was very laggy for me.  Most games do not do that to my machine.  So I hope you have a decent machine or are willing to turn the settings way down.  That being said I have overloaded my comptuter with Game Development and 3D Graphic Software so maybe it is a bit overloaded with programs and it may have nothing to do with the game, just being honest.  Daytime nighttime is not settable but I wish I had more control over how long night lasts, it's really long and I hate nighttime, you freeze too much so you can do very little during that time.\n\nPlay:  Yes it is playable but be prepared to die a lot.  Basically I played all day and accomplished very little due to dying a lot.   I was glued to the game since it was so fricking hard to survive and to my medival brethren who joined me in suriving the harsh weather and we all were whining about how hard it was to survive but secretly all hoping they really put some more work into this game because it has a lot of potential.  I was able to get a large group of people together and we build a makeshift town at the beach.  It has a really great potential to be as good as say 7D2D "but" it does need to be updated to be more fair and more accurate especially regarding materials and weapon durability as currently they are very unfair and not very lucrative making the game painfully difficult.  Having lots of players does make it a bit harder to get some resources but I know the developers will hopefully improve the resources.  Especially food needs to be more resourceful.  I died so much from hunger and cold.\n\nLag:  There was a small amount of lag, but all in all I was able to serve the game easily to about 8 players with small amounts of lag from time to time on my mac with a dual boot of windows.  It was served on the windows side of things.\n\nEnvironment:  Top notch, very pretty, beautiful water effects, beautiful landscape and buildings, very difficult to see past clouds, smoke, etc.  Really gorgeous and somewhat like Skyrim.  The buildings are really nice and unique and it was fun everytime we finally did accomplish building something.\n\nBuilding:  Building is fun but hard because the bigger buildings require so many materials however lots of players will work together if you open a server.\n\nCharacters:  There is only a male character so far, he looks great, armor can be made or won for him but mostly we all ran around naked in a loincloth because nothing lasts long on this game or you lose it really fast.  I would really like to see a female character made.  You lose everything when you die...good luck finding your body.  Not sure about the dragon yet, he has not attacked me but he does fly around so keep your eyes up!\n\nCrafting:  Crafting already has a lot of recipes and I liked everything I saw "but" crafting is near impossible as it is near impossible to get much done or saved at all.\n\nLoot:  Everything you get is at risk when you die, which is like really often but it is fun to steal other peoples loot when they die and when they spend all day finding it and you see them come back and it's gone, you at least help them by giving them their hammer back haha.\n\nTools:  Need work on making them produce more or making them last longer.  Nothing lasts long and it is a BEAR trying to survive.  When they said Savage lands they meant it.\n\nInterface:  Very nice, kudos for a nice looking interface but we need a loot all button, come on people it takes forever to move your junk from your dead body to your new body.\n\nBots:  There are plenty of wolves, deer and skeletons around to fight, hunt and the like.  I did see a bear but never got to him.  Deer are skittish but can be gotten with some work.\n\nSurvival:  Your life sucks to be the character in this game, it is very, very hard work to survive.  I almost felt like saying I hate this game a thousand times but honestly I really liked it.  I know eventually they will pull it together and make it perfect.  But until then I will hate it and love it because of it's current state.  I really felt dissapointed at the current state of how hard it was to survive.\n\nOver all, I think it is worth the money if they continue to upgrade and work on the game.  I loved it and it was really something I would love to play again and again if it were tweaked and tuned better.  I hope to see more content added in as it is pretty fun!\n\nMY personal review:\n\nGame: 6/10\nScenery: 10/10\nCharacter Development:  5/10 (hope to see a story line develop - and hey lots of us gamers are girls - we need a girl model)\nCrafting: 7/10\nSurvival: 5/10 (needs work - its very difficult)\n\nKudos to the programmers, they are doing a great job!

I have been looking for a Co-op game like this to play with a friend, so we both took a chance on it......and we love it! This game has major potential provided that the devs listen to the community and do not sell out to any big companies.\n\nComplaints:\n\n1. It becomes extremely laggy when looking at fire and when getting close to the ocean.\n\n2. When hunting the doe, they lag forward and backwards and become unto a reindeer and fly up into the sky.\n\n3. The crafting for the armor is a bit much for as little as you get when you mine for it. My friend and I mined for about half an hour and still did not have enough to make armor.\n\n4. When you are chasing the deer they can run into the ocean, extremely far into the ocean to where you cannot get them. I died once trying to chase one into the ocean and because when you look at the water it becomes laggy I died trying to get back to land.\n\n5. One of the funniest things happened when we were attacked by a bear. But even that had its problems. The bear was incredibly laggy and jumping every which way, it caused our frames to drop VERY low and made it difficult to run let alone fight the bear. And finally, the bear is horribly overpowered; one hit from it took more than half of my health.\n\nApprovals:\n\n1. This game is like a crossover between Skyrim, Minecraft and The Forest. The crafting system is very in depth and makes sense unlike other games of this genre.\n\n2. There is no, or very little, lag when playing in a Co-op server which is very, very nice.\n\n3. The huge world size and all the things you can do in this game with it only being in alpha.\n\n4. The homes you can build, although that needs some work, are quite adequate\n\nRecommended Additions:\n\n1. There should a long range weapon of some sort, a bow or slingshot would be preferable, I would press for both additions as slingshots would be a pretty nice addition and do not really get much use in video games.\n\n2. Maybe a mount of some sort?\n\n3. A Dungeon system that you could explore and find loot.\n\n4. The ability to place fire pits or have a fireplace inside the homes you build.\n\n5. A way to find friends in a Co-op game mode\n\nAll in all this game is one of the only games I have paid over 5 bucks for in about 2 years and I would happily do it again. I only played for around 2 hours and can tell that this will become a favorite.\n\nAs a plea to the game devs, please do not add any DLC that adds to the game in momentous proportions or give other players an advantage over each other. Other than that this game has my support as of now.\n","March 5, 2015","true","3.5"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","15","23","3","0"

Having said that, if you've played a survival game recently then you know exactly what you're in for and Savage Lands doesn't really do anything new. I wish there wasn't just a yes or no recommendation for this game because your tolerance for this kind of genre will make or break whether or not you enjoy the game overall.\n\nIt's basically the same thing we've seen a hundred times, you chop down trees, collect wood, stone, food, etc and try to survive as long as possible. Crafting requires a lot of resources and they're not all that easy to come by.\n\nThe setting feels like something out of the Elder Scrolls series but the combat is extremely simplistic. I killed wolves and skeletons and saw a Dragon in the distance but froze to death before I could reach it.\n\nIf you're looking for another game to spend a few dozen hours getting lost in, then there are worse games out there.\n\nFull video review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x8CZWeIXPU","March 11, 2015","true","3.3"," 43 of 76 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","43","76","4","0"

They have a weekly stream and engage with the community.\n\nEnough Waffle on to the game\n\nOk this has a very solid singleplayer experience that has not been done before it has the PVE element of 7 days to die matching the difficulty level too it is  a steep learning curve but there are plenty of guides out there to assist coupled with the island feel of the Forest but it has so much more depth with changing weather patterns , different beasts and monsters & ruins to explore.\n\nThe Co op element is also fairly solid there are know bugs and glithces but like I said its early Alpha they are getting fixed. There is a huge emphasis on working together to take down monsters and generally survive in the harsh environment , larger buildings require tons of materials that are easily gathered in a group.\nPVP is something that will be added later to the game.\n\nFor an Early access title this is one of the more completed games & the Devs have a clear roadmap where they are going.  It is very affordable at its current price but will increase in time so snap it up now people.\n\nWhat can we look forward too in future?\n\nLore is being introduced , dungeons & magic mentioned and multiple islands\n\nI dont know about you but i`m going full on viking "To Valhalla"\n\nOh & it has dragons","March 6, 2015","true","59.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The crafting system while basic is robust and the environments generic but enjoyable. There's a real sense of immersion when you're all gathered around your fire trying to get warm from the cold or fending off enemies as a team. I play with 5 other people so as I have to host the game can be a little laggy despite my good connection as there's no dedicated servers yet.\n\nCombat is pretty basic with left mouse to attack and with bows that you simply have to draw and aim but there is still a slight degree of skill required. A block system in my opinion is sorely needed due to the gameplay type but it's still good enough for you to find satisfaction.\n\nEnemies vary and the AI is simple but effective in what you want from a game at this stage.\n\nPerformance of the game isn't bad though I notice my friend who plays on a macbook pro suffers from low FPS. It's not optimised and there's a lot of obvious tearing in the distance if you get to a high enough vantage point.\n\nAll in all I'd recommend it as a good co-op experience but until there's more variety in crafting and persistent servers for people to play on i'd say the single player element is rather average.","November 11, 2015","true","33.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Here in a few months, if the game is where it should  be, it will get a 10 out of 10 but as for now it feels like late Alpha moving towards Beta and that's perfectly fine)\n\nSome bugs? Yes\nLearning Curve? Yes.\nMost importantly this game is FUN! Haven't  played it with friends or a random server yet.\n\nLet's be clear SL is very hard and if you die it feels like a real set back. But for every food item gathered, every weapon crafted   and building Built , this feels like  "real" accomplishments and vicrtories.  That all being said, that's why I love it! It's not holding my hand, it makes you think and work Learning from your mistakes and surviving another night is a reward itself.\nAs for any Reviews bashing the team working on this. just ignore them. I've bought and played many games at a much higher  price tag, that didn't have half the content or a quarter the fun. Also, please ignore anyone with 0.3 hours in any game talking ♥♥♥♥ about  how bad a game is.

You will die, get over it!   Also watch for the Dreaded Tree DEER.    HAVE FUN!!!\n\n\n\nNote: When a game or product is in early access, that means it's not finished, it's going to be buggy, lacking in content and not fully fleshed out.

At the time, it was only $15 rather than $25. I looked through the screenshots and video and my first reaction was "Wow this game looks like Skyrim and Minecraft combined. And it has multiplayer!" I told my friends about it and they thought the same thing. So we all decided to buy it and jumped right into the game. After playing the game for awhile, here are a list of pros and cons I have noticed.\n\nPros:\n-VERY fun playing with friends.\n-In game chat (a pro but you will want to use TeamSpeak or Skype instead).\n-Quite a large world already\n-Graphics are great for early access (if you have a powerful computer).\n-Variety of weapons, armor and misc craftables.\n-Crafting is straightforward and simple.\n-A challenge many games don't have.\n-Mulitplayer is easy to set up/join.\n-Create your own spawn point.\n-Characters and their items transfer across all servers.\n-Real fight for survival.\n-Searching for materials doesn't feel very tedious.\n-Shelters protect you from unwanted visitors.\n-Dragon!\n-Many updates and fixes to come.\n\nCons:\n-Poorly optimized currently.\n-Random spawm points (sucks when you want to find friends on a new server).\n-The best armor wears away quickly when attacked.\n-Lag spikes when many enemies or items are in the area.\n-No map to speak of.\n-Deer run into the ocean.\n-Haven't been killed by the dragon.\n-Game crashes randomly.\n-No real use for shelters yet.\n\nI recommend this game in the current state it is at for the $15 I paid for it. However, I would wait for more updates to be released to feel like you got $25 worth of content. Definitely convince your friends to play it or else you might get bored/lonely.\n\n7/10 currently, but I believe this rating will go up as more updates are released.","March 14, 2015","true","19.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

The game should be free to  $5  max  and all or anything to do put out that is already out there in every  EVERY EVERY other game should be free updates (when ever they happen) also he can keep having his Fanboys say my review is not helpful all he wants,  still don't help his cause :D I will just put a new review up\n\nHe used putting a new Engine in as an Excuse\n\nThe Unity 5 excuse is just that, an excuse that many game makers will use. (this  is only an example not directed to you or the game but a generaliztion) Many will  say that they are moving to a new engine and then nothing is done or moved  forwards or they will resell that new version to even the old people who played  the "pre" updated. I am glad however that you state that your company/game will  not be doing this. That in my mind is another reason to revisit your game and to  possialby change my outlook and review. I tend you be more lenient to honest and  upfront Developers :)\n\nHe said they are doing differnt builds, but adding a .1 .2 .3 or other higher  numbers after a build by adding like 1 or 2 litle things doesn't make it a good  updated game.\n\nWell for one thing, it wasn't a build from that long ago, unless your saying it  has taken months and months for you to this Boss Encounter? So only thing I  didn't play yet was this Boss thing and will need to (again like I said) re- explore the landscape, as for the new items were not really that big of a change  from what have looked at, more basic things in a common game. As for the  creatures I do like a few of them, more added engagments are always a plus. So  again from what I have played your game does not stand out in any way then all  the many many games that are out there. I do however feel that your game does  have potential but surely a long way to go.\n\nI will have no problem revisiting your game later, I will have time in about a  week to do so, I will see what has been added and if its really being impoved and  it contiunes to devlope then I may change how I feel about the game. Problem is  from what I played and from the games out there, this game does not really stand  out. It also has way to go and with out real advancement, but again I will take  the time to play it and give it another go. Also, is this trasnsiting to Unity 5  the excuse your useing for not contiuning to impove? I have seen companies who  say "but we are putting it into a new engine" then later put out another Verison  of the same game but with HD files and better and then CHARGE people who already  have the "old" version and walk away from the "old" version with the "new"  version and make bank while selling both and getting away with it. Time will  Tell.\n\n(later on) I did revisit, still think and feel the same, nothing new, same game  like the thousands of other games out there just like it.  OH WAIT...this is all  winter where most other games have differnt weathered seasons. hmmm....\nTime has told, and its still a game that feel like a retextured generic game like  many others.  wish I never got it, but live and learn right? !  :D\n\nAlso, kinda funny how the developers are all playing ARK: Survival Evolved , I  think they are to busy trying to copy as much as they can from that game then  making thier own game better.  just a thought....\n\nP.S had to make a new review because the developers and fanboys all tried doing  thumbs down on my review because they don't want people seeing and bad reviews.\n\nalso I did a bunch of Achivments so this way they can't do like they are doing to many people and say well if you try it now we can look at your achivments and see how far you got in thier bad game. I guess they want proof that you wasted your time.  oh well...","November 29, 2015","false","6.7"," 49 of 88 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","49","88","5","12"

Not even really sure how large the island is but I get lost frequently.\n- Hosting is an issue for me. I'd like to be able to host for more than just 8 people. So far thats all I've seen are 8 man server hostings.\n- Mining rocks, this is questionable on just what you may or may not find. Ores are the most sought out pieces for me. Always making new armors because they take just a few hits before they are broken. Don't know if rocks respawn their ores. Needs to be taken up witht he Devs.\n- Fun. It's a game for me.

As if it wasn't already obvious enough.\nThis is an early access game, do not expect a full polished product. The game is prone to bugs and imbalances, if these bugs or imbalances in the game irritate you so much that you don't want to play, don't buy early access games.\n\nThe survival genre has been beaten to death and the only reason I purchased this game to start was because..\n1. Dragons.\n2. Dragons.\n3. 40% off.\n\nThe main survival part of the game is coldness. You are on a snowing island and are trying to keep warm while fending off wolves, boars, skellingtons and other creatures. Most games generally just have you worry about hunger and thirst, which can get very repetitive after awhile. The third mechanic implemented into this game is enough to make you think about what you're going to do for the night. Unlike the majority of survival games, you NEED resources to survive the night. It is not optional, you will not make it through the night without food and heat.\n\nThings not only fight back in this game, but seek you out if you are near. Wolves are the most dangerous threat of the island as they are quick and can inflict bleeding. The combat is okay, but can be improved upon. The hit detection in the game needs to be polished a little bit, but it's still fairly smooth.\n\nRisk vs. Reward in exploring. In Savage Lands the monsters, weather, limited bag space, and other factors make it so other players are less likely to kill you on sight. *cough, Rust, cough* The more people on your side, the faster you can stockpile resources and the more you can explore. This game just hit early access and already managed to do what every other survival game has failed to do, give incentive to work together.\n\nThe UI, although basic, is informative and easy to use. When you first drop in, you can figure out what you need to do pretty quickly. It may take you a few tries before you get decent at surviving the first couple nights, especially with some current little bugs, WHICH I might add... The Devs have already stated would be fixed in the next patch a few days from now.\n\nOverall, it's a very good game. If you like survival games and fantasy, I would highly recommend it. Very fun to play and if development is steady, I could definitely see this being a best seller on Steam.","March 7, 2015","true","14.4"," 32 of 56 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","32","56","4","1"

No Dinosaurs but at least the Devs are active. For the moment. There are bugs (duh) but they will be eliminated.\nThere are some annoyances though. The hitboxes in combat seem fairly sluggish, Eg Skeleton being able to hit me without me being in melee range, making it really difficult to fight really anything with out lossing hp. So no strafing.

For example, when you attack animals sometimes they just run straight into the ocean.\nBut, the gameplay makes up for it. I haven't play Solo yet, only co-op, but let me tell you, the co-op is amazing. For about an hour my friend and I were scavenging and foraging for sticks to complete our house, we had a fire roaring outside the house in the eerie nighttime as the wolves howled to the white moon in the distance. He was outside looking for deers, as I was huddling in the corner of the newly completed shack, scared. Eventually, I came up with enough nerve to venture the dark forest outside the wooded shack. I started to walk up the hill, stone axe drawn. I spotted my friend on the top of the steep hill, dancing around. I started following him, and as we stumbled along the ridged top of the hill line I heard a loud bark. Startled, I stopped, and I see a dark, low figure with wide, devilish yellow eyes peering at me, studying me. Another one emerged from behind it, also a low, mangy yellow eyed creature staring into my eyes. The first one pounced at me, and I started swinging my axe aimlessly. My friend turned around, and started punching the wolves. Both of them were chomping at me, both hunting for the human flesh of my character as they sunk their teeth into my leg. The second wolf pounced at my friend, his arms flailing at the creature as it showed its red, pointy teeth at him. I swing my stone axe at the wolf, and it cleanly hits the wolf in the head with a thunk, a stream of blood runs down the devilish wolves black fur, the blood barely seen from the darkness. The wolf yelps, and its head bounces down from the blow from my stone axe, and almost hits the ground. It looks back up and shakes its head, growls, and pounces. I try to land another hit, but it doesn't land. It misses and hits next to the wolf, it counters against the attack and bites into my flesh, I scream, and pull away, my eyes bloodshot, my friend also close to death battling the other wolf, I try to flee but the wolf pounces on my back, my feet slow down, the wolf bites again, I slow to a stop and drop the stone axe, I look at the wolf, fur matted down on its head, and watch it jump at me once more before all goes black.","March 7, 2015","true","4.0"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","59","23","39","8","7"

It didn't cost much, and some improvements I'd hoped to see quickly actually came with their latest patch, "....which was nice. " /Fast Show UK\n\nWhat do I expect from Early Access purchases? That fundamentally, the game is playable (for me, it is). I'm entertained, and find it relaxing to stop thinking about stressful real life crap and just come in here and think, instead, about stressful imaginary crap. So, there's that.  I think it's off to a good start, and I think I'll keep playing, and see where things go.\n\nThis review has been amended 20-3-2015 following updates that actually gave us some of the items I listed below.\n\n******************************************************\n\nThat said:\n\nDoes it need more refinement? Yes. Could it use more depth? Yes.  Are there some illogical elements insofar as what can/cannot be crafted? Yes. In what world can I build a house with no shelves? Forge armour and not craft a ranged weapon?  (yes, I know they're coming, huzzah).\n\nIs the weather and landscape lacking a certain degree of variety/dynamism? Yes.  It looks like Skyrim now and then, in some semi-modded capacity...or more accurately, Skyrim: Groundhog Day.  It'd be great to see some climate variation, even if this is meant to be a cold island, light/clouds/tones of the sky still change from day-to-day in the real world.\n\nBuggy? Eh...I find minor things - one crash the other day, trees that are apparently made of indestructible material, and the wolfskin helms that bug out and hide your head.   On the whole it's worked fine for me in that respect.\n\nAssuming my bows and arrows show up soon, (and honestly you can kill deer without them easily enough, but it'd be a nice touch), this is my wishlist thus far:\n\n1) If I decide to plot a house, I'd like to decide to UNPLOT, (or even unBUILD) it at some point. I made the mistake of dropping a stone house plan nearby, only to see it bug out half a metre above the ground, and apparently I'm stuck with it until we have a way to undo these - bleh. Kind of a landscape killer there, guys. EDIT: 20-3-2015 - Building diagrams can now be disassembled by the player by hitting it. Nice one. Thanks for that.\n\n2)Houses need the ability/capacity to have fires, or at least hang torches, inside them. I get that wood=fire, but again, if we can craft homes of stone, we can craft FIREPLACES of stone, or at least firepits in homes that include the means by which air/heat/smoke can escape, surely. It's not necessarily about having a fire to keep warm, if the home is providing that benefit - it's about that elusive fine line between "survival" and "surviving very nicely, thank you very much".\n\n3)As others have suggested, craftable forges would be nice so that players can live where they like and still get this done without travelling to them. EDIT: 20-3-2015 - loving the blacksmithing addition; this gives you not only a craftable forge at a location of your choice, but doing that gives you another heat source, indoor light, as well as a windowed dwelling of sorts.\n\n4)I personally think the "hunger" timer is too fast - even if you're cold and running around all day, I'm pretty sure you can't eat 5 entire deer, a bucketload of tree nuts, 5 berries and two wolves without at least needing to unbuckle that armour and have a good lie-down.  Conversely, I think the cold timer is pretty spot-on, ESPECIALLY once you gear up a bit, and take the time to whack a few trees for some nuts while you go out hunting - it's very manageable indeed. EDIT: 20-3-2015 - hunger timer improved somewhat/some minor food improvements made. Huzzah.\n\n5)IMHO brewing would be cool. Humans have managed to make things-to-drink-out-of-other-things from the earliest days of civilisation.  Perhaps a mechanic where drinking anything alcoholic gives you a boost or small benefit - but at a minor cost to body heat.\n\nOn the whole, I find this is a promising title and I hope the devs STAY ON IT and flesh it out a lot more. If they do, I think it would have a solid audience looking for something that brings together building/survival and that lovely feeling of an older world.\n\nI'm sure there's more, and I'll come back to this eventually, but I've had fun in here, will continue to do so, hopefully.\n\n*****","March 18, 2015","true","46.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

But this could have been due to a bad seed.\nGraphically I would even say that this is a masterpiece. Some scenes looks like it belongs more in a oil paint than in this game, it is that good.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJx_4ZCXgzY\n\nI love the building system, unlike other survival games, Savage Lands doesn't just throw you into the world without no instructions. Your Journal comes very handy in explaining the basic mechanics of the game. The building system is simple and yet intuitive.\n\nThe only thing I had to look it up was how to find sinew. Other than that the game this game is almost perfect.\n\nIt could use a few more living things in the world. The skies are empty and would benefit from some sort of life flying around.\n\nOne frustrating thing is that if you die, you loose everything unless you can get back where you died. However the fact that you don't even start with the basic tools that you started the game with it's very disappointing. It's easier to start a new save than bothering getting everything back. Hopefully the developers will fix this soon. Yes I'm looking at you dev dude :)\n\n\nI'd recommend getting a good grasp of the game before venturing too far. A weapon is a must.\n\nHere are the Pros and Cons of this game:\n\nPros:\n\n+Gorgeous graphics\n+SImple and Effective building system\n+Great Mechanics\n+Instructions are certainly a plus\n+Multiplayer Games\n\nCons:\n-Barren world at times\n-Lots of exploration required to find what you need\n-No basic tools/loot after death.\n-Character model needs improvement.\n\nThis game is totally worth getting. I am looking forward to play it again and again. If you like survival games this is a must.","March 6, 2015","true","3.9"," 27 of 47 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","27","47","4","0"

It has a great concept behind it. To survive in this game you HAVE to make friends to get near the "endgame". The community, for the most part, is really friendly. The game play is fun as well.\nThe only MAJOR problems I've personally witnessed since purchase of this game is the Player hosted servers.\nDon't get me wrong, some are great. But others have some insane problems. Between deer walking in the sky to trees spinning through the ground up into the air. I know it's still an Early Access so i don't take it too much to heart that strange things are happening constantly.\n\nThe only other bothersome problem is the amount of decorative builds you can make. they serve no use in game but to make things look pretty. BUT if they were actually able to be used, it would be FANTATIC.\n\nThe game is quite well built and i would suggest and crafting/survival fan check it out.\n\nMy favorite part by far is the fact that when you kill small goats they scream in a way that can only be described as hillarious.\n\n7/10 for the game\n\n9/10 for screaming goats.","October 19, 2015","true","34.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","1"

This game has EXTREME potential.  Very hard to survive, not impossible but much harder, on your own and must contribute a little team work.  Lots of pros and a few cons that I am sure will be addressed in the future.\n\nPros:\nExtremely realsitic\nYou actually have to work at surviving, it isnt a given\nYou have to actually hunt and not walk out the door and pop a random animal\nVery good AI difficulty\nGathering resources is the clostest to realistic of any survival game i have layed to date.\nYour character can freely raom between servers\n\nCons:\nLimited to 8 players unless on a dedicated server\nMore deicated servers to provide larger populations on a server would be a big plus for this game for PVP\nNeed a way to lock and own your own structures, Ability to make the public or private(invite) communities\nWALLS are needed.  Every survival game needs walls.\nMore Hotbar slots!\nAbility to form clans no larger then 8 i would say with shared structures and such.\n\nOverall this is a fabulous game with loads of potential.

I've played a lot of the early access survival games and there's a few out there with much potential. SAVAGE LANDS seems great so far.\n\nOnce you get a good system of gameplay happening then you have the opportunity to begin exploring and working towards crafting better gear. People who complain about losing everything when they die need to learn to strategize so I think that kind of argument is invalid.\n\nI've read some mixed reviews on this game but for me, so far, what these guys have given us is solid enough. I hope they come through with their update promises (looking forward to a bow).\n\nWell done so far devs and if you continue through to full release this game will top the list in survival games. I purchased on sale and most likely wouldn't pay the $25 pricetag for any early access game. For early access I think devs need to carefully consider their pricing.\n\nAnyway, I look foraward to seeing the updates continue to roll in.","March 14, 2015","true","10.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

But new updates and bug-fixes are released all the time, so the devs are realy working on this game, wich is nice.\n\nThe second thing I want to say is: You WILL die! End of story, you simply will die! Not even Bear Grylls would survive this. on the first try. If the hunger doesn't get you, I bet the wolves or sceletons or those god damn bears will. And if you manage to survive all of those ordeals, the cold will kill you in the meantime. The good thing is that if you manage to find a village or maybe build a home, you can build a respawn point, so each time you die you will still have your stuff you have gathered and you home will be there.\n\nThis game is a typical survival game. You gather wood/stones/food and alot of other stuff. Then you craft things like weapons/armor/buildings and try to survive the hostile environment.\nThe crafting system is fun and rewarding, with alot of different things to craft.\n\nAnother good thing is the night/day system. During the day you can run around and hunt or gather stuff or even explore. But during the night, it's a different story. It's very cold so you need to keep inside and have something to warm you. And the night brings out some scary creatures too.\n\nAll in all I would recomend this game to people who like survival games. But remember: This is not a fully completed game, so there will be bugs/glitches/not very well-thought-out ideas that have ben implemented in the game.\nBut if you don't mind that it's a great game already, and it has alot of potential to be even better.","March 12, 2015","true","21.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

The sound is very high quality and the ambience is very well done and really provides a good atmosphere.\nThe hunger, heat, and health aspects are well-done and are a very good mechanism for the gameplay and the immersion.\nThere is a sense of progression in the game, which is good for a game such as this because you can get plenty of hours out of it, and start over if you ever get bored.\nThe character mechanic with individual inventories per character, similar to Terraria, works well with the game as you can create new worlds and new characters separately.

I like the realism of the survival situation quite a bit because it makes you think on your toes. While I know it's not a finnished game there is a LARGE list of things I would say should REALLY get added into it to make it a quality game. It is very bare bones at the moment with little technical things like option screens and whatnot, which I understand, but as far as things I hope they're going to add as far as polish, I would very much appreciate an intro (though skippable) or SOME semblance of plot, and some reactionary voice acting from the player character would also be lovely, in addition to some lil tutorial bits, tips and pointers. Next, inventory. It does make a pretty fair amount of sense as is, with logs counting as whole objects and smaller things being stackable. The only thing I would say however that REALLY small items like berries, nuts and leaves shouldn't actually take up any room. The real issue I find however is the hunger clock. In general it's just far too simple to have any semblance of realism. You're constantly ticking down in a way that doesn't have anything to do with your activity level, and at an insane speed. You can litterally starve to death before the day is even over. (What am I a shrew?) The player already has quite enough to deal with in trying to stay warm and actually develop a camp. What I think it should contribute to, which would make the game much more realistic is an energy quality. The fuller the player, the more able they are in doing all their tasks, (makes a lot of survival sense) That way, in a sense of efficiency there's still quite some urgency to get food, but it's not constantly life or death. (Cold is in fact a much more immediate concern and could probably stay as is.) Now in relation to food, we'd have to mention hunting. This game's hunting mechanic is probably the silliest I've seen... in any survival game ever. You chase deer with a sword, and hit them in the but. They only reason you can actually kill them is because they're utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  You don't have to sneak, you don't have to set baint, you don't have to aim, and the only thing around are deer and wolves. (both of which, should be in all honesty an very rare thing to just "stumble upon" every time you run backwards into the forrest) So in general it would make a lot more sense to have a more trap-reliant system, with more small game, and more nuts and berries, roots and tubers, and for larger game it should be MUCH more difficult and MUCH more rewarding. (vs, "Oh, I killed a deer by walking up to it and hitting it, guess that's only enough food for like the next two hours or so") a carcass dragging mechanic in some form or another would also be good. And sinew is guts... all animals have guts (and bones), not just deer.  I noticed there was a compass somewhere in this game, so I'm not sure how that works yet, but I think a good positioning system that wouldn't take too much away from the feeling of "lostness" would be the ability to make a pinpoint on say like a shelter and it will keep track of the relative direction of that point. Not distance or anything relative to any other object, just ONE point, (just... give em SOMEthing please) Then, last but not least. Why in the heck isn't there a sleeping mechanic in this game? Am I litterally just going to have to be awake for weeks at a time? The shelter's are almost completely useless without it. Don't I get tired? Can't someone die from lack of sleep? Also can we make like a box please at some point. I do very much like the "vicinity" mechanic, but it does get kinda messy. Overal I think the game has a lot of potential. I wouldn't say that it is ready as-is, by a long shot but I've still enjoyed it quite a bit thus far.","March 16, 2015","true","33.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Deer, wolves, and bears seem plentiful but there are also monsters that roam around (more commonly at night). Skeletons seem to be plentiful in certain areas but and most people will find that unfightable dragon within the first hour or so. The forest giant which is seen in the trailer is probably the most interesting enemy Ive encountered so far both from a gameplay and aesthetic perspective.\n\nCrafting is kept simple by not revealing recipies until after you've gotten some of the materials for it. I found this a nice way to do it because I wasnt wondering "where do I get this and that to make this" since usually I had already collected those materials. You can make all sorts of weapons, armor, bags, and buildings. You can even make your own town if youre so inclined to gather all the materials\n\nThe game also runs pretty well but to be fair I do have a GTX 760 with 16 GB of ram. Theres very little that doesnt run well on my PC. Ive heard that the game is poorly optimized for lower end PCs but I havnt had that issue myself.\n\nThe graphical fidelity of the game (detail) isnt all that great. I would compare it with textures that are somewhere in the 2007-2009 era but that said the aesthetics (art direction) is pretty spot on. The shapes of buildings, ruins, towns, enemies, and more make the game feel like your in a european island circa 19th century\n\nIn my experience the game is pretty bug free at time of writing. The only bugs Ive run into so far are graphical ones like a tree I chopped down disappeared. However to be fair I still consider myself in the "just starting" phase so well see if that changes.\n\nPerhaps the biggest praise I can give the game is to the developers themselves. They seem very active on the steam forum addressing questions and listening to feedback. I wish more developers were as involved in the community side as these developers are.\n\nSo bottom line: Is it worth buying?\n\nWell I picked it up on sale for 8,99 and thats a little more then what lunch costs me. Ive had more then an hours fun with Savage lands so yes, i think its worth a buy at the sale price. However for full price...honestly I would say wait and see how development shapes up.","August 5, 2015","true","16.5"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","1"

The only thing you do in this game is kill for food, and mine rocks. There seems to be an objective near the end to kill a dragon? This dragon can not be beat, he shoots fire so fast you just stand there and die. I am very dissapointed with the complete game play. There are so many bad things to list I will try to cover them all, There is very bad glitch in game play, the animals just run if you are the game host, walls that were added animals run right through, you get hungry way to quick, not enough food to sustain hunger, so 70 percent of time playing is hunting, crap loads of oar and only selective weapons not to mention gold and silver does almost the same damage, enemies do way to much damage versuse charactor, armor sucks, shields are are a complete waste, the life bar being mixed with health, and cold sucks, the weapons suck, animals kick boxes all over area and you constantly have to put them back in place, can't build where I want to, or need to for no reason, way to much sinew, and hide, trash bin takes to long to empty, have to build 4 to 5, 8 hours of game play with 3 people and you end up with 200 heads from your dead bodies that you can not get rid of, and many, many more. The concept of this game was killer, I would love to be able to sit and play this game without yelling at my PC.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thanaderp/recommended/307880/","Thanaderp","Thanatar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thanaderp/","731 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNOTE: My experience, I believe, sounds very different from other players. I'll summarize it below.\n\nThis is a very good game, made by great devs who communicate with their players. It runs well on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop, which is always a plus, and fits the fantasy niche for the survival genre nicely.\n\nThe game might seem unforgiving, and I've heard it is, but based upon my own experiences I can't really fully back that or add it to my complaints. The game world is dangerous, but it's most certainly forgiving, once you have a spawn point.\n\nBefore I go into detail about my experience/what I think everyone should do, I suppose some pros/cons:\nPros:\n+Excellent... atmosphere? From snowstorms to dense fog, this really affects gameplay and the experience of it all and I really like it as a feature.\n+Fantasy theme, with powerful enemies that provide a challenge. And as of recent updates, a powerful dragon that also adds to the experience, more notably the experience of running for your life from a dragon.\n+Well optimized? Well, I think it runs well on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop and that's something.\n+Consistent aesthetic really makes for a believeable/cool universe\n\nCons:\n-Lack of dedicated servers, though the devs have stated that this will change. Also, maximum size of servers is 8.\n-Building options currently lack much customizability, though in return it offers a consistent aesthetic. This also is considering the building on hills and such problems.\n\nI would have added "navigation (as in even with a compass) to the cons, but the devs say that with the next update friendly servers will have names visible across a large distance. Navigation usually adds to the experience (of a dangerous/mysterious environment) but its real drawback is in multiplayer when you lose sight of your friends quickly.\n\nThere are currently a decent amount of enemies, weapons, and armor, but not enough to add to pros or cons... but the devs are consistently adding such things, and seeing some upcoming content in their stream I'm optimistic this will eventually be a strong point of the game as well.\n\n\nAnyways, about my experience, I suppose I'd reccomend to anyone playing to IMMEDIATELY make a spawnpoint (that skull-looking thing). Use it preferably in Argos, that's what I did. Believe it or not I'd reccomend starting in singleplayer.\nFor the first few days/nights, you can make a fire and apart from that spend your days searching for wood and mining, and hunting deer/etc. At night, more enemies will spawn, and you want to kill them. Even if you have to use your stone axe, kill them. You might die once or twice to a Fury but once you kill them (and reclaim your stuff) you'll have a sword, which will deal a decent amount of damage, and you might have some armor.\n\nSimilarly, fight plague wolves. I can't stress this enough. Anyways, whatever Human Bones, Plague Wolf furs, Rotting flesh, and sinew/leather hides you can get, keep it. The flesh-wrapped bag is something I don't know how I lived without before I had it anymore. It's easily craftable early on, and it's the best bag for maximizing storage space.\n\nJust in general fight anything you can. There's no farming in this game, so you can expect to be dependent on hunting, though it's not a problem. Wolves will chase you down if they see you, and are not too uncommon around Argos; you should kill as many as you see and quickly forge yourself a set of wolfskin armor. As for deer, the second that you've either made or acquired a sword/club, stop using a bow to hunt them. Bows are complete crap for hunting, they only are any good for dealing with powerful enemies from afar in groups or drawing aggro from specific enemies. Instead, sneak up on deer and slash them twice quickly; if there are two, you can sneak up on the first and hit it twice, and continue sneaking on to the second... it's easy! And if there's one, feel free to start running when you're close enough, and you'll take it down before it can get away. With that in mind you can easily collect a lot of sinew and meat.\n\nIf you find yourself running low on ores/stone, make a new world and collect around the beach before returning to your old one. It's as simple as that.\n\nOnce you have an ebon sword and full leather armor (and preferably a compass) head further north to kill off packs of wolves and even single bears... you'll find that meat and maintaining your armor suddenly isn't a challenge.\n\nTL,DR; to start off, disregard any bag but the flesh-wrapped bag. Make a firepit at Argos and instead of hiding around at night make a spawnpoint, and fight all enemies you see (near Argos). Don't use a bow for hunting. If you can rush wolf armor/stone sword/flesh wrapped bag(s), you're good to go.","June 19, 2015","true","23.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","1"

With review, please realize, if you read this, this game has promise. I'll begin with what I like.\n\n+ The small, plausible way to manage you item equipment. Yes the slots are small, however there are bags that can be crafted that will make life better.\n\n+ Rocks, as weapons... you can throws to hunt and kill deer that have ran away from you.\n\n+Relatively light game. I was able to run this game fairly smoothly.\n\n+Nice selection of swords, and "metal" weapons. I'd like to see more or a way to design your own.\n\n\nCons\n-Weapons selections, there's a lack of two handed weapons. Arrows only come in puny flint form, no cool more powerful bodkin, broadhead... or mythical/magical arrows.\n\n-Yes you can build houses but there's a lack of "block building" where you can spend however you like to build a secure and safe house, and also make it look how you want.\n\n- The world isn't procedural. You spawn, on the same island, with the same weather. Meaning you go for the same shebang, worry about the same stuff everytime you start over.\n\n-The island map isn't particularly distinctive. You are somewhat forced to build on the beach, there are no roads or real marks that are distintive and can be seen for a long while to keep you being lost and dying in the middle of the night.\n\n-Map is really small. I've played Rust, and even played Arma... these games have large maps. This map is puny compared to those. So small that you don't see much, but large enough to be annoying when you get lost (and die from hypothermia)\n\nOver all would I recomend this game... for about $10-12 bucks... yes I would.

With review, please realize, if you read this, this game has promise. I'll begin with what I like.\n\n+ The small, plausible way to manage you item equipment. Yes the slots are small, however there are bags that can be crafted that will make life better.\n\n+ Rocks, as weapons... you can throws to hunt and kill deer that have ran away from you.\n\n+Relatively light game. I was able to run this game fairly smoothly.\n\n+Nice selection of swords, and "metal" weapons. I'd like to see more or a way to design your own.\n\n\nCons\n-Weapons selections, there's a lack of two handed weapons. Arrows only come in puny flint form, no cool more powerful bodkin, broadhead... or mythical/magical arrows.\n\n-Yes you can build houses but there's a lack of "block building" where you can spend however you like to build a secure and safe house, and also make it look how you want.\n\n- The world isn't procedural. You spawn, on the same island, with the same weather. Meaning you go for the same shebang, worry about the same stuff everytime you start over.\n\n-The island map isn't particularly distinctive. You are somewhat forced to build on the beach, there are no roads or real marks that are distintive and can be seen for a long while to keep you being lost and dying in the middle of the night.\n\n-Map is really small. I've played Rust, and even played Arma... these games have large maps. This map is puny compared to those. So small that you don't see much, but large enough to be annoying when you get lost (and die from hypothermia)\n\nOver all would I recomend this game... for about $10-12 bucks... yes I would. Maybe later as this game updates and add in stuff I may reconsider... otherwise I'd save this game for when it goes on sell.","July 1, 2015","true","20.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

One hour into it you're getting a house, several tools and some other goodies. "Can't sleep, wolves will eat me." those punks come from out the woodwork to get you. Keep your sound up and pay attention to the noises around you. Otherwise, it is worth every penny. Graphics are nice but I can see the potential if it keeps getting better and better. Gender selection and a few other *glossy* touches will be nice later but for now and the fact I put more than 5 hours in from the time I downloaded it and I'm barely off the beach and just now exploring the wild. It has captivated me in a way that a fantasy survival game should. Bravo Developer for an awesome Early Access Game, I look forward to future patches.

I am an old school rpg player mainly rooted in asherons call but this games seems to some how bring back some of that classic rpg fighting warrior feel yet stay modern and exciting. You don't get your hand held and the world is unforgiving.\n\nI heard the devs say they read every review so if you read this thank you very much and three suggestions that  I would like to see in the game are more points of inrest on the map I love to explore and find new things, caves/dungeons/altars/ruins/towns/mines/etc... also as far as dungeons maybe triggers and puzzles to solve. Last but not least this is a personal request I think would be nice, I watched the Q&A's and heard about pvp and how I understood is there will be pvp and non-pvp servers I like this but may I suggest, On non-pvp servers make an altar/item/potion/quest that will turn you pvp with some visual indicator that you are pvp and allow you to only kill other players also flagged this way. You could remove the pvp flag on death or require another item to remove it. Again thank you very much if you read this review, I very rarely write reviews but this game deserves ones.","March 13, 2015","true","50.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

That part, if you're wondering if it worth, well, by the price, it's fair enough. You help the Devs, and if enjoy hard survival game with players brain needed, it's your game.

I have not seen some things yet (like bears), but I am impressed with the game.\nKeep in mind it is early access, so it has things it needs to work on.\nBuildings- the only one worth actually building is the forge. It is the only house that acutely has a permanent light and heat source, and it is relatively easy to make if you can mine up some ore and rock. It needed to make armor, better gear, and repair some stuff. The town hall I not worth it, although it is the only other one that seems to have a floor- it looks like it should be multi story but its jest a box like the rest and takes up a lot of wood. Despite what the description on it says, the forge offers more heat (or at least seems to. Spent most of my time there). There are torches, but something smaller like candles would be nice, that last longer but provide no heat. The only current furniture you can put in a house is a box, which is useful but I hope they expand to include chairs, beds, tables, etc. Or even fur rugs that bring up the warmth of the room. Fences would be nice also.\n\nTerrain- it’s a lot like getting lost in a forest. There’s rocks, trees, and sometimes abandoned buildings or towns. Also a lot of things want to kill you. There is also a tower (towers?) that has a dragon at the top. One of the things missing from the landscape however seems to be water in the form of pods, stream, or rivers. There are also no cliffs or caves, its jest hills. Due to the fact that you cant dig your own mines or whatnot, it would be nice to see mines you can use at some point.\nMining/logging- One of the things that I do dislike is the fact that ever tree and rock is a finite resource. There is no way to grow back trees and rocks get mines out after a bit. Without the ability to create a mineshaft or other resource gathering things, this means you will always have to venture further and further out. Not that big a deal, until you get to the higher tires of crafting and more so with high tire repairs. I don’t know if items held on a character travel with them to other maps, but there is a point where you could clear the map of all trees/rocks. There are mini spawning points near rocks for some of the things you can get form them, but for large scale crafting it won’t sustain you. That said, it’s kind of fun to look for things and be able to make where you have been before with if a rock is taped out or not.\n\nEnemies are hard. The only thing that doesn’t attack you is deer. The damage system could use work, but it’s like mine craft alpha where there was no knockback. A damage indicator as in what direction things are hitting you from would be nice. Low health gives you the blood eyes thing and makes the screen grayer. So far, I haven’t had much trouble with anything other than one enemy. I found a tree giant at some point, but not knowing what they looked like (and because they don’t move) I thought it was a resource… that went well. I lived but he broke all my armor (it would be nice to be able to repair broken gear by the way!) and he went back into the trees.\nAll in all, it’s fun. I think it would be better with people, as I have been playing until this point solo.\n\n10/10 got wrecked by a tree","September 17, 2015","true","11.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","3"

Knowing not how I came to be here, I began to wander and eventually found the destroyed town of Argo. With a fire and a forge, I made my home - yet the ominous roar of Kur hanging just over my shoulder kept me awake the first few weeks of my unintended stay.\nI learned how to mine, cut wood, and even forge my own gear - even brought a friend along with me. We crafted ourselves some chainmail and felt fairly confident about abilities. He, being the arrogant one, said Kur was harmless - and repeatedly called him Hector. We were then chased by Kur for about 20 mins as he breathed fire in our paths. Luckily, he grew bored and left.\nAs the sun began to go down, in the distance I spotted a glowing sphere - two of them actually. I quickly approached hoping that it would be treasures of some kind. Nope, they were spirit wolves - and there were about 7.

I have to say that for all I heard about a lack of content uh in my almost 4 hours of playing I had more than enough to do and it was a tense experience.  It felt how a survival game should feel and it also felt like I was in a Skyrim-like world.  Now I got this game during the Steam Winter Sale so I did not pay the current full price but I could easily pay for $20 for this and feel comfortable about it.  I definitely can recommend this to others but realize people it is an early access game and so things can change and the game might not even work from time to time.","January 9","true","3.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It is simply too hard for 96.7% of average game players. I have made it to day 89 of 7DTD solo without dying. I have played other games hardcore, as well. But this game was almost unplayable. The learning curve is wicked hard. Almost none of the people posting game videos online have made it past 4 videos. They simply cannot remain alive.\n\nPROS: Great looking game visually even on lower video settings.\nCONS: The repeated use of the same trees that can be harvested gives it a christmas tree farm look at times.\nPROS: Great weapons and armor\nCONS: You can have an Ebon Steel axe or Ebon Steel Armor. You only have enough gem shards for one or the other due to fairly horrid constant repair costs.\nPROS: The game has a relentless feel that drives you to goals related to survival, such as warmth and food.\nCONS: The game is developed by devs who are like frustrated teenagers who inexplicably took viagra. The warmth and life bars lose 1 life per second at times. The devs are like the boyfriend who is premature, and the players are the girlfriends who have a moue.\nPROS: The crafting although basic is doable and has a need to do it to survive element to it.\nCONS: There are only a few abandoned buildings to stay in, requiring you to make camp fires every couple of minutes as you travel at the beginning. Also there is only one forge in an abandoned town I found to use at the beginning, and it is camped by a patrolling red eyed skeletal warrior. They are instant death at the beginning, but by the time you have chainmail and an Ebon Steel Axe, they are simply annoying, as they cause damage to your armor that is horrid to fix.\n\nCONCLUSION: Love the game, love playing it. But it is going to fail in commercial release, as it is simply too hard. Even if they put in a do this, then do that tutorial, the game is simply too hard for the majority of gamers. I had to delete my first 8 games, since bears and wolf packs camped my bodies making them unretrievable. Great game. Too hard. Loses all but the very most stubborn veteran sandbox players.

What I wasn't expecting, however, was for the developers to actually respond to my review and ask for specific feedback. And you know what? I just gained a significant amount of respect for them. Too many people these days just totally ignore people's feedback, and it's very refreshing to see someone who cares about what their players have to say.\n\nTo be honest, the problem isn't really with the game. I had to turn the settings way down to get the game to run right, I got lost in the wilderness within minutes, and I just couldn't really find anything to do. Really, the truth is I just have no business buying early access games and expecting them to be as polished and content-filled as a full game; I honestly don't know what I was thinking.\n\nDear developers, if you are reading this: I apologize for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review.

I've played this game on and off for nearly a year (played time is inaccurate, it's actually 15-25 hours) and it's gone nowhere. Performance is still poor, the game is still extremely limited in scope, and surviving against supernatural hordes in a "heavy metal arctic wilderness" is not nearly as fun as it sounds. The game still doesn't support Surround/Eyefinity, but performance is so poor even on one screen that this is somewhat irrelevant. Every time there is a new patch we keep going back to give it another chance and every time we keep ending up disappointed to find that nothing much has changed. Crafting isn't fun, building isn't fun, and surviving definitely isn't fun.\n\nEven The Forest is far ahead of this game, and The Long Dark (flaws, limitations and all) is even further ahead. 7 Days to Die is basically 50 times better than this game, and because 7DTD exists there is no reason for Savage Lands to.\n\nDeleted, probably for good.

Throughout playing Savage Lands, there was many factors of the game that seemed to be replicated from games like The Forest, and throughout the both the similarities became dissapointing. It did not completely throw away my experience of Savage Lands but it is just a warning to the people who don't like games like The Forest, because this is like The Forest.\n\nI am going to leave the pros and cons down below,  and I will then conclude my final opinion.\n\nPros:\n-------------------------------------\n\n- Advanced AI and unique creature animations make NPC's scary and immersively realistic.\n\n- Inventory system along with crafting is bugless, and very easy to use.\n\n- Graphics are decent enough to immerse me into the gameplay.\n\n- The game takes realistic survival factors and implements them into the game, including a body temperature system which drops exponentially at the night. This makes the game challenging in a good way.\n\n- Dragons...pretty damn cool\n\n- Various creatures, all of which have their own unique properties, made the game much funner to explore.\n\n- Ruins and towns, gave the game a mysterious feel, making exploration enjoyable.\n\nCons:\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n- Badly Optimised, lagg spikes often on Good enough computer.\n\n- Combat system is clunky and skill-less, causes combat to be quite unenjoyable and I found myself avoiding some creatures because there is no proper way to block in the game, and I would die inevitably. Also the NPC's tend to hit you even if there animation is not directly hitting you on screen. Quite dumb.\n\n- Parts of the game such as cutting down trees and crafting seems like a clone of The Forest and it slightly throws away the uniqueness of the game.\n\n- Your character cannot jump up on rocks at most times, moveability is uncomfortable, and even when shift sprinting, animals can catch you and kill you.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\n-------------------------------------\n\nThe game succeeds to appetise my survival addiction through it's mysterious and mystical gameplay environment and harsh survival factors.

Before going to far into yes, the game is Early Access, and yes, there are some bugs, (deer twitching around in areas with a high tree density, two packs of wolves travelling on top of each other for a total of 8 etc) but none of them are game breaking IMO.\n\nToo many survival sandbox games have popped up promising a lot and offering so little. If you are like me at all and want a sandbox game in which you dont have to worry about mobs of ♥♥♥♥♥ killing you at spawn (DayZ, Nether, Ark, Rust, and any other game in which you spawn on a beach) or those same mobs of ♥♥♥♥♥ breaking into your house when youre gone due to real life responsibilities and robbing you of 10s of hours then this is a game for you.\n\nThe community is great as far as i can tell, in the time that i have played i have had no issues with griefers or trolls.\nThe game in itself is amazing, a huge map to explore, diverse amount and types of enemies to kill and be killed by.\nBuilding system similiar to the forest, which works just fine IMO\nCrafting system is pretty fantastic as well, well a good amount of armour and weapons to craft, lots of storage options.\nAnd the game is updated on a fairly regular basis.\nAlso easy to connect to and play with friends\nI really hope the game continues at its current pace, as this game has, on its own, restored my faith in the Steam EA program\n\n10/10 Would get lost, freeze, bleed, and burn to death again","July 5, 2015","true","50.7"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","11","18","3","6"

Also had quite a few problems with crashes and freezes... check it out when it actually releases, i feel like it will be a more complete game and wont be such a hassle to play due to freezes/crashes.","August 4, 2015","false","0.6"," 43 of 80 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","43","80","0","5"

It's been so long in early access and yet it's so empty and dull.\nLet's talk about it, shall we.\n\ntl;dr - The game is dull, boring and there is nothing to do. Don't bother buying it.\n\nThere was a survival Check-List, to guide you a bit around.\nSure, not bad. Only thing, it was really just the basic stuff. Chop tree, hunt deer, gather stone, gather log, gather flint, etc.\nNothing... amazing.\n\nCombat didn't seem to interesting, like in many such games, but with less. No blocking. Using the bow felt bad... Meh.\n\nThe island itself is dead. I ran around for few minutes to find nothing but emptiness. I needed to hunt animals, to get leather and other stuff, to craft me some better stuff. Took a while to find anything. But then.... Hunting a deer was just terrible. You hit it, it runs away, a bit further away it stops, you go to it and hit it, it runs away, etc. Repeat that for a while and it's dead. Yay.... Now for the next deer.... I haven't even encountered many wolves or anything. There are wild boars, which I haven't even seen. There is a dragon by the tower and flies around, but.... I saw no reason to hunt it. At night... there are Plague wolves, which are wolves, but "scarier" and a lot stronger. How fun. I just haven't really seen any wild-life most of the time. Which is kinda disappointing. Especially since you NEED TO HUNT THEM.\n\nYou could build houses... Which was a huge disappoint them... All buildings are pre-made, so it's a copy+paste building. No custom buildings for you. You gotta use what get. Which are ugly, dull and... Once built, it has no floor! It might even float above the ground a bit! Houses are supposed to protect you from the cold... Just build a camp fire and you are good. Much cheaper to make too. There aren't many buildings to begin with, nor are there really many decoration items. But hey, atleast you can have that wooden cage you always wanted!.... It's just decoration btw.\n\nIt's a survival game, so that means you need food to survival. But wait! There is more! You can freeze to death! Oh oh! How interesting! In your inventory you can see how much Health you have, how hungry you are and how cold you are. However... Cold and Hunger shown wrong. "Cold 100%" meant you aren't cold at all in-game. Normally... that means you are 100% frozen, atleast for me it would be. I don't know. Maybe it's just me, but it surely didn't seem right.\n\nMovement is all good and fine. Just wish I would actually maybe have a bar for my stamina. Oh and... you can't crouch.\n\n\nI don't know, this game is just crap and isn't anything special.\nNo reason to build anything. Hunting animals was annoying. Nothing special about this game, really.\nOh well. Can only hope this game will get better in the future. But for now, it's total crap.

It is extremely immersive and exciting to get into. Struggling to survive in a world with nothing but cold and death. I loved the addition of skeletons, they really make the world far more frightening and drive home the idea of being alone on a dead island. If there is one thing I dont like about the game, it is the starvation rate. Since a few other people have mentioned it, I wont get into that. But I strongly believe that there should be an addition of small game such as rabbits or weasels, I believe that there should be an addition of fish and netting, and the nuts and berries that spawn at camps should also be found on bushes and trees in the wild occasionaly. I also believe that you should be able to re-start fire pits after they have been built without having to go find more rocks to line it with. But, these things do make the game more challenging and a lot of fun. Maybe it could be that there is more food, but it goes bad as you carry and store it?\n\nDefinately buy it, try it, and support its development!

If I had to give one reason this game worked for me over all the other survival games on Steam, it would have to be the setting.  This isn't some modern zombie apocalypse or post-WW3 situation but high fantasy.  Swords!  Skeletons!  A dragon!  Plate mail!  That's my thing and I like the way this game implements elements of high fantasy in to a survival game.\n\nIt's not all peaches and cream though.  The game runs fairly poorly on my PC.  Granted, it is a fairly old PC but it still runs a lot of new games decently.  With Savage Lands, I've had to turn most of the settings down and there are still FPS spikes.  In terms of gameplay, the worst part is, without a doubt, inventory management.  You start off with a small inventory and it isn't until you start being able to craft bags that things get better.  Moving things between chests and your inventory is also a huge pain.  The cause of both of these is that items stacks are criminally small.  Inventory management would be less of a hassle with larger item stacks.\n\nThe game is in Early Access so there's not much end game or story content and there still a number of bugs and performance issues but all-in-all, I like it.  I'm eagerly awaiting the next update and that's not something I say very often about Early Access games.  If high fantasy and survival games are something you like, I'd recommend this to you.","June 2, 2015","true","31.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

You maintain your own set of characters and can import them in and out of persistant worlds. This is very handy. You can play solo, or go on-line to play with other people when you want to.\n\nMy only gripe is the mining system needs some love, along with improved combat.

At this time it's still alpha developement as f***, but if you got some good friends to play it with, you can actually have fun in this game.\n\nThe game is like a b*stard child of Skyrim and Minecraft. Now it doesn't have the graphics of Skyrim...or the graphics of Mincecraft, but it's got grit, and guts...Wolf guts mostly. An unflagging amount wolf guts. If you love wolves, do not buy this because you will have to kill a lot of these little canine a**holes to survive. JEeeeeEEEeeesus, Ricky, there are so many damn wolves--I've seen packs spawn right in front of me - SERIOUSLY?! I know this is early access, but daym. The creature/enemy spawn alone in this game is like hitting zoobats in caves.\n\nAlso this game needs a trash/destruction/dropped item decay rate thing badly because my friends and I are up to our heads in wolf pelts, bones, skeleton parts, and other random bits of useless sh*t. And it's makes the game bug the hell out.

As others have pointed out, them wolves are hungry and they aren't bothered whether you're naked or wearing clothes made out of their cousin.  My first game was ten days, I didn't freeze,  starve or drown > I was all powerful. Then I went out at night hunting deer, got ambushed by a pack of wolves, couldn't see where I was, or what I was wildly swinging my sword at.  Then I was a late night snack.\nThis game, for EA, is truly excellent. There are very few bugs (that I've discovered) and certainly none that spoil the atmosphere. Some of the graphics are a little wonky at times but I wholeheartedly recommend this and cannot wait to see where it ends up.\nI'd like an in-game clock/day counter (maybe a craftable sun dial?). I'd like the rocks to disintegrate after you've emptied them of ore. I'd like some of the item stacking to be a little higher as it's very easy to fill multiple 30-item pine boxes within a few in-game days. And I think the deterioration of equipment is a little too unforgiving.\nTweaks, minor amends, tiddly stuff.

Sure its early access but there's a lot of things to do. There is no "quest marker" or anything of the sort. Its like playing skyrim without the HUD, which i liked. There's also no map whatsoever, but I like it that way. Why? Survival of course! and this is supposed to be some kind of medieval thing going on, why would they put on a map? The compass works great too. Only idiots will not know how to use it. No compass? Use the sun! it always rises in the north and sets in the south! It is also very fun to just get lost and explore the island. There is also no info on how you do things, so most people that just bought the game always ask that question. I also like that though, because you just got shipwrecked, so how the hell can you know what to do right off the bat? Also for those complaining that there is not a lot to craft, the recipes only unlock after you gathered the ingredients needed to make it. You'll be surprised how much stuff you can craft after you have quite the amount of materials. This is why you need at least more than a few hours of game time in order to see the true beauty of the game. NEVER TRUST THE PLAYERS WHO HAVE ONLY A FEW HOURS IN! They're noobs and should'nt go near any survival games at all! Currently there are only a few things to see. I am not going to spoil what they are, though i am pretty sure most of the kids already searched or watch youtube videos anyways. I mean why play a survival game and expect it to be easy? If you play this game to "beat" it, then go somewhere else. The beauty of this game, for me, is the survival aspect and just the sheer randomness of being able to build anywhere, There are some bugs and glitches though, so i hope they will fix that. The most annoying one for me is the chat bug. If you play for a long time, the chat just dies on you and the only way to fix is is to relog. Also limited to 8 players per room, but there are people who host a server and go AFK, basically being some kind of a "dedicated server" themselves. Anyways i recommend this game to mature players who like survival games. Kids stay away please. If you want an easy game go play rust or h1z1 since they have guns and play your "COD open world" there.","June 1, 2015","true","74.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

That being said, it's very unique and play's like 50% of a survival game and 50% of a adventure / action rpg. It's combat is pretty standard and generic so far, but it doesn't detract to heavily from the game, Most of the game your stock piling supplies, but unlike other survival games, you get noticeably stronger the more you forge and find and build. The relativily huge amount of items is fun and the ability to build prebuilt structures turns out to pretty fun, as it allows for less fort building, and more adventuring and explorering. Unlike other survival games, Savage Lands expects more out of you. Your not just suppose to survive, your suppose to thrive and become dominate as a wonderer\n\nI am very impressed buy the devolper. He's been updating quite frenquently, is quite transparent and seems very in touch, if not close to the community. He not only pays attention to the bug reports, the bugs are actually fixed within the next update. I've bought a lot of crap on steam. This is the reason i buy crap, because every so often you find a diamond in the rough. This diamond may still be a bit rough but it's getting polished quick and looking very promising.\n\nbuy with confidence","June 22, 2015","true","5.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

When you realize the yellow bar is at Zero . If you were smart you would have picked up some supplies . Either crafted a stone axe , or found one . The bushes start rattling . " Oh no !"

You have savage wolf armor for hunting or ebon steel armor for pvp . PS : I love to pvp . So you go to the Northern East tower to kill bears to get their pelts , wich makes ebon steel armor .

Once you craft a decent weapon and can take deer down in one hit, you'll never run out of food or supplies.  Most of the enemies pose little threat to you after you've armored up.  I even aggro'd the dragon and several passes of his flame only damaged my armor (and refilled my heat meter, which made me lol in a good way).  The only enemy that has been able to deal me direct damage are the bears, but you can still dodge most of their attacks, so unless you aggro more than one at a time it still isn't much of a threat.  Hopefully the enemy encounters become a lot more dangerous as development continues.\n\nThat probably sounds like a negative review, but it isn't.  There's a lot to love about this game already.  The atmosphere is really great, especially at night.  I jumped in my seat when a plague wolf popped out of the brush next to me when I was exploring at night.  My absolute favorite thing so far: I got completely turned around and was lost in the game for over an hour yesterday, even with over 15 hours already behind me.  There's no map, and hopefully there never will be because trying to navigate only by landmarks and rudimentary compass in the dark during a blizzard while you try to avoid the pack of wolves you can hear but not see is one of the most suprisingly fun things I've done in a game in a long time.  If that last sentence sounds like your kind of game, go ahead and buy it.  If it doesn't, you should probably pass for now.\n\nThere's a long way to go until this is a complete game, but I've already gotten my money's worth out of it.  The devs are very active and host streams weekly and take a lot of feedback from the players, so I'm confident it will continue to improve on an already enjoyable experience.","June 24, 2015","true","57.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Like this game.\n\nI don't understand why people are complaining about the harshness of the survival aspect of the game. It's like they want a video game like farmville or Animal Crossing or something where they have to grow plants and raise moo cows and chickens or something. I understand it's frustrating when you die but that's hardly a reason to leave a negative review just because you SUCK at video games.\n\nWhen you're naked and in the cold you'll freeze to death. If you don't eat you'll starve to death. If you go too far into the forest and get attacked by a wolfpack they are going to pick the flesh right off of your bones if you haven't crafted armor and a nice sword by then.\n\nIt's all there. Find materials in the wilderness and don't go too far inland or else the undead will shove a sword through your torso. Until you gather ore from mining and craft some weapons and maybe build a blacksmith so that you have a forge to craft much needed armor. Of course you need a campfire for warmth. Hunt deer, boar and a wolf or two for meat and cook it. Then eat it. Survival 101\n\nOk, so the reason why I like this game so much is the atmosphere is amazing. Especially when you open up a server and allow a couple of people to play with you. I started one night and a group of us decided to venture off to the North East (or whatever direction it was as the sun is kind of screwed up in this game. Meaning it doesn't rise in the east and set in the west.) Craft a compass when you get access to a forge as they really help. We spent hours roaming the coast and through the woods. We came across a neat landmark. A giant dragon statue on the beach just in the water. It was super cool but unfortunately at this point in early access I don't think it does anything or has any meaning besides maybe the lore. Anyway we built a campfire after getting that far as we were starting to freeze and we waited until we were warmed up. Cooked some wolf meat from the wolves we had to kill on our way here and ate it. Then we decided to continue our track through the woods. I knew the player I was playing with was trying to find a village but I wasn't even sure what he was looking for but I kind of knew he was lost roaming the forest but it was a BLAST. Next thing I knew I looked out the window and the sun was coming up and I realized I had been playing this game roaming the coast and forest for over 6 HOURS STRAIGHT. Oh, man. So much fun.\n\nVERDICT:\n\nExploring is a blast as well as the realistic-ish survival aspects. I think they're going to put icons where all the players are so you don't have to worry about losing each other so much but I think this is a bad idea personally because I'm all about the realism, and immersion when getting lost in the wilderness. The game needs more content. It needs ruins to explore. Dungeons to find. Treasure to find. Giant monsters to find and kill for rare materials. Where are the underground caverns? The hidden castle deep in the woods? Where's the story? There is NO story. And there are no intense enemies that can still kill you with one or two blows if you venture too far where you're not supposed to after you craft some decent gear. And the reason I'm bringing all of this up because this game has sooo much potential. We need more armor to craft. Higher levels to attain. Stronger weapons to forge or find to kill even stronger enemies in the world.\n\nI trust that it will come in due time. I hope. The game is fun as it is but when I play something like this I always hope for more. That is why they call them early access I would assume.","June 24, 2015","true","36.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Thats only if you don't baracade yourself in with weapon racks and shoot arrows. Mobs should beable to destroy your stuff. especially props. Walls will be a nice addition but even walls should be breakable for mobs. just make it take a while. I will be playing this game again down the road when more updates come out. I have put quite a few hours into the game. Waiting for more crafting, mobs, buildings or constructions. Even more props.

This one has a long way to go however the content that is available is very nice. I think difficulty is just right when you first start. However late game when you have best gear, things need to be a bit more difficult. The Tree Giants are really the only things that have heavy enough damage that makes a battle hard. Thats only if you don't baracade yourself in with weapon racks and shoot arrows. Mobs should beable to destroy your stuff. especially props. Walls will be a nice addition but even walls should be breakable for mobs. just make it take a while. I will be playing this game again down the road when more updates come out. I have put quite a few hours into the game. Waiting for more crafting, mobs, buildings or constructions. Even more props.

It's sort of a mix of The Forest and Skyrim. You have to manage the cold, hunt and gather, craft weapons and armor, and just survive. Cut trees, mine, and build structures. The map is a lot larger than it seems. My only knock is that past 10 hours I feel like there isn't enough to do yet. I'm sure once it's fully fleshed out, there will be a lot more. There are also regular updates with countdowns until the next one. Nice job so far.","January 15","true","16.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Like this game.\n\nI don't understand why people are complaining about the harshness of the survival aspect of the game. It's like they want a video game like farmville or Animal Crossing or something where they have to grow plants and raise moo cows and chickens or something. I understand it's frustrating when you die but that's hardly a reason to leave a negative review just because you SUCK at video games.\n\nWhen you're naked and in the cold you'll freeze to death. If you don't eat you'll starve to death. If you go too far into the forest and get attacked by a wolfpack they are going to pick the flesh right off of your bones if you haven't crafted armor and a nice sword by then.\n\nIt's all there. Find materials in the wilderness and don't go too far inland or else the undead will shove a sword through your torso. Until you gather ore from mining and craft some weapons and maybe build a blacksmith so that you have a forge to craft much needed armor. Of course you need a campfire for warmth. Hunt deer, boar and a wolf or two for meat and cook it. Then eat it. Survival 101\n\nOk, so the reason why I like this game so much is the atmosphere is amazing. Especially when you open up a server and allow a couple of people to play with you. I started one night and a group of us decided to venture off to the North East (or whatever direction it was as the sun is kind of screwed up in this game. Meaning it doesn't rise in the east and set in the west.) Craft a compass when you get access to a forge as they really help. We spent hours roaming the coast and through the woods. We came across a neat landmark. A giant dragon statue on the beach just in the water. It was super cool but unfortunately at this point in early access I don't think it does anything or has any meaning besides maybe the lore. Anyway we built a campfire after getting that far as we were starting to freeze and we waited until we were warmed up. Cooked some wolf meat from the wolves we had to kill on our way here and ate it. Then we decided to continue our track through the woods. I knew the player I was playing with was trying to find a village but I wasn't even sure what he was looking for but I kind of knew he was lost roaming the forest but it was a BLAST. Next thing I knew I looked out the window and the sun was coming up and I realized I had been playing this game roaming the coast and forest for over 6 HOURS STRAIGHT. Oh, man. So much fun.\n\nVERDICT:\n\nExploring is a blast as well as the realistic-ish survival aspects. I think they're going to put icons where all the players are so you don't have to worry about losing each other so much but I think this is a bad idea personally because I'm all about the realism, and immersion when getting lost in the wilderness. The game needs more content. It needs ruins to explore. Dungeons to find. Treasure to find. Giant monsters to find and kill for rare materials. Where are the underground caverns? The hidden castle deep in the woods? Where's the story? There is NO story. And there are no intense enemies that can still kill you with one or two blows if you venture too far where you're not supposed to after you craft some decent gear. And the reason I'm bringing all of this up because this game has sooo much potential. We need more armor to craft. Higher levels to attain. Stronger weapons to forge or find to kill even stronger enemies in the world.\n\nI trust that it will come in due time. I hope. The game is fun as it is but when I play something like this I always hope for more. That is why they call them early access I would assume.","June 24, 2015","true","36.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Once you craft a decent weapon and can take deer down in one hit, you'll never run out of food or supplies.  Most of the enemies pose little threat to you after you've armored up.  I even aggro'd the dragon and several passes of his flame only damaged my armor (and refilled my heat meter, which made me lol in a good way).  The only enemy that has been able to deal me direct damage are the bears, but you can still dodge most of their attacks, so unless you aggro more than one at a time it still isn't much of a threat.  Hopefully the enemy encounters become a lot more dangerous as development continues.\n\nThat probably sounds like a negative review, but it isn't.  There's a lot to love about this game already.  The atmosphere is really great, especially at night.  I jumped in my seat when a plague wolf popped out of the brush next to me when I was exploring at night.  My absolute favorite thing so far: I got completely turned around and was lost in the game for over an hour yesterday, even with over 15 hours already behind me.  There's no map, and hopefully there never will be because trying to navigate only by landmarks and rudimentary compass in the dark during a blizzard while you try to avoid the pack of wolves you can hear but not see is one of the most suprisingly fun things I've done in a game in a long time.  If that last sentence sounds like your kind of game, go ahead and buy it.  If it doesn't, you should probably pass for now.\n\nThere's a long way to go until this is a complete game, but I've already gotten my money's worth out of it.  The devs are very active and host streams weekly and take a lot of feedback from the players, so I'm confident it will continue to improve on an already enjoyable experience.","June 24, 2015","true","57.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

That being said, it's very unique and play's like 50% of a survival game and 50% of a adventure / action rpg. It's combat is pretty standard and generic so far, but it doesn't detract to heavily from the game, Most of the game your stock piling supplies, but unlike other survival games, you get noticeably stronger the more you forge and find and build. The relativily huge amount of items is fun and the ability to build prebuilt structures turns out to pretty fun, as it allows for less fort building, and more adventuring and explorering. Unlike other survival games, Savage Lands expects more out of you. Your not just suppose to survive, your suppose to thrive and become dominate as a wonderer\n\nI am very impressed buy the devolper. He's been updating quite frenquently, is quite transparent and seems very in touch, if not close to the community. He not only pays attention to the bug reports, the bugs are actually fixed within the next update. I've bought a lot of crap on steam.

Can't wait to see what the game will be like once it's fully done. There are already many things to explore, but would love to see something like dungeons, caves, abandoned fortresses/castles etc.\n\nThe game reminds me really much of Skyrim, which is a good thing. And speaking of which I think the combat system of Skyrim would fit perfectly into Savage Lands. Being able to wield swords in both hands or a shield in the left and sword in the right or magic in the left and weapon in the right one etc. Possibilities would be endless. Also, would like to see more things to build. Building a whole village is pretty dull at the moment since there are only different sized houses + blacksmith. Something like mills, docks, library for enchanting etc.\n\nOverall, Savage lands is a solid survival game particularly for my taste as it is not stuffed with overly complicated features and too CPU-destroying graphics. Clearly the main focus has been the gameplay and not the visuals, which is the way it should be in my opinion. Love the game already and it is not even finished. Especially fun to play with friends.

At the current time more of a solo/exploring game than a crafting or building one,  in fact,  i would call the crafting basic and the building a little less than bacis (not bad,  just basic).   I wouldn't pay more than 20 bucks for it at the current build.  Would like to see more 'survival',  once you gear up a bit 'survival' is pretty much a non-issue.   The winter storms are a pretty nice touch.\n\nWould also like to see alot more crafting recipes.  For me the game will need alot more crafting.

Little kids came onto my server and began taking some of my hard earned high quality ores and etc.\n- Would love to have an easier time finding dire bears.  Looked on the forums and wiki to find that people say that dire bears spawn on the eastern side of the island.  My friend and I trecked across the fairly uninteresting landscape to the eastern side, only to camp out for 4 days and nights without encountering even a single dire bear.  Would like to have the spawn rate for them increased please,  or have increased spawn rate at night.\n\nOther than these few minor gripes, the game seems to have a lot of potential.

This makes it easier to make an inventory inside a house.\n- The UI is clean, the tutorial straight forward and easy to follow.\n- Night/Day Cycle is longer, you have enough time to farm, mine and craft.\n- Very good crafting system and overall much usage of items found/harvested.\n- Wacky Skellingtons (Yes, they are wacky.)\n- Developers pay attention towards it's player-base and frequently asks for feedback and on what they can improve. (HARDLY ANY GAME DOES THAT)\n- A huge variety in monster selection. (Ranging from skellies to wolves, even a dragon.)\n\nCons:\n- The map is dull and gets boring easly, ie; Lack of content. (Devs could focus on adding more content, the map is huge. don't hold back.)\n- Wonky combat system.\n\nOverall it's a good game, certainly worth the money.","August 4, 2015","true","5.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","3"

Map: Especially in a game where you can die from the cold, its nice to know where a fire is. I'm sure I eventually will be able to make one anywhere with the right materials, but there is nothing telling me how at the start.\n\n2. Tutorial: What is there now is just a to do list.  I can tell the red bar is health, but what the blue and yellow bars are? I found out online, but I feel a game should teach you the basic UI via in-game tutorial. Gone are the days of manuals, and alt-tabbing out to Google, YouTube, etc. ruins the immersion of the game.  I realize this is a survival game, so something quick and simple so we aren't taking our focus off the experience itself.\n\nI feel these features could help get players into the game quicker, and help reduce frustration by making navigation more predictable.\n\n\nReview edited as I felt it sounded too negative :)","August 5, 2015","true","1.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

The glowingly positive reviews that I've read along with the occasional person gushing on the forum about how much they like this game, along with people comparing it to Skyrim more than The Forest, all added up to my taking the plunge to purchase it on sale for 8 dollars. It turns out that the game is far better than what I expected. The only thing about the game that is vaguely similar to The Forest are the ghost-images of structures that have been placed but not finished. That's really it. Everything else, especially the overarching vibe of the game, is very, very different, and wonderfully so.\n\nI will say that it's the most bang per buck game that I've enountered on Steam.  If this game is on sale, I can't recommend it highly enough.","August 11, 2015","true","16.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","1"

It is a game in progress but has a lot of content in store at such an early state. This is a Different survival game and is not a copy of an other. It is progressing fast and has a lovely selection of medieval era mystery. I like it alot, one thing would impress me is if they used action combat- war of the roses/skyrim, which would stand out and give the weapons more realism, depth, and fun; you could even apply that to cutting trees.

Little kids came onto my server and began taking some of my hard earned high quality ores and etc.\n- Would love to have an easier time finding dire bears.  Looked on the forums and wiki to find that people say that dire bears spawn on the eastern side of the island.  My friend and I trecked across the fairly uninteresting landscape to the eastern side, only to camp out for 4 days and nights without encountering even a single dire bear.  Would like to have the spawn rate for them increased please,  or have increased spawn rate at night.\n\nOther than these few minor gripes, the game seems to have a lot of potential.

MP and SP so far are both entertaining. It is like Skyrim meets The Long Dark.\nHunger, cold ( COLD!!! ) critters.. and of course.. A mutha' of a Dragon.\nOnline offers 'Friendly' and 'Hostile' game servers.\nYou can simply die from not watching your cold, but you will know your cold.\nCurrently only schniepel holding characters. ( male )\nMissing a few animations.. like you eat your bandage when applying.\nOverall totally worth it though.\nIf you want to play online, I suggest you try it now, before everyone starts just killing everyone else.. as always happens.\nBTW. NO GUNS. NO MAKING NUCLEAR POWERED WEAPONS IN A STONE PILE WITH BUBBLEGUM.\nPure Medieval tech.\nEnjoy!\nEDIT: Should add some info about crafting / etc.\nFirst, you learn to craft things by finding advanced materials, or finding 'things'.\nFor example, on building the blacksmith, you can now create various ores. When you do that, you can now create higher end items... and so on.\nLevels, there are none. No worry over xp's and leveling a character. Its toughen up as you go!\nInventory. Its actually pretty easy to deal with, and like the ol' soldiers bag of bags. You have an inventory box, in that you can put things, or bags. Your bags are in a box below, in order. So you can sort your inventory by item type etc. The only annoying thing to me, if your hotbar has an open slot and you pick up something it jumps there. I forgot that a few times and just didnt look at the hotbar out of 'for♥♥♥♥♥ing' and was scratching my head looking for something... duh.\nGraphics. Not to bad at all. I ve mostly been playing on a laptop, and have zero load issue, zero frame freezes, your character in inventory window is very crisp and detailed, the game itself is very sharp, with a hint of 'blur' as a way of replicating the weather of frost / freezing.  I actually expect that will enhance as we go, but its very nice at the moment.\nEnjoy!","September 13, 2015","true","21.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","5"

In the 27 hours I've played, I managed to craft the best armor and get the best weapons in the game. It's rather dissapointing to be honest. Food is easily manageable so long as you find a deer or what have you. The cold is easy to manage as well, all you need is wood, stone and flint and voila, campfire. I can see how it would be difficult at first for some, but I found it rather easy, like I said, I have the best of everything in the game after 27 hours. It's a bit boring now, I've killed all the bosses barring Kur, the dragon, and there's just not much to do to be quite honest. The game is worth 50 hours of gameplay max right now if you know what you're doing. There are no quests other than killing the 5 or so skeleton bosses. Combat is rather plain as well, but can be difficult when fighting bears or forest giants or any of the bosses. Other than that, if you're well equipped, you'll mow down everything without losing any health. Resource gathering is easy, but tedious, most of my time playing was spent gathering materials for armor and such. Back to combat, like I said it's rather plain and the attack animations are nothing to right home about. There are no shields and you cannot block whatsoever, the archery isn't all that great and there is only one bow as it stands, no crossbows, spears or the like. You're limited to mostly one handed swords, especially the high end gear; it's all one handed swords. There are a few axes and maces, but the weapon variety could be more varied. Shields and a blocking mechanic would definitely spruce up combat, perhaps. Now that I'm thinking about it, theres so much disparity between being well equipped and not being equipped as such. For example, the savage wolf armor I wear for the most part allows me to take on huge groups of wolves without losing any health, but when I first fought a wolf with just basic clothing and a primitive axe I almost died. Now, I know you want to rewarded for your efforts in getting good gear, but the disparity from fighting one wolf and almost dying early on to easily spanking ten or more without getting hurt is a little much. Overall, the game has a lot of potential just as others have said and as of right now, if you go in alone it will net a player around 50 hours or so of gametime if I were to guess, which isn't half bad. There just needs to be more to do, combat could be made a little more interesting and more difficult when at higher levels of gear, crafting could possibly be a little more difficult as well. Through and through it's a solid game to invest a little time in so far.","August 23, 2015","true","27.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","2"

I was blown away on one Thursday, I decided, Hey why don't I stop being a scrooge? Well. I did and the stream surprised me, Instead of devs just talking about their game, They were talking to people in the stream, They acted like your average gamer and it really surprised me because they had heart for their game instead of being like boring and wanting money, They wanted the experience of meeting different people. They were very open about questions and didn't really hide much from the players. They even opened up a server which everyone wanted to join but sadly it got full and some people got sad, So I decided to be nice in said stream and give the studio games to hand out to people. But the game's community and playing is very very fun, Quite excellent in fact. Let's get into it shall we?\n\n\n2.\nThe contact with the developers is very very open, They are just gamers with a developing studio practically. They created a great game in the past but they just show what game industry should be. Don't be afraid to help them out by going on their community or their streams and ask questions. They are very kind!\n\n3.\nMy opinion on gameplay is the fact it's changing every aspect of a normal RPG, This game brought a new context to fantasy, Realistic Fantasy. This showed how one would survive in a harsh fantasy world and try to be a great warrior at the same time. Just trying to make a living on the isle. It created it's own new genre, It's a survival fantasy game. It's savage lands. It's own thing. The best way to describe it fully is get the game, It is worth the price! It is worth the fun! It is hard but playing with friends who have just makes it better. Now the cons in my opinion I hate. This game is still be worked on but heres the thing I have an issue with.. It's some of the multiplayer bugs and the voice chat. Trust me the voice chat literally sounds like Darth Vader had the voice of Sean Connery. It's bad but it will be fixed hopefully. But the game overall gets my seal of approval. The Osiris Badass Award.\n\n4. Should you buy it or not?\n\nWell if you like these kind of games YES! Unlike most early access games it is actually a very fair price, They gotta make money for it's development but they show they do care. They will make your dollar worth more every Thursday, They usually release updates every Thursday too! They tell you about upcoming ones as well! But it's worth buying if you have the money. It is a bunch of fun and scary. It has regained trust for me for early access games. This game personally helped me through some dark times by making me feel better. It's given me fun memories for me and my friends. It was a game I've been waiting for personally and it's here. This game is a worth to try and you will not regret once you see what your up againest. I won't spoil everything. You gotta play for yourself to truly know savage lands.

I played for a while, built a fire, built a shelter, and died a lot. You starve very quickly so you almost constantly have to be scavenging or hunting for food. And if that doesn't kill you, the cold will. If the cold doesn't kill you, all your tools will break, you won't be able to find any rocks to build new tools, and you'll just have to start over. There are no ranged weapons (yet) so if you want to try to kill a deer or something, good luck. I chased a deer around, hit it about 5 or 6 times, until it zoomed out across the water like a motorboat. I went out chasing it and froze to death. Then I yelled at the game and closed it.\n\nSorry, this game isn't ready yet. It still needs a lot more before it can even be considered a "game". All the elements are there, you collect stone, chop trees, craft tools, fight monsters, and try to survive. But it's just not fun. It's like... what's the point? Once you get a shelter built you can keep building fires, gathering stones and wood, and killing monsters, but then what? That's the problem with almost all of these sandbox survival type games (including Minecraft). They just don't seem to have any purpose. There's no leveling system, no emergent AI (as far as I can tell), you just run around hunting, eating, and building fires.\n\nAnother big problem with games like this is they're very grindy. It takes forever to get established, and once you do, you're back to the first problem, no sense of direction, no feeling of accomplishment, no "game".\n\nI like the journal system, it tells you what to do to get started. Collect x number of rocks and logs, craft this and that, find such and such, and as you do these things you get a nice gong sound giving you feedback. That's good! That's what games like this need. If they build on that, give more objectives, add in some random dynamic events (emergent AI) so you have some concrete goals to strive towards, add a leveling system, add some ranged weapons, maybe even some magic, and a CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION SYSTEM (male/female, clothing and hair options), then this game will be awesome. Multiplayer Skyrim.\n\nBut for right now, it's just not there yet. It's fairly smooth and polished, but if you're buying this game expecting a good time right out of the box, you're going to be disappointed. I'm going to keep my eye on it though and give it a thumbs up because at least it has nice graphics and it's more PVE focused than most, but I'm going to have to hold my nose while doing it because while I can't recommend this game, I must. At least it's not Rust!","March 10, 2015","true","3.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

My recommendation is based on the below:\n\n- Learning curve is fairly sharp to start.  You are literally dropped on a beach with minimal supplies and then you figure out the rest on your own.  I personally like that style of gaming, but it may not be for all.\n\n- The developers are very active.  They are continually adding content and fixing bugs all over.  With that said, the game is early enough in development that the game can turn out to be an awesome survival game or a complete flop without any depth.  Time will tell.\n\n- Modding is on the table, but they have not decided on adding support for this yet.  This will be a deciding factor for me in the long-run.  Mods can add a lot of depth and speed the creation of assets that might have taken developers months or years to get to (if they add them at all).  This game is positioned very well to support modding so we will see.\n\n- Player base is committed and active on the boards and trello (a voting site where you can vote for the features you want to see next).\n\nIf you like survival games and are willing to contribute to the development of the game, you will find an active community and get in on the ground floor of a potentially great game.  If you are expecting a full-fledged game with story and list of to-dos, you might want to wait a few months and check back.\n\nHappy hunting!\n\n","May 24, 2015","true","10.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

And sometimes when you kill a boar you can't loot it (not a big problem since boars are everywhere) and the game needs more spawn of cotton in random areas (there are cotton farms but still..) and I hope server lags and frame drops will be fixed.

Also should really have some form of an increasing invasion mode.

Although the game shows promise there are many lacking features but contains some decent features aswell. I am banking the 20 Bucks I speant on this game for it to be worth it when its finished.\n\nPros\n- Has alot of potential for being a much better game but right now its lacking.\n- Community is amazingly helpful to new players\n- Devs are making updates to fix problems around every 12 days.\n- Easy to Repair Weapons which is VERY helpful\n- Playing with friends makes the game so much more fun and better all around. I do not think you should buy this game if you plan on playing alone.\nCons\n- "Advanced Creature AI - Every creature in Savage Lands will be powered by a unique AI system complete with line of sight, collision avoidance, situational awareness, and pack mentality designed to bring the world to life. " (*Sneezes* cuz im allergic to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T) The AI for anything in the game is horrible. ex. You can dry hump anything from the back and not have them attack or run from you. Even if the game is early access it should atleast have a slightly better AI then this ♥♥♥♥. I could jump a pack of wolves one by one when they were 1 foot away from each other and none of them notice.\n- The learning curve for the game is a bit higher than other survivals because you have to worry about 3 different things, Warmth, Health, and Food.\n- The more you play a world the harder it becomes to gain resources since Trees and Rocks do not replenish\n- If you do not have friends to play with, the game becomes very boring\n- Some items do not have their own icon (Minor Problem but seeing where they are in the game, I feel they should have fixed this before adding an item)\n- You need a decently strong computer to play the game with a decent FPS at the lowest settings\n- Lack of content (currently)\n","August 29, 2015","true","17.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","1"

Now I'm not saying that a lot of work to that end would be nessessary, but something, anything, to point you back to that respawn point that you can build (short pole with 3-4 skulls on it) would be really nice.

Around the launch of the public alpha I was a bit skeptical if this would really come together into a game with staying power. I liked their refreshing take on some of the more tired survival concepts, but it felt rough on a lot of fronts and some of the mechanics were overly burdensome (like 10 hammer swings per ore drop, yeesh).\n\nThe developers have really come through for us, though. Every system has had a bit of polish and a new coat of paint. The game at it's core has not changed much, but pretty much all the little annoyances and bugs have been ironed out. Movement and combat feels very good now, gathering is much more fun and engaging, FPS is significantly more stable and the post processing and general graphical look is better. With the improvements made in the last 6 months or so, I really can't wait to see where this game goes. As it is, it is worth it's sticker price for sure.

I like the layout and so far the items that CAN be crafted seem to be pretty cool. But why is it so hard to find a wood stick in the middle of a forest? This game seems like it would be a lot more fun if some resources (at least the basic ones) were more abundant. It gets pretty boring when you're running around for nearly an hour looking for something as simple as sticks, hoping a wolf doesnt come along and take out half my health while I try to punch it to death. If some of these small balancing issues were fixed (along with the sometimes annoying and slowvframerate) this game could really shape up to be an impressive one.","March 17, 2015","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nuclearpheasant/recommended/307880/","Nuclearpheasant","☃Lori","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nuclearpheasant/","183 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game, in the simplest explaination, a single player version of Rust. It is not quite the same as rust though. There are many differences from this game and Rust that makes it better and worse. First of all, you don't have the same building freedoms that you do in Rust. You choose a building, get the supplies, build it, and thats it. This makes it simpler to do things but a little boring. I would love if they added a thing where you can put furniture in your buildings or something to that extent so you don't have such empty buildings. Second of all, it is less realistic than Rust. Rust is based on a post-nuclear war where there are old towns with radiation and bears and wolves and stuff. This however has many monsters which can make it both more fun and less fun.\n\nGoing into gameplay. This game can be difficult because you need stone which involves going far from the beach and coming back so the stone spawns. That is the simplest way I have found to get stone (unless you have a hammer). The problem with this is that if you die you will have to find your stuff or start over. This means having no weapon. This makes it very difficult to get more stone to make a weapon. You must risk dying again to either get your stuff back or go far enough so all the stone respawns on the beach. Other than this the game is challenging but still fun.\n\nAll around this is a good game for an early access game. I am hoping to see more things added as well as improvements to the game mechanics. I bought it while it was on sale for 10 dollars. I would not recommend buying it for the normal 25 dollars unless you just have money to throw around. It is a great game that I would recommend but not for 25 dollars.

The graphics are rather simple with basic textures and meshes, some sounds are rather simplistic in places with numerous placeholders (at least I'm assuming, and hoping), there's clearly a lot of content yet to be developed, and the whole experience is very rough around the edges.\n\nHowever, despite this very early stage Savage Lands already offers an wonderful immersive experience, which for me is the most important thing when it comes to a game. Light filters through the leaves on the trees during sunrises and sunsets, the howl of the bitter winter wind dies away as you walk inside a building only to escalate again as you step outside, eating food staves off hunger AND helps to generate essential body heat (a very nice, realistic touch that surprised me when I started to play). Animals make noises all around you in the woodland as deer betray their position to the keen hunter inside you, and wolves howl into the frigid night giving you a chilling reminder of the ever present threat that envelopes you on Sundered Isle. All of these draw you into the world of Savage Lands. The experience further pulls you into its world as the nightime suddenly transforms the already-hostile world into one that's even harsher and less forgiving. Creatures that are far more vicious (and even ghostly) start roaming the landscape once the Sun has disappeared, and your body temperature plummets at an alarming rate. Seeking refuge before nightfall and ensuring you have plenty of fuel for the fire are strong recommendations in this unforgiving world.\n\nThe crafting system is very satisfying, such that you feel a genuine sense of achievement and progress when you craft a completely new or better item. For example, hunting deer becomes a lot easier and more fun once you've crafted a bow and arrows. Another aspect of crafting that's really pleased me is the ability to produce different pouches, bags, and rucksacks to increase the size of your inventory - AND the fact that you can have more than just one of them. This greatly increases the loot potential when you venture out into the wilds exploring.\n\nThe game has a lot of potential and I've had good fun playing the entire time so far. So for the moment - with the caveat that this is very early alpha - I'm going to recommend Savage Lands.\n\nI will be updating this review over the coming months as the developers roll out new updates. Things I would really need to see in the game in the future include:\n- A more developed combat system that offers more attack types, blocking (which requires precise timing and aiming), and the introuction of shields into the game.\n- More weapons to craft, especially progressively more powerful bows to manufacture, two-handed weapons, and also spears for longer range thrusting attacks and for throwing.\n- Unique places to explore e.g. caves, rock faces and crevasses (and other unique geological features).\n- Some sort of levelling up or research system that unlocks more advanced craftables and buildings as you progress through the game.\n- Extra building options (free-form construction would be great) to develop a base building aspect to the game.\n\nWith continued love and attention from the developers I can see Savage Lands turning into a real gem of a survival game. Definitely worth keeping an eye on if not buying right now. Happy surviving!","November 8, 2015","true","7.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I came with friends, but after wandering the coastline I see only salvage and more smashed boats. I can only hope they went on without me. As I pick up an axe I recognise too well, I push the thoughts of my brothers out of my mind. We crossed the sea to escape the blight that befell our town - the undead and other creatures of the night still haunt my dreams. No more could we repel their relentless attacks. Alas, seeing city ruins and hearing a thunderous cry echo through the land, I begin to doubt the decisions of the elders.\n\nWhile trekking up the mountain I make quick work of the boars and wolves along the way. I fashion a lean-to and make a fire, but as I hear the beating of heavy wings, I quickly extinguish it to avoid the flying lizard that just passed overhead. The smoke lingers, and the creature double backs and lays waste to my camp. I sprint blindly forwards until my lungs can't take me any further, my tattered cloth giving little protection against the burning foliage I'm consumed by. After diving into a warehouse next to a small building, it seems I have lost it. I'll make camp here for the night. Perhaps I can regrow this into a village similar to one of home over the coming days.\n\n---\n\nI want to go on, because so much more happened in those 2 hours. I had to leave in the middle of the night to find more food; deers constantly springing away at the last second as hunger constantly threatens me. Awesome. After finding some food and berries, my torch blew out and I had lost my sense of direction in my chase. I spent 20 minutes getting gradually more and more desperate until my health started to rapidly decline from the cold. I make it back to camp with just 10% health left. Awesome.\n\nI died from ambush of wolves while mining Awesome.. But this time when I trekked back up to camp, I came across an abandoned dragon village. Awesome. Were these worshippers? Where did they go? What was in the dragons tower? The village had something very eerie about it. I grabbed the bow and began hunting deer like the nordic warrior I imagined myself to be. Awesome. After learning to chop down trees behind me to create a path, walking slowly to not startle deers, I was having good success. Then, after killing the dears I make my way back to camp; 5 wolves spring onto my back and kill me again! Awesome.\n\nA thank you to the developers\nGuys, that was an incredible experience. The desperation and raw situation you put us in make it extremely immersive to me. The environment was different, but realistic enough to get lost in incredibly easily. The wildlife was intimidating, the howling wind, branch snapping and bush rustling had me on edge constantly. The dragon village had some nice environmental story telling, and overall it just made one of the most immersive fantasy experiences I've had. There's a lot of room for imagination, which can be a wonderful thing for some games.\n\nPros- Optimised well*, I don't have a great PC but it ran great on the highest settings.\n- Immersive, realistic environment both visually and audibly.\n- Great bleak atmosphere, I felt every emotion my character might.\n- It's difficult, but that's also a con\n- Use of cold felt particularly real\n\nCons- Inventory management is not good.\n- That survivors guide felt kinda tacky, but I appreciate you've put it in to help players, which is also a much needed thing\n- No inbuilt controller support\n- On first impressions, the world feels empty. The "inbetween bits" are samey, which helps realism but detracts from the experience. Additionally, the focal points aren't interactable: the dragons tower was just that, a pillar of stone that you couldn't even climb to the top with.\n- Nothing that distinguishes it mechanically from other games in the survival genre (setting though was great)\n\n* I read some other reviews that said optimisation was a problem. I played solo locally but didn't build a lot. Lots of buildings and/or players might change the running of the game.\n\nTL;DRThis game is rough around the edges to say the least. The UI is horrible, and it's incredibly difficult to orient yourself. It's not clear how the craft system works and gathering materials is a bit of a pain. Survival games tend to be immersive by their nature, but this is the only one I've seen based on a fantasy setting, and boy does it deliver on that (based on first impressions). I doubt I'll play this a lot more, but I certainly enjoyed that experience - I look forward to the finished product.","November 7, 2015","true","2.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I spent the first night with a new character cowering in a make shift shack I built while two Plague Wolves circled around it, waiting to devour me if I stepped out side.  I also love the fact there's no in game map, it makes exploration much more fun and rewarding.  There's a fair number of land marks you can use to find your way around and there's also a crude compass that can be crafted.

I really hope they add some sort of crop growing system in future, as it'd at least provide a break from slaughtering the islands natural inhabitants for sustenance (Plus seriously its an island = limited supply of game to chew up).\n\nCOMBAT: Pretty simple really, like Skyrim, using a bow is satisfying when you get the hang of it. No shields, or parry, so you just have to dodge by stepping backwards etc. I hope it gets a bit more advanced in future as I expect it will, as this would also be a bonus for PvP when/if anyone decides to engage in that sorta stuff.\n\nMOBS/BADGUYS: Like in every game they can get a bit dull a bit quickly, plus, aside from the odd wolf pack, duo of bears, or party of heavily armed skelebobs (who only spawn in certain locations) I wouldn't say the mobs are hard, more a nuisance, that if you let your guard down will hurt you. Though very interesting, and certainly more is planned, I'm hoping that mobs become far more threatening to the player in future. By that I mean, they actively hunt players, and not just spawn in place and randomly patrol about. It'd be awesome if the game would occasionally send a large pack of skeletons, or even new deadlier creatures to haunt/attack player camps. Perhaps even have it so some use stealth to pick players of, whilst others just lay siege to villages. Perhaps other events/happenings where something emerges from outside the island etc at random points, just to keep us on our toes.\n\nONLINE: Game is best played this way IMO. When persistent servers needs to be added, alongside greater controls for hosts (say prevent players griefing/stealing others buildings or belongings) it would be excellent. When I first hosted my own server it became full pretty rapidly, and people began building their own shacks/houses next to mine to the extent a sizeable village had sprouted up. Coming back to a busy camp with people coming and going was just brilliant! We often traded, brought in goods from other servers etc, and went out to help newbies at night find their way their. Its also why I hope in future bands of mobs will attempt to rush and kill players in their camps, it'd definitly develop a new dynamic survival wise.\n\nDRAGON: He's cool, don't go near him.\n\n\n\n","August 22, 2015","true","24.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The content is definitely on the light side of things currently and I won't lie, you definitely are buying into the potential rather than the current situation - it's an early access game so that should not be a shock.\n\nThe physics aren't perfect and the mechanics of crafting/exploring/gathering require some getting used to but I've had good fun running around the map with a friend. Going on little missions to find new areas, attacking enemies we aren't ready for and getting lost in the process.

The ramp up isn't as hard as other survival games. It's probably the first survival game with a tutorial in the beginning. The community is awesome. The game is designed where it is beneficial for players to help each other. For example, killing giants takes a group of people. The recipes aren't hard to figure out. Building houses is unique compared to other survival games.

I really hope they add some sort of crop growing system in future, as it'd at least provide a break from slaughtering the islands natural inhabitants for sustenance (Plus seriously its an island = limited supply of game to chew up).\n\nCOMBAT: Pretty simple really, like Skyrim, using a bow is satisfying when you get the hang of it. No shields, or parry, so you just have to dodge by stepping backwards etc. I hope it gets a bit more advanced in future as I expect it will, as this would also be a bonus for PvP when/if anyone decides to engage in that sorta stuff.\n\nMOBS/BADGUYS: Like in every game they can get a bit dull a bit quickly, plus, aside from the odd wolf pack, duo of bears, or party of heavily armed skelebobs (who only spawn in certain locations) I wouldn't say the mobs are hard, more a nuisance, that if you let your guard down will hurt you. Though very interesting, and certainly more is planned, I'm hoping that mobs become far more threatening to the player in future. By that I mean, they actively hunt players, and not just spawn in place and randomly patrol about. It'd be awesome if the game would occasionally send a large pack of skeletons, or even new deadlier creatures to haunt/attack player camps. Perhaps even have it so some use stealth to pick players of, whilst others just lay siege to villages. Perhaps other events/happenings where something emerges from outside the island etc at random points, just to keep us on our toes.\n\nONLINE: Game is best played this way IMO. When persistent servers needs to be added, alongside greater controls for hosts (say prevent players griefing/stealing others buildings or belongings) it would be excellent. When I first hosted my own server it became full pretty rapidly, and people began building their own shacks/houses next to mine to the extent a sizeable village had sprouted up. Coming back to a busy camp with people coming and going was just brilliant! We often traded, brought in goods from other servers etc, and went out to help newbies at night find their way their. Its also why I hope in future bands of mobs will attempt to rush and kill players in their camps, it'd definitly develop a new dynamic survival wise.\n\nDRAGON: He's cool, don't go near him.\n\n\n\n","August 22, 2015","true","24.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

This is, of course, in the Early Access release. I have to start off with, "Wow!" It is not often that an Early Access game is with well off. I have not encountered any game breaking bugs that make the game unplayable in its current status. I have, however, had it crash to desktop twice. I believe this is partly due to my insane hours of play in one sit down and possibly an error on my side (I'll post it in an edit here if I encounter it again).\n\nOverall though, here are my thoughts on Savage lands besides the obvious: it is an awesome start to something great.\n\nThe GoodFor early access, the game is quite developed as far as graphics and interfacing with objects. There is a challenge in the begining and getting used to the system and how to survive, but after that, you can explore to your hearts content and try and tackle larger foes.\n\nI really enjoy the idea that my friends and I can make a community (houses, town hall, etc.) and advanture together in a crazy survival or be killed by foes, the weather, or maybe even a dragon. It really is a great start for what I like in games with my friends.\n\nThe BadWhile the list is small and generally things that I would like to see put in the game in the future, I really don't have any real negative feedback\n\nUnable to lock doors from other players.\nUnable to lock chests from other players.\nBeing able to "draw" a map of areas you have explored would be helpful with navigation.\nRemove names from friendly people (while it is awesome, it also takes away some of the "find your friends and brave the lands" feel).","August 9, 2015","true","20.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The graphics are rather simple with basic textures and meshes, some sounds are rather simplistic in places with numerous placeholders (at least I'm assuming, and hoping), there's clearly a lot of content yet to be developed, and the whole experience is very rough around the edges.\n\nHowever, despite this very early stage Savage Lands already offers an wonderful immersive experience, which for me is the most important thing when it comes to a game. Light filters through the leaves on the trees during sunrises and sunsets, the howl of the bitter winter wind dies away as you walk inside a building only to escalate again as you step outside, eating food staves off hunger AND helps to generate essential body heat (a very nice, realistic touch that surprised me when I started to play). Animals make noises all around you in the woodland as deer betray their position to the keen hunter inside you, and wolves howl into the frigid night giving you a chilling reminder of the ever present threat that envelopes you on Sundered Isle. All of these draw you into the world of Savage Lands. The experience further pulls you into its world as the nightime suddenly transforms the already-hostile world into one that's even harsher and less forgiving. Creatures that are far more vicious (and even ghostly) start roaming the landscape once the Sun has disappeared, and your body temperature plummets at an alarming rate. Seeking refuge before nightfall and ensuring you have plenty of fuel for the fire are strong recommendations in this unforgiving world.\n\nThe crafting system is very satisfying, such that you feel a genuine sense of achievement and progress when you craft a completely new or better item. For example, hunting deer becomes a lot easier and more fun once you've crafted a bow and arrows. Another aspect of crafting that's really pleased me is the ability to produce different pouches, bags, and rucksacks to increase the size of your inventory - AND the fact that you can have more than just one of them. This greatly increases the loot potential when you venture out into the wilds exploring.\n\nThe game has a lot of potential and I've had good fun playing the entire time so far. So for the moment - with the caveat that this is very early alpha - I'm going to recommend Savage Lands.\n\nI will be updating this review over the coming months as the developers roll out new updates. Things I would really need to see in the game in the future include:\n- A more developed combat system that offers more attack types, blocking (which requires precise timing and aiming), and the introuction of shields into the game.\n- More weapons to craft, especially progressively more powerful bows to manufacture, two-handed weapons, and also spears for longer range thrusting attacks and for throwing.\n- Unique places to explore e.g. caves, rock faces and crevasses (and other unique geological features).\n- Some sort of levelling up or research system that unlocks more advanced craftables and buildings as you progress through the game.\n- Extra building options (free-form construction would be great) to develop a base building aspect to the game.\n\nWith continued love and attention from the developers I can see Savage Lands turning into a real gem of a survival game. Definitely worth keeping an eye on if not buying right now. Happy surviving!","November 8, 2015","true","7.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I came with friends, but after wandering the coastline I see only salvage and more smashed boats. I can only hope they went on without me. As I pick up an axe I recognise too well, I push the thoughts of my brothers out of my mind. We crossed the sea to escape the blight that befell our town - the undead and other creatures of the night still haunt my dreams. No more could we repel their relentless attacks. Alas, seeing city ruins and hearing a thunderous cry echo through the land, I begin to doubt the decisions of the elders.\n\nWhile trekking up the mountain I make quick work of the boars and wolves along the way. I fashion a lean-to and make a fire, but as I hear the beating of heavy wings, I quickly extinguish it to avoid the flying lizard that just passed overhead. The smoke lingers, and the creature double backs and lays waste to my camp. I sprint blindly forwards until my lungs can't take me any further, my tattered cloth giving little protection against the burning foliage I'm consumed by. After diving into a warehouse next to a small building, it seems I have lost it. I'll make camp here for the night. Perhaps I can regrow this into a village similar to one of home over the coming days.\n\n---\n\nI want to go on, because so much more happened in those 2 hours. I had to leave in the middle of the night to find more food; deers constantly springing away at the last second as hunger constantly threatens me. Awesome. After finding some food and berries, my torch blew out and I had lost my sense of direction in my chase. I spent 20 minutes getting gradually more and more desperate until my health started to rapidly decline from the cold. I make it back to camp with just 10% health left. Awesome.\n\nI died from ambush of wolves while mining Awesome.. But this time when I trekked back up to camp, I came across an abandoned dragon village. Awesome. Were these worshippers? Where did they go? What was in the dragons tower? The village had something very eerie about it. I grabbed the bow and began hunting deer like the nordic warrior I imagined myself to be. Awesome. After learning to chop down trees behind me to create a path, walking slowly to not startle deers, I was having good success. Then, after killing the dears I make my way back to camp; 5 wolves spring onto my back and kill me again! Awesome.\n\nA thank you to the developers\nGuys, that was an incredible experience. The desperation and raw situation you put us in make it extremely immersive to me. The environment was different, but realistic enough to get lost in incredibly easily. The wildlife was intimidating, the howling wind, branch snapping and bush rustling had me on edge constantly. The dragon village had some nice environmental story telling, and overall it just made one of the most immersive fantasy experiences I've had. There's a lot of room for imagination, which can be a wonderful thing for some games.\n\nPros- Optimised well*, I don't have a great PC but it ran great on the highest settings.\n- Immersive, realistic environment both visually and audibly.\n- Great bleak atmosphere, I felt every emotion my character might.\n- It's difficult, but that's also a con\n- Use of cold felt particularly real\n\nCons- Inventory management is not good.\n- That survivors guide felt kinda tacky, but I appreciate you've put it in to help players, which is also a much needed thing\n- No inbuilt controller support\n- On first impressions, the world feels empty. The "inbetween bits" are samey, which helps realism but detracts from the experience. Additionally, the focal points aren't interactable: the dragons tower was just that, a pillar of stone that you couldn't even climb to the top with.\n- Nothing that distinguishes it mechanically from other games in the survival genre (setting though was great)\n\n* I read some other reviews that said optimisation was a problem. I played solo locally but didn't build a lot. Lots of buildings and/or players might change the running of the game.\n\nTL;DRThis game is rough around the edges to say the least. The UI is horrible, and it's incredibly difficult to orient yourself. It's not clear how the craft system works and gathering materials is a bit of a pain. Survival games tend to be immersive by their nature, but this is the only one I've seen based on a fantasy setting, and boy does it deliver on that (based on first impressions). I doubt I'll play this a lot more, but I certainly enjoyed that experience - I look forward to the finished product.","November 7, 2015","true","2.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's Alpha so don't expect much, but there are definitely things to do in the game to keep you occupied.  There was a recent update, but I'm not too sure how frequent updates come out.  This game sorta fills my Ultima Online void that i've been missing.  Its still too early, but if they did some tweaking, this game would be great.\n\nDEV, in case you see this, here are my suggestions for the game:\n\n- Make more lands with different weather, animals, etc.  Even if going to the next land requires an instance and needs to be loaded.\n- Introduce skills into the game.  No leveling, simple skill base.  You hack a tree, you gain Lumberjacking.  You hit a rock, you gain Mining.\n- Introduce fishing and lakes/ponds.\n- Boats!  get some boat crafting in this game once you have the ability to travel lands.\n\n\nNot sure if this game will EVER get this far, but, I sure hope it does.\n\nTLDR - Would I recommend?

I also love the fact there's no in game map, it makes exploration much more fun and rewarding.

There are a few feedbacks that I hope the developers will take time to read :)\n\nI think that a larger selection of hostile entities, more terrain variety (I think new maps will most likely be added in the future), A server hosting system at some point like minecraft where you have a permanent server that is up (whitelisted perhaps) and people can join, more options for adventuring and exploring like caves and the dragon's tower maybe with loot to be found in places like the village would add very very much to the gameplay experience. Obviously there will be more items added and maybe things like neutral NPCs. AND HERE MY MOST IMPORTANT RECCOMENDATION. The ability to terraform an area and BUILD WALLS LIKE A VILLAGE FOR SERVERS. Without terraforming currently the only way to bulid a halfway decent house is to build it in the village that alrealy has flat ground where you won't be able to peek under the walls and where you don't feel like a savage because your floor is the snowy grass.","March 31, 2015","true","30.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I finally bought it a few days ago, despite all the recent negative reviews about it on steam. So far, I'm not dissapointed that I bought it, but yes it does have negatives which should be mentioned.\n\nPros and what I really like about it:\n+Sounds: The creepy factor is really well executed. You'll  never feel safe when exploring or gathering resources.\n+Atmosphere: Snowstorms are surprisingly "nothing-you-can-do-about-it" but sit and wait for it to pass. Also the night is definitely a hindrance to exploring, and brings a risk vs reward factor.\n+Creatures: I can't emphasize enough how this game will wash away any past RPG experience where you play as warrior and just run into the battle no matter what. Let me tell you my experience so far. A couple of times in the beginning I was running for my life from 4 wolves, and if I didn't have like 10 bandages which I thankfully prepared I would've died for sure. Even 1 wolf can do massive damage if you don't dodge properly. Today, I finally made it to the second island, only to get my first taste of death at the sword of a undead warrior skeleton. His blade effortlessly sliced through my tin armor in just 1 hit and I was dead.\n+Crafting/Building: I like the interface, and how you can place anything even if you don't have materials for it. It's the first game I played where the buildings are premade, but surprisingly I don't mind. Before I bought this game I thought it would be a minus because I'm used to building my own structures (like in ROK)\n+HUD: The health depends on cold, and stamina depends on hunger. I think it's tough, but enjoyable, especially when you are lost after being chased and then you realise you don't have any logs to make fire :)\n\nCons which I'm sure will be fixed or improved:\n-Lack of bow and arrow variety: At the moment there only seems to be 1 type of arrow and bow in this game, which is what you can make in the beginning.\n-Glitches: Animals walking through rocks or going underground is a bit of an issue on the second island.\n-Lag/Performance: I lowered everything to low, turned off most things but anyway I get temporary freezes, low FPS.\n\nOverall, I give this game 8/10. This game would be excellent, but performance issues right now is why I can't give it higher rating.","May 31","true","24.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I do fel like this game needs some things added to be ideal for me. but thats for me.\n\n1. EXP/Skill tree/ Perk System. don't care if its all three or just one, but getting bonusus based on acheavements you've gotten, or a level up system like a classic rpg or a mix of the two would be emencely helpful, something to make it feel rewarding to be alive, maybe some that stick with you through death and others that only accumulate and help out the longer you've been alive. or maybe pitty bonuses based on what has killed you the most and gives you temporary bonuses against said thing, all sound like good ideas to me.\n\n2. Mines, it would be nice to find a series of tunnels with enemys and increasing chances of finding thouse  precious materials we need for better weapons.\n\n3. Blocking without a shield, while I don't feel like its normaly a huge mechanic, I like to see the ability to parry/block with my weapon especially when weilding a two handed greatsword. they maybe not as much damage prevention as a shield, but would be nice.\n\n4. Improved Ranged Mechanics/ More ranged weapons, I feel like the bow and arrows I was able to make where not very effective, and didn't flow as easily with the rest of the game, maybe just my opinion though, I feel like a few added weapons like a long bow or horned bow would be a nice add, and haveing better arrows.\n\n5. fishing, just feels natural in a game like this feels like it should be added,\n\nand lastly number 6 my PERSONAL want but this is entirely a thing that I like to see in games, What  with dragons and portals and demons and all... MAGIC, as a player I love when magic is in the game, however I like when its handled a lot like kings field (if you haven't played it.. i'm sorry you missed out or are too young to appreciate aged graphics) but in short the way magic was handled then was crystals, think of scrolls you can find and consume once to learn the said spell, then you have a mana bar that determands the usual how often and if I can cast this spell. just somethign I like in games.\n\nnow with all that said, I feel like I should address that this is in no way a negitive review, the game is ♥♥♥♥♥ing more and more fluid, and its still just starting out. I hope that my suggestions as well as other alpha/beta users are heard, and that they do impliment some of these things. I've been having a blast lately and seriously suggest this title to any players that enjoy the what I call "build and survive" genre. thank you for reading, good gaming, and good luck.","May 30","true","11.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As I have only progressed to my 4th day but have built a systematic camp that has survived thus far and essentially made myself a stable base of operations. However on to my review; as saturated as the market is as of late with survival games (DayZ, The Forest, Rust etc.) The Savage Lands has many unique qualities to seperate itself from others, my favorite in particular being how cold is such a heavily enforced mechanic. I have never seen an Early access game with such committed devs to their project. Euryidium and Kittychix, especially has impressed me with their vocal manner in both the streams and their activity in forums, showing concern for the opinions and issues of others having suggestions and or difficulty with the game.

I have already made freinds playing this game, however ther is something I think should be changed.  On friendly servers players can destoy other players buildings.  A few people and I were building a "town" so to speak, one where everyone was invited to be part of our community we had built as long as they follow one rule (Dont build in the ruins so we can farm) but one person showed up destoyed our buildings so he could make his own.  After he got what he wanted he left the server.  I spoke to him about it and he said he wanted materials from the most important and difficult buildings to make.  The worst part about this is I could not stop him from doing these things.  Further more why even play on a friendly server if people can just take your stuff like that.  That kind of game play should be on a HOSTILE server not a FRIENDLY one!  So I would very kindly ask the developers to make it so that you could lock your building so others can not destoy it.  I would still like it so that players can enter and use things such as a forge and also help build the building but it can only be destoyed by the player who PLACED the building in the first place.  Note that these are only my thoughts on the matter and this is how I would start going about possibly fixing the issue if the developers should chose to resolve said matter or not.  I will rewrite my review on later updates and this issue should not judge the game for what it is.  It is a amazing game that I truely love and issues I had expected to arise for the game is still in early-access but other wise see no issues with the game and would personally say very well made especially for a early-access game.

There is no map which is good, you would not have a map of a strange island would you? Thus far I am impressed, I would like to see more content, and perhaps in the future a way to leave the island and discover a wider world. The ability to create your own map, maybe using charcoal / coal / animal blood / pigments from vegitation etc and a little hide would make it easier to get around once you have discovered things, but if this was so I think you island would become quite small.\nMy one reccomendation to the devs, don't make it any easier, keep it tough!","August 16, 2015","true","36.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Its hard in the begin when u start out but as soon as u figured out how stuff works its just a pretty relaxed game :D graphics are good, animations are a little simple but ok.\nIt has a ingame timer that will show when the next patch will come out and devs are active on the forums.\nIts easy to host a game on your own computer to play coop with some buddies or pubs can join if u want and they are mostly friendly.\nYou can also use your own character on other worlds. So first you make a character u gonna use then u join a world or create a world so u can still switch with your own character to other games with your gear on you.\nThere is no levels or anything its just pure survival and trying to get better gear to kill stronger enemies or bigger packs of wolfs.\nThe island is fairly big with only a few landmarks to find your way or with the use of a compass to navigate.\nAll in all i payed 10 euros for this game and i enjoy it more then ARK at the moment and this game will be finished in 10-12 months so i am looking forward to what it will become, and i am looking forward slaying the epic dragon that screams and flies around the map i love it :D\nthe game runs between 40-50 frames on my old i7 920 3.0ghz 18gb ram and a nvidia gtx560ti hawk edition which is pretty good performance","June 18, 2015","true","9.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

It was awesome! I went into my shack at night to let the time pass, as I went to close the door some wolves decided they were hungry and I looked like a nice snack.\nDay 2, I decided to venture inland, as I was hunting deer and almost starving to death the nice dragon decided to end my suffering by eating me. 10/10 would do again.\nDay 3, I found a player town (yes I started on a server), they were nice enough to give me some food, bags, and armor, and I ventured back out into the wilderness to claim my own land! I had a nice shiny weapon now!!! I was hunting a deer when right as I ran up to attack it a bear came out of no where and decided to eat me and the deer. someone needs to teach these animals the "finders keepers" rule..\nDay 4, I'm running around yet again trying to find a nice place to live and I found this great area, I cleared out all the trees and shrubs, rebuilt my home and a great big fire to keep me warm, apparently the fire was too big because some skeletons decided they wanted to sit by the fire too so they wandered into my camp and proceeded to wreck me and take my camp.. what lovely gentlemen.\n\nAll in all, this game is hilarious if you dont mind dying a few times to get the hang of things.

A respectably detailed environment, decent combat, a refreshing take on the gather-supplies-and-craft-things scenario we see all too often, and a beautifully harsh world that hints towards at least a moderate sense of realism.\n\nGiven, I died and I died often. But through my inevitable deaths, I learned to better adapt to the unforgiving environment and survive.\n\nThe enemies can be frightening at times, and the nights can be cold and long, but every minute I spent on the Sundered Isle was one of interest and fun. Even gathering supplies isn't dreadfully boring, like in many other games of a similar type.\n\nI spent a great deal of time exploring and fending off my camp from outsiders, while slowly gathering the supplies I needed to grow it, and felt a sense of accomplishment after having finished a building that took over an hour of game time and almost freezing to death to complete.\n\nI give Savage Lands 8/10, losing only a few points for the further depth it needs to the gameplay.

It is has your basic survival setup, health, hunger, and body heat (which is a nice touch for added realism) However this game is different due to it's dabblings in the Fantasy Genre. You won't just be killing just deer and wolves but you'll find yourself encounter the undead and dire beasts. At the start of the game we open our eyes to a very detailed world and upon only the first glance we realise what a harsh environment we are in. From the very start of the game, the clock is ticking. We only have some much time before the sunsets and the frigid night sets in. We must gather materials, however scarce they may be, and builded ourselves an encampment for the night. And each day hence will be the same sort of stuggle.\n\nNow one could say this is mash up of Skyrim and Minecraft, and I can see the comparison, however, it does the game no justice. What makes this game shine isn't the in-depth realism of survival, nor the fantastical elements of the Sundered Isle. No, no, what makes this game stand out is the potential for fear it has on whomever plays it. When I started my first game, I was terrified, and have been since. I enjoy that constant struggle and the constant looking over my shoulder. And I don't want that to change. If you can open their imagination to this game, the level of immersion you can experience is truly an enjoyable experience. The game is quite fun as-is, but we're still in the Early Access phase so there will undoubtly be several changes/additions and of course fixed bugs.

I have already made freinds playing this game, however ther is something I think should be changed.  On friendly servers players can destoy other players buildings.  A few people and I were building a "town" so to speak, one where everyone was invited to be part of our community we had built as long as they follow one rule (Dont build in the ruins so we can farm) but one person showed up destoyed our buildings so he could make his own.  After he got what he wanted he left the server.  I spoke to him about it and he said he wanted materials from the most important and difficult buildings to make.  The worst part about this is I could not stop him from doing these things.  Further more why even play on a friendly server if people can just take your stuff like that.  That kind of game play should be on a HOSTILE server not a FRIENDLY one!  So I would very kindly ask the developers to make it so that you could lock your building so others can not destoy it.  I would still like it so that players can enter and use things such as a forge and also help build the building but it can only be destoyed by the player who PLACED the building in the first place.  Note that these are only my thoughts on the matter and this is how I would start going about possibly fixing the issue if the developers should chose to resolve said matter or not.  I will rewrite my review on later updates and this issue should not judge the game for what it is.  It is a amazing game that I truely love and issues I had expected to arise for the game is still in early-access but other wise see no issues with the game and would personally say very well made especially for a early-access game.

At the start of the game we open our eyes to a very detailed world and upon only the first glance we realise what a harsh environment we are in. From the very start of the game, the clock is ticking. We only have some much time before the sunsets and the frigid night sets in. We must gather materials, however scarce they may be, and builded ourselves an encampment for the night. And each day hence will be the same sort of stuggle.\n\nNow one could say this is mash up of Skyrim and Minecraft, and I can see the comparison, however, it does the game no justice. What makes this game shine isn't the in-depth realism of survival, nor the fantastical elements of the Sundered Isle. No, no, what makes this game stand out is the potential for fear it has on whomever plays it. When I started my first game, I was terrified, and have been since. I enjoy that constant struggle and the constant looking over my shoulder. And I don't want that to change. If you can open their imagination to this game, the level of immersion you can experience is truly an enjoyable experience. The game is quite fun as-is, but we're still in the Early Access phase so there will undoubtly be several changes/additions and of course fixed bugs. Happy surviving :)\n\n","June 25, 2015","true","82.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

The community is mostly friendly with very few trolls. The ability to keep pvp turned off keeps seperate those that are looking for a team environment and those that are just looking to see who can kill who first.\nHowever at this stage in development there is very little content and you will end game very quicly and get bored with it. For the current price it might be worth it to some to buy it now and put it on the shelf for a couple months because the devs really seem to be on track to making a great game.\n\nPros:\nFun\nFriendly\nGood gameplay for early development\nGood graphics\nGood crafting system\nNice survival system\nChallenging when starting out\n\nCons:\nEnd game quickly (Within a couple weeks you will have top tier equipment and a full city)\nResources don't respawn\nGame lags whenever a new player joins or some one leaves which can get you killed\nLimited variety of enemies\nSmall map for a survival game\nHuge plot hole (If im stuck on an island and i can build a huge town hall why can't i just build a boat?)\n\nSo if the devs keep on track then this will be an awesome game. A bigger map some game play tweeks and some more content will make this a must have. In its current state if youre looking for a polished product then hold off for a while.","June 16, 2015","true","126.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

Stay away from the tower, food is the most important, and don't go out at night (you will be ♥♥♥♥ed by wolves).

And a lot of potenital which i  understand is what everyone says about EA games. Fact of the matter is, this game is way too expensive for what it gives you. I think 10-15$ is a hell of a lot more suited for this game than 21$ It has really fun elements, but for the most part its just you hitting trees, and bushes, finding a wolf or skeleton every few minutes. It's not horrible, but it's not the greatest. I don't honestly even know what to give it, a positive or a negative. I'll just give it a positive as it's a pretty decent game with some ok features.

Don`t mind this being EA, give it a try, you won`t regret it.\n\nPS. If you`re a bit concerned about this being a zombie game, no it isn`t. It is a survival game. You against nature.

But that two hours was with four other people in the server that were all friends of mine. The game has a lot of really cool features. And a lot of potenital which i  understand is what everyone says about EA games. Fact of the matter is, this game is way too expensive for what it gives you. I think 10-15$ is a hell of a lot more suited for this game than 21$ It has really fun elements, but for the most part its just you hitting trees, and bushes, finding a wolf or skeleton every few minutes. It's not horrible, but it's not the greatest. I don't honestly even know what to give it, a positive or a negative. I'll just give it a positive as it's a pretty decent game with some ok features. If i was to rate it, I'd give it a 6/10 Multiplayer is honestly the only thing that makes this game fun. Playing solo?

It's good.\n\nCouple of things wrong with it are the simple bugs and stuff, like the hostile NPC's pathing when you get on a roof top. The dragon (Kur) is kinda a ♥♥♥♥ when he is always on you if you get a little too close to the tower. (seriously, took me 30 mins to gt him away from me after dying 10 times)\n\nGood side; crafting is very easy, no need for rare crafting benches or anything. The only rare things are the items to collect for crafting into weapons and armor, but of course, is the fun side of it, the satisfaction of when you grind the land for hours to finally get that last item to make OP gear.\n\nFor an early game, it's quite enjoyable. It's fun and with the the ability to play along side friends, in such an early game, it's pretty awesome. Seeing this to become a fully completed game would be really good.

The transition between day and night along with the weather effects develops a sense of extreme phobia (Have I stocked enough wood and flint to maintain my fires throughout the night... do I have enough bandages?). Furthemore the music compliments the gameplay extremely well.\n\n-Crafting system is fleshed out and makes sense.\n\n-Mining system is unique and not voxel based (like mine craft).\n\n-Plays extremely smoothly on my computer on full settings, very beautiful game\n\n\nCONS:\n- Jumping is practically useless\n- I noticed some graphical glitches. For example I bult a stone house and if i walk up to the wall of the house I will clip through and see outside.\n- Killing deer is a ♥♥♥♥♥ without a bow, you end up having to chase the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s all across the map and hit them once....extremely annoying.\n- Building shelters is extremely fun ,but the lack of options to build your base are few....\n- Enemy AI. Although I have not progressed extremely far into the game, I noticed that if you are one on one against a skeleton or a pack of dogs) it is easy to dispatch them by circling around them and hitting.\n\nSUGGESTIONS:\n- A rudimentary map system... that reveals itself as you explore. This can be established via a logbook that your character draws in or some form...otherwise it is extremely easy to get lost and lose where your base is at. If this is not the way to do it, at least allow for the placement of markers on the ground so you can find your way back.\n\n- No walls or fortifications for your base . . . If my team and I decide to permanently make a location our base of operations, it just makes sense to have wooden or stone walls developed (with guard towers if possible) so that we have a safe place to defend.... This would make the game that much more immersive\n\n-Traps! If no foritifactions let us at least develop traps to lure enemies into (such as the infamous pungie pits)... this would bring a level of strategy to the game that is otherwise missing....\n\n-You mentioned on the most recent stream the plan to incorporate a system of blocking with a shield... it would be nice to also use your shield to bash and stun an enemy....\n\n- It would be nice to have caverns and caves in the game (if not already incorporated). A relatively small recessed cave could be used as a great base. Also exploring dank, dark caves would just add to the immersion of the game.\n\n- There is a neat system for hunger and cold in the game, but no system for water.  As anyone who is halfway intelligent knows, a person can last a while without food (even if they are starving) but without water, you are as good as dead... so incorporating a thirst system would be awesome!\n\n- The current building system is neat, but how about expanding it? For example, the current Stone House building, once finished, has a torch on the inside that you can light (when adding the materials to it)... The system is already there so how about we expand on the house we already built. Make it larger, add a second floor, add a well for drawing water (see aformentioned request for a water system).\n\n","August 6, 2015","true","16.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

Or is it the open world Dark Souls where you craft your own gear? Perhaps you are looking for a game like The Forest with functioning multiplayer for up to 7 friends?\nWhatever it is, its cold. Its cold all the time.\n\nVery very good so far at this time of early access - everything works. You can play alone but its a fun co-op adventure and super easy to get started. You can make a server right from the start menu, make it PVP or PVE, and make it public or private.\n\nThe first map is an open world island and if you wander too far too soon, you will be crushed. The beta map by comparison is more attractive but more structured. I dont feel the same fear of leaving the beach, but its going to make a great single player or coop adventure. Theres now one spawn so I dont know how that will work for multiplayer pvp, maybe they will keep both maps? Overall the new map design is smart because it will draw more players than just the hardcore survival crowd.\n\nThe super active devs are constantly changing and adding things so who who knows where it goes?\nIt is an adventure itself watching the game evolve.

Almost to the point in the dev cycle of being worth the asking price as content is added and bugs are squashed on a weekly basis. The crafting system is really starting to get fleshed out and game progression is gear/ location centric. No levels in this game. You live by  fighting through to the next best metal ore nodes, to make the next set of armor/weapons. Food and heat are very important as you can and will starve/freeze to death if you dont watch the feedback meter.\n\nNeeds balancing so combat isn't so extreme from on level of gear to the next  as you get one shoted in tin gear by the plague wovles when moving from the first to second islands, but overall good balance between risk/reward during fights. The one game breaker for me is the fact that you can escape any threat by just jumping up onto a rock. The AI pathing will have them running around said rock allowing you to stand in place and bow kite till dead.","April 7","true","218.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Get past that and you'll find something VERY satisfying. I'm giving this a positive review so I'll start with the cons. Let me start off by saying I was playing PVE and opened my server to multiplayer for anyone to join.\n\nCons:\n* Overall SERIOUS lack of polish. (but I played it when it first launched in EA... Now, a few months later I don't even recognize the game it's so much better.)\n* Clunky controls (however, WASD is present. Keys arent clunky, the feel is.)\n* No Female avatar (thus my wife doesn't want to play)\n\nPros\n* Survival FEELS like surviving.\n* This is the ONLY Survival game where I felt "Home" meant something. Where I was HAPPY to sit by MY fire.\n* Gathering is pretty satisfying.\n* Items don't de-spawn if dropped on ground (in other games I wouldn't care, but in early game, space is SERIOUSLY limited.\n* Monsters can be REALLY dangerous. (Something lacking in most survival PVE)\n\nThis brings me to my last Pro, which deserves a catatgory of its own.\n\nTwo time's I've played. Months ago and now. BOTH times I met AWESOME person after AWESOME person. Everyone I met was SO generous. They would pop in, toss down a bunch of stuff, warm themself by my fire for a while, chatting... and then leave.\n\nIf the community manages to stay this pleasant this game MAY become the "PVEer's Survival game".\n\n10/10 Would chat by the fire again.\n","May 1","true","10.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I think it's one of the best survival games out there, it has a great atmosphere, good graphics, and it's not over-compliated either. The framerate is bad but i'm sure they will fix it at some point.\n\nNow, what i really hate about this is that they added ores, which can be found around the world.  That being said, i pretty much searched the whole second island and i couldn't even make a full set of armor from the ores i found. I think there should be way more ores, it ruins the game. without the equipment you will die on every monster you envounter on island 2, which makes it even harder to find those ores. And this makes multiplayer pointless, there's not enough ore for 1 players, how could it be enough for 8?

Its hard at first, but you can learn how to survive pretty quickly. You can learn even more if you pay online, the community is fairly free of trolls and most everyone wants to help out. After a while i started to figure things out and started to have a much more enjoyable time. Doing things online is fun but you have to be thinking of your party's survival and can be pretty hard. Solo your on your own and have no help, but it can be easier to survive in certain situations. It also has plenty of bosses to make the game interesting and gives it more of an adventure vibe rather than survival at times and when you beat the bosses, it just feels great. Its not even dont yet and even though i got it on sale for about $15, i would have gladly paid the full $20.

Ive heard of the new island that came out all though know nothing about it, it took me an hour to trek all the way across the island and on the way the farther you go the harder guys you face, i found a skeleton boss tree midgets that take 50 arrows to kill and mother ♥♥♥♥ing plague wolves.\nWhile there arnt many weapons or gear to make and sue in the game there are those few items that are near impossible to get and while I have a rather low play time on this game as on the writing of this review I can see this.\nThis games combat is very challenging. At the start its basicly you use the starter item and 2 shot all the enemys then you walk past the dragons tower and find the crazy strong guys like plague wolves where you fight 3 at a time and they do like 13 dmg per hit while you take 10 or more to kill them.\nThis game is addicting and I think extremely scary. the first time I saw a boss besides the dragon it was this op looking skeleton with full armor and a big sword then out of nowhere a plague wolf hits me in the back(they say GYAAA or some ♥♥♥♥ when you attack you the first time) and I about ♥♥♥♥ my pants.\nIf you dont have any urgent need of money and you have 15$ laying around get this game, it gets boring after the about 4 hour mark then you go past the dragon area and start trying to get good items and the game gets way harder and reels you in.\nThe multiplayer is like dont starve where you just make a lobby and people can join ive never had any connection errors even playing with my brother in the same house which you usualy need a bunch of dumb ♥♥♥♥ to be able to do.\nNo long load times, max like 1 minute\nCons:\nThere is a lack of items or variety of guys but with the hardness of getting the end game items it is still fun and takes a long time.\nTheres no way in hell you can beat the bosses alone, id say ths isnt a con but im just going to say this, no you cant beat that dragon alone dont even try.\nthe movement isnt the smoothest, when you look to the sides or up and down its not amazingly smooth but i got used to it in half an hour. This is by far a good game to buy and its early access so they will keep updating it and making it better.\n\n\n","February 21","true","10.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","5","8","2","0"

It doesn't walk you through a tutorial so checking out forum discussions to understand things is important at this time.  If you find a monster, odds are that the first few times you see it, it's gonna mess you up good!  The progression of buildings and weapons/armor feels rather natural, even this early on.  You will quickly learn the importance of shelter, especially at night.  Even with a limited amount of progression that you can make at this point in time of the game, it is very good at consuming your time.\n\nIf you like open-world sandbox survival games with serious enemies, pick it up and watch it develop!","April 17, 2015","true","6.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I want to give some constructive critisism. It seems like all open world survival games have the same thing in common: THEY'RE REALLY GLITCHY/CHEESY (in the graphics of course.) I think they should take the time and make the player move and jump and interact in a more realistic way. I love the building and all that. I think they should also have a tutorial or something. I had to look up where to find things. I just think this game is pretty fun. It could be made into something really amazing!!!

Spawned on the beach, gathered what little was on the ground that I could, and headed towards the player names on my screen that seemed so vastly far away. A few times I found myself waiting my own demise out in order to start over on that beach and go back to my body and gather my stuff again. Took me 3-4 times dying to get the hang of the game, some people find that to be a con I find it to be very fun.\nRan too far and didn't grab enough flint so you can't start a fire? Die from freezing. Didn't gather or hunt any food? Die from starvation. Running around naked at night? Die from wounds bleeding out after surviving wolf attack. Thought you were safe in that little villiage you found? Die from incineration from dragon.\n\nNow I'm addicted and can't get enough. I think what I like most is figuring things out on my own and trying to delve deeper into the game and its story/world.\nCrafting/building, surviving, and playing with others excels in this game as well as hunting and gathering. It's all there and very fun - it has the feel of an MMO except instead of leveling your character, you're just on a never-ending quest to constantly improve him/gather all the crafting materials/explore and of course, surviving the hostile world.\n\nThis game also gives you an option to join friendly servers or hostile, which is neat because on friendly servers you can see player names at all times so you can venture out and join them - however, on hostile servers you cannot see their names.\n\nI like that this game has a sense of mystery and curiosity to the world and its denizens - I must see and do everything for myself!!! Considering this is early access, it is very important that the devs of Savage Lands are very transparent and active; they are always doing live video streams explaining the latest (and frequent) updates/changes to the game. There are no game breaking bugs, and it's only getting better at this point with more content being added.\nThere are also tons of what I call 'little things' that really make this game unique and entertaining (and a bit polished considering early access) - a few examples are the graphics effects, various game mechanics, ambient and environmental sound effects that really bring things to life. Sorry that's not really specific, but just play the game and you'll see for yourself.\n\nCons?\n-Minor bugs but nothing game breaking, can be comical at times (flying animals, rare)\n-Could have more content, not really a fair con since updates/content being added very frequently and the game has so much potential as more things build upon each other\n-Lack of character customization - this is being added in the future though, so just a temporary con\n-In-game voice chat is garbled and unclear - this will probly be solved when they add dedicated server capability (hopefully)\n-Can get real laggy since there are currently non-dedicated hosted servers, but usually okay/join someone else\n-There's warmth, health, and hunger, but no sleep! Maybe there could be a fatigue/sleep status added!\n-Island world: At some point I can see this being sort of a problem. What I mean is that the end-game goal seems to be to kill the dragon (which of course involves gathering the rarest of materials and crafting the rarest of items), but when this is acheived and at this point there are dedicated servers - what happens then? Every tree chopped, landscape overrun with player-made buildings etc., the server is depleted and you go join a new one. Then rinse and repeat...\n\nThanks Signal Studios for a great game.","July 24, 2015","true","54.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

First crafting survival game I have played... bout 7 hours of play time..\n\npros: New game- And very dirfrent, initially, there is a little hand holding that gives you a vey simple and safe opportunity to craft:  a fire place and a lean two;; you find an axe, chop down a couple of trees, collect some stone,, and then kill two  deer,, then you are pretty much on your own... I have not seen a map,\n\nEnvironment: looks good, appears to be very Nordic,,, I have not played skyrim,, but looks similar, a little.. Picture an icelandic coast with snow squalls, wind and distant mountains,,,, appears to be wide open, not at all linear,, Haven't progressed much because i keep on dying,,, skelteons, not a problem it the wolves and other carnivores...speaking of dying, as of yet, the game does not support   a save mechanism.. you die, you respawn back on the coast: Naked, the respawn provides a bright red skull you are able to follow back to your corpes.... Problem, by the time you make it back to your body most times you wiill freeze to  death or die in a wolf attack... I have died bout 5 times ..\nGraphics: look good,,, I get some frame stutter,,,have been fooling around with the settings,,, I have an 8 core processor  running at 3.4, 16 gigs of 2400 ram, Asus 370 Strix 4 gigs.. so, don't think its my hardware\nExploration: this game is not a back yard barberque sim... It is SURVIVAL.  You sit you die, you don't chop wood, you die, you don't hunt and gather, you die...you cook all your meat, you hunt your meat,, Cave man meets the stoneage sim.

Things are definitely being worked on and that is one of the most reassuring things in an EA game.\n\nIt is still needing more development, but if you are willing to deal with rapidly-changing gameplay and the usual woes and uncertainties of Early Access and if you like a challenging survival game, I do recommend Savage Lands. Those lands really are quite savage, but they are beautiful too.\n\nEND OF EDIT***\n\nI find Savage Lands to be be strangely frustrating. I play single player and the difficulty is punishing. I'm glad that there is finally a health bar for enemies, but overall I think that I enjoyed the game more a year ago than I do now.\n\nThe new map is attractive and the graphics are good, but starting out is now even harder. I played for a few hours today and my little dude, Amy*, needs to eat about 5 pigs a day, just to not starve to death. Amy apparently has an amazing metabolism, perhaps it's the cold climate.\n\nChopping down a tree with low level tools now takes 4 times as long as before and pretty much destroys the axe after 1 tree. I'm not sure if it's been fixed yet, but the last time I tried building a house (which took ages what with the slow chopping and the rapidly disintegrating axes) I couldn't actually get inside it, because the doorway was too small. So now I am spending an excruciatingly long time building a stone house. Apparently, they are easier to enter. I sure hope so.\n\nI frequently get a bug that makes it so that the crafting recipe for an item only appears if I don't have the materials in my inventory, making crafting things a right pain in the posterior. Relogging does fix it temporarily, but it's really frustrating.\n\nGetting cold reduces the health bar, but warming back up doesn't allow the lost health to regenerate. So I try to only eat when near a fire so that I can restore the lost health and frankly, it's just another annoyance. As soon as you walk away from your fire you are becoming injured by cold.\n\nThere are plenty of updates and the game is still in active development, unfortunately the development feels somewhat chaotic and it's very difficult to find up-to-date info on anything.\n\nI would love to explore further and see more of the world and possibly it would be a whole lot more fun with a group of friends, but the way that I am feeling right now is that I cannot recommend it in its current state. Hopefully, one day things will feel more balanced and less buggy, but I suspect that the developers are focused more on creating the game that they want to play, rather than the game that I want to play, which is of course their prerogative, but I cannot recommend a game that I'm not really enjoying playing.\n\n*My little dude is called Amy, in honour of the fact that I cannot play as a female character.","May 11","true","31.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","30"

Both these games have the same objective. In both games Forest and The Long Dark, you have to eat and there are enemies that you have to watch out for.There is a feature that all these games have, you cannot get cold enough to die. There is also one thing I like about Savage Lands better than The Forest. Enemies don't bombard you the first day. I have Castleminer Z which is made by the same devs as Savage Lands. Also in Castleminer enemies don't bombard you the first day. In The Forest, I had trouble building and surviving the first day because of the cannibals  bombarding me the first day. Off to Skyrim. Savage Lands and Skyrim are similar because you can build stuff at a Forge just like Skyrim and many more. One thing that none of these games have in common is that you can get diseases and some dude in the (I know you can get diseases in skyrim, Im not talking about those kind of diseases.)\nPros\nHas good amount of content already put into the game\nNot alot of bugs\nGood graphics for an indie game\nA good Sim for Survival\nCons\nFighting Mechanics need work\nWorth every penny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nLook, if you don't think some of the info. is relevant please comment this review.

As other reviewers have mentioned, this is an early access game so garden variety bugs and glitches do occur  (none of them gamebreaking).\n\nPROS:\n-Items don't despawn, so you can drop an item and it will stay there (seemingly) forever\n-Night/Day Cycle: allows for longer days than nights, so you can get more mining and hunting done in the daylight hours when it's safer\n-Map: quite large, albeit somewhat difficult to navigate at first (the compass helps a lot)\n-Crafting: lots of crafting options for several seperate sets of armor, several weapons, and a few buildings\n-Weather: snowstorms really add to the survival aspect of the game because you can die of exposure very quickly if not well equipped, especially when compounded with being in the world at night\n\nCONS:\n-Tbh, there really aren't many other than the run of the mill EA bugs\n\nWhat I'd Like to See:\n-In game map (again, the compass helps, but the community-made map has helped me out quite a bit)\n-More enemies, creatures, weapons, armor, buildings, crafting options, etc.\n\nBeacause the game is EA, I surmise we will be seeing the majority of these gaming aspects in the (hopefully) near future.\nI'm very much enjoying this game and I can't wait to see where the game goes from here!!!\n\n\n\nAlso to the Devs: Thank you so much for making such a fun game for both pc and mac, for they are few and far between on mac.","July 18, 2015","true","79.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

It is challenging, and makes you think about what you need to do to stay alive and not be killed by hunger, the cold, or hostile creatures.   There are a few minor glitches (e.g., sometimes deer running away from you go into a ravine and disappear), but the controls are fairly easy to understand and learn.   Staying alive and improving your situation is a bit of a grind in the early stages, but that grind reflects the premise of the player being exiled on a hostile island with little equipment and left to fend for survival.\n\nI hope the developers keep up their good work.  I recommend Savage Lands for anyone interested in survival-type games (and who is willing to try an Early Access game).\n\nUpdate to my review: It's been a bit more than 2 weeks since my original review.  The more I play Savage Lands, the more I like it ---- even when I occasionally make a mistake and suffer the consequences.  Now, I rate it as one of the top 3 of all the Early Access games I've played.  Thanks to the devs.  I am looking forward to their future efforts at making Savage Lands even better.","July 23, 2015","true","72.1"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","1"

I was excited to play.  Was.  I'll give it another try at next update.  I can't find any purpose in clicking respawn right now.  I know it it's early access but I can not reccomend this game.  Maybe worth 5 dollars right now on the off chance you might enjoy it for the weekend.  Will gladly update this review when the game is recommendable.  And I will be checking.  Biggest issue right now is you will feel like you have zero control in your destiney.  If things around you happen to go right you will live for while and maybe build a house or something.  But 90% of the time you will be attacked by a wolf or just freeze to death before you have any sort of opportunity to do whatever it is your supposed to do while your surviving.  Very shallow experience so far.  I would make reccomendations but I think it would be insulting to the company to assume they think this is an even close to good enough product right now.

This game has unlimited potential. My first spawn in after reading guides, watching tuorials etc.. Was pretty straight forward. I met up with some guys in a town and had a blast, we were constructing a settlement of our own. Were all warm, had reasonable supplies and were really going in the right direction. And in that hour or so I had the most fun in any survival game I've personally had to be honest, and this game really relies on teamwork and trust.\n\nThe only bad thing I have seen as of now is when we join a server, a lot of times the Host will leave and if you're working with people you just met and are doing well. It's unfortunate for the server to shut down because the Host left. I really wish we could see the possibility of the game switching to a different host.","August 5, 2015","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Another thing i would like to mention is that the setting feels like a real place, i often find that in games there are often places that seem completely impossible and they're usually all over the place, this game makes the world feel very possible, roaming enemies may also attribute to this feeling of realism.\n\nGraphically it's good considering it's in-progress state but nothing to write home about.\n\nAudio wise i actually quite like it, i usually listen to podcasts while i game so i shut off the music but the ambient audio is really nice, it's fairly good quality, and simple enough to be both pleasent and immersive.\n\nGameplay (control) is good, controls well and the options available make things nice, it may be a personal thing but being able to set any command to any key is incredibly nice and almost a shock to see in a game of this level of development, i feel a lot of people won't even notice this but i feel it deserves a mention.","August 5, 2015","true","22.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It is literally the perfect center of DayZ and Skyrim. Super fun single player and I've been wanting more. Haven't gotten into a legitament hostile public server yet with my friends, but I'm still kind of learning how to play the game to the best of my ability. Building your civilization and then deciding to make the trek somewhere else is such a pressuring feeling, and it keeps the feeling in the game. The biggest complaint that I have about the game is that it is almost literally impossible to get back to your civilization if you die at night. The dire wolves that you meet in the night are crazy ramped up and it seems that more appear at night than in the day time, making it impossible to recover your corpse without getting picked off by one of these ♥♥♥♥ers. Not saying that this is all just annoying and bad, it actually makes for a lot of suspense and caution not to get picked off recovering your corpse. It definitely sets the mood. If it was easier to get back to your corpse at night, I would definitely give this game an 8.5/10. Since there are updates almost weekly, I could see this happening sooner rather than later. But, as of this current patch, I would give Savage Lands a strong 7.8/10. I've been loving it and I highly recommend playing this game in the dark or by candlelight. Sets the ambience to the max :)","August 8, 2015","true","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I understood that it was early access, and that release fetures would not be present.  That being said, I really enjoy the game and look forward to what new material will be added.\n\nI consider myself a completionist kinda guy.  I like to have the best armor, weapons, and materials to craft the biggest and best item in the game.  The diversity in the game isn't there...yet, but I can imagine an epic crafting tree with tiers of gear to explore the Savage Lands with.  The combat is pretty straight forward with a few enemies having the weakness of not turning fast.  You can cheese it for slow, lumbering mobs, but the fast moving wolves don't play by those rules...and I like it.\n\nNow for the slight downside that I have for the game.  I spent about 3-4 hours one afternoon and mined, chopped, collected everything that my world could offer.  I found that after that was done, there wasn't anything else left for me.  So what did I do? I created another world and went back at it.  I personally feel that characters should be tied to a world, and not allowed to be used on different worlds.  My second drawback is the size of the map in relation to content to explore.  I've found 5 villiages, and a few "ruins" but nothing in those towns made me want to stay and explore the surrounding areas.  I would just check a few houses, and move on down the path.  Give me something that has some lore to it so I fully understand about the land.  The lack of reference of distance also hurts the exploring of the game.  I have seen the island from coast to coast to coast and I have no fathomable idea on how large that actual island is.  I know if take between 15-25 minutes to travel in a straight line from one side to the other.\n\nAll in all, the game is great.  Small tweaks over the next few months should be extremely pleasing for this game.  I can't wait for what this game truely has to offer.","August 11, 2015","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Highly recommended. For all those who blame the lack of content,... it's an alpha game. There will be much more content in the future for sure! I've played 10 hours yet and there is still plenty plenty more to explore and to craft. Very few bugs for an alpha! I hope there will be some kind of story in the game in further development, e.g. some books you can find where some history or story about the island is written.\nGreat game!!!","August 11, 2015","true","17.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Cold, Hunger and Health play a part as they would realisticly so gamers can really have an experience where they have to keep themselves alive. As one gets deeper in the island there are more enemies especially at night so its quite easy to find yourselves with no food, no fire and no shelter, or get lost and can't find your base! you can use the ruins of bases on the island or make your own buildings yourself. I quite liked that you can place logs into a building and it will gradually form shape.

Single player is quite boring tbh, but I've hosted a few games with some of my friends and then it turns into a blast. :) We've currently established a line of bases up and down the beach so we can explore different areas and have a safe haven to return to. We've also established 2 "hunting lodges" inland for extensive deer hunting. We've ran into all sorts of trouble from being set upon by a pack of wolves, to upsetting Kur and having him chase us all the way to our hunting lodge, where he flamed repeatedly the building we were cowering in. All in all I've really enjoyed the game and the weapons do need some degree of skill to use (especially the bow which I couldn't use at all starting off lol). If you're one of those players who will gallop to the best gear you can get in as short a time as possible, you will find there's not a lot that will challenge you at the moment (except a giant and Kur lol), it is early access after all, but if you're the type of player that likes developing the island, explore, and have a laugh with your mates then its definately worth picking up.\n\nFor the devs: Love the game, can't wait to see what new monsters pop up on the island. Would love to see things like "goblin" villages or something (don't have to be goblins but you get the idea) with "goblin" hunting parties hunting deer and stuff as well so you have competition for resources. Would also like to see resources regenerate slowly (like trees grow, stone replenish etc).

A little tutorial at the beginning to show you how to play and what key does what ect would be nice, though it is fairly intuitive and I picked it up quickly by playing around with the buttons and keys.\nA couple other things I think it needs:\nSome sort of map system, even if its a very rudimentry or crudely drawn one of discovered areas.\nAbility to sleep. You still won't be able to skip or fast forward through night, but you get some other bonuses like douple Heath regen and halved hunger decay, maybe only as long as you stay above 60% body heat. Also it would give you a third person camera with free rotation mobility so you could look around and keep an eye out for enemies. activated my typing /sleep in the chat.\nOn the topic, include several emotes you can type into chat to perform, such as: /sit, /laugh, /dance, /taunt\n\ni've only played about a week ingame so I don't know if it is already in the game or in development, but changing seasons and weather. Some days it might rain, some more than others, and more often in spring/early summer, getting wet increases heat decay in cold temperatures. Possibly even expand the heat bar to go over 100, if you get too hot you start losing health?\n\nAlso, the deer need more meat. The game is suppost to be pretty realistic and in real life if you kill a deer you have enough food for at least a week or two. 4 or 5 meat per deer seems fair.\nLastly, having water sources on the island and the ability to fish from lakes, ponds, rivers, streams and the ocean would be nice. Spear fishing anyone?\n\n\ntl;dr: Great game 9/10. Has a few things that could be improved or added, such as maps, sleep and other emotes, seasons and weather, more meat from deer, inland water sources and the ability to fish. but it is open beta so there is plenty of time and chances to impliment more changes and developments.

Rather than expending much time building bases or collecting resources, Savage Lands emphasizes on traveling and foraging, taking the occasional stop at a deserted town to resupply. Much of your time will be spent either ambushing monsters or being ambushed yourself, slowly building up to the greatest weapons and armor to take on the strongest foes.","November 4, 2015","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not played solo, however it's a GREAT game while playing with friends. Started off building our little village. Was great working together, one on deforesting the area, one mining and one hunting. Got ourselves built up fairly well, running around to keep each other alive as we had to push further to mine. Once we reached a point where our equipment was fairly strong we began exploring. Spent a day preparing, repearing our equpiment, hunting for food and farming the essentials to keep ourselves alive. Started travelling through the day and setting up camp during the nights. Was real fun having to plan for each day, fighting to keep each other alive and travelling the island.\n\nWatched a few dev streams and happy to see there's still a lot of ideas and work being put in to the game. Loving the game now and excited to see what happens in the future.\n\nEdit: Watching dev stream now. My first decision on this game was to run out in to the forest naked... the dragon got me.

The Kur dragon encounter theme is especially amazing.\n\n8.5/10, not yet complete, but it will get a solid 10 when they complete it, I'm sure of it!\n\n\nHave you ever played a game that feels so refreshing and new to you? This is that feeling. Even if you haven't, this will be that first feeling.\n\nEDIT:The developers have added more content, and now it feels even more refreshing and a bit more fair.\n\nSECOND EDIT: Developers are getting really smart and listening to the fanbase.\n\nThis is like a mixture of Minecraft and Skyrim. The beauty of skyrim and the exploration of both games. The crafting system is unique like that of Minecraft.\n\n\nAlthough there are so many positives to this game, and you should absolutely get it, I write this review extremely infuriated. Although there are so many pros, there are cons.\n\nPros +:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/ksobenes/screenshot/421440386972373147\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/ksobenes/screenshot/421440386972372652 OH  MY GOD THE MONOLITH!!!\n\n+Well made island that is super massive, you will definately get lost without a compass.\n\n+The game keeps you entertained throughout with its breathtaking visuals and stunning gameplay. It is truly a survival game to test your endurance, skill, and most of all-- patience.\n\n+The combat can be pretty smooth if your mouse and reflexes are good.\n\n+The Developers actually fix the issues instead of shoving their thumbs firmly up their ♥♥♥♥' and saying "Nah, screw you we'll do what we want when we want!!!". I feel a bunch of passion in this game, and they fix the issues. I removed a few cons just to show how much they listen to the player base.\n\n+Kur the Dragon fight added. Practically the new "Forest Giant" since the Forest Giant finally got nerfed to be soloable.\n\n+New weapons released that look very inspiring. I can tell there is going to be some casting of various things in the future if we have a sword that has a magical glow.\n\n+So many that I gave up listing them. Just buy it and see for yourself!\n\n\nCons:\n\n-A.I. seems broken at times. As I write this I'm stuck naked on top of a rock while a Dire Bear and Skeleton run around it. They are also really persistant and annoying, to the point where you need to kill them for them to stop chasing them. They are a bit over powered from when you begin, and way too many wolves appear at once, making it extremely hard to stay alive. Every NPC except the skeletons do way too much damage and have way too much health when you first accidentally encounter them, at least have a loud noise of a bear/plague wolf that you can hear as soon as you get close to the area. And you have to run into them regularly in order to get to the resources you need. They end up killing you and you can't move your respawn point unless you build another one, which is impossible if you can't kill skeletons and chop wood, which is impossible because you don't have any tools upon respawning and lose everything. You have to start an entirely new character if you die while you're lost or die a few times to lead the npc's away so you can retrieve your stuff then kill every last one of them. The A.I. keeps you staying on a rock for five minutes while you freeze to death and never stop chasing you unless you are on a rock for five freaking minutes, which in turn drains your heat meter, which in turn, lowers your health.\n\n-There needs to be a map for the entire island that draws itself out as you explore so you can get back to where you were/where you want to explore so you don't get so lost.New strategy to counteract this is a Compass, a death marker, and chopping down millions of trees to make weapon racks as a "bread crumb" trail.\n\n-Needs less limits on what you can and cannot craft without a blacksmith. You can practically only craft one in an area or else you will most likely die trying to build another one and cannot find it. There needs to be some kind of portable smithy or something. They added a rare "smithy" attached to a burned down home in old villages.\n\n-Plauge wolves spawn in the beginning parts of the island where you spawn if you go a little far at night and have eyes behind their tiny testicular organs so they can see behind them a mile away. Nearly impossible to kill with a starter hammer, and they spawn as you begin.\n\n-No bear should take 15-25 arrows to kill, even if it's a dire bear, and treat your armor like it's just wet paper.They fixed up the bears, good trade off of Power and Defense with them. Good melee blade will be able to fix them up.\n\n-No wolf pack made up of 10 wolves should do 5 damage to you when you have full armor on you and a Wolfsbane. (That's the reason I rage quit for a bit at one time.)\n\n-No wolf, bear, skeleton or any creature that ever existed would follow you to hell itself and back just to bite you. Especially when they can kill you so easily with full armor on.\n\n-Your armor breaks way too easily, especially the top tier armor, Ebon Steel.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, it's a great game, but it needs fixes in the NPC's and enemies. Especially how persistant they are. I haven't been this mad at a game since Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate and Sm4sh, even though how wonderful this game is. However, despite its difficulties, you cannot help but return to it. It's too much of a treasure to skip out on, especially when it's on sale. Buy it for yourself and your friends too!","August 5, 2015","true","51.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A little tutorial at the beginning to show you how to play and what key does what ect would be nice, though it is fairly intuitive and I picked it up quickly by playing around with the buttons and keys.\nA couple other things I think it needs:\nSome sort of map system, even if its a very rudimentry or crudely drawn one of discovered areas.\nAbility to sleep. You still won't be able to skip or fast forward through night, but you get some other bonuses like douple Heath regen and halved hunger decay, maybe only as long as you stay above 60% body heat. Also it would give you a third person camera with free rotation mobility so you could look around and keep an eye out for enemies. activated my typing /sleep in the chat.\nOn the topic, include several emotes you can type into chat to perform, such as: /sit, /laugh, /dance, /taunt\n\ni've only played about a week ingame so I don't know if it is already in the game or in development, but changing seasons and weather. Some days it might rain, some more than others, and more often in spring/early summer, getting wet increases heat decay in cold temperatures. Possibly even expand the heat bar to go over 100, if you get too hot you start losing health?\n\nAlso, the deer need more meat. The game is suppost to be pretty realistic and in real life if you kill a deer you have enough food for at least a week or two. 4 or 5 meat per deer seems fair.\nLastly, having water sources on the island and the ability to fish from lakes, ponds, rivers, streams and the ocean would be nice. Spear fishing anyone?\n\n\ntl;dr: Great game 9/10. Has a few things that could be improved or added, such as maps, sleep and other emotes, seasons and weather, more meat from deer, inland water sources and the ability to fish. but it is open beta so there is plenty of time and chances to impliment more changes and developments.

Definitely worthy of some early access money love. From what I've played so far, I think this could shape up to be the definitive survival experience beyond "DayZ" and "7 Days to Die". You really do feel that sense of urgency to survive here, constantly looking at your warmth, health and hunger levels.\nHunting is a bit hit and miss right now, and really makes me wish the animals were more skittish. The wolves could be a little bigger and meaner looking.\n\nThe Good:\n- Linux, because, well yeah.\n- Definite sense of survival.\n- Skyrim-like environment.\n- Nice day/night cycle.\n- Nice NPC animations and main character ones too.\n- Easy to use UI.\n- Nice atmosphere and sounds.\n\nThe Bad(ish):\n- No third person view mode (from what I could see).\n- Hunting is a bit easy. Just stand behind a deer and slap it with your hatchet.\n- UI could use some polish.\n- Could do with a female character too. So I can get the Mrs in with me.\n\nAdditional,\n\nEven More Good:\n- Developer actually reads gamer feedback and responds. *thumbs up","August 5, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You're thrown in, and have to figure everything out merely by your wits and intuition. Once you've gotten a feel for the game though, it's rather easy to manage yourself. Though, with cold nights and hostile monsters lurking nearby it's always challenging.\n\nOne thing I don't like about the game in it's current state is not being able to break down lower teir items for their resources.

This game has unlimited potential. My first spawn in after reading guides, watching tuorials etc.. Was pretty straight forward. I met up with some guys in a town and had a blast, we were constructing a settlement of our own. Were all warm, had reasonable supplies and were really going in the right direction. And in that hour or so I had the most fun in any survival game I've personally had to be honest, and this game really relies on teamwork and trust.\n\nThe only bad thing I have seen as of now is when we join a server, a lot of times the Host will leave and if you're working with people you just met and are doing well. It's unfortunate for the server to shut down because the Host left.

It is literally the perfect center of DayZ and Skyrim. Super fun single player and I've been wanting more. Haven't gotten into a legitament hostile public server yet with my friends, but I'm still kind of learning how to play the game to the best of my ability. Building your civilization and then deciding to make the trek somewhere else is such a pressuring feeling, and it keeps the feeling in the game. The biggest complaint that I have about the game is that it is almost literally impossible to get back to your civilization if you die at night. The dire wolves that you meet in the night are crazy ramped up and it seems that more appear at night than in the day time, making it impossible to recover your corpse without getting picked off by one of these ♥♥♥♥ers. Not saying that this is all just annoying and bad, it actually makes for a lot of suspense and caution not to get picked off recovering your corpse. It definitely sets the mood. If it was easier to get back to your corpse at night, I would definitely give this game an 8.5/10. Since there are updates almost weekly, I could see this happening sooner rather than later. But, as of this current patch, I would give Savage Lands a strong 7.8/10. I've been loving it and I highly recommend playing this game in the dark or by candlelight.

Hope there is more content, like maybe little goblins, and please increase the spawn of monsters, and add more better bows, i hate the 2 shot long bow to hunt. Overall, the more effort they put into the game, really pays alot. This game IS and WILL BE worth $20.","August 8, 2015","true","16.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Another thing i would like to mention is that the setting feels like a real place, i often find that in games there are often places that seem completely impossible and they're usually all over the place, this game makes the world feel very possible, roaming enemies may also attribute to this feeling of realism.\n\nGraphically it's good considering it's in-progress state but nothing to write home about.\n\nAudio wise i actually quite like it, i usually listen to podcasts while i game so i shut off the music but the ambient audio is really nice, it's fairly good quality, and simple enough to be both pleasent and immersive.\n\nGameplay (control) is good, controls well and the options available make things nice, it may be a personal thing but being able to set any command to any key is incredibly nice and almost a shock to see in a game of this level of development, i feel a lot of people won't even notice this but i feel it deserves a mention.","August 5, 2015","true","22.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

This game has unlimited potential. My first spawn in after reading guides, watching tuorials etc.. Was pretty straight forward. I met up with some guys in a town and had a blast, we were constructing a settlement of our own. Were all warm, had reasonable supplies and were really going in the right direction. And in that hour or so I had the most fun in any survival game I've personally had to be honest, and this game really relies on teamwork and trust.\n\nThe only bad thing I have seen as of now is when we join a server, a lot of times the Host will leave and if you're working with people you just met and are doing well. It's unfortunate for the server to shut down because the Host left. I really wish we could see the possibility of the game switching to a different host.","August 5, 2015","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

We have some ideas of things we would love to see in upcoming updates. First off walking is a long and tiring proccess in Savage lands, in-game we have a main base camp with a town hall, forge, etc; but when we go hunting for food or going for minerals it is a lengthy proccess and it would be great if you could add mounts. In the way of mounts I was thinking that of course there should be horses, but why not have something more exciting? I don't know about you but I would personaly love to charge into battle atop my burly war bear to take out my enimies, or soar through the skies atop my dragon stead. I'm sure that you have heard this from lots of your players, but the map NEEDS to be larger. There is simply not enough to explore! I understand this game is relatively new, so for where it is this game is doing great. I reccomend this game to anyone willing to grind for materials for little reward other than to have them, and to survive in game. While I cannot say this game is a must-buy it should not be overlooked. So Devs I hope you have not overlooked this review and will take my ideas into consideration, and than you for providing hours of social fun with my friends.","June 17, 2015","true","7.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

I found traces of living people there. Huts, gathered food and even some much needed tools. But I saw nobody. I took their things hoping they could one day forgive a man doing what he needs to survive.\n\nAlong the shore there were a couple campfires, but I lacked the resources to light them up. Or maybe I did, but didn't want to use them just for the sake of seeing fire. At least not yet. The cold winds never cease their attacks on me.\n\nLeaving the sand behind, I adventured to the wilderness. Abundant pine trees waved welcomes to me and I welcomed some deers - I mean, running food AND resources. I've never imagined I would kill a living creature with my own hands, but it happened and I am alive now because of that.\n\nLater I found a village. Finally! I was excited to see signs of real civilization closing in on the horizon as I dashed with all of what was left of my strength.\nNot a single living creature. And that meant two things:\n1- The people who lived here either left or died.\n2- Some of those who stayed behind (and died) are not very found of foreigners.\n\nSo I had to face skeletons armed with just a stone axe. Luckly, they were in a shape far worse than mine.\n\nThe sun left my world, the cold snow masked everything in a beautiful and deadly white and my mind wondered what would happen to me if I were to perish here. Would I become one of them?\n\nI didn't feel good. I could say I felt the heat leaving my body, but there weren't even traces of it in me. I've heard of peopple who froze to death. What happened to them. The blurry sight, weakness, shaking. The air was ice and it burnt my lungs with every breath. I couldn't go much further. But even before my fall, I witnessed a gigantic winged craeture soaring the skies.\n\nI died then. It was my first day. But somehow I was there again. The familiar beach. I don't understand this. Is it hell? Am I condemned to freeze to death every day? I hope not. I don't think so. What the devils don't know is that I am getting better, adapting, learning to survive and I will have my revenge.\n__________________________________________\n\nThink of this game as hardcore minecraft. You struggle to survive and have to juggle your health, hunger, cold, explorations, building, crafting and resource hunting. Good luck!\nOh, and get a friend to play it with you.","June 30, 2015","true","18.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

Its fun and challenging which adds to the over satisfaction its not just stupidly difficult gameplay on top of impossible  odds. The devs from what i hear are very very interested in user feedback and keep diologue rolling with many gamers which is exactly how it should be. I love the crafting and building system, it gives you the feeling the island is yours for the taking and truly it is. The only downside is as you start reaching out for minerals and expanding you get the feeling the island is very small. However even though the island is small by my standards it is packed with action you cant walk for 30 seconds without seeing some form of life. Nightfall is another fun addition i wish it was darker making the torch an absolute necessity but we'll see where they go with it. Some users say its too difficult i find that to be untrue. Just remember survivors, preparation is everything. dont go out fighting forest giants in your skivvies with a rock tied to a stick.","June 30, 2015","true","22.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have played it with 2 friends i got interested in it. I even gifted it to one of my friends i like it so much. There are some things that could be added though... Now i know the game is in Early Access so it makes sense that some things in other games are not in this. But, with that being said here are some things my friends and I put together for the Devs to add. NPC's that you can interact with, the interaction could be just trading your 10 wood logs for a Hat or something more in depth like doing mission for the NPCs of the village and getting rewards that way. Some other things could be Mounts or pets. This would be nice because where we live there is not much rock or mobs. Or my idea of pets. We could tame a wolf with some deer meat or something else and they would follow us around and protect us. You could also add backpacks or sachels for your pets to wear on  their back so you could carry more stuff.\n\nDefinetely worth it, and they are working hard on updates in the future so thats awesome","June 17, 2015","true","15.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

We have some ideas of things we would love to see in upcoming updates. First off walking is a long and tiring proccess in Savage lands, in-game we have a main base camp with a town hall, forge, etc; but when we go hunting for food or going for minerals it is a lengthy proccess and it would be great if you could add mounts. In the way of mounts I was thinking that of course there should be horses, but why not have something more exciting? I don't know about you but I would personaly love to charge into battle atop my burly war bear to take out my enimies, or soar through the skies atop my dragon stead. I'm sure that you have heard this from lots of your players, but the map NEEDS to be larger. There is simply not enough to explore! I understand this game is relatively new, so for where it is this game is doing great. I reccomend this game to anyone willing to grind for materials for little reward other than to have them, and to survive in game. While I cannot say this game is a must-buy it should not be overlooked. So Devs I hope you have not overlooked this review and will take my ideas into consideration, and than you for providing hours of social fun with my friends.","June 17, 2015","true","7.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

After around 4 hours though, I had accomplished everything possible. The graphical look of the world is generically pretty though uninspired.

I strolled the beach looking for supplies, I found a stick, a tool, a frost fern and some clothes. I continued to walk the beach were I found an abandoned fire and shelter, sadly the fire was out. I chooped down a few trees and found plenty of stone, however I had difficulty finding any sticks or flint, therefore I coudn'y build a shelter. I spent so long worrying about starting a fire I gave up and decided to worry more about a shelter. I then realized I was out of food, so I went hunting, where I found nothing to eat/hunt.

Not really any sense of direction when you start out. I just ran around for a while, killed a few skeletons and a wolf, then froze to death. All I really found in this time were four of the same hammer, and some meat. The combat system also feels a little boring. I would like to see some major improvments with the crafting menu as well. I was expecting my computer to handle it better too, it was stuttering a bit.\n\nThe game is too early in development for me to really judge it properly. Definitely a lot of potential here.

However, being against EA, I told myself I would wait quite a bit until purchasing.  Now that the game has been out for a bit and seeing tons of great reviews I decided to take the plunge. Very glad that I did.\n\nIt constantly gets compared to Minecraft + Skyrim.  I wouldn't exactly say that is the hybrid I would go with, but I can see it.\n\nIt is not a digging game or a block builder.  So dont get excited if that's what you love about Minecraft/Terraria.\n\nIt isnt an action rpg.  There arent any NPCs. So if that what you like about Skyrim, then tough.\n\nWhat it is: Awesome.\n\nYou are washed up on a beach.  You find a few supplies that must've fallen off of your very tiny boat.\n\nYou have 3 bars that you have to manage.  Cold. HP.  Hunger. All easily managable.\n\nYou start of with barely any inventory space... Logical because you washed up basically nude.\n\nYou have to gather everything you can!  Build a fire to keep warm and cook meat from the various wild life you will have to kill. (Sorry Bambi lovers)  Make a house to stay safe at night (also keeps you warm).  Cutting down trees, and mining are your main resources, but with lots to explore and find washed up on shore or at various camps where others have perished.\n\nThere are several types of enemies that require different tactics and better gear to "progress" while you try to gather materials and better your gear.\n\nAnd there is a giant dragon flying about!\n\nThis game is constantly getting updated.  The devs are constantly keeping the community in the loop and taking suggestions.  It seems like the devs want to keep this as realistic as possible but set within a fantasy world... I very much approve of this decision.  I really hope they dont end up taking advice from all of the casual complainers who want some modern-esque survival game.\n\nIt is totally worth a pick up.  It isnt anywhere near finished but there is tons to do and lots to see.  I definitely think it is the type of game that one would enjoy to see evolve just as much as you would enjoy the game play.\n\nNote: I unfortunately have not given multiplayer a try, so I did not mention that in my review.  All I do know is there are 2 modes, one pvp and one thats pve co-op style.","August 8, 2015","true","9.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

I normally don't like games with the idea to survive and craft so hardcore in the beginning of the game, and normally not a fan of the first-person view either but that view has grown on me through other games played.\n\nI LOVE this game so far, could be that I play it with 1-2 other people though... All I know is that I enjoy the challenge and getting to explore while having to find your way back to your camp, etc. It's easy in the beginning with a camp built near the water, but after moving it more inland you really need to rely on a compass and different landmarks of sorts.\n\nVery interested in what changes will come about in the future, hoping perhaps the ability to craft a "recall potion" of sorts that can bring you back to your set spawn point is a possibility, but if not it's not too terribly hard to navigate yourself.","July 3, 2015","true","19.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Sadly I've yet to see any furies or giants, I'm guessing i just not far enough from the start area yet. Can't wait to fight some of the named enemies, planning to go looking for a few tonight.\n\nThings I'd like to see\nWould be really nice if building a structure would level the terrain floor, would prevent dropped items from rolling outside under the walls and whatnot, not to mention the ground clipping through the floor of the townhalls.\n\nAmmo counter for the bow, yea i know u can put the arrows in the hotbar but after u use those 25 u can't tell how many more u have, not a big thing would just be semi helpful.\n\nQuiver bag, could only hold arrows but would let them stack to 100 intstead of 25 and have a few slots, could be a worn item maybe accessory slot, other accessories could be cloaks to help warm when in armor that isn't so warm. Epic teir item, after kur combat done could include a fireproof cloak made from kurs own hide.\n\nA block mechanic, shields would be nice but if i can block with my sword at least i wouldn't mind so much.\n\nSome type of cave/dungeon in game would be cool but I'm sure thats already been thought of.\n\nAll in all the game is amazing so far and i can see myself playing plenty more in the weeks to come, I love that there is an update countdown in the main menu.

You can decide how far you wish to explore, the further you go from the initial shores you can encounter more dangerous enemies. What I especially like it how you can basicly build every structure available in several hours of game time, though the only really usefull structure is the blacksmith which makes it possible to make better armor and weapons (provided you have the materials).

Calling it what it is or not, the two things really mingle well. I feel this game has potential because of its difficulty, atmosphere, and pvp.\n\nGranted, early access, here are some things that could be improved upon:\nDedicated servers and (Subsequently) raising the servers player cap far beyond 8.\nBeing able to crouch, not just slow walk.\nSmoothing of combat system, its not day z clunky but its still could use polishing.\nOptimization of graphics. I dont exactly have a great gaming computer, but for the quality of these graphics it shouldn't be as difficult to run smoothly as it seems.\nIm sure a lot of people also feel something is missing with no quests, dungeons, or any other true objectives besides survive and attempt to thrive with. However, I dont think it needs it. This could really be an interesting game if rather than copy/pasting the typical survival game mechanics, features, and far too many craftables, instead it took advantage of its multiplayer and gently encouraging players to make the most of an open world, realistic tribal, or even feudal, survival/ pvp warfare system. Something about this game just makes me yearn for that kind of experience.\n\nOverall, not bad.

This game is worth every penny and then some.  I've spent the last 2 years digging through survival games since I outgrew Minecraft.  There are a lot of garbage titles in the genre and that is a good thing as the best games easily rise to the top.  This is one of those gems for sure.  The most amazing thing is that this game isn't even remotely finished and it's already my fav game in the genre by far.  This is intended to become a Skyrim-survivalish game.  So at some point I'm going to be able to cast fireball spells?  Just take my money now.  My only regret is that I bought this game on sale for $8.00, and I really feel bad that the developers are not ♥♥♥♥♥ing the other $12.00 they had planned on.  I've never felt this way about a game and may in fact donate another 12 bucks just so I feel better about it.  Just buy this game... DO NOT watch streams or YouTube videos if you can help it.

The game reminds me of Skyrim and dayz in the same game! There are multiple ways to survive and go through your adventure. I love how the environment seamlessly integrates with the gameplay.  Sometimes I feel like I am actually walking on that island.  Although graphics aren't the goal of this game I will say it can really suck your time away from how engaging it is.  However, optimization in the game isn't at an all time high.  So you can expect large lag spikes here and there.  As well as graphical glitches, such as floating deer or flying trees.  The beta of this game is showing a much larger map of amazing proportions and some dungeons with mysteries surrounding them such as why is there a giant meteor or what was the role of the dragon bridge? The beta inculdes dungeons, new bosses, and a better island.

However my only complaint is regarding the very limited inventory space as well as limited stacking. Even if the meat is the same you can only have 1 raw meat of that type in a slot. To make a fire you need 3 logs but you can only have 2 per stack. Max inventory space is roughly 11 or 13 slots (can't recall at this time).   Other little annoyence is when you kill an animal it doesn't always give you meat. It would make sense to get a poorer quality of meat instead of none at all.    However please do not let these little annoying things stop you from trying the game.  I imagine you would thoroughly enjoy it with friends.

Actually I played it with a few friends on both occasions. To say the least, its fun, basic, and gives a decent enough challenge. In addition, after coming back to it, I'm impressed with the progress the dev's are making. Compared to the first time I played it, SL has made massive improvements. It's still a little wonky, hit boxes can be off, the AI will occasionally get confused and you'll see the rarer graphical glitch. However those are the negatives. I'm sure if you scroll through the comments you'll find the more nitpicking detailed issues that people have. However, for a $15 early access indie multiplayer, Savage Lands stands out. It has a comprehensive UI and crafting system, a time consuming yet entertaining grinding system, the graphics and AI are still well built for what it is.\n\nDoes it have it's problems? Sure, yet like I said it's an early access indie (that's only $15) and for that I give it a 10/10. Also the Devs are still here! (ikr, rare AF)\nIs it worth the money? Absolutely! Especially if you're going to play with friends. You get to set up your own servers, its savable, and it easy AF to set up.\nHow is SL compared to other Indies/Alphas? It's simple, it doesn't compare. I mean that in a good way. This game hit the nail on the head for me. Nowadays you have to sort through all the glitchy PoS waste of money multiplayers, Indies, and or Alphas that Steam has to offer. All so you can find a remotely decent one to play with friends. Even then, most are pay to win or the Dev's give up on them after the first couple of months, and or the Dev/Devs just run off with the money *cough cough Dean Hall*.\n\nIn conclusion, seeing as I'm starting to rant. Overall Savage Lands is still a very solid game and in my opinion it is a load of fun and definitely worth the money.","April 9","true","30.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Yes, there are some bugs, but the game is still worth getting.

Lack of instructions makes getting started tricky. There are some decent walkthrus on YouTube. When just starting out, be sure to make a hammer and an axe. Hammers can mine rocks and axes can harvest trees and shrubs. Both can be used as weapons. Finding flint can be tricky... seek out boulders that highlight red when you look at them up close. Maneuver during combat... staying behind your enemy is key to avoiding damage.

The whole lore is cool to, and the crafting system seems pretty solid, not to hard to craft stuff, but not hours of grinding hard either.\nBasically, it’s visually appealing, not the best graphics ever but the environment is epic. The combat system is okay. As it is a survival game it’s top notch keeping you interested in a deep world. The game seems to be advancing well, with good updates frequently, and a good team running it.

Nothing in this new place seems familiar.\nMaybe - just maybe - I could find shelter from this cold wind.\n\nNothing seems as I remember, this new land is harsh, cold and savaged. Even the wildlife here seems to be savaged. Last time I went in land, I was chased by a fierce wolf, I barely made it out of there alive. Had it not been for my Frost fern bandage, I would surely have succumbed from the bleeding from the wound the wolf left as a gift on my right leg.\nNow all I really want to do is to stay alive, even if it means that I have to find shelter somewhere around the beach.\nAt least then I can always have a lookout on ships sailing by here. Unfortunately, I have yet to spot any ships coming this way.\n\nThe snow storm is still raging outside of my hut, so for now at least - all I can do is sit tight in here. However, I should probably get a plan going, seeing as it seems I will be stuck on this ravaged land for a long time. The cooked wolf meat are soon running out, and I think I spotted a few deer roaming a little further away from the hut. I might go out tomorrow and see if I can at least hunt one of the deer. Now is probably a good time to get some rest so I have a little strength for tomorrows hunting.\n\nLater that night a strange roar is heard\nWhat is that? That certainly did not sound like any sound I heard before. Could it be people using some kind of horn? Nay, I have yet to see anyone around here. Frankly I think I am all alone for now.\nAs I wander outside, looking around - left, right, back and forth. I hear a faint flapping of wings. I brace myself, ready to seek shelter in the hut again. As I turn my head slowly, I notice the shadow on the ground in front of me.\n\nHoly smoke! A Dragon! I could have sworn these were only occurring in the folk tales. Stories told to children to keep the from going out at night. But right now, this shadow is roaming around my hut. Look at the size of that thing, it's almost 13 meters long, with a wing span of at least three tall men.\nI run back into the hut, panting and sweating at the sight of the fierce creature.","March 5, 2015","true","24.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Key was to stay calm and patient, and "think" it out, which is what I really like best about the game. Rather than just keystrokes and repetitive actions, you have to strategize what you're doing to make real progress. I've discovered the five main towns of the island and monolith and had some lethal interactions with the "wild" life  LOL but have improved my hunting skills considerably since first starting the game. My advice, play with a friend, be patient, and give the game a chance...it becomes addictive pretty fast. Still lots of bugs that need tweaking but programmers seem to be going through that list little by little. Some realistic features are in place, while things like needing water to survive and being able to tear down already made wooden structures for kindling and making fires, or just removing them isn't in place yet. But like I said...solid game, looking forward to final edition.","April 17, 2015","true","566.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

They don't force you into PvP like some games, great for me since I hate PvP survival games, but PvP is available. Most players I've met are nice and helpful, and you can easily have stuff to do for 40+ hours, and if you need more, you can make new characters and start over, or just jump into other people's servers and help out.
