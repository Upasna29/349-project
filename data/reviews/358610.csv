The developer hasn't made any updates or trading cards as promised; 1 year later it's safe to say this game is a lost cause. This game is Double Dead.\n\nThis isn't worth $7 or even $0.99. It should be free or not played.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

I wasnt too sure what to expect, but I got this. Its a flash game, but with its own spin, its own music that is actually very good with lots of hype moments about it. It has diffirent enemies and guns which each do help with diffirent situations, but its mostly just a hype game that you run through and blast everything you can. In the end, I like this game, its worth a few bucks and buying a game gives money for the company or people to make more games.\n\nAlso its not another god damn zombie game.\n\nEdit: I look now and I realize as the first person to review this, I should explain what I mean by "a flash game". Im sure people can remember being in the computer lab at school or just at a computer, with nothing to do and searching for Flash games on the net. This is such you would come across, but its one step further. Its got better music and lighting then most games, its combat is pretty easy to get and hitboxes work pretty well. It has its bugs, of course, but this is a game you would play to either pass the time, or just have some fun without  having to commit to something long and tasking. So its still a yeah from me, I like it. It reminds me of all those flash games I would play while my teacher was doing something, and easy to alt tab out of if they looked at me.\n\nAlso, its still not another damn zombie game.","March 27, 2015","true","0.8"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

If you get (heavily) discounted or in a bundle, you might want to go for it if you enjoy top down shooter and missing some arcade classics like alien syndrome.\n\nSo why I am not recommending this game.  Well, it still looks and feels like an early access game with almost no configuration of the videos, audios and game controller (My Xbox controller not being well recognized either straight from the bat).  The gameplay could have been enhanced greatly in particular by setting the top down view a little bit higher which would have allowed a better enemy visibility and make the graphics look better.\n\nAdditionaly, the story (if story there is) looks confusing and unfininshed as you are fighting at the start gigantic spider, then humans, then back to spiders...  (That's my take after 6 min of play and not going beyond level 1).\n\nHopefully there will be reworked in the pipeline from the developper for making this game something in the same vein than Alien Breed.","January 23","false","0.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharpincome/recommended/358610/","sharpincome","Sharp Income","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharpincome/","1122 products in account","This game's got a few things going for it, and those things are very well done. But what it's lacking takes too much from the game that it doesn't feel like a whole game at all. At least, it doesn't provide enough depth to be worth the asking price.\n\nAs the other review states, it's like a flash game, one you'd find for free online. That's an accurate description; it plays like a flash game: fast paced and very simple. Unfortunately the price tag doesn't match the simplicity it offers. You could describe it as mindless fun, but to me this phrase conveys the notion of a game that isn't too deep/complicated/sophisticated in it's gameplay systems but yet requires quick, successive tactical decisions based on the immediate situation (as opposed to a thought out strategic approach before facing each conflict/battle in game (do I need to buy more ammo, is my $ better spent on upgrades, is there an alternate approach to the mission). Unfortunately this game doesn't touch on any of that sort of tactical depth that even a simple top down shooter should have.\n\nThe store page mentions "If you like stealth gameplay, you can avoid direct enemy contact and try to outsmart them..." But for the most part, gameplay consists of holding down the fire button of the automatic rifle or shotgun and spamming bullets in front of you as you walk through the level, and only mixing things up when you encounter multiple enemies: now you backpedal as you spam bullets at the enemies (or strafe if you're fighting guards). Yes, this is similar to almost every other top down shooter out there, but... You have access to every weapon on every level and with unlimited ammo and no reload there's no meaningful decision to make about which weapon to use: just use best one for the situation, or whichever is most fun for you. The only thing close to stealth in this game is the ability to bounce grenades off walls to hit enemies around a corner or to just not shoot the enemies that are facing away from you (but if you have to pass them, you have no choice but to shoot them (unless you can dodge every bullet and enemy until you reach the end of the level.))\n\nThe video with the cool graphics and bumpin' music are what sold me on this game (and the sale). The video looks like a collection of the most tense moments of the game, showing some neat popping out from the corner and shooting and frantic running in circles while shooting at the bugs swarming the player. But the latter is the majority of the gameplay. There's no reason to pop out and take shots when you can accomplish the same thing (dodging bullets) by strafing and spamming your own bullets (because there's no reload or ammo to worry about). In the latter case, if you're not backpedalling then you're forced to run in circles or get mauled by the bugs (though backpedalling is ALWAYS the winning strategy- again, leaving you without a meaningful choice to make about how to approach the situation).\n\nThen there's level design. Every level but 3 are linear. There is a labyrinth level which is hardley a maze, but again, still only one direction to go. One is completely open with no hallways, just single obstacles you walk around. And the other level (that actually contains a loop in it!) is the bonus level. It's the best level in the game, lots of enemies and they come at you from different directions at one point.\n\nThere's no story. No text to explain anything, why you're doing what you doing. But hey, the guards are shooting at you so you have to kill them, and the bugs are ugly (and they're bugs), so you have to kill them, too.\n\nSo we're lacking meaningful choices of:\n- What path to take to the end of the level\n- Where/how to move your character in relation to the enemies\n- When to shoot (or conserve ammo)\n- When to kill enemies or slip past them\n- What weapon to use\n(- No choices to affect story)\n\nThe last one I don't count against the game, because not every game needs, or even should have a story that the player can alter. (Interactivity is, for the most part, in the gameplay which is the player's way of being involved in the story the developer is telling through the game.) But I mention it because having it could've added a lot seeing as how the game is lacking so many choices elsewhere.\n\nOther few negatives include no rebindable controls and one set resolution (though you have the option to go fullscreen).\n\nI'm not trying to dissuade anyone from buying this game, I just want to let people know what they're in for. I'd say this game is worth a dollar for some mindless fun. I did find it mildly enjoyable spraying lead into those bugs and seeing the bloody mechanical mess they leave. So let me now mention the positives for this game.\n\n+ Particle effects when you're bullets hit things\nBut also a negative too. They don't look right. Blood is too bright/pale, and then doesn't match the blood color of the bugs.\n\n+ Scientists look like they're dancing (gave me a laugh!)\n\n+ Different Difficulty levels (and ample player health)\nYeah, you're going to get chomped on a few times, so it's good to be able to make like Jesus and be bread for the world and still live. (And also just like Jesus, when you do die, you can always resurrect (and retry the level ;)) Those damn bugs still eatin' you? Try it on an easier difficulty setting.\n\n+ Level editor\nHere you go, make something interesting and invite a friend over to play your level. There's no scripting though.\n\n+ Lighting FX\nNice real-time 2D lighting effects. Makes this look more professional.\n\n+ Good SFX\nPlayer walking sounds are decent and weapon sounds are nice and consistent with the different weapon types. I wish the bugs would make a pinching or chomping noise or something when they attack you (or maybe I just can't hear it?).\n\n+ AWESOME music\nBuy this just for some good music to listen to while you blow the brains out of some bugs.\n\n+ AWESOME character/bug enemy graphics\nCharacter looks great holding each of the weapons and I love the look of the bugs (and their corpses.) The guards are "bleh", though.\n\nSo if you don't mind the negatives I've mentioned (including the price), then I'd say buy this game. It's really just the price that's keeping me from recommending this, as one can still have some fun with it despite all the negatives.","July 25, 2015","false","0.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

This is one of the most expensive games i've came across.\nNo story, no level progression, you just get to load any level from dropdown. Once level is completed, game doesn't even bother selecting next one for you. All weapons are just given to you right away. Full screen is terribly torn apart with lack of vsync, game doesn't remember your music level you had, you have to reset it all the time.\nAbsolute god damn awful trash.","January 23","false","0.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The experience is very barebones here, grab the game on sale, but I like top down shooters and would like to see this expanded. Thanks.\n\nChanged my review to negative as there has been no attempt to update this game since the original posting.
