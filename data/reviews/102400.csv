Basically you move/shoot to color the balls/lines to control more land & spit out more abilities than the enemy.  The game is very basic and also very short.  I beat both episodes in about 2.5 hours.\n\nEach level has different goal, kill the enemy, capture ground, get certain colors, or live X amount of time.\n\nOverall, its ok for what it is.  If you like simple action puzzle games, might be your cup of tea!","March 31, 2012","true","2.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

It's deceptive in that it has the asthetics of a casual game but the gameplay of chess. If you love logic puzzles and playing relaxing games before bed, Vertex Dispenser is recommended.","February 2, 2015","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

We greatly enjoyed the multiplayer vs. A.I. more than anything, though.\n\nThe main shortcoming is the extreme minimalism.  The game could do with a bit of polish in its UI and graphics.  Simple doesn't have to mean sloppy. Nevertheless, one of my favorites in the genre since the first Hexxagon.","August 2, 2015","true","19.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now I realize I was wrong.\nI commend the creator for doing something very different, and not trying to dumb down the mechanics.  I am also completely overwhelmed by the sheer number of different abilities all mapped to separate keys and the boggling amount of information changing at an inhumanly quick pace.  I feel like super advanced AI would love playing this game, but I am a mere human.","March 2, 2014","false","0.5"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","5","10","2","0"

It's also a lot of fun. It's fast paced. It's action. It's strategy. It's a puzzle game.

I want to describe it sort of as a puzzle-RTS? The only 'resources' are the color of points you control, allowing abilities to recharge faster the more of X color node you have. Try the demo? I straight up can't give a good confirm/deny if you'd like this one with ease like some other things. This is a competent little title that I just blow goats at.","August 31, 2012","true","2.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's just that it's very difficult to get the right setup. At higher levels you don't even get the chance to setup something correctly, you just bash as hard as you can to try to defeat the cheating AI. Just think of starting with a power of 1 versus 5, and this time it's not really strategy, because your just by yourself.
