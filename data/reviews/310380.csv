You need to play at LEAST ten matches (~4-5 h playtime) to actually get into the whole system. Many of the negative reviews are from players that have no clue how ANYTHING works and start to complain about it here. I know now after a couple of weeks the reviews I am talking about have more playtime than at the point when they wrote it but they never changed or updated the review to say whether it's better now or not.\n\nReview:\n\nOkay, I played this game now since the first free weekend back in April 2015 and two weeks ago I reached my 1000th hour of playtime in Fractured Space. Updates are coming frequently with a lot of content and new stuff which is tested by the community. In the last weeks after ECG had released their biggest patch ever for this game a lot of people came to this site to write a negative review and whine about stuff that is completeley new without having it tested for about a week. This stuff is now tested and it works. Not perfect but way better than a week after the patch.\n\nAFTER THE UPDATE\n\nWe got a new Crew System which makes it harder to get the crewmembers (they give you some extra % on your ship like damage, damage reduction, cooldown on abilities, etc.). I am not a fan of this system but I waited a bit for ECG to listen to the community and so they did. They are still changing the system to make it less and less bad. And so they did. I personally think they should still increase the chance of getting a crewtemplate which is needed to unlock the crews. You get them after  2 (Bronze Drop),4 (Silver Drop) and 6 (Gold Drop - highes chance of course) games.\n\nENGINE AND GRAPHICS\n\nAs the game is running on Unreal Engine 4 the graphics just look amazing in it. Unfortunately the last big patch killed the performance for a lot of players but that happened after almost every content patch. ECG is doing their best to get the performance up again so that players with less powerfull computers can still play it. They anounced that a performance patch will come in the next weeks probably with the next content update. The details of the ship are just astonishing. They put so much work into the look of the ships that I actually dont want to fight with it but look at it for hours. Same for a lot of the animations especially the different Jump Drive animations. When it comes to sound the game gets a big plus from me too but some ships sounds are not powerfull enough even though they deal a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of damage when played right (i.e. the Gladiator: sounds got already improved but still sound like that it's shooting balls instead of bullets as big as my house).\nSomething I miss are the small animations on ships like opening some claps when missiles are fired. often they are launched out of the nowhere (i.e. Colossus or Destroyer).\n\nGRINDING\n\nSomething actually no one likes to hear but even Fractured Space has it. In January 2016 a big wipe deleted all the progress to start the actuall grinding of the game. Before that the ships where easy to unlock so everyone could test them. Now they cost ten times the amount they did before. A normal player needs about 600 matches to unlock everything (loadouts included). This game is NOT Pay2Win as you can't buy EXP which is needed to unlock the ships. However you can buy Platinum which is the premium currency in FS and then buy the ships with it. But if you decide to do it like that you would be poor really soon as Platinum is really expensive and the ships cost a lot of it (i.e. 1k Plat = 5€, highest ships cost 4470 Plat where you would need to pay 25€). So if you are not rich just don't bother to get the normal ships with Plat.\n\nSHIPS\n\nThe heart of the game. There are three different manufacturers: USR - United Space Research (could NASA from the looks), Zarek (Industrial) (are probably the russians) and TDS - Titan Defense Research (China...).\nThere are three different classes: Support, Defense and Attack. Every ship has another class ship describes the size and mass of it which are Smallcraft, Mediumcraft and Heavycraft.\nAll manufacturers have at least one type of each shipclass but play most of the time completely different. Then there is another class which tells you the needed skill to play the ship correctly (Tier 1 to 7). Of course for Tier 7 you need a lot of skill but they are NOT automatically better even though they are at the end of the techtree. As the devs said: "All ships are balanced to play against each other. As you move up the Techtree, the ships require more knowledge of the game to play."\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThe gameplay itself is just awesome. Atleast if you are willing to have fun. Like in any other multiplayer game you get into games that are just frustrating and have zero fun. I see a lot of highly skilled players from different clans that are taking things too serious like they always play in a tournament. Fun ship combinations are rarely seen and when we meet them they always go with tryhard combinations so they just win this game without big effort. Fun combinations are rare in their team. The fights between two ships or more are simply awesome. A lot of players compare this game to Dreadnought where I have to say that Fractured Space is the more tactical variant and Dreadnought is better for casual players. To be honest you won't see a lot of tactics in the random matches mostly because of the lack of communication with the random players that get into your team and the big difference in skill. Playing in tournaments is the real thing. It's nothing like the random matches. You can truely feel the skill in the teams and how every single step is well thought to win the matches. If you want to see some tournament matches I recommend you to go to the forums and search for the "80k Tournament" and the "3vs3 Tournament" threads. Somewhere in there are streams of the tournaments where highly skilled players compete.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nI end my review here by saying that you if you want to play this game you should go to the forums and search for some players to play with. Playing it alone is way less fun and way more difficult to get into the game. Don't hesitate to ask any players for advice if you think you could need some. There will always be some players that don't understand that others players might not be as good as they are but the majority of the playerbase is there to help you.","May 21","true","090.1"," 429 of 488 people (88%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","88","429","488","23","19"

All sectors have control points you need to capture in order to advance and eventually make your way to enemy base. During combat you can freely fly in the battlefield, warp into sectors where the combat is currently going on and warp back to base to regroup or to run away with your nearly destroyed ship for repairs.\n\nThere's currently 15 different ship types in game, 3 of them unlocked right at the start. Ship types fit for many roles: long range, hard hitting sniper boat, heavily armored flagship for more close range combat, sneaky & stealthy assassin ship, fast moving frigate etc. As the game is currently in it's early stages, it understandably might have some balance issues between various ship designs - though I personally feel like every ship has their own use and an organized group will easily take down those solo snipers or assassins who think they can/should be able to kill everything themselves.\n\nPROs:\nAwesome ship design\nWell made level\nGraphics, sfx\n\nCONs\n1(one) level\nVery low playerbase (seen max of 54)\nLevel Matching system(isn't one)\nNo real training/tutorials\n\nFor an EARLY ACCESS game, its good, Its not super great, but its really entertaining.

But I saw multiple reviews saying those were from a previous generation of the game, and sure enough, all negative reviews stop around 10 months ago. Since then apparently there have been major updates and improvements, and you can check the updates, the Devs are still very active. That said, this may be an early access game, but it doesn't much feel like it. There are at least 2 or 3 dozen ships to choose from, and the games runs at a minimum of 60 fps for me, more often at around 70 or 80.\n\nIf you want a legitimate, space battlecruiser fighting game, give it a shot. After just 3 days I have completely fallen in love with this game, and there is enough depth and variation between each game that I don't see it getting old any time soon. If you like LoL, Smite, or any other Mobas (I don't really care for them, but I love this game), then bite the bullet and give it a try.

That's huge.\n\nThis is a solid game at it's core. The last major patch added a crew collection system which was grindy and unsatifying. The community voiced it's opinion, and the devs saw that and responded. They apologized and are working to make reparations towards the players. Never before have I seen something of this caliber from game devs. Just because of this, I had to come write this review. Seriously, don't let the negative reviews scare you off if you are interested in playing the game. After all, it's free now, so it can't hurt to try.\n\nI had avoided MOBA games like a plauge until I saw this one and was immediately interested. It has yet to dissapoint me.

These are all very basic and I will assume what you spend will be expanded in the future, like upgrading just your engines  or buying stronger lasers etc. Right now thats all stat based.\n\nLoadouts are very basic at the moment with only a few options for weapons and abilites.\n\nThere are 6 ships out as of now, but all have a unique playstyle and can counter each other, for example assassins have a inital advantage vs flagships due to there long range weapons, but up close a flagship will be able to do much more damage.\n\nThe performance sadly is were this game falls short, I have a GTX 760 and 8GB of ram and im struggling, but im sure this will be patched out in time.\n\n\nTL;DR Very interesting MOBA style space game, wait for more patches before you buy.","January 8, 2015","true","20.9"," 72 of 86 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","72","86","0","0"

The movement is slow since they're big mother ships, but some (maybe it's just one) ships you can utilize to blink/jump short distances, which aside from looking cool, adds a good advantage to deal more damage if done correctly.\n\nSo the game at the moment (20/11/2014) has six ships and a conquest mode, pick your ship, it's crew, and go own your battle, a 5 vs 5 conquest match, with 7 major points, and 6 mini points to conquer. There isn't much else to say at the moment with the game being in alpha and all, with it comes bugs and little content, but overall I'm seeing this game hitting a good spot with it's nice price of 10 dollars, I think it's worth it, don't know if the price will go up but if you want an awesome experience I (hopefully) suspect that'll come around late beta stage, then give it a wait, but if you don't mind what you get now, then go ahead and get it.\n\nWhat the game needs now is a good tutorial (also don't expect anything aside from 5 players, with their respective mother ships, against other 5 players of the same), more optimization, polish, and content.

In the last couple of months the developers have released an additional 5 ships, all with unique abilities and gameplay styles. Expanding on an already impressive collection of ships.\n\nWith over 20 ships you can choose a gameplay style to suit your character, mood, and opposing team, for example:\n\nPlay as a sniper, with a long range gun, picking off enemies half way across the map, while scared someone is going to jump on you from behind.\nPlay as a corvette, a ship with the ability to heal allies, and act as a floating shield.  What it lacks in damage output, it makes up in team cooperation and tactics.\nPlay as an infiltrator, the ability to fly across the map invisible, plant multiple explosive drones onto the hull of your enemy, before triggering a massive explosion.\nPlay as a hunter, a nimble ship with the ability to detect invisible enemies, the ability to teleport across distances to capture objectives, and employ evasive tactics to win dog fights.\nPlay as a reaper, an attack craft with the unique combination of weapons that allow you to damage armour, and deal heavy damage.  Limited angle of fire, but equipped with a short term shield which can assist when flanked.\nPlay as a brawler, a close range attack craft that can deal impressive damage when up close, and the ability to 'harpoon' enemies and reel them in close.\nPlay as a raven, a small ship with an impressive attack beam, which can only be fired after stealing energy from other ships.\nIf they don't sound like fun, then you can play as some of the more traditional ships like the flagship, destroyer, carrier, or leviathan, variations on the battle cruiser class ship, each with its own pros and cons.\n\nThe gameplay is heavily team and objective based. While a lot of games are played just using the in game communication, the real fun starts once you communicate with your team mates using voice. While the game lacks a voice system at the moment, the developers provide a teamspeak server, and a number of clans run their own.\n\nThat said, there are a number of issues with the game. Since the developers are constantly adding new features, and ships, the game is a constant state of needing rebalancing. While this is an ongoing process, there are some weeks where you find some ships are over powered, or your favourite strategy has become unviable. In the past few months, we have seen the carrier ship flop between being overpowered, and underpowered as the dev's fail to get the balance just right. This is more than acceptable throughout the alpha and beta stages of any game. Some of the other bugs that have shown up throughout the alpha have been worse, but as it stands, the game is massively playable, and I've put in a large number of hours, trying out new strategies and the gameplay mutates.","October 15, 2015","true","147.0"," 45 of 50 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","45","50","3","0"

This review covers the game as it was on April 17, 2015 and includes feedback from developers regarding a temporary fix for rebinding keys for gameplay.  I FULLY suspect this rating will improve drastically over time.\n\nSo far, this appears to be a Control Points type game where you and your team of 4 other players try to capture stations in different quadrants to gain resources for ship upgrades that ultimately help you capture the enemy station.  Both teams fight for control of these stations and team members must work together to simultaneously capture points for your team and prevent the opponent from capturing for theirs.\n\nSome Alpha stage problems do exist.\n- First, it is difficult to get into a server - I often experience a failed join with no explanation as to why that is.\n- Second, the basics of the game are in place, such as an initial set of ships and crew, but more are to be added, and there are some aspects of crew arrangement that seem to be placeholders for future functionality only.\n- Third, as it is now, I have not seen any real tutorial for out-of-play experience (such as crew, ship selection and upgrading, and tech tree) to explain the details of what is what.\n- Finally, the control schema for the game is only accessible outside of gameplay via the Hub interface rather than through game options.\n\nOn the plus side, the gameplay itself is fluid when you get into it and the currently available game mode is relatively easy to grasp without a steep learning curve.  Further, there is currently a rudimentary technology tree that offers different ships (and different styles of gameplay) based on an in-game credit system that currently requires no micro payments.\n\nIn its early stages, players seem to still be developing tactics for successful team play and I can see this game improving into something both challenging and fun to play with friends over time.\n\nGeneral Accessibility\nAccessibility Options\n+ You CAN edit options before playing the game.\n+ HOH gamers CAN adjust audio controls separately for master volume, music, effects, and voice.\n\n+/- Players with mobility issues can NOT currently rebind keys from inside the game, but the developers will add this feature soon.

(Aiming, leading targets, beautiful explosions and sassy crews.) The fact that I feed off space sims and worship the Homeworld series probably biases me a bit, but oh well. Here we go.\n\nI'd have to say it's pretty fun, surprisingly. But there's a few points to keep in mind, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.\n\nWe can start with visuals. It's not bad in the looks department, but you don't have a huge selection for what you want on or off. (I'd love to turn off blur, but alas..) The only thing I find overwhelmingly cheesy is the Reaper's side-shield aesthetic. The maps are pretty simplistic, the bases even painfully moreso- It's upsetting seeing such pretty ships fly past such ugly stations.\n\nAnother pain is the camera positioning. Some may like it, some may not, I personally find it workable but a little bit chaotic- It can toy with your situational awareness and clips with nearby objects on occassion, and the secondary view with zoom is fixated on a sphere outside of the ship, so using it up close isn't ideal. You do get to look at that awfully pretty ship from third person, though. Even if it takes up more of your screen than is ideal.\n\nWhat makes up for this is the gameplay. No fight is the same, and they range from slow to fast and in-your-face. It's incredibly unique that it nearly makes up for there only being one map. Forgive me if I sound a little passionate- I really enjoy the combat in this game.\n\nGameplay is really straightforwards- Five ships head against eachother for resources to improve their ships (Done automatically at the larger bases & home) and ultimately to capture the enemy base to secure victory. You've got five zones, pushing up through the outer two and hitting the middle when 'gas' pops up. (Capture the point to gain a boost to your firing, not always worth it mind you)\n\nBecause of how that works, kills aren't overly important until later in the game when respawning has increased from ~10 seconds to ~50+. You'll still want them though, since you get bonus XP/Credits for them, but your team can win a game with a nasty negative team K/D ratio.\n\nAdvancement is simple. You earn manufacturer points + credits from playing, and spend them to unlock + purchase ships or upgrades. (There aren't a lot of them yet.) In four rounds playing a certain manufacturer's ship, you should have enough to buy another ship.\n\nTheir to-do list looks pretty honest and leaves me hopeful that they'll stay true to their development. FOV sliders, new ships, a friends list, yes please and all in planned development. (Ideally.)\n\nMy recommendations are as follows..\nRead the ship descriptions. They aren't lying when they point out a weakness/strength, and make sure you learn the ranges of your abilities. Each ship has their strengths and weaknesses against other ships and you'll learn these by playing them, so plan accordingly at the start of the match @ ship selection. Calling things OP is silly- Nothing is gamebreaking. Nothing.\n\nCoordinate with your team! There's a voice chat and there's a chat box. Communication is vital. Please please please.\n\nDO NOT TRASH TALK. You rarely pick your team and you could get teamed with someone who you were so rudely insulting that last match. Don't embarrass yourself, don't be that person. Play clean and get along with your team & enemies. Grudges are dumb on this.\n\nWatch your important UI elements. Map awareness is extremely important, the game is surprisingly fast paced at times.\n\nFriends are food. You might play with them or against them at the mercy of team balancing and other players, but it's nice to hear them curse when you blow them up. I suggest playing with them on voips for this.\n\nAnd as always, keep in mind that this game is in alpha and there will always be room for improvement! Changes are (almost) always bound to come!","June 21, 2015","true","54.6"," 43 of 48 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","43","48","6","0"

Used in a team effort with flanking manuveurs and jumping in at the right times and order could turn the tide of a battle quickly.   I beleive it is worth playing and learning all these elements to really get the most out of the game.   A lot of people seem to be giving it a quick 10 minute play and passing judgement....which just isnt possible.\n\nThis isnt a frantic speedy dogfighting game....this is a space battle with HUGE ships and epic scale. You are not going to have fast moving dodge and actiony stuff going on. the ships feel slow and lumbering.....but they are probably moving at extremely fast speeds and covering distances very quickly....but you cannot tell this without some sense of scale.  just imagine how large the ship you are controlling really is and look at how far you have to go to reach your destination and then see how long it takes. it feels like a long time but if you use some thought and logic its actually pretty quick when you consider the largest ship is like as big as the empire state building or larger and you just moved it a few miles in 10 seconds.....      ive seen some reviews say its slow and cumbersome and laggy...i dont think these people understand the scale and scope of what they are even looking at lol\n\nAs far as game performance goes i havent had any of the issues ive seen others mention. the menus work fine for me and the game stays at 60FPS average and drops to the 40s rarely when crazy stuff is happening but it doesnt feel like its hoppy i just saw it drop on the fps counter so it wasnt a problem for me.

It is a fun game to play when you can find a server with other players. Nothing feels quite like seeing a enemy use his missile barrage and than blinking to him and unleashing a full broadside of rockets in his face as his wasted missiles fly out into space. What they have in game now is fun all in itself and I for one am looking forward to the future updates. I have been wnating a game where can fight in capital ships for a long time now. The little details that they have in here is awesome too. When your ship is moving up or strafing left or right little thrusters along the hull can be seen firing. I like the ships style as well. The ships are something that looks like it belongs a hundred years in our future and not like slabs of metal that can shoot from wherever. Your turrets are mounted and can be seen turning and take time to rotate around. A match that I recently played I was flying the Assassin ship, which I believe is a cruiser or a destroyer class vessel. This thing is quite fast and hits pretty hard. Strafing runs are nice in this vessel. I could zoom by enemy capitals faster than thier turrents could track. To the dev's if you see this. Keep up the great work and I cannot wait to see what else you have in store for us.","November 21, 2014","true","27.3"," 39 of 44 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","39","44","0","0"

There are three classes. Support, Defense, and full on assault. Now the pros of the game: Well made so far (sorta).\n\nPros: Supports can defend themselves (unlike other Mobas Ive played) Warps (Teleport) are changed with your class (I think thats Balenced) for example, the supports can warp out in 3 seconds, and the flagships can warp out in 10. Multitude of strains for your ships. Some ships CANNOT take on other ships alone. For Example a support versus a hunter. Support is screwed right? well not exactly, due to the supports superior warping in and out time (3 seconds) they can leave the scene before they come back and finish you off. If you are attcked while warping in or out, you take 500% more damage. So warping out in combat isnt always an option (Tried it ten times at least, got away 2 times total).\n\nCons: Some ships are obviously over powered. For example, the "Hunter" (or whatever it is called) can go invisble and are undetectable unless a certain ship is there with the detect ability. Heal beams can heal your enemy too... so thats good if a teammate wont hold still I end of healing the enemy... then we are both dead. It also opens up a portal to troll land. Where all the trolls play supports and heal the enemy (I know right perfect). I was disapointed to hear that I cannot ram my enemy as a last ditch effort for damage. You can ram them sure, but it doesnt do anything. Also hitting astroids at very high speeds... well... you bounce off like a ball on a wall. No damage done to you. On to some other rather important missing feautres. You CANNOT change your key binds (like seriously? WTF). Final Con: No playable tutorial, they provide you with a short video that is not totaly clear, they give objectives nad the main goal, but no real play advice. Long story short: Tutorial almost non-existant.\n\nIn the end I would have to make my statement and say: This game is not finished (or anywhere near it), it needs serious user support (friends list, keybinds, ect). I did enjoy this game though, and I will be playing more. I do recommend this game to users who like the moba genre.

All sectors have control points you need to capture in order to advance and eventually make your way to enemy base. During combat you can freely fly in the battlefield, warp into sectors where the combat is currently going on and warp back to base to regroup or to run away with your nearly destroyed ship for repairs.\n\nThere's currently 15 different ship types in game, 6 of them unlocked right at the start. Ship types fit for many roles: long range, hard hitting sniper boat, heavily armored flagship for more close range combat, sneaky & stealthy assassin ship, fast moving frigate etc. As the game is currently in it's early stages, it understandably might have some balance issues between various ship designs - though I personally feel like every ship has their own use and an organized group will easily take down those solo snipers or assassins who think they can/should be able to kill everything themselves.\n\nAll ships have 6 different skills at the start, some more offensive, some more defensive. As you play and get more experience, you can unlock more skills and customize your ship's loadout. There's currently 2 different crews to choose and it looks like you could probably fine tune the crew skills in future too, though I'm not 100% sure of that.\n\nThere aren't currently any tutorials, tips or guides in-game and everything feels like they're subject to change. Figuring out the skills on the fly is doable, but Steam's community hub has already some starting guides to help you avoid the Trial and Error-method.\n\nGame is very enjoyable, fun and has a lot of potential.","December 10, 2014","true","2.3"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","36","41","0","0"

My turn for one of these:\n\nTL;DR If you like giant space ships and MOBAs, you need to be playing this yesterday.\n\nFractured Space is, at it's core, a simpler MOBA game. However, many of the more well-used MOBA bits and bobs have been thrown out, and for the better. There are no shops to comb though, builds to learn, creeps to farm and keep track of for pushing, or ultimate abilities that completely change the power level of things once level X has been reached. You have everything at the start of the game, as it should be.\n\nIt's just you, your team, your ships, and a few stations to battle over. You may think that would make things simple, but you would be wrong.\n\nInstead, the complexity is moved to the ships. Each ship has a set of abilities, with loadout options you can get to alter those abilities slightly(WIP), armor facings to manage, and ways to complement your allies.\n\nThis is what makes Fractured Space great. You don't get stuck having to do tons of learning just so you can have a good time with the game, you just have to take a few minutes to understand what everything on the map is for, what your ship does, and you will be set. That is not to say that there is not a deep, deep dive into things to be had if you want to get into more competitive side, but you don't have to spend hours combing through guides to at least be alright. Low skill floor, very high skill ceiling.\n\nIf you want to spend some cash, you have plenty of options. Tons of skins at various price levels, some premium ships that look fantastic, and boosters that you can apply WHENEVER YOU WANT! None of that “Well, you had a booster running for X games and they were all ♥♥♥♥, suck to be you!” If you had a baller game, you drop those boosters on that game, and can save any others for the next time you carry the team on your broad, meaty shoulders.\n\nAll in all, Fractured Space is the game I did not know I wanted, and am honestly happy to be existing at the same time as.","May 26","true","935.1"," 46 of 58 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","46","58","0","2"

They seem to be focused on the art design of the game in their dev blogs, when gameplay and mechanics are far from finalized. This is especially frustrating for current supporters of the game, when we are expecting progress towards a more complete game and they continue to release more skins (microtransactions) to seemingly milk out their already limited player base. When this is a game regarded as a paid early access alpha and you prioritize microtransactions, you aren't selling an early access game but instead a final product, and this game is far from finalized. With these thoughts in mind here's the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n-excellent graphics and effects\nCons:\n-Poor game balance (Certain ships are entirely outclassed by other ships)\n-Endless Microtransactions\n-Toxic and limited playerbase (The game's only major clan, He3, is present in most games and do not provide the healthiest of conversations to say the least)\n-Ban-happy Developers*\n\n* I mention this, because of a few cases that I know of where bans have been issued for seemingly no reason or justification. Especially when this is supposedly in early access development, I find it extremely disturbing that a company would focus on banning players to protect it's player base of at best 200 people from petty arguments during a match.\n\nIn conclusion, this game would be wildly successful if the developers get their priorities straight. But as of now it doesn't look like this will happen and I suggest staying away from this game.\n\n*In response to the Developer's comment*\n\nThe "Intentionally Impersonating to cause disruption" was simply a name change that was satirical in nature towards this particular clan, especially for their notable regard for being extremely negative in games. No other provacation was done, and simply changing the steam username was enough to recieve an immense amount of harassment from these members, and to my surprise later lead to a no-warning ban of my account which was noticed after about a week of inactivity. I mention in my review that others have been banned for "seemingly no reason" because, as per further investigation, many other former players recieved similar bans for reasons that they were unable to identify. In my own case, it was simply from a single name change that criticized this player organization. Absolutely no profanity or derogative language was used at all.\n\nTo further illustrate a point, the fact that a community representitive has taken the time to single out one player's review of this game (Out of 1500 reviews), shows their desperate attempt to clear out any possible criticism of this game, especially since the response is " This guy was banned, don't listen to him.". Take from this reveiw what you will, but I would not have such a negative view of this game if it wasn't for the  poor management from the developers in many different regards, not just in terms of my own case.","April 10","false","120.7"," 89 of 129 people (69%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","69","89","129","6","18"

The latest patch looked as if it would breath new life into the game, but instead it has just turned Fractured Space into a massive grind for in-game currencies and experience, which can only be averted by spending real world $$ on cases which offer small amounts of them randomly. Unlocking crew members for the ships (giving % bonuses) is exceedingly difficult, as you earn the ability to use them them randomly from case spins, THEN HAVE TO PAY DNA (type of exp) TO UNLOCK THEM FOR YOUR SHIP! On top of that the balance for the game is terrible, they have rendered half of the ships impotent and the other half invincible, and instead of trying to fix balance issues they just LOCK ships from being used again (e.g. the Paragon).\n\nI have just spent 3 hours playing the 6 game requisite for all the free cases you are entitled to each 24 hour period AND THEY GIVE NOTHING. From those 3 cases, I earned as much exp and credits equal to playing a 7th game: for 3 hours of effort, I recieved ~30 minutes of reward. What an absolute farce.\n\nThe fact that this patch was a giant cash grab and didnt even add the ability to make a full 5 man party is probably the most insulting aspect of it. I still can't party with my friends to slog through this inane grind for cases, instead I have to deal with the near endless stream of infantile players who don't understand that this game is about capturing objectives and not running around looking for easy kills & leaving you to die when things get rough.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rsdr/recommended/310380/","rsdr","[POEX] SDR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rsdr/","320 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME. I'm not a big fan of common multiplayer games like "CS" or "TF" (well, since I suck at them), very popular MMO-team based games like "World of Tanks" or "War Thunder" (because it's pay 2 win) and especially MOBA games (because they suck), but in Fractured Space I've found a perfect mixture of all these multiplayer games. It's a team based 5v5 multiplayer vehicle shooter there you PIERCE THE SKY on a gigantic spaceships. Unlike other spaceship shooters, ships here are not some crazy hyperspeed flying toasters, which you can't normally control and targeting the enemy's ship will make you puke. No, ships here are pretty slow, and that's really good. First - it's logical since they are really big and their size can be compared to some in-game asteroids. Second - because of this game is more based on a tactics like good teamplay and knowing ships' strong and weak points.\n\nThere are "tanks" like Flagship and Destroyer, fast attacking ships like Reaper, Hunter, Enforcer or Frigate, special ships like Sniper (the name says it all), Assassin (same here, stealth ship), Brawler (not so fast pretty strong attacking ship, but he can pull other ships right to him to destroy them at close range in a blink of an eye) and support ships like Corvette, Disruptor and Equalizer. There are a total of 12 ships for now and their number is growing as game development progressing. I haven't tried all of the ships yet, but judging on my game experience I can say that their balancing is very good. There are no "best" of "worst" ships here (although after progressing and getting new ships you will likely not to use some of the first ones) and every ship have his natural enemies. For example: enemy Sniper can make your team's life very hard, but good Brawler player can destroy that deadly, but porcelain beauty. So main goal here is to learn all ships' strong and weak points and choose your ship (that can be done only once in a match, so pay attention to enemy team's ships before match starts) and attack ships that have disatvantages to yours.\n\nBut this game is not only about killing other ships and getting frags - there are some MOBA-like capture the base elements. All map is divided into 5 star systems and you have to use hyperdrive jump to reach them. Each team has a Home Base with 2 Mining stations (they gather resources to level up during match). Center system is a Gas Station which gives a controlling team a lot of bonuses, but can be captured only three times in a match and during specific time. And side systems are Forward systems called Alpha and Beta which connects two teams bases and have 3 Mining Stations each. To get to the enemy's base you have to capture opposing forward base which is pretty hard, since enemy players will try to defend it. To understand game mechanic's you better watch a few gameplay videos, but I can tell you that it's well designed and really entertaining.\n\nAnd main plus of this game is that it's not Pay2Win and developers say that they will not change this. It's still in Alpha stage of development and it's very stable and already has a lot of content to enjoy this game. I've picked it on Free Weekend and get it forever, but now you have to spent a few bucks to get the game with one of the Early Access packs. When development will reach stable phase devs will make this game Free2Play.\n\nI recommend this game to every lover of team-based shooters and space games. Even though I've got this game for free I'll buy one of the Early Access pack to support game development.","April 26, 2015","true","377.1"," 36 of 43 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","36","43","2","11"

The gameplay is very assymetrical and you are likely to find a ship that fits your playstyle very quickly.  If you want to sneak around and tear your foes a new one then play the assassin.  If you want to go in guns blazing pick the flagship, but don't forget to bring a healer!  If you want to help your friends but can't hit water if you fell off a boat pick the corvette and green beam your allies to better health.  If you want to help your team and let the enemy wonder why they are losing then play the disrupter.  If your up for a challenging but very rewarding/balanced ship then pick the hunter.  If you prefer to sit around and make everyone else do all the work then pick the carrier, if you want to yell IMA FIREN MA LAZOR then pick the leviathan.  If you want your enemies to "get over here" pick the brawler.  If caping bases is all you care about pick the enforcer.  If you like big guns and you cannot lie pick the destroyer.  If you love to hide behind a shield and poke people to death then play the frigate.  If you want to be the guy everyone hides from be the sniper.  If you want to learn how to play stick with me and lord Cryoraptor will protect you ^_^ .  Lets not forget the dev's are on in the afternoon every Thursday and they are the nicest dev's I've ever met on any game.

It is a continuous decisions are not easy and when you find yourself facing a firefight the voltage rises quickly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/exaemo/recommended/310380/","exaemo","Exaemo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/exaemo/","824 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA good game even at the Alpha stage.\n\nIt is a MOBA-style game: 5v5 teams, class-based charaacters (or rather, ships), lanes BUT no creeps, no towers and no "jungle".\n\nIt uses a twitch/simulator style of control where you move your ship with WASD keys and aim your weapons (and abilities) with your mouse, instead of clicking somewhere on the screen where you want the ship to go.\n\nInstead of travelling with your teams creeps down a lane that is protected by turrets - there are two bases and several capture points in each of two lanes which give your side advantages (in the form of automatic upgrades for your ships) as well as access to the teams base (via capture of the two bases in a lane.\n\nRather than winning by destroying the enemy defenses and ultimately torching their "ancient" (like in DOTA...or any other fantasy MOBA) you actually have to CAPTURE the enemy base to win. Think of capture points in Team Fortress 2, where a superior number of the enemy will cause the capture point to slowly turn to your side and a superior number of defenders will halt that capture. The capture % does not go down, so once you've made some progress in capturing the enemy base, that progress will not be lost...and the same applies to your base being captured as well.\n\nThat's the basic overview of the game "rules".\n\nAs for the actual gameplay, as I've mentioned you manually control your ship, and there are various ships fulfilling various roles for the team. Tanks, close range damage dealer, long range damage dealer, interceptor, support/healer, etc. There are only a few ship classes avaliable from the start and the more you use a class the more research points you gain to unlock further variations/classes.\n\nSince its a MOBA, there will be an element of customisation, of course. In Fractured Space, that element is the actual ships Crew, as well as the ships abilities.Various crew members give various attributes to your ship, allowing you to fine tune how you want to play with your chosen ship. You can have more than one crew set and swap them around prior to starting a game. You start with two pre-made crew sets; The Renegades and The Mercenaries. You can change the crew set's names as well as the crew members. To get new/other crew members, you have to purchase them in game.\n\nYou can further customise the ship by changing the main weapons it uses as well as its core abilities. These are more "change of flavour" types of customisation rather than outright completely different weapons/abilities making the various classes more predictable in terms of gameplay. For example, you can trade speed for damage on your main cannons, while changing your Flagship's drone swarm to do more slowing rather than damaging to the enemy ship, etc.\n\nThe devs play with other players every Thursday and the game is CONSTANTLY updated, meaning that you must give thought to how old a video is if you're looking for gameplay footage. You will notice differences in the UI, new ships, etc depending on how old a video is - so don't watch something that's a year old and expect it to be how the game is at the moment.\n\nAs for the game packs, they aren't necessary but are worth while.\n\nMy 2c.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy reply to Holy Athena's comment:\n\nActually, there are aspects of MOBA in this game, except you have to interpret them more openly than just going "nah, you're wrong, get ♥♥♥♥ed".\n\nThe territories that your team's ships have to go through are akin to lanes in other MOBA games - you have to choose a path to go to in engaging your enemy. Simply because you have to warp to them does not divorce them from being similar to lanes.\n\nThere are no creeps, as I've obviously said at the very top of my review. One absent aspect does not make Fractured Space a completely original and inspired-by-nothing game.\n\nThere is equipment to buy, but it is bought outside of the match, in the main menu instead of having you rush back to base and then spending precious time going through a shopping list. Again, just because it’s done differently does not mean it isn't there at all.\n\nThere are no towers to destroy or attack the opposing team, but there are outposts that need to be captured and provide a barrier to the enemy from advancing AS WELL AS gaining resources that ultimately upgrade the entire team's ships on a whole. Again, you fail to make the connection simply because you’re approaching this black on white, as narrow as possible.\n\nLastly, considering all of the above, it is very much a type of MOBA game and the fact that it does things different actually works in its favour - it is a fresh take on the genre and translates into intense ship-to-ship battles and rewards team coordination immensely.","August 4, 2015","true","11.6"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","32","37","3","4"

The quickest I've ever found a game is about 3 minutes. Usually the more common scenario is that you'll sit in line to play for 3 minutes and then someone leaves the queue and it causes you to start all over. 10 minutes to find a game seems more realistic. And if your 10th player can't be found the game will occasionally start at 4vs5 which is completely unfair.\n\nThe game itself has everything I wanted from Eve Online without any of the nonsense like griefing and grinding to get resources. There's 3 base ships they give you to start out and they're all great, I find myself going back and using them after unlocking more advanced ones. Sure there's definitely balance issues but it's still in early access.\n\nNow, in my opinion I think the way the devs have focused so much on microtransactions, skins, and premium packages and not on things that are debilitating to the game such as the matchmaking and disconnects that will eventually ruin the game.\n\nI sure hope that doesn't happen and that matchmaking will be more streamlined in the future.

Fractured space has LONG (20-40 minute) battles. A mix of the old-stlye X-Wing & Wing commander space game physics - meaning it's not like an FPS at all. The strategy is simple: your team must control mines to get enhancements, and you need enhancements to overcome the enemy and take over their base. But the tactics are what is very different. A handful of battleships slugging it out around asteroids requires different skill than normal shooters where 'spray & pray' works. To top it off each ship and loadout changes gameplay, as does the loadout of your opponent.\n\nThe downside is.... 20-40 minute battles, and at times not enough players.

If you're into pure space sims, of which there aren't that many of, then you might be a little surprised by Fractured Space.\n\nFractured Space, at its core, is a MOBA. It has more in common with LoL or DoTA than space combat sims. In fact, I'd hesitate to call this a space sim. I simply say that because, while yes, you do control huge starships with a variety of weapons and 'abilities', and yes the armour on each side of your starship is tracked, other than that the game doesn't really try to go into any deeper 'simulation'. Movement is entirely free, but it's not realistic in terms of space physics. Your health is tracked by a simple number.\n\nIn many ways you'll find traditional LoL/DoTA mechanics 'translated' so that they make sense on a sci fi starship theme. If you've played Beyond Earth, you'll probably understand that already.\n\nI bought into the game not really sure what to expect, and I'm not a MOBA fan. I don't enjoy LoL or DoTA. At first I was disappointed at what appeared to be fairly shallow sim mechanics, but the deeper and more interesting parts of the game lie in teamwork and co-ordination, as well as pulling off a successful move or combo that sends your opponent up in flames.\n\nTLDR; from my perspective, even though it's a bit disappointing for someone who was expecting an in-depth multiplayer starship sim game, it can still be incredibly fun as a space themed MOBA and will be a totally viable alternative in the MOBA market when it releases.\n\nI would recommend, though, that unless you wish to directly support the developers, avoid 'buying' the game before it releases. Simply my opinion on F2P games that require purchase to access early-access. It's early, it's not finished and is a little content light at the moment.\n","April 9, 2015","true","14.3"," 49 of 72 people (68%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","68","49","72","5","0"

So I will.\n\nOkay, first off, I love this game. It's a moba without the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t grind for farm, with reasonably timed games decided by strength of tactics and skill. Unlike, say DotA, where cancer picks win the game (lookin at you Ogre Magi, Jakiro offlane. That ♥♥♥♥ is broken).\n\nThe graphics are top notch and the game runs butter smooth even on my 5 year old comp with max settings. Unreal Engine 4, I love you.\n\nThe audio of the game is beautiful. I'm not really an audiophile, so I can't talk about bitrates or samples or whatever. All I know is that when my Captain taunts the dude I just killed, it makes me happy. The WHUMP of an enemy exploding is musical. The sheer panic in my first game when hearing a missile lock coming my way. It's good, that's what I think.\n\nThe gameplay is... Okay, I wanna say 100% good, like the others, but there are a few niggles. Collision models are a bit off from ship models, so you'll find yourself bumping into things you think you wouldn't if you try to cut really close to objects. Especially the stations, those things have tons of little nooks and crannies to hide in.\n\nThe map is pretty decent, though it's a space game. There's space. It's space. not much to look at : / But it provides cover and tactical options like any moba. Plenty of opportunities to break line of site and jump away from a bad fight, or hide in ambush or even flanking to take an enemy by surprise that your buddies are already lighting up.\n\nSo far, I havne't found any issues with balance. There are definitely counters, and strong ones, that completely annihilate their counter. Reapers completely destroy Collosi. Brawlers Destroy INterceptors, etc. I haven't gotten to play all the ships, but I have plaeyd against all of them. FYI, stealth ships suck, the backstabbing pieces of ♥♥♥♥ XD And repair ships like the Protector are OP when paired with a Collosus, Gladiator or Leviathan. So long as you protect them, ironically.\n\nAnd now, the part where people are taking Umbridge, the Monetization.\n\nYeah, it's there. No, it's not a big deal. Buy boosters if you want, they double your income. You get free drop-pods (Little goodie backs that give you stuff) every day. So far, the Crews are the only thing that come from those exclusively, but I got a decent crew right off the bat and there aren't very many crew to choose from and their bonuses vary only slightly. Think of them as runes and masteries from League, only less important; They buff you a bit in the early game, but they don't give you an edge that can't be overcome by skill. The premium ships are purely cosmetic (aside from unlocking them instantly, you get nothing special and, in my opinion, they're ugly and make you a big glowy target.) Other things, like the founder packs, grant you a limited number of goodies, but above all a stacking buff to EXP and Credits that counts for every person in the match. And that's the extent of the monetization.\n\nThe other half of this that gets mentioned is the GRIND. There is a small grind (think CoD4 or Bad Company 2), but if you're enjoying the game, you won't notice it. It's that small. You can unlock most of the early ships, one of every class, within 10-20 games. More kills/captures/supports means more credits/exp.\n\nWhich reminds me of my favorite aspect of this game: You get rewarded for supporting just like kills. That's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. Support points grant you exp and credits and count towards your MMR, so being a support main is viable. A good protector can tip the balance in a fight, easily. So, if you're having trouble winning and aren't getting a lot of kill, switch the a Protector and keep your buddies alive. Attach yourself to a Collosus and carry them to kills.\n\nFirst and foremost, this is a game of tactics and positioning. If you aren't careful with where you move and when you jump, you'll get completely shut out by more experienced players. Even jumping while pointing the wrong direction can get you killed or waste precious minutes as your lumbering ship turns around. Oh yeah, Jumping preserves your Vector (direction and velocity). Think portals and you'll be fine (Speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out.).\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nIt's a good game. For an Alpha, it's incredible well optimized and will run on a potato. Servers are great (Rarely top 120ms even on europe servers.) The only downside is the lack of players. Off-peak hours it can take more than 5 minutes to find a game. On-peak, it's more like 1-2 minutes, which is on par with almost every moba.\n\nAnd, as with all moba's, remember to be friendly. So many new players get turned away because they get flamed by more experienced players. Teach them, help them and they'll learn and help this game stay strong.\n\n\n\n","May 27","true","33.5"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","24","29","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecoldzephyr/recommended/310380/","thecoldzephyr","thecoldzephyr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecoldzephyr/","41 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNow that Fractured Space has gone free-to-play, I figured I should put in my two cents on why it's worth getting into. FS is the first "MOBA" I've ever really gotten into, so this review should be taken with that in mind, and while I have decent previous experience with the game, I've only started getting back into it recently as of this writing.\n\nFirst, I put MOBA in quotes above because FS plays with many conventions typical of the genre, if not outright breaking them. To enumerate a few:\n1. No minions or destructible towers\n2. Three lanes, but one of them is less important in the early game and a potential tide-turner later on\n3. No creeps: resources for leveling up come primarily from capturing and holding mining stations and secondarily from player kills.\n\nNext, I think the one aspect unrelated to the MOBA genre that sets FS apart from other games is three-dimensionality. Ships can freely move in the X, Y, and Z axis, and you would be foolish not to take advantage of this, because three-dimensional combat is enforced by:\n1. Giving many ships different amounts of armor on different sections\n2. Giving many ships different preferable angles of attack, such as broadside or head-on\n3. Having ships turn at varying speeds to present the best armor or number of guns\n\nSo, what else is there to like about this game? Well, several things:\n1. A small but generally friendly and supportive community\n2. Active devs who listen to player feedback and respond appropriately and promptly\n3. A good selection of unique ships, most of them viable\n4. The game is free-to-play, not pay-to-win; some advanced ships can be bought with real money, but they are statistically identical to their normal counterparts\n5. Teamwork is vital to success, and a victory earned through working together is incredibly satisfying\n\nHowever, much as I love this game, there are some things that could be improved on or are simply lacking:\n1. Wait-times for matchmaking can range from 2-5 minutes plus the possibility of having to restart matchmaking if both teams can't be filled, and while the devs have stated this is being worked on, at least one aspect they can't forcibly change is-\n2. -Low player population. I've seen the number of players online slide between 300 and 500 on a weekday, and with each match taking 20-25 minutes average, the number of people actually looking for a match at any given time is going to be low. While this means you can repeatedly be grouped with the same competent, friendly players, the opposite is also true\n3. Teamwork is so vital to success that if one player disconnects or decides to do their own thing, the team they're on is pretty safely doomed - definitely try to group up with friends *and* communicate with your entire team\n4. The system for acquiring new crew is a major grind, especially for new players who don't get all their original crew gifted to them, and while this isn't insurmountable, it is telling that buying crew with real money is rather prominently promoted\n5. The game takes a commitment in time, especially with the new daily missions which give rewards for completing 2, 4, and 6 matches a day, which is a large obstacle for people who might have an hour or less to play per day and is made worse by the aforementioned problems with matchmaking\n6. As should be expected for a game that is both in Early Access and features a large selection of ships, some ships and combinations are simply superior when skill levels are similar, the main example being the Colossus, which is by far the best defensive ship due to its health, damage output and crowd control abilities\n7. The pace of the game may be slower and more tactical than what some players may be interested in\n8. A small complaint, but the inability to freely pitch or roll your ships feels like it limits some of the fun that could be had with the game\n\nDespite that list of negatives though, I still highly recommend Fractured Space to players looking for a unique MOBA-esque experience featuring space combat in large ships.\n\nFinally, if you do decide to play, here's probably the most important tip to help new players:\nCapture the mining stations. Unless you're using a frail ship meant for sniping, assassination, or healing your team, take every opportunity to capture mining stations that you can, and even if you are using those ships, you can still capture mining stations when it doesn't get in the way of fulfilling those duties.","May 26","true","84.5"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hypergrip/recommended/310380/","hypergrip","Hypergrip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hypergrip/","218 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDisclaimer: This is an EARLY ACCESS review. The points listed in this review may be subject to change. This review is intended to help you decide if you want to put some money down to get alpha/beta access to this game.\n\nGameplay OverviewThe goal in Fractured Space is to capture the enemy base while preventing the enemy team from capturing yours. To do that players choose from a selection of large capital ships (as I write this there are currently 6 types available, more are planned) with different weapons and abilities. The map is divided into several sectors containing star bases, mining stations, etc. for the players to capture. Captured mining bases generate resources for the team that can be used to upgrade your ship. Once a team has upgraded their ships, they can try and take over the enemy base.\n\nHow does the Combat feel?The 6 ship types currently in the game offer some nice variety in the way you engage your enemy. We have a "Sniper" type ship with a limited firing arc that can charge up shots and do massive damage over large distances. The "Flagship" can take a lot of hits and pack quite a punch, but its guns have a very limited range. The "Hunter" is relatively fast (they still are capital ships and feel quite massive when steering) and can blink (short-range teleport) to get into or out of fights, but is quite squishy. The "Assassin" is even more squishy, but has the ability to cloak and lower the enemy defenses before unloading a salvo of missles into the unsuspecting target. With the "Disruptor" there is also a ship type that fits more into the classic "support" role with its ability to repair itself or friendly ships, and disable enemy ships weapons for a shot period.\n\nThe weapons range from (almost-)instant hit laser beams to slow moving projectiles, depending on your ship type. With the different weapon ranges, firing arcs, and turret placement Fractured Space is as much about positioning and manouvering as it is about aiming. A ship with 4 turrets on the top side and 2 on the bottom side will try to get beneath the enemy, a "Sniper" will try to stay at a distance so the enemy can't return fire. Smaller ships can try and flank the "Sniper" so (because its firing arc is very limited) it can't fight back. You will see ships circling each other duking it out in close combat, as well as ships playing hide and seeks using the asteroids and star bases for cover. The latest iteraton of the sector maps encourage more "vertical" gameplay, and planned changes to the sector jump mechanic could also promote more flanking.\n\nOne thing that can really hamper your enjoyment of the combat is low fps that has been reported by several players, even some with higher end machines. The developers have stated that optimization is one of the priorities right now, and that they are looking into other problems that might cause low framerates. You might also find that your weapons/abilities do not fire, do fire but don't seem to do any damage, hit some invisible wall instead of the target, etc.\nThe game is in early development.\nThere are lots of bugs.\nYou might get low fps.\nYou might even not be able to start the game at all because it keeps crashing.\nThe devs are making improvements and fixing bugs, but your particular problem might take a while.\nIf you can't accept that, this Early Access title is not for you, please save yourself the frustration and wait for the final release.\n\nCurrent Features -vs- Planned FeaturesThe current version (as of this writing) of Fractured Space has a couple of ships, decent combat and a very basic resrouce and upgrade system. There is a LOT still missing in this game that has the potential to add stretegic and tactical depth to this game. Let's highlight some things.\n\n(Note: all those thigns are tings that are somewhere on the developers' whishlist, Most of these points are based on the devs posting things like "yeah, actually that's pretty close to the concept we have discussed for this" on the forums, or discussing these things with the players during one of the playtests. WHile it's likely we will see those features at some point and in some variation, there is NO GUARANTEE for that, as development moves on!)\n\nShip Selection: There are currently 6 playable ship types in the game that allow for varied play styles. There are several more ships planned, including (according to forum and mumble discussions with the devs) a Carrier and a ship that is focused on movement.\n\nUpgrade System: Currently the upgrade system consists of flat stat boosts to your ship, making it a bit harder, better, faster, stronger. Plans for an upgrade system include players being able to chose different upgrade to adjust to the situation better.\n\nMatchmaking & Social Features: There is currently no matchmaking system in the game. Players join a server, when the server is full (or all players ready up) the match begins. You currently are assigned a team randomly, so playing with friends can be a bit tricky, too. The developers have talked about a lobby where players could chat and select their ship before starting the match. Automatic Matchmaking (for solo players as well as groups) is planned for later down the road, possibly utilizing third party technology. The ability to form Groups and Clans has been discussed by the developers and is planned, but not with high priority.\n\nPlayer progression: While you earn some XP for matches currently, there is no player progression in the game yet. There are plans for players to unlock different ship types, ship system, and crew members with the earned XP. The ship systems are planned to be sidegrades that emphasize certain aspects of the ship while toning down others, or make different playstyles more viable. The developers have stated that a player with a fully unlocked tech tree should have some more options, but not flat out more power than a player that just started.\n\nDeveloper InteractionWhen a game is released as Early Access one of the points listed is usually "allowing players to become part of the development process". Edge Case Games claims to follow an "Open Development ethic", and from my experience since the pre-Early Access playtests have been very positive in this regard. The developers frequent the forums are partake in the discussions, react to feedback, throw around ideas, etc. We've seen quite some player feedback implemented in this early stage and I expect this to continue down the road. You can also often find some of the developers on the official Mumble server (especially during the irregular playtests) where they engage in friendly discussion with the players. There is also a public bug tracker where players can report the bugs they found and can see what issues the team is currently working on. With many of the core mechanics (like the upgrade system) still being in an early testing or even planning phase, the influence of the community on the direction this game takes is definitly there.\n\nSo... should I buy Fractured Space in Early Access?If you've read this far I think it's safe to say that you at least were somewhat interested in the theme of the game. If you expect all those nice ideas and concepts fully fleshed out in a bug-free game however, then no, you should not buy early Access for this game (basically you should not buy Early Access for ANY game). If you liked the ideas behind this game and want to help test and shape this game, and have some bucks to spare, then sure, go for it. I've had quite some fun with it so far (and my fair share of bugs and crashes, too), and I think there is a lot of potential.\n\n","November 24, 2014","true","661.3"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

Seems like pretty much all the negative reviews recently are due to the fact that some people can't be bothered to read what they buy. They paid for alpha access before others and gain various benefits even now, but apparently they should get their money back now that it's open for all when this game was always supposed to be free to play. Which apparently was clearly stated on store page when they paid for it too.\n\nThe game seems pretty polished for early access, and mostly seems to be lacking in tech tree and perhaps different maps/game modes, but that's to be expected at this point. The game mode in this is mobaish two-lane push to win tug of war where you try capture recource zones in order to gain levels, and prevent enemy from leveling. In the middle of the map there is an shared objective called gamma which comes online for contest every few minutes and give general buff for the whole team to pretty much every stat and every subsequent buff gets stronger. The main objective, as usual, is the destruction of enemy home base.\n\nI have only scratched the surface, but the game feel pretty tactical and the ships seem quite balanced and have some paper/rock/scissors mechanics to them. You have to keep an eye out for overall situation on both lanes and for gamma objective, and warp around the map as situation calls for it. It's a mighty feeling to warp in middle of a big fight at just the right time to turn around otherwise losing battle to your teams advantage and then take an important objective or even win the game afterwards as a result of your timely arrival on scene.\n\nThe "grind" is gathering experience with different manufacturer ships and then unlocking ships how every you like. You may need to unlock some ship before the one you want if they are in a same development line. The ships aren't tiered so they should be all equal in overall strength. Although some ships require more exp and credits to get than others. Different ships mostly have different stats, specialisations, accessories(skills) and playstyles so there is no hurry to open anything in regards of gaining more powerful ships, it's more of finding a ship to suit your playstyle and your team composition.\n\nOverall this game has been a very positive surprise. I barely installed this because of the mixed reviews(because I've come to expect that mixed/negative reviews on f2p usually mean p2w which isnt the case here at all) so I feel that I must recommend this to anyone who might be put off by the mixed reviews of reading impaired petty people too. The game is solid and free so give it a try. It may or may not be your cup of tea, but in my opition this is good for what it is.\n\nSeems to me like "new" genre or subgenre games many times come in a pair of "the arcade" and "the more cerebral" one. Like in case of mech games hawken and mechwarrior online, in tank games WoT and WT etc. This seems to be the latter with dreadnought being the more arcade version. Both still are in early stages still and I for one eagerly await the development of both.\n","June 2","true","14.3"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","2"

It still has "enough twitch"-aspect so the player skill plays a major role. A single skilled player can somewhat dominate the game as there aren't many "instant hit" weapons that you couldn't avoid with proper movement and positioning. The few lasers in the game are pretty limited in effective range. Some of the weapons also have firing arcs, which means that if you aren't positioned well, you might be only to fire eg. one out of four main weapons.\n\n+Looks and specially SOUNDS suberb\n+Not just a hitscan shooter, moving plays a HUGE role.

It's a very playable alpha, granted, but there's still a lot of very basic features missing.\n\nThe good:\n+Ships feel different and handle like capital ships of great size.\n+Abilities and placement are important.\n+Crew setup, upgrades and team comp feels important and has a lot of depth.\n+Games are long, but always feel rewarding.\n+Ships look great and the graphics are overall pretty good.\n\nThe bad:\n-Some very basic things are missing like filtering for servers and the options to make a party.\n-The UI presentation is confusing and is a little too minimal, there's a lot of information that's easy to miss.\n-Expect ships and abilities to be over/under-powered. I personally had a lot of trouble with the Sniper ships, as of right now.\n-Very few players, except during free weekends.\n-You have to grind to unlock new abilities and ships, unless you buy in-game currency.\n-The music is quite lackluster.\n\nBottom Line:\nIf you're itching to step onto the bridge and command your own ship into battle then Fractured Space will certainly scratch that spot, but bear in mind that it's still alpha and the game still needs more work.\n\nOctober 2015 update:\nThe game just got a huge update which has vastly improved the crew mechanics and seems to have balanced out the different ships far more. Snipers seem to have been reworked, thank god. Furthermore, we have a new game mode that is shorter and more action packed, but it is possible to base rush which can lead to some games feeling cheesy. I would still make this a cautious recommendation, but with the knowledge that the game is improving.\n\nNovember 2015 update:\nAnother big update just released and with it a much needed 2 part tutorial to help new players learn the basics of the game. You can now also freely choose between the two game modes. For the next update I would love to see more options for the ship abilities and more new crew to choose from, especially a Gunnery Technician that could increase your turret turn rate.\n\nJanuary 2016 update:\nMatchmaking has been released and it's now possible to party up, before searching for a match, however it's only possible to party up with one friend so far. The tech tree has been reworked and so has the tutorial. The 30 % faster respawn time granted to teams with a disconnected player is not enough and should include a minor stat buff. Finally, for the next update I would really like to see more crew and more loadout options for the existing ships.","September 27, 2015","true","36.5"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","0"

Obviously the gamestate lacks divertity in gameplay and strategy but I plan on closely watching the development. Additional maps and further loadout customization will result in a dynamic game with great replayability.\n\nMy only complaint is games tend to take a long time, often 30+ minutes for a single round, much of this is moving into position rather than actually engaging. This might be due to my preference for playing heavy defense ships to tank for the team. Coordionation is crucial to success, and having even one teammate drop out leads to a huge difference in team strength especially in do or die moments.\n\nAs of now the game lacks proper matchmaking and established teamplay, but from what I read thats down the pipeline.\n\nFinal recommedation - give it a try, play a few rounds.

It's got solid mechanics, different kinds of ships with different playstyles and strengths, progression trees for unlocking new ships/guns/equipment (however some are still being built so many ships currently only have one loadout). It does a decent job at filling that void we all wanted EVE Online to fill: piloting massive ships in firey combat against one another without just point-and-click, RTS-like combat. Although while the ships are huge in reality, the controls and the absence of tons of smaller ships does kinda make the scale feel a bit smaller.\n\nBut yeah, this tends to be the game I keep coming back to when I get bored with Elite Dangerous or my other space games. There are around 20+ ships, so even though I've played the crap out of this and I have everything unlocked, I still always have fun by just playing a different ship every game or so. Small base of constant players, but definitely enough to always get into a game without sitting in warm up for too long. Noobs welcome too! The community is pretty supportive and most people will answer every one of your questions in game. ABSOLUTELY worth $10 to everyone (including non-space-fanatics).

In the time it took for me to unlock a tier 2 relativly cheap ship the brawler i could have pre tech tree update unlocked at least 2-3 ships. The grind is now incredibly long. Although the Xp grind isnt too bad the credit grind sucks (Ships must be unlocked with manufacturer specific XP and then bought with general currency). For me the grind has been a major turn off for the game. Also as part of the tech tree update my previous ships were all reset so i have to grind ships now.\n\nPros:\nGameplay is really solid. Capital ships feel slow and heavy like they should more games really should do this style of gameplay. Ships also feel unique like MOBA heroes each with specific roles and playstyles.\nGraphics the graphics are pretty good the ships for the most part look really good with each of the 3 manufacturers(Think countries in War thunder or WOT) having a specific style of ship design e.g. The Zarek have got a boxy design continued through there ships. However the environment could do with work aside from the bases which are massivly improved now.\nVariety. Theres a lot of variety in ships theres over 20 ships in game now i think. Each one plays differently and has unique abilites. Some include the basiliks black hole. Or the Leviathans fusion  beam. Whilst other abilites carry over to other ships e.g. Missiles and strike craft are seen on a lot of ships. Also whilst there are several cloaking ships (Assasins e.g. Infiltrator, Ghost, Basilisk) Each one plays differently with the basilisk being a support ship in comparison to the offensive styles of the others.\n\nCons:\nGrind. Its pretty ridiculous imo. XP grind comes first and is over pretty quick. Then you need the credits and say youre grinding your first ship you will often find yourself with all the XP and half of the credits meaning youre now grinding a 2nd ship to afford the next which means by the time you have the XP for the 2nd youre massivly behind in creds. Some ships are also outrageously exspensive. Also anyone wanting to play a cloaker now has to wait an age and the easiest to get is the basilisk and the Widow one of which sucks as its too easy to counter and the other is good but doesnt really play much like an assasin. Also the grind forces you into playing certain ships repeatedly e.g. When i was grinding for the brawler i only had the pioneer starting USR ship which i hated to begin with. Now i am grinding for the basilisk and i would be forced into playing the sentinel which is a ship i hate due to my hatred of autoaim guns. Also its just boring for me. Fortunatly i have the revenant a limited time ship given away a while ago so i at least have got a good ship to play in that tree but repeatedly playing it still bores me\nShip designs. Imo the ships vary from being really awesome e.g. Colossus to being fairly lackluster the new superlifter looks like a box. As does the gladiator. Or the interceptor which looks spookily similar to a reaper or paladin. I get manufacturer ships should look similar but a bit more variety is nice.\n\nOf note a lot of people complain about the paragon (Carrier) being removed i dont really mind the ship was a major irritation when it was around had too much health imo and didnt really acomplish all that much. But my opinion on it is if the devs felt it shouldnt be in the game thats there decision and i agree with them it wasnt working and wasnt functioning as a carrier should but i look forward to a future one.\n\nAgain to sum up its a cautious recommend if you like battlestar galactica or various other sci-fi stuff then this is pretty awesome but if you have a job and dont want another then the grind might be too much for you.","May 21, 2015","true","50.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

Content in menu is so far very limited, but game is capable of being played and provides excellent audiovisual experience.\n\nAlso, I have to say, that guns do have sound effects according to their nature, strong canon shows "recoil" sound efffect. I know, there is the vacuum in the space, but it is very important for players to feel the power of the weapon and this is present here. Strategy is a key for winning  and community is good so far.\n\nThere has been a wipe to set everyone equal starting conditions after bringing economics to the game. You have to earn reputations with manufacturers and unlock new ships and loadouts, I rate this as positive feature, which is still being evaluated and getting better.\n\nFree weekend had a great impact on community grow and new players are seeking for new stratiegies with a help of veteran players. Also in-game shop emerged, content will be released soon. These changes increased requirements for the servers, so you can expect some engine glitches and a need of lower resolution, but this is only a temporary issue. Also be preparde for increased effort to play together, because servers are filling fast and team matchmaking is to be implemented soon.\n\nAlso, teamplay is now crucial for the victory and even with basic loadout you can do pretty messy things. But forget about one single overpowered ship. Good combination can beat anything, solo ships are sentenced to be easily neutralized.\n\nI recommend this for everyone, who had ever desired to command his own ship and lead it to a furious battle.\n\nNote, that this is an Early Access Game. Be ready for bugs and features in development, creators are eager to discuss and implement it in patches. If you are not willing to contribute in developing the game, better wait for full release.","February 19, 2015","true","130.0"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

I've always loved space shooters, but I got tired of saving the galaxy in a starfighter. Capital ship combat is where my heart is.\nThe game at this point consists of 5v5 rounds that generally last from 10-25 minutes. There is a decent variety of ships to choose, but they must be unlocked with experience. Despite other reviews, I don't think it takes overly long to unlock the various ships (I'm up to 10 or so at 30hrs). Subjectively, I'm unlocking ships on here faster than I'm unlocking tanks of WoT. I'm having fun unlocking ships, and it doesn't feel like a grind to me. There are multiple classes of ships to support multiple playstyles, and the dev's seem good about balancing and re-balancing during this stage. Despite the fact that the ships don't maneuver as fast as in starfighter type games, the game still has a speedy pace. The direction of battle can shift wildly at a moments notice. You can be on the verge of losing one moment, then snatch victory from the jaws of death with great teamwork.\n\nI love it. Sure, there are problems, but this game is still in testing. I like the direction that the game devs are taking it, and they are constantly working on it.\n\nPros:\nBeautiful graphics.\nFun 5v5 combat.\nVariety of ships.\nGame is well optimized for online play. I rarely experience lag issues at server end.\n\nCons: **remember, this is early access**\nSmall playerbase means you generally wait 3 minutes for a match\nMatchmaker needs work.\nCurrently no provision to join a match in progress. This sucks because sometimes you get an idle/AFK/disconnected player in the match that needs to be replaced.","May 19","true","41.0"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

For the moment this isn't much of a bother because the population is terribly low, but hopefully with more time and success they will improve on this so it's easier to go from match to match without seeing the same players over and over.\n\nI highly recommend this game to gaming clans, for the low price of $20 USD per 5 pack it is very much worth it if you have other players in mind to bring with you into the game.  For the base price of $10 USD for one, it isn't worth it yet until the population problems are smoothed out and gameplay is more regular.  That said, when things pick up, this will certainly be a game worth $15 USD per purchase.\n\nI have had a short but sweet experience with it and sincerely hope to see it succeed, as I would like to continue playing it even when my clanmates are offline.","January 16, 2015","true","2.0"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

Common, a Moba space game where you fly around in Captial Ships? Doesn't sound that appealing to a non-fan of capital ship fighting. All I can usually think about is sitting their firing at another ship for 10mins, untill someones shields finally go down, and then you got 5 more mins of Hull to tear through.\n\nWell, let me say, this is nothing like that at all. This game gave me one of the best outcomes of an early access game I've seen in awhile. The mechanics are all there, with plenty of movement room for expanding.\n\nThe game is alot more fast passed then one would initially think. And on top of it, each ship class is incredibly unique in their play style.\n\nAlthough there is no player progression yet, it is definitely setup to be very successful.\nThe tech trees are alot like World of tanks. However the gameplay is alot like a Moba, but without the boring minion farming. Your team levels up together, and no single person is ever overpowered or ahead in dmg or health. And on top of that, the currect ships are very balanced. None seem to be overpowered.\n\nFrom the looks of it, in the near future, your crew will sort of act like passive stats added to your ships, and then with the tech tree you can switch out your skills for ones that more suit your play style.\n\nExtremely excited to see what is to come with this game.\n\nDate of rating: 01/02/2015\n9/10 - Gameplay\n10/10 - Audio/Voice Overs\n9/10 - Mechanics\n4/10 - Progression (at the moment the tech tree looks sound, however it is not yet fully implemented due to earlyaccess)\n\nOverall Rating - 8/10  ...The current gameplay is very fun, and does not get old.

This game is a mix of dota 2/league of legends and world of tanks. The reason its like dota 2/league of legends is because of the 2 lanes and the primary capture point in the middle that only becomes available at 8 minutes. It like world of tanks but with space ships. You have different types of ships that have different roles: The snipe is good at long range with low health and the Flag ships excels at shot range due to its flak cannons and high health.\n\nWe need a bigger community and I can tell that this game is going to go a long way in the future as it is not another ripe off league of legends or another call of duty.

It's a good game, it's fun, it has a good community and good Development team. It may have some issues but they should be fixed sorta soonish.\n\nI am long overdue for writing a review to this game clearly as indicated by my hours played. I'm not very good a objective reviews but I'm going to try my hardest to do so.\n\nSo Fractured Space is a free to play game about big old capital ships duking it out in a 5v5 situation. It has amazing visual and audio effects for all ships, though I will admit some are more fitting than others. The gameplay is extremely compelling and involved and you really have to do your research if you want to get good at it. This game is not for the faint of heart or the ones that easily give up. It's a very hard game at the start and can be very punishing. Each ship you can play feels unique and perfectly distinguishable both visually and in a gameplay sense. The game also has a great community behind it and i've made many good friends playing it.\n\nThe major negatives I can think of are all mostly excused by the fact that this game is still in development but that doesn't mean it shouldn't affect your decision. The game has a lot of minor glitches and bugs, most of them don't make the game unplayable but for the nitpickers it can be a little irritating. The game is also really not optimized so those with potatoes for computer might not have a lot of luck with this game. I hear a lot of complaining about the servers from others but I have fine responsiveness and performance from them despite having an average of 200 ping. The game is also currently not in an amazing state of balance in terms of the ships themselves but Edgecase (the makers of the game) is not currently invested in ship balance because they are focused on putting all the systems in place before they are 100% functional. Balance is still on going but it isn't a priority for them.\n\nOn the side of more good things I can say that this game is genuinely a bundle of fun. It rewards the skillful and encourages teamwork. It's very tactical and really drives you to think about every action you take. The map is separated in to five sectors that you have to use a jump drive to access. The game is also filled with a variety of brilliantly designed and voiced crew members that provide bonuses to your ship. Something else to note is that the developers are very responsive to player feedback on the forums. They read almost everything even though you might not think it.\n\nI apologize if this review feels a little jumpy and all over the place, i'm not good at structured writing. The big thing I want you to take away from this review is that the game is a ton of fun and while it may have some problems, they will most likely be fixed in the near future.","May 28","true","888.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Buy game - play for ~10 hours - go back to playing CS:GO, TF2 or whatever your particular gaming staples are. For myself, however,  Fractured Space  breaks this cycle, and has becoming an instant favourite. It just doesnt get boring. Even though in its current Alpha state there is only one map and gametype, no two games are ever the same. Maybe you'll be fighting a pitched battle for a space station and get overrun, your ship erupting in a shower of flame and flying debris, or possibly a friendly will jump in at the last second and repair your crippled hull, thrusting you back into the melee. There is also plenty of ships to suit all playstyles - go big, dumb and loud with the Brawler or Flagship and wreak havoc, or take the cloak and dagger approach with the Infiltrator or Assassin. Whatever your playstyle, for fans of the MOBA genre or multiplayer in general,  Fractured Space  is not one to be missed.","June 13, 2015","true","271.9"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

This is not the type of moba for the faint heart. It requires complete teamwork and all ships are balanced.\n\nThere are some players who thought that they needed to unlock higher tier ships in order to become stronger and this is wrong. Higher tier ships are balanced vs tier-1 ships. The only difference is that higher tier ships requires higher knowledge of the game in order for you to fully unlock the ship's potential.\n\nI have played with one player in a queue who cursed one of the final tier ships saying that it was too weak when in fact that ship can actually deal a great amount of damage from a distance. He was using the ship in close combat.\n\nFor new players who wanted to learn more about the ships and its unique abilities, there are community guides available in the forums to assist you.

The starter ships are also pretty decent and I still use them on occasion.\nNot being able to party up with all your friends kinda sucks, but I understand the reasoning of not wanting 5 man slamdowns of 5 people paired up who can communicate and such.\n\nThe game is fun in and of itself, I wish the ships felt bigger though. They move too fast and just seem like oversized toys to me, which is no fault of the models, they're gorgeous, it just seems like toys fighting each other sometimes. More small stuff for scale would be nice I suppose (more visible machineguns for point defense, more fighters, etc).\n\nBut really, when you're in a full team battle to the end for gamma or a home base and all the ships are close together slogging it out, it's a damn fun game and I highly recommend it, especially now that it's free.\n\nI've only encountered one or two squeakers and most of the time everyone is nice and happy to help, so the community, while a bit small at the moment (although I've never had the egregious match finding time problems others report, perhaps it's because I'm in the US East?

I love capital ships in games, and this game doesn't disappoint.  Some have compared it to a MOBA, but its more like a team-based shooter like TF in space.  Once I got the controls down, gameplay was pretty smooth, and the strategies and tactics started becoming apparent.\n\nPros:  Gameplay is very fun, there's a TON of potential here.  With care, it could become a real hit.   Battlefield "terrain" (asteroids) was actually very useful for me for the first time in a space game, ducking and rushing from cover to cover.  Good teamwork leads to victory; smaller ships are useful too (I just helped win a game in a frigate because I could run and hide, eventually rushing in to cap the enemy base.)  Doesn't seem pay-to-win...yet.  Games are relatively quick but deep, they seem to have hit a sweet spot as far as game length goes.\n\nCons: Only 5v5?  C'mon, lets have 10v10 or more - the EPIC space battles that would result would be amazing.  Really small ships like the corvette are useless; they're so fragile that in a 5v5 game, even though they have some healing powers and team buffers, they die so fast that they're not worth taking.  But in bigger games, smaller ships like the corvette could become a real asset, as the more targets increase their chances of survivability.  With so few ships on a side, it seems like ships like the Hunter and Sniper are especially powerful.\n\nIn the end, it boils down to the question - "Am I having fun?"  In short, yes.  I'm an older gamer and have played a lot of space games over the years.  Some were great, some were frustrating and some were just awful.  This one is a very fun game that I hope will get better as they move on to beta and beyond.","January 29, 2015","true","4.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

For one the sniper ship needs a a little more range to it but otherwise seems very balanced. The starting flagship feels wrong, it needs more armor bt otherwise nicely done. From what else I've seen everything else is decently balanced just needs a couple tune ups. The tech tree is structured fine. The loadout section is interesting but the armament upgrades need to offer more. Like a rocket upgrade should change your volley to 10 instead of 8. Diversity is key in this game. If you have diversity in ship types your set and should have no problem winning against a less diverse team. Maybe add a more defined pre-game ship selection and show how many of each ship is on the field so that all roles can be filled. Everything else looks good and it's a wonderful game for alpha.

Every battle is unique and awesome in it's own way. The effects and explosions and lasers look awesome and make the battles feel real.

Sadly lacking currently in the player population department as well but I haven't had too much difficulty finding a game.\n\nGameplay is fairly slow and methodical, but in my opinion manages to capture this certain 'visceral' feel with impressive visuals and sound design. Ships feel very hefty and powerful.\n\nIn it's current state (as of the time of writing), there are 6 ships (with a small amount of customisation) and one map/game mode (the aforementioned standard MOBA type game mode). It's a small start, but the things that are already there are promising.\n\nI've heard of others complaining about poor optimisation and sudden framerate drops but I have yet to experience anything of the sort. It may be worth looking into though if you are on a lower end system.\n\nFor the $10 asking price, I'm happy with the product, especially considering the prospect of more maps, game modes and features in the future. This is the foundation of a game (in early alpha), and unlike some other early access titles I've played it's a very solid one.

Handling a small fast ship is very different from piloting one of the huge lumbering beasts that are also available.\nGames are fun and engaging, especially when the special Gas facility opens up every few minutes and the usual fight over the 2 flanking sectors makes way for a single big battle for control of this precious resource.\n\nThe bad:With important information scattered over different places, the game takes some time to get into.\nIt can take quite a while before you'll be able to unlock the more specialized ships. The more specialized the ship, the more expensive it is to unlock.\n\n\nFrom what I understand, since the free weekend, Fractured Space has seen a huge increase in its player population, resulting in new games being filled up quite rapidly leading to few games which are not 5Vs5.\n\nSince it is still in Alpha, the game does take a bit of effort to get into but once on the main screen you will find an overview of what goes on during a match as well the goal along with the controls for the game.\n\nWith currently 12 different ships to pick from, there is something for just about anyone. Whether you want to dish it out up close and personal, attack from afar or lend support in different ways to your allies, there is a ship for you. Even individual ships can be tweaked in small ways, by changing their load-out. This is also where you will find a more detailed description on each of your ship's systems, including their effective range (this was perhaps the biggest issue I had when starting my first match and had little idea of when my target was within weapons range).\n\n\ntl;dr\nGreat 5Vs5 moba where you take control of capital spaceships that takes some time to get into.","April 25, 2015","true","643.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The objective is to capture the enemy home base. The map is split into five areas, each with their own bits for capping.\n\nThe first two are the team's home bases. These areas contain the home station (the win condition) and two mini-stations (I generally call these nodes to keep things clear).\nThe next two are the two main arena areas, Alpha and Beta. Each area contains two warp points (these are needed to be capped to jump into the enemy base) and three nodes, as well as asteroid based cover.\n\nLastly we have Gamma which is bang in the middle. It is warpable to from any area, but you can only jump to A/B warp points from there. There is only one structure here, the gas station, which is only cappable periodically. Capping it gives your fleet a huge boost to damage and recharge rates for about 2 minutes (or till death if they die before that time expires). Each time the station becomes available for capping, the bonus will be greater than the last.\n\nGames are always 5v5. You enter the match with a pre-selected ship, however during warm-up or first entry, you can choose a different ship to better suit you team build. But once your ship is selected, that's it until the match is over.\n\n:Mechanics:\nCapping: Points are capped by entering their bubble of influence. Capping speed is determined by the amount of ship levels in the bubble versus the amount of opponent ship levels in the bubble (I'll explain levels next). I’m not sure at what multiples you have to be at to cap an area with enemy still in it, but you have to have significantly more levels than they do.\n\nLevels and nodes: Maximum ship level is team wide, and is increased by capping nodes. Nodes generate points when capped, and when the points hit the right amount, your team levels up. You however do not automatically level up. Instead, you have to fly back to a capped warp station or home base. Levels increase damage, health and recharge rates, with each level growing exponentially (e.g. the jump between 5 and 6 will be far greater than 1 and 2).\n\nCombat: The main feature of the game. Every ship has different ranges on it's guns, as well as some having optimal range before damage drop off. Many ships also rely on their facings for their weapons fire arcs. Whilst some ships can fight at any angle, some have to face certain ways to bring guns to bear.\nAnother aspect that is little often discussed is armour. Each ship has 6 different armour facings, being front, back, port, starboard, top, and finally bottom. As a facing gets repeatedly hit, the armour will take damage. Once it has taken enough, it will drop (represented by the facing burning) and any damage taken against that facing will increase.\nAll ships have abilities. This is what defines their tactics and play style with some ships able to generate different kinds of shielding, others have more support weapons, and mother with support drones or fighters/bombers. Each ship has three “class abilities” assigned on the 1, 2, & 3 keys, and “general abilities” on 4, 5, & 6. Your general abilities are Point defence(4), used for intercpeting missiles and hostile drone/attack craft, Warp to(5) for moving between locations, and Warp Home (6) which is a longer warp, but will always warp you to home base no matter the location (unless already home)\n\n:Ships:\nThere are a multitude of ships to play with, each with their own unlocks to change out their equipment. Each ship will fit roughly into one of three categories, Defence, Support and Assault. All of which is pretty self explanatory. Composition of your team can be really important. Focused too much in one aspect can leave you woefully exposed, with certain ships being better on taking on different classes of ships. For example, the Assassin (A “Tier 3” unlock) is fantastic for taking out lighter ships and support ships, but will struggle against heavies and dedicated combat craft.\n\nYou start off with access to three different ships from the three different manufacturers (There is a fourth, but nothing has been released for them so far).\n\nFlagship: One of the two heavies so far released. This is a defensive class ship, mainly due to its ability to tank huge amounts of damage. Despite having a short boost ability, it is very slow and with guns that are really focused on close range, it can feel really cumbersome.\n\nHunter: This is your first assault ship. It's nimble, it's guns are some what close range, and it has to be careful with it's facing. It can do micro-jumps to get it in range, can fire missiles for longer range and can detect nearby hidden ships. It has to keep a forward facing towards it's target or suffer huge DPS drop as it won't be able to bring it's other guns to bare.\n\nCorvette: Your first support ship, and arguably the most useful. It's very light, meaning it's fast, but can't take to much damage. It is a dedicated healer however. It's main gun will have it's shots home towards your locked on enemy, allowing you to focus on your team mates. It's main features are it's repair beam and shield, allowing it to heal and block damage respectively.\n\nMy Summary:\n\nI really do enjoy this game, however, as it's still in alpha, there will be a fair few changes in the future, as well as few bugs. I got it on the free steam weekend, but I would recommend it, even you just get it at it's cheapest price. I look forward to seeing what new features will be made for it. Bugs are currently few and far between, but can be very annoying, even match ruining if you come across one, but they do seem to be fixed pretty sharply. If you wished to hold out until it's more developed, I wouldn't blame you, but as it currently stands, the combat is nice and varied, with plenty of different ship types to keep matches interesting.","April 28, 2015","true","43.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

It is a neet idea, and I think lends itself well to a group strategy and I think the depth of strategy will not be apparent at first. I love how the maps? are laid out and there are multiple ways to conquer the enemy, the only downside is a group that dosnt comm will probly not win against a group that talks, (nothing new). There is some good concepts here and I hope the Devs will follow through and polish this title... it is very close to being very good with some tweeking. I do have one concern however and that is that the game shows the framework for potentially going free to play......","November 24, 2014","true","7.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I love how every ship looks and feels very unique so far and how they all have unique weapons and abilities. There is also a nice tech tree for abilities that allows for players with the same model ship to still be different in that they have upgraded there ship differently or have different crew members operating it. I think allowing players to feel unique is crucial to the success of any game, so i'm glad to see it present in Fractured Space.\n\nI would like to see more ships developed as well as more crew options, there are really only 2 options per position atm. I would also like to see map variations, i think it would be refreshing and would also add an element of planning strategy according to the map. The the strategy in combat is somewhat simplistic and i think this game would greatly benefit if it were 10 v 10 instead. then combat would be more exciting and you would really start to see the benefits of having a combination of "healers", "tanks" and dps ships. The ships move so slowly that once you realize you can't win a fight you're pretty much screwed as those decisions need to be made before even engaging, unless you have blink - which needs to be nerfed, the cooldown is too low. Also, you would have to weigh a much higher risk to pursue a fleeing target if the teams were larger. Currently, most skirmishes are only between 2 and 3 ships because you need to split up to capture and defend sectors so devs please consider increasing the team size.\n\n\n\nAnyway i really see alot of potential for this game to be successful. All it needs is more exposure. You have my support.","March 13, 2015","true","15.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

There are control points on the map and you push from your base to the other base to win.\n\nHowever, the full 3d space enviroment givinf you 6DoF is a really nice touch. Not to mention the nice space sci-fi theme. The ships feel good when they move. They dont always feel fast, sometimes they feel really slugish. In this case, thats a very good thing. These are supposed to be large battle ships. They feel heavy and armored, and armed to the teeth.\n\nI was able to pick this game up and within just one or two matches I knew what was going on and what I was doing. Within that same number of matches, I went from getting my butt handed to me, to winning with really decent K/D ratio. Honestly though I just chock that up to feeling really comfortable with the assassin ship, which is a hit and run cloaker.\n\nI think this game has a lot of potential. I really like the ability to pick the crew for your ship, which so far is cosmetic, but pleasent as all the crew so far are fully voiced so they have battle chatter.\n\nAll in all, the game looks good, it feels good, and it is a lot of fun. The dev is on the right path, and I am very excited to see what comes next.\n\nIt looks like they intend to add many more ships, and the ability to customise your ships equipment and abilities to some degree.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to others. Just keep in mind, it is in Early Access at the time of this review.","November 24, 2014","true","10.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

The combat is immensely satisfying, intense, kills feel good and deaths don’t feel cheap.\n•	The game has a strange, methodically slow pace to it. You are encouraged to think laterally and plan manoeuvres – some may complain about this but I think it is a very good thing.\n•	The verity of ships and different roles they play all feel significant, no one ship ‘feels’ gimped, all have their strengths and weaknesses.\n•	The devs are proven and have a clear plan for development of this title.\nThere are a couple of caveats at the moment though;\n•	The game does not currently support pre-made teams; this will be a problem if you want to play on the same team as your friends.\n•	You will feel the FPS drop on occasion – this is fairly normal for a game in development, optimisation will come with time.\n•	While the core game mechanics are (mostly) done and really quite fun, a lot of the meta – inter-match gameplay and higher level mechanics are currently missing, this makes the game feel incomplete and may be a deal-breaker for many. To those people I’d highly recommend waiting and seeing what happens as development progresses.\n•	Those who don’t like Dota style 5v5 3-lane combat may be put off as the game appears to draw some influence from the likes of Smite.\n","December 13, 2014","true","14.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

I started playing a few months ago and took a break because the game wasn't well balanced at the time. Recently got back into it after a few updates and balancing is much better, with a few exceptions.\nThe game is simple and easy to learn, but with enough differences in ships to give you a large choice in tactics.\nThe graphics are fantastic! The map is simple, but pretty. They could use more maps though, the same one can get rather boring after awhile.\n\nIn short, it's a simply easy to learn game that can be equally as fun and frustrating as any FPS or RTS.\nIt needs more maps, game modes and a much better server joining system, I enjoy playing this game with friends but it isn't easy to make sure were on the same team. Hosting personal games would be nice too. More players another with new maps would be nice as well, currently the game is only at 10 players per round.

You'll find yourself enjoying the simple space combat, timing your shields between cover and the anticipation of that desperately needed missle barage. It's quite a spectacular game to take in: beautiful graphics, the perfect sounds, you can even see the detail of individual turrets and thrusters working as you command your vessel. The issues however, that despite the enjoyable gameplay, its repetitive with little motivation to play frequently.\n\nTo the dev: so far my experience has been a pleasant one, however more often than not, if one side starts to lose everyone jumps ship and leaves just a few players to fend for themselves. If there were credits to spend on customization of say crew or appearance, or maybe even equipment (keep it balanced please) then players might actually stick around. Or perhaps when one side starts to win there could be some sort of balancing feature like faster respawns for the losing team. As it is when one team starts to dominate the field, they're the winners. Also I hope to see more done with the crew slot aspect of the ship other than voices. Perhaps a slow combat regen, faster jumps, faster captures. It would be nice if your tactical leader have more purpose besides base cap as well, capturing an enemy ship perhaps using boarding pods ? Also it would be nice to gear up your ship how you like but they have a 1-2 locked abilities/ weapons + stats including what already exists, but perhaps add in targeting systems that allow for faster turret turning and accuracy increases. Finnally some sort of engine overdrive that isnt the ftl, would greatly increase the gameplay speed and skill involved, not saying make it a fighter jet, but some sort of depletable bar.","November 22, 2014","true","91.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","1"

You got your to expected weapons, utilities and drones to fight against other ships. There are currently three factions with a (yet sparse, some would say) tech tree with different ships to research. The main types also apply in Fractured Space: Offense, Defence and Support with according abilities. (May call them Damage Dealer, Tank and Healer). And even with the currently little pool of ships there are some interesting ways to combine your forces. Also you can form a crew, as you choose five crewmembers out of a bunch with different specifications and thus granting you some bonuses for the ship you can match with your playstyle (sadly there are quite few crewmembers at the time)\n\nWhat i like about FS is the graphic and the design. The three factions have all interesting shipdesigns and i simply adore the modular construction of these giant spaceships. Also the sound is very pleasing. Ignore the fact of soundless space - the lasers ingame are awesome.\n\nOf course you must keep in mind that Fractured Space is a Early Access game and so in state of developement.\nThere is only one map and gamemode aviable right now and you only can invite just one friend to play together.\n\nBut i hope there is more to come.

You got your to expected weapons, utilities and drones to fight against other ships. There are currently three factions with a (yet sparse, some would say) tech tree with different ships to research. The main types also apply in Fractured Space: Offense, Defence and Support with according abilities. (May call them Damage Dealer, Tank and Healer). And even with the currently little pool of ships there are some interesting ways to combine your forces. Also you can form a crew, as you choose five crewmembers out of a bunch with different specifications and thus granting you some bonuses for the ship you can match with your playstyle (sadly there are quite few crewmembers at the time)\n\nWhat i like about FS is the graphic and the design. The three factions have all interesting shipdesigns and i simply adore the modular construction of these giant spaceships. Also the sound is very pleasing. Ignore the fact of soundless space - the lasers ingame are awesome.\n\nOf course you must keep in mind that Fractured Space is a Early Access game and so in state of developement.\nThere is only one map and gamemode aviable right now and you only can invite just one friend to play together.\n\nBut i hope there is more to come. Fractured Space has potential and i hope its gonna play it out right and draw the attention of all who like MOBAs, space and/or capital space ships.\n\n","March 9","true","56.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","0"

I only played two games, but even still, I was able to do something as a starter nooby with nothing. I tried support in my first game and was healing up people in fights and throwing little drones at enemies. We won that one. In the second, I tried an attack ship and got 6 kills (as level 1 vs lvls 6-13). In that sense, it's pretty balanced, I'd say (compared to other games where you join as a new player and get decimated and can do nothing).\n\nWhen I first got on, there were only two servers with players. One had 10/10, the other had 1/10. I was a little discouraged, but I joined the open server anyways and played a game. Afterwards, there were like 6 servers with players and it started growing, which caught me by surprise. I think more people should play this game :P\n\n\nI, for one, plan on playing this more. (Few more details down below)\n\n\n\n\nAs some others have said, it's a team game. I had no idea what I was doing but figured out how to work with others, at least. When I was a little support ship getting hammered by a huge enemy ship, a bigger allied ship came in between us and soaked up the damage. I healed it up and we won against 2 others. In the second game I played, it looked like the whole enemy team didn't care about their team composition and played whatever they wanted. That costed them the win. Our team had a mix of attackers, supports, and a heavy. Theirs? I believe most of them were attack ships and there was maybe 1 heavy.\n\nThey say this when you get in the game, but because it's Alpha, there is no playable tutorial yet. However, they have a little video for you to watch that explains the controls and whatnot. That was enough to get me going at a decent pace. The rest, you learn as you go, I suppose.\n\n\n","September 21, 2015","true","1.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

Giant space vessels clobber each other while trying to take contested space stations to get resources and eventually push the enemy out of their home base. This game sticks to the classic scifi trope that in space everyone is the same way up. Out of battles, the menus are reminiscent of World of Tanks, complete with a crew system, a 'battle button' that instead states "Launch", and the beginings of a tech tree and upgrade system, along with what looks to be the framework of a free to play game. There appear to be be a few different 'classes' of space ship, each with their own abilities, weapons and purpose. I should mention that the game is early access, and does have an 'alpha' feel to it currently, with buggy menus and limited features. If they keep developing this in the right direction it may turn out to be a great game, and I suppose the only way they will manage this will be from the input of their paying 'early accesseers'.\n\nOverall, gameplay is pretty solid, graphics are great (running on the Unreal engine), and there is the tantilising whiff of promise about it which will attract many followers. If it lives up to its potential, and its free to play model is benign (and not pay to win/overpriced), it could well end up being a game to watch out for.","November 21, 2014","true","16.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

It's there for a reason) - there is no ingame help so far and noone's going to hold your hand.\n\nThe mechanics are a bit unusual for a MOBA-style game (capture points instead of destroying them), but after a couple of matches it becomes quite clear.\nThe customization is there, but so far it seems like 'if you bought the upgraded gun you're ahead' (snipers, I mean you!), and is not available for all ship classes.\nThe ships... They are vastly different, as they should be. Can't really talk about balance these days, I've only got ten hours into it, but looks like ship diversity compensates for it rather well.\n\nAll in all, I'm giving it my biased score of 8/10 (why biased?

Graphics are decent, sounds boring, simplistic gameplay, painful control scheme.\n\nGameplay is overly simplistic with far less options than typical fps or moba style games. This is primarily left-click or right-click on a target to shoot and like 1 or 2 very uninspired special attacks. Capturing stations is simply a matter of flying near them as they are all completely undefended. The level up system is also rather simplistic and yields little more than bonus hps and damage. Loadouts are also uninspired with weapon options having little more variety than for example average laser, laser that shoots fast and does lless damage and big laser that shoots slow and does extra damage; nothing that really affects your gameplay in an substantial way.\n\nShips are surprisingly weak for a game that bills itself on capital ship duels which tends to make the game feel very fps-ish. Many battles are over in just a few shots. Many movie/tv battle sequences last longer and they are paying like $1M a minute for cgi. This might be ok for if it was a fighter sim but feels totally wrong in a capital ship context. Also, the respawn timers are far too long making for too much idling. Ship balance is also very poor for an early access game that has been out this long. The support type ships seem generally unplayed and unuseful.\n\nImmersion is very poor due to virtually no consistency in the styling of the various ships. They all look decent but there is little stylistic consistancy like they were just ripped at random from coolspaceships.com or someting. Many of the battles take place at ranges where its difficult to even make out the appearance of the ships so you feel like you are mostly just attacking hitboxes.\n\nCurrently, in Early Access there is only 1 map and once again it is a very uninspired symetrical 2-lane map.\n\nThe only victory condition is to cap your opponents home base. Unfortunately, they made a very dubious design decision in that there is no way to decap your home base meaning that rushing the enemy base is a pretty easy win especially with the short cap time needed and really long respawn timers. Its not unusual to see matches end after simply 1 or 2 clashes not much room for strategy or comebacks.\n\nHopefully the game gets better - there is certainly some potential here.","February 10, 2015","false","7.5"," 57 of 102 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","57","102","0","1"

The biggest issue right now is the final win condition of taking the enemy base. It's a sluggish process and the auto-damage field kinda needs changed to something else like destroyable turrets or something, since even if you've tecnhically won it takes forever to get to the actual win. Otherwise though a good game so far, but like I said I need to play more to reach a full review verdict.","November 20, 2014","true","1.9"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

Unfortunately, the thing I've always loved most about space games is full freedom of movement.  And that's where Fractured Space falls short for me.  The game is actually played as if you are on a flat plane, just like a first-person-shooter game when you're underwater.  You can float upwards or downwards, but your orientation never actually changes.  This means no banking around an asteroid, no complex evasion to shake targetting, and no fun feeling (for me) of being in space.  This game feels far more like a game of submarines than a game of giant space warships.\n\nI can't really recommend Fractured Space, and I doubt the reason for my objection will change as they exit Early Access.  I want something more like Freespace + multiplayer, and I don't think that's a direction the devs plan to go.","April 19, 2015","false","1.4"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

It is a MOBA at heart, but if you don't like traditional MOBAs don't be discouraged. This game is straighforward but manages to be interesting all the same. It is also VERY well balanced, and I will explain what I mean below.\n\nSKILL BASED COMBAT\nThis game is all about skill. The ships all have tradeoffs, so that no ship is truly better than another. Let's take the overseer, a sniper ship with a long range laser gun. It is weak at short range. You would think it would be OP since, space is space and there is a lot of open areas. Wrong. There are many ways to close or combat it, just like any other ship. Bombers, stealth ships, fast agile ships and blink drives all give sniper ships trouble.\n\nShip Classes\nI like to divide the ships into the game into 4 roles:\nCombat Cruisers\n-Medium range ships that take decent beatings and dish out decent damage at , very balanced (ex. Reaper or Venturer)\nDreadnoughts\n-Big slow and heavily armed for short ranged (ex. Colossus or Leviathan)\nDestroyers\n-Fast small ships with varying firepower and interesting abilities[I include stealth ships] (ex. Ghost or Raider)\nSupport Ships\n-All shapes and sizes, these odd ships fill specialty roles that can make a real difference when supporting the damage classes above [snipers are support, not carry] (ex Protector or the Paragon)\n\nSo some people complain about how some ships are good and some suck. This is not the case, it's just they do not have any skills besides brawling and/or straight yolo rushes. Fights are quite nuanced between skilled players. Each ship has it's own playstyle. Most players use a few "meta" ships, which are quite strong and have simple gameplay. These are usually combat cruisers or dreadnoughts. I love using specialty ships and ships with hidden potential to counter cruisers, which make up the bulk of players. I also end up being called a hacking ♥♥♥♥♥♥ a lot. Name of the game: Skill and playstyle> Quote "Meta" ships\n\n10/10 would be called ♥♥♥♥♥♥ again","March 2","true","17.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It\'s everything I could ask to have in a space game where you control one of mainy big ships in a team of 5 and fight to control the battle against another team of 5 big ships, there is a fair amount of strategy involved since there are Relays (Alpha 1 and 2 on one side & Beta 1 and 2 on the other) to jump too and 3 mines inbetween that net your team Resources (exp?) if you control them. Gamma station in the middle which periodically goes live and needs to be captured to gain your team a buff and then the 2 main bases where either team spawns with 5 turret generators to be destroyed and then the base to be captured to win.\n\nThis explination is far from the best but it\'s the best I can do in terms of making it simple, each ship has its own style of abilities and role to play in combat ranging from different offensive roles, defencive roles and support roles. The fact that it\'s free to play is also very inviting, I also feel that the game is far from pay 2 win because within my experience all the ships I have come across (3 starter ships and 7 other ships from different tiers) are all fairly balanced just rely on the player executing their role properly to do well in the game.\n\nSo anyways thank you very much for taking the time to read this some what amatuer review and I would definitely recommend this game if you love Big Battle Ships in Space! - 9/10","May 31","true","19.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The level of detail each ship has is stunning. It's a joy seeing your turrents pivot and track your pointer. Your orientation is important, different ships have different fields of fire, some favor broadside action, others at the fore, others have smart guns that fire inderectly, and so on. It's a joy to see each turret open up depending where you are aiming.\n\nNo ship feels more powerful than the other, nor is one loadout better than the next, they just give you more options and choices, and the chance to really personalize some ships and find your own style.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the 10 player matches are very intense, but newbie friendly. You can have veterans and newbies in the same team and not feel like you're babysitting anyone or the other way arround. The controls and mechanics are very intuitive, making the game easy to master. That doesn't make it boring though! The magic is in the slugging matches between crafts, and that never gets old.\nIt's very close to a perfect information game, you almost always know what the enemy is doing, and he knows what you're doing too. That means that strategy is key here, knowing when to split your team, or stay together takes a while to sink in, but seeing an impromptu party of strangers work together as a well oiled machine is worth it.\n\nThe company is very active and constantly adding stuff, with a new ship appearing in an almost monthly basis. This is a very solid and underappreciated game, and it's pretty unique in what it has to offer. It's less of a moba in space, and more of chess in space. Less about using complex abilities and gear and more about anticipating your enemy and cooperating with your ally.

For a early access game, its very fun, but you do need team work for this game or you will lose. Ive only come accross 1 bug where i could not see where i was shooting, still still killed them but a little slower.\n\nThe only thing i say about the game that it need more maps and more ships are on there way.\n\nFor ships, you can get med size fast ships to slow big ships and ships that when they get very close, they will make you a new ♥♥♥!@# for you, and you got a ship that can clock and snick up behind you and do the same, but of cause theres ships that can counter the other ships. Ships that can heal but can't take much damage so you got to protect it.\n\nSo If you after a space battle game thats got lots of big booms and big ships going boom, than this is the game for you!\n9/10","February 3, 2015","true","33.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

As opposed to most space fighter games where you are a single fighter zipping around and shooting everything in sight, this game actually takes planning. Since you are a colossal ship, each move is important to the success of your team. You must plan with your teammates or risk being overtaken. Deciding on which side to capture is all important for when you make that all important push the their base. The different classes are different enough that there isn't just one superior class that all others lose to. Some a devastating alone, others are better in small packs and still others are best served with a support ship behind them.

The level of detail each ship has is stunning. It's a joy seeing your turrents pivot and track your pointer. Your orientation is important, different ships have different fields of fire, some favor broadside action, others at the fore, others have smart guns that fire inderectly, and so on. It's a joy to see each turret open up depending where you are aiming.\n\nNo ship feels more powerful than the other, nor is one loadout better than the next, they just give you more options and choices, and the chance to really personalize some ships and find your own style.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the 10 player matches are very intense, but newbie friendly. You can have veterans and newbies in the same team and not feel like you're babysitting anyone or the other way arround. The controls and mechanics are very intuitive, making the game easy to master. That doesn't make it boring though! The magic is in the slugging matches between crafts, and that never gets old.\nIt's very close to a perfect information game, you almost always know what the enemy is doing, and he knows what you're doing too. That means that strategy is key here, knowing when to split your team, or stay together takes a while to sink in, but seeing an impromptu party of strangers work together as a well oiled machine is worth it.\n\nThe company is very active and constantly adding stuff, with a new ship appearing in an almost monthly basis. This is a very solid and underappreciated game, and it's pretty unique in what it has to offer. It's less of a moba in space, and more of chess in space. Less about using complex abilities and gear and more about anticipating your enemy and cooperating with your ally.

If you want smaller, nimble craft then they are also here.  If you want snipers then you have them and if you want sneaky cloaky ships then its all here.\nThe game is great and is improving constantly and plays just fine on my pretty low end laptop on low to medium graphics and still looks great!\nIf you are a fan of small team based combat games such as WoT and Warthunder and also a fan of huge spaceships then look no further!","August 9, 2015","true","10.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Obviously the game is subject to change, bear that in mind for any review.]\n\nWonderful game. Ton of fun, active developer support, Lobbies fill up quickly regardless of region VERY easy to get a match going pretty much any time of day. It may take a few minutes to get started, but that's even true of player-count juggernauts like Call of Duty.\n\nFractured Space has interesting and fairly balanced gameplay. Every ship is relevant in some way, but choosing the right ship for the task always matters. Ping is almost irrelevant in matches - I've experienced no difference in gameplay between 40 and 350 ping. It's in early alpha, so there are a few problems that are typical of that sort of thing, but they're mostly addressed quickly and effectively.\n\nThere's one final progression wipe coming on the 21st of January, so playing before then might suck a bit if you don't want the exclusive skins they give as a reward for high-levels prior to the wipe. But the game itself is a lot of fun regardless, and definitely worth your time and the rather minor $10 investment it takes to get it.","December 22, 2015","true","60.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

But given how well the product is presented as is, I am confident that the devs will fix most of if not all of my complaints. The main problem is the utter lack of explanation, whether it be a proper control tutorial, or how to accomplish in-game objectives. All you get is an image showing the key layout.\n\nAfter some trial and error, I began to pick up on the nuances of each ship, and how they all contribute to a battle. The basic controls, once explained, are easy to use, with some fancy manuvering possible once you get the hang of it. Objectives at the moment are of the "stand near to capture" variety, with little else to do besides shoot people, but the shooting itself is fairly complex with the number of unique abilities available to each ship.\n\nSlight gameplay inbalances and bugginess, both of which are symptoms emblematic of Early Access, I believe this game is worth the purchase, especially at the current price of $10.","November 21, 2014","true","1.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

NOTE THAT ABOUT THIS REVIEW!!\n\nThis game need ALOT of fixing and adding if its going to be worth anything.\n\nHowever.. I will give an easy setup of good and bad parts of this so far.\n\nPositive:\n\n- Good space mechanics: It feels like you are flying a massive ship in space. Which is good cause its a space combat sim.\n\n- Ships and critical points: There are ship classes that are somewhat ballanced. Some unfair (looking at the cloak and short range 1 hit kill switch one) , but it all makes it better when you can damage parts of ships and take even MOAR damage!\n\n- Combat: Combat is slow, yet fast. Its like I have said.. It feeeeels like a space game that you see in Homeworld and typical space games/sci fi games. Cannons takes time to turn and same does the ships. Its like Star Conflict done more realistic.\n\nNEGATIVE PARTS!!!\n\n- Cloak and short range weapons: Probably the most broken ship in the game. Dont remember the name of the ship (assault I think), BUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE!! It is stupid. Compare to the Sniper class, this ship is broken and either needs a huge nerf or be terminated.\n\n- The game outside graphics and game mechanics: Apparently from what I see, its going to be a MMO PVP MOBA ish game. It also has a cheap version of Star Conflict with the lobby. From what I see, there will be only online gaming with this game and no PVE.\n\n- Gamemodes: Capture the enemy headquarters... oooooooooh thats boring... that is the only gamemode at this point. OOOOOOH THAT IS BORING!\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is really not much to say about this game, cause there is almost nothing in this.\n\nIts not a bad game, just feel the DEVS are holding it back. ALOT. They could have added Deathmatch, team deathmatch or anything else to make it more fun, or even have more variants that are not so "straight out of the class system book of any mmo / RPG game".\nOwell. I suggest not buying the game yet. Maybe later? Only time will tell.\n\nGonna give it a thumbs up cause... the devs to see that they can do it.","November 20, 2014","true","6.5"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Crew members give flat bonuses to your ship. Previously you could just buy the crewmembers you liked with normal ingame currency. Now you have to draft them from 'drop pods', which give you a random crewmember of varying rarity and power. Or sometimes no crewmember at all, instead pitifully small credit bonuses or DNA.\n\n..what's DNA? Well! In order to use a crewmember after you drafted them, you still have to use DNA to actually unlock them. How do you get DNA? Why, only through openeing yet more drop pods, of course!\n\nAnd how do you get droppods? Well, they come in 3 rarities. Each one exceedingly more costly in ingame currency. Or you could just spend a hundred bucks and buy 110 drop pods. Which won't even get you all the crewmembers.

The different ships provide very different roles very well and it's been a blast trying them all out.

I'm fortunate enough to have a fairly meaty PC for it, and the ships look like the awesome, kilometre-long juggernauts of space death that they are. The weapon effects are nice, too, and give a nice impression of the amount of laser/missile/energy stuff the ships fling at each other, and the resultant damage.\nGameplay-wise, it's fairly straightforward: float around in big starships, unload weapons-based punishment on each other, and capture control points around the map, with the aim of capturing the enemy's home base (while they do the same to you). I was understandably not very good in my very first game, but it's fun enough to make me want to keep playing and get virtual medals, promotions, crew and ship upgrades as I strive to become un-useless. However, I like to think that I and my 6000+ crew members all died noble deaths. Again. And again.

I played now and then about 10 games for 2 months. No grand choice of ships, just Protector, Hunter, Colossus, Venturer and maybe 5 other ships. Also the bases weren't painted or detailed.\n\nI expected all of this from an Early Access game in it's alpha.\n\nWhat you saw 4 to 5 months ago raised your expectations for this game and then I started playing again a month ago:\n\nThere are now very detailed bases in each sector with 3 or 4 different asteroid maps to battle in, the ships are absolutley gorgeous (except the ghost which reminds me of southparks a*** probe) and the effects are beautiful.\nThe Shiptree (or Character tree) now counts 26+ ships from 3 different manufacturers with unique looks and weapon systems.\n\nI myself favor the Titan Defense Systems [TDS] because their ships feature an often sleek and well shaped exterior with awesome beamweapons and Smartguns [they're locking on to the enemy in a limited angle and do not make that much damage]. The TDS tree also offers some of the most potent healers [e.g. Protector, Paladin].\n\nAs far as I can tell most ships are pretty balanced, some are more or less annoying depending on which ship you fly.\nAll ships are accessible via playing the game and for most of them you need like 10 games.\nBUT the 3 starter ships are completly sufficient and count to the [IMO] better ships.\nYou can customize the stats of your ship to a certain degree with specialized crewmembers [damage resistance, multiplier etc. pp. in the range from 4-10%]\n\nEverything gameplay relevant is FREE TO PLAY [yes you can buy ingame currency and with it ships, but hey where's the fun with that; also there aren't any ships that are completly over the top good so you have no real advantage].\nThe ingame market sells only cosmetics and xp- and creditbooster [the latter you can aquire by lootcrates (so called droppods) which you get for playing at least 2 games at one day].\n\nThe general goal of the game is gathering as many resources through occupied mines in 2 sectors as possible, engaging in epic space battles at the main mining station in the middle of the map and ultimately capping the enemy base while destroying every enemy ship on the way [or vice versa :) ].\n\nSo I can only recommend this game to all people who like capitalspaceships, explosions, strategy and to a certain degree MOBA's.","May 25","true","102.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I advise you to consider this review not too seriously due to my lack of game-play time in it.\n\nIntroduction:\nI found this game on a 'Steam Free Weekend' and I downloaded for a bit because I had seen TheMightyJingles play it and was heavily interested in it for the most part. After playing it that weekend, I had a bit of fun, a few frustration moments, and overall a good time. But after that weekend, I wasn't convinced enough to buy it, so I simply forgot about the game until recently it went into a 'Free-to-play' state, which I really liked, and I gave it another try and found myself loving it so far for these few games and hours.\n\n\n\nPros:\n+ The game looks beautiful and amazing. I have it all maxed out on an Radeon R9 290 with an AMD FX-6300 and 16GB of RAM, and it looks simply gorgeous whenever I play it. (Considering all you'll see is explosions-mayhem-fest, this is a great sign of good optimization.)\n+ It handles well with the network. I rarely see any lag spikes on my internet. Where I shoot, I score.\n+ Simple to learn.\n+ Space-ships are incredibly unique.\n+ Roles are amazingly well diversified. (Support, Attacker, Tank, and so on.)\n+ Easy controls to adapt to.\n+ Excellent adaptation of a MOBA in space. It really works.\n+ Game shines best if you're playing with five of your friends with TS on. It's a beauty to just steamroll everything with great communication and skill.\n+ It doesn't seem P2W. I have seen those 'Premium' ships in action on the opposing team and on my team, and I have won against them. They aren't overpowered.\n\nCons:\n- There's no Teamwork unless you push the team or play with friends and a microphone. (Get ready for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ matches if you're playing alone!)\n- Grindy, as expected.\n- The variety with maps is vague. I would love to see other types of maps.\n- The variety in game-modes is even worse. I would love to see other types of game-modes.\n\n\nVerdict:\nWould I recommend this game? Definitely, but bring friends with you! -- 8/10\n\n\n/// * Will update 'Cons' and 'Pros' as I go.","June 1","true","7.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Now for my full opinion on this game.\n\nI joined during the free weekend of this game, however after playing 25 matches I have found out what I consider what the good bad and ugly of this game are. Lets start with the ugly.\n\nUgly - Its in early access.... ya .... as we all know this means the game can change or be cancelled at any time with very little warning so I myself after the stomping lands, and cube world fiasco have held off on purchasing early access games. That being said the developers seem extremley into this game and fingers crossed looks like they will for along time coming. More ugly now. The leaderboards in the current state are kinda really crap lol, they are working on it to drastically improve them but currently they are simply just bad. The in game honor is calculated very weirdly and makes no sense in its current state. You can organize the leaderboard by everything except kill death ratio which makes no sense to me since that is in my opinion one of the most important things to sort by.\n\nBad- Now for the bad this is the stuff that the game could fix with a little bit of work. To start weakpoints..... for the love of god especially when flying the sniper ship at weak points on every ship that makes the gunplay far more balanaced. It makes it more balanced due to the fact that now as a corvette or other small ship and you run into any type of ship that has damage you literally have no chance. If you added a weak spot the little ship now has a chance to out manuever the bigger ship and take it out by  hitting the weak point. Another that goes  hand in hand with weak points is ships being effected by damage. currently you can be shot wherever and  have nothing happen. However i should be able to aim for the engines of the opposing ship and take them out he should lose alot of mobility makeing him way slower atleast for a short time till his engines are fixed. giving players a chance to be extremley tactical in their battles with opponents. remember this isnt stuff necessary for the game but i believe it would add to the game greatly. Another thing for  future would be more maps and even larger scale battle so  instead of 5 on 5 maybe 10 on 10 just to make battles even more epic this is space lol.\n\nGood- Finally to the good. As is this game has absorbed 15 hours of my time already and its only been like 4 days so ya im a little obssesed.  This is essentialy a space ship moba everyship is unique in damage health and abilities so it takes a little bit to find out what gamestyle you like and can do best in. The way to unlock ships is to use a ship belonging to one of the three factions. every game you play with gains xp to unlock new loadouts for ships in that faction and new ships themselves. Also every game you play you get credits after you unlock things with xp you then use the credits to actually purchase the upgrades or ships themselves. The gameplay itself is very very easy to learn and master. after about my 5th game I have not had a game were i didnt get 10 plus kills 3 or less deaths and 7 or so base captures. if you have a nack for shooters the game is fairly easy to learn and your personal skills matters alot more than in other shooters that put too much reflex gameplay into the way you play. The visuals in this game are also very beautiful and keep the blankness of space interesting. Matches unlike most other mobas take about 15-30 mins to play I just had my longest match every at 46min which is about the average length of a match in most other mobas so this game is much easier to play if you only get 30 min to play here and there.\n\nOverall I would rate the game as follows\n\nOverall 8/10\ngameplay 9/10\ngraphics 8/10\naudio 7/10\nstats/leaderboards 5/10\nI hope you enjoy this game as much as I do and I hope you support the developers to help encourage them to keep making and improving this game so i can come in and revise this post and rate the game a 10 out of 10\n\n\n","April 21, 2015","true","12.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Anyway 2015-04-15 comments.\n\nFinal verdict: I got to play it during the free weekend and it was quite enjoyable. If I had to pay full price to play it I'd probably wait for the developers to add more game modes and to see what kind of premium options the developers plan to offer in the in-game shop.\n\nThere were 3 ships instantly available and 9 more can be accessed by playing the game and unlocking them. So far only skins for ships seems to be cash only with the potential for Premium ships and crew members to be added to the shop later. So far it's too early to say if these premium options will be pay-to-win.\n\nEach of the ships has a primary and a secondary weapon as well as some other weapons.\nPrimary weapons are mainly lasers but they vary in damage, speed, effective shooting angles (for some the target needs to be right in from of your ship) and other aspects (some do more damage with each hit so you need to be very close to make sure that you hit all your shots, while some are slower and effective at maximum range).\nSecondaries and other weapons can vary greatly,they can allow you to teleport to another location, activate extra shields, fire repairing lasers at you teammates, disable your target's systems, activate a movement speed boots and so on.\nSo far it seems the ships can be only slightly customized by choosing from some pre-set options (faster+less damage or slower+more damage and so on), but I guess that is needed for balancing reasons.\n\nSo far the only game mode is a 5v5 Domination. The gameplay is mainly team oriented, but if you are playing against a not very coordinated team a single player can still carry his team to victory, but generally a balanced team composition and a coordinated team effort (of defending points and attacking) is needed.","April 21, 2015","true","9.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It's been over a year now, and the game has grown a lot. Me still playing the game should give credit to my positive review of it, so instead  of talking about the game, I'll talk about some reviews I'm seeing from people with under 10 hours. From my own experience, this game is in no way pay to win. Sure, it takes time to unlock those high tier ships, but trust me, it's for your own benifit. I've never once felt the urge to pay for a ship in this game, so don't let those people make you think it's something it's not. It's more of a warframe like grind, though nowhere close to as grindy as that game. Everything is unlockable in game. The only other major problem right now(besides drones still being under developement) is the lack of playerbase. The matchmaking system is great, but there aren't enough people playing right now. I hope that it going free to play helps newcomers come in, and for those longtime players in there(you know who you are and what you say in chat) how about you try being a little nicer to people getting into the game? If you rage everytime someone makes a mistake, there eventually won't be any players left because of your bad attitude.","February 2, 2015","true","122.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

However I've heard from friends with better gear that, while less prevelant, the frames drop/freeze on occasion.\n\nBalancing, for the most part the ships are balanced, with a few notable acceptions, primarily the amount of teamwork required to run a gladiator effectively, the brawler, the paragon (actually locked by devs because it was so imbalanced), and the protector, who with the right crew only takes 25% of incoming damage, and out heals damage from 1-2 players simultaneously attacking.\n\nBug are bugs, it's alpha, they happen.\n\nNow this game, dispite the issues, is amazing. The immersion is great, voice lines are great, all shops are well balanced, and a million more plusses. Some may say the grind is unbearable but that just isn't true. I was able to get a new ship within 4 games, and the more expensive ships require the grind because they are specialized. The grind is there to make sure you can actually play those late unlocks well.\n\nOverall, this game is an 8.5 out of 10, higher once the lag issues are fixed (again, may just be my potato pc)\n\nAlso devs, please please please add in game comms!","February 8","true","16.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/N0ps/recommended/310380/","N0ps","N0ps","http://steamcommunity.com/id/N0ps/","64 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis review is being made after the April update that rendered the game Free to Play and introduced the case system. i should also put a disclaimer saying that I bout into the Alpha and bought the highest priced package at the time, so there might be some bias.\n\nFirst of, I would like to respond to some of the more vocal fans of the game that are complaining about the case system and claiming it's now a pay to win game. No. Some try to mislead you by saying that all but the starter crew are locked off and that this is causing a huge imbalance as people who pay unlock different crew. They are correct, you can only get the starter crew and do need to grind or pay to get other crew, but this does not affect game balance in any significant way. All crew are side-grades from each other, and while ships work better with crew that compliment their abilities, the affect is minimal and any specialized ship will lose something for it's upgrades. Any specialized ship can still be taken down by a starter crewed ship easily if that ship is used right.\n\nNow that I got that out of the way, onto the review. Fractured Space is a unique game, taking elements from MOBAs and vehicle battle games like World of Warships, and for the sake of adding it in, Hero Shooter like Overwatch and Battleborn with the latter having a higher resemblance. The game relies heavily on team work, the correct ship composition and very heavily on how good yo are with your ship. The game can be a grind as you need EXP and DNA to earn ships and crew, but the starter ships give you everything you need for a fair and balanced team that can hold of most teams. Ships can be earned with EXP, which you get by playing games in ships of the same tech tree, and crew are acquired as random drops that you get in crates that also require DNA to craft. While the crew system is abhorrent, it doesn't affect the game that much and is the only major downside and is not as bad as others will have you think.\n\nFor an Alpha game, Fractured space shows a lot of promise and already lives up a lot of praise it gets. The gameplay is solid, although the UI needs some tweaks before release, and it looks amazing with the Unreal Engine. If you're into it, you could easily lose weeks to this game, and it hasn't even come out yet! Of the games flaws, other than the crate system, many of them are not the games fault. There still appear to be a massive amount of new players that don't know much about the game mechanics and the tutorial is still in need of touching up so that player will also learn how to synergize with their team mates. The two game modes are fun, although I have not played any Frontline and am basing that opinion on what I have seen, and it is always fun to ram your colossus into a disabled enemy Ghost. Overall, I recommend you get this game.","June 2","true","25.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It's only 10 bucks now, they plan on it being free upon completion (though if you buy it now not only are you supporting the development of the game (these things do cost money to make you know) but you get "Founder" status, though they havent decided what the "Founders" will recieve yet) and I think it has great potential. I'd hate to see this game be a flop, it's too promising for that. I've literally as of writing this review only played about 10 or 15 minutes of the game and can already tell some of the pros and cons.\n\nPROS\n-Beautiful graphics, especially considering it's not even finished yet\n-You get to cruise around in a giant spaceship, instant winner\n-The crew (although a recent addition to the game) responds to your commands, calls contacts, and, apparently, will talk sh!t to your enemies later\n-Guess that's all my pros after 15 mins of gameplay\n\nCONS\n-Weapons seem limited at this stage of development\n-Maps feel cramped with all the stations and asteroids (maybe it was just me though, I was usingthe biggest ship in the game)\n-That's really my only complaints so far\n\nSo yeah, that's all I've got to say 'bout that.

(I die alot, even in premium ships).\n\nThe controlls are super fluid, the ships move around exactly as you would expect and you can see all the Retro rocket thrusters pushing your ship around through space as you turn, straffe & bank.\nSome ships have abilities like, boost which really has a lovely effect on it when the main engine cranks up and blasts you through space.\nthe game kind of feels like a moba in terms of how the map behaves, you have a "Left", "Right" and "center" or as they are called in the game, Alpha, Beta & Gamma sectors. You cannot move between them by using your engines, you must Jump using your hyperdrive to get there, which is on a 30 or so second cool down for the biggest ships, you become extra week while jumping but you use this feature to move between sectors and take control of mining and forward command center bases, once you control the left or the right lane you can jump to the enemy base and start working on that. The Gamma sector in the middle becomes active every 10 minutes, whoever captures this gets a big boost for their teams stats.\n\nNow I highly suggest you download this FREE game and give it a shot yourself.\n\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\n\nGO GO GO.","May 28","true","22.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Add on beutiful visuals and brilliant effects, and you have got this game. This game is an intense 3rd person ship combat sim, every moment, you will be making a dicision that could save thousands (or kill thousands). Game balance is near perfect. Every ship has its unique purpose, and stats, with a counterplay for every single one. So no OP sniper you cant seem to get.You can also deploy starfighters and watch as a massive space-dogfight unfold infront of you (until of course, your point defence gets into range and shreds the opposing fighters).

If you want a game in a more fleshed-out state, with only a few, minor bugs, and polished interfaces, this is not the game for you!\n\nThat being said, as far as capital-ship-fighting games go (a sadly limited genre), this one is pretty damn good. The graphics are impressive, with lots of explosions back and forth, and ships that are well designed with all the blinking lights and gew-gaws we've come to expect. The controls are simple and (mostly) intuitive, such that some basic playing around will make sense out of most of them, all the while giving you the feeling of being at the helm of a massive warship.\n\nThe basic gameplay is essentially that of a MOBA (League of Legends, Defense of the Ancients, etc.). You'll jump from sector to sector, capturing space facilities and engaging enemy players. Sometimes it'll be a solo encounter, two ships bobbing around each other, exchanging fire and close-range missiles. Other times, both fleets will meet and light up the darkness between asteroids. Both are impressive in there way, and fans of Star Trek, Star Wars, and Battlestar Galactica will feel right at home!\n\nShips come in various classes, from your stealthy cloakers, to the fast-attack hunters, to long-range artillery ships, and all the way up to capitals with broadsides that can make a planet ♥♥♥♥ its pants. Each has a primary weapon and secondary ability (slaved to the left and right mouse buttons, respectively), plus other support abilities used via the number keys. You can move in all dimensions (x, y, and z for you Cartesian-types), though you cannot pitch or roll. It has that slow, lumbering feeling you would expect in such large vessels, but without feeling sluggish or unresponsive.\n\nIf you don't feel comfortable purchasing Early Access games, the developers are planning to take it F2P early next year. If nothing else, give it a shot. You'll be pleasantly surprised!\n\nFull ahead, helm!","November 22, 2014","true","1.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

I see people complaining about how you can buy overpowered ships but in realty only 2 actually exists that you can, and they would be premium tanks going by the world of tanks analogy. here; however, they are exact copies of normal ships off of the main tech tree except they are        un-upgradeable, and if a noob tries to play them they fail, hard. you can also buy normal ships with platinum (gold/money bought currency etc) however you have to unlock them with xp just like everything else and as the experience is locked in a tech tree you normally have the money you want to buy them far before you have the xp.\nI have seen some people talk about how the grind is only bearable if you use money but this Is completely false, you can buy boosts with platinum that when applied after a game will increase what you got in the game, but it still relies on what your skill is and the base rewards. these are also single use, unlike world of tanks premium time.\nYou can also get purely cosmetic skins with it.\nwhy I say it is less so than wot is you cannot make "free xp" with it, as anyone who plays it would know. now on to the review (this was written after I finished)\n\n\n\nWhile some of the ships are designed to defeat others as well as long respawn times and no changing class, it makes it kind of annoying when playing but other than that it is a fantastic game.\n\nEDIT: wow its been a long time since I first made this, time for some more detail.\nFractured space is very fun, while the matches last a long time its gameplay is superb leading towards very fun encounters. There are issues with this game that seem almost impossible for the devs to fix, however. their option to lock the ships into what you originally pick is still a problem, but less so as there are a great deal of them now so the counters that I spoke of in the first review do not really stick as hard. however there are new problems as you cannot connect to a game in progress if someone else disconnects which causes a lot of unbalanced gameplay, framerate is also a problem with your game freezing for a few seconds every minute or so in some lobbies.\n\nThe balance in the game also needs a lot of work, you will have those people yell that everything is perfectly balanced and you just don't know how to use it correctly (which is disproven by the fact that 1. the devs aren't gods and 2. every time there is a balance patch it proves that they weren't balanced before.) and the ones who go full ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that say teamwork beats any op ship ignoring the fact that two balanced teams playerwise would be affected. In reality due to the massive update awhile ago balance isn't close to perfect, with some ships suffering immensely as they rely entirely on missiles for damaged that are blocked 100% of the time when someone activates point defense, which can now be on practically forever until you run out of energy which has never even gotten close to happening to me. others such as the protector can completely heal ships much faster than multiple people can put out damage. this may not seem like a big deal at the start as healers are a common theme in these games but due to the fact that they're healing ability is massive and they have a shield that absorbs almost all damage, they are impossible to deal with unless multiple people all attack at once, and if the enemy ships are even semi competent, because you are going after the support they will rip you to shreds. combine this with the fact you cannot change classes and no one can come in once it starts and you have a huge disadvantage if one team has one and the other does not, and while not having a medic should be a bad thing, when there are only a few people every bit of unlockable xp is precious it makes it much more difficult than it should be.\n\nIm sure you have heard this from every review and that is the grind. due to the problems with the number of ships the majority are locked behind a number of games that while they would be quick for most games suffer due to the time of the match, this leads to playing the same ships over and over until you can get ones that you like, however unlike what most say this is not a huge pain as the starter ships are very well rounded and teach you the game.

Ship types and abilities are diverse and interesting, from devestating broadsides, disabling beams and quick flickering jumps you can utilize to get behind your opponent. The focus on team tactics is strong and the glacial pace (compared to other "shooters") is a refreshing change - you're forced to think and outmaneouver your enemies instead of just gunning them down.","March 21, 2015","true","6.7"," 26 of 46 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","26","46","4","2"

A lot of the negative reviews are out of date, so they're not so reliable. One thing I don't like is that the while the game is about flying capital ships, their firepower seems underwhelming compared to what you see in other sci-fi media.\n\nGraphics:\nShips look great.\nStations and asteroids look kinda bland, but the game is still in alpha, so I hope they're just placeholders.\nEffects are hit and miss, as some are much better than others. Likely due to the game's alpha status.\n\nGameplay:\nOn the surface it seems kinda dull, but spend a little time learning what each ship can do and a whole lot of possibilities open up. Deployment of ships can win or lose games, as an ambush on a ship or a station at the right time can tip the balance. The game encourages teamwork as each ship type has a role to play.\n\nSound:\nIt's your average pew pew in space sounds. Nothing bad, but nothing outstanding.\nThe ship's crew talks to you in game, providing tips disguised as immersive voice acting. A nice touch.\n\nLongevity:\nThere's a bunch of ships available, but only a few game modes and maps. In it's current state, I reckon I could get 10-15 hours enjoyment from it. However, as I've mentioned, the game is still in alpha so there will be more content to come.\n\nI got the game for free, but I wouldn't buy it in its current state. Luckily the game will be available as a free to play/pay game when it leaves early access. So definitely give it a go once it reaches that stage.","November 20, 2015","true","4.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

That was until i found this game 0.3hrs ago.That was all the time i needed to cook some eggs benedict on my cpu. I'm sooo full! Thanks devs!\n\nThanks so much guys for the awesome oven simulator.\n\nI was gonna give it 8/10 but...9/10 for making your bread toasting function compatible with my Geforce gtx960 G1 Gaming graphics card. It performs so well with my card that it only took 2 minutes to lightly toast some sourdough. I was tinkering with it a little bit and i found that this function is a nice little piece of reusable code! You can adjust the graphics options to high for grilled cheese, while putting everything on max allows for the perfect environment for a delicious roast pork or, if you can spare the oil, some deep fried Mars bars! Whatever it is you guys are doing, keep it up!\n\nI'm certain you could get 10/10 if you integrated some kind of timer into the oven simulator so people could be warned when their supper isn't far from done or something like that (but i'm not a game designer, so i don't even know if that would make for a better cooking experience, that stuff is way too deep for level of understanding).

Except you play the whole match, not only few minutes (or seconds). And you dont have to grind hundreds of matches for next ship! Also, I like the prospect of every ship being unique and not "just straight up better". Even with advanced "Tier 2" ship, I can easily get killed with basic ship. Unlike WoWs, where "Tier 2" is straight up better than "Tier 1".\n\nI was also surprised, that in about 30 matches I played, I was matched two times with someone from the development team. For me, this is nice sign that they are making game that they love, that its not just stupid business for them, and also that they are in touch with community, and that they know what they are doing.\n\nPositives\n+ Fair business model. I have never felt like I have a need to buy a booster to "get even" or get something from the match\n+ Interesting FTL based map with various strategies.\n+ Doesn't feel grindy (It is important to note that Im in early stages of the game, and it could become a grind later)\n+ Interesting ship design and purpose. I didnt find a ship that I could say "it's objectively better than this ship" its always trade offs, even in upgrade system.\n\nNegatives\n- Limited ship selection (Most likely due to the game being in Alpha)\n- Lag Issues (Possibly due to the "free" weekend)\n\n\n","February 1","true","32.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

As an alpha, I'm totally impressed. I've never seen a game capture capital ship combat like this before. Most importantly, the microtransactions add little to no imbalance - they may speed the rate at which you unlock ships, but only somewhat, since you still need XP, which is not purchasable via microtransaction.

The ship models are very cool, and the weapons are exquisite, even the ship abilities are nice with alittle bit of everything for every kind of player. All that being said I find some ships to be far more powerful than others, with each ship excelling in its respected field but with a few ships (like the Brawler) who seem more then capable at taking on even the larger enemies unprepared and either winning or drastically crippling the fleet. I hope it gets nerfed in the future. Another importance of the review of this game is its high team orientation, the team has to work together, even just meenial coordination is not enough to win, sure you might win the battle but you will certainly lose the war, putting more pressure on specific players in specific ships and hoping those people understand what needs to be done. A small pet peev of mine though is that your "squad" is only able to hold you and 1 other instead of a full team which i find alittle unorthodox because of its heavy team mechanics. All in all i give the game an 8/10, id like to see more ships added, some more upgrades added for sure and a co-op scenario in the future along with a few balance tweeks.","February 2","true","99.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If you come from games like World of Warships and the like, you will instantly notice a couple things.\n\n1. No Tier system. All the ships fill a role and are useful. No "this ship sucks, well better get ready for the 15 hours i have to play with it for me to get the next ship that may not be trash in its tier" or "yay yet another match in which im the lowest tier so gg me"\n\n2. The grind is nothing in comparison and doesnt feel like a chore since ALL THE SHIPS ARE GOOD! XD Not to mention unlike Wargamming games you arnt required to buy upgrades or play a certain ship to unlock the next one. Your only limited by the manufacturer.  No "lol pay use to grab exp from another ship so you can bypass this trash". For that matter who else hates buying slots with real money currency to store the ships you spent 15+ hours grinding for?\n\nIf your comming from a traditional MOBA (i.e. LoL, Smite) youll soon realise this isnt a "MOBA" in the traditional sense. It takes some MOBA staples and throws it into a tactics based positional ship battle setting. No creeps to last hit for moneys, no items, team levels based on held points on the map. In game there is little customisation except for three instances where you can decide to improve your offence, defence, or utility capabilities. Outside of the game there are various "sidegrades" you can buy to change your ships performance to your liking. This games main focus is on combat, team coordination, and positioning in a fast paced setting.\n\nTLDR\n\nPros:\n- Fast paced engaging tactical ship combat.\n- Easy grind that requires you to earn exp befor you can buy a ship with in game currency OR real money currency. Makes you get good before you buy high skill req ships. (aside from a few premium ships)\n- Mostly friendly community. Active Devs!\n\nCons:\n- Currently can only enter match making with a group of 1 - 2, though this will be changed to support full teams as they work on their match making system.\n- Minor server instability, mainly with issues involving finding a match.

Easy to get started since you don't have to remember the abilities of a massive selection of characters like standard MOBAs, but it can also get repetative for the same reason given that unlocks take a long time so you have a small pool to choose from. There is a random ship mode, but it is much less widely played (so it takes a lot longer to get a game) than the standard 5v5 where you pick.

I have played this game a number of times ranging from its \"free weekend\" it had early on in development, to just last week. I have seen this game change in a number of ways for the better, and I think that this game is worth playing now, with even more potential and merit soon to come.\n\nGranted:\nThis game might be a bit on the short side for now, but it is in early development stages. They currently have one PvP mode , a training mode, a ship testing facility, and a mode for custom games. That being said, they have a lot of room for improvement in that specific field.\n\nTo fix this for example:\n\nThey could add the ability to bring more friends into a given PvP matchmaking team (instead of the current 3).\nThey could add different maps to the current selection (with perhaps differently placed objectives).\nThey could make larger scaled matches (for teams of perhaps 7 or 8 on each side).\n\nThese are just a few suggestions, that I believe we will come to see in time.\n\nAs far as as the actual gameplay and ships go, there are also a few problems:\n\nShip scaling along a manufacturer tree is dangerously close to unbalanced (aka there is definitely a ship priority).\nPremium ships can sometimes have unfair advantages.\nMatchmaking only takes your previous performance into account, and matchmaking with friends can be hazardous.\nSome (intentionally)  low performing people with higher-quality ships can be matched against new players (unfairly).\nThere is no easy banning system for removing players who throw games on purpose.\n\n\n\nOn the Pros side:\n\ngood flight mechanics\nexcellent combat system\nappealing cosmetics\ngood play rewards\nasteroids mini-game in matchmaking screen\nreplay value\nship design\nupgradable weapons\ncustomizable ship crew roster\nfree\n\n\n\n","May 31","true","16.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's NOT X-Wing - it's slower-paced and more tactical (but in a good way) and you need to think about things like which side of your ship you're presenting (in fact, in a lot of ways it's almost a tank sim). I love the feel of it: huge ships, atmospheric backgrounds, a very nice UI. It also runs surprisingly well even on my three year-old PC.

But, after having put a decent amount of time intoit, I have to say, it's really fun. The battles are super intense, the ships are cool, and the game looks great. All of this is made even better by the fact that the game is now free. In my opinion, it really isn't even too difficult of a game to just pick up and start playing. I even think the matchmaking system has improved recently. At first, matchmaking was pretty awful. It took forever and crashed about fifty percent of the time, but I think it really has improved. The amount of time I've had to wait for a match has definitely decreased. I'm also really excited to see what new things they add to this game, since it's still in early access.

No, really, it isn't! It's pay to unlock - ships unlocked with real world currency are in no way better or worse than any other ship. Higher tier ships are just more specialized, not better, even though the way the shipe are arranged in the tech tree might give you that impression. And you can still unlock them with ingame currency.\nIf you got killed by a higher tier ship it's likely because this player is just more experienced. Fractured space is a game that's easy to get into, yet is hard to master.\n\n2) "WTF, I payed for that game, now it's F2P?"\n\nYou didn't buy the game. You paid for the priviledge of getting into the game earlier than others. You also paid for exclusive content and a lifetime boost to XP and credits after every match. You also supported the developers so they were able to even reached this point.\nAnd yes, the game is free to play now - as was always intended and communicated by the devs in douzens of different places. Yes, even the steam store stated that from day one! You just didn't read - not the games fault. Now suck it up, get in your ship and join the queue already!\n\n2) "I can't even start the game, what is this garbage?!"\n\nThis "garbage" is an eraly access game in alpha phase. Yes, there are technical problems every now and then. The game was released as f2p to increase player size and get more feedback on things like this. By leaving a negative review you are not helping - just report the issue and come back later to a better game - it's worth it!\n\nAnd to be totally honest here:Yes. The game has issues - it's far from being perfect. There are some issues which are well descibed in other (serious) reviews, even positive ones. But I did mention it's early access, right?\nDo you rember the line "has potential" in the reviews of other early acces games? Fractured space is alreaedy there, despite of it's little problems. It's playable, fun, challenging and engaging even in it's current alpha state.\n\nJust give it a serious try. It deserves it.","May 30","true","334.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The graphics are great thanks to the UT4 engine. The gameplay is something fairly new and fresh despite being based on existing MOBA archetypes.  I felt that there's enough promise to put my $15 USD on the table after playing just a few matches. It's like Homeworld, World of Tanks, and LoL/DOTA/HoTS had a giant party and everyone got together at the end of the night and this sexy minx is the result.\n\nThe Good:  Amazing graphics for a MOBA title\nFresh gameplay for the genre\nIntuitive, easy to master controls\nUnique ship designs that feel plausible as real starships (some folks don't care, but for me that's a HUGE thing)\n\nThe Bad:  HORRIBLE lag issues. (I'm used to SOME lag, but I've had a few matches where I would jump large distances from where I was or where I intended to be without using any speed enhancing abilites.\nNo tutorial, and for a game as complex as this one can be, at times. There needs to be a bit more information about exactly how matches are supposed to work included as perhaps non-intrusive in-game tutorial messages (Move next to the point to capture and so on. Something simple that you can breifly read on screen before it gently fades out). I've managed to work out so far you shoot other ships and capture points on the map, but exactly how to do so in order to achieve victory isn't readily apparent even after reading the in-game "How to Play" primer which barely had enough explanation to fit on an MTG card. There's nothing the actually explains how ship or tech tree progression works either and if you didn't know you could upgrate your ship's systems you'll be less effective as you grind up to the next tier of ship.

In fact, I've been burned several times before and swore to never buy another, yet Fractured Space looked so beautiful in the videos and screenshots I saw, that I couldn't resist picking it up in the Steam Summer Sale. Because this review is Early Access, please bear in mind it's likely to become obsolete as the devs continue to work on the title.\n\nFractured Space is a 5v5 multiplayer game, in which two teams start at opposing sides of a 'map' set in space. There are two routes down the map (Alpha and Beta), and the goal of the game is to control the various fixed outposts down these routes to gain access to the Enemy base. Once the enemy base is captured, the game is won. As both teams have the same objective, clashes within Alpha and Beta force players to think carefully; playing offensively or defensively depending on the enemy's position.\n\nWhen your ship dies, you respawn back in your base and so need to weigh up which side is strategically best; whether to move down an already dominated side, or defend the other from approaching enemy ships. Quite often I've seen badly coordinated teams all move down one side and miss the enemy capturing all the points down the other; a move which usually results in the main base losing some capture points.\n\nThe visuals are beautiful and the ship models are very nicely rendered. Plasma fires ripple down your hull as a barrage of laser shots, from some unseen foe, strikes you suddenly, catching you unawares. The audio is impressive too, with the occasional comment from your AI crew, the immersive thudding of flak fire from the Flagship, or even lightning fast laser fire from a Brawler class.\n\nNow on to the bad points (which, as the title is Early Access, will possibly/probably be ironed out in future updates). Firstly, in running an EVE Online group, I have several players that want to play Fractured Space with me. Although we can join the game together, there is no guarantee that you'll be on the same side. You can elect to switch sides at the beginning, but this often fails to work as the game auto-balances the teams before the action begins. Whilst I can appreciate the reason behind this, it often results in frustration as friends go up against each other, instead of being able to work together.\n\nEach ship has a role, and the roles are all varied. There are snipers, brawlers, destroyers, carriers, corvettes, etc. As you earn experience from each fight, you can unlock more advanced ships and better equipment to install on them. At present there are three tiers of ships, from three different factions, but the upgrade options are a little sparse on the tier two and three ships. Some are just stock loadouts, with no further upgrade possibilities. I suspect, however, that the game devs are working to implement further ships and fittings in future updates, so I wouldn't be too concerned about this for the moment. That said, even without an update to this, it takes little away from the base gameplay, which can often be very intense. The grind for these tier two and three ships isn't too bad either, and I've managed to unlock most in just 16 hours of play.\n\nThe game lasts until the enemy base is captured, as previously stated, be that 5 minutes, 10, 15, 20... Getting a quick game in before bed isn't always a wise move, as leaving a game before the end results in a reward of negative 'honorable conduct' - a move, I dare say, introduced to prevent people leaving games once one team has a distinct advantage over another. In the last two days, I've occasionally found myself on a team fighting 4v5 because someone left the game early. With the teams only consisiting of 5 players per side, the loss of a 5th player makes a great deal of difference to the dynamic of a team - especially with sometimes lengthy respawn timers.\n\nIn conclusion, my friends and I have had a great deal of fun from this game thus far. There are naturally things that the game devs could work on to further improve the game, but as it remains Early Access, it gives the devs the opportunity to do just that.\n\nShould the devs read this review, I would suggest that allowing players the opportunity to work on the same team should be something they spend time investigating as a matter of priority. I would also consider the merits of allowing players to change out their ship choice once a battle has started, as often an enemy team consisting of a Brawler and Sniper combination is often hard to counter, and if you pick your ship class poorly, any battle is just an inevitable waste of time as you slog towards the foregone conclusion of defeat.","June 19, 2015","true","36.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

In fact, I've been burned several times before and swore to never buy another, yet Fractured Space looked so beautiful in the videos and screenshots I saw, that I couldn't resist picking it up in the Steam Summer Sale. Because this review is Early Access, please bear in mind it's likely to become obsolete as the devs continue to work on the title.\n\nFractured Space is a 5v5 multiplayer game, in which two teams start at opposing sides of a 'map' set in space. There are two routes down the map (Alpha and Beta), and the goal of the game is to control the various fixed outposts down these routes to gain access to the Enemy base. Once the enemy base is captured, the game is won. As both teams have the same objective, clashes within Alpha and Beta force players to think carefully; playing offensively or defensively depending on the enemy's position.\n\nWhen your ship dies, you respawn back in your base and so need to weigh up which side is strategically best; whether to move down an already dominated side, or defend the other from approaching enemy ships. Quite often I've seen badly coordinated teams all move down one side and miss the enemy capturing all the points down the other; a move which usually results in the main base losing some capture points.\n\nThe visuals are beautiful and the ship models are very nicely rendered. Plasma fires ripple down your hull as a barrage of laser shots, from some unseen foe, strikes you suddenly, catching you unawares. The audio is impressive too, with the occasional comment from your AI crew, the immersive thudding of flak fire from the Flagship, or even lightning fast laser fire from a Brawler class.\n\nNow on to the bad points (which, as the title is Early Access, will possibly/probably be ironed out in future updates). Firstly, in running an EVE Online group, I have several players that want to play Fractured Space with me. Although we can join the game together, there is no guarantee that you'll be on the same side. You can elect to switch sides at the beginning, but this often fails to work as the game auto-balances the teams before the action begins. Whilst I can appreciate the reason behind this, it often results in frustration as friends go up against each other, instead of being able to work together.\n\nEach ship has a role, and the roles are all varied. There are snipers, brawlers, destroyers, carriers, corvettes, etc. As you earn experience from each fight, you can unlock more advanced ships and better equipment to install on them. At present there are three tiers of ships, from three different factions, but the upgrade options are a little sparse on the tier two and three ships. Some are just stock loadouts, with no further upgrade possibilities. I suspect, however, that the game devs are working to implement further ships and fittings in future updates, so I wouldn't be too concerned about this for the moment. That said, even without an update to this, it takes little away from the base gameplay, which can often be very intense. The grind for these tier two and three ships isn't too bad either, and I've managed to unlock most in just 16 hours of play.\n\nThe game lasts until the enemy base is captured, as previously stated, be that 5 minutes, 10, 15, 20... Getting a quick game in before bed isn't always a wise move, as leaving a game before the end results in a reward of negative 'honorable conduct' - a move, I dare say, introduced to prevent people leaving games once one team has a distinct advantage over another. In the last two days, I've occasionally found myself on a team fighting 4v5 because someone left the game early. With the teams only consisiting of 5 players per side, the loss of a 5th player makes a great deal of difference to the dynamic of a team - especially with sometimes lengthy respawn timers.\n\nIn conclusion, my friends and I have had a great deal of fun from this game thus far. There are naturally things that the game devs could work on to further improve the game, but as it remains Early Access, it gives the devs the opportunity to do just that.\n\nShould the devs read this review, I would suggest that allowing players the opportunity to work on the same team should be something they spend time investigating as a matter of priority. I would also consider the merits of allowing players to change out their ship choice once a battle has started, as often an enemy team consisting of a Brawler and Sniper combination is often hard to counter, and if you pick your ship class poorly, any battle is just an inevitable waste of time as you slog towards the foregone conclusion of defeat.","June 19, 2015","true","36.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I have been waiting for someone to make a game like this for quite a long time. Beautiful graphics and effects accompany an overall awesome idea. Can wait for polish and balance tweaks. Honestly I'm having a blast playing this in its alpha state. I'm pretty harsh on the space genre theres a lot of devlopers out there doing it wrong. These guys however have the potential to strike gold with anyone who enjoys large star ship combat minus the complexity of Eve. The FPS style objectives are fun and keep the pace going. The ship classes all seem to have their place and battles flow organically. I can't help but get excited when jumping into one of the sectors. I cant wait to see this go Gold.\n\nAddressing the rumors of F2P I could see myself spending good money on visual customizations, hopefully they dont fall into P2W because it definately wouldn't bring anything to this Peanut Butter and Jelly game.

If the premise sounds appealing to you, you will enjoy the game and it is worth the price of admission. It's very well done.\n\nHowever, it is early access, and as such, there are a lot of missing functions, some balance issues, bugs, and a lack of content which appears to be in the process of being addressed. My biggest concern at the moment, in terms of "I want to have fun right now," is the lack of tooltip details.\n\nLet me explain. You get choices on which weapons/abilities to load your ship with. However, there is absolutely zero description of what any of the weapons do aside from the name. So you kind of have to try them all and figure out how they're supposed to work.  Yes, this will obviously be addressed, but in the game's current state, there's sort of an unnecessarily high learning curve.\n\nStill, once I figured things out, I started having a ton of fun, and I'm glad I paid the $10. I'm having fun finding new ways to sneak up on enemies and blow them to pieces.","January 29, 2015","true","18.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Games last about 20ish minutes as death timers on respawns increase rapidly.  The tutorial is pretty lengthy and explains a lot, but you really have to play to learn.\n\nOverall Pros:\nGreat graphics\nSeems pretty balanced ship-wise so far\nPlenty of room for macro and micro strategy\nPlenty of unique abilities to outfit your ship with\nNOT pay to win.

With no way to see server ping before joining i couldnt find one suitable to my specific area ("U.S. east" is not helpful at all). Made hitting anything a guessing game.\n-The play area is tiny. For being a game with apparently infinite amounts of space, the actually space used by players (including snipers) wasnt very much, making mid-range ships that much more effective.\n-As a level 6 sniper i was taking twice as much damage from a level 7 sniper even as he was under fire from another ship. There are clear balancing issues that need to be addressed.\n-There is some system by which parts of your ship become damaged and either retreating or turning your ship becomes necessary, but how this works and in what way is beyond me. There is no explination in-game.\n-The crew members ramblings became a burden and i quickly jettisoned them.\n-Their bodies did NOT slow the enemy.\n-half the abilites seemed to do nothing. In cases where i used a weapon and it did little to no damage, maybe a message explaining the effective range of the weapon is in order?\n-You cant change your ship mid-game. So once you get into a game and realize the ship you picked is a floating crap-pile, you are stuck with it the entire game. Have fun being a burden to the rest of your team.\n-hate to bring this up but THERE IS NO AIR IN SPACE. having the ships slow to a stop once i cease using thrusters is not realistic nor fun. Too many space games do this and i find it annoying even if they have a plot device for it. (at least have it as an option you can deactivate or a "full stop" button you can key bind)\n-warping is a mess. you can WARP! (yay!) but only to this square foot or this square foot. (boo!) (you are forced to warp into a specific area, meaning enemies know where to look to ambush you.) you are also locked out of certain destinations if you dont own the arrival base, making coming up behind your enemy impossible.\n\n\nThings to improve:\n-The large shields attached to the A1/A2/B1/B2 stations should be destructable. In fact, everything should have HP and could potentially be destroyed given enough firepower.\n-allow free ship movement. having "up" as always "up" isnt what space is about and limits the creativity of the player.\n-put rams on the damn ships already. i want to penetrate things.\n-maybe a mode by which multiple players control one ship (pilot, gunner, etc.)\n-at least a couple of the weapons didnt have a form of targeting. for a game set really far in the future, i find it silly that anyone would go into combat with "fire and forget" weapons willingly.\n-fix warping. maybe make a ship type (scout?) that can warp anywhere? or just remove the current limitations.\n-give the smaller bases some kind of defenses, even if its basic guns. its too easy to flood a side.\n-limit the number of each ship type per team until the balancing issues are addressed\n-increase overall ship shields by 20-40% until connection issues are fixed. the buffer will help players survive those nasty lag spikes.\n\ntl;dr: skip it and revisit once its release.","January 30, 2015","false","14.8"," 47 of 87 people (54%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","54","47","87","15","8"

This game is in early access it has a lot of issues and it still has a long way to go before it can reach its final stages. This game at its current stage is a moba since its only mode is for each team to try to capture certain areas until they are able to capture the opposing teams base, hopefully they will add more modes like an all out war.\n\nThere is hope for this game to be successful as long as the developers use their skills and experience that they acquired from developing Strike Suit Zero.","November 21, 2014","true","9.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Let me also say that it is currently day two of alpha early access, and we've already seen SUBSTANTIAL polish with a patch.\n\nI first heard about Fractured Space by watching a video on Youtube from The Mighty Jingles.  If you haven't already seen it, it's definitely worth a watch.  The dev team behind this game is a hard working machine.  I've been a part of several different alpha tests/early accesses, and I've never seen a dev team put together a patch on day two.  To drive my point home, the newest expansion for Warcraft just dropped, and they're STILL having problems, and Blizzard has an almost infinite number of resources throw at its problems.\n\nAll of that being said, if you're a fan of DOTA-types or World of Tanks/War Thunder, then this game will be a definite download.\n\nHowever...\n\nThere are still currently a lot of bugs.  A LOT OF THEM.  I have been playing off-and-on since official early access release last night, and I've only been able to fully complete one match.  This is the nature of the beast when signing on not only to any early access game, but especially one that is this young.  I knew it was going to be like this going in, so please don't take this as a complaint.  The game is MAGNIFICENT.  The gameplay is fantastic, and tactics and patience are well rewarded.\n\nSo, should you buy into the early access?  Only if you want to support the dev team as they continue development.  If you are easily frustrated by constant game crashes and unbalanced powersets, then please wait until the game has been developed further.  Also, if you just want to pay to be able to play the game early, you should probably rethink your decision.  I would, at this time, only recommend this game to people who genuinely enjoy testing games in early alpha and having their voices heard by the dev team in order to enhance further development.","November 21, 2014","true","6.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Though I've had a few crashes, the gameplay to me is solid. A basic way to explain my experience so far is equivalating this game to rock-paper-scissors in space. Of course its a whole lot more fun than I just made it sound. Starting out with the Assassin, I was happy the ship played more or less as its name implies; cloak and ambushing.\n\nTo describe one of the few rounds I played, I jumped to a nearby area in conflict. Near the opposite end on their side, they had a sniper picking at us from afar. I started to flank, weaving in and out of the asteroids while trying to maintain my cloak until I snuck up on the occupied sniper, point jumped to him while cloaked, lasered him with the ambush skill, and unleashed havoc on him. Up to this point, allied ships were able to break through the enemy and we continued to assault their base.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend supporting these devs, they're doing some great work and I hope to see more.","January 31, 2015","true","1.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

There should be some defensive stations on asteroids, the stations themselves or on satillites that should attack you.\n-No evacuating your ship option. I think if we are about to blow up, we should be allowed to evacuate our ship and decrease our respawn time.\n\n-Sniper class is the least useful unless all you want to do is get assists and deaths. Maybe I'm a bad Sniper in this game? But one play through left the worst taste in my mouth. Long range combat isn't very engaging or rewarding, so I'm sticking to close/medium range.\n\nConclusion:\n\n-Despite the longer list of neutral or bad, you must understand. A lot of that will probably be addressed sooner or later.\n\n\nPersonal Story:\n\nI decided to pick this game up today and was surprised how much I enjoyed playing it.\n\nThe most epic, yet traumatic moment I've had so far was when I finished capturing an enemy base. I spotted a weakened enemy vessel and I went ahead to pursue it in my Enforcer when I heard more enemies are arriving! I glanced to my left and saw four.. yes.. FOUR enemy ships warp in. I said, "Oh F$%^ me!" and I was dead in seconds, haha!\n\nDespite my most epic moment was me being destroyed, I only went -2.. With 5 deaths and 3 kills.

Kirk keeps giving suggestions to the new Captain about how to rescue the stranded vessels, but major components won't be installed until Tuesday......this is a lot like that. Still, I've enjoyed the game enough I thought I should write a short review of what you can expect so far.\n\nThe combat is great! Each ship varies in its armament, capabilities and how it's most effective. You can hop in a quick and agile frigate and dart in between asteroids and make quick hit runs against a slow moving Flagship or man a giant rail gun and smash ships all the way across the map. There is enough variety between the ships, that each offers its own experience.\n\nRemember the 2009 Star Trek? When the Enterprise first encounters the mining vessel and ♥♥♥♥ really goes down? Phasers and torpedoes flying everywhere, pieces of hull flying off into space. That's what this game feels like. When you execute your strategy perfectly and unleash hell on your enemy, chewing away a good portion of his hull....Sweet Baby Jesus it's awesome.\n\nThe game play is great. I've not played DOTA, but I understand it's similar in objectives. There are a few key points you should try to cap, with the ultimate objective being the capture of your enemy's gate that leads to their home base. It's set up in a way that forces you to think tactically and you'll have to work as a team to push in strategic areas. As you collects key resource points, your ships get stronger and stronger, as they tier up.\n\nOf course, there is a lot missing, but that comes with the territory of an Early Access game.\n\n\n\n\n","February 19, 2015","true","50.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It's a fairly pretty game; It's not EVE ONLINE pretty, but there are some gems: the the added detail of explosions and fires across your hull where you have taken damage is a nice touch, textures for ammunition and weapons is a treat for the eyes and the lighting is superb. The gameplay itself is straightforward anything but convoluted. controls accurately depict what youre trying to do: fly a massive spacehulk with the precision of needling a thread. It's easy to pick up, but difficult to master. most ships are balanced and fun to play, offering different aspects to take advantage of or to be cautious.

Please realize, before you buy. This game is in a infant state.\n\nThanks.\n\n\nEarly Access Thoughts:\n\nI must say that I have participated in a few Early Access games. For the amount of content that is available, at this very moment, is already worth my 10$.\n\n1: Detail\nAlready in its early state, Fractured Space has some good eye candy. There is some things that are placeholders, Im sure. But, so far, it is very nice looking. The ship explosions are some of the best I have seen for a space game. It looks just as I would think a explosion in space would look like. The asteroids look quite well done. (I am hoping that the "Main Base" doest stay like it is. Looks more like a fighting ring, than a "main Base"..lol)\n\n2: Ships\nThey are going for more of a team play mechanic. So you have your Heavy, Med, and Light crafts. Then you have some different "Roles" tied into the ships as well. From a sniper, to a close up "run and gunner". Plus there is support class ships. Like a healer, and one that can disable a enemy. Very versitile, and logical, how the dev's have planed so far.\n\n3: Game Play\nYou have two teams. Fighting for control of Five "Sectors". (Which is quite large) Two "Home Bases", that are the "Primary" capture point.\nThe ships fly by using w/a/s/d/q/e.(sitting still will get you killed..lol) Space bar will raise you, while CTRL will lower you. You aim, zoom in(like ADS), and scroll in and out to zoom, with your mouse. There is a health bar on the Hud, around the cursor/reticle. Your abilites are on the numbers. You hold shift to pick a near jumpoint. (The animation for the jump does need some work. Which Im sure that they will) Some ships cature points quicker than others. So finding the right balance for your play still shouldn't be too hard.\n\nNow, In these five sectors of the map;\n\nThere are "mines" to capture in the two lanes of alpha and beta sectors, which in turn will add "resources " for your team. These resources  will compile, and add the ability to upgrade your ships damage/defence/mobility/and capture rate. The more resources a team has, the more upgrades to the teams ships. (So capture those points!!)\n\nThere are four main points of capture, in alpha and beta secors.(On each side of the map) With three mines in both sectors. One large "Gas Plant" in the very middle. It is "Gamma" Sector. (But on the map, it is C, not G..bugs me..lol)\nThe gas plant does not come online untill 10 min of the match has past. And two main bases at the very top and bottom.\n\nI'll be honest, I don't know if it's possible to win by resources, or points. But, I do know that capture the enemies base will win the match.\n\nUI: Can be a pain a little. But seeing how "new" this is, I did expect worse. It isnt that it is placed in a wrong spot. But, for instance; When fighting, my abilites are on the numbers 1-7(I think..lol could be 8) Anyway, I want to keep flying, to make myself a harder target, and trying to do that, aim and shoot, then hit an ability without letting off the throttle, can be a pain..lol (To be fair, I cant think of it being much different. Untill we can set buttons to what we want.)\n\nThere is very little else I can say, as there isn't much in it at the moment.\nBut, if you like sci-fi, and space shooters. Then, this one is going to be good when finished. And, if you like to "alpha test", then you should go ahead and spend the 10. Either way, you can get 10$ worth of fun out of it, in its alpha state. In my oppinion, of couse.\n\n[EDIT: 10/05/2016]\n\nI wrote this review back in 2014, December I think. I quit playing for a while to let things get fleshed out a bit. Now, it has been 4 days since I reinstalled the game. Each day, I don't have a lot of game time, I have checked to see if I can get a match in. So far, the longest that I waited was 7min. And, over the last 4 days, the most people I have seen online playing, was around 200 people. So, Im a bit disappointed to see this after a year.\n\nThey have changed the way you get into a match now, by using some match maker system. A year ago, you could look through a server list and choose a server. Now, you are placed into a que. I have yet to get into a match. And, I do admit, I refuse to wait longer than 5 minutes. (I did wait 7 min. 2 days ago, by accident. Surfing, while waiting...) Like I said, I dont have a lot of gaming time, lately. So, I will leave my "recommendation", but I  would wait and see if they start getting a player base back, before buying into this title right now. The waiting times are just too long to be enjoyable, atm...","December 8, 2014","true","35.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

What all those Star Trek ship battle games should have been!!!  Imagine a starship with 5000 crew, and each ship specifically outfitted with unique technologies that makes you invaluable on the battlefield and fits your own playing style.  Again, wow!  I'm impressed.  I haven't had this much fun with a space game since Wing Commander.  When I fire the guns on a ship called "The Enforcer", I feel like I just fired the phasers of the Enterprise (new version).\n\nTo be honest, I have favored single-player games more than online multiplayer, but this game has helped win me over.  And, you don't have to be an expert to make a valuable contribution to your team!  When you work with the team, you help the team.  Sometimes it can get a bit frustrating playing with noobs, but I have to laugh when I see them do the same things I used to do.\n\nYes, the devs are really on track with this game, but keep in mind, it is still in early development.  Some of the changes that have been made are a matter of taste, but it certainly becomes more interesting as the devs add more and more features.\n\nI can see Fractured Space becoming one of the best space games of all time.  I enjoy playing this like I enjoy Risk.  It involves much more strategy than just blowing stuff up, but when you do blow up another capital ship be prepared for the best effects that I've seen in any space game.","January 3","true","320.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

When I got into a match I learned it was fun, very, very fun. Because it is a 3D map and you can ravel up and down you will find yourself getting ambushed from above and then doing the youself. The ships look amazing and some of there abilitys look epic. There are some ships witch are just point and click but the ones that requir more thinking of what you are going to do and some expirience will realy turn the tide of battle. The tech tree and reaserching isn't implemented yet so everything is instantly unlocked but that doesn't won't realy play a role in gameplay because no one weapon is any better than another.\n\nPros- Very fun, many kinds of capital ships to fly, and gameplay never gets old.\n-Easy to learn, you may feel like a noob at first but you will et the hang of it.\n-Well ballanced, No one ship can single handedly win a battle.\n-Well optimized, I don't often have lag even on my slower laptop.\n-Wonderfull graphics, the ships are very detailed and you know they put in a lo of effort.\n\nCons- Small commmuntiy, at the moment there will only be a few servers with people on them and you will find youself with the same people game after game.\n-Same map, there is currently only one map to play on and I hope they ad more.\n\nOverall this game 9/10, I realy recomend it.","March 1, 2015","true","69.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

First off, the graphics are incredibly beautiful.  I have played a ton of space games for the longest time (Freelancer, DarkStar One, Elite: Dangerous, Star Citizen, Etc.) and this game tops all of them in terms of ship design and textures.  The explosions, ship fires, and weapon trails look gorgeous whilst for the ships themselves, their aesthetic is unique and alluring. Secondly, the gameplay is fun.  It's simple and easy to pick up, but so very hard to master.  It is much slower than many modern "action games" but that doesn't mean that it can't have a frantic space battle in the midst of a match.  If you only like doing 720noscopes#420blazeit, this game is not for you as trying to do a 720° turn in the middle of battle will A) Take 5 minutes and B) Undoubtedly get you killed.  If you, however, enjoy space, enjoy 5v5 strategy (Moba), enjoy fighting in humongous capital ships with ~2,000 people on board (All of whom die if you explode), and enjoy yelling "Ludicrous Speed!" when hitting the "Boost" button on your ship, this game is for you (No joke, that crap flies fast).\n\nNotes:\n-This game is in Early Access and currently unavailable unless you buy a Founder's Pack. HOWEVER, it will be free to play when it releases. It is in no way (I mean it. In NO WAY AT ALL.) a Pay to Win. You can't even buy ships you haven't unlocked with XP with money. And you only earn XP by playing.\n-There are some occasional matchmaking bugs, but that doesn't detract much from the whole experience.  The devs know about the bugs and are working to fix them. But, let's be real, if you win a 4v5, you feel pretty freaking awesome, so don't be afraid to try (You do get a 30% respawn timer cut).\n-The community is small (~300ish people on at any given time) but the game is not dead.  As previously mentioned, it is in EARLY ACCESS and unaccessible unless you have the game already/bought a Founder's Pack.  That will change once it becomes a F2P.\n-There is a bit of a grind to get some higher tier ships, but that doesn't mean that the "higher tier" ships are any better than the starter ships.  The game is actually incredibly balanced (Not perfect, but few things are), and playing with the starter ships is completely viable even in higher level matches.  The other ships are not better at all, they are simply different.\n-NOT P2W.\n-Ugh I can't get over how beautiful this game is.\n\nTL;DR - Game is beautiful, fun, balanced, free (soon) and not P2W.  Few matchmaking bugs hurt a tiny bit, but they're already known and being worked on.","April 25","true","79.8"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","2"

The developers are very passionate about their virtual lovechild that is Fractured space. What they pretend not to see is that it's severely crippled and doesn't do a very good job at school.\n\nFractured space is and has been dying at alarming rates(yes I'm aware it's early access but that doesn't mean that the playerbase can die out and that it wouldn't be a bad omen). The forum has some very dedicated users that are basically ignored by the developers as they continue to add new fancy spaceships to throw them on the incoherent pile of junk they refuse to fix.\n\nFractured space is downright boring. It's a moba game without any interesting mechanics other than the ships themselves. It has no customization(apart from the "crew", but their bonusses are absolutely neglectable ingame) and unlocking new ships takes hours of playing. On top of that "playing" is a big word as finding a game takes a very very long time. The only reason I played this game for as long as I did is because I really want to like it, the idea is there but the developers have no idea what they're doing or where they want to go with it.\n\nUnless you absolutely love spacegames/ships avoid at all costs.

The space combat is fun and easy to learn, the visuals of the ships are amazing even though the astroid and space stations textures aren't the best its not a final product.

And that sucks. You can't change class during a battle, and respawns will see you sitting on the benches for a minute or more. The biggest holes though are in the gameplay; backdooring is far too easy, it being possible to storm and then capture the enemy base before they can even warp back to give any fight. That's fine in an organised match, but in pub games it's a deal breaker. I hope Edge Case doesn't fall into the trap of thinking that doesn't matter. This should all change though with some jump option tweaking and once base AI defences are working.\nThe magic is there. Games are tense and fun with good scope for depth of tactics.. if you can get over the cointoss outcomes.

The more points you capture the more resources you gain per second, and resources mean upgrades to your ships health and damage, giving you advantage over  the enemy ships. Currently you can choose between 15 or something ships (but this is still alpha, more ships to come for sure), you got  tanky ships, high damage ships, long range ships, close range attack ships, assasin ship (like you go in stealth mode, pop up next to enemy ship, do a lot of damage and then get the hell out of there), support ships (repair yourself and allies, or increase damage done on enemy ships for you and your allies.) and some mixed ships that have a little of everything.\n\nI can only say that i've liked this game so far, there are some downsides like laggy servers ( like 1 in 5 games for me are laggy, and 1 in 15 or so is like almost unplayable due to lagg), but that is what you get when you play alpha release. other downside is that currently it is impossible to change the controls for the game (unless you alter some files) which is really anoying if you are one of the few people (belgium,france, ...) that use AZERTY keyboards, because the controls are for QWERTY which means you control the ships movement with ZQSD instead of WSAD. You can fix this by pressing alt+Lshift to switch your keyboard to qwerty mode, but than you will not be able to type properly.\n\nAll in all, great game, I am sure they will fix these problems in the near future, and when the game goes full release there will most likely be more ships and maps  and modes to play.\n\nI rate it  7.5/10","April 21, 2015","true","20.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

What's in the game (as of the time of writing) is phenomenal, but one can't help shake the feeling that it's an empty frame - beautifully crafted - waiting for something to fill the void.\n\nHowever, do not take this as a negative. The relatively small amount of content that exists in the game is still enough to keep a player occupied! Upgrade costs are balanced in such a way that players can look forward to tweaking their loadout with a new gimmick after every match, or hold out for a few more and get an entirely new ship.\n\nWith a pace that shifts from relaxed to blistering at a moment's notice, the game itself is stunning, breathtaking, and incredibly fun to play. There's something magical about drifting in calm silence to let your ship repair one moment, then warping in to a hurricane of shrapnel and broadside fire the next. Fractured Space truly captures the mix of nerve-wracking tactics and frenetic action that real space combat would be - and wraps it up in an intuitive, easy-to-learn package.\n\nThe assets are absolutely gorgeous and the atmosphere is incredibly well thought-out. Ship design seems to take cues from modern popular Sci-Fi as well as the classic Hard Science Fiction of the 20th century.

Controlling stations gains you resources which level your team up, the more stations you control on the map, the faster you level, which in turn strengthens your teams ships. However, killing isn't the goal in this game, rather the capture of enemy forward bases to open the way for your team to capture their home base. Capturing stations will net you more resources, but also will signal to the enemy which sectors you're advancing on and where they should divert more ships to counter.\n\nThere's a small series of tutorial missions that will enable you to get a sense of the basic mechanics of the game and how to move about, but it's up to you to get an idea of the tactics and strategy. There's currently three factions of ships, each with their own unique classes and abilities, so there's plenty of variety in the different ship classes, and there is also the chance to further tweak your ships through the uses of different crews and weapons.\n\nThe game is slated to become Free-to-Play when it exits Early Access (may even be free now, not 100% sure) but, assuming there aren't any significant tweaks to the EXP and Credit rewards, the spectre of 'grind' doesn't seem to loom heavily as I've managed, as a rookie, to get around 1k of experience each game, making new ships availible every dozen games or so depending on my performance. Money will help unlock things faster, but the only things money can exclusively buy amount mostly to new skins for ships.\n\nIt also helps that it scratches that capital ship itch. You know the one, the desire to maneuver a massive ship to bring an earth-shattering arsenal to bear on the enemy...","February 3","true","6.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I agree with other reviewer's comment on this, its like a spaceship MOBA.  I particuarly enjoyed the art direction on the ships as well as the lumbering manueverability during gameplay.  It really gives you a sense of the massiveness of the boats.  Lastly, I hope they keep skins as the only thing that costs money to avoid PTW.\n\nAlso particularly interesting is how the "classes" are essentially divided based on ship size, manueverability, and specific CDs.  What sets this apart is the 3-dimensional aspect of each engagement.\n\nGiven that its still in Alpha, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on the following.\n1) Optimization\n2) Lag spikes in game\n3) Connectivity issue into matches\n4) No complete texture on most stationary objects.\n\nWhat I'd like to see more of, personally, are as follows:\n1) Larger teams, 5v5 seems too small... 10v10 sounds awesome, with bigger maps.\n2) A slighter further zoom on the ship\n3) Better effects on CQC type weapons\n4) More game modes\n5) More non-interactive background battles in some of these maps for immersion.\n6) More customization on loadout (Think MechWarrior Online)\n7) A grander conflict to engage community to work towards something other than just a grind.\n8) It be awesome if EVE was like this =)\n\nWill buy again for sure.\n\n\n","January 31","true","6.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Yes.\nIs it worth money? Depends.\nThe game is an early access version of what will eventually be a free to play game, with a tech tree similar to the likes of War Thunder or World of Tanks. However, it throws away the tiers, and instead balances all ships together into one matchmaking block, similar to Mechwarrior Online. It's enjoyable for a while, but the grind begins to get excessive. The good news is that you're not going to need to worry about repairs or ammo costs, which eliminates a point of stress in the grinding.\nThe graphics are also absolutely beautiful. Unreal Engine 4 is put to the max, and boy does it look good. The ships also are interestingly designed.\nThe game has two modes - a TDM style mode, and a capture the base mode. Both are enjoyable, but something like this could really use some more modes to keep its longevity.\nAnd now, onto the negatives. These modes won't keep your attention forever, and you'll quickly want more. The various classes of ships give a huge variety of playstyles, but again - you will be grinding a while to get a ship you may or may not like. UNLESS, of course, you decide to throw money at premium currency, in which case you can push to that ship faster, and this is a bit of a problem... unless you've snagged the game on a free-forever weekend, you've already tossed money at the game, and now they are asking for more money via microtransactions. This however, is only a temporary problem, since the game needn't be bought once it gets released.\nThere also are major server issues, despite there only being a peak of about 1000 players online IN THE WORLD. Half the matches I'm in, I'll get severe lag stutters that are serverside, not on my end.\nFinal thoughts - I'd suggest you DEFINITELY get the game on one if its free-forever weekends. It'll definitely net you enough enjoyment to be worth the download.

People need to hold and push down (space)lanes acordingly, capture resource points to then acuire upgrades for their ships. Once your teams ships are strong enough to take on the enemies final base a window must be seized, perhaps when some enemies are respawning.\n\nIt's a great game requiring tactics, teamwork, patience and planning. Shame the only people I come across seem to be incapable of understanding this. Bunch up and rush down one lane seems to be the only play most seem to know. If both blobs pick oposite lanes, whoever reaches the end base first wins only after doing this twice. If both blobs meet they fight, the blobs will then reform and repeat. The most excruciating part though, is waiting for a game.\n\nI recomend this though, in the hopes that one day enough tacticly minded people will play this beautiful game and I'll start having some really good edge of the command seat capital battles.","April 25","true","62.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/prince24earth/recommended/310380/","prince24earth","Kochupata","http://steamcommunity.com/id/prince24earth/","5 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is basically  MOBA based on space combat. I'm playing this 4 days long now and I can say that I never get bored. The game is run by Unreal Engine 4, so details are awesome. Sometime I just love sit   watching jump animation of the ships. Can't complain about the gameplay too. I'm cheating on War Thunder( I'm typical war thunder player) but I've no regrets. I think I'm falling in love all over again. If you want to feel something new and fresh too, then welcome to Fractured Space!\n\nThere's two battlemodes as developers promised, but only one is playble as the game is in alpha phase.\nThere's three kind of ships - Attack, Defence and Support, three fractions(actually ships  builders) - USR(United Space Research), Zarek and Titan DS.\n\nWhen I joined this game I though it's just typical space combat game with small spacecrafts, but be alerted, this game is about spaceships. Some people like fun shooter where they take a space fighter and keeping shooting around until match is ended, this game isn't for them. You have to keep your perception focused, because otherwise you would get defeated easily. You have to keep track of your map, ship and other players. If you compare it to Dota, you're going on right path.\n\nThere's only single map on current game mode ; Five possible 'fractured' sectors -  you can jump to, Two home bases, Two side sectors - Alpha and Beta, One combat buff - Gamma, it's the center of the whole map.\nYou would spawn on home base and can jump to Alpha, Beta or Gamma. Alpha - Beta got mine stations to capture. Capturing gives your team upgrade points, which you use to upgrade your ship in game. Oh I forgot, which by the way is really an important thing. Alpha - Beta got  forwading staions for each team. You have to capture one of them in order to access enemy base. Now, Gamma opens each 4 minutes. You can capture it in order to help team upgrade points. Home bases are ring shaped with defensive cannons and healing buoy for it's  team. In order to capture enemy base, you need get inside the base(to the center of the ring). Base shoots shells to you so, it's better to bring team members with you.\n\nOne good thing about game is - every ship is balaced in Attack and Defense, which means every ship can kill each other ; but don't know about Gladiotor, defense ship from Zarek, probably the best ship in game. Each ship have three main feature - Attack, Defense and Equipment, there's rating for this features, you have to choose ship by judging it. You need to assign a crew list to start playing PvP. I was stuck at that for some moment, so thought to share this on.\n\npros:\n- balanced ships\n- cool detailed graphics\n- independent game mode to try each ship against each ship\n- popular global servers to match make, e.g. EU, NA, SEA.\n- non-toxic community(currently)\n- free to play - as per,  may,2016 announcement\n- you can win every match without spending a penny\n- open development\n- simple UI, options and controls, supportive for beginners\n- MMR based matchmaking\n- relatively small download size (~ 3gb)\n\ncons:\n- only available in PC (currently)\n- playerbase too small, sometime had to wait 3minutes find a match\n- takes time to load\n- no singleplayer campaign\n- only one game mode available currently(actually it isn't a con)\n-  that's all!\n\nNote: there's no explicit button for chat-to-all. you can use, right shift + enter or press enter then click left ctrl.\nNote: Upgrading points can be used only to upgrade team ships, nor team base neither captured stations.","June 2","true","26.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

After a couple updates there are a ton of ships now with only the one sniper being incredibly annoying to fight against as it can tick off half the health of most ships from accross the map. The game has gotten another game mode that is a little more singular but more modes could help.\n\nSo long as you have a decent game you can earn a new ship regularly and there is a shared exp system for factions that is for both ships and ship upgrades. Unfortunately the one thing i usually run low on in between upgrades and ships is in game currency which is earned at a slower rate than exp and is slightly earned differently somehow. Honestly the attachment of currancy seems more like licking at the coattails at more established games, mainly other mobas and the only other need for it is getting crew which is permanent status adjustments in lew of the normal in game status adjustments which is replaced with just normal leveling dictated by a team shared resource system. meaning its harder to carry a team as you are always the same level as your allies even if your the only person working towards winning.\n\nthe only real reason i cant really recommend the game is the stupid prices of the premium content. 15 dollars for a skin is rediculous. the game is 10 how can it be suggested that 15 is a good price for a model changing skin. pallet swaping skins are still only 5 so thats still silly. 5 dollars is #1000 premium currancy and buys 1 #990 palletswap skin or 9 sets of 4 #110 boosters. so the boostes may be worth it but its a little weird that you will always have a few bits of currancy left over. also as far as i can tell 1 booster is 1 match so if this is your game of choice you will end up burning through them.","February 15, 2015","true","68.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It wasn't the Dev's fault really. It was the fault of people who like to stack the odds in their favor by stacking their teams. The amount these Devs work on trying to make this the most balanced space PvP Arena out there shows they know what their game's weakness is and they really want it to be a great experience everytime. I was tempted to give a bad review but I have waited and over the last 6 months and I have seen a laser sharp focus on matchmaking so I am giving them a good review.

For an alpha game, the graphics on the ships are flawless, and trust me, only having 1 map doesn't make the game tedious since the fun doesn't come from pretty scenery, it comes from great plays and battles. It's a complicated rock-papers-scissors that requires coordination and strategy even if the idea is simple.\n\nMy only gripe is the tech and upgrade trees, how one has to unlock a certain ship or ability when their end goal is a different ship or ability. The ships and abilities are sidegrades anyways, fitting your playstyle so why not be able to directly unlock the ship/ability you want?\n\nOverall, a wonderful game that's only going to get better.

Very clunky and slow, there are seemingly drastic power differences between ships, and the loadout upgrades feel underwhelming/not compeling.\nThe servers and game itself seem to have a bit of lag to them as well, even on a machine that far surpases the tech specs for the game.\nStill strangely fun though. Think MOBA in space, but not like you would a normal MOBA. Much of the skill elements involved in MOBA games are removed, especially reactive skill simply because the game is seemingly designed around being large, slow, clunky space ships.

Each ship is unique and has its strengths and weaknesses, and any ship that is to overpowered will be nerfed to a degree to keep it in line with other ships. (though in my opnion the flagship should be made stronger) While there are still a few bugs to be worked out the rate in which these are fixed the game will be nearly complete. Though the current 5v5 is alright it would be cool to see more players per a match to get real fleet vs fleet combat going. The action of deep space combat is really brought to life in this game where the capital ships actually have weight behind them, either your crusing down the center of a lane in a flagship, or darting around the astroids in a frigate all of it feels very realistic. If you love star wars, star trek ship combat then this is the game for you.

Very clunky and slow, there are seemingly drastic power differences between ships, and the loadout upgrades feel underwhelming/not compeling.\nThe servers and game itself seem to have a bit of lag to them as well, even on a machine that far surpases the tech specs for the game.\nStill strangely fun though. Think MOBA in space, but not like you would a normal MOBA. Much of the skill elements involved in MOBA games are removed, especially reactive skill simply because the game is seemingly designed around being large, slow, clunky space ships. The only near exception to this would be the blink ability (flash from LoL) available to some ships.\nRecommended.

Yes.\nAre there some bugs? Probably, but I can't find them at the moment.\nDo I like this game? Yes.\n\n(TL:DR or if you just don't want to read it: This game is awesome, get it.)\n\nFacts about the game:\nIt's in development. You can vote on the things that go into the game. (Heck yes)\nBasically the whole game revolves around capital ship combat. Each ship has specific bonuses that allow players to have different playstyles. If you try to have a playstyle that doesn't fit your ship, it wont take too long to see it. Trial and error is one of your best friends in this game. Don't be worried about losing ships at the start. (However, each time you lose a ship in game increases the respawn time - up to a point) Also, don't worry about losing a game. No matter what, you gain experience and credits. Experience in a specific company's ships allows you to spend those experience points to unlock more advanced ships from that manufacturer. Now there are also ship loadouts that you can modify, which also cost manufacturer experience to unlock, and credits to buy. Once again, it's another way to tweak your ship to fit your exact playstyle.\n\nI really REALLY like this game, and am excited to see where it's going to go. I like being able to see the development progress before my eyes and see the awesomeness unfold. There's a lot of players for something in the alpha stage, and I can always find people online. It does have a bit of a steep learning curve, especially if you don't look at the controls.","April 28, 2015","true","9.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Definately recommend this game to anyone who likes space.\nI do think there needs to be some changes to HP for some ships, especially the cloaked ships and sniper.  A ship that has devestating alpha, can cloak, has decent speed, and 2000 more base HP than the fast ships that would be hunting them seems slightly unbalanced to me.  Don't get me wrong, I love playing them but they are just don't have enough weaknesses for the role they are filling.\nSniper ship also needs less HP and its guns should have slower movement(not too much slower but a sniper shouldnt be able to follow a frigate 5km away(and to the side) and hit every time.  Think a tank destroyer in world of tanks vs a fast medium or light.  They can hit but it's much harder.\nI think the Carrier damage rating should be reduced 1 point as well.  It really is more of a support/defensive ship and even in close range with max upgrades(vs a max upgrade opponent) it doesnt seem to match the offensive output indicated by its rating.  Just to be clear, I think the damage is fine(but I wouldn't complain if there were a few more bombers per wing) but that it doesn't seem to meet the current offensive rating from what I've found.\nThese current specs are not game breaking by any means and pilot skill usually always wins but I do feel these are relatively easy fixes that would help game balance.","August 16, 2015","true","138.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

As it is a team based "Control Point" style game you require team effort and support from other players on your side, tactics are an important part of the game and the worst thing you can do is follow your team into the enemy base and get yourself killed!\n\nI'm going to do a serious review on this because I actually like this game!\n\nWhat is Fractured Space?Fractured Space is a team-based space combat game with a lot like the "Control Points" gamemode from TF2, the ships themselves in the game are based around Capital Ships for example, Frigates, Cruisers, Battleships and the things you see a lot in Sci-Fi games. The ships feel large and weighty in space (even though there is no gravity) and they are slow to control, just like a large capital ship would feel like (If you catch my drift!) The aim of the game is to work as a team based fleet and capture control points A1/A2 or B1/B2 to make your way to the enemy base, though Beware! The enemy will try to do the same, the combat in the game makes it epic and this game, though in early access is very promising and is definitely going in the right direction!\nWith 3 starting ships, you fight to earn XP and different Corporation style currencies to upgrade your ship or buy your own! (More on the 3 types of ship later)\n\nPros\nCombat System\nThe Combat system in this game fits well with the style of the game.\nThe Capital Ships in the game feel, fly and fight like capital ships!\nThere are many different capital ships in the game with different classes, Corvette, Assault, Flagship, Support, etc.\nThe different ships have they're own classes! Corvette for support, Flagship for Defence/Mid-Assault and Frigate for Frontline assault.\nThe combat is competitive.\nEach ship has custom abilities from Launching Missiles and disabling beams to Hanger based defenses for launching fighters and drones.\nDifferent skins for different ships.\nDifferent crew members which add extra things to some stats.\nConsIt does have some pay to win features, which I dislike, a lot. (Not the actual P2W features but the fact it has P2W anyway) So the Pay to win isn't really much in this game, it mainly includes extra skins for your ships and extra crew.\nThere is an in-game upgrade system, I don't know anything about it/how to use it other than "It makes the Rich Richer and the Poor Poorer" essentially means that it gives your team/enemy teams better buffs for some ships, making the games quite unfair.\n"Requires agreement to a 3rd-party EULA" Now This... This is something I do not like in a game, I hate it honestly, I understand it allows a set up for an account, but if the register sites servers are down then you cannot register and cannot play, also it Takes Time out of your excitement when you want to play this game, So you better have an email address ready!\nThis might just be me but being in Europe, and playing in Europe servers I still get quite High Ping, so did my friends and some of their friends when we last played some games of it.\nCan be grindy at times but that's only if you want upgrades/currency, and to get that you have to get kills so if your bad at this game your kinda Screwed!\nSo should I buy this game?\nWell that depends! If you like the sound of playing a space shooter based upon larger ships instead of fighters then Go for it! but if you don't fancy it then don't bother! Personally, I think you should buy this game, Perhaps £6.99 is a bit steep for some people but for me it seems perfectly reasonable.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nBuy this Game!\n","April 29, 2015","true","7.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

For an alpha game, the graphics on the ships are flawless, and trust me, only having 1 map doesn't make the game tedious since the fun doesn't come from pretty scenery, it comes from great plays and battles. It's a complicated rock-papers-scissors that requires coordination and strategy even if the idea is simple.\n\nMy only gripe is the tech and upgrade trees, how one has to unlock a certain ship or ability when their end goal is a different ship or ability. The ships and abilities are sidegrades anyways, fitting your playstyle so why not be able to directly unlock the ship/ability you want?\n\nOverall, a wonderful game that's only going to get better.

It wasn't the Dev's fault really. It was the fault of people who like to stack the odds in their favor by stacking their teams. The amount these Devs work on trying to make this the most balanced space PvP Arena out there shows they know what their game's weakness is and they really want it to be a great experience everytime. I was tempted to give a bad review but I have waited and over the last 6 months and I have seen a laser sharp focus on matchmaking so I am giving them a good review.

Recommend trying this out to any who enjoy tactical play over faster reaction times and pinpoint accuracy. It's very possible to have a favorable outcome even in a 4v5 matchup.","February 13","true","32.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You win the game by capturing the enemy base and you can jump to it only from a lane with point thats closer to oponents base captured.\n\nHangar, tech tree:\nYes, there is tech tree here. After winning or loosing the game, you're awarded with 2 types of resources (i cant remember the names). Like in WoT and other games of that kind you use one to research an item and the other to purchase it afterwards. Ships are unlocked and upgraded the same way.\n\nShips:\nThere are few ship "classes" and few manufacturers. All of the ships are usefull in their own way and incredibly balanced, they are not all the same.\n\nGraphics:\nIts detailed and beautiful along with the explosions, allthough the stars and a planet in the background are low resolution (my settings are at ultra) and asteroids on one of the lanes look like melted chocolate, im not joking.\n\nIssues:\n-UPDATE: ALL FIXED NOW-\nSince this is still in Early Acces, issues are often and thats nothing new.  One of them is a free skin glitch, where i was able to use the skin that i did not own. I simply left locked skin selected when leaving the hangar and i had it equipped in next round. Tried it again next few times, didnt work after.\nAnother thing, there are only 3 servers and closest one to me is London but for some reason my ping never drops below 150. And i can't join lobby that has players in it, started or not... It simply displays an error when i try to join it, so i have to be the first one to join an empty lobby in order to play.\n\nBut this is a game with great potencial overall, hope all the issues get fixed soon and it gets better. Very promising game.\nEarly Acces verdict - 9/10. Just my opinion.\nHope this review has explained a bit about it, and sorry for my bad english. Have a nice day.","May 1, 2015","true","7.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

For an alpha game, the graphics on the ships are flawless, and trust me, only having 1 map doesn't make the game tedious since the fun doesn't come from pretty scenery, it comes from great plays and battles. It's a complicated rock-papers-scissors that requires coordination and strategy even if the idea is simple.\n\nMy only gripe is the tech and upgrade trees, how one has to unlock a certain ship or ability when their end goal is a different ship or ability. The ships and abilities are sidegrades anyways, fitting your playstyle so why not be able to directly unlock the ship/ability you want?\n\nOverall, a wonderful game that's only going to get better.

It wasn't the Dev's fault really. It was the fault of people who like to stack the odds in their favor by stacking their teams. The amount these Devs work on trying to make this the most balanced space PvP Arena out there shows they know what their game's weakness is and they really want it to be a great experience everytime. I was tempted to give a bad review but I have waited and over the last 6 months and I have seen a laser sharp focus on matchmaking so I am giving them a good review.

I would really recommend the developers just embrace the MOBA theme just as they do the space theme, it would make for a pleasureable experience and also attract an already humongous MOBA community.\n\nThe sectors idea is very nice and creative, but adding more of a lane feature like constant influx of computer NPC's that the capital ships can farm can generate a better "farming" instance besides the capturing of mines. The lanes could kind of interfere with how the mines are placed in the map, but a good way to counter this is maybe just having the lanes go straight through the middle of the three mines in the sector, therefore creating the "NPC lane" of a traditional MOBA.  The lanes would consist of small fighters and the occasional sisge-like small patrol cruiser. In most MOBA's they would be the creeps and the occasional siege catapult or engine. These NPC units would serve to finally give the player capital ships their real scale of masiveness. The capital ships are supposed to be impending flying space fortresses. This is definetely nailed in the Star Wars game Empire at War which has amazing space battles that ended up with me looking for something similar in Fractured Space. The varying types of ships serve to give the Mon Calamari and Star Destroyers the scale they deserve. This might be an excellent example since I know this studio was partially inspired on their previous game, Zero Suit, by the tremendous universe that is Star Wars. The varying scales of the ships fighting in Empire at War space battles added a way more epic feeling not only for the scale, but also the complexity of the conflict, the firepower and chaos.\n\nThe Gamma sector is definetely very cool, serves in what in LoL would be the Baron and in Dota Roshan to gain extra bonuses for your team.\n\nUpgrades could be diversified a lot, maybe creating a sort of shopping list in forward and main bases to upgrade a ship better. For instance, upgrades that you want to choose to adapt to a situation. Armor agaisnt sniper-like overseer ships would be interesting for a Heavy class capital ship and therefore serve in balancing out any problems their might be with balancing ship classes in game. This would definetely be an area to do a lot of work and thinking on, there exist many possibilities which the developers should definetely take advantage on and expand.\n\nOverall, great game, would gladly play waaaaaaay more from now on, and I love the dedication it is recieving.

For some reason a Hunter (generally squishy with medium dps) with no assist from support ships or gas power can solo a carrier who is throwing literally every single fighter he has at it and smashing his left click, useless pencil beam. The only good thing about carriers is it's immense fighter control range. Being able to send bombers to an enemy ship the second they jump in is nice, but the damage sucks and they just die to point defense anyway.\n\nBut above all that, it has a lot of fun brawling that goes on, which is always a plus. So it still keeps the fun factor, but there are some serious balancing issues that should be addressed. I reccomend it to anyone who likes space-y grinder games and space battles. And the grind for ships is really not bad at all. You can get to the highest current tier in a couple of hours, but keep in mind too that this game is still new and young, so there's a limited amount of tiers/ships. But a rework of the damages accross the board would be nice.\n\n8/10 for fun and repeat factors, but due to imbalance on some ship classes it can cause some irritation, especially when flying the carrier.","October 5, 2015","true","32.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

For examble; most small ships can be taken out by a Colossus, but a Destroyer or Reaper can tear through a Colossus' armor and destroy it.\n\n-The game is very basic after you play a couple times: The controls are easy to learn, all your ship functions are layed out for you in the order that the abilities are on the keyboard/mouse, and after a match or two you begin to understand the role of what your ship is and how it fits into how to make your team the victor. Each ship has different abilities, roles, speeds, and differences which can help win an engagement.\n\n-They actively update it. This isn't an alpha game that sits, the devs actively improve ships, environments, and listen to their player base.\n\nThis is a good game. Get it if you think you'll enjoy a 5v5 capital ship game.","July 15, 2015","true","165.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

For some reason, people see cash shop skins, the ability to pay for half (and ONLY half) of the progression, and the prefix "premium" on certain ships and then come here screaming pay to win.\n\nTo keep it short, premium ships are the exact same as their counterpart (EG:  The Phantom Ghost is a reskinned Ghost, the Revenant Reaper is a reskinned Reaper) save for their appearance.  The major difference is that they can only be obtained during events or when purchasing the Vanguard pack, and that they look slightly different.  In addition, they come with fixed loadouts meaning they don't have the same options as their counterparts, and are therefore arguably WORSE.\n\nThat being said, if you really think paying for a very slight increase in your progression speed/skins is "paying to win", I think you need to go educate yourself.\n\nA lot of time has passed since my last review, so I thought I'd update it for the free weekend.  This is not a game you will pick up right away and be great at.  That being said, there is far more to this game than you think there is, just like CS:GO, LoL, and any other competitive MOBA style game.  You need to learn to be great at the game.\n\nAnyway, the matchmaking system is a big work in progress.  Expect a few bugs if you plan on picking it up right now.  It's better than it was yesterday, but hopefully you don't have any issues.\n\n\nOriginal Review on: Apr 19, 2015 @ 1:36pm\n\nI absolutely love the game, however, it's not very optimized yet. As a result, low end computers like mine can barely keep up. (Especially when a Flagship is shooting its flak everywhere.) Over the last few months, there has been quite a lot of improvements/additions to the game, so hopefully optimization is on their list.\n\nNow a little about the game: It's basically a capital ship battle MOBA. There are 2 lanes, each with 2 large bases at either end of the lane (each owned by a different team at the start), and 3 resource bases in between both bases. There is also a gas facility in the center of the map that becomes available a few minutes in that gives temporary combat bonuses such as rate of fire, and cooldown reduction on abilities, similar to the old Baron in LoL.\n\nThe pacing of the game can vary just as much as other moba games. Short, very one sided matches can last less than 20 minutes, while the more common close matches can last upwards of 40 minutes.\n\nI paid $15 for the game for early access and other mostly cosmetic bonuses and I definitely do not regret it. However, if you don't want to pay for the game and you want early access, download it during a free weekend (like the weekend I'm writing this) and you get to keep it.\n\nIn conclusion: I love space games, and I love competitive games. This game has both. As a free to play game, I definitely recommend you try this game.\n","January 30","true","127.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

For some reason a Hunter (generally squishy with medium dps) with no assist from support ships or gas power can solo a carrier who is throwing literally every single fighter he has at it and smashing his left click, useless pencil beam. The only good thing about carriers is it's immense fighter control range. Being able to send bombers to an enemy ship the second they jump in is nice, but the damage sucks and they just die to point defense anyway.\n\nBut above all that, it has a lot of fun brawling that goes on, which is always a plus. So it still keeps the fun factor, but there are some serious balancing issues that should be addressed. I reccomend it to anyone who likes space-y grinder games and space battles. And the grind for ships is really not bad at all. You can get to the highest current tier in a couple of hours, but keep in mind too that this game is still new and young, so there's a limited amount of tiers/ships. But a rework of the damages accross the board would be nice.\n\n8/10 for fun and repeat factors, but due to imbalance on some ship classes it can cause some irritation, especially when flying the carrier.","October 5, 2015","true","32.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Most of it is due to angry kids, not getting everything at once for free or confusing facts.\n\nPros:\n\n- Real money only buys you exclusive cosmetics in this game. EVERYTHING else is achieveable with ingame money. I didn't spend a dollar on this game for progress.\n\nReal money also buys:\n\n: Boosters (they will double your XP or Credits after one round. But you can get them through rng drop pods after playing a couple of games)\n\n: You could buy a ship with Platinum (real money  currency) instead of credits. BUT it would be expensive and you also have to pay with XP for the ship, which isn't buyable with real money. So most likely you have enough credits after getting enough XP for one ship.\n\nIT ISN'T PAY TO WIN!\n\n- Higher tier ships aren't better than the starter ships. In fact the starter ships are very powerful. The higher tier is just more complex to play and imho more fun. They try to balance every ship the same. So you don't need the most expensive ship to win.\n\n- Every ship has it's own style to play with. So it is very different and brings a lot of depth to the game.\n\n- You can't win this game on your own. You have to play as a team and you have to communicate. If you don't do that you are doomed and more experienced players will turn from helpful to salty. So if you are new and you red this: Please play as a team and have an eye out for your mates. Let people help you.\n\n- Graphics are good and there are a lot of visual improvements with most updates.\n\n- Long term fun.\n\n- You can play as a team up to 3 in public matches. Which will get raised when there are enough people to play against as a premade team. So it doesn't screw the balance too bad.\n\n- There is a shooting range so you can try any ship before grinding for it.\n\n- 2 game modes. Conquest that takes a little longer (25-50 minutes depending on the teams and balance). And Frontline, which is fast paced and gives you a random ship out of all ships and will provide a big battle arena (just one lane) in which you have to win in 12 minutes. After that it is sudden death.\n\n- People are in general friendly if you treat them the same. Even though the climate in the lower brackets seems to be a little more salty.\n\n- Devs are super responsive. They read the forums every day and provide as much help as possible and give answers directly. Also they are taking a lot of criticism and suggestions into the game to improve it for the community.\nTheir balance is ongoing and when they messed something up they try to fix it fast.\n\n- There are monthly updates with a lot of content (new ships, new gameplay features, etc.)\n\n- It is free and no money grab. So why not play it guys?! Go get the game.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Small player base. Matchmaking takes up to 10 minutes in off peak hours. And then the balance is somewhat messed up, for experienced players have to play with new ones. Which isn't much fun for both sides.\nIn peak hours it is more like 3 minutes. Which is OK.\n\n- The grind is very big. You need to play A LOT to unlock everything (which isn't really necessary, for there are no "better ships" in general). But it could be frustrating.\n\n- For the time being if a player disconnects you don't get a new team member. They have to reconnect to the match. Or else it would be 4 vs. 5.\nThe disconnected players can't get into a new game until their left one is finished though...","May 21","true","573.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

As an early-access Alpha, the growing community had direct input into how the game evolves, the feedback of the players directly impacting the direction of the game developers. This process proves that the game developers care about what their players have to say, and are building the game around the community, instead of trying to build a community around the game.\n\nThe game itself does have a small learning curve as there are numerous ships and play styles, along with more complicated tactics and strategies that are always evolving, but it’s well worth it to put in the time and effort necessary to master these skills. With more than 40 hours invested in this game, I still feel like I’m learning new things and tweaking my playstyle constantly in order to find new competitive edges.\n\nBuyers keep in mind that the game is early-access, so not everything is perfect and polished yet, it is only an Alpha build, but its on a good track.

GREAT developers: active, respectful and community-oriented. The way they fix problems and deliver updates is outstanding.\n\nLet me just suggest this to players: promote the game. Make it popular. The price is great (could still be a lil higher, and lower ship skins prices). Invite your friends (a 2-game-copies bundle would be FANTASTIC).

But no, its quite a bit more interesting than that... Its more than just pushing up your own lane - its feels more like sector based combat/capture the flag or tug of war rather than just blowing up towers to get to the other side.\n\nReally interesting ideas here reminds me of WoT, make sure you angle your armor correctly and keep spinning to show new sides of armor, because if you get shot in the same place, you lose plating and die faster, but if you keep spinning you can really make the most out of your EHP - interesting idea.\n\nGame looks spectacular, and when you see your buddies shooting other people with lasers flying by you go, damn, wish Eve was like this (Been playing Eve not via steam since 2010), so its very visualy pleasing.\n\nTry the game out - I'll definately come back to this.  Unfortunately, little lag spikes (On part of my GPU I imagine) discourages me from playing much online (Don't want to be that guy who lags out), but progression system seems WoT-Star Conflict like, and you havea lot of neat research and abilities to use so...\n\nJust give it a try already.","January 28","true","2.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

(kinda like Rift is to LoL)\n\nPROs:\n-3 'starter' ships, 1 of each faction, each feels and handles totally differently and has a different roll.\n-Leaning the roll of your ship means you have a better idea of how to engage/not engage nme fleets (as a frigate i now know how to reliably kill a flagship 1v1, as a corvette, i know its suicide to 1v1 anything other than a sniper.)\n-just because you are hidiously out tonned doesnt mean you are helpless, it just means you have a significantly less forgiving fleet that needs to fight smart to win.\n-The map is crazy fun once you understand how it works and how to navagate it.\n-jumping = hidiously vulnarable, knowing when to jump is critical to winning. (more so when you play big slow ships like the flagship, destroyer, or even the reaper honestly (feels kinda tubby for an 'attack ship')\n-its free! (atm...)\n\nCONs:\n-no key binding info in game, or any way to easily change it. (how many times have i ment to go down and jumped to Gamma... ugh)\n-what the hell are upgrades?!\n(ANS: it's your ship leveling up after your tream gains resources for those things you cap'd that dont seem to do anything. its automatic once you capture a base, you then need to 'heal' , read: sit at a base to recover health, and you will notice your hp max has gone up.)\n-looks like a rip off of Dreadnaught which im really anxious to play.. but whatever, right?\n-no real balance between the factions.. the corvette tree has 2.. 'ok' ships.. the hunter tree has 2 awesome ships, and the flagship tree has all the REALLY NEAT ships (sniper, cloaker, ultra tank, and also the most OP close range brawler in the game... the 'brawler' - its ♥♥♥♥in evil. not that all the other ships cant be evil, but this one will tear your bowels out if you let it close.

Unlike other games, you can't buy one ship and overpower everyone by just buying the most expensive ship. They all have their strengths and weaknesses, and your play style must adapt to what ship you have and what situation you are in.\n\nThey all have distinctive weapons, sounds, looks, and abilities.\n\nThere's no many good space combat games out there, so I believe it would be safe to say that this is the best in it's category.\nNow, that's not to say that it's absolutely perfect.\n\nWhile they have had patches and updates, the matchmaking is flawed. Because of the slim amount of players, they can't quite match everyone up by rank. This somtimes ends up pitting newer players into more skilled people. Another issue from the lack of players is that it can be a pain to find a match, god forbid its late at night.\n\nBut if you're looking for a space combat game that isnt pay to win, has good graphics and gameplay, this is the game  you want. It's a bit of a learning curve to get used to having to position and maneuver your ship to keep your armor between you and the other ship as well as your guns, but once you get past that and learn how the enemy ships work, this game can be a blast.\n\nOut of all the games i've played, i'd have to recommend this the strongest.","April 29","true","181.9"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

Hopefully when they put a bit more work into it down the line it'll definitely be worth playing. Plenty of potential, but a lot of it is wasted at the moment.

I played it a few months ago during the free weekened and liked it so much I wanted to keep it. I then convinced my roomates to get it, and we had a blast. But eventually the lack of content and the slow grind made me grow a bit tired kinda soon. Still liked it, but I needed a break. A few months later I came back, only to be slapped in the face repeatedly by a broken UI full of glitches and a queue system that wouldn't allow me to get in any game time. The poor matchmaking is nothing new, to be honest. It took forever for me to get in a match without getting disconected from the server every few seconds during the matchmaking process, but after about two minutes I was typically in. The player base is pretty dead now, so good luck finding anyone to play with. the gameplay itself is fun and strategic with what little it has, but it's become a broken mess of a game and shattered the large amount of potential it had going for it.

Every game is pretty much the same. You can't get into matches with your friends. Many critical functions are broken.
