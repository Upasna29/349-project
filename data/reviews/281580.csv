Download it here: http://download.thirdwire.net/files/dl/WOE_Update_Oct2008b.exe\n\nSomething more is that there is some pretty awesome third party addon content for this simulation that is faithful to sim itself and the flight eras it offers. Check the great site: http://www.column5.us in the campaign section for a series of four addons that will improve your experience of this great sim.\n\nAs a flight sim hobbyist but not a dedicated, I've had a long history with flight sims such as Chuck Yeager's Flight Trainer and Air Combat Sim, MS Flight Simulator (from the very early days). Aces Over Europe and Red Baron (both Dynamix) and Knights Of The Sky (Microprose) who included greats like Billy Bishop (a Canadian Ace from WWI) and Ike Immelman (a tactical aviation innovator whom has a manoeuvre with his namesake). Spectrum Holobyte's Falcon 3.0 which utilized the new advancement of the FPU unit of the Intel 386 to offer real military quality flight simulation (apparently Spectrum Holobyte adapted their actual military flight simulator technology for use in the game).\n\nOne of my favourite flight sims was F117 Stealth Fighter by Microprose on the basis of its customizable mission dynamics and flight strategy with stealth technology, you were guaranteed replayability. Which is what brings me to Wings Over Europe.\n\nWings Over Europe has all of the elements of the classic flight simulator games offered by Microprose and one of my heroes of Microprose, "Wild" Bill Cody who was like a the Tom Clancy of flight simulation in his day. It has all of these elements without overdoing it and keeping it simple enough for the newcomer to flight simulation to accomplish and advance.\n\nMost of the missions take place during the Cold War, so you won't be flying any stealth fighters such as the YF-22 or F-35. You will however get a fun and unmatched flight experience of the cold war era and a lesson in the advance of jet and missile technology during the era. Missions are tense though sometimes you might not have an encounter during a mission in campaign mode if you are careful enough. This is what brings the realism to it. The enemy AI is great and they communicate, so once you're spotted, that's it. They're firing AAA or SAMs and scrambling their hardware to dispatch you.\n\nI'm running Windows 7 (32-bit) and though I've found that it runs great, it tends to drop out of the game after missions but still retains your progress. I've run the same game on Windows Vista (several years ago) and played it through time and again without problem so I suspect that what I'm experiencing is a UAC problem (maybe running under admin will work).\n\nYou don't need a flight stick to fly the flight sim as the keyboard controls are good, but a flight stick would definately be a big advantage.\n\nOne of the greatest features is that the entire battlefield feels like it a living and breathing conflict and the enemy and allies are on standby all of the time. There are ground units whose eyes and ears can result in you being spotted resulting in a nearby airfield dispatching its own air CAP to deal with you.\n\nLikewise you might fly missions where you are quickly scrambled while enemy squadrons attack your airfield.\n\nAll in all a very enjoyable experience despite the fact that it is an older title. The graphic and gameplay hold up for certain. Just try all of the different camera views and you'll see what I mean...\n\nHighly recommended for any avid flight sim fan especially those of Microprose flight sims, and those who are new to flight simulation who want something that is scalable as they learn more about the controls and aircraft. Don't get me wrong, this has some advanced features like targeting different targeting (supporting A2A, A2G, A2R and Guns) and radar modes and ECM and a Radar Jammer (Electronic Counter Measures) as well.\n\nThis is the flight sim for fans of classic sims and those looking to get into sims.\n\nIf you want to get pumped about this and games like this, watch the movie The Right Stuff.\n\nBrian Joseph Johns","November 29, 2014","true","20.8"," 50 of 50 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","50","50","2","2"

The planes included all have their advantages and disadvantages,  and it rewuires some thought to load them and select them. Another plus about this game is the huge mod community.  www.column5.us has many great plane addons and also the NATO Fighter packages. ww.combatace.com also has many addons, which include weapons, textures and planes. However, I would not reccomend installing the "October 2008 Patch". When I installed it,  it erased all my addons, pilot data, and I was unable to load weapons onto my plane. I then had to delete and reinstall the game. But still, this game will always be ranked oin the top with me.","December 29, 2015","true","21.8"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Perriwen/recommended/281580/","Perriwen","Perriwen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Perriwen/","904 products in account","This flight sim is some of the most fun I have had in a long time. It feels a lot like the old, defunct sims Janes would put out back in the 1990s. Not exactly as hard-core 'study sim' as the more pricey DCS modules (such as A-10C), but also not nearly as arcadey as Ace Combat and HAWX. The mix of aircraft included stock is pretty good, especially if you are a fan of the F-4 Phantom II or the original Harrier designs. But, there is also a HUGE mod scene with all kinds of aircraft you can add into the game, including the A-6 Intruder, A-7 Corsair, F-14 Tomcat, MORE versions of the F-4, and the A-4.\n\nIf it wasn't obvious, this game isn't meant to be 'modern', but based on hypothetical scenarios that could have occured from the 1960s to 1980s between the Soviet Union and NATO. There is a single mission generator based on many mission types, including escort, fighter sweep, recon, strike, close air support, anti-ship, and scramble. Going into the settings menu, you can decide if you will start on the runway for a full-on mission, or about 15 miles from the target for some quick action. My one complaint, is there really isn't a mission builder as to be expected in simulations like this included. It is randomized based on the variables you customize. But, that is easily forgivable. BE SURE that you download the latest patch from Third Wire, as that will drastically improve stability on modern operating systems.","September 12, 2014","true","8.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

They do not get any money from this :(\n\nAFTER PATCHIGN START FROM THE EXE NOT WITH THE STEAM CLIENT!!!!! Important or it will crash...\n\nOne of the best sims out there. It is not the most accurate in weapon management or flight model, but the gameplay is über. More than that, the game is totally moddable, you can basically play any combat plane of the last 70 years in any mission, especially if you combine the games together. You can fly any kind of mission under any nation, under any scenery. Just use the modpacks that are freely available!!\n\nIt is a very good entry to the series, because of the price and the huge number of mods that already available. The second series is the more up-to-date one though, but that is more expensive. That contains some optimizations, new features and better modding capabalities(mostly). But Wings over Europe is a very good start. A good set of basic planes, various missions, and let me repeat myself a tons of mods.\n\nAt this moment I can intercept Bears over the Bering Strait with my Canadian Arrow, or bomb the hell out out California with my Su-17, or wipe the floor with Lybia flying in a Panavia Tornado, with this very same game. So get it, and get to the developer website and get the series!!!!\n\nHowever this version is not the official one, this is an outdated version which is owned by Strategy First. The developer has a series of fighters which can be combined together for maximum fun.","January 19, 2015","true","0.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

AND APARRENTLY I DID...So I had bought this expansion long ago and did not realize it. Saw it on Steam thought it was something new from thirdwire, hit add to cart. Not gonna ask for a refund. Why you may ask...\n\nStrikefighters has always been one of the best "Fun to fly" non arcade, non simulator games ever developed. Sad thing is, none of the rest of the series is available on steam. And I have them all including SF2, and all of it's variants and expansions.\n\nWhat tops this series over SF2? This entry in the Strikefighters series is from the time when hundreds of mods were available for this game. Yes, hundreds of mods, and if you search thoroughly these mods are still available. From aircraft (some heli's can be found out there), to map packs to, complete missions and campaigns.  In comparison to SF2 everything in SF2 is now DLC. Mods also worked online so long as the people you were playing with had the same mods. Much like Torchlight. You can also find the map & weapon editors from Strikefighters Project 1 and it works with all non SF2 variants, E.G.: SF: Project 1, SF: Wings Over Europe, SF: Wings Over Vietnam & SF: Isreal 6 Day War. Each aircraft and vehicle in SF has it's own flight/combat characteristics/weapon loadout limitations. So far I have accumulated 5.64gb's of mods with an average of 4mb per aircraft/vehicle & 20mb per complete campaigns & maps.\n\nAs another reviewer had also mentioned, yes sadly you have to get the updates from the developer site. And another reviewer mentioning to run the executable rather than the steamn link. SF was noted to have issues with newer OS's past XP, but with the needed patch it has cleared up seemingly all those issues. But once you get it to run perfectly, you will find yourself wasting plenty of flight hours destroying all you can see. I still hold this game #1 over all the newer flight games that are not complete sims.\n\nWould not buy again...again...since I already have bought it again 10/10","June 20, 2015","true","0.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I have been a Thirdwire Sim user since Strike Fighters Project 1 and had WOE working perfectly on Vista. I have alot of work involved installing Mods that also worked perfectly on Vista. I won't buy the new version from the Thirdwire Website because its nothing but a money grab. All the old versions needed was a compatability patch, but instead Thirdwire released versions for newer OS at $30 a piece with very little done to change the old games. A few minor tweaks is the only difference, its still basicly the same game. Also Aircraft that were included in the old versions are now sold seperately, just a way to milk a few more dollars from their fanbase.\n\nThirdwire also says they make no money from the steam version since Steam purchased it from another rights holder. What they won't tell you is they already got paid when they sold the rights in the first place. I was in the community and i know this game inside and out as far as editing and modding. I had alot of fun with these games in the beginning, but now with the cash grab and the fact that you must buy the new version if you want to use a new OS i am just left disgusted and will not give Thirdwire another dime.\n\nWhos to say they won't pull the same crap again when a new OS comes out? All these games need is a patch to the exe for compatability which only the developer can do, its beyond what modders have done so far, but instead of a patch you have to buy a whole new game and to be honest $30+ the DLCs to bring it back to the original game is overpriced and just not worth it.\n\nEDIT: Ok, I can't claim this will work for everyone, i am not even sure it will continue working for me but i have completed two missions without a CTD by setting the Exe to Windows XP (Service Pack 2) in the compatability tab when you right click on it and select Properties. Like i said, i have alot of work involved in customizing this sim so its hard for me to just give up on it. Hopefully this will help someone, but it would still be better if Thirdwire would just patch it so we don't have to edit the FLIGHTENGINE.INI and mess with compatability modes.","November 29, 2014","false","0.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It will remember me to the good old times with EF2000 or F22 Raptor. In this time this great fligth jet simulatiors will born. Ok long time ago :) So this one is nice i think. But so many problems with the graphic in full screen with 3 Monitors and i have problems to in the beginning with the config of the joystick. I will look to fix the problems and make a guide for this. I think it is a good simulation of jets. Thx for bring it out to steam!","October 5, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
