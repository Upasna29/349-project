I really do, but please read on for my honest review.\n\nWhen I first played I accidently killed my friend trying to defend him from a bear and got flagged as a murderer. Then some random yellow name came up and murdered me in return. He doesn't get flagged. He took all the apples I got from punching trees too. I was left with a fear of other players, a few twigs and an empty stomach.\n\nThere were buildings everywhere. Buildings with stone walls, buildings with wood walls and some with no walls. Then I saw these little smoking squares on the ground and tried to pick one up. 'Trace of Evil' it said. I didn't really know what it was, but I moved on and found a little flat piece of land to call my own. Starting to build was fun. I found it really exciting. The ideas were all worked out and despite the poor translation of many item names, I managed to figure things out really easily. The controls were pretty intuitive and I liked the idea of not tab targeting enemies.\n\nThose kobolds really hurt when you're punching at them nude.\n\nAfter I got a nice little tent set up, a campfire and a couple fences my red name turned back to yellow. Feeling a bit more comfortable, I ran off and started to explore, picking up all sorts of resources and coin to help me along the way. The night time was really rough, I didn't realize there would be so many zombies and skeletons attacking my tent. When morning came around I had managed to die a couple of times and could not figure out how to repair my tent.\n\nAnother yellow name came along, he had a full set of armor and backpack and adorable cat ears. I asked him how to repair my tent and he explained to me. Of course, you hold your money in your hand to repair a broken tent. Why didn't I think of that?\n\nI thanked the kindness of this stranger, right up until he opened my tent and proceeded to take everything I had gathered, leaving me with two stacks of twigs and the firewood in my campfire. My stomach growled.\n\nAfter I realized you could make locks, I never stopped. Tinkering became my hobby and I was really enjoying the torches and lanterns it provided. I moved to a new location that had more resources, because the runs to gather copper was draining.\n\nMy new place started to get some walls up and I had cabins, it was looking pretty good. A tiny farm, a few chickens, it was great until some neighbor moved in right next door. I had asked her why she kept trying to look at my locked tents and why she kept taking my chickens. She didn't speak any english but it looked like Portuguese when she responded, I'm not sure what she said. However, her town built up faster than mine and even though I invited some friends, I never really managed to get my walls closed before the real raids started.\n\nIt only took two of them, but without armor and strong weapons we were defenseless. They moved in, destroyed our walls, our cabins our gates. Flattened our fences and worktables. Stole water from our wells (I know now you -can- lock a well) and used it to run around and murder us repeatedly. After about an hour of this, they left us alone. I repaired, managed to get another crude knife, continued to go about my daily routine, though a little shaken up.\n\nThen they did it again, this time with  more people. We were flattened in thirty seconds, murdered in less that and they proceeded to stick around and wait for us to respawn over and over again, scouring the woods and seeking us out to murder us some more for hours longer. I finally just logged out.\n\nThe next day, I went in to realize that there were traces of evil everywhere. The portuguese speaking woman had her base leveled and so did everyone else we could see.\n\nDecided to move again.\n\nAfter we moved, we had a great time. Skills were going up, we were trading, selling, making new friends. I had no problems with anyone but a few random rednames who tried to steal. Copper was harder to come by, but it was okay, I didn't mind spending over an hour to get an inventory full. I gave to the new players, helped my neighbors by repairing their walls, defending friends against an onslaught of raiders.\n\nThen the griefers came again. A new town, a new place and new walls with a guild hall. At first I didn't believe it. Everything was stolen from once again. My towers had no arrows, my cabins were empty and even the tree I planted to look pretty, was chopped down. What was so shocking though was, all my walls were still intact.\n\nDid they break in and take everything but was kind enough to repair the wall after they left? The gates were all locked as well, I was at a loss.\n\nHowever, each night, the same happened again. This repeated for three days. (My livestock was stolen by my "friendly" neighbors). On the fourth night I logged in about the time that the trace of evil had said and watched it. They weren't breaking down my walls, they were ghosting through them! I had never seen that before. He just walked straight through and stayed yellow named as he proceeded to take everything again with a constant onlsaught of 'u mad bro?' and 'lol' as I watched.\n\nI logged out and haven't been back online since.\n\nThe PvP of the game, doesn't bother me. I had no real qualms with the occasional raid, the occasional thief and even the yellow-name brazilians. What finally got on my nerves was the amount of consistant and repeated griefing that makes the game near unplayable. The straw that broke the camels back? The hacking. I have no idea how he did it or what exploit he was using, but there was no consequences for that person repeatedly taking from me and going around the system to do so.\n\nThe game is great, it's fun and if you want to risk it, I would highly reccomend you do so. For the price? Not so much. The upgrade gets you a tiny little backpack and a hairstyle, it's not worth it. It is not worth its current list price, even at early access.\n\nI know the developers are working on it. They are a team of three with only one community advisor to translate for them. They threw their game to the sharks and the players are feeding. I'm sure they did not realize what horrors would transpire as they put their game on Steam.\n\nIt is too early though.","June 14, 2015","false","78.5"," 416 of 467 people (89%) found this review helpful 52 people found this review funny","89","416","467","52","16"

I'm not telling you to not play Tree of Life, just informing you of what you'll face if you decide to play it. Thanks.\n\nI used to have a great property in the desert, surrounded by wooden walls, it was pretty... And it felt secured. I had all my crafting skills maxed out, good neighbours, I've even had a bull for 2 hours before someone stole it while I was mining, but I didn't really mind, I was not a traveller. I had seeds for every plants, every crafting stations, a huge stockpile of rocks and logs for those in need. I had towers filled with arrows to protect my camp from monsters. I had two animals of each kind in my small farm so I could get eggs, milk, etc without searching for hours outside. Sweet memories.\n\nAnd then, two things happened.\n\nOne day, a guild arrived in the desert and began to plant swamp trees. After less than a week, the whole desert had been polluted by those trees, it didn't look like a desert anymore. You can always cut trees, I said to myself, so I didn't care that much. But my friendly neighbours simply left the game for that. Oh well, I said to myself, someone else will eventually settle there.\n\nLater, one member of this guild came to my camp and asked for some help. I gladly accepted to help them build walls, I had a lot of rocks and limestones anyway. So I took all my limestones, closed the door behind me, went to their camp and worked there for an hour or so. This guy thanked me and I went back to my place. The thing is, my place wasn't here anymore. While I was helping him, other members of the said guild raided my cute little camp. They had destroyed my walls, towers, lockpicked all my storages. They had killed all of my animals, destroyed my fields, and they had thrown everything on the ground to make it despawn. I've helped them during one hour, and they have returned me the favor by ruining a mounth of hard work.\n\nOf course at first I was very angry, so I took out my sword and killed them all, green and red players alike. They didn't expect this at all, so they didn't fight back. After my rampage, I simply gave up on playing. I didn't want to spend a whole week building a new camp with those guys around. Also, I had turned red for the first time of my short life, so they would have just killed me over and over again, my armor and sword weren't infinite... So I have just stoped playing. Thanks to them, I have a social life now.","October 12, 2015","false","140.8"," 605 of 704 people (86%) found this review helpful 201 people found this review funny","86","605","704","201","62"

All along I have been wondering to myself - "Why isn't anyone playing this game, its awesome."\n\nNow, this game is hardcore. After a month of hard work, my stats were halfway to max. You spend hours gathering, hours crafting. The progression is SUPER slow. I'm ok with all of that. But the game is very well made and thought out and I kept wondering why doesn't anyone play this game.\n\nThe servers never get wiped - so there is a camp every 50 feet in the game. There is no global chat - which really sucks. But it is still a super fun hardcore survival game.\n\nSo, last week, I got jumped by a clan. I fought them for hours - it was a blast. Even though I eventually lost, I had a great time and I knew I could start over. The killed me, trashed my base and took everything I had built up. One complaint - when you build towers in this game, you can stand under them while you are being slaughtered and they will do NOTHING for you. They will only attack if the enemy does damage to your base.\n\nStill, it was fun, really fun. I started over, built my base back up, resupplied myself. Then I got my revenge. The clan that attacked me wasn't around - so I completely trashed their base. Sweet revenge!\n\nSo, the "criminal" system in this games doesn't care if you are defending yourself or getting revenge. I became marked as a criminal. Didn't really affect me.\n\nI went back to work, gathering, leveling skills, gathering, leveling skills, endlessly. No matter, my base was expanding, my supplies were growing, I was starting to be able to make good armor and weapons.\n\nA week later, some guy comes durping along and kills me. No big deal. I respawn and fight him again, and again. he kills me a half dozen times, steals my stuff and eventually leaves me alone. I am fine with all of this. Greifing is part of a hard core game.\n\nWell, I reset up my base and I am determined to go look for this guy. I go to remake my armor and weapons and I find that HALF my skillpoints are gone. It is a game penelty for "being a criminal." So, this game punishes you HARSHLY for defending yourself against overwhelming odds (the clan) and being griefed???? I asked the community about this and basically got "thats the rules , cry moar, hardcore, don't be a criminal."\n\nOnce again, you will become a criminal for DEFENDING yourself. The you will LOSE a months works because someone decides to greif you.\n\nThis game isn't "hardcore" its f-ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nAfter all this time of wondering why nobody plays this game.......NOW I KNOW!!!!!\n\nI cannot believe how much time I spent trying to play, telling all my friends how great it was all to come to this.\n\nNo wonder the servers are empty!!\n\nNo wonder nobody plays.\n\nThe devs have spent a lot of hours making this game 99% awesome. Too bad they made a game that has no players and probably never will onc ethey realize what a waste of time they are in for.","February 21","false","500.8"," 238 of 270 people (88%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","88","238","270","27","11"

This was (based on the purple smoke that appears when people do bad things so you know who has done it) in responce to yesterday when his friend walked into out camp and died due to towers because he was trying to kill the animals (we did not do anything).  The fact that 1 Lone person can undo 63 hours of game time and cause you to have to farm for at least 15 hours just to get back to where you were is imo rediculous.

It's a good game. You run around, you pick up sticks, you make little houses and ride cows. What's not to like? The game's got charm in spades, and it's fun for about 12 hours. After those 12 hours, you have a problem if you want to keep your stuff. I'm not going to say it's impossible, but it's very hard. You don't get walls until Carpentry 18 and even then they're not very effective. You don't get locks until tinkering 14 and that's if you're lucky enough to find iron which, for me, took a total of four hours.\n\nEven then, the locks do nothing. People will destroy your houses, and I've seen this pretty much everywhere. If you're not in a guild or a relatively large group, your buildings will be destroyed shortly after you log off. Don't leave any farms growing either, they'll often be taken. Your mounts? Not locked to an individual, so they can be ridden away by anyone that wanders by. But that's not the worst part.\n\nI was attacked by reds shortly after starting the game, and that was FINE. That's a fair fight, where I'm innocent and you're the aggressor. What's annoying are the reds and yellows that work together. The reds distract you while the yellows look through everything in your town that you can take. If you attack and kill them, you get turned red, which is what they want so they get full loot rights because you're a 'murderer'. It's not the strategy that bothers me, it's having a game so poorly guess moral choices when it gives us no laws. We're not protected, so until I get locks on every house, anyone can just grab anything. My towers? Pitiful damage that red players can casually stroll through. And that's just for a handful of people that just felt like bothering someone else.\n\nThe hamlet I built will probably be gone by tomorrow, that's fine. I'll remember the fun I had before I was tricked and killed by two random people that were passing by. It's still a good game, it's like wurm and harvest moon had a baby, but I feel like will never effectively protect my belongings without being part of a much larger town, and that sucks. So I won't be playing.","May 28, 2015","false","9.7"," 326 of 398 people (82%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","82","326","398","16","21"

With it comes the usual crappy client issues like unexplained fps drops, screen tearing, client crashes, but that's the least of your worries.\n\nI really wanted to like the game, but I'm afraid it's very dull, featureless, boring, repetative, flawed and most importantly - time consuming.\n\nLet's start with the major flaws:\nThere is no party chat or global chat or guild chat. Wait! There is no party in the game. The sole guild feature in the game is that you can use your guild members' buildings if they put a guild lock on it. So where are your friends in the world? Ask them on Skype or Teamspeak, cuz there is no other way to find out. So for an online game, it's amazing how antisocial this game is, and how hard it is to play with others. And make no mistake. This is NOT a game you can solo, unless you play like 70 hours for the first 4-5 days, and at least 3 hours every day after that.\n\nNight and day follow each other in quick succession. Night time is so dark, that you literally can't see anything. I'm not joking. It's pitch black. Seriously. Black. This means that you either spend LOTS of resources on lightning (which is very dumb) or you limit yourself to tasks that don't require moving or seeing (standing 10 minutes crafting, harvesting lumber or stone). If you try to do anything else then you'll be GREATLY penalized.\n\nTraveling is superslow, superboring, superblehI'lljustaltf4.\nBut you'll need to travel, because certain resources like "lava sculpture" (red ore) or corn or whatever is not found in your home biome. Let me translate:\nYou want to get lava? Push WWWWW for 10 minutes. Look at a completely black screen (night) for 10 minutes. Do some mining, then head back and push the same boring WWWWW for 20 minutes, and stare at a completely black screen for 10 minutes. As there is no fast travel.\n\nIt took us about 80 manhours to build a base that can put up a small defense. Which means it has 1 of each type of buildings, 6 storage buildings, a wooden wall, and about 14 mark2 towers.\n80.\nHours.\nWithout a base you can't do anything, cuz crafting is dependent on crafting buildings, and storage space, so no fort = no buildings = no anything.\nEach night (every 10 minutes) zombies and skeletons will spawn and chip away at your walls. It takes about 5-10 minutes for 1 of these creatures to chip away at your walls. A tower kills them in about 10-15 arrows. Our base has to fend off about 4 mobs each night. So 15arrowpermob * 4mobpernight * 72 nights a day means you'll need about 4300 arrows a day. Those will have to be crafted by a carpenter. Someone will have to collect those mats. 20 arrow = 1 copper 1 lumber 1 feather. So you'll have to craft this recipe about 200 times a day. Just crafting all that ♥♥♥♥ requires you to sit at the crafting bench for 20 minutes, and crafting the lumber will take about 10 additional minutes, and that's the easy part! You have to collect these resources first, and that will take at least 2 manhours. You also need to repair the damaged buildings with coins. Certain monsters drop coins, and it will take about 10 minutes of beating up kobolds and skeletons and ♥♥♥♥ to have enough to fix your buildings.\n\nSo all in all, your completely minimalistic base spends about 3 hours a day just to defend itself from monsters at night with a high success rate.\nAnd that's only if RNGesus didn't spawn the monsters in an uneven way.\nAnd that's only if players didn't grief you. We were griefed every few hours. And you will be too! We went for a 20 minute break on the first day. Base got destroyed. We went to sleep on the first day. Half the base was destroyed. We went to sleep on the 2nd day. All our buildings were lockpicked. The arrows were stolen from our towers, so much of what the players didn't take or destroy was destroyed by monsters entering the disarmed base.\nBut the best thing is:\nIf you don't repair the base each day. Don't restock your arrows every 24 hours then your base will be leveled in 1 day, and you'll lose the time put into your lost items and buildings.\n\nLet me rephrase that:\nTHERE IS NO POINT IN PLAYING THIS GAME, UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING TO SPEND AT LEAST THREE HOURS A DAY ON JUST FORT MAINTENANCE.\n\nAnd even if you do. Some player might just decide to destroy your whole base for fun. He can do that naked with his fists if he wants to.\n\nBut why would you want to play this game? It has virtually nothing to offer besides building a base and crafting.\n\nCombat is really annoying and boring. Targeting is hard. You'll often end up hitting your buddy instead of the monster you are trying to hit. Trying to hit moving enemy players is hard, and not fun. There are no combat skills. So combat is basically clicking left button over and over again.\nFighting monsters is boring. There aren't many of them either. Again: you are just spamming 1 button the whole fight.\nThe world is dull too. Lack of landmarks or scenery or points of interest or variety.\n\nPvP is pretty much nonexistent except for griefing. You know why? Cuz it's boring, tedius, not rewarding, pointless.\n\nOh wait. There IS PvP in the game! In the form of griefing. This game is a griefers paradise. Through a long array of game design flaws and exploits people will destroy your base, and get away unpunished.\nYour weakass useless defense towers don't attack if they grief in certain ways:\n-They can harvest your crops\n-They can kill your animals\n-They can destroy your farmlands\n-They can destroy your workbenches, fire pits, planning tables, cooking tables and a few other things.\nWhen they destroy other buildings or kill you they will become "red" for a few minutes, and your towers will attack them, but it's so supereasy to tank/bandage towers and lockpick them and take out your arrows, or just facetank the arrows until they are depleted and the towers will stop firing.\nLong story short, anyone can EASILY break into your base if they want to grief you. We played for 4 days, and we encountered griefers every few hours. I estimate that about 10-15% of our time was spent on gathering resources that the griefers destroyed or took.\n\nThe game is FULL of griefers!\n\nI could go on for a long while about how...\nThe game was probably literally translated by Google translate. I'm not even joking.\nPair this with the fact that item decriptions are pretty bad or miswired (Egg says it's rotten meat, and so on).\nCharacter costumization doesn't exist.\n... and so on, but just save yourself from this game.\n\n\nWe scouted the surrounding areas, and about 95% of all bases on the world are abandoned wrecks, so, like us, most players get annoyed by the dull and frustrating game experience and just leave.","June 16, 2015","false","30.9"," 168 of 200 people (84%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","84","168","200","10","6"

EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. The people on this game are rude and destroy another person's hard work just because they can. Nobody wants to work for their own stuff - they would much rather steal it. I know a lot of people will say "well join a guild and you'll be safe". Wrong! All it takes is one wall being taken down for an entire fortress to be destroyed.\n\nSo long as people can come in and undo any hard work I put into this game (in one night, no less), I will NEVER recommend this game to another person. In fact, I would strong advise against buying the game. It's $20 wasted just to get frustrated every time you log in. I'm sure there are players who would say the opposite because they have entire towns of their own, but this is my opinion. Getting started in this game is next to impossible thanks to other players.

Also it's very punishing to kill people (which i dont like since that kinda blocks out pvp for a long period of time) basically people dont want to go above 500 criminal points, and you get around 100 criminalpoints per player kill or destroying a larger object/wall. and 500 criminalpoints basically go down in 500 mins (and you have to be online) so you can only do a limited amount of pvp, that kind of protects pve'rs but also ruins pvp fun, points for killing someone shouldnt be high, i understand the raiding aspect tho.\nalso because you have to build this special way, walls and laddersystem, if someone wants to join your guild you either have to build your guildhall somewhere else so they can access it somehow behind a gate, and still endanger your guildhall, or you have destroy your walls so he has access to join your guild, cause their isnt any remote guildinvite command or something... very annoying.\n\ni still cant recommend it, even tho i like it, especially for solo people, if you play with 2-4 friends or more you could try it, but you should be "STRONG" enough to rebuilt your base or refarm your materials after you got raided plenty of times.","May 5","false","328.9"," 109 of 131 people (83%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","83","109","131","10","0"

My recommendation is to wait at least a couple of months.\n\nI don't believe I can recommend this product at this time. Perhaps, after a couple more months of patching and refining, I will be able to change my rating, but there is a lot to be done before then. Let me be perfectly honest here, I enjoyed this game thoroughly, for a while, at least. The following is my specific tale in this game so far:\n\nThe beginning of my play through started with me wandering one of the starter isles in the pitch black of night, bumping into murderously slap-happy zombies and skeletons. Armed only with my karate pokes of justice, I quickly learned that fleeing was the best strategy. One of my friends soon arrived on a stolen bull with a saddle and soon led me to a nearby encampment where i could steal one for myself. Now riding our trusty beeves, we rode off into the wilds looking for this base my friend assured me was safe for us.\n\nWe crossed many different terrains on our way to the promised lands, from mesas to geyser fields to forests to crevasses, the land certainly wasn't the same looking for very long. It is at this time that I encountered the first of many bugs: My friend started randomly and rapidly taking damage whilst riding his trusty mobile steak platform and soon died. He dropped all of his stuff and became a spooky ghosty. This was no big deal at that moment because there was no one else around to steal any of his stuff so he quickly repossessed his now slightly used corpse and we continued on our journey.\n\nWe finally reached the base after about 45 minutes of travelling in circles and around hills, mostly because my friend relied on his memory to guide us instead of the coordinates he had copied down. They welcomed us fully into their guild and we had a place to rest at last. We quickly started working for our keep in our own ways: I was a tree puncher and log hauler, while my friend worked on his tinkering and rapidly became the resident Batman, what with his useful gadgets that he whipped out like locks for houses and lanterns.\n\nNight descends rapidly and rather frequently in this game, and it gets dark. As my least favorite Pyromancer in Game of Thrones says: "The Night is dark and full of Terrors." Zombies and skeletons are attracted to settlements and bases; the larger the base, the more they attack and it wasn't long before houses started to collapse from the undead onslaught. We would fight off the invaders as best we could, but the night is so dark and the torches so nearly useless at actually illuminating the surrounding area, we were usually too late to save anything.\n\nNow there is a way to repair in this game, but that brings us to a significant problem in this game: Very poorly translated tool tips that offer no real insight into what an item does. Now, some items are rather self-explanatory, fishing rods allow the catching of fish and swords are for filleting the creatures of the night, but others are just a mystery. For example, hostile mobs drop bronze coins. These coins are not used for a currency system or bartering. Instead, you take these coins and place them on a damaged building and then just hammer them into the side of it. This has the magical effect of repairing the building... somehow. The description on the coins did not point to this, indeed, the only thing I could make out about them is that they "have goblin face" on them. Another hilarious mistranslation would be the lumber mill. I believe that it is called the "Snow-Shredder." Because wood chips fall like snowflakes I suppose?\n\nAnd then there is the raiding aspect of the game. At this point in time, I see no reason to do much in the way of hard work when you can either steal all you need, or just have your stuff stolen. Yes there are locks in the game, however you can also pick those locks. If your big stuff like cabins or walls gets destroyed, you have a 24 hour grace period to repair it before it disappears, but most of the planning buildings and tables don't get this grace period and are flat out destroyed. People can parkour over walls and steal stuff inside the encampment, including mounts. You can also loot while mounted and be impossible to stop, since you cannot fight on the back of a mount and the only way to catch someone on a mount is to be mounted yourself, so you are kind of at an impasse, except the other guy has all your stuff.\n\nThings like this kill the fun factor of this game for me. Why should I work hard at something when the next time I log on, my fields have been torched and all my livestock butchered? When our walls are dust and our resources drained?\nIf you are a marauder, this will probably be a dream game for you. Rapid, unpredictable attacks on resource rich areas on the back of meals on wheels will make you the richest in the land, until someone steals that from you in turn.\n\nI suppose, what I'm finally getting at is this: This game has some amazing potential and I am prepared to love it to death, if only it gets more polish on it, someone hires a proper translator, and a serious look is taken at the crime system.","May 31, 2015","false","28.6"," 185 of 248 people (75%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","75","185","248","26","13"

Lots of things to do, enemies to kill, and levels to be gained.  20 hours went by and I was addicted. Then patch after patch came through. Items got nerfed, pvp became corrupt, evil guilds started wrecking havoc on honest people trying to enjoy the game without penalty.\n\nI still continued to play as i had made friends and wanted to grow.  After about 80 hours, I capped out my levels.  Realized that the world was quite small, the amount of enemies was incredibly smaller, grinding enemies proved to be worthless as enemies dropped only copper/silver/gold, linen, and a rare worthless mask.\n\nMoney is worthless in the game. Everyone tended to craft their own items, or have a guild mate craft them. As soon as you bought an item, a better one would be crafted making yours obsolete, and left to be dropped on the ground.\n\nThe biggest grief of the whole game is the sheer time it takes to build a fortress, wood walls, stone walls, towers galore, only to have a single point in the wall broken and all your loot ravaged. Lock Picking is too easy. The penalty for thieving/murdering/pillaging is non existant due to a broke pvp mechanic.\n\n80 Hours of building can be destroyed in minutes of harrassment.\n\nIn my opinion, the biggest killer of the game was a patch that reduced the durability on end game items so drastically that they were not even worth crafting. In addition, armor had durability which ended adventurers trying to make a living by grinding enemies. Hours and Hours dedicated to crafting end game gear, only for it to be nerfed to something of a joke.\n\nNot to mention, the game lags incredibly bad now.\n\nThats my rant.  I rated the game an A+ near launch, and easily left to a flat F now.  Server populations have to be about 10 people at any one time. A huge drop from launch. You would see hundreds of people. Now you literally have to search far and wide for someone. And when you do, its usually just someone reminiscing of the past when the game was alive, looking at a burning destroyed fort that once thrived.\n\nTake my advice and dont waste your time here.","August 4, 2015","false","104.0"," 89 of 106 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","89","106","2","0"

Apparently, previous reviewers have been given copies of the DLC upgrade in exchange for reviews. Just wanted to put it out there, I am not one of them. I write this, because I purchased the game and I felt it important to write a review to educate and inform others of my experience.\n\nImagine, 7 days to die(without zombies), mixed with Minecraft(without the blocky graphics), topped off with Harvest Moon. Yep, that is Tree of Life in a nutshell. It has aspects of all three games, making it fun, addictive, and exciting. A Crafting-Survival game, or at least it should be. The game bills itself as a crafting-survival game in a multiplayer world, where you can work with others to create communities; However, Earlier notices from game developers indicated that PVP would play a small part of the overall experience, but that the game was about crafting and survival and would be largely PVE in nature. This unfortunately, does not appear to be the case with this game.\n\nGrief of Life, or Tree of Grief as it is being billed in some online discussion threads, places you on a very large, open world island, with multiple biomes. where you are pitted against the islands inhabitants, and the strange creatures that emerge from the shadows at night. Build structures for safety as fast as you can, but beware creatures as well as other players can and will bust up your fort. The Game currently utilizes a Criminal Flagging system. Criminal flagging is earned by attacking other players and/or their structures. As a Criminal flagged red, you are unable to approach other cities or player watchtowers without automatically being attacked. Also as a criminal, anyone is free to attack you without reprecussions or negative consequences. Once a red player is killed, their backpack can be looted. Since the Criminal flag lasts a number of realtime minutes/hours, this has led to abuses of the flagging system, where neutral players camp and grief them without any reprecussions, going as far as preventing those characters from materializing after death, because they are instantly killed once they resurrect. Yellow players are neutral, and have the option to be a trolling ♥♥♥♥♥♥, or not. They can go near player encampments without being attacked, If a yellow tagged player is killed, they do not lose their belongings, but it is always best to stay cautious when around neutral players. Neutral players can also build in and around your cities, limiting where you can build. They are also capable of stealing your crops, and your livestock, as well as anything not bolted down with locks, without any sort of reprecussions. You have no way of removing them from your area, without flagging yourself as a criminal.\n\nIt is still in Alpha testing and there are some bugs, clipping issues etc,  just from the initial experience I've had playing, Tree of Life is definitely a game to look out for as a goto crafting-survival in the future, assuming they are willing to fix some of the major flaws surrounding PVP and Griefing. I saw massive potential with Tree of Life and originally intended on giving it a thumbs up review, because I saw just how much fun the game could be. Unfortunately right now, it appears the game is overrun with a segment of the gaming community who thinks the entire game should be a pvp battleground and wants to change the nature of the game. They are also willing to attack anyone off-game, who disagrees with their interpretation of how the game should be.\n\nThe development team, while initially speaking out against griefing and abusive PVP play, have since remained quiet and appear to be hedging their bets on which way they will take the game in the future. So if you are interested in playing with others on a game where cooperation is encouraged and general ♥♥♥♥♥♥-baggery is frowned upon, this is currently not the game for you. If you are all about wallowing in a PVP Litterbox and want a game where you can free for all against other players without any serious reprecussions, even to the point of being able to play-obstruct others, in a wild west Douchefest, this game is right up your alley. Unfortuantely, If the game isn't changed to prevent player abuse, or at the very least properly labelled for the PVP Litterbox it is, there will be thousands of people very dissatisfied and disapointed with what could have been the go-to game for crafting-survival sandbox multiplayer game","June 6, 2015","false","9.1"," 168 of 230 people (73%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","73","168","230","10","20"

The few players you will find are usually griefers.\n\nIf you plan on maintaining a base in this game, try to have a group. Maintaining a base as a solo player will take you 30 mins to 1 hour daily of upkeep or you risk losing all your stuff. Even then a group of griefers could decide they don't like you and wreck everything you own.\n\nI enjoyed this game in the beginning but the slow death of the server population and the nonchalant update schedule lead me to leave this negative review.

However, almost 12 months down the road with over 1,500 testing hours under my belt, I now have my doubts.\n\nThe developers seem to have strayed away from their original vision. Rather than balancing and fixing current features, they totally change or remove them.\n\nLike other enthusiastic ToL community members who adopted this title from day one, I've now lost faith in testing this title. For me, the final nail in the coffin was yet another major exploit, in which the Devs fail to take action. A complete overhaul of base defences and raiding, which now favors griefers even more so. And, the picture painted on the official forums by the Devs regarding the delivery of a PS4, luxury meals. Well... basically living the high life. A harsh opinion? But a valid one.\n\nFrom a solo and group players point of view, content updates are by far few and exciting these days. Pointless events, when priority should focus on bug fixes and community concerns. Once you have your occupations/skills maxed and a fully built base (if you're lucky enough not to have the exploiters easily destroy it), there's little else to do but replenish arrows that are easily stolen unless you grind for materials to create top locks every 10 days! It's extremely hard to encounter other players, the 3 servers barely have 100 players between them, considering in June/July there were over 1,200! But some how I always bumped into a griefer or an exploiter.\nCommunity feedback seems to fall upon deaf ears these days. With valid community concerns receiving the occasional "Please wait a bit more"\n\nIn the past the devs have acknowledged their failings with previous Kickstarter/Beta programs. However, in my opinion have failed to learn from their mistakes.\n\nIf you're expecting an end title in the near future, I suspect you will sadly be disappointed.\nI therefore suggest you read the Steam Discussions and Official Forum before you spend your hard earned money.","November 5, 2015","false","636.5"," 64 of 80 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","64","80","3","0"

Then runs away while their flag drops. Then they run in free of attack to take/look at everything you have. If you lock your buildings they do the same thing. They lockpick and then run away for their flag to drop. Right now there is a bug that allows someone that is blue(good) to unlock your gates/buildings and as long as they don't move they won't get attacked by your 100 towers you built up. So that's what people do.\n\nWhen you do find someone that is in your city and killing your farms, workbenches, animals, etc... you kill them and then you become flagged.

Hopefully you have.  Some of you have yet to play, and are reading reviews to determine if the game is worth spending the money on.\n\nWell, as of today I'm sitting at somewhere near 250 hours played.  Hardly a long time compared to some who play this, but certainly longer than many.  I wanted to share my thoughts about the game in as objective a way as I can possibly do.  I do like the game though, so I have to be honest when I admit that I am hoping you give the game a really good shot.  I will explain.\n\nThis game is tagged as an Early Access Massively Multiplayer Survival PvP RpG Sandbox.  Now I feel it necessary to break that down a little bit to explain each part and how it pertains to Tree of Life specifically.\n\nI write this review based on my experience on the NA server.\n\nEarly Access.\nTree of Life is Early Access.  I need to stress how important it is that everyone who plays this game remembers this fact.\nWe have paid to get involved in the games development.  That has lots of perks, like getting to know the game inside and out, before it goes live, and they have told the players we get to keep our characters during any major changes that will happen through the process.  This gives long standing players a good individual advantage.  But everything with a positive, has a negative.  For example, any change they accept, or decide to do, will impact everyone.  So if they make a decision based on one persons recommendation, it affects every player.\n\nMassively Multiplayer.\nSo we all know this.  In Tree of Life, the game had thousands of players who got impatient or interested in other newer games and left Tree of Life for shinier things.  It's ok they did because now is a great time to get into the game and start building a fort for yourself.  With all the old players gone and their forts destroyed there is loads of free space to work with and start training up your skills.\n\nPvP\nThere is a very interesting PvP dynamic to the game, though due to a recent decline in player population, the PvP is really minimal.  Most of the remaining players whom I've met have no desire to cause trouble and actually focus on building care packages or helping out newbies.  The early learning curve is a bit tricky but with help from your peers, it becomes much easier.\n\nRPG\nCurrently there are limited elements for roleplaying.  There are very basic social actions and only a local chat.  This is easily circumvented with Steam friendships or voice chat amongst friends.  Not a deal breaker in my mind, though some extra chat functions would be a nice addition to the game.  I'm not sure where their goals are here but it doesn't change the fact that this game does lack many RPG elements.  There are no quests or missions and no NPC's to speak with or trade with.  Considering the game is in early access and they are still writing code, I expect this will change once they add Monster Villages to the game in the next couple weeks.\n\nSandbox\nAs far as Sandbox goes, you even get to make a shovel to dig in the sand!  You build stuff.  You build more stuff.  You gather resources and build even more stuff.  It's never ending, but that's the grind.  It isn't fun for everyone, and with the lack of other material it can become really tedious at times.  Still, I find it rewarding to make stuff for my friends or design walls of a fort.  There are certainly some enormous forts in the game.  Impressive constructions that's for sure.\n\n\nMany are concerned about Stability with an early access game.  I have only experienced one or two crashes since I started playing, and the FPS is good so long as I don't come across a fort with 30,000 sections of wall in construction.  The game has lots of potential and I know you can easily get a couple hundred hours of play.  Check out their website and official forums for more information.\n\nI want to give a rating but since I have limited experience with early access sandbox titles, my rating wouldn't be objective.  So, I'll just give it a thumbs up and hope to see you in game sometime.\n\nCheers\n\nSkrem","November 2, 2015","true","610.1"," 62 of 80 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","62","80","5","2"

Was killed by a goblin.\n\nDay 3: Some one attacked my base- I keeled them. Started building defensive watch towers. Someon stole 33 flax from my garden while i was cutting wood for arrows. Ran him down told him to drop the flax he refused i keeled him too. Recieved 7 flax seeds back.\n\nDay 4: Bought the game for another friend who intern bought the game for another then another friend bought a copy. We established large guard towers- Got griefed by the locals learned more about pvp controls and mechanics. Determined we need to start building walls.\n\nDay 5: Everyone is in linen cloth gear, with gladius swords the wall begins to erect. Together we farmed near 2000 firewood to surround what is now a base. (largest in the area) Formed a raid party and burned down the neighbors outpost. Like a warband patroled our land and evicted the unwanted. Bought the game for 2 more friends. Created a bear hunting party now everyone is in leather armor. Went fishing together caught a sword fish- I now use its snout as my primary weapon. Was cutting firewood- group of 4 on horse back attack me cause i'm red from earlier raid- I retreat back to base- they stop at the gate as 7 people rush the front door to protect me (the joy of teamspeak). Send a scout out to find rare materials and he returns with iron, sulfer and mithril. Shares a story of ogres, zombies and sheep. Friends go to bed, I go fishing again and catch a turtle, log happy with my experience for the day. Gnight steam.....\n\nUpdate 3-\n\nDay 6. Made friendly with local clans and established some material trading. Still patroling our land cut down several players without clan tagets. Bought a horse- ventured to the mist and recovered 3 sheep (two male and a female), got gutted half way back to base and they stole 120 coal from me- because I was 100% red.  Now have 3 clan regulators in full copper with saw fish swords. Sent a search party north to find a nice place to move with more advanced crafting materials. Plotted some defensible land and sent a carpenter to start building the roots of our next base. Plotted the destruction of neighboring outposts. Posted  signs outside our base threatening the locals and left signs at surrounding outposts as a warning not to mess with our guildies-Threatening retaliation. Built adition defense towers around the base. Was visited by largest clan in the game- cut down a random tresspassing on our land infront of them and made good relation.\n\nDay 7. Heading up north to help the carpenter build walls- still marked as a criminal. Lets see what today offers me :) Well the recent update made some graphical glitches on the map fortunately adjusting graphics seems to fix the problem. I have now been to every area on the map (not including  mist covered areas) Every area you can see anyhow. All the prime locations for a strong faction to build seem to be claimed. On my way back home I encountered a noob on the beach standing in a sea of already crafted and placed camp fires. I see his hands spinning and box apears on his shoulder and wouldn't you know it he placed another campfire  when he could have walked three steps in any direction and used somone elses. I dismounted my house and drew my rare pvp sword, there I was standing before him with a red name armed to the teeth.\nI say "3,000 campfires here and you craft a new one!" I start to attack him he begs me to stop and says "I'm sorry I'm just hungry! Please! Stop! ty I leave" (I hear his stomache growl). I made sure I cut him to the lowest health possible and left him to bleed to death or be eaten by wildlife. I did continplate several times going back and finishing him off for littering but stopped my self and returned to base. Found drama amongst the guildies- dealing with miscommunication and social disputes about people fighting over somone using 50-60 of somone elses resources.. Drama- a productive player burns through 1,000's of resources a day on here- (its like wood cutting simulator 2016 lol), this is some petty stuff I thought. Soon after a guildie try's to evict somone out of our resoure range- the player attacks them i hear the cry for help over teamspeak- I rush to the front gate to see somone slashing my clan mate in the back with a makeshift knife, I imediately draw my sword and he realizes that I'm after him and attempts to run- after my blade strikes his back he falls to the ground and says "sht!" I steal his loot and the player never returns. Find another untagged random testing our defenses and he ghost glitches through our front gate while its open, only to find himself in a see of towers  and spike traps with no way to exit. He logs out and never returns. Later, a guildie found a mine east of our base, It was so nice we claimed it and plan to lock the locals out, spent all night building towers around it, was alot of work. Plan on putting up walls day 8. Was approached by the "Traderz" guild and had one of them apear with threatining gear after he saw our Red names. He was contimplating robbing us I could see it in his eyes so I banked my gear and sword knowing he could probably drop us both. He pry'd at us and hovered over our work area like a vulture I finnally snapped at him and said  "Either attack us or leave! but know we are many" He peared at the monument we had erected in a day and said "Plant trees and your Red time will go faster. Good luck mate!" Then left like he wasn't stalking us or sizing us up.\n\n\nDay 8. Constructing the wall- The wall started coming up well, but distractions set in and the space we chose was expanded making it more difficult with wood requirements.. Some novice set up a guild hall 30 meters from our defensive wall- Went to evict him but he was exploiting the fact that he had the 24 hours of gameplay novice buff protection. We camped him and tagged his buildings with arrows as he ran his mouth, till he finally ran out of food. He offered to pay a land tax so we charged him a 25 wood a day fee for living there and gave him some watch tower restriction. I figured 750 wood a month per guild member was fair rent for him to be right outside our wall. However we do feel that him exploiting the 24 grace period to harrass people is wrong and will probably destroy him after his buff is gone. Really, depends on him being respectful and not building a large base next to us, he is currently keeping it outpost size and has hired us to help him with a few tasks such as killing bears for oil ect. Recruited a new guildie to farm wood for us, gave hima guild banner cloak and full leather gear, he seemed please and went right to work- Seemed like a nice guy. Made shark bait and advanced fishing poles for friend he brought me a new pvp sword :) as my other one was getting worn by my PK status. Made relations with a beach crew, they jumped in our teamspeak to hang out a bit. Some noob thought it would be funny to harass us at the mine while  we spoke with them I began to attack him and the beach crew said "Well if we do anything to bother you just let us know, we don't want any trouble." Amazing what a little violence can acheive. The noob scurried off bleeding in fear, as our guilds finished the discussion. Our new lumberjack filled the mine boxes with materials and logged. I farmed for a bit and crafted tons of linen for leather armor. Went around and advertised it for sale- 25 copper per peice- 100 copper for full suit - 100 copper cloaks and 100 copper for copper weapons.

Also to leave a message you have to be proactive in the forums, and the website specifically states "an eye for an eye" so instead of not having a lockpicking feature, or deleting accounts from people who want to destory everything, you have to become bad yourself and waste time destorying more things.

The control system has clearly been designed with future mobile support in mind which tends to make it a little bit counter intuitive; it still needs to be polished. There are also some annoying bugs that are hard to pin down, such as tooltips failing to work and so forth. All of these however are to be expected for an early access game and shouldn't discourage anyone from trying the game out.\n\nThere are, however, several key design flaws to the gameplay that lead me to not recommend getting this game while it is still in earlier access. My wife and I tried playing together and found that anything we built was most likely destroyed the next time we logged in. It was also almost impossible to find open land to build on as the world is quite crowded. In addition to the frustration of having anything you build be destroyed there are many situations that can arise in the gameplay that can prevent you from being able to play.\n\nI logged in after having not played in two weeks and found myself inside someone's base. I can't escape the base in any way. I didn't want to try to knock down any walls as I did not want to develop a criminal record. After waiting for a long time hoping a player with access to the base would open the gate I conceded that I would have to try to knock down a wall to escape, despite not wanting a criminal record. I am unable to attack any part of the walls, however, without being quickly killed by the base's arrow towers. I am now effectively stuck in the base with no way to escape or play the game. Until these types of large design flaws are addressed I would advise against paying for this game.","June 27, 2015","false","53.5"," 46 of 60 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","46","60","4","0"

Quirky, laid back music, practicing Wing Chun on trees, punching veins, punching Chickens, punching Kobolds, getting punched by Zombies. Makes punching better than Minecraft!\n\n\nOkay, let's get serious.\n\nFor an early access game, I did not expect much. Being a huge fan of sandbox games, Tree of Life holds a lot of promise and the game is already delivering. So far, I have not encountered any bugs and/or glitches in the game, which surprises me. If music is a big deal for you, then this game is just right. Truth be told, if I can get my hands on Tree of Life's soundtrack, I'd buy it. 10/10. It's that good.\n\nAs far as the community in the game goes, I'm fortunate enough to have friends who actually play the game, but I've met some pretty cool people so far and have had little conflict with others. If roleplaying is your thing, there are some villages that encourage roleplay. If you just want to play the game as is, there's always that too. There's already a lot to do in the game, so I'm excited to see what else the devs have in store for us!\n\nThe only thing I don't like is that there's a delay when you're trying to switch to a bandage after swinging a melee weapon. Granted, this isn't much of a big deal and can easily adjust to, but I don't know if it's intentional to make the game semi-realistic or if there's just a delay.

Community base building is required and it's easy to make friends because peeps are friendly. Getting food is really easy to keep up with as in for now.\n\n-PVP: Game has an MMORPG system of red/Yellow names. If you kill someone or destroy anything you end up having a red name and if someone kill you while red you will drop everything. On the other hand if you r a yellow name you would only drop one item and it's usually stick or pants. It's fun when it's group vs group in the EU server. You also don't respawn but turn into a ghost thing to come back to the place you at. There is blocking and shield bash or parry not sure yet.\n\n-NOTE: There is an ideal balance between PVP and PVE, mostly PVE though like GRAV game style. Unlike other survival games, you would feel safe in Tree of Life.\n\n-GRAPHICS: I like to zoom in real close to my char in this game while running and attack, playing general and it's real nice and colorful. The game looks like a new Runescape and zelda thing. I disliked how it looked over Youtube videos at first but the art style is just fit in game. Players male models are huge tho.\n\n-OPTIMIZATION: The game doesn't feel like an early access game what so ever.\n\n-END GAME: White iron armor is beautiful with an axe and you can ride bulls. Map is huge and progressing along with other players killing mobs is quite fun. Grinding and leveling up everything is noticeable is worth a while, Tree of Life might seem like a standard, open-world survival, but there are a few gameplay mechanics and ideal decisions made that make it perfect. Players and friends have what seem to be an endless map to explore while constructing shelter bases and keeping peace still to survive. The world is harsh and PVP is worse, this is why leveling stats is worth a while to protect your potato farm.\n\n-NOTE: Devs listen. All though they didnt fade the map as a suggestion of mine.

What did surprise me was an incredible early access game, that has had me playing for nearly 6-7+ hours a day since the minute I added it to my Steam Library. The game, at first glance, seems typical of most survival type early access games currently on the market, and you would think the only difference is it's choice in art style, well.. that's not quite the case. This game, is relatively similar to other survival games (ie. Build a base, sustain it, defend it, pvp, raid, etc.) but, it has some great RPG elements, like actual leveling up, hard stats such as INT, STR, DEX and CONS that most of us RPG players are used to. The game has a kind of Runescape mixed with Rust type of vibe to it, it seems very open ended with no short of things to do and I personally love it.

Making it interesting to see where and how communities will grow up along the world later on in the long run.\n\n-I haven't progressed too much with the skill system this far. But I see that reaching different professions will take a good while and a lot of time spent on each skill. An interesting way to go about the development of your character.\n\n-Sadly enough I haven't manage to get much further with the game to experience and learn about other positive things, and I'll tell ya why.\n\n-------Negative-------\n\n-Oh boy, here we got a few negative things to worry about. First off, I see that the developers wants the players to figure out pretty much.. everything through their first hour into the game. And yes I know there's a few guides to read to help ya out. But even the help of the guides can still make things seem confusing to understand. Especially when you wanna start out right away. There's no simple way to indicate what you exactly have to do to start making that.. that.. that and that. You get my drill. Once you start experimenting, you eventually start to understand how things works. Tho it's not an easy guess at first and can become a little frustrating for some.\n\n-I found myself at the end of my first game session very frustrated and somewhat disappointed. Throughout my session I found myself constantly being attacked by invisible creatures. Both under day and night time. Most of the time I heard skeleton rumbling noises approaching and then the situation would proceed with me losing tons of health, one hit at the time. Forcing me to leave my current settlement... forever. I experienced this on the EU server and from the little I read in the discussion thread not long after the end of my game session, other people had experienced the same problem. It's a very huge issue that must be dealt with immediately! The game is practically unplayable at this time. As you can't see or attack these invisible creatures! Very disappointed to see an NPC being bugged. Perhaps? Especially at this time at the launch on Steam.\n\n-And of course, just as I spawned in at the very beginning, I were attacked by another player. Not saying it's a complete negative issue. After all, it's a mix of MMO and PVP. Perhaps it's just me who doesn't like being attacked just as I spawn in, into a new game that I've never played before..\n\n-------First experience conclusion-------\n\nSo far the game feels promising and it has potential to improve a lot. Tho, the major issues such as the invisible creatures must be dealt with as soon as possible. 50% of the experience is being ruined due to this problem and making it somewhat unplayable right now. Especially if you wanna settle down somewhere.\nTho, as I have looked forward to this game for some time now, I can't go too harsh on it. It's still in development and I hope the developers fix and update the game often to improve it's current.. minor issues.\n\n-That's all I had to say, hope this little review helped!-","May 27, 2015","true","48.9"," 41 of 57 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","41","57","3","0"

It's painful to read through the itemnames and descriptions. It's easy to see what the items are, but its still painful.\n-You can walk up 75 degree cliffs.\n-Trolls and greifers are existent. It's a sandbox MMO, and early access at that, so it's inevitable. But tolerable.\n-Crafting is a GRIND! But not intolerably so.\n-There needs to be more early storage options. Chests and whatnot.\n\nThe Good:\n\nNow for the good parts!\n\n-Music is AMAZING. Feels like your playing harvest moon the whole time, and doesn't feel repetitive.\n-The PvP, in my opinion, is spot on. While a lot of people are complaining about it, it's not as big a deal as they are making it out to be. It is annoying to die, but you only lose one item.\nIf you're of average intelligence, you won't be baited into turning yourself into pvp-flagged.\n-Crafting feels USEFUL.\n\n\nIt's a great game if your playing with people, but I can tell that it would be a giant pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to play alone.\nDon't buy this game if you get irritated quickly, can't relax, or take the time to enjoy the little things.","May 29, 2015","true","35.5"," 35 of 48 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","35","48","2","0"

I believe they do much better of a job giving a idea of how the game is in its current state along with how I feel. Like many other people I feel that this game is a tad bit enjoyable for the social aspect along with having a interesting path to make the game really enjoyable as a PVE sandbox. The addition of NPC towns and NPC raids makes me rather hopeful that at one point the creators could even include basic open world dugeons to keep things interesting.\n\nAt this point, there really is only the bar bones in the game to waist your time on. You grind and grind the same buildings or objects to gain level while those items have very little useable value when you are making a small place for yourself. The first town I was ever a part of had dozens of stoves, campfires, work benchs, and other such buildings just cluttering up the space we had. This is slightly an okay system as later levels of crafting seems to be designed to work off one another's talents. An example is to have one person a high enough carpenter to create a blacksmith station for someone to take over making weapons and some armor. That same person or another can create the tailor station, walls, and other buildings to let people focus on speciality roles. The whole system just feels so simple while also being unique to bring communities together.\n\nThe PVE in the game is so interesting and refreshing that I have to regret that I can't give the game a good rating at this time. At this time, it seems like the majority of the game is plagued by grefers that exploit flaw and bugs to become a pain. This is why I would suggest looking through a few of the discussions that is littered all over the fourms to get an idea of the different groups and how bad they are for one another. It gets to the point that I can't even agree with the people who would rather see the game try and fix the criminal flagging system. There are still a few indiviuals that I believe have the right idea and want to see a more balanced approach, but at this moment I would hold off two months if not more before checking back on the pop/attitude that is in the game at that moment. I'm stuck with the game at the moment because of the grind that caused me to go way over the two hour limit that is on the return policy at the time. I'll just keep this one on the shelf until then and change my review if things change for the better.\n\nEdit:\nOdd, it seems like my last revision didn't stick for some reason. The only thing to take from what I had to say is that some of the positive reviews from the first week of the game release was due to a promotion that the company was having. This is kind of a slight worning and explination on why some of the positive reviews may be simple one line messages that says nothing about the game itself.\n\nI mentioned earlier about there being better reviews to look up for pros and cons on the game. Well, two of the reviews that seemed to paint a nice picture ended up somehow way below in the rating. It might be good to just follow the links to see them since I really think they should be above mine.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007267429/recommended/361800/\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198075701885/recommended/361800/\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/361800/discussions/0/598198173700021203/","June 7, 2015","false","21.5"," 50 of 75 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","50","75","4","0"

Building is fun and requires a lot of work. You need to level up your skills to unlock new crafting in the game. you need to also really search for the items you need to progress in the game also.\n\nFor dislikes you need to eat every 2 mins or less unless you lose your stanima and you can't really do much. With there being one server for NA finding food can be hard to do. As for the fighting I chose to saying fighting and not PvP, bacause it is hard to target to kill anything... There are times where I am swinging and not hitting do to me not able to target the mob or person. It's wrose when people are raiding you and they are standing still looting your stuff and you can't even lock on to hit them. It also doesn't help when theres one server and it being a new game (well not really new just in Beta not alpha anymore.)\n\nUnless I am missing something when it comes to fighting and trageting mobs...But until they get it fixed I can't recommend this game to anyone since this is a PvP/sandbox type of game.","April 18","false","14.2"," 70 of 110 people (64%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","64","70","110","8","8"

You'll be hard pressed to enjoy the game without either playing with friends, or making friends, because anyone can come up and take your hard earned stuff. Plus, it takes ages to build your skills up to do even the most basic things.

Your typical MMO stats (HP, MP, Energy) are increased through the leveling of your own personal skills. For example, every level of the Farming and Unarmed skill you rank up, you gain 1 CON(stitution) in turn which increase your health by one point. That may seem mundane but skills level up relativley fast in this MMO and you are rewarded a bonus stat of the same or different attribute every four levels.\n\nProgression and technology is not an easy thing to obtain therefore requiring cooperation on small to massive scales, and because of the way these mechanics are set up, players are unusally friendly and helpful! Beware though, most will stop at nothing to take revenge if you steal from them, especially those with their own guild. You dont need ten people to start a succesful group in this game, infact with that many people it may be hard to start out, given that Food is a serious requirment in this MMO. Yes, I know, an MMO that requires food? I realize that no one signed up to play farmville, but agriculture and hunting/foarging is another aspect of this game. Being hungry doesnt lead to you dying, rather it reduces your Stamina, chance to dodge and move speed. In a game as large and dangerous as this one, the loss of those three stats is crippling. On the bright side, food is not hard to come by in the least.\n\n\nFor the price of $22 Canadian Dollars, i feel like this game was a steal.\nFarewell and goodluck travellers, I hope to see you in game!","May 31, 2015","true","136.0"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","23","30","0","1"

This leads to opening new skills to learn and use.\n+Charming Art style.\n+World is HUGE. I spent my first 3 hours only on the "Starter" Island I spawned on.\n+Tons of room for depth. While still in early access I'm excited to see what the devs can come up with.\n+Decent Price, only 20 USD.\n+Possibility for great communities. In my first 2 minutes I found a friendly group of players and joined them in creating our own little settlement. Mileage may vary for you of course.\n\nCons:\n-I haven't had a problem with it, but people being attacked by invisible monsters is a huge problem at the moment.\n-While I haven't encountered lag, monster seem to act a bit weird. The Tree spirit things in particular seem to whoosh all around including clipping into the ground a bit.\n-Combat is a bit clunky and needs some work. Without a guild/friend system (Planned not implemented) to turn off Friendly Fire (unsure if the system will turn this off) the game tends to be a russian roulette of please hit the monster and not my friend.\n-GRIND GRIND GRIND. You will be chopping trees, for precious apples and firewood for a long time. Not only does the games stamina system limit you, but you need SO MUCH.\n-Day/Night cycle. When you start out, Night it death. Zombies and Skeletons spawn in the night and will murder you senseless. Thankfully they stay away from light, so a campfire will help keep you safe. This limits you to only gathering resources at first during the day, which doesn't last very long. This cycle end up meaning that you run out as soon as dawn breaks and gather as much as you can to run home before dusk to hide by the fire. My least favorite part of this is how it limits and terrible slows exploration.\n-The only true bug I experienced was when I first logged on, none of my crafting recipes or items had tooltips. I even thought this was how it was supposed to be. Guessing at what made what. It seemed cool at first but quickly got annoying as I tried to figure out what I picked up. A quick relog managed to fix this problem after a friend informed me that, yes tooltips existed. Which leads into...\n-No hand holding. The game drops you in and says go at it! I don't consider this much of a con, but when you have meters that you have no clue what they represent (Looking at you Brain thing.) You can't help but wonder if you are missing out of an entire part of the game. How do you progress your skills? What does everything do? If I build this what will it let me accomplish? All of these are left to discover, which can be fun, but to some tedious.\n-Death timers. When you die, you become a ghost that gets to float about for 3 minutes unless you find the soul things. 3 minutes seems super steep, and design around PvP seige aspects. Dying to a bear that you and a few friends decided you could take results in 3 minutes of time out.\n\nWow, that seems like a lot more cons than pros, but honestly so many of the cons are my own personal preferences or can and hopefully will be fixed by the devs. I love the idea of what they are doing here and can't wait to explore some more in this game.\n","May 27, 2015","true","6.1"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","19","23","0","0"

There is lots land available now for the settlement of newborns and the monsters' sieges are weaker than before. The cases of gangsters' raids are less than before as too many players quitted, now, the island is popular with the killers. Although the crime system is introducted, it is really useless for the safe of newborns and even skilled players. Why?\n\nThe killers are going to seek more victims, do more burglaries and even demolishment, as their crime score is reached the peak. Few of players can challenge the killers who armed with the top level weapons and armors and living in strongholds, so the killers do not care about the penalty. That is why newborns are no chance to do self-defence or revenge. Also, most locks in the game are crap, the killers with top level lockpicking can open most locks easly like taking a pee in their home.\n\nIn conclusion, no place is safe for newborns even staying in their sweet home. I hope my report can help people know much about the recent of the game.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n12th June 2015\n\nNo matter how you love the tree of life, your sweet home is attacked by sustained monsters' siege day by day and even  gangsters' raids with notorious massacres and fulled of insulting jokes. Being frustrated, that's why so many newborns have quited the game gradually since last week and no more new broadcasting in the twitch.\n\nThe game is playable, but only for the offspring of The Viking or The Hun now,  they can do what their ancestry felt free to do a challenge to the civilization.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpaceHamsterGames/recommended/361800/","SpaceHamsterGames","SpaceHamster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpaceHamsterGames/","340 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n"Overwhelmingly Positive" the reviews on Steam right now. To be fair my friends and I (I bought a 4-pack) only played the game for about 4 hours last night. Simplistically I could say that this game is not ready, it seems as though the developers want the players to figure literally everything out about their game as there is no rhyme or reason to a lot of the decisions made about the current state of the game.\n\nThe first thing you'll do is spawn somewhere on the island (which we believe was decided by the ship you choose in the beginning, so if you want to play with your friends faster, coordinate), when you spawn you won't have any idea where to go or what's going on. That's not necessarily a bad thing, you figure out the game on your own, at your own leisure. You skill up by doing different things, aka to get better with swords you would keep using swords to hit things, which is a neat system admittedly, but you immediately notice that this game is going to turn into a grind fest, and not only that but you have a limited number of skill points, so eventually you're going to have to choose a few key skills that you want to stick with. I think that's because they want you to group up and essentially build a town with other players, which is admittedly a cool concept, but I wouldn't expect to be able to do that right away.\n\nEnemies are incredibly strong right away and there's no health regen unless you're well fed or have a bandage (WHICH IS REALLY HARD EARLY ON), expect a lot of really cheesy deaths. Luckily the death system is pretty forgiving. You don't really drop anything (unless you're a criminal) and you turn into a ghost for a few minutes and spawn where your ghost is, you can keep moving around and position yourself in a safer place. It doesn't really matter though because unless you're rolling around with 3-4 people, the beginning enemies are going to slaughter you. There's also this really terrible chance mechanic in the game where if you're hitting a tree to gather wood that there's a chance a Tree Ent will spawn when you're about to finish chopping it down. So not only does it waste your time sitting there chopping, you're then punished for doing a necessary action, that is probably the FIRST action any new player is going to do. The Tree Ent is way stronger than you right when you start, so unless you're totally ready for it, it's probably going to kill you, which means you're out of the game for three minutes.\n\nCombat is really glitchy and wonky, it's trying to go for a 3rd person action/combat mmo feel, except early on is not indicative of what will actually be apart of the game. For now it seems like you have melee weapons, and melee weapons consists of sitting in front of the enemy and rapidly clicking to do damage. If you try any funny business, like running around and trying to actually 'get into' the game by moving around and fighting (PVP style), you're punished because the game doesn't apparently have a true "free" targeting system. Instead you're better off standing completely still because the game has to highlight the creature and THEN you can click to do damage. If you run around and try to get into it the game punishes you because you won't be able to target the creature or player easily, BUT the creature can totally target you during all of this, so unless you're running away it's not worth it because the creature will perpetually attack you while that's happening. So you're left sitting perfectly still so you can optimally attack a creature. Not very fun. The best strategy that some friends and I adopted was to gang up on an enemy. Have someone with high life tank the first couple hits, stand perfectly still and then have the other people run up and start wailing on it. It's the most efficient way of doing things early on, unless you want to be a ghost for the majority of your time playing.\n\nThe crafting itself is pretty standard affair. You can craft a few things in your hands but otherwise you will need specialized workbenches to do the majority of your crafting. Not necessarily a bad thing, but also not really anything new. The hardest part will come with finding out how to get your skills to level up to some necessary levels to keep continuing down your chosen path. A lot of the time you need to level up your skills in order to unlock things you can craft... okay not really a bad thing... at first... when everything is attainable to new players. What this essentially means though is that you will gather a bunch of supplies, realize that you want to make this better thing that actually helps you 'progress', but you can't because your 'tinkering' or 'carpentry' skills aren't a high enough level. So you actually waste all the supplies you've spent gathering building things you already have! Which means you have to go back out during the day, gather a bunch more supplies and keep making the things you already have so that you can level up your skills to get to the 'new and better' things.\n\nThis is all amplified to a worse degree when you realize that you are completely incapable of combat at the beginning of the game. All of the monsters are incredibly strong early on, there doesn't seem to be any real distinguishable zones either. Which means that it seems like there's a lot of the same stuff everywhere, and it's also a really huge world. All of this is amplified AGAIN when you realize there's a day and night cycle, and at nighttime the enemies come out (all of which are stronger then you), forcing you to literally sit around a campfire for about 15 minutes or longer? I'm not sure how long the day/night cycles are, but Nighttime lasts WAAAAY too long (at least for anyone starting out) forcing you to essentially stop everything you're doing until daytime when most of the enemies will die to the sunlight. You could start a fire, which seems to scare off a lot of the night time enemies (we're not sure though?). But firewood doesn't last NEARLY long enough, one firewood lasts about 20 seconds or so, so a fire will literally suck your supply of wood out of you in a single night, WHAT... WHY?!\n\nYou can tell this game is not made for anyones convenience right now, I believe the only reason that I had fun playing the game was because I was playing with my friends, that's more than half of the game right there. The beginning of the game is so slow. It does at least pick up a little bit once you get into building a few things and you start farming (like actually start a farm) a little bit, but It's a hard game to recommend to anyone right now. Do not trust the other reviews, they are being far too kind. This game would be hard to recommend even months from now when (HOPEFULLY) they fix a lot of these issues and flesh out the early game and progression a lot more. It seems like this game could be totally awesome... like two years from now. For now just add it to the pile of unfinished early access survival games. Wait. Just wait. WAIT to see if the developers actually make changes, do not give them your money, do not give them your money for the CHANCE that this game will be good.","May 28, 2015","false","0.2"," 67 of 112 people (60%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","60","67","112","9","4"

A small grind but not too terribly bad as you do not want to get max level overnight since no real things to do at max level are in place as of yet.\n\nYou get to build your village and craft and explore different atmospheres. Run around to find areas where certain materials to craft with spawn. Meet interesting people and make trades, work together and have community. The music is straight out of castleville and so are the graphics, but if you are looking for a game that is amusing this is it.\n\nNote all the reviews before 6/18 that are negative, they are people complaining about everything getting destroyed by pvpers and griefers. The devs listened to the players and did something about that. Now you will notice all of the huehue's and pvpers are crying and thumbs down.

I did not expect myself to be even interested in playing this game, but after around two hours, I started to enjoy it.\n\nPROS:\n\n~The core concept and overall gameplay of the game - Playing with friends I feel is what makes the game, however, your views may differ if you're just playing it by yourself.\n\n~Crafting is interesting and develops very well as your skills level (there are tons of skills in this game that improve over time)\n\n~The game world is huge and dynamic - this allows for you and your friends to find the perfect spot to gather materials and build up your town and trading posts and thrive within your group/guild. Word will spread of those who come around and destroy villages which then emphasises more teamwork to bolster your defenses to prevent destruction to all your hard work.\n\nCONS: (This game is obviously in early access, but I feel I should point out some cons that I have noticed)\n\n~Very unoptimized - I get an average of 22-29 fps in this game (with my 4.0GHz i7 4790, and GTX 970 @ 1504MHz  on core clock)\n\n~Graphics aren't the greatest - this could be an issue to some, but I have faith that the game will improve greatly while still mainting the art style that is trying to be achieved.\n\nIf you and your friends are looking for a good group-oriented game to play, I would highly recommend it. I hope to see the developers continue to improve this game as it has a lot of potential.","June 18, 2015","true","55.2"," 26 of 38 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","26","38","0","0"

The game naturally has bugs and things that need improving, the non skill progression of shields and 2h swords is a little frustrating. My biggest personal issue is the limitation to guild sizes, the effect this has on community's playing the game is massive.\n\nFull review\n\nGraphics - cartoonish by nature which will not be too everybodys taste, i personally have no issue with it and like the art design.\n\nPerformance - seems to be mixed from my experience, i have a decent pc however there is some delay or desync present where players or mobs pass with the fighting happening a number of meters away, overall its ok but there is clearly server issues.\n\nMap - Certainly large enough to accommodate lots of players, the game has a decent mmo feel about it.\n\nFeatures - Lots, i like the PvP mechanics, although it needs work, i like the crafting as well as the city building, there is plenty to do, the skill progression is decent levelling via use is also good.","May 30, 2015","true","112.9"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

I have seen lots of player built stuff that no one is using.  in my 13 hours of playing this game I have seen four other players.  It has some rough points about keeping your stuff safe and I think the day night cycle is to short.  The crafting is fun, but would take some planning with your friends as you seem to need something from nearly all of the crafting skills to make items.  I think with some updates it could be a great game to play with a group of people really hard solo.  In its current state however I can not recommend buying it.  I would wait until some more content comes out as of right now :I have not seen any monster villages or dungeons but I dont think that is in the game yet.

It's reminiscent of another indie game, "Haven and Hearth," where you group together with other people and build a community but feels more polished and with more support.  The community of people seems really friendly as in one night we made friends with two groups nearby.  I've only been killed by one player thus far, and more people just seem happy enough to be left alone and leave you alone in exchange.\n\nThat being said, I'd have to say that there's a few things that should be worked on.  One thing that would benifit this game would be some sort of system of "permanent lighting" to discourage night-time mobs from spawning in certain areas as you're developing a town.  Bonfires are great at the start for keeping players huddled from the darkness, but there needs to be a more permanent lighting source I feel.  That, or it needs some way to discourage mobs from attacking your gates and walls all the time.\n\nThe reason I say this, is because if it's not implemented, you'll spend a good amount of time building arrows rather than upgrading your town, battleing, or exploring.  While the game is certainly "early access," it was fun until I spent roughly 10-15 hours maintaining what I've built.  Another issue with this game for interested refunders, is it'll take about 5-10 hours to get to a point where you can make an accurate assessment on whether you like the game on the offset, then an additional 10 hours to see if it's something you want to continue investing in.\n\nI'd recommend this game for mid-heavy sandboxers with community-friendly ideals.  I definately wouldn't suggest this for "lone wolves" as you'll most likely be out-numbered, or not be able to have such an excellent set of skills to survive by one-self at end game (definately seems more fun with friends anyhow).  I would say hold off and see where the game goes (especially in the protecting your stuff against monsters while you're at work/sleep).  If I could I'd get a refund and then watch the game, but alas I'm outside the window.\n\nIt'll be an amazing community/society building game at some point, but it isn't there yet.","June 3, 2015","true","30.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

This reduces the KoS mentality of most survival games I've seen. This is a pretty big plus imo. First game I've seen where large groups of people will just come together and start helping with very few people trying to grief.\n\nCons: I can definitely see groups closing doors to outsiders very fast if Guild player limits aren't increased. Solo play is possible at the lowest level but the limit of skill points used will probably rear its ugly head for high tier crafting for solo players. Griefing and the lack of punishment is a very big issue right now. Someone ransacking your goods? Too bad! If you kill him you go red name. He drops 1 piece of loot as punishment while you run around for 2 hours as a KoS target to strangers. It's especially bad if you have good gear you don't want to lose.\n\nTLDR: Game is alpha and the latest patch on day 3 release is definitely a good sign. But $20 is just too steep for this game in its current state. If you have $20 to burn, I would Definitely Recommend it. For everyone else, wait until the game is in a balanced state.","May 29, 2015","false","33.2"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","23","39","0","2"

It's good fun, rather rough around the edges, but I think it was worth the fifteen bucks we spent on it(we sprung for that four pack, you see).\n\nBy rough, I mean that with the game basically just having come out, figuring out how to do anything is kind of difficult, and there's not much of a way to ask. Mostly I just gathered stuff and ran around shanking things with bone daggers while my friends did most of the crafting stuff. Combat is kind of clunky with how the game sometimes doesn't lock you on to enemies, letting them get in several cheapshots while you dance around him trying to get the game to lock on, and the enemies rather annoyingly circle-strafe you which, as I said, is just annoying and doesn't add any real difficulty to anything. Some materials seem kind of hard to come by; tin has been a recurring issue since for some reason instead of having rocks containing tin you can only find the stuff from the corpses of dead sailors(which are faaaaairly rare, I guess). The night is pitch black, which while realistic, is frustrating because you can often get jumped by enemies and have no clue what's going on, and you can't have a torch in your hand with a weapon, so you end up fighting blind at night. On top of that, light sources(namely bonfires) are hard to maintain through the night and don't put off all that much light anyways, making them kind of useless. A few times enemies have attacked us that didn't actually appear on other player's screens, which is mind-boggling. There's several other niggling little details, but at that point I'd just be nitpicking.\n\nNow, it should be reiterated that we've only played the game for six hours; some of this might just be my inexperience speaking, but the whole package is rather unpolished in a number of ways. Expected? Sure, this is an early access game. But hey, if I don't list the problems I've had they won't get fixed, right? On the whole, though, I DID enjoy my time with the game so far, and will likely play the game more in days to come, and wholeheartedly look forward to what they'll do with the thing in the future. I'd say pick it up now and play it. S'only 20 bucks, and if you get three friends to pitch in for the 4-pack it's only 15. Not a bad price for what's already here, I'd say.\n\nIn summation: Yeah, I recommend the game. :D","May 28, 2015","true","265.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It has it's share of problems but it's in the works and I'm sure they will eventually be smoothed out.\n\nThe crafting system is pretty in depth, there's lots of stuff to craft, lots of material farming.

Game is about impossible to play at night.  You can't see anything and lights do little to remedy this.  It's just unrealistically dark and the days go by far too quickly to get much done so you're pretty much required to sit and do nothing on several occasions.\n\nThis is not a bad game and is showing a lot of potential, I mainly write out this review in hopes that it might be seen by the developers and perhaps look into some of the issues the game currently has and tweak them a bit.  I'll definitely be staying to play.","May 31, 2015","true","14.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

However, the game is overflowing with what you would expect in an open sandbox game, griefers, thieves. Whatever you want to call them, they will stomp all over anything you are working on, with the game giving little to no opportunities as it is to protect yourself. Enjoy watching that livestock you painstakingly gathered get slaughtered by someone who was bored. Enjoy watching all your days materials get stolen overnight by a group of folks who trashed all your storage while you were asleep. That's pretty much what you can expect from the game as is. It's truly unfortunate because there is a lot to love underneath all that grime. I'll never understand why people do this kind of thing in these games, because all it does is drive off everyone else who could help breathe some life into the world, but it is what it is.\n\nPros:\n+Gameplay is solid\n+Enjoyable RPG elements to professions\n+Lot of fun to see teamwork pay off\n+Combat works relatively well\n\nCons:\n-Need at least 10 people to make a functional town. Small groups will suffer from griefers and material grind.\n-Current system punishes indiscriminately, meaning you can't kill a thief without becoming a criminal yourself.\n-Locks, Towers and other measures to defend your town do not work yet (mostly just don't work WELL enough).\n-Overflowing with griefers.\n\nFinal Verdict: The game itself is great fun with friends, ruined by a particular subset of players. Stay away unless that is what you are into. As it is the game is a firm thumbs down until the devs improve systems to allow players who want to focus on town building an ability to survive.\n\nUpdate with patch notes: So they just released a patch today that adds thief criminal status and makes it easier to get defenses up around the town. It does not fix everything that I listed in my review, however, it does show that they are taking steps in the right direction to address common issues players may face. I will say this, even with all the negative stuff I put in about the game, I still am playing it. So take that for what you will, you will deal with the negative element in the game, but the gameplay is worthwhile if you're okay with that. Changing my review to a thumbs up with the devs doing exactly what needed to be done to fix the game, good on you.","May 28, 2015","true","48.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

I was looking to buy another game when I decided to check out the last few months of smaller releases, along with hearing from a few people that the game was the most fun they have had in an online rpg since Ultima Online (which is sitll to this day, my fav mmo by a long shot).\n\nThis has a very good community from the 10-11 hours I have played of it so far, fun gameplay and is in pretty good shape for an Early Access game. Sort of a mix between Ultima Online, DayZ, 7 days to die, Minecraft and a bunch of its own aspects. Can't wait to see what is added to this game in the future but so far it is very very very enjoyable and so far more worth the money than Ark has been.\n\nThe graphics might not be that good and might throw some people off, but give it a try or check out some videos and youll see it really is a game to keep an eye out on. There are some bugs to as to be expected with EA games, but to be honest I am pretty surprised at the level of the game this early on. Want to go back to the days when you built villages/cities with your build members and had to defend it and your teammates no matter the cost? Everything is player made, there is fighting or crafting to specialize in to when you join a guild. Grab a friend or two and give this game a go! So far, it is very good!\n\nWhen I first saw a few screenshots I thought "Ultima Online? What?". But now having played it I can see why some people mention UO. Teamwork is rewarded, the guild aspect is already well implimented (even early on) and its just a blast to play. Also pretty stable and decently optimized for an early version of the game. See you all in the gameworld and don't hesitate to msg me for the coordinates for the guild village I am in.\n\nNice little game that flew under the radar for me and I am sure many others, if you want an enjoyable online rpg that doesn't hold your hand and has aspects of mmos of yester year, give this a try!","June 4, 2015","true","16.1"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

With that said there have been a lot of people bashing on the devs for some of the things they have both added and tooken away form this game. In my opinion the game is pretty solid and can only get better. It really focuses toword the PvE side of things and at the moment !strongly! goes against most forms of PvP such as stealing, griefing, random killing, etc.. etc.. While I for one enjoy the PvE side of things, I do at the same time feel for those who do come to play the game for its PvP potenital. Given time, I am sure a system would be put into place so that guilds could go to war with one another. With that said, the game is extremely PvE friendly, and leans toword getting people to work together to form a community of crafters, farmers, gathers, soldiers, etc.. I for one would love to see a good mix of PvE and PvP in the game. Both help to keep things interesting but finding a balance to help keep players on both sides happy could be fairly difficult with the current checks and balances.\n\nAll in all, the game is fun and enjoyable. It will keep you busy for hours as you and your friends build, explore, fight, and grow along with many other players.\n\n8/10 Keep up the good work devs.","June 19, 2015","true","184.2"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

Building towers is worthless because all you need to do is have bandages on your hotbar because healing has NO cooldown which bring me to PVP. Whoever has the most bandages crafted is going to win.\nI see many people quitting this game the moment their base is gone because a huge guild of reds (criminals) and there’s nothing you can do to defend it. Going red is so worth it to them because 24h is the max till they become normal again so they destroy a whole base(days to build) and only one day to become normal again. There should be a limit to how much you can destroy of another person’s things the moment you become red and the wait time is when you become yellow(friendly) again.

Has the basic elements of crafting that make a sandbox-esque game enjoyable. I like that people are able to work together to build things, and there are cool little things like the immersive, roleplay style chat system where when you're incapacitated/turned into a ghost from dying, you get garbled text output.\n\nThings I don't like, that I expect are relatively easy to change or improve--\n\nThe hit boxes for combat are awful. If I end up fighting an enemy that moves even a little bit, suddenly i'm no longer focused and my attacks don't connect at all, which is not something I think has any place in an open-world 3d fighting setup. Swinging a weapon should check the hit boxes in general, not whether you're focused on them. I get killed by weak enemies due to this.\n\nThe character animations could use some improvement, as of now they remind me of n64 duke nukem style animations.\n\nEntering crafting menus and any kind of storage units are, like the aforementioned hit boxes, really 'stiff', they aren't very easy to access. The right click and drag is neat, as it allows you to cancel your menu with mouseup, but I think in order for it to be smooth and enjoyable its better to adjust the camera so that in third person you treat things like it. At the moment it treats it as if my character needs to look at it, so theres this awkward way I have to offset it to get proper focus onto a target.\n\nSince this is a new game I'm hoping the devs stay on it and continue to improve it. Me and my relatively large group of friends will all likely be long-time players if they continue to add content and polish the game. If I have any suggestion besides the things above, its to make sure to add 'content'. By that, I mean plenty of neat new items and such to check out. Plenty of neat variations in the world, like biomes. I also like to decorate quite a bit, so please don't skip out on the items that don't have a practical use besides looking nice or creating a setting =)\n\nGood job on getting it this far, I look forward to seeing it improve.","May 30, 2015","true","13.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I am enjoying my time by finding a group of people who were willing to let me join them. The game is okay to play alone but there are some aspects you're going to want a group for.\n\nIf you build something, make sure you break it down and put it into your inventory when you log off. This game suffers the big thing that most games suffer from, the community. If you're trying to play alone, I can guarantee someone is going to come by and destroy or steal just about everything you have. The good thing though is that unlike most of these other survival games around, when you log off, people can't kill your sleeping body and take your inventory and housing stays broken for quite a long time so if someone breaks your house, you can easily log on the next day, break it down and get your loot.\n\nYour character will not have enough points to distribute into every skill of the game, which is fine but limits solo play if that's what you're looking for. It seems best to take up 1-2 weapon skills and the rest be put into crafting of some kind. You're going to have to rely on a guild if you want a good defensible land, good armor, weapons and items.\n\nThe mobs/monsters will break your defenses down really quickly and don't even think about fighting anything when you first start out. Except rats and livestock, you're good there. It's hard enough to keep a couple of people on at all times to have to worry about players but the mobs can just let them inside of your fort within a couple of minutes. I haven't gotten to stone walls yet, just the wooden ones so I'm assuming that will help with this issue.\n\nThe game controls very easily, it's easy to learn and it is pretty easy so far as I have found to find a group of people who will be willing to run around with as long as you pull your own weight. Even if you were to be wiped out, it's easy enough to build your stock back up with a couple of hours of gameplay.\n\nAll in all. I would suggest getting this game. It's easy to play, there is plenty to do and there will only be more content added at this point and mostly, it's fun. Just get some friends if you plan on playing heavily.","May 31, 2015","true","8.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It challenges the player to either make trustworthy friends to cooperate with, or go it alone with all the dangers of having no one to watch your back. Yes, there are raiders; some demand tribute, some just want anything not tied down to the ground, and some kill and destroy for fun -- but it doesn't rule your experience. You can store, lock up things, and repair easily. On the whole, if you're willing to be friendly and interact, life will reward you with the little awesome things that can happen between players.\n\nAs for PvE, there's an autotargeting system (the green outline) that lets you lock on, which is especially helpful for hitting monsters that look like they're running all over the place - or sheep who won't stay still! Gathering food, leathers, straps, ore, etc. is all exciting for me in particular because I get to have my home base, but am encouraged to travel the continent for different items I need. This spurs interactions, sometimes some stiff situations I have to talk myself out of. Sometimes I meet a nice person building a campfire and I stop to chat. The mapping of resources keeps players circulating.\n\nThis game is in Alpha. The developers are doing their best to find a nice balance for players from both walks of life: PvE and PvP. They read the discussion boards and suggestions and try to implement/try new things to see if they can please the farmers, the grinders, the tree choppers, and the raiders.\n\nI don't suggest you play it if you're easily bothered by other players and their actions because things do happen. I highly suggest working with a friend, at least in the beginning while you're working to raise skills and such. I split the work with a friend and it made life WAY easier - as far as I could read from other peoples' comments and complaints.\n\n","May 31, 2015","true","91.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I started playing this game with some friends.  Our guild camp has been fortunate enough to survive so far but I can't say the same for our neighboring guilds.  We've seen atleast 8 different guilds that started playing around the same time we did and end up quitting as soon as they're base got griefed or destoryed by bully guilds (Mainly some guild called Ironborn).  The entire map is filled with abandoned camps.  Mostly noob camps that ended up quitting after getting griefed.  There are so many abandoned camps it is very difficult to find a large enough open spot to build camp.\n\nThis game is fun as long as you either play with a large group of friends or you can join a large established guild.  Otherwise, you're just sitting duck basically collecting mats for the big guilds to steal and/or destroy.  It's not a possibility, it's a guarantee.  This game seems to be filled with bullies who enjoy destroying peoples work, just to do it even though there is no benefit whatsoever.\n\nThe game has lots of serious flaws.  When I first started playing I caught several people stealing or killing my animals on my property.  When I attack that person, I'm the one who is awarded a criminal record.  Speaking of criminal records.  When I mentioned that there are no real consequences for griefing, bullying, stealing or destorying other peoples property, criminal records do not last long at all.  Criminal Record debuffs last between 30 seconds to a few hours depending on the severity of the crime.  I dont know why they called it Criminal Record because your crimes are not recorded.  After the debuff wears off, there are no records of any crimes you committed.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend this game.  This is a sandbox game but you are very limited on how or what you build due to available open space or having your buildings destroyed by bullies.  It doesn't hurt that the map is not very big and there are too many abandoned camps.  If you're thinking of purchasing this game, all you have to do is go on their Community Hub Discussions and you'll see what kind of people play this game.","June 6","false","76.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I am okay with this so far since I am not focusing too much on the graphics, but there are definitely lots of room for improvement, e.g. the low polygon modeling of structures, awkward animations etc.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nAs with all you would expect from a survival game, you punch trees, you make tools, and you build houses. The gameplay is solid, yet the complexity of the system makes it hard to grasp from the start. The skill point system reminds me of Ultima Online, which seems to be a popular trend in all the new multiplayer sandbox games (I am looking at you, Life is Feudal). You grind items to level up your skills, which unlocks more items you can grind to level up more skills.\n\nThe items you can craft are not shown until you reaches certain skill level, which is sometimes confusing when you are not leveling all skills and you don't know how to craft certain materials from the certain skill while leveling a different skill. This is where the multiplayer part come in - you can have different people leveling different skills and helping each other out.\n\nThe UI is clean and functional, though sometimes irresponsive. The control is classic WASD with F to pickup items on the ground. However, the game does not have a keybind remapping option nor does it shows which key does what, so you may need to try all the keys on your keyboard to see what they do.\n\nCOMMUNITY:\nI am playing on the Asia server. The community seems indifferent, most people do not respond. Trolls and thieves are common in game, but that is part of the gameplay. It is hard to survive on your own, so grab some buddies to accompany you on your journey and remember - lock everything you can. It is up to you to protect yourself.\n\n\nSince it is still early access, it is difficult to judge a game. I see potentials in this game, but whether or not it can grow into a mature multiplayer sandbox survival game depends on the developer's dedication. Nevertheless I am willing to support the game and hopefully it will turn out to be great at release.","May 30, 2015","true","13.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The game has a strong focus on casual, relaxed game play with music that reinforces that point.\n\nThe early game is without a tutorial at the time of writing, but the game is easy and simple to pick up for most basic skills. Resource distribution for most resources is ideal; however ores are too rare for the difficulty in levelling mining up. Resources change based on the zone you are in, making a list of where to locate resources is really important for later in the game when you are missing, for example, braided straps.\n\nThe mid game is where the game is still being fleshed out, with some mechanics still unknown to the wider community, such as ranching. Defending your settlement is impossible without walls, and the player should focus on skilling and logging out with everything they want when they have had enough for the time being, either players will destroy settlements or the night time mobs will erase most abandoned settlements in short order (a very nice mechanic for getting rid of abandoned buildings). This mechanic allows the map to feel not so settled.\n\nPvP in the game is a mixed bag, with the system in the early stages with no current claim system in place, the only way to protect your belongings is to group together so that there is constant activity in your town, or work on locks as quickly as possible and hope nobody thinks you are worth lockpicking.\n\nAll in all, for a freshly released game, it is enjoyable and engaging to play, combat can be intense and fun and updates that balance the game seem to be frequent, the developers react to elements of the game that may be too hard (a good example was iron ingots, which require 25 mining, were used in wooden gates, which put walls outside everyone’s capabilities to place, were nerfed to requiring just 10 sculptures)","May 30, 2015","true","127.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The positive benefits of this game are well advertised, so I'll focus on the negatives that stand out immidiately to me.\n\n1. Griefing\n\nIn it's current state, it is far too easy for people to loot all your goods you worked hard to get. Yes things can lock, but there seem to be traces of evil everywhere marking pillaged areas.\n\n2. Day/Night cycle\n\nDays seem way too short. Starting off in the game, I lose a lot of initial enjoyment because I barely have any daylight to go out and try to explore for items I need. I seem to spend a majority of my time trying to find food and then before I know it, it's dark again.  I guess I just need to choose to starve for awhile to get ahead in the game. Hopefully this is addressed later.\n\n3. Hunger decay rate\n\nHunger seems to drop way too fast. This mixed with the  Day/Night cycles starts to create a cycle in the start of the game of doing nothing but hunting for food and then hiding from deadly enemies all night. Please at least reduce hunger decay by 1/4th of the rate or something to provide some relief.\n\n\nAll in all though, it is still enjoyable though frustrating. I have faith though that it will pull through and address these issues since the game is very brand new.\n\n\nUPDATES:\n\n1. Griefing\n\nAfter spending more time in the game, I have some suggestions of how some of the key issues can be resolved. The biggest being that we as players need more ways to defend our land. Not to a ridiculous amount, but more than what is currently provided.\n\nFirst, perhaps adding a new building type for "Barracks" that could spawn NPC guards that would fight intruders. This helps to deter looting while we are away from the game.\n\nSecond, make it so that the arrow towers perhaps deal a little extra to players. It seems that well armoured players are barely affected even by the best arrows.\n\nThird is to nerf down lock picking. It is far too easy to lock pick in mine and others opinions. Perhaps make lockpicks only produce 5 instead of 10 at a time. Also, have different tiers of lockpicks for copper, iron, etc. Copper can pick the lower level locks, while iron is required for medium level locks, and mithril for the higher level locks.\n\n\n2. Day/Night cycle\n\nAfter spending more time in the game, the amount of time only seems very short when you are just starting and trying to learn to play the game. Would still like to see a small increase in the day time cycle, but it is fair enough as is.\n\n3. Hunger decay rate\n\nI still say that the hunger decays way too quickly. It is nearly a requirement to always have good meat on you to stay well fed. I would be happy if the decay rate would change by even 10-15% of it's current rate. That way it still goes somewhat fast, but not as fast as it is currently.\n\n4. Durability (Repair)\n\nThis is a new one that is somewhat frustrating, but not too much. I would like to see the ability to repair tools, weapons, armour, etc. On the lesser scale of things, it does not really matter too much when you are just using common items.

Carry your lost sheep back home to their stable, cure the sick cows and gather some fresh eggs from the chicken.\n\nThe game offers a wide array of fun crafts, such as tinkering and carpentry, creating streetlights, messageboards, fancy torches to go around the pretty dark and scary nights, to steal some of your neighbours freshly baked applepies with your tinkering tools.\n\nAhh, finally a game that is not all about fighting and war!\nThere is more to this one. A calming and relaxing atmosphere, to hang out around the campfire with your guildies, and go shopping in your self-created town!\n\nOf course there are also a bunch of weaponskills that can be mastered, to fight off some darker creatures of the night, together with your comrades. As well as scaenging some useful items from animals and goblins, ogres  and the lot.\n\nIt is still Early Access, so there is plenty of potential for the game makers to make something unique out of this. Something we haven't tasted before. Something beyond battling for territory like the thousand other strategy games. We can create a safehaven here, explore, trade with eachother, and experience life when it was still simpler: Gathering ingredients, crafting them and surviving from nature together.\nFrom this, we can evolve, creating towns, cities, yes, even Empires!\n\nAnd from this potential, we can maybe in the future even help NPC creatures build up their towns and cities too, solving their quests and aiding them as we discover the history of a unique, finally (almost)  non-violent world.\n\nCome and escape the real life warzone to build up something peaceful with us!\n\n\n\n","October 22, 2015","true","91.9"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","9","14","2","1"

I've played a lot of survival ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes like this, and a lot of them turn out to be unfinished abandoned garbage, but some do turn out great.\n\nKeep in mind this game is in Early Access so this review may not be accurate at a later point in time, and they may have fixed more of it by then.\n\n\nPROS:\n\n-Fun to play with friends or just make friends online and play with them.\n-TONS of skills to level up, and you can combine them any way you want.  You want to be a master of Unarmed Combat whilst also being a Fisherman that's buff as ♥♥♥♥ from Logging?  Do ittttt.\n-Tons of time can be put into this game, if you're really looking to go ham in the play-time.\n-Lots of items and gear and loot to find/upgrade.\n-The devs are really good about fixing bugs within the first couple days of people reporting them, as far as I've seen.\n\nCONS:\n\n-The biggest con for me is this:  The devs announced EVERYWHERE that they were making the map 4x+ bigger than it previously was (I had not played the game previous to this 4x update), however what they actually did was make it 4x bigger and block off 3/4 the new map with impenetrable fog, so you can't go to those areas anymore.  They claim it's for development purposes, but that seems kind of 'swindly' to me.  Don't promise one thing and then give another.\n-Combat is boring.  Point and Click pretty much.\n-If you don't have friends to play with, or aren't willing to play with people in the game, you probably won't progress very far unless you spend hours and hours grinding materials.\n-Lots of bugs, duh.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nIt's really not a bad game, it just needs a lot of work done on it.  I've enjoyed it so far, made some friends, dumped 30+ hours into something I only spent $13.99 on, so I consider it worth it.  Do I recommend it?  Only if you're willing to wait for more content to be released and if you're a somewhat social gamer.  IMO this game would be real hard to play solo and make any real progress.\n\nRating: 7/10 (mostly for broken promises)","April 26","true","43.9"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","0"

And also after I had already given the game a negative review.\n\nThis is a wordy review, but this game deserves every word here, and more...\n\nVery fun and challenging game, the development team has great ideas for the future, no other games that I've experienced has so many survival, city-building, crafting, PVE and PVP balance like this game does.\n\nDo not let the acronym: PVP scare some of you away, there is a criminal system in the game that creates an environment that proves to be very costly to players who will harass, assault, wound, kill or damage the property of other players.\n...And likewise, do not let the words "criminal system" scare some of you PVP'ers away either. The criminal sytem is implemented well, very well.\nI myself play with a rather large criminal penalty looming over my head once or twice every week. and have only found it slightly inconvient one time so far.\nBut, I do not go about grieving other players either. Grieving other players is why the crinminal system was implemented into the game to begin with.\nIf you want to play a bad guy or a sneak in  this game, then be prepared to spend a lot of time 'safely' hiddem from other players while your criminal penalty times out.\n\nI am not just blowing hot air here now: There really is not enough space in this review to expound on all of the brilliant features that are all integrated together to make this an extremely fun and even exciting game to play.\nThe quality and range of end-goal and play-style pursuits that players have in this game seems endless already, not to mention the new content added frequently in upates.\nAnd the sneak peeks given to us so far on future updates and plans well, you can almost see how they are going to fit so well into the game once you have played and explored the game for a day or two.\nBut, even with out those updates and with out the future update plans revealed already, the game still stands alone as an extremely fun an quite challenging survival game.\n(Very different type of survival game, very very different)\n\nThe building aspect of this game is very similar to the "age of empires series"\nBut: in this game, your character actually plays with his or her feet on the ground among the shops, farms, walls, towers and the  large variety of other crafting and storage building that can be built.\n\nThe skills in the skill tree are quite numerous even with the skill system not fully fleshed out yet (about 90% implemented) although the game play doesn't miss those skills that have not been totally implemented into the skill tree yet.\nAlso, the numerous skills are all integrated with each other too, and the same goes for the materials gathered that are needed to craft with, many of those materials have uses in multiple different skills.\nVery well thought out !\n\nAgain, it is an awesome game but:\nIt is not for casual gamers who want to play solo, if you plan on playing solo be prepared to spend a lot of very vigilant time in the game just to keep your head above water in this game.\nTo progress even at a moderate pace as a solo player, it requires a lot of time spent gathering, crafting and repairing.  Not to mention the time spent in defensive vigilence over your base too.\nI practrically played solo my first few months, but I have a lot of time to play. (I am in a guild now)\nIf you still want to play as a casual player,  then I suggest you might want to join or form a guild in your first week of game play.(Otherwise this game will eat you alive).\n\nThe player-base on all three servers is slowly recovering in numbers. They have also just installed: VAC (anti-cheating engine) on those servers too.\nI play on both the American server and on the Asian server (There is also a European server)... On both of the servers that I play on, the community of players are friendly to helpful with a few rare exceptions.\nThere is also a fair sized group of very experienced and strong players and guilds still faithfuly playing that can and do help or guide new players along, and or even protect a new player if needed.","August 4, 2015","true","348.8"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","13","22","0","0"

It still needs a ton of work.\n\n-The combat system is totally stupid. I became a criminal for attacking someone who was stealing from my house. Then his friends showed up and killed me, all the while they stayed "good" and I was the criminal and lost everything. And my auto-defense towers didn't even shoot.\n\n-The targeting is a joke and completely not scalable for an MMO with large number of combatants.\n\n-Defenses are absolutely worthless; you can punch down a wall within 3 minutes by yourself and without a weapon. Stone walls take about 10 minutes. Yet take a very very long time to build.\n\n-There is no way to lock in your mounts or animals in a stable or barn so they are easily and constantly killed or stolen.\n\n-Hunger - You will always be hungry. The bar drops so fast you can only forge for food most of the time. Its the worst part of this game.\n\n-Day/Night Cycle - Days are much too short and the nights are much too long. And Zombies will come and destroy everything to made since they auto attack everything. I just love waking up in the morning to find my entire village destroyed by NPCs.\n\nOn the plus side, the map is huge and concept is great, but overall a terrible game.","May 31, 2015","false","14.9"," 30 of 55 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","30","55","0","0"

So far from the 3 hours ive been playing, most of all people i've encountered are friendly and informative. It seems that teamwork in this game is valued despite only meeting up strangers and bonding. There may be some PK's, but the game punishes those who kill but having them a criminal status, and drops all their loot when they die.

The artwork and the original game play looked like it was a little too much to be true for such a beta game. I have been through a few that are just not worth the money.\n\nThat being said, I bought the game May 28 and already logged over 10 hours into the game.\n\nLet's start with the bad even though there is very little currently.\n- 1 - Low Content\nRight now the game has a lot of content to muddle through, however it seems like so much more is planned for this game and I can not wait to see what they reveal in the coming years.\n\n- 2 - Minor Bugs\nEven though this is in all Beta games. It still is to be expected that some bugs exist however, all that the group and I found were map issues and maybe the typical lag here and there but these are quickly being taken care of by the Dev team.\n\n- 3 - Kill o Sight\nWe all know it, but for those that do not. Starting areas are already seemingly camped by people who wish to bring nothing but a discontenting game play. Open Player Killing is a very real thing is this game though get yourself in a group of friends and you might just find yourself taking it to these "Criminals" of the game. There is a deterrent to this playstyle however, that if a player does kill another, they are tagged at "Criminals" and instead of a random item dropping from the inventory, the entire bag drops including equips. However, this does create others wanting to provoke an innocent to attack so that they can kill them.\n\n- 4 - More If/When they Come\n\nNow for a brick listing for the game of its Pros.\n- 1 - Enriched Environment\nTree of Life hits you right off the bat with stunning Environmental beauty as you end up as a Shipwrecked individual on one several parts of this world. The sunsets and sunrises are nothing to scoff at. So far the only weather we have seen are clear and sunny skies though I am sure weather such as rain or cloudy will eventually come into play.\nThe landscape is very enriched with Forests, Deserts, Badlands, Plains, and Tundras. The game even varies in MULTIPLE altitudes throughout the lands. Even the Tree of life itself is in the map for you to view in awe of. Be warned though, the land is not with out its dangers.\n\n- 2 - Growing World\nTree of Life is a sandbox world that grows as the players do. Feel like wanting to build a Fort? Well the wilds will take notice and Challenge you. Want to live as a nomad? Grind skills and walk the world selling wears. Live a life you want in the way you want, though every change you make effects the world in which we all live in.\n\n- 3 - Indepth Skilling System\nTree of Life has a Skill system in which the more you use the better you get with that skill, however you are limited to the number of skill points. However, don't let this think you will make a mistake in leveling a skill. If you find you want to specialize later you can tell the system to pull points from other skills to max the ones you want. You can even lock skills so they do not grow at all when you use them.\n\n- 4 - Community Driven\nThis follows my previous point. Because you are only given so much to Specialize in, you will end up having to rely on others to fill in the gaps, which will see many strangers making deals to help one another out. Though, beware, you never know what another player's intentions are except for the Red named "Criminals".\n\n- 5 - Sandbox\nThis is a Cry to the world to let them know that the game's title does not lie. Build everywhere, very very limited were you can NOT build. Build massive forts, or build a small town. Live the life of a nomad, or as a Soldier defending the weak. Be and build what your heart desires. With so much planned how could you go wrong.\n\n\nNow keep in mind this is an Early Access review but so much is good about this game already. Worth the 20$ and even some just for the extra unlocks. These by the way are in no way game breaking. Stop on by and join us in this wonderful world of "Tree of Life".","May 29, 2015","true","134.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I've read some reviews where they state that its grindy.  I don't know if its because I've played Life is Feudal (so much grind, it makes you want to melt your face off), but this isn't grindy at all (to me). You build stuff. You jack cows and chickens from the wild. You get beat up by stupidly strong skeletons/trolls/plants (yes plants)/wolves/other things. You beat said things up. You (can) beat up other players. You (can) cooperate with other players. One thing it lacks is the ability to actually party up. So if you go exploring with your pals, you can lose each other pretty easily and not have any map indicator to find them. However, there is a large, detailed map which helps negate that problem to a degree. Plenty of things can be added but it has so much potential! Will be playing this often.

It is already very playable, especially for an early access game.\nMy impression of it is that it's a combination of Ultima Online, Minecraft and Harvest Moon.\nThe skill system is very much like Ultima Online, you can work up several skills, but only have so many points allowed, so you have to be a bit choosy on what you want to really have.\nThe karma system of getting flagged with more and more negative karma is very much like the earlier days of Ultima online. Yes, people can take advantage of being positive karma and grief others in ways that don't cause them negative karma, and  you will earn negative karma if you choose to take action against them in the form of killing the griefer. Frustrating, but not the end of the world in my own opinion.\nThe gui setup feels very similar to minecraft, along with the sandbox, "find your own thing to do" feeling and the more agressive local monsters spawning at night. The crafting is at least similar enough to minecraft style crafting, but with the ease of recipes showing what you need instead of having to look it up online or remember.\nThe cutesy-ness is so harvest moon, along with the cows and pigs etc... being able to feed them and get milk and things from them. Then you can apparently give them potions to produce baby animals. The farming is pretty easy to do with reasonable time waiting for crops.\nFinally, so far for myself and husband who are playing, the social aspect is pretty interesting. it does remind me of the days when I played UO because there is no whispering or sending tells to people afar. You can hear people within normal hearing range of your character. Word bubbles appear above people's heads but there is also a chat log for some ease of looking back. We met with some other new players and are forming a sizable guild village, people are working together and that has been soooo cool. It does feel like the amount of work involved in building up a safe fortress, you couldn't really pull that off alone. I don't always like social games, but this one has just really pulled me in. It's almost my perfect dream game.","July 7, 2015","true","286.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","3"

I.E. cutting wood to level up logging. This can lead to tedious grinding in some areas if you are working alone to progress a base.\n\nThe map is huge (literally took me an hour to cover 1/10th of the map going south) however it feels very cluttered. Its hard not to run into someone that has set up a small camp that is rotting away unused.\n\nThe graphics are a bit dated but it feels right in this environment leading to a relaxed setting and pleasing to the eyes.\n\nTLDR run down.\n\nWorth it if you like an easy flowing Crafting game based on MMO "skill" progression.\n","April 22","true","45.9"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

You start with nothing, already missing some hp, and every single enemy in the game can completely ♥♥♥♥ you. The first, and only weapon you are allowed to build at first, is incapable of even coming close to killing something, and the only way to get strong enough to kill something is to kill something. Logic.\n\nOn top of that, while you are desperately floundering around trying to figure out how the ♥♥♥♥ to progress with crafting, every single time you die, you become a ghost for 3 minutes, incapable of talking, interacting, (the first thing you type comes out fine, which is good for scaring the ♥♥♥♥ out of people because they can't see your ghost body, but then the rest is all "..." automatically [Same when you are dead]) or doing anything else. The only way to shorten the respawn time from 3 minutes is to collect soul crystals while you are dead, but the stupid crystals are spread out so far from eachother that it could literally be the entire 3 minutes before you find one and they only shorten the timer by 30 seconds when you do.\n\nNow lets talk about how my "Journey" started.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n- I spawn\n- Pitched black outside ( and I mean black, darker than dead night in ARK: Survival Evolved)\n- Wonder around for a second\n- Get cracked by a red name\n- Yell at monitor\n- 3 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes of being a ghost\n- Scared the ♥♥♥♥ out of someone by saying something while I'm a ghost (just once as mentioned earlier)\n- I spawn again\n- Start chopping a tree\n- A yellow name comes up to me and starts hitting me\n- I start hitting him back\n- He suddenly stops hitting me (name still yellow some ♥♥♥♥ing how)\n- I hit him again and suddenly I turn red\n- He kills me, I lose the few things in my inventory\n- 3 more minutes of being a ghost\n- I spawn again\n- Chop a tree with my fists\n- Craft a club\n- Try to attack monster with club thinking I had a chance now that I have a weapon\n- Nope. (Not even close)\n- 3 more minutes of being a ghost\n- I spawn again\n- Realization that I can't kill anything\n- Farm materials\n- Get stuck on crafting because I can't kill anything\n- Day turns to night\n- Can't see ♥♥♥♥\n- Get rekt by something I can't see\n- 3 more minutes of being a ♥♥♥♥ing god damn ghost\n- I spawn again\n- Finally manage to make the strongest weapon available to me\n- Attempt to fight a "Annoying Tree Demon" (what seemed like the enemy with the least hp)\n- Get ♥♥♥♥ing rekt again in 3 hits.\n- Alt + F4\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI didn't experience these unfortunate events because of some bad luck or because I'm an incompetent gamer.\nI experienced these unfortunate events because that is what the game throws you into. There are no controls listed within the game so be prepared to use google. The only "Tutorials" are guides written by the steam community which still aren't tutorials but instead tips on how to progress. None of which show the controls. It was 50 minutes before I knew that WW was dash.\n\nI don't know anything about the refund policies here on Steam, but I'm about to go find out.

If you like PVP and overall annoy other people this is the game for you. They say it's PVE focussed well it's absolutely not. Yes at first you have to try and survive the nights but once you start building a camp random people just come along and either bash your stuff or just steal everything that can't be locked (if it's locked they will become criminals. If you kill a criminal all his loot will drop).\n\nHowever there is no way for you to stop non criminal players from running into your camp and just build stuff in your camp or steal your animals and crops...\n\nI wonder if they are capable of changing that.\n\nIn other words if you like open worlds and bashing people this is the game for you.

This game is a lot of fun and played very well without anything major bugging out or ruining the experience.  Other players walked by and continued on their merry way, so I was able to have solid game time without interupptions.  Quite a few players online which was great, although they didn't chat much.  Crafting and building is very easy to get used to and it doesn't take much to get things going.  You feel as though you've accomplished something when you start seeing your little village or town coming to life.  Walking around I have seen quite a few villages and towns set up which was really neat.\n\nIf I could give any advice to the developers it would be to have some sort of "help" or "how-to" in game so we don't have to web browse while playing the game.  Something to at least show the basics, or where to start.  As of right now, you are kind of thrown in with little know how, but you will easily find your way.  This is especially true if you are familiar with survival games in general, food, weapons and crafting will come easily and the gardening system is just genius.

I enjoy the concept of the game, the general helpfulness of the community in game. Yes, that's right not much kill on sight happening in a survival game. Sadly, I would absolutely not recommend buying this game at this point in time. Trust me in about a year this game will be something to look at.\n\nCONS\n- Enemy Spawning in camp.- That's right, after you've invested many hours gathering resources and building walls miracle zombies will spawn directly inside your camp and sit there destroying it (even while you are offline). This leads to mostly the first 2-3 hours upon logging in, rebuilding the destruction, further decreasing your ability to progress.\n\n-Theiving with no criminal status- Currently in game you can hop a wall (or easily enter through a broken destroyed by a zombie) of a great empire and proceed to plunder their farms, kill their cattle, steel their vegetables, carts, mounts. All without any affect from the criminal system. I'm sure this will be addressed at a later date, but for now, it's unbearable.\n\n-Kind of a walking simulator too grindy- While this is typical of survival games, this one seems to go to great lengths with forced marching to acquire resources. Walking 45 minutes in hopes to find a vein of iron so you can build a beginner building is currently not acceptable. This will be great when (imagining) trade routes are setup between major cities with players carrying goods between one point or another for profit. Now, it's simply not like that and spending an afternoon traveling to the center of the map just isn't fun.\n\n-Targeting - This one needs some major work. It's soft targeting which is fine, but getting that soft target to work is another story, simply, 50% functional at this time.\n\n\nPROS\n+Great Community + Be good or bad this community has a can and will do attitude. I expect to see many undertakings setup by the community at large. Such as: trade routes, bounty hunters, trade locations -- think Eve Online.\n\n+Fun + It's does give you a sense of enjoyment when you're working with others and solo to extend your existence. Just discovering the towns built across the countryside by players is quite entertaining.\n\n+environments + I definitely enjoyed the difference in environments and how certain environments only spawn certain resources. This goes slightly against my negative comment, but it's a great idea, just bad that they excuted to require those "Far away" resources on early buildings.\n\n+Leveling system + Leveling system I really enjoyed as well, what you do levels that skill. So if I'm farming I will level farming ect.\n\nThere are a ton more items I could touch on both negative and good, but I will digress.","June 3, 2015","false","12.3"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","0"

First off, this is a great sandbox experience when it comes to an MMO, in fact it's the best I've played since ultima online ( back in the day ). Don't like grinding out 2000 quests? No problem... Don't want to only be able to use 1 or 2 of the proffesions in game? Use them all! Wish those warrior skills you trained could be a different skill set now? Again not a problem. Want a fortress for you and your friends/guildies to call home? Build away!\n\nPros\nA real SANDBOX MMO ( Ultima Online style, but better? )\nPlayer territory ( You claim where you build, but feel free to move because the world is yours to claim )\nNot another WoW clone... ( Thank you [insert spiritual being here] )\nEven with limited character customization you feel unique with Equipment\n1000s of hours worth of good times here\nFirst game in years I've started friendships with people I met in game\nI believe this will be the first MMO since vanilla WoW to build a true community of players\nMost importantly however the game is a ton of fun (friends recommended, but not required)\n\nCons\nNo friends list/chat\nNo Guild Chat\nNot a lot to say here since it's still pretty much brand new (can't bash early access games for not being polished)\nEvery human being hasn't tried it yet\n\nWill try to keep this review up-to-date as much as possible ( no promises )\n\nMy experience thus far...\nStarted it up, got dumped on the edge of the map with no direction.\nWondered around exploring for a couple hours\nFound a friendly stranger and started building a settlement with him\nMore friendly strangers joined\nGot harrassed by a Red Player (criminal) a few times before he went away\nKept building up our new settlement\nRed player comes back and starts smashing our stuff while I'm the only one online (had no walls or defenses yet)\nI got frustrated and just picked up what I could and left\nHeaded far away from that area\nStarted a new settlement, met a new friend\nHung out awhile, all was well, all was quiet\nDecided that area was to well and to quiet\nSo I moved again, but this time by choice\nFound a guy in a prime location with a settlement started, but the walls were in ruins\nJoined his guild\nRebuilt all the walls and arrow towers\nLived happily ever after\nGot robbed\nRevved up security\nLive happily ever after... for now\n\n\nAt the end of the day greatest gaming experience I've had in a long time\nPrior to finding this I was ready to give up on gaming due to the fact that no good games have been released in at least a decade... 1997+ UO was king, 1999 EQ Came up as UO's only true competition, 2000 Diablo II the greatest game in the world came out(not a mmo per se but get over it) 2004 WoW came in to change the face of MMOs forever (at the time it was great) 2005-2015 WoW became progressively more and more designed for a 5 year old to play it.... also in 2005-2015 every MMO ever tried to copy WoW exactly...\n\nSo yeah this game is a breath of fresh air, and I would recommend it to the world.","June 26, 2015","true","515.5"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","16","29","3","0"

This one is AMAZING. It's not complete so there bugs and areas that need improvement but I find the pacing to be pretty good.\nOf course there are few things I'd like them to add such as friends showing up on minimap, home location on minimap, sharing cabins with friends and some way to share info. It may be possible to create books to leave notes for others to read but I haven't gotten that far.\nIf I had to be pressed I'd say it'd be closest to if Ultimate Online, Minecraft and Don't Starve had a baby pc game. There's survival elements, limited number of skill points that you can choose to level up or not and you can build cabins, forts, fences, etc. You can't mine the land so no changing of mountains but that may be a good thing.\nFor $20 it's cheap entertainment and the lat bit of advice I'd give is to spring for the next  level and pay $25 that way you'll save yourself the $2-$3 extra if you add on the DLC version after you realize you need more backpack space.

After you pick your region it's time for you to create a character, in the character customization you pick a skin color, hair color and you pick a boat.\n\nThe boat you pick is based on where you are going to spawn in the world. For example the bottom left boat (looking like a viking boat) that's the one I picked and I spawned in the bottom left. From there on out I met up with my friends on the beach and we went to trees and started chopping some trees, got some twigs and some logs. Then I pressed "E" and looked at the crafting of the game.\n\nAfter that I knew the game was awesome, since you have to craft some kind of workbench and from there you can craft other structures that let you craft more and more. In order to craft the things you need a certain skill though.\n\nYour skill points go up by using a skill more and more. For example if you want to level Tinkering you have to keep making things from Tinkering.\n\nNow another thing is you get stats for doing these things, for example for Tinkering I got a lot of "Con" which is Max HP increase. Now for using my axe a lot I got a lot of strength.\n\nNow about the "Karma system" if you steal something you become red. This is for I believe 30 minutes. Now if you would murder someone you become red for 60 minutes.\n\nThe consequences of being red is that if you die you lose everything you have on you and some Experience points as well, however I didn't notice that yet.\n\nAll in all I'd say the game is a blast where I only found 1 bug and that is some invisible mob that attacked me when I was on a mount. It only happened once though.\n\nThis game has a really bright future and I look forward to some good updates.","May 29, 2015","true","47.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The developers do not communitcate with there player/fan base in an efficient  and coherant manner making updates/patches very difficult to understand.  and sometimes impossible.\n\nIf you are interested in this game save you money until it goes to full release. as for now all you will be doing is thowing good money after bad.\n\nThey have just introduced mounts that you can buy from the store that actually cost more than the game itself. They have mounts within the game but they have nobbled them so that they are difficult to make and they only last for 8 rides. and with the amount of game crashes that have been exprienced since the introduction of Beta, they are not worth the resources requirid to attempt to make the saddle to make a mount.\n\nSo buy the game at your own risk.\n\nplease feel free to add me as a friend and i can go into more detail if more is required.","August 21, 2015","false","132.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Very fun as an idea but falls short and I was very hopeful until just now when i read the recent patch notes which didn't address a single one of the following issues.\n\n-The resource gathering is not engaging. No skills or even progression in resource gathering... Skilling up merely allows you to process the next item tier. Everything requires about 10 minutes of farming wood ( bassically clicking trees ) before you can craft with them. Processing these items into something usable takes another 10 minutes... WITH NO QUEUING. This means if you have to make 50 stone bricks or 50 iron Ore or whatever... you have to sit there and click the icon every 15 seconds. Autoclickers help but why do we have to bother with setting any of that up??\n\n-Combat is not engaging. You bassically face your target and click... no skills... no progression. On top of that you have to deal with the terrible lag which means most attacks will not even register because of server desync, and you will have to do all your fighting while standing still.\n\n-Nothing is worth killing... nothing... Bears were for a little while when you need oil and HQ oil... but other than that, nope. Most mobs drop coins which is the currency that is used mainly to repair buildings and you only need to kill about 10-20 things to get enough to repair your base fully. There are however, about 5 items that requires you to farm a specific mob that will require you about 1hour to just get to, kinda cool but bleh that time sink! OH let me say it again... there is no reason to pve in this game. The only pve available is an event that spawns a bunch of mobs to attack your base. Its novel and can be fun but the only reward is bassically resources to build a bigger base to fight against bigger attacks... This is not content, there is no strategy or skill involved in any of it... bassically build more walls and turrets win game!\n\n-Coins(the intended currency) are worth very little. you can buy items from player made shops but since coins are so useless, most shops are not replenished and in the event someone is selling something you want, you have to travel to said shops to buy. Sooooooo.... if you actually do find something you want, this translates to about 30minutes to an hour to run there just to buy it.\n\n-If nobody in your guild logs on, your base will slowly decay. Meaning you have about a week before someone will have easy enough access to pillage literally everything no matter how big your base is. This doesnt mean you simply have to log on but you literally have to be near the base to stop this despawning. Multiple bases or outposts are never ever worth it. Destroyed buildings also only have 24 hours to be repaired before vanishing. So don't ever go on vacation or anything or you lose stuff!\n\n-pvp is bassically impossible because of dsync. Its still kind of fun to clash sometimes, but unfortunately, however good your gear is, it will bassically come down to who has more bandages and ginseng - meaning if someone is prepared to fight you and you are farming... you will always lose. Plus numbers matter... a lot... a lot lot and it doesnt make sense to farm together because resources are spread out, so you will get ganked, and you will probably have no chance\n\nSo besides all that, it can be a fun game still, I cleared a lot of hours, albeit a lot of those hours are spent logged in afk waiting for criminal rating to go down. There is great potential here, and if you read all that and still want to give it a try, go for it! If you have a small group it can be lots of fun for a bit but you wont find players to group with in game, and you wont find any end game. You might still get your 20 bucks worth out of it, but I feel you should know these things because there was an update from the devs about long term goals that did not adress a single one of these issues so dont say you werent warned. Gooduck!!\n\nps. I see a lot of complaints about theives but honestly this is not a huge problem and i'd like to give my 2 cents. If you are smart you will learn how to make yourself a difficult target for them (DO NOT BUILD GATES UNTIL YOU LITERALLY HAVE THE BEST LOCKS, instead just build walls and ladders ). The system does favor theiving, but danger is the only thing that makes this game fun! Safety lies in numbers... do not solo... make sure someone checks your base daily! Use your resources before logging off or log off with rares and you will not experience crippling losses.\n\npss. They are planning on releasing the game in 6-9 months so expect another wipe then.\n\nBYE","June 3","false","347.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sorenthaz/recommended/361800/","Sorenthaz","Sorenthaz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sorenthaz/","162 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is pretty dang awesome for anyone looking for a softer Sandbox title that doesn't revolve around PvP.  PvP is a factor, but it rewards killing player-killers more than anything, since dying as a green-name only drops one random item as opposed to dying as a red-name which empties your whole inventory and is a persistent consequence that lasts for a full hour no matter how many times you die during it.   Also killing red-names keeps your name green instead of turning it red for killing someone, so you can basically kill griefers and loot all their ♥♥♥♥ to punish them.\n\nSkills are pretty varied, but the cool thing is that you gain stats per each skill level, and you only have so many points to level skills with, and each skill raises a certain stat every 1 and 4 levels (i.e. Farming raises Con every 1 level and Str every 4 levels - 20 Farming will give you +20 Constitution and +5 Strength). As a result, you can choose stuff to specialize in or be a jack of all trades if you wish to.   The skills range from crafting to combat to stuff like music and mining and farming.   No matter what you skill up though, you're benefiting it via stats.  So even if you're a hardcore Farmer and lack combat prowess, you'll still be able to take a ton of hits and still hurt enemies a good amount.\n\nExploration is a huge factor to the game as well, as you won't be able to find everything in one single area.  As the game adds more to find and do, exploration will be even more beneficial.   So while settling down is very smart to do (especially with other players since many hands will make the work much easier), exploring is still quite important as you can bring stuff non-native to your area and cultivate it.   For example, reindeers in the frozen regions can theoretically be bred in other areas as long as you grab a male and female one.   Crops like Lettuce, Corn, and various tree types also are scattered in different regions, so it's highly beneficial to bring some seeds or carry saplings over.\n\nThe coolest thing is that everything's persistent.  While some stuff does randomly respawn or regenerate in areas, you really do need to think before you recklessly cut/punch down an entire forest.\n\nSurvival is the name of the game here, but you're surviving more against the crazy nighttime environment more than other players.  It gives you a reason to team up with others and form pockets of civilization throughout the land.  Settlements can become cities, cities can become kingdoms, kingdoms can become empires... the potential is ridiculous.  As long as Odd One Games sticks to supporting and improving and adding to the game, I see nothing but good things to come out of Tree of Life.   If you liked stuff like ArcheAge or Rust but were turned off by the PvP-centric gameplay and wished for something more focused on cooperation and exploration in a hostile land that you need to band together to fight against, Tree of Life may be right up your alley.\n\nI didn't even know anything about this game 12 hours ago.  But it left me presently surprised and I'm so stoked to see what Odd One Games has for the future, as long as they don't screw things up majorly.\n\nAnd yes, there are bugs to be expected in Early Access.  Some people have issues more severely and frequently than others, but overall I've had a very positive first day in Tree of Savior and I strongly reccommend this game if you're looking to get lost in a true virtual world.","May 28, 2015","true","66.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

I killed him. In cold blood i killed my only friend. My name turned red i had become a criminal!\n\nThis game has an amazing community - if you aren't a criminal, i learnt this the hard way. People looked at me differently, no-one wanted to share their logs with me or even let me eat from the same apple tree. I decided i would get them back all the kids that used to look down at me, it was my time to become a legend.\n\nI saw a kid chopping down a tree. I killed him. maybe that will teach them to belittle me for being a criminal, criminals have feelings too.\n\nLittle did i know he was in a guild. They quickly sounded the alarms and there was a guild bounty on my head i had become an outcast! Not wanting to die i fled to the ocean and made my way towards the desolate desert where i quickly learnt i was not the only criminal in this world, oh no i was not alone. I created a band of criminal minds and we built an anti peace headquarters in the harshest terrain. This was our home, no-one would judge us here.\n\nThat was untill the ..... Nation attacked. We didn't stand a chance we were chased by men riding bulls and we fled our humble abode. we had no home but we had each other, and home is where the heart is.\n\nFast forward 2 hours we came across a nice plot of land in a quiet area and decided to stay clear of our criminal past times whilst we gained strength. The strength needed to win. we may have been outcast but we will come back stronger and wage war/\n\nTL/DR: Don't kill people straight away, you will be killed.\n\nThis game is really fun. i've missed the days where i would buy a game on rust and 2 weeks later realise that i had forgotten to eat shower and drink, this is one of those games.

I have not regretted it in the least. There have been many bugs yes but nothing too horrible as to call it game breaking unless you give up easy or are easilly frustrated.\n\nFirst off I do agree that the prices on the backpack and mount could be lowered just a little, but at the same time you have to understand and or play the game a while(of have done many early access games) to understand that while the in game items purchased may cost more than the game or even 3 times over(if you get it all) what you are doing is support the devs. If you had a awesome gaming store in your town open up that had exactly what you wanted, would you not support them by buying from them instead of another store? Same concept.\n\nI do like the systems they have in place. They definitly need a good bit of honing, like the placements of some of the crafting tiers(tinkering gets black powder fairly early but area to harvest sulfur is a "misty area" so it is very difficult to find safely, more so if you are alone. I saw that with this "Current" update to be applied that the pins will finally be enabled for the map. THANK YOU! That is a very nice thing to have in any mmo, expecially sandbox survival.\n\nI love the wandering ghost salesman. You can search in his menu and find items from players shops. to me this is a great addition to ANY MMO out there as player vendors have always been kinda sketchy in almost any game but this one, even this early access, seems well thought out.\n\nThere are a great number of things that they seem to have thought out very deeply and put into this game. The building of your base is fantastic. They do need to add in the ability to demolish something you yourself built to get back some of the basic materials(to help keep the servers clean and great when moving your base).\n\nThe guild system still is very basic but the "locks" are neat so only your guild members can open whatever you lock.\n\nOne thing I REALLY have to thank the Dev's for.....the lockpicking. While I myself am not a griefer/thief/pvper......their Lockpicking system is fantastic. If someone picks a lock successfully they can ether get in a gate, or loot a random box of treasure from your stores. The loot cannot be opened for a while and they cannot re-loot the same building for a while. they cannot just pop the lock and loot you dry. This is exceptionally good as that would kill the game for many people and draw a far darker crowd to the game. I have Rust and that is the main issue I have with it, Build a base, lock it up, stock up, come back next day, all gone. Poof. Heck day 1 was dying 100 times to try and build a base.\n\nNot on this game. Death is a minor loss. You will drop a random item and be a ghost for 1 minute 30 seconds. Unless you collect soul shards, which grant 30 secs less to the revive cool down.\n\nPvP isn't to harsh of a thing right now, mainly because if you have a proper base, anyone whom attacks you, anything you have created, any towers you have in the area will start to fire on anyone marked a criminal within their range. Not just your towers though but any tower at all if they have been naughty.\n\nBlue named players are generally good, Yellow means they just accidentally or purposly did something naughty, red meand they have been VERY naughty. Red named folks even appear on the map for eveyone to see. They have a bounty system as well but still needs to be improved a bit as coin doesn't have too much use save repairing destroyed buildings or changing your guild icon/color/pattern.\n\nI have traveled though much of the map, even through the misty areas to get a glimps of what is to come and I have to say I greatly look forward to it.\n\nI have played a great many early access games, mostly in the sandbox catagory. Of all of them, while unrefined, this one has what I could say, the best balance of most of them out there.\n\nBefore jumping into buying please to check out videos and reviews and decide for yourself, as you should for any game.\nIf you like creative, sandbox, open world(save misty areas), friendly and competitive gameplay, and of course the desire to explore, build, protect, and survive, then I would say give this game a try. I did and have regretted it since.....because it is the only game I have been playing since!

Something which can be totally destroyed by trolls and griefers in the manner of minutes.\n\nYou do not become "better" as you gain mastery, you simply have to gather even more resources until you start to realize that there isnt much content in the game, if any at all. The only thing that is left is the player interactions and community... which isn't very big at the moment - if they aren't taunting one another with childish terms as they swing their epeens around.. which engaging in griefting and troll tactics built around the game's flawed mechanics and defensive systems which are so easily cheesed thru..\n\nImo, the game in its current form is a cash grab.

The major differences I would say is that TOL is a bit more casual and in TOL you can kind of play more of a different role when it comes to how you want to play the game. In ARK you basically have to build and craft in TOL you can just go old school MMORPG and go kill mobs get drops heal yourself and keep killing mobs for equipment. Thats good because it is a faster way to play if your are by yourself. One thing this game definently needs is for bronze coins to be able to repair weapons, I know you can smelt weapons down for ingots but it would be better if you could just stick with one weapon and save inventory space. Also the dead sailor thing replacing a tin ore drop is well unique but a little odd. Overall this game kind of reminds me of Ragnarok Online a little bit because of the uniqueness and weirdness of drops, kill an dead sailor corpse and get tin! Funny.\n\nIt is a fun game so far that I have played, there are some combat issue or rather targetting issues but perhaps I havnt figured out how to target correctly? So far I have only come across like 3 keybuttons, E for inventory and char stats, M for map and Z to sit so hopefully they add a lot more. The other thing that is kind of annoying is how limited stacks of items can kind of be but I guess later on with wagons etc it becomes a lot easier. Also it seems like there are alot of abandoned stuff around and guild castles/cities that are inaccessible. With only 3 servers you would think the world would be densely populated but I only saw 1 person.\n\n\nSo far this game is an 8/10 to me. I look forward to more people playing and the devs introducing new stuff. I actually like this more than ARK and a lot of other survival games and I think that is because it is more casual.","September 22, 2015","true","7.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

On average I see one person every other hour or so? Maybe less honestly. I heard that it was quite large and filled with griefing before the crime update but I didn't get my hands on it until after that patch.\n\nIt's very grindy as well. So if you're into grinding (I somewhat am, gives me a goal I guess or I'm just a glutton for punishment) then you will like the skill and leveling style this game provides. One thing that would have deterred me that I didn't fully understand until I started playing and got further in, Mastery points. You have a certain amount of mastery points and once those are all used you can no longer gain levels in skills. It's a bit annoying for a completionist type like myself. I suppose it has its merrits in forcing you to work together to craft and build the good stuff but if you like being self reliant, it hurts.\n\nAll in all, its not a terrible play but it's not a great one either. It kept my attention for probably about 3 - 4 weeks or so. They do release updates frequently from what I've experienced and what I've read which is always a good sign with EA games.

So far I have only come across like 3 keybuttons, E for inventory and char stats, M for map and Z to sit so hopefully they add a lot more. The other thing that is kind of annoying is how limited stacks of items can kind of be but I guess later on with wagons etc it becomes a lot easier. Also it seems like there are alot of abandoned stuff around and guild castles/cities that are inaccessible. With only 3 servers you would think the world would be densely populated but I only saw 1 person.\n\n\nSo far this game is an 8/10 to me. I look forward to more people playing and the devs introducing new stuff. I actually like this more than ARK and a lot of other survival games and I think that is because it is more casual.","September 22, 2015","true","7.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Now 30 hours in and totally addicted.\n\nThe game does have a couple of bugs, and does crash every so often, but as it is an online game, no info is lost when crashing. Totally expected with early access.\n\nGame is very enjoyable with friends, and the community (at least on the Asia server), is generally very friendly and willing to help. It is also best with friends so that you can share out the work; such as one person specialising in carpentry, sewing, or farming. That way you can make the most progress in the least amount of time.\n\nIf you commit crimes and become marked as a criminal however, you will get attacked by about 20% of the people you come across in game. You aren't even safe in your own base. Recommend building up a base with walls before going rogue/getting into a guild war because of this.\n\nThere are some player griefers. We encountered 2 guilds who would come across and attempt to steal our things or attack us without provocation. They have only made up a very small part of the people we have come across, and so if you are someone who avoids games such as this for that reason, don't worry too much.\n\n10/10 would recommend, I would just say that it is best to find at least one other person you know to play with, because trying to level up all of your skills on your own would take a very long time.","April 25","true","106.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Is it worth it? Yes!\n\nTree of life is a survival RPG and multiplayer game. When I say it is a multiplayer game, I am not kidding. In order to get the most out of this game you will need some friends to play with. Also, you will need an external form of communication because this game does not offer global chat, so finding your friends will be nearly impossible without it.\n\nWhile this game is very enjoyable, it is by no means perfect. Since it is in early access you should expect that the game will drastically change from time to time. This can compltely change how you play the games at times. If you can put up with that, then you will have a blast.\n\nTree of life is very fun and deep, but I found myself gathering the same resources over and over again just to craft needed materials to level up my skills. I would also STRONGLY recommend buying the adventure pack because you will find that your item slots fill up very quickly. You can expect to build a lot of excess junk in the game and see a lot of it filling the world. Hope you like gathering materials!\n\nOverall, Tree of Life is a great early access game that, in some ways, feels like a completed game already. So, if you have a few friends, $20, and some times, then Tree of Life is the game for you!","June 19, 2015","true","29.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

However, you should take in mind that the game is in mid-development. There WILL be items that do not contribute to anything. There WILL be bugs that pi%# you off.

So i landed on a beach with no clue what to do. Walked over to a tree and punched it until it broke which was quite fun, then spent the next 10 minutes chasing a chicken. Killed said chicken eventually which made me sad as it was cute and i felt sorry for it but nevermind, i needed to eat and the apples i was getting from the trees weren' doing it for me. Picked up raw meat with no clue how to cook it. I eventually figured out how to make a campfire and cook the chicken, then spent the next hour fishing until i got attacked by a wolf, which i killed and ate. During daylight hours i walk for miles looking for a good place to call home. I got scared by a plant that was running towards me then i realised it was scared of me too. Found some unattended crafting stations so i made a shovel. No clue what to do with it but at least i have it. Enjoyed a picnic of fish, wolf meat and a botttle of booze.

In fact, I would liken this to a "civilization sim" as my friend once said (and no, not that silly pseudo-board game).  Some unique things I find nice are the fact there is no over-arching player level ala WoW, where you are level 100 and automatically 300 times better than that level 47.  There ARE levels for your individual skills though, and those are what give you your base stats.  For example, leveling Farming gives you a lot of Constitution and a little Strength (health and attack power, respectively).\n\nOne other and very important bit is that you can build anywhere at any time, save for places like steep slopes and water.  Constructing buildings lets you store things, craft things, keep baddies out, make your guild, all sorts of stuff.\n\nThere are no global chats.  There is no party system.  There is no friend system.  There is only local chat.  There is no "real" currency, and the only things you will be buying are from other players.  You can get bronze, silver, and gold coins from humanoid creatures, but those are also used to repair buildings given they are damaged.\n\nA criminal system is in place to let you do what you want to who you want, but with a potential price.  Sure, you can break down someone's walls that are in your way or steal something nice out of their cabin while they're away, but doing so puts you at risk of being hunted and losing your items and (if you're evil enough) experience.  Worth it, if you can pull it off, as everyone drops at least one item on death...\n\nBe forewarned, however, that it DEFINITELY has that Early Access feel to it.  Optimization is slightly poor, leading to some frame lag where there shouldn't be.  There's a strange desync-over-time issue that requires a simple re-log to fix.  There are imbalances in stats, slightly unbalanced gear, dodge from Dexterity hasn't even been implemented yet, some (less influential) skills seem to have no use other than to pump up a certain stat even though they imply otherwise, and there's apparently a magic system that there is a bar and stats for, but nothing in the game even brings it up or influences it.\n\nI'm wholly supportive of what this game can be, and what is there is already fun.  Note that as a single player experience it is probably empty - you need other players, friends or not, for it to even feel like a game.  The devs seem cool, even if they have trouble speaking english.  I don't regret buying the 4-pack and even the DLC to help development.\n\nYet.","June 19, 2015","true","639.5"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

I bought it, played it for a bit, then wrote a review (pretty much entirely for the free Adventurer Pack), which was previously positive. But now, as I played the game for almost 4 hours, I can safely say that's it's not very good in this state.\n\n\nPrice\n\nThis game costs $22 in Early Access. That would be fine if the game was more so near completion, but as it stands, it is not (but who knows, this was supposedly in alpha for 3 years). So, I suggest spending your $20 elsewhere.\n\nMechanics\n\nThere are some okay mechanics. The food system for example is not awful, although about 2/500 go down every few seconds, the abundance of food you manage to get pays for that. The mastery system is pretty balanced as well, but sadly that's it. The other core mechanics, building, PVPing, and whatnot are not very good in their current stage.\n\nBuildings work okay for the most part, but they easily break making it really annoying. Say you log out for something like 12+ hours. Then, when you log in most of your base is going to be destroyed by either monsters, or players. However, when you destroy building it goes into a destroyed state, where it stays for 24 hours, and can be repaired by coins. If you don't get back in that 24h, you can say goodbye to your base.\n\nPVPing works as follows: if you kill a yellow player, you become red. If you kill a red player, you stay your color. You can become red by destroying other players things, and by stealing things from people too. Being red however brings a huge disadvantage, and no advantages at all (it makes you drop all items .\n\nwill edit l8r again.","May 27, 2015","false","4.2"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

Yes I understand that this game is still in Beta, however, most beta games are constantly releasing new content to draw a larger and larger playerbase. This game doesnt seem to be trying to do that.\n\nAlso, If you have been playing it, apparently there are mice in this game that, if you arent on top of things, will destroy EVERYTHING you build. Also you cannot kill these said mice.\n\nI have stopped playing this game along with my friends, because of lack of new content being added to this game. since I started playing several months ago, there has been virtually NO new content added. All I keep seeing in the "update" logs for this game are, bug fix, bug fix, and, oh yeah, bug fix. While important, bug fixes cannot be the only thing that they keep doing, new content is needed to keep the current playerbase and new players interested in Tree of Life.\n\nLack of map wipes are also a problem. Too many bases strewn throughout the map, and, if you want to build something yourself, there is practically no room for it.\n\nOverall I would give the game a 6.5/10 but if they want to draw me and others who have left for the same or similar reasons back to Tree of Life, then they need to start adding new content","February 29","false","71.6"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","14","26","0","0"

The developers have balance the appearance of random stone.  While there is still a strong benefit to having a quarry in your possession, it is no longer game breaking to not have access to one.  I don't know if my post had anything to do with that change, but if it did, the devs respond to concerns very quickly.\n\nOverall 4/5:\nTons of fun and highly recommended to everyone.\n\nGameplay: 4/5:\nIt is very fun, and only slightly repetitive.  However, there is a large variety of things to do and if you bored, just take a break and pick something else.\n\nCO-OP: 5/5:\nThis game almost requires co-op to truly love it.  There are so many different skills and different paths to take that you can't do it all.  Getting a guild together to can help each other in ways that is truly fun.  If all you want to do is chop trees and collect rocks, you really will be as much of a benefit as the town planner/builder and the weapon/armor smith.\n\nSOLO: 4/5\nHowever, if you want to play solo it still works well.  You can get your own full base up and running and be partially skilled in everything.  I met a lady with quite the nice little base.  She just was kind to the people around her so they help protect her.\n\n\nBeing an open world MMO sandbox, really gameplay is all that really matters for a rating and it is fun.\n\nThere are still some graphical glitches and bugs that you need to logout and back in for, but it is relativly low for a Beta game.\n\nWith the exceptions of the ♥♥♥♥♥ fully blocking stones when they knew it was screwing over people, the majority of the people I have played with have been a pleasure and a lot of fun.  There were plenty of people who stole everything they could before we got our walls up and other who killed all our animals daily, but that is easily resolved by building walls (which is possible now that you can find stone under a 15min walk away to randomly find one).\n\n\n\n***Old Post***\n\nI love this game and absolutly hate giving it a do not recommend, but here I go.\n\nGameplay: 4/5\nLoads of fun.  Minus the stone epidemic.\n\nStone: 0/5\nMost of the resources in the game are random spawns all over.  This works and is fun.  However, Stone is not.  Stone spawns in an area, and with very few random stones (not enough to run a base off of), all the stone is in those locations.\n\nSo, here is a story of playing this game.\n\nDay 1:\nRun off literally 20min into the middle of nowhere.  Find a good flat area with all the resources relativly close.  Start building.\n\nDay 2:\nA couple other people settle near you, you are friendly and everyone gets along.  You help eachother, find nearby locations and share them with one another.\n\nDay 3:\nYou notice a person at each stone area building guild halls.  You walk over and express your concerns about them walling in all the stone.  They assure you they just want to be close to it.  There it plenty of stone so you don't worry about it.  No one guild could ever use up all the stone, so literally the only reason to block it off is if you are activly attempting to ruin other peoples game play for no reason other then to ruin other peoples game play.\n\nDay 4:\nThey have blue prints for walls completely surrounding the stone.  You ask what's going on.  They are rude and insult you.  You jump over the wall templates and try to get stone since you know it is going to be blocked off by the next day.  They start killing you.  Then again.  Then again.  Woohoo, this game is awesome isn't it?\n\nDay 5:\nNow you can't get stone and there is no point to playing anymore.  Yay for spending $15 for a flawed game that lets players be complete jerks with zero reprecussions.  No bother venturing out and finding a new area, the stone is all walled in by this point!","April 24","true","48.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","8"

If they are not sure it's worth it or not, I suggest go find "Let's Play" videos first to get an idea of what this game is about.\n\n2. There's PvP element. Some people hate it, some people don't mind it. The mechanics is simple: When you commit criminal act (stealing/attacking someone enough times/killing someone) your name will turn red for a duration. During this period anyone who kills you will make you drop your entire inventory. When you are a law-abiding citizen on the other hand, your name will be yellow. When you have yellow name tag, you only drop 1 RANDOM inventory item when you die, which is much easier to deal with. There are people who kill for fun and watch other people's hours of work go to waste in this game. If you can deal with that then this game might be enjoyable for you (me, for example, I don't get red names and I don't mind getting killed).\n\n3. The tech tree is hard to climb because at some point the skills need grinding. If grinding can be rated on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being tedious. I would rate this game's skill grinding a 5 or 6. Not too easy but also not exceedingly time wasting (plus some of you might enjoy the process of getting all the materials for grinding). Also there's no tutorial, so you are either on your own or you can try asking other people about things you don't know.\n\n4. This is a co-op/team game! You cannot master every skill by yourself. Working together is better in terms of productivity and safety. "Strength in numbers" is a very fitting description for this game.","May 31, 2015","true","476.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are many skill you can work for.  Many people asked you to join their guild.  But after you build up your guild, you will find that many lock pickers come to your camp STEALING everyday.  Finally,  you will found that, Keep all stuff in your inventory is the best way to keep it safe. or you use up 400+ hours to build a 4 layers wall.

Only that this game is 3D better graphics and it a hell of alot more fun.\neven as early access, the patches are coming is quiet frequently, and it seems that the devs really enjoy what they do.\n\nSome of the issues that I have though are\n- In the " mist " areas, you literally cant even see what is attacking you because the mist is so bloody dense\n- everywhere you go, there are dead camps ( people have either moved or stopped playing ) that continue to sit there. So you either have to physically destroy them or try to build around them.\nThere seriously needs to be a decay timer on camps that have been inactive for 21 days or something, not just invasion of mice.\n- the crafting grind for carpentry, between levels 15 and 18 makes me want to kick puppies.\n- the rate in which your food drops is almost insane\n-CANT REPAIR EQUIPMENT ( YET? )\n\nSome of the things I really like about this game.\n-huge map.\n-good respawn time on random resources\n-fairly stable game ( only DC every once in a while\n-people for the most part are pretty friendly\n-Alot of fun in general. Especially if you enjoy building and survival games\n-you can halt progression in skills manually\n-people not in your guild can help you build stuff\n-fishing in this game is actually enjoyable\n-even though you rip through food at a crazy rate, all that happens is that you just cant run anymore, in stead of taking damage over time.\n-game is actually really pretty\n-the music is suprisingly very relaxing.\n","May 4","true","215.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It won't be the next Minecraft breakthrough mostly because of the people out there who think it's fun to cause trouble.\nThis is a PvP game at it's core. Crafting is a main component to survive. Most of my interacrtions with people in the game have been plesant. One the other hand, there are enough people who sneak in and destroy your hard work or livestock that it can tear you up inside. Taking 3 hours to find and bring a chicken to my camp then having it killed while I was offline did not give me a warm fuzzy.\nIf you enjoy Don't Starve and Minecraft while wanting an MMO experience, this might be enjoyable.","May 2","true","52.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

My toughts about the game remains unchanged but the recent patch notes it's what made me have good toughts about the future of the game.\n\nFirst, i bought the game about 10 days ago and my 22hours of gameplay i played almost nonstop, and in all that time i didn't see a single scumbag ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that only wants to ♥♥♥♥ you , kill you and ♥♥♥♥ everything you do, like a lot of reviews are saying, aswell as other people saying it's easy to tank towers damage(i would get 1~3 shotted depending on the watchtower, but i'm not so well geared, keep that in mind).But that's my experience on the game so far, i can't really tell if the community is really toxic like people said on reviews, but for me, on those 22 hours, not a SINGLE scumbag so far.Most people actually helped me!\n\nThere's much more cons than pros and the cons are much more "heavy" than the pros. But the reason i think i recommend it will be after the pros and cons.\n\nPROS:\na) Crafting and progression are great, they are hard and slow, just like an RPG and being able to craft something new is really satisfying.I'm pretty sure that's what the game was supposed to be.\nb) Graphics are fancy in it's own way. It's not a GTA V graphics or whatever game that needs 5 GTX 99999999 TI BOOST(i'm exagerating, i know) to play at 60 FPS, but its excellent on what the devs wanted it to be.\nc) A complemment of the A topic: Looting it's hardcore, as it was supposed to be. You can't simply kill 2 or 3 mobs and craft 10 items to level up your skills, you must work hard, REALLY HARD to gather everything. You gonna need to destroy a loot of trees for one building or item, a lot of rocks for one building or item, a lot of mobs for one building or item, etc...I like that and that was the purpose of the game.\n\nCONS:\na) Kiting the mob to not lose 90% of your health because you are not geared enough it's impossible, specially for people who have lag like me. You constantly lure more mobs on you if you decide to kite, specially wolves, and it's extremelly unefficient because most of your attacks you'll miss. Kiting is impossible because there isn't a lock targeting option(not that i know , atleast) and THAT it's what make kiting mobs really ♥♥♥♥ing hard and miss a lot of your attacks. I believe it'll be implemented later.\n\nb)Maybe this part of the review comes from my lag, so keep in my that it might be wrong.\nMobs, except wolves and maybe other four legged aggressive mobs(and maybe high level mobs that i couldn't fight), don't give a ♥♥♥♥ to you. I'm serious,\nI can't count the amout of times i simply walked INSIDE a mob and it didn't give a flying ♥♥♥♥. It simply stood there, doing whatever he was doing and i didn't have to pick a fight. He only would attack me if i stopped in front of him and attacked him first. This thing annoy me so ♥♥♥♥ing much. It isn't a bad thing, but i hate it. It's a ♥♥♥♥ing RPG.Agaon, i'm not sure if that happens because i'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and don't know about the mobs i'm talking about or because i have lag. Forgive me because i'm probably ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting on this topic.\n\nc) I created my base about 10 days ago and so far, my watchtowers didn't deffend it a SINGLE time, it didn't shoot a SINGLE arrow, even when i lure mobs to it. Maybe this happens for the same reason my b) topic may be a failure, i don't know much about the mobs i'm talking about. But anyway, this is supposed to be a hardcore game and this disappointed me a lot, and i mean a REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING LOT. My experience so far in this game is: Do whatever you want without EVER being raided, attacked or annoyed by mobs trying to ♥♥♥♥ you or your base. You only get attacked by wolves or mobs you attack first. This is supposed to be a hardcore game as the devs said, and so far i got a free pass to do everything i ♥♥♥♥ing want without being bothered by anything. It's a huge disappointment as i expected a hardcore game. Some traillers even had mob invasions on a castle. I tought that would happen to me and i would actually have to SURVIVE those things. So far i only wasted my time crafting things and didn't had to bother about surviging AT ALL. AT ANY TIME.\n\nd) Currently there's no repair. I think it's going to be implemented later, but playing right now without it is a pain in the ♥♥♥. As I said on the a) PRO, things are hard to get and sometimes re-crafting things that break easily and are hard to obtain don't make the game hard, but really annoying. Most of the weapons i can craft last for about 5minutes if i go for a game-day of mob hunting.\n\ne) You can only create one character. I don't know if you can create more characters by buying more character's slots on the shop but still it's stupid.\n\nf) Lack of servers. No oceania / Latin america servers.\n\nAs you could see, much more cons than pros and the cons are much more "heavy" than the pros.\nBut reading some patch notes that came like 2~4 days after i bought the game made me think that this game WILL be good.\nMy base is at Resting place of the gods(i think that's how the place is called) and you need oil to build some structures, such as tinker's workshop. I had to walk 20 minutes to reach bears and other mobs that dropped this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ oil, more 20 to come back to my base, and the worse : As you saw on the d) CON, things are hard to craft and there's no repair, I'd walk for around 40 minutes straight to gather the ♥♥♥♥ing oil / big leather and come back, and  if i wanted to last more than 5 minutes on the farming, i should spend about 2 hours gathering resources for weapons.\n2~5 days later they fixed that.\n\nRock was ♥♥♥♥ing hard to find, a lot of people were gathering it and it wasn't abundant. It was a pain in the ♥♥♥ to gather rocks.\n2~4 days later they fixed that.\n\nBase wouldn't be bothered by some mobs.\n2~7 days later they made rats ♥♥♥♥ you base if you spend a lot of time far away from it.\n\nAnd that's pretty much it, even tough there's a lot of cons and i hate them a ♥♥♥♥ing lot, playing it for almost 2 weeks and they already fixed some things i hate about this game, and THIS make me believe the game will be good in the future.I actually want the game to be good, and i really think it will and that's why i recommend it.\nI'll edit it later if i find it necessary.\n","May 2","true","23.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you like Runescape, Ragnarok, and Minecraft, this is the game for you. I started to play this game because of a bad review I read. At the time it was overwhelmingly positive, with only a couple negative reviews. The worst negative review I could find read;\n\n"This game is too difficult, you have to eat food every two minutes, and you have to grind your skills for ages to level up and do anything useful. You can survive, but cannot thrive without other group members that know different skills than you."\n\nAll of those things sounded great to me, a fan of all three games I mentioned before. I like having to eat to stay alive, I like that it takes massive ammounts of grinding to level up, and I also like that you cannot do everything on your own. At first, we had a higher level player to help us get started. We quickly passed that player up, and he was relatively inactive, so he passed guild leadership to us.\n\nThat being said, I feel this game can be ruined for people in several different ways. The first, is if you cannot find anyone who wants to play with you. This game can be disheartening to play alone. The second, If you aren't used to leveling up like runescape, you may find this game too tedioius to continue. You have to spend hours chopping trees, and hunting for Copper ore unless you go balls to the walls for stealing from people or killing them. Thirdly, PVP. Like any game this game has PVP. However, the PVP in this game is pure trolling. You can steal from people, unlock their gates, kill/lure them, and kill their livestock.\n\nAfter all of these negatives, I would still recommend this game, because they continue to update regularly, almost weekly. Since playing they have activated two "I'm sorry" compensation buffs that I have greatly appreciated. I will continue to play this game in the future! I hope they add more content to keep me interesteing.\n\n\nP.S. I have heard some people say that their bug fixes outweight their content updates. I have seen quite a lot of content updates, but the but fixes IMO are necessarry. I do not mind entire bug fix updates if it makes the game more playable.

It can be a grind at times, but that goes hand in hand with a survival/crafting game.\n-Combat isn't super challenging, also comparable to minecraft.  Just have to size up your opponent, and then kite.  Fun though, oddly addicting because of watching your loot drop.\n-Worth the price, in my opinion, I would say the bugs are minor, and very easy to ignore... In fact, I haven't found many bugs myself.\n-Only real downside I can think of is how many "Misty Areas" there are in the world (which is huge!  Takes a long time to travel accross it) but there are a lot of inhabitable areas labeled as "Misty Areas" where it's rediculously foggy... this kinda.. well, it can be hard to find your own space to settle down.\n\nLENGTHY OPINION:\n\nThis game is great!  My wife and I play together and we love it.\n\nWill you need to invest time?  Most likely, if you want to get anything out of your experience on Tree of Life, yes... There will be time invested in your settlement/skills.\n\nCan my settlement be completely destroyed, leaving me with nothing?  Homeless!?  Alone!?!  LOST!?!\n\nYes... kinda.. well, no.  Yes, your settlement can be leveled, but enemies will leave "Marks of Evil" so that you can place bounties on them, or hunt the ninnies down yourself.\n\nAlso, when you die you do get to keep your skills, and you won't drop everything in your inventory, though I do notice that something from a random slot of your inventory does have a chance to drop.\n\nThe art style is cute!  The atmosphere is cute!  And once you do get a town rolling, it does feel pretty good, and it's nice to see other players come into your town to check your stores, or use your crafting buildings to create their own goods; so long as they are friendly and respect your hard work.\n\nFor the most part, the community is pretty damn good!  For what you can expect of a survival game anyways. ;)","April 20","true","29.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This removes the lockpickers ability to get into your base.\n-You have access to ground mounts only(Ranching level 20). seems about 50% to 60% speed boost.\n-Fishing is an easy way to always have food. as you need to eat quite frequently.\n-The crafting system is pretty fun, sometimes rare items drop, blue >purple>Orange which enable you to craft stronger versions of regular items such as weapons and armour.\n-PvP is not yet very developed. you are always quite safe because if anyone Attacks you they will turn yellow with a debuff and be attacked by any tower nearby, so all you have to do is run to a nearby base and you are safe.\n-PVP debuffs are Yellow which only lasts a munite then you are back to blue(nutral)., Red which can last hours and you lose allot of items if you die. and Pink, which is a a red criminal with a bounty on them. You can see them on the map.\n\nThis has been an intresting game. and If you like building and exploring you will probably enjoy it allot.","May 25","true","194.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Ofc there are ***holes as they are everywhere, but i've found friendly players mostly.\n-PLAYER BASE: Decent, the world is big but you are always meeting new players.\n-EXPLORING: Big map with different biomes to explore each with characteristic resources and creatures.\n-DEVS: They do listen & update!\n\nCons:\n\n-EARLY ACCESS: Expected bugs.\n-GRINDY: Sometimes it feels like woodcutting simulator.\n-SOLO PLAYERS: Will definetly have a bad time. This game is about making communities. You cannot be a master in every skill.\n-PLAYER ABUSE: Biggest issue so far imo. New players have it really hard to begin if they get harrassed/robbed/destroyed by stronger players.\n-MAP: Not finished. It has some misty zones that are annoying.\n-TIME CONSUMING.\n\nOverall, great Survival RPG which is MUCH more enjoyable when playing with friends.\n\nFor those concerned about the negative reviews, most of them are from people playing alone who have been robbed.\nUnlike other games of this genre there's at least a criminal system, which is not perfect, but it is better than nothing.","May 29","true","160.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

When I do play games, I usually gravitate toward the easier and more relaxing games.  My favorite games are games like The Sims, Harvest Moon, and Animal Crossing.\nIn this game you are a survivor from a ship wreck.  You play online with other survivors, all trying to make a new life on the island.  The game involves a lot of harvesting and searching for items, and then crafting buildings and defenses to help your new village survive against mobs and other survivors.\nThe game is still in early access, so keep that in mind; but it is definitely worth purchasing, even in its early form.\n","July 2, 2015","true","85.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

Since it is a persistant, always active world, when you log out for the night then log in the next day theres a good chance everything you've built will be destroyed.\n\n2. Building on 1, this game needs private servers or a single player version of the game. It took me hours to get a decent base of operations set up and over night it was all gone.\n\n3. This one is minor compared to the others but the day/night cycle should be closer to 70%/30% not 50%/50%. When it's night time you can't even see your own character.\n\nI enjoy just about everything else that this game is doing and since its still in early access I'm hoping they make some of these changes.

There's a lot of interesting things in it but far more needs to be improved.\n\nStarting with some interesting stuff:\n\nYour character gains levels in one of several skills by accomplishing tasks. Logging skill is gained by chopping trees, tailoring skill by sewing, etc. This system allows you to specialize in a few areas so your guildmates can have easily defined tasks and work together better. There's a limit to how many levels you can earn in total, but you can lock out a skill from gaining levels so you're not wasting any in an area you don't plan to use.\n\nThe characters and landscape are cute and brightly colored. Character creation is limited to hair, skin color, face and eyes, but character models can still look fairly different if you try hard enough.\n\nThere is a sense of accomplishment when you go from one tier of a skill to the next, unlocking different things to craft. It makes you feel like you're making progress, even if you're not decked out in the best gear in the world.\n\nWhy I can't recommend it:\n\nThe skill system is definitely meant for multiplayer, which creates a glaring problem: Each character has to start out somewhere, and at this stage, that somewhere is rarely with a group of people who've chosen different specializations. For the higher tier items and buildings, you need to reach out to other skills for certain ingredients. Most people will start out solo, testing the waters before they get into a guild. The game needs to account for that, possibly with a tutorial level or time period before specialization is implemented.\n\nThe hunger system is a nuisance at best. At least in the early stages, there doesn't seem to be an option to slow or halt the speed at which a character loses hunger points. The amount of points you get from certain edible items also don't make sense. An apple gives 50 points; a cooked apple only gives something around 27, but a cooked maggot gives 80? Going hungry slows you down and stops your hp regen, which is fair, but it happens so often during a single day/night cycle that it almost forces you to specialize in cooking to keep up.\n\nThe guild system also needs a lot of work. I personally experienced an issue when I joined a guild with two other members. We were working together to build a base and put guild locks on all of our houses/shelters. Then, out of nowhere, the two guildmates decided to delete their characters. That immediately disbanded the guild, which also left me unable to access the other buildings with guild locks.\n\nStarter objects such as campfires and workbenches are scattered everywhere from newbies who gave the game a try for a few hours. That makes the landscape look far more populous than it is. I played on the American server and probably only ran into a few people at a time, and only one that looked like they invested some time in the game.\n\nUltimately, this is a rough gemstone that needs a lot of polish. It has potential and it killed a few hours while I was ill, but there are far better Early Access survival games out there for your money.","April 29","false","11.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Lovely!\n\nI had previously submitted suggestions regarding mounts, and the flute system. Now I'm having a new issue. Every single saddle I try to tame a bred bull with, even though it had a cowbell on it, slips off.\n\nI spent a whole real day gathering materials for almost 10 saddles, and every single one slipped off. A week or so ago, when I first tamed a bull that I had captured, the saddle worked on the first try. Even then, I had an issue with the flute and its 8 uses being not enough. Now I'm spending more than 50% of my game-time, grinding to make saddles that don't even work. I'm level 34 ranching for Christ's sake. This should not be happening.\n\nThis basically forces users to purchase the Wild Zaka if they ever want to use a mount. It's absurd. I am writing a negative review on this game and halting game play permanently until this is resolved. The game isn't fun anymore. It's pointless. I have almost 120 hours on my account and most of those were getting materials and skills needed to make saddles, only to find out that now they're almost useless.","May 10","false","355.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

While it's true that you can play this game solo, it's going to be incredibly hard and frustrating. At the core, the game is not designed for you to do everything on your own; you'll notice this by the vast amount of skills available, and only a few that you can master. You'll need to rely on others to access higher level craftings, just as they will need to rely on you based on your own expertise. If you decide to go the solo way, you'll only be able to access mediocre level crafts be it for defense or offence,\n\nA community (guild) provides a lot of things:\n\n_ Safer environment: if you have a reputable guild, almost no one will attack you, and your base and belonging will be very safe.\n_ Play your way: due to the safe nature of your environment, you are free to play the way you want, hardcore, pvp, pve, or very casualy.\n_ Mentoring: like many have said, the learning curve for a new player can be very daunting, joining a guild of experienced players can smooth that a lot. We teach and provide guidance to all our members old or new.\n_ Skill sharing: as I said in the beginning, you wan't master all the skills yourself, but in a guild you can have a master in each skill willing to offer his/her competences. So everybody benefits.\n_ Starting Gear: most guids will provide the new members with full sets of gear, and virtually unlimited food access. That alone will jumpstart the game experience for many new players.\n_ Friends: last but not least, being part of a community will bring you many new friends who will enhance your game experience.\n\n\n2) Be Creative\n---------------\n\nThis is very important, it's a lot more to what people would call a sandbox game. Here you create your own goals and objectives, there are no set quests to do or anything forcing you in any direction. You decide how you want to play the game.\n\nHere are some common starter goals:\n\n_ Maxing out skill points: get specialize in 8 skills (all level 50), that alone will take you a lot of time.\n_ Build a formidable base: does this ever ends?\n_ Get the best gear possible: find the best materials, craft them with the best skills.\n_ Survive the highest level of Monster Invasion: Your base will be raided by monsters in epic events, can you survive?\n\nHere are some more diverse goals:\n\n_ Visit the entire map.\n_ Help new players.\n_ Shape the world (my favorite, I spend most of my time, crafting roadways, doing landscaping making our surrounding beautiful and practical)\n_ Become a traveling merchant. Lots of players like to do that, especially more solo oriented players.\n_ Open trading/crafting zone for all.\n_ etc...\n\nReally it's all up to you, the main point I'm trying to make is that maxing out your skills isn't the endgame here, just a part of the game to allow you to do even more.\n\n\n3) OOG is a small company\n----------------------------\n\nNot trying to be an excuse for them, but once you acknowledge the fact that the devs are a small group, and the game has and will have some bugs and glitches, that things take time to be developped, you'll get a lot less frustrated when a problem occurs.\n\nTree of Life has so much to offer in terms of fun that it would too bad to spoiled that enjoyment by focusing on the little things that weight it down.\n\n\n4)  Debunking Major Complains\n---------------------------------\n\n_ ToL is P2W (Pay To Win): No, just no. people have been complaining about the cash shop items as being P2W. The store provides a mount that allows you to travel faster; well be informed that anyone can also have a mount in game for free, relatively easily. The store provides a bag with 14 slots storage capacity; here again not P2W at all, I can and do craft in game 15 slots bags to my fellow guildmembers, that is more storage and for free. If I have a complain about the cash shop, it's not that it's P2W, but rather too limited in choices, and the prices too high in my opinion. People who buy from the store do that mostly to support the game developers.\n\n_ ToL is not for casual players: Wrong, get a good guild and you'll play as casualy as you want. Some of us just like to log in to chat or farm a few plots of land only.\n\n_ In ToL PVP is everywhere: Like all games there are Dbags, but in all truth, most of the PVP can be avoided easily. In 550 hours of gameplay, I got killed only once, and mostly because I let the other player do it. Being part of a good guild will ensure that you are not randomly attacked, and that if you are, retribution will come.\n\n\nANNEXE: MY CURRENT ISSUES\n\n_ Communication with the devs is still a big issue, both due to the fact that replies are rare and limited, as well as the language barrier. Alice is trying her best, but then again there's just so much one can do.\n\n_ Support virtually inexistant. If you have  a problem and report it, it will most likely fall in deaf ears... they won't even bother acknowledging your problem, they just won't reply at all. (most of the time)\n\n_ Memory Leak, the game is far from being fully optimize and regular memory leaks force you to reboot the game after a few hours online or the game will lag to hell or crash by itself.\n\n_ Game mechanics, yes there's some finetuning to do here, but I won't complain too much since they are patching albeit slowly, regularly. Just need to be patient here.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWith over 500 hours (and many more to come), I have more than my money worth in this game. I have a great time when I'm online, and got to make great friends too with who I can enjoy this game and others!","May 16","true","800.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","5","9","2","1"

WIth no intro tutorial you are left to try and figure things out. Which is okay because I've played and love other crafting games. However you are naked, almost starving and monsters are a few steps away. This is not fun. When you do craft something the payoff is very little and your wondering why you even tried. Next, you are constantly worried about your stats. Games are supposed to be easy and fun in the beginning and ramp up. This game is a slog to try to get to a point where you break even. Playing with friends is a must and make sure you log in often because the hard work you spent will decay over time. Night-time is LONG and pitch black. The cartoony style hides the fact that this game is difficult and hard to like. Trolls and Greifers prey on newbies. I get the impression that if this game ever gets out of beta microtransactions will creep into it. However like other games I feel this will probably be abandoned by developers within the year because interest will fall off.","June 7, 2015","false","2.0"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","1"

Trees. Everything you do revolves around trees. Every profession requires trees. You and your friends will spend about 75% of your time cutting down trees, cutting logs, harvesting firewood and crafting things from that firewood. Burning the firewood (for charcoal). Refining the firewood for building materials. And on and on and on.\n\nNow, the game overall has huge, almost Minecraft-like, potential. Early access is exactly that, early access. I make no assumption about how the game will develop or its end goals. But, I can't recommend a game where the 3 quarters of my first 30 hours of my gameplay were spent chopping and harvesting trees. Between the animations, travel times, harvesting time and refining time, the end product was bittersweet. Great me and my 2-5 man guild built a defense tower. Only 10 more to go. Just finished a length of wood wall for our castle. Great, only 3 more to go.\n\nA good rebuke would be to find a larger guild more active guild. As is common with the survival genre. However, even then, I have a gut feeling that my played-time would still be mostly chopping wood.\n\nAside from the crafting woes, which lets be serious this game is all about, combat is still rough. Bunny hopping, circling strafing is rampant. Weapons (which all require wood to craft) are simplistic. Nothing really gave me a wow moment. Magic is not in the game at the time of this post. But, I'll make the jump that it will be OP, especially if there is no-miss chances and proximity issues, as there is with melee combat.\n\nRecommendation right now is to wait, maybe a month or year. Never can tell with the early-access buys.\n\nGood luck,\n","April 28","false","33.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

Not very many, but every so often I have another go.  To be fair, it's rubbish.  One of the silliest bits is the day/night cycle.  During the 'night' you can't really do anything, so close on half the time in the game is lost while you sit in total darkness.  You can light a torch, but that doesn't shorten the 'night'.\n\nThen the help system is diabolical.  As with many other games, all the help is provided by users posting individual documents. That's OK, and I applaud their efforts, but it is not organised in any way and I find it almost impossible to find the help I need.  At least, within a reasonable time.\n\nIf  you can put up with all that, then you will be frequently 'killed' by the various monsters.  You can then turn into a 'ghost' and wait for long minutes to return to life.  You can shorten this wait by finding Soul Pieces, but that doesn't reduce the time-wasting.\n\nThis is not a game that you can play, either for the odd half-an-hour of spare time you have  or for a whole evening, and come away with a sense of satisfaction.  I feel more like throwing the PC through the window, which would be rather expensive.  Mind you, I don't dare calculate what I've spent on PC and Mac games that, like this one, just aren't really very good.","June 28, 2015","false","9.5"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

I must agree that there are still too many bugs in this time of early access or maybe it's so called an Alpha Test, which is for sure have made some stuffs not fun anymore. Like the fortress you had been building for days with all of your heart keep getting teared down by zombies or your precious items stolen by criminals. It was so frustrating, but even though so, this game has a real something that if it developed correctly, the result will be overwhelming. I alwas hate lagging server or high latency, but instead of buying only a copy of this game, I bought 3 copies @_@, all for a friend and one family member. I think that's insane ! I've never done this before.\n\nOnce again, for me I have a very high expectation for the next bug fixes and re-balancing patches. And of course I do recommend this game to you, but don't play this game too deep, not yet, you should play it calmly, not yet to spend too many time of your life because it will be useless at this early stage of development.

Well, its already full in the America server. 4x is a lie, unless the map was SO tiny before that it could only host 20 bases.\n\nThis is the worst survival game i have ever played in my life. Crafting system is awful, no info and bad rates. To make a hut seems like i need to do 4-5 steps just to make a 1x1 hut to sleep in. To make any good items you need to level up certain skills that require you to make hundreds of useless items (that you can only carry 20ish at a time) in order to level up enough to get anything worth it. Which brings me to my last point of this crafting system NO REPAIR OPTIONS! You know that armor you spent all week getting? Well its broke, and now you gotta do it again. Stupid.\n\nThe combat is just as bad, you cant target enemies, they attack MUCH faster than you do, and you will die when just starting out. You might as well run until you can train up a skill enough to protect yourself, or you know, suck up to a bigger guild.\n\nThe skill system is the only thing about this game i enjoyed, but still it was so horribly implemented it wasn't worth the rest of the game, not to mention that this is highly dependant on the crafting system, which as stated before IS AWFUL.\n\nThe community IN-Game is pretty bad, swinging starts before any communication. People will take ♥♥♥♥ right out of your bench in front of you, which is normal for a survival game, but this is just in-game. outside of the game there is NO community at all. Barely anyone knows about this game and none of them talk about it.\n\nMap Size is VERY VERY tiny, even with the expansion. I played a few survival games, and i could find a plce to build that wasn't a stones throw away from another player. The servers are already ful within 5 days of the Wipe. Its a joke.

Now, combine that with friends and the fun is multiplied.\n\nIt is really fun and has a quite interesting concept, but there is one undeniable truth that must not be overlooked: it is an early access game. However, by this I don't mean it's buggy (we actually had a bug-free long session of play), what I do mean is that it's still terribly unbalanced in the whole PVP/Crime system. In brief, if you pretend to play as a responsable, moral player, it's gonna be great while you're actually in-game (since people are pretty nice and conversative), but the second you stop playing, there is a 90% chance the next time you log in, you will find your nice, little settlement burned, destroyed and viciously raided. And there is nothing you can do to prevent this; you can protect your base against monsters (which is kind of weak, since the "auto-turrets" do so little damage and cost so much), but not against players. Players can destroy everything you built and nothing happens to them.\n\nThe system punishes your "crimes", which are killing players who are not red and lockpicking other player's stashes. The punishment is making you a red player (red players drop everything when killed). But what happens to destroying another players property or trespassing? Stealing crops and killing my livestock animals is not considered a crime, so everyone can do it the second my crops and animals enter their vision. If you try to defend your stuff against a non-red player, and eventually kill him, you will turn red. They know this and use them to their advantage; you can't kill them, all you can do is watch as they raid your little village and type stuff, unless you really want to kill them and turn red. If you decide to kill them and turn red, they will spawn back and kill you, taking all the stuff you are carrying, and they won't turn red because they are killing a "criminal".\n\nThis is the only thing that truly prevents me from reviewing this game as positive, since I find this is a joy-killing broken feature. I do not mind a PVP world, as long as I can actually do something to protect what's mine.\n\nI do hope developers come out with some way to balance this broken system so I can go back and enjoy this evolving world.

It is at the crossroads in how the game will be, either the dev do nothing and allow the typical troll to run around killing new players, or they do something like a duel system forcing accepting of both players to prevent this.  Its a great game, and once they deal with the trolls it could reach epic status.

There are a few things I'd change, but all in all it's a pretty fantastic experience.  You can do pretty much anything you want.  Build a town or larger, group with others in guilds, choose a profession or several.  You can trade resources and being a merchant isn't uncommon.  You can be an adventurer and wander from town to town looking for quests(or supplies they need) and make trades in that way.  The game is a lot to learn, which is nice.  It's a fresh start on a open world block building type game.  So far I'm enjoying it alot.  Server rollbacks are a big issue, but it's still in alpha so you have expect some bugs.

The only thing that was removed by the developers was the gold, everything else remains in the game. Even the players were not banned, even though the developers claimed that exploiters would be.\n\nSo I ask you this, why bother trying to level up your masteries and build your base legitimately when so many cheated their way to the top? Why bother trying to collect rare resources to craft the top gear when you will never be able to honestly collect the amounts the cheaters have saved in stores?\n\nMaybe, and that is a big maybe, it will be worth trying this game if they wipe everything and restart.

Patch changes make the game much worse, in that crafting things is pointless due to durability losses of weapons and armor.  This game needs tons of dungeons and several PvP mechanics to be worthwhile.  I don't foresee them adding any decent content like that for probably a year as they are a small dev team.\n\nPvP is very lacking and I doubt they will be able to add a different system, as it is already laggy with slow response times on actions.

You can easily break a top-tier weapon weapon in an hour, and these weapons take a lot of materials to create. Armor wears out fast too and is also very time consuming to make.\n\nThe devs gave a wishy-washy answer as to if they are going to correct this.\n\nThey also radically changed PvP rules.\n\nThe above dramatically impacted the player population and now it is hard to even find another player online.\n\nThe devs also have an issue balencing material collection efficency. They nerfed the ways trees drop samplings so that deforestation will be an ever bigger problem then before. There were whole tracks of barren land where all the trees were cut down. This means no wood and wood is central to all building and crafting.\n\nI get the impression the devs want us to spend hours gatehring enough wood to build just a few things; this is a typical Asian MMO mindset. It also seems like the devs have not learned the lessons that other MMOs have delt with over the past 15 years or so (eg.g Griefing, duping, Skill loss, grinding tredmills, no fast travel, etc.) Often they try to balance one thing and horribly break other things in the process.\n\nThier net code is poor so there are out-of sync issues making PvP wonky sometimes.\n\nThis is alpha; maybe they will fix things maybe they won't.","June 2, 2015","false","185.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You can pvp, but it is discouraged as harming another player or their structure turns your name red for all players to see and you can be attacked by defensive towers. You also lose xp and items when you die. This game is enjoyed more with friends or a guild than solo. You can level up a ton of different skills, but you can't max everything so you must focus on certain ones.

It brings the true meaning to MMO where cooperation is pretty much essential for the enjoyment of the game.\n\nThe crafting system is relitively simple, however requires commitment to a few trades rather than trying to master all the crafting options.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadowpk02/recommended/361800/","shadowpk02","Slothdough","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadowpk02/","250 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game reaches far beyond my expectations. For an early access, it runs quite smooth. Sure, there are bugs, but that's what early access is all about. Finding bugs for the developers to fix.\n\nGameplay:The gameplay runs smoothly. I've also enabled v-sync, so my fps stays a steady 60 fps to prevent screen tearing.\nThe dragging of items through the inventories feels a bit weird to me. This is not a big deal but might need some improvement. Im sure they will polish this and other features when the core mechanics are in place.\n\nCommunity:The community is really nice. I've been killed 0 times by players till this time (3.5 hrs playtime). I've been in one fight however. But that was at the very beginning of the game. I spawned and someone tought i'd be an easy kill. I did kill him, however, I got a red name for murder. This made me drop my items upon dead. So the only thing I have to say about the community: Great! Which is pretty rare with a game like this. Normally I worry about loosing my stuff. But for as long as you don't kill others, you won't loose your own stuff either. That's probably the reason why the community is so friendly. They've implented this and works very well. I've got to give them that.\n\nDevelopment teamThey are really active with their community. When there is a restart, they will let people know in-game. Which is good ofcourse. Also, they fix bugs very quickly. There was one bug that made enemies invisible. Because of this, you couln't see then nor attack them. Guess what? The next day, they released a patch to fix both the invisible enemies. Also, they left a small explanation of why this happened which shows how much they care about their community.\n\nBugs & ErrorsSomething I noticed, were the spelling errors. While not big a deal, they might wanna fix this later on. Im not that great at english myself too, so I don't really mind.\n\nGraphically, it all looks a bit empty. The world is really empty. You see a lot of trees and sometimes flowers, food etc. But when you are on the plains, it's just a flat world with some grass. But I'm sure they will add detail later since this isn't really a MUST for an early access game. It's all about fixing bugs right?\n\nWhile i'm at it:\nThere is a weird bug where the world starts to flash. It's kind of annoying. Im not sure if im the only one but if i Alt+tab and go back to the game, it seems to fix it. Now, this might has something to do with my crossfire setup. Gonna find out soon.\n\nScores: Since this isn't a finished game yet, I will not look at the bugs. Simply because they aren't game breaking.\nGameplay: 8/10 - Combat is a bit too fast paced. Other than that, it plays smoothly.\nGraphics: 7/10 - Looks nice in it's own way but is not detailed enough.\nCommunity: 8/10 - Really friendly community. Finally a pvp game where KOS isn't a problem.\nDevelopment team: 9/10 - Very close with their community. Also fixes problems in a day or less. Listens to the community.\nBugs & errors: 11/10 - Do what they are supposed to do, obviously.\n\nIf you are looking at this game, and you aren't sure if you should buy it or not. I'd say you should. What can you loose other than your money?... Wait... No but seriously. Stop doubting and buy the game. You won't regret it.","May 29, 2015","true","15.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Now, combine that with friends and the fun is multiplied.\n\nIt is really fun and has a quite interesting concept, but there is one undeniable truth that must not be overlooked: it is an early access game. However, by this I don't mean it's buggy (we actually had a bug-free long session of play), what I do mean is that it's still terribly unbalanced in the whole PVP/Crime system. In brief, if you pretend to play as a responsable, moral player, it's gonna be great while you're actually in-game (since people are pretty nice and conversative), but the second you stop playing, there is a 90% chance the next time you log in, you will find your nice, little settlement burned, destroyed and viciously raided. And there is nothing you can do to prevent this; you can protect your base against monsters (which is kind of weak, since the "auto-turrets" do so little damage and cost so much), but not against players. Players can destroy everything you built and nothing happens to them.\n\nThe system punishes your "crimes", which are killing players who are not red and lockpicking other player's stashes. The punishment is making you a red player (red players drop everything when killed). But what happens to destroying another players property or trespassing? Stealing crops and killing my livestock animals is not considered a crime, so everyone can do it the second my crops and animals enter their vision. If you try to defend your stuff against a non-red player, and eventually kill him, you will turn red. They know this and use them to their advantage; you can't kill them, all you can do is watch as they raid your little village and type stuff, unless you really want to kill them and turn red. If you decide to kill them and turn red, they will spawn back and kill you, taking all the stuff you are carrying, and they won't turn red because they are killing a "criminal".\n\nThis is the only thing that truly prevents me from reviewing this game as positive, since I find this is a joy-killing broken feature. I do not mind a PVP world, as long as I can actually do something to protect what's mine.\n\nI do hope developers come out with some way to balance this broken system so I can go back and enjoy this evolving world. Only then I will change this review.","June 3, 2015","false","14.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It is at the crossroads in how the game will be, either the dev do nothing and allow the typical troll to run around killing new players, or they do something like a duel system forcing accepting of both players to prevent this.  Its a great game, and once they deal with the trolls it could reach epic status.

As I spawned into the world for the first time, I found a crude, crude dagger placed by my feet.  I looked up at the sky, knowing that this must be a part of the Great Design.  Fate.  The dagger called out to me, as if whispering sensually, "pick me up... pick me up." I picked up the blade.\n\nIt was at that precise moment that I saw him, and it all made sense.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadowpk02/recommended/361800/","shadowpk02","Slothdough","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadowpk02/","250 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game reaches far beyond my expectations. For an early access, it runs quite smooth. Sure, there are bugs, but that's what early access is all about. Finding bugs for the developers to fix.\n\nGameplay:The gameplay runs smoothly. I've also enabled v-sync, so my fps stays a steady 60 fps to prevent screen tearing.\nThe dragging of items through the inventories feels a bit weird to me. This is not a big deal but might need some improvement. Im sure they will polish this and other features when the core mechanics are in place.\n\nCommunity:The community is really nice. I've been killed 0 times by players till this time (3.5 hrs playtime). I've been in one fight however. But that was at the very beginning of the game. I spawned and someone tought i'd be an easy kill. I did kill him, however, I got a red name for murder. This made me drop my items upon dead. So the only thing I have to say about the community: Great! Which is pretty rare with a game like this. Normally I worry about loosing my stuff. But for as long as you don't kill others, you won't loose your own stuff either. That's probably the reason why the community is so friendly. They've implented this and works very well. I've got to give them that.\n\nDevelopment teamThey are really active with their community. When there is a restart, they will let people know in-game. Which is good ofcourse. Also, they fix bugs very quickly. There was one bug that made enemies invisible. Because of this, you couln't see then nor attack them. Guess what? The next day, they released a patch to fix both the invisible enemies. Also, they left a small explanation of why this happened which shows how much they care about their community.\n\nBugs & ErrorsSomething I noticed, were the spelling errors. While not big a deal, they might wanna fix this later on. Im not that great at english myself too, so I don't really mind.\n\nGraphically, it all looks a bit empty. The world is really empty. You see a lot of trees and sometimes flowers, food etc. But when you are on the plains, it's just a flat world with some grass. But I'm sure they will add detail later since this isn't really a MUST for an early access game. It's all about fixing bugs right?\n\nWhile i'm at it:\nThere is a weird bug where the world starts to flash. It's kind of annoying. Im not sure if im the only one but if i Alt+tab and go back to the game, it seems to fix it. Now, this might has something to do with my crossfire setup. Gonna find out soon.\n\nScores: Since this isn't a finished game yet, I will not look at the bugs. Simply because they aren't game breaking.\nGameplay: 8/10 - Combat is a bit too fast paced. Other than that, it plays smoothly.\nGraphics: 7/10 - Looks nice in it's own way but is not detailed enough.\nCommunity: 8/10 - Really friendly community. Finally a pvp game where KOS isn't a problem.\nDevelopment team: 9/10 - Very close with their community. Also fixes problems in a day or less. Listens to the community.\nBugs & errors: 11/10 - Do what they are supposed to do, obviously.\n\nIf you are looking at this game, and you aren't sure if you should buy it or not. I'd say you should. What can you loose other than your money?... Wait... No but seriously. Stop doubting and buy the game. You won't regret it.","May 29, 2015","true","15.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Made my character, spawned in, and got greeted by another survivor! We ran around, he helped me get a few basic things like bangages and a paddle, so I ran after a deer, and spent a few minutes trying to kill that. He died, I think, and I lost him.

Everywhere you look, there are unfinished eye sore settlements. If you find somewhere in an area they just release, it's only a matter of a day or two until you log in and you are literally surrounded by people's random buildings. Criminal system is bugged, targeting for the entire game is god awful. Huge imbalances in PvP. The community is ♥♥♥♥ too, much like Albion Online. It seems to be a recent trend with modern sandboxes that the player base is made up of illiterate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ millenial ♥♥♥♥boys. If you are not in a guild the game is literally impossible to play and make any sort of advancement, because you will always be getting ganked. Also, the developers are incapable of speaking anything but Korean and broken English. The game itself is very unprofessional and not in a funny cute way.

If you see those with bad experience in this game, that mostly because they are playing alone for too long. Yes this game might be hard and cruel if you play alone, but try to find some friends and I guarantee you will have some fun. at first I also played this game alone, i find it hard but luckily I make friends with people in game, mostly they're nice (if u too are nice with them) joined their guild and now I'm suggesting this game to all of my friends.\nI do have some suggestion for the devs though, yes it is true that your bounty system is not useful. people with low level and without protection from friends are a target of bully from criminals. how about make a safe areas? or newbie protection for a week. Having a real city to do transaction is also not a bad idea.\nAnyway good job Devs, i hope a lot more improvements come along.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LegendDoyle/recommended/361800/","LegendDoyle","Doyle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LegendDoyle/","47 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nUPDATED REVIEW 01/05/16\n\nOVER 170 HOURS GAME PLAY\n\nAfter the BETA update I decided to also update my review for the game there are some changes.\n\nTree of Life interesting survival game which has great potential but whether or not the developers communicate or not is a different matter. Currently in beta so it has many bugs and various issues but also some MAJOR issues which I will get in to.\n\nIn Tree of Life's current state there is much to improve on but there is still a lot of content there for everyone to enjoy so if you do wish to play Tree of Life in its beta state then please remember it is not the full game but you will have a good time depending on your neighbours.\n\nGame play:\n\nTree of Life contains 25 skills that you can progress in which you can max only 8 so if you wish to become a fighter or builder then you can do so and ignore the skills you do not wish to progress in. However, there are some skills which you may not wish to progress in but you will be forced to level in e.g. If you want to create a weapon but that weapon requires an item that only a Tinkerer can create.\n\nPvE:\nThere is a small amount of PvE but I think they are starting to focus on more of this. The basics are there but it is VERY basic. They have some "plans" in the making apparently, such as dungeons. But this has not been revealed exactly so who knows what they will be adding.\n\nPvP:\nThere is much PvP which can be good or bad. PvP is extremely unbalanced as you can grief players by building all around their base and nothing can be done about it. The game punishes you If you try to prevent a griefer by turning you hostile rather than the griefer.\n\nGrind:\nThis game is one of the biggest grinds I have seen in any game! The map is 4x bigger but you may have to travel for about 30mins to reach a special type of tree but as you reach your destination, there are none around as it has been farmed. You will be running back and forth for hours on end.\n\nWood Cutting Simulator:\nBecause there is a huge grind and that most items need wood, you will be cutting trees all day everyday! It is painfully slow and boring to cut wood and sometimes you may not even get any wood from a tree. I dint mind a small grind but the woodcutting is ridiculous!\n\nIn-Game Shop:\nThere is a shop where you can spend real money of items. This is fine and so far they are just bags with more slots and a mount. The only problem is the price. The prices for these items are extremely expensive. A mount costs £15.41 and the game costs £14.99!! Not only that but that mount is apparently 10% off!\n\nSome Concerns:\nI have around 100 hours into this game so far, made lots of friends (and enemies) and found a very friendly and active guild where we have spent a very long time improving our base and skills. I am having lots of fun but do get very frustrated with what has been updated in the game.\n\nNow we have had a map wipe on 18/04/16 which is perfectly fine as it let us start from scratch, we were told the map would be 4x bigger (woohoo!), better graphics and more items etc have been added. Fantastic right? Wrong! 4x bigger is correct but they have hidden over half of the map! Covered it with thick fog not allowing us to see a thing and not allowing us to build in these areas! We were not told this before the map wipe so we had to suffer in silence.\n\nCommunication seems to be the biggest concern for me. There is some on the forum but if you dont sign up there then you will not be able to get as many updates. I know this is the beta but i feel like we have all been taken for a ride than we never wanted.\n\nPros:\nGreat graphics (it's not everyones cup of tea).\nMany skills to choose from and level.\nHuge map.\nPVP/PVE (You don't have to PVP but prepare for it).\nCriminal System (Not developed very well).\nBounty System (Not developed very well).\nFriendly developers (When they actually communicate).\nFeels different from other survival/sandbox games.\nMonster villages which will attack player bases.\nJust the right amount of challenge.\n\nCons:\nPunishment for friendly players\nThick fog not allowing players to see/build half of the map.\nCommunication is very poor.\nBugs (It is Beta!).\nVery little player customisation.\nIf your base is close to a raiding guild then prepare to log in every day to a raided base.\nNo fast travel on such a large map.\nReal money in game shop is very expensive! For a bag it costs nearly as much as the actual game!\n\nVERDICT:\nDO NOT BUY IN CURRENT STATE!\nIn the games current state I would say wait a few more months. I hope they listen to our concerns because this game is not even in a beta stage in my opinion. They labeled it beta to get a flood of new customers and the game needs a hell of a lot more added to it. The only thing that keeps me playing Tree of Life is my guild members. We have put so much time into it that we do not want to put it to waste.","April 1","false","176.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Although it gets a little bit boring if you don't find company.\nAlso, for me it was a little bit uncomfortable to leave my stuff in huts, and if I don't show up whithin a day, something with happen with them (even when I use locks). Furthermore: why only to character is avaiable? Okay, you can change the hair and the color of eyes, but it feels not that much. Creating more varation wouldn't take that much of time.\nAnd, there is so many unfinished buildings, started guilds without players! It would be great if guild hall would be hard to build, maybe more people get in the same party this way, which is good if you're playing with an mmorpg.\n\nI recommend it because in the other side I had fun with it and will probably play more. It's really relaxing and sometimes you get excited by finding new stuff for building, crafting etc.\nAnd yes, this is an early access, I'm sure it will be more interesting in the end as the developers listen to the reviews.","May 8","true","15.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You can build anywhere! Guilds are also implemented and have a lot of options. This game is early access, so not everything is done. However, you probably wouldn't notice that its early access if they didn't tell you. It plays like a finished game (no major bugs).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Divinion/recommended/361800/","Divinion","Divinion (Aurjay)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Divinion/","267 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nUpdated Review: May 2016\n\nCurrent Recommendation: Still should hold off on purchasing this game. Changes from past review and reasons below.\n\n+ The Criminal system has been worked on and seems a lot better. A huge plus from the original review.\n\n+ The random damage over time from absolutely nothing bug has been addressed and no longer present.\n\n+ Tower issues seem to be fixed and the ability to "lock" your animals is now present.\n\n+/- Most skills are in the game, still no magic though.\n\n- The company still ignores the English speaking users on the forums and support tickets, which is a major major issue as there are...or were a lot more active English players than any other languages.\n\n- Players from locations that are far from the servers with high pings still are glitchy as hell in combat situations.  This makes them very hard to connect an attack on them.  Kind of a game breaking issue, seeing that there is a lot of PvP in the game when people get their bases built up.\n\n- The server wipes to introduce the new and bigger map did not include character wipes.  Yes, the game does have a slow leveling process, but it gives the game better replay value if you have to earn your levels.  Granted, there are those who have earned their levels by grinding before, but this is a game in development and wipes happen in developing ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes.  A lot of the people interested in buying this game at this current stage are going to be met with a lot of PvP trolls with decked out gear and decent sized groups that will not take in new players who just purchased the game.  Basically, they will be thrown to the wolves and most will not keep playing for longer than a week, if that because of this decision.\n\n\n\nOriginal Review: May 2015\n\nI hate to do this, but I have to edit my review and change it to a not recommended.  At least in it's current state.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThere are many issues with the game's criminal system, what I call a Karma system, after many games with an open PK system with a punishment. Criminal acts give the player a red name tag and a criminal debuff that runs on a timer based on the act(s) commited and how many times they were commited. During this time players will drop all of their loot on the ground upon being killed by the environment or other players.  The problem lies in that there are ways to work around getting flagged by committing crimes that are flagable by simply only doing up to 3 hits within a 10 second period then back off for a bit and come back to do some more damage.  This has led to a major abuse by many troll-like players in the community and has already pushed a good number of players out within the week the game h as been out.\n\nJust like any game in development, there are bugs in this game.  However, some that are halts progress in the game. Taking damage every second by an unseen force until your death has personally caused me to lose 3 mounts and full bags of loot (because I was red named at the time) 2 times.  While dead you are a ghost and have to wait about 3 mins, or collect soul pieces that may or may not be near, to cut that time by 30 seconds each piece.  Within that time, any animals/tree/stone you were carring, cart yo were pushing, mount you were riding or all your loot (if you were red named at the time of death) is being picked up by random players just strolling along and seeing them just on the ground.\n\nIn addition to the invisible death bug there are bugs in the towers where they do not always attack threats to your base, whether they are undead monsters or red named players.  Because of this bug, your base will never be safe from thefts, because you will always have holes in your walls.  Unless you have a member of your guild online AND standing in your base doing a nightly wall check (every 20 mins real time) a section of your wall will eventually go down and players can just jump in.  Now you can lock your goods inside buildings and personal cabins with personal or guild locks.  However, any animals, carts or mounts are fair game at this time and loss of these can set you back.\n\nIf you are playing on the American or European server there is very poor support for them.  As this company tends to cater to their Asia (Hong Kong based) server. The Asia server will go down for an hour for fixes, and the American and European server can end up going down for 17 hours for the same exact fixes.  When the Asia server goes down, they will quickly post a news update about it within 10 minns.  When the American and European servers go down it will be about 2 hours, if any news update at all about what is going on.\n\nCombat is screwy as heck.  Players are not sync'd together on the server.  You'll see those who are right in front of you and you are swinging your weapon right threw them, but they are taking no damage.  Then you sprint ahead of them about 2 strides ahead of them and keep swinging and you are doing damage to them, watching the numbers popping up over their head...behind you. The PvE threats are not much of a threat either.  You can get them stuck by any building corner, tree, fence, even sapplings on the ground.  Your attack range, as a player, is longer than the npc monsters in the world, even if you are using a dagger and the ogre has longer arms and a huge hammer.\n\n\nThe Good:\n\nDespite me truly hating the over use of the phrase, it is true, "This game has great potential." The skills system is great. The different job specialities are great, much like Life is Feudal (on a MMO standard server where don't have unlimited skill points). The gathering basic resources like rock/stone carvings or logs/firewood is perfect.  The metals/coal farming isn't that great though with the number of people playing the game, but very minor bad point and I don't feel it deserves to be listed above.\n\nGames this compares to (in my opinion/experiences):\nLife is Feudal - pretty much 95% likeness\n7 Days to Die - Environment threats like this game, just no roaming hordes\nAny “survival”/builder game (GRAV, Minecraft, Planet Explorers, StarForge, etc) - having to go gather resources to crafting and building.\nHarvest Moon/Farmville - Farming and feeding animals to gather their animal specific goods.","May 30, 2015","false","211.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","3"

Also the art style for this game is very good. The only problem I have with this game is it is terribly optimized.\n\nI have a 970 and I can run GTA 5 on high 60 fps. Yet, I can't even run this game with all the lowest settings without 40-50 fps. Sadly it's just too laggy, I am constantly stuttering in game with low fps and I have found a lot of discussions about a fix for this problem. The thing is there is no fix. Many, many people are having this problem. I would suggest you buy this game if it looks good to you, but if you're stuttering and getting low fps. You either have to wait until they make this game playable, or refund it.\n\nOut of the discussions I have seen about low fps on this game. People with 970's, 980's, 270x's, 280x's are having this problem. I haven't seen many people say they get low fps with a graphics card that is worse than any of those graphics cards.

Everywhere you look, there are unfinished eye sore settlements. If you find somewhere in an area they just release, it's only a matter of a day or two until you log in and you are literally surrounded by people's random buildings. Criminal system is bugged, targeting for the entire game is god awful. Huge imbalances in PvP. The community is ♥♥♥♥ too, much like Albion Online. It seems to be a recent trend with modern sandboxes that the player base is made up of illiterate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ millenial ♥♥♥♥boys. If you are not in a guild the game is literally impossible to play and make any sort of advancement, because you will always be getting ganked. Also, the developers are incapable of speaking anything but Korean and broken English. The game itself is very unprofessional and not in a funny cute way.

Having a real city to do transaction is also not a bad idea.\nAnyway good job Devs, i hope a lot more improvements come along.

Currently in beta so it has many bugs and various issues but also some MAJOR issues which I will get in to.\n\nIn Tree of Life's current state there is much to improve on but there is still a lot of content there for everyone to enjoy so if you do wish to play Tree of Life in its beta state then please remember it is not the full game but you will have a good time depending on your neighbours.\n\nGame play:\n\nTree of Life contains 25 skills that you can progress in which you can max only 8 so if you wish to become a fighter or builder then you can do so and ignore the skills you do not wish to progress in. However, there are some skills which you may not wish to progress in but you will be forced to level in e.g. If you want to create a weapon but that weapon requires an item that only a Tinkerer can create.\n\nPvE:\nThere is a small amount of PvE but I think they are starting to focus on more of this. The basics are there but it is VERY basic. They have some "plans" in the making apparently, such as dungeons. But this has not been revealed exactly so who knows what they will be adding.\n\nPvP:\nThere is much PvP which can be good or bad. PvP is extremely unbalanced as you can grief players by building all around their base and nothing can be done about it. The game punishes you If you try to prevent a griefer by turning you hostile rather than the griefer.\n\nGrind:\nThis game is one of the biggest grinds I have seen in any game! The map is 4x bigger but you may have to travel for about 30mins to reach a special type of tree but as you reach your destination, there are none around as it has been farmed. You will be running back and forth for hours on end.\n\nWood Cutting Simulator:\nBecause there is a huge grind and that most items need wood, you will be cutting trees all day everyday! It is painfully slow and boring to cut wood and sometimes you may not even get any wood from a tree. I dint mind a small grind but the woodcutting is ridiculous!\n\nIn-Game Shop:\nThere is a shop where you can spend real money of items. This is fine and so far they are just bags with more slots and a mount. The only problem is the price. The prices for these items are extremely expensive. A mount costs £15.41 and the game costs £14.99!! Not only that but that mount is apparently 10% off!\n\nSome Concerns:\nI have around 100 hours into this game so far, made lots of friends (and enemies) and found a very friendly and active guild where we have spent a very long time improving our base and skills. I am having lots of fun but do get very frustrated with what has been updated in the game.\n\nNow we have had a map wipe on 18/04/16 which is perfectly fine as it let us start from scratch, we were told the map would be 4x bigger (woohoo!), better graphics and more items etc have been added. Fantastic right? Wrong! 4x bigger is correct but they have hidden over half of the map! Covered it with thick fog not allowing us to see a thing and not allowing us to build in these areas! We were not told this before the map wipe so we had to suffer in silence.\n\nCommunication seems to be the biggest concern for me. There is some on the forum but if you dont sign up there then you will not be able to get as many updates. I know this is the beta but i feel like we have all been taken for a ride than we never wanted.\n\nPros:\nGreat graphics (it's not everyones cup of tea).\nMany skills to choose from and level.\nHuge map.\nPVP/PVE (You don't have to PVP but prepare for it).\nCriminal System (Not developed very well).\nBounty System (Not developed very well).\nFriendly developers (When they actually communicate).\nFeels different from other survival/sandbox games.\nMonster villages which will attack player bases.\nJust the right amount of challenge.\n\nCons:\nPunishment for friendly players\nThick fog not allowing players to see/build half of the map.\nCommunication is very poor.\nBugs (It is Beta!).\nVery little player customisation.\nIf your base is close to a raiding guild then prepare to log in every day to a raided base.\nNo fast travel on such a large map.\nReal money in game shop is very expensive! For a bag it costs nearly as much as the actual game!\n\nVERDICT:\nDO NOT BUY IN CURRENT STATE!\nIn the games current state I would say wait a few more months. I hope they listen to our concerns because this game is not even in a beta stage in my opinion. They labeled it beta to get a flood of new customers and the game needs a hell of a lot more added to it. The only thing that keeps me playing Tree of Life is my guild members. We have put so much time into it that we do not want to put it to waste.","April 1","false","176.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

When I first arrived on the beach I encountered several newcomers and we started to build there some protections agains mobs. Was quite collaborative but soon enought we discoverd the starting location has too less ressources so we have deceided to move more inland.\n\nWe found a great spot there and started to build a small community. Late night we went to sleep then on the morning our place was empty. Someone just destoyed everything. We deceided to spend some more hours to reconstruct but then a gang of 3 russians came and started to destroy everything again. We tried to attack them but have been marked as criminal and they just killed us again and again to loot all our stuff even if we outnumbered them. They just got higher stuff so took no damage from us.\n\nWe deceidfed to move and spent 30min walk to find out another spot but again russians came and the same story happened.\n\nSeems familiar to you ? It's because you probably got the same situation eitrher with Russians or Koreans.\n\nSo this game is fun but those guys ruin it.\n\nI don't recommand it till either the devs do something (remove or balance lockpicking), create region restricted servers to  have no russian and no korean ruining the fun or allow private servers. Another option would be to have PVP/PVE servers/Zones or whatever they implement to have me come back.","June 2","false","14.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It’s a cartoony version of eve online.  The only reason why there are so many positive reviews is because the game developers bribed the players with free DLC packs if they wrote one for them.\n\nI have now played this game for 2 days now.  In that time people have spawn camp killed me relentlessly, smashed up all my stuff, chased me down and stolen all my supplies.  I was even threatened by some jerk that they would endlessly harass me unless I paid them to stop.\n\nI reported these people to the game developers and they don’t seem to care that people are griefing and harassing new players.  I barely had the basic crafting system down before I was being bombarded by people who have nothing better to do then to kill other players.  It was said in the forums that if you don’t like getting killed then join a guild or gain levels and kill them back. So I joined a guild it was a small group and while they were offline SLEEPING and I was in my base crafting stuff I continuously got raided by griefers who would kill my animals, steal my crops and smash up all my buildings.  As I am attempting to get away from these people and not die from the monster NPC’s who are wearing armor while I’m wearing nothing but starter clothes I still tried to level up my skills to get stronger to defend myself.  But in this game if you don’t constantly eat some kind of food you die very quickly.  I couldn't even gather enough supplies to not starve. They killed me so much and harassed me so frequently I wasn’t able to level very quickly, thus prolonging the frustrating endless harassment.\n\nThis game was a complete waste of my money and I regret ever hearing about it.\n\nSo if you love to spend you’re waking existence bringing others down and making them miserable until they no longer want to play the game then this is a great game for you.  For everyone else who just wants to have fun just know that I warned you.  If you buy the game anyway and became enraged by the countless hours lost to jerks who want nothing more than to make you suffer just remember that I did warn you.","June 5, 2015","false","23.4"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","13","27","2","0"

Anyways...\n\nTree of Life is kind of fun, in the same way that Rust or other sociopathic sandboxes are. The major problem is the shortage of land between the three servers (America, EU, and Asia). Most if not all good land is taken. If you find a spot, it is probably for good reason: monster spawns that will destroy your stuff; it's near a raiding guild; the invisible grid for structure placement is awkward (such as in tight valleys or tops of mountains).\n\nWhile the map is huge, I kid you not, you can't go anywhere without seeing a giant walled fortress or someone's abandoned settlement (most likely because they played, logged off, and moved on to another game). With the travel time increasing the frustration of staking out your own claim, you will soon realize that this game is not what it's cracked up to be.\n\nCrafting is not so bad, but the truth is that for each major skill specialization, there's a structure for that, probably a building. Okay, how big? 4x4 square area. When you start to realize that you need multiple buildings to advance, you quickly realize this is not meant to be a solo venture like Minecraft or Rust. Everything takes a LOT of room. I have seen entire fortresses belonging to one person. I would prefer crafting benches instead of buildings (because let's face it, you don't need an entire building to sew something together or cut some wood into lumber).\n\nOther issues like red players (those that have killed other players, stolen, or griefed structures) are not your biggest problem unless they are raiding you. A lot will complain, but honestly I haven't encountered too many and was able to run from all of them. There reportedly is a hacker on the EU server, but only report so far.\n\nPROS:\n+ Fun to build your own fortress\n+ Crafting recipes themselves aren't too bad\n+ Mobs are pretty easy and food is super easy to find (punch trees for apples, cook them in a fire)\n+ If you liked punching trees in Minecraft, you're gonna have a blast\n\nCONS:\n- There is not a lot of room to build considering the player count vs map size\n- Many abandoned and/or raided settlements consume valuable real estate\n- The crafting system relies heavily on large stationary structures\n- Red players (as it stands as of the write of this review) can become a large problem if you live too close to them\n- The graphics are sub-par and character models look like they were whipped up in a matter of minutes\n- The day/night cycle is not well balanced (days and nights are about the same, feels like spring/fall equinox)\n\nRating (as of today): 5/10\n\nTL;DR: If you are looking to get this game, just be forewarned: it is Early Access, so you can only expect so much. It has a lot of potential, but still has a long way to go before it can compete with other sandbox MMOs. As it stands, I can't recommend it.","June 16, 2015","false","18.2"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","0"

But you can't, you have a point limit which only allows you to max 8 skills.\nWhat most new players do, and should do, is increase their carpenter and thinkering level, that will allow them to make new buildings, buildings which they will need to survive.\n\nThe point of the game isn't playing alone, otherwise it will be very hard to defend yourself against high lvl players.\nThis is a game made for teamplay, every skill that makes items (sewing, blacksmithing, cooking, etc) needs items from the other skills and, like I said before, there is no way to max them all so you will need to either make a "village" with more players or buy the items you need from them.\n\nThe bad part of this game is that it is in fact in Early Access, when the game launched there was an insane amount of players and the dev's weren't expecting that amount of players so the map was too small for them all, since most of those players stopped playing waiting for the dev's to update the map you will see a lot of abandoned buildings lying around.\n\nLong story short, this game is amazing!\nIt managed to do what other survival games tried.\nYou want to build a town, you build a town.\nYou want to hunt animals and slaughter every single person you see, you kill animals and try to slaughter every single person you see... you might die x)\nIn this version of the game you can do "almost" anything you want.\n","August 19, 2015","true","95.1"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

I ran around the entire map looking for someplace that wasnt crowded.  Didn'd find anyplace.  The whole map is utterly covered in player structures.  Not to mention half of the map is a "Misty Zone" meaning you can't build there let alone see very well.  If you do decide to build something "Beware" other players will run up and steal anything they can get there hands on.  In order to craft something you have to place building mats into work benches of various types, and if you step away for a minute to get more materials other player's will run up and steal the mats off of the bench.  You can make storage structures (Survival tent, hut) that you have to build padlocks for to lock. but that doesnt help either since other players just run up smash the lock and steal the stuff inside. or the higher skilled players just create lockpicks and pick the lock on your storage.  Even the Wild Zaka Mount that you can purchase in game can be stolen from you.  All a player has to do is run up to it "Use it" and off they go.\n\nIf you like to steal stuff from other players this is the game for you.

Good 3D model, AI and the the building work for the game. And a good server that wont lag that having around 600 to 8000 people playing together in the game at the same time.\n\nBut there are a few things that need to improve in game. The in game input a lot of things inside even that have a statistic the skill points with 400 of it. The states are great but how come a test server wont open all things public as to help you improve the game and share the game to others with a better quality in it?Just like the state have INT that still not open to us, the dodging system in game as the DEX said in it.\n\nSecond is that the meaning of that game you or your company want. Your games presented as a sandbox to build a castle and then that is done for it? The environment only have little amount of things that can share, so you mean that we need to PvP in it? or it is a PvP sandbox that we need to fight for a seed or the bull? Can it have a peaceful server that can have no achievement inside and just free of us to explore the game like minecraft or terriera?\n\nThird the building system, it is ok for just build a square of wall and we need to waste tons of times on it as to defend our home. But I dont think that I will be " RED" name because I hurt a unknown person in my city that stealing and kill my animals in my city.

Control is wonky, engine is badly optimized. End game... what end game? Combat sucks, moving sucks, crafting... well, my experience is that people generally are satsified with "hit this" "now press this button" "now you have stuffs" "place it on the ground" "admire for a few minutes" "now hit more stuff" "press more buttons" as evidenced by the abundance of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games with positive overall reviews with reviews like "craftings good i guess oh some 12 y.o. hit me with a horribly desynced spear while yelling miley cyrus 10 out of 10 would buy again."\n\nLike so many games of this ilk, you log in and for a brief moment you think about the possibilities of the game mechanics on paper. Then you play the game for 5 minutes and then realize that you've already hit the peak of what this game has to offer. Because games aren't just cute graphics and interesting ideas. Games are things you play.

With it comes the usual crappy client issues like unexplained fps drops, screen tearing, client crashes, but that's the least of your worries.\n\nI really wanted to like the game, but I'm afraid it's very dull, featureless, boring, repetative, flawed and most importantly - time consuming.\n\nLet's start with the major flaws:\nThere is no party chat or global chat or guild chat. Wait! There is no party in the game. The sole guild feature in the game is that you can use your guild members' buildings if they put a guild lock on it. So where are your friends in the world? Ask them on Skype or Teamspeak, cuz there is no other way to find out. So for an online game, it's amazing how antisocial this game is, and how hard it is to play with others. And make no mistake. This is NOT a game you can solo, unless you play like 70 hours for the first 4-5 days, and at least 3 hours every day after that.\n\nNight and day follow each other in quick succession. Night time is so dark, that you literally can't see anything. I'm not joking. It's pitch black. Seriously. Black. This means that you either spend LOTS of resources on lightning (which is very dumb) or you limit yourself to tasks that don't require moving or seeing (standing 10 minutes crafting, harvesting lumber or stone). If you try to do anything else then you'll be GREATLY penalized.\n\nTraveling is superslow, superboring, superblehI'lljustaltf4.\nBut you'll need to travel, because certain resources like "lava sculpture" (red ore) or corn or whatever is not found in your home biome. Let me translate:\nYou want to get lava? Push WWWWW for 10 minutes. Look at a completely black screen (night) for 10 minutes. Do some mining, then head back and push the same boring WWWWW for 20 minutes, and stare at a completely black screen for 10 minutes. As there is no fast travel.\n\nIt took us about 80 manhours to build a base that can put up a small defense. Which means it has 1 of each type of buildings, 6 storage buildings, a wooden wall, and about 14 mark2 towers.\n80.\nHours.\nWithout a base you can't do anything, cuz crafting is dependent on crafting buildings, and storage space, so no fort = no buildings = no anything.\nEach night (every 10 minutes) zombies and skeletons will spawn and chip away at your walls. It takes about 5-10 minutes for 1 of these creatures to chip away at your walls. A tower kills them in about 10-15 arrows. Our base has to fend off about 4 mobs each night. So 15arrowpermob * 4mobpernight * 72 nights a day means you'll need about 4300 arrows a day. Those will have to be crafted by a carpenter. Someone will have to collect those mats. 20 arrow = 1 copper 1 lumber 1 feather. So you'll have to craft this recipe about 200 times a day. Just crafting all that ♥♥♥♥ requires you to sit at the crafting bench for 20 minutes, and crafting the lumber will take about 10 additional minutes, and that's the easy part! You have to collect these resources first, and that will take at least 2 manhours. You also need to repair the damaged buildings with coins. Certain monsters drop coins, and it will take about 10 minutes of beating up kobolds and skeletons and ♥♥♥♥ to have enough to fix your buildings.\n\nSo all in all, your completely minimalistic base spends about 3 hours a day just to defend itself from monsters at night with a high success rate.\nAnd that's only if RNGesus didn't spawn the monsters in an uneven way.\nAnd that's only if players didn't grief you. We were griefed every few hours. And you will be too! We went for a 20 minute break on the first day. Base got destroyed. We went to sleep on the first day. Half the base was destroyed. We went to sleep on the 2nd day. All our buildings were lockpicked. The arrows were stolen from our towers, so much of what the players didn't take or destroy was destroyed by monsters entering the disarmed base.\nBut the best thing is:\nIf you don't repair the base each day. Don't restock your arrows every 24 hours then your base will be leveled in 1 day, and you'll lose the time put into your lost items and buildings.\n\nLet me rephrase that:\nTHERE IS NO POINT IN PLAYING THIS GAME, UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING TO SPEND AT LEAST THREE HOURS A DAY ON JUST FORT MAINTENANCE.\n\nAnd even if you do. Some player might just decide to destroy your whole base for fun. He can do that naked with his fists if he wants to.\n\nBut why would you want to play this game? It has virtually nothing to offer besides building a base and crafting.\n\nCombat is really annoying and boring. Targeting is hard. You'll often end up hitting your buddy instead of the monster you are trying to hit. Trying to hit moving enemy players is hard, and not fun. There are no combat skills. So combat is basically clicking left button over and over again.\nFighting monsters is boring. There aren't many of them either. Again: you are just spamming 1 button the whole fight.\nThe world is dull too. Lack of landmarks or scenery or points of interest or variety.\n\nPvP is pretty much nonexistent except for griefing. You know why? Cuz it's boring, tedius, not rewarding, pointless.\n\nOh wait. There IS PvP in the game! In the form of griefing. This game is a griefers paradise. Through a long array of game design flaws and exploits people will destroy your base, and get away unpunished.\nYour weakass useless defense towers don't attack if they grief in certain ways:\n-They can harvest your crops\n-They can kill your animals\n-They can destroy your farmlands\n-They can destroy your workbenches, fire pits, planning tables, cooking tables and a few other things.\nWhen they destroy other buildings or kill you they will become "red" for a few minutes, and your towers will attack them, but it's so supereasy to tank/bandage towers and lockpick them and take out your arrows, or just facetank the arrows until they are depleted and the towers will stop firing.\nLong story short, anyone can EASILY break into your base if they want to grief you. We played for 4 days, and we encountered griefers every few hours. I estimate that about 10-15% of our time was spent on gathering resources that the griefers destroyed or took.\n\n\nI could go on for a long while about how...\nThe game was probably literally translated by Google translate. I'm not even joking.\nPair this with the fact that item decriptions are pretty bad or miswired (Egg says it's rotten meat, and so on).\nCharacter costumization doesn't exist.\n... and so on, but just save yourself from this game.\n\n\nWe scouted the surrounding areas, and about 95% of all bases on the world are abandoned wrecks, so, like us, most players get annoyed by the dull and frustrating game experience and just leave.","June 16, 2015","false","53.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

Control is wonky, engine is badly optimized. End game... what end game? Combat sucks, moving sucks, crafting... well, my experience is that people generally are satsified with "hit this" "now press this button" "now you have stuffs" "place it on the ground" "admire for a few minutes" "now hit more stuff" "press more buttons" as evidenced by the abundance of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games with positive overall reviews with reviews like "craftings good i guess oh some 12 y.o. hit me with a horribly desynced spear while yelling miley cyrus 10 out of 10 would buy again."\n\nLike so many games of this ilk, you log in and for a brief moment you think about the possibilities of the game mechanics on paper. Then you play the game for 5 minutes and then realize that you've already hit the peak of what this game has to offer. Because games aren't just cute graphics and interesting ideas. Games are things you play. And this game does not play well.\n\nIf you have a few friends and you like the idea of playing a game with gathering and crafting then you'll likely get some enjoyment out of it, especially if you're looking for a cutesy aesthetic as opposed to the ugly generic psuedo-realism of popular "sandbox survival" games.\n\nIf the actual act of playing the game (i.e. controlling your character, moving about the world, engaging in combat, etc.) is important to you then save your time and money.","June 23, 2015","false","0.8"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

Well that is until the trolls and griefers came around. I was even willing to forgive the crazyt fast day/night cycle and the pitch black nights(cant see anything). They need more servers. The american server is wayyyyyy overpopulated. This overpopulation means loads of trolls. Had 2 guys needlessly grief me. They filled up my entire base with unbuilt walls and destroyed all of my buildings. Thing is there is absolutely no way to combat this either.\n\nWalls do not actually keep anyone out of your base. The walls are essentially pointless. While you can build defenses, for example, an arrow tower it takes so many arrows to keep it going and you have to supply them. They also will only shoot red characters and mobs. There are so many mobs at night that your arrows disappear in minutes.\n\nI did enjoy all the different biomes and i loved the animals. Only thing about animals is you cannot claim any as your own really. You are supposed to be able to breed them but that will never happen cause someone will kill them before you could even attempt to do it.\n\nMostly the game was just ruined for me by the griefers and trolls. They need to implement some sort of system where you can claim land or build walls that can actually keep people out. If you buy this game do not get attached to anything you build or any resources you gather cause they will get stolen or destroyed.\n\nI will change my review if they actually implement more servers and a way to combat griefers and trolls because i thuroughly enjoyed the game itself.","June 5, 2015","false","23.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I don’t see myself getting bored any time soon. It’s like the Harvest Moon online that I always dreamed of. Between farming, fishing, building, lockpicking, crafting, levelling, always being in need of resources, and always needing to find food to eat, I find my attention pulled constantly in different directions, and always having 10 things on my list that I need to get done as I build my base and level my character. To me, that’s the mark of a well-thought out game. Plus the stealing, plundering, and pvp elements of the game add an element of danger that motivates you to keep on fortifying those walls and securing your base.\n\nWith the latest patch, many pvp’ers are complaining that the game punishes them too severely (by instituting skill loss depending on your criminal level), but I personally think the developers have done a nice job of allowing pvp and theft while yet keeping the game from being an endless griefer fest.\n\nIf you’re looking for a hardcore pvp game, this probably isn’t it (just look at the visuals!). This is more of a grindy survival sandbox. I’d compare it to the old Runescape, but without quests and with more survival elements. Some people have said the game is not solo friendly, but I have been playing solo and am doing just fine so far.

It's truly a good game already, but is quite buggy at times and a couple things need to be over-worked. First and fore-most the Criminal System needs a huge overhaul, the Devs just released a statement saying they will be looking for ways to fix this, as well as making your base more defensable when you are logged out so if you cant play for two days you wont come back to complete rubble. Combat I think needs a tune-up as well, it's all fine and well for PvE combat currently, but the PvP is a little bit silly with the targeting being so shotty. But if you play the game just for what it is, it Is actually very very good, just give it a try (especially if you have friends) and you will soon see why it's worth your money. I do understand that certain areas and regions have grifers and a lot of people are mad, my advice is just be patient, if the area you are in is far too hostile, Move!..

The level up system is unique but its hard to level up. This is because all the higher level people that have managed to get that high do nuthing but pick on the lower level people. This is a big issue  on the game in my opinion because it gives people that instant negitive feel torwords the game when really besides the fact its a good game. The devs do need to rethink the punishment system because it seams backwords. How you get red name for killing people with yellow names that attack you and your base. Thats like getting arested for beating someone up that tryed to kill you and blew up your house it just doesnt make sence.

Ill put this out there so everyone has a clear understanding that you gain next to nothing by PvPing.. yet lose everything. if someone attacks and kills you, you will drop one random item from your bag.. then if you kill them (as they would now be red) they will not only drop your random stack of twigs but also their armour, weapons, food and whatever else they had. Due to this the only time you see people attacking other people is in the rookie starting locations as people dont know what to do, attack eachother and then complain about the game being pvp..\n\nThe game is 99% focused PvE with great communities forming all accross the map. if a single one of these negative commenters took a walk accross the vast and plentifull biomes they would see huge thriving kingdoms and economies. They would encounter players travelling to sell their ore in other areas, in which it lacks, for profit. They would see that it is neer impossible to actually attack another player without dieing from the other arrow towers nearby.\n\nThis game is absolutely huge and it is only early access. I have currently played over 40 hours in this game and i am still yet to get even close to the crafting peak. i have built my own fort and armed it with defence, yet i still have noob gear as i wanted to focus in crafting.. this shows that you dont need epic gear to win. you dont need a huge guild backing.. you simply need to think of what you want to do and do it.\n\nas for the others still in the rookie area attacking one another.. good luck with that,","June 11, 2015","true","102.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It is a very big map, the only downfall is that about 50-60% of it is too foggy to see 5 feet in front of you. Also every 10 feet there are hostiles that attack you and with little resources at the start and trying to do it solo will make it a hard time, as well as the toxic campers that kill fresh spawns. Virtually every spot along the shoreline and even most further away from the shore is inhabitted due to overpopulation. Hunger fades way too quickly and some of the resources you need are hours away depending on your location and what you need. The in-game "auction house" isn't very helpful, it just tells you where to buy things from certain people. They need to split the game into 2 or 3 servers, or at the very least make it so that the mist is gone for good so players can inhabit the space, maybe a few added in resources that aren't going to take 3 in-game days to recover. Upon death you lose 1 random item in your bags, and I died a total of 4-6 times trying to reach an area that I could establish a base, due to running into mob after mob after mob... and most of them run as fast or faster than you do, so you're pretty much dead. Overall, I like the game, but as is, it's lacking hardcore. Also the mount isn't worth the money, it gives you a 20% speed boost and the chore of feeding the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as often as you feed yourself, if you're going to make it that difficult to maintain then I suggest converting the mount into a two-person carriage with resource carrying abilities, because the mount costs more than the game yet provides minimal ♥♥♥♥ to help, it's actually a pain cause now I have 2 mouths to feed...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TYPatron/recommended/361800/","TYPatron","Patron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TYPatron/","198 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI read reviews before purchasing the game and then read reviews after purchasing the game. The reason my review is so long is because I want people to get excited about this excellent game so that the devs recieve more support and (hopefully) respond accordingly with more work and content. Also FYI I bought the DLC it wasn't given to me, this game is just good.\n\nHaving said that:\n\nThis game is like Runescape meets Life is Feudal, then this game has its own special flare which I enjoy very much.\n\nReasons its like Runescape:\nGraphics\nTalent Progression\n\nReason its like Life is Feudal:\nBuilding\nCrafting\n\nWhat stands out,\n\nPlayer Consequence system:\nWhat this does is when a player steals, breaks, or attacks other people and their things he or she is marked a criminal. This changes their name to appear red and if they are killed everything they carry drops.\n\nCombat:\nSoft Targeting means you hold down the attack after looking at a target. You then lock on automatically with your first attack and then can move around and look around while still attacking (as long as you stay near the target).\n***This is not true with projectile weapons.\n\nBeing an outlaw:\nIn this game you truly can do whatever you want. I played as an outlaw for a little while and something I really appreciated was how when I went to steal something five things happened\n1. My lockpick was used up\n2. A "Trace of Evil" appeared on the ground to let the players know a crime was commited at that very spot\n3. I was only allowed to steal one item\n4. There was a timer for when anyone could steal another item giving the victim time to reinforce and protect his valuables.\n5. My name turned red for everyone to see and I was at risk of being hunted down and killed for my crime.\n\nBuilding destruction:\nYou can repair your destroyed buildings but you have to be an active player to ensure it says protected otherwise your city will turn to ruins and your neglect will show. What this does is makes sure you are playing the game and if you arent gives other players the opportunity to build something where your city will eventually crumble.\n\nLastly, The different playstyles:\nYou can be a Builder, Bruiser, Tinker, Blacksmith, Archer, Supplier, Shopkeeper, Outlaw, Guild Leader, etc. These things will garuntee to fill you time up. You can play a vital role in peoples experience and if you decide you want to change all it will take is supply and time. You can easily go from a Blacksmith to a Tinker and still retain all your Blacksmith ability.\n\nTruly a beautiful thing the devs should be proud of.\n\nPros:\nGraphics are relaxing in a Runescape type of way\nConsequence system\nTheft system\nA true "Play it your own way" game\nCommunity is fantastic\nMap is HUGE and diverse\nYou can make shops and sell things!\nActive Developers (It is sad that this needs to be mentioned... What has gaming come to?)\n\nCons:\nEarly Access (You know that upon purchase so this con isn't very justifiable)\nGrind-y (A pro for some and a con for others)\nDifficult to get started (FInd people to work with before going on your own!)\nHas a Lame beginning (Until you know what you are doing you are bored out of your mind. Play for at least 5 hours)\n\nI have noticed that a lot of the cons people post are a consequence of early production which people should not be surprised by when buying a game that is not completed yet. A lot of other cons are just mechanics of the game which are easily countered through mechanics that the devs purposely created such as "Enemies spawning in base" easily countered by Arrow Towers which you can create early on.\n\nMy reccomendation if you get the game is to play with other players until you get a good feeling of what to do and how to do it. WARNING! This game will seem lame intially because there is so much to do you don't know WHAT to do.\n\nLevel Carpentry first. Level Farming second. Level Tinkering third. Everything else will either happen along the way or you will know enough about what you are doing to figure it out yourself.\n\nMy reccomendation if you DONT get the game is to follow it and keep up. Make sure the developers stay active and the content keeps getting polished and pushed out into release.","June 10, 2015","true","242.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You can be a mercenary / bounty hunter, working for coin or gear and delivering proof of a targets death via screenshot and the steam forums to the client upon assasination.\n\nYou can be a blacksmith and forge weapons and metal armor.\nA tailor making cloth and leather gear.\nA carpenter, building walls, buildings and even things like mailboxes (not implemented yet)\n\nA word of advice however. there is no global or trade/auction chat. This is a more or less medieval world where news is by word of mouth from people you meet and trade with as you travel. It is a savage dangerous world where having allies and friends means life or death. You're welcome to travel alone,but know that you may be attacked and killed at any time by roaming player bandits who sometimes even travel in packs. If you have good gear you might win a fight, but in a group you will always be safer.\n\nIt is a harsh world where, if you don't carry food to eat you will slow to a weak walk and become an easy target because you can't run.\n\nThere is next to no tutorial at all. You make a character and you are dropped off at the beach of the island in a location you choose. Players are generally very nice and helpful if you have questions, but you will encounter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who prey on travelers and will no doubt demand your money or your life.\n\nOne more thing (sorry for the long post) If you think you can build an entire castle and every building you can by yourself, you can, but it will fall to ruin every time because you're just one person trying to keep up with task of maintaining an entire town meant for roughly 15-20 people to perform the work it needs to stay alive.\n\nOh yeah, reputation spreads fast as fire. If you live the life of a theif or bandit, the server will know through the steam forums and you will become hunted.

With that said, I think they have a great thing going here. It does take some great things from other games but they have made it unique on it's own merit.\n\nTree of life is great for people who like a steady progression/rpg/adventure/build game :) The only troubles the game seems to have are the penalty system for players who choose to steal, vandalize, and kill property and othe players. Most of the other complaints are simply out of ignorance of how the game works....things like towers not being worth a damn because people can steal the arrows out of them - You can place locks (actually pad locks) on everything you own to keep people from stealing. Of course there is lockpicking in game which comes with a price :).\n\nFiguring out the game and getting together with friends to build a town and grow your character is amazingly fun and it actually encourages you to make friends quickly. Soloing is a bit tough but i've seen some manage it (but for how long?)\n\nThis game is highly addicting in that you always want the next thing, what's over the next hill, what can i do to get more people to join my town? All these things make the game delightfully engaging and it's not even done yet!\n\n","June 9, 2015","true","41.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Nothing could be further from the truth though. Tree of Life, a sandbox survival mmo, has pvp as an optionable game feature, like most of the other games it is compared too. However, it does not suffer from pvp being an over-centralized playstyle due to a criminal system. What this means is killing on sight isn't and won't be a normal for how the community behaves in game. Which was a huge problem for games of similar ilk. With that said, let the review begin!\n\nTHE REVIEW\n\nTree of Life is like most of the bandwagon crafting survival games out there on Steam. At least, at it's core it is. So, why would I recommend it? While it isn't very original, what it does, it does right. And by that I mean you really get the feeling this game was made by developers who are also gamers at heart. You'll start on an island, your starting position determined by which boat you picked when creating your character. At which point you will adventure into this huge island prospecting the area. You may eventually find a place to call your own, or a group of people looking for another member to strengthen their group.\n\nThat brings up the community portion of the game. It's quite hard to survive on your own. You'll need to invest more time into the game then a group would, and you'll need to level all of your skills, where as groups can have people who specialize in certain skills. In that sense, the game is quite hard if you demand to play lone wolf. But, it's also very rewarding once you make it on your own.\n\nThe way levelings work in this game is quite brilliant. I've heard many say it's similar to Ultima Online.  Rather than levels persay, you have masteries. Skills basically. These level up and give you stats based on what type of skill they are. The system isn't entirely perfect. While skills level up, most attack skills don't seem to do anything at a higher level beyond just giving out those base stats. Crafting related skills are essential to unlocking new recipes. What this means is attack skills have little going for them right now.\n\nSome skills are way harder then others to level. While that's fine for something like Blacksmithing, it doesn't really feel deserved on a skill like archery. On the flip side, some skills are too easy to level. Farming is a great example of that. But, the system has lots of promise. There is also a cap. This cap exists to let someone dabble into all of the said skills, but only master 8 or so of them. This helps prevent people from grinding to a point of god hood. The cap works wonders in that regard. Want to try fishing out? You can. Don't like it, try something else out. It doesn't force you down one road, but grants customization to make your experience more unique.\n\nThis is an early access game. And like most of them, it can be buggy, have it's exploits, and it's balancing issues. The reason this isn't a deal breaker though is because of the developers and their decisive action. Is there a game breaking bug surrounding the criminal system? Yes. What do the developers do? Work on fixing it immediately, and give the people a warning that any future abuse of exploits can result in a permanent ban from the game. They tried their hardest to stop the problem, and they stopped it in it's tracks before it did any more damage. Griefing in ways the criminal system does not cover is also another issue, one they are already hard at work fixing, if they haven't fixed it already with a patch I just finished downloading. It's hard to rag on the game for any one particular issue like some other reviews are doing out there, because the issue will most likely be dealt with in a day or a few at most.","June 9, 2015","true","160.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Eats a lot of CPU for a 700mb game. Framedrops possible on low-end PCs and laptops. Some problems with you trying to hit a monster and he is waaaay over there, but you see him right infront of you.\n\nSolo this game is probably meh, but with friends..You are desperately baking apples to eat atleast something, when your friend almost beats you to death because you have some rope. He gets the rope and 3 minutes later crawls back from the darkness with a majestic Tuna on his shoulder, screaming "I MADE IT, WE HAZ FOOD". Then he drops it, you and your other friends look at it and then you start beating the sh*t out of it screaming "For the Glory of Satan!" with sticks, barehands and a fishing rod.\n\nYeah, I recommend it.","June 8, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I absolutely love it. Being this is my first review of a game, I'll do the common "pros and cons" list.\n\nPros;\n- Do anything you want. Explore, hunt, fish, cook, be a tailor, build your base, fight mobs, whatever you want.\n- So many things going on for being early access\n- Community is fairly nice and helpful to new players\n- Drives players to work together rather than kill each other\n- PvP system is well balanced; Players names will turn red if they randomly kill someone or steal a players items, and if you die in the red, you drop your whole inventory\n- Clothing and armor/weapons options to further customize your character\n- Symplistic MMO controls.\n- Decent art style\n\nCONS;\n- I HATE the unbalanced day/night cycle. It feels like daytime is too short, and night time is too long. Night can be absolutely trecherous for a new player, until you can handle the mobs.\n- The destruction system; if you are logged out for more than 2 days, your base demolishes itself. You have to collect bronze coins from mobs to repair the buildings. (this is both good and bad, as if a player quits the game, their base doesnt just take up space on the map, but I feel it happens too quickly.)\n- It feels impossible to find a place to start a solid base. There are massive bases in EVERY good spot, and by the time you'd catch up, you're out of room to build because 5 more bases pop up around you. This is caused by too many players on 1 map, and everyone building a distance apart. Essentially, the map feels consumed.\n\nOverall, I feel the cons can be tweaked by the devs throughout time, and this game would be perfect. I'd highly recommend it to fans of Ultima Online, Haven and Hearth, Salem, Rust, or any sort of Survival MMOs.\n\n9/10 (positive it will be a 11/10 soon enough)","June 8, 2015","true","31.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I enjoyed the leveling system of skills and stuff. Its not unique to this game alone, but this was the only game with a system like this that had a good review on the game. I did my fair share of reading the reviews on this game as well. Constantly throughout I was worried about the constantly reoccuring things. One, which was the elephant in the room was the over populated servers. It is extremely difficult even finding a place to put a base that was in a good place or even around decent resources. Didnt help that most of them simply were active anymore. Easily could break down the inactive bases and place it with your own, but then you become criminal for it. So it was somethign we had to deal with and put ourselves in a really crappy place.\n\nThe next major thing and the biggest thing of why I am writing this review and why I am basically going to be stopping playing this game. Raiders. People are literally just leveling their lockpicking and then just get by by raiding other peoples hard work. That kind of stuff becomes extremely frustrating and often times, the few times I found people on they were extremely caucious about my presence. And it was with good reason. I even got accused of raiding someones base just because I was resource mining in the area when they got online.  I know, its sorta comes with the terretory with these kinds of games, but there could be so many ways this kind of community could be prevented. I mean come on, the game literally has a skill to build on that specifically works to raid peoples bases. Its just frustrating. It takes next to no effort for one guy just to break into someones base and just steal everything.","January 14","false","39.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Like in WS the graphic style is very unique and cartoonish, with big oogly eyed PCs and cudly NPCs. The crafting system is, like almost all modern sandbox games, a little bit like MC, though there are more crafting and work stations, like shops for example.\nThe mix of WS and MC can also be seen in the (still w.i.p.) world: like WS dense forrest areas change with vast spaces of nothingness with a few NPC monsters sprinkled over the scenery - and like most public MC servers abandond player hpuses and bases are wildly scattered all over.\nAt this moment the gameplay consistis mostly of gathering resources and building your base - nothing else.\nThe combat with monsters is spartanic at best, while PlayerKiller attacks seem to be the main thread.\nMabye this game will become a nice sandbox mmo for casual gamers, and I hope so, because it looks quite nice if you like the toon style - but at this early state the game content is unexciting, limited and neither a challenge nor a fun time for survival gamers.","May 2","false","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Weapon masteries don't seem to do anything but give stats but if you want stats crafting gives the same faster with actual content unlocked. Aggressive field monsters currently can spawn inside your walled off  base and attack your stuff when in range either way while you are offline, though killing monsters will give you coins to repair it easily enough but some small buildings like basic fences and basic crafting stations aren't repairable. Arrows take forever to make and 20 minutes of grinding will probably give your tower enough to kill one enemy while you are logged off but the range is too far and hits enemies not even attacking your stuff.\n\nStats don't seem to be balanced at the moment, STR seems to be the best stat by far giving 1~1 damage per 5 STR with any weapon letting you do nice unarmed damage and not have to deal with the low durability weapons. DEX seems completely useless at the moment giving 1 critical per point which isn't 1% and 1 stamina that doesn't affect regen speed. CON only gives 1 health per point, might scale with stacking inventory space with high quality bandages and having an amazing weapon and armor and INT/magic isn't implemented. Weapons have no differences currently with the same speed and range while giving you an x~x damage boost for 1 durability per hit even on rocks and trees, pretty useless without a high level blacksmith/tinker crafting them for more damage and durability.\n\nCurrently there is no way to tie livestock to you so people can make a building outside of your walls if you don't use stone walls and jump over them to kill them with no penalty. As with above mounts are randomly spawning rarely apparently but they don't log off with you and suffer the same problem as above.\n\nWhen these problems are fixed I would recommend the game but this is just the beginning of Early Access and will be fixed.\n\nEDIT as of 6/4/15:People being able to jump over walls has been fixed by increasing their sizes fixing a lot of issues. They also turned arrows from 10 per craft to 40 and reduced the dumb extra  requirements of above copper fixing monsters at night mostly while making aggressive day monsters not attack buildings. They announced plans of a leash item to tie livestock to you but it isn't implemented yet. I will recommend the game now but be warned if you care about PvP or fighting monsters weapon masteries still don't do anything and magic is still not implemented, rollbacks from server crashes have been frequent.","June 1, 2015","true","50.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The initial impression I got with it was from the visuals and I really hope they improve them to allow the user to ingest such awesome game play and features more easily.\n\nThe game play is the traditional open world, survival, pvp type that is over saturating the market however the way that it's executed begs a look into this diamond in the rough. With traditional RPG elements and profession system, an easy way to summarize this game would be to say it's a miniaturized sandbox MMORPG with a focus on a close-knit commmunity that'll push people to interact given the island environment you play on. That's not to say the island is small since it took me 30-40 minutes of continuous running to reach the opposite side but with the server cap of 1,000 players I imagine it'll feel much smaller.\n\nThe cute soundtrack and graphical representation may give off a false sense of innocence however this game is harsh and challenging. If you decide to go smash a skeleton with your new club on your first night then expect to die. When you do die you'll spawn at the location of your body but as a ghost with a 3 minute respawn time and you can grab souls around the area to take off chunks of the timer.\n\nAll in all I am impressed with what is already here and I can see myself playing it for a long time.

Weapon masteries don't seem to do anything but give stats but if you want stats crafting gives the same faster with actual content unlocked. Aggressive field monsters currently can spawn inside your walled off  base and attack your stuff when in range either way while you are offline, though killing monsters will give you coins to repair it easily enough but some small buildings like basic fences and basic crafting stations aren't repairable. Arrows take forever to make and 20 minutes of grinding will probably give your tower enough to kill one enemy while you are logged off but the range is too far and hits enemies not even attacking your stuff.\n\nStats don't seem to be balanced at the moment, STR seems to be the best stat by far giving 1~1 damage per 5 STR with any weapon letting you do nice unarmed damage and not have to deal with the low durability weapons. DEX seems completely useless at the moment giving 1 critical per point which isn't 1% and 1 stamina that doesn't affect regen speed. CON only gives 1 health per point, might scale with stacking inventory space with high quality bandages and having an amazing weapon and armor and INT/magic isn't implemented. Weapons have no differences currently with the same speed and range while giving you an x~x damage boost for 1 durability per hit even on rocks and trees, pretty useless without a high level blacksmith/tinker crafting them for more damage and durability.\n\nCurrently there is no way to tie livestock to you so people can make a building outside of your walls if you don't use stone walls and jump over them to kill them with no penalty. As with above mounts are randomly spawning rarely apparently but they don't log off with you and suffer the same problem as above.\n\nWhen these problems are fixed I would recommend the game but this is just the beginning of Early Access and will be fixed.\n\nEDIT as of 6/4/15:People being able to jump over walls has been fixed by increasing their sizes fixing a lot of issues. They also turned arrows from 10 per craft to 40 and reduced the dumb extra  requirements of above copper fixing monsters at night mostly while making aggressive day monsters not attack buildings. They announced plans of a leash item to tie livestock to you but it isn't implemented yet. I will recommend the game now but be warned if you care about PvP or fighting monsters weapon masteries still don't do anything and magic is still not implemented, rollbacks from server crashes have been frequent.","June 1, 2015","true","50.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I enjoy it alot though, so I'll give it a thumbs up because I like where the DEVs are headed.

It takes on a cartoony look and is set on a large, multi-biomed island in the middle of an ocean. The progression in the game is centered around leveling, which often requires players to grind by either crafting duplicates of the same item or by attacking resource nodes/monsters.\n\nThis game is in EARLY Alpha build, so keep in mind that any review cannot fully cover the finished product.\n\nCombat (PvP and PvE)\nCombat is extremely lacking in this version of the game. Combat can be summed up in three categories: Auto-Attacking, Bandaging, and Running.\n\nAuto-Attacking\nWhether you are fighting monsters or players, how you deal damage is mostly the same. To fight, all that you must do is move close enough for your target to be highlighted and hold down your left mouse button until they are dead. The weapon you most likely will use to kill will either be a sword or another weapon that requires only one hand. This is because currently, the two-hander skill is broken and two-handed weapons deal the same damage per hit as one-handers but deal it MUCH MUCH slower. If you find yourself favoring marksman or sniper in most of the games you play, you won't be wanting to in Tree of Life. Archery is currently broken (at least that is what it appears to be) and is not a viable weapon to use. Using a mid-tier bow that does about 10-20 damage and using arrows that deal 20-40 damage, your shots will probably do about 12 damage to top tier monsters and about 18 to low tier ones. That sort of damage is about as much as I could deal tickling a hippopotamus and that doesn't even account for the speed of firing a bow and the high energy required to fire. Ontop of that, targeting on the bow is terrible. Instead of accounting for arrow-drop or for calculating distance, you just look at your target until they are highlighted and fire. While this may favor people with low skill (as in actual aiming dexterity and not level sort of skill) it is flawed even there because you can accidently target walls, trees, and structures that your target is standing near, which will make you a target for the neutral arrow towers nearby.\n\nBandaging\nTo get health back quickly in the middle of a fight, bandages are the tool for the job. To use a bandage, simply select it by hitting the correct key in your hotbar and dragging your cursor over to the icon by holding down right click. Once you have used a bandage, there will be a short cooldown before you can use any other healing/food item.\n\nRunning\nTo escape combat or move away quickly, you will need to sprint. Sprinting can be achieved by double tapping the "W" key. Once you start to sprint, you will drain your energy at about 100 per second. Now this is a problem because while you are fighting, you are also using energy to attack, so temporarily retreating to bandage is a costly move when fighting players. Beyond using it for combat, it is mostly useless for moving around because most people can only sprint for around 2-3 seconds before they are out of energy and then must wait for it to slowly recharge.\n\n\nBuilding\nAs was previously mentioned, Tree of Life is most similiar to Archeage, and building is the biggest reason for that. Building can be seperated into three categories as well: Defensive Buildings, Utility Buildings, and Building Construction.\n\nDefensive Buildings\nWalls, gates, fences, and archer towers are all the defensive buildings in this game. Walls and gates come in two tiers: stone and wood. Fences have three tiers and archer towers have two tiers. The defensive buildings are things to be set up and forgotten about until they stop working. Defending your base from a raid is not very fun because the towers are doing most of the work while you can't even see the people attacking you because walls are so tall. The building themselves are not bad because bases are usually only raided when no one is playing, so having a defensive system that doesn't require sleep is great, but it still takes away alot of the fun that is to be had when you defend against a raid or even when you are the one raiding!\n\nUtility Buildings\nUtility Buildings consists of crafting stations, wells, and storage units/shops, or in other words, every thing that is not a defensive building. Crafting stations are often take on the appearance of things like blacksmith's hut, carpentry buildings, and crafting/cooking tables. These are nothing special and can be operated by placing the required components for a recipe into the building and then clicking on the icon to craft that item. Wells passively create water bottles which can be used in crafting or can be drunk to recover some energy. Storage units, as the name suggests, are used to store things and shops can be used to sell things!\n\nConstruction\nOf course the biggest part of building is actually building. To build all those "wonderful" structures, you will need to gather resources such as firewood, sticks, rocks, rope, and fat. Once you have gathered these, then you can craft a blueprint which can be placed to construct an area were the structure can be made. After this, you or your friends will need to carry heavy logs and stones slowly to the construction site before you can make banging noises with a hammer while the items needed to actually build the structure are sucked from your bag one.... by one.... until finally your structure is a usable building. This sort of building system may create uniformity, bans creativity. The buildings are all predesigned and all take an annoyingly long time to build if you have no one to help you.\n\n\nFarming\nFarming does not just apply to crops, it also applies to the gathering of resources. Mining in Tree of Life is like most MMO's. Ore nodes spawn randomly in a zone and can be punched with your bare fist to mine them. Forestry consists of punching a tree to it has no health and then picking up the sapling and putting it back down and then either punching the log into firewood or carrying it slowly to some place. Planting crops requires you to MAKE a crop plot and then place it down, and then slowly seed each plot. Harvesting those crops amounts to slowly hand picking each plot until only a few plants are left, and then PICKING UP the PLOTS of the remaining plants to get seeds through a bug because harvesting plants doesn't give enough seeds to be sustainable. Fishing is incredibly boring and requires no interaction once you cast the line. Ranching (Caring for Animals) is somewhat lacking because all that must be done to an animal to get products from it is to feed it the correct feed bag and then wait about a minute or two for it to poop out something like milk or antlers. The only thing you really need to do to keep your animals alive is give them medicine when they get sick (and they don't get sick very often).\n\n\nOverall, the game at this state is very lacking and I would suggest that you do not buy it YET.","August 13, 2015","false","72.2"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

Simple as that. Or is it?\n\nI'll quickly talk about the games progression.\n\nThe first thing you may want to do is, Punch trees (Minecraft? Ark?) alot of games have this system now.\nPunching trees will give you twigs, apples and eventually a log.\nPunching the log will give you firewood.\nWith the twigs you can craft torches with E [Putting the twigs into your inventory] (this is to get your "tinkering" up and so you have a light source at the night.\n\nTorches can also be used to light campfires (you must create one to survive and cook food)\n\nIt took me a while to figure out how to consume food... You must right click+Drag to consume the food.\n\nFrom there you can figure it out.\n\nSince the game is Multiplayer, expect to work together (if you can) or not (if you have a language barrier).\nPlay with friends and the progress will be alot better.\n\nTheres also a level cap in the game. As you will have a limited amount of points you can spend. (which is kind of stupid).\nMost people in this game will want to work alone (i haven't seen a single person talk within the game).\n\nIf you die. You become a spooky ghost. Spooky! There is a cooldown for you to ressurect, you can shorten it from consuming soul shards from Skelebobs.\n\nThis game is fun. I would recommend this.\nHowever, i probably won't play it anymore in a while as i have other games that require my attention.\nIf this game had a single player i would probably play it more.","June 24, 2015","true","1.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I'm a littled bored by it now. It was fun learning how to play, building a base, and advancing skills. But now I'm pretty burned out by it and it's starting to feel more like a chore than anything else.\n\nSo here is how the game works at the moment and this is why I say it feels like a chore.\n\nYou build a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ base somewhere. It's nice though, it's home. You might fish for food, you might kill bear, or you might find crab on the beach. While you're slowly improving your home, you're leveling up skills. After a few levels, your base doesn't have to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ anymore. You can build wooden walls around your home to keep intruders and monsters out. But you'll also need Arrow towers to defend your walls from anyone/anything that trys to destroy your walls. Well, arrow towers need arrows. So go spend an hour making arrows. But that was kinda boring, so you log out for the day. Tomorrow you log back on, and there are a few holes in the wall. You repair them, and you check why the wall wasn't defended. Maybe you need more arrow towers, or maybe your towers ran out of arrows over night. So you go make more arrows. But that was kinda boring, so you log out for the day.\n\nWash, rinse, repeat.\n\nDon't get me wrong.

There have been few games that hold my attention for long, the last one being Archeage. I'm seeing a trend with Korean games... I think the best part is that the devs are actively improving the game by fixing bugs and listening to community suggestions. I think the best features in the game is the ability to design your own base and have shops all over the map where you can sell your wares. You can also go fishing, cook your food for yourself and others, craft torches, lanterns so that you can see in the dark. You can steal from cabins/tents with lockpicking or people who don't lock their cabins/tents up. You can practically build anywhere on the map, live anywhere you want. You can become a traveling trader and make money doing trade deals with guilds and individuals. You can pick up animals and bring them to your base. There is a lot of things to do that will keep you occupied for awhile. Great job on the game!","June 12, 2015","true","289.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Combat is simple and just involves mashing mouse clicks (Holding the mouse is slower for weapons like daggers).\n\nThe constantly progressing server makes it so that maintanence is required for things like your base and all your work stations because monsters tend to be able to spawn inside the walls of the base.\n\nThe pvp is fair in my opinion, punishing those who attack other players or thier possessions with the "red" status, putting a target on those who do things that seem morally wrong. (Though it does seem a bit excessive that destorying 2 buildings would be a 4 hour red status).\n\nIf you plan on buying tree of life, it is highly recommended that you start with a group of friends and in those 2 hours before losing the ability to refund it, have a goal in mind because the game is not going to give you one. Friends are a nessessity because the whole aspect of just grinding/farming materials is grueling. The amount or resources needed to build anything of substance is Too damn high (meme intended) for just a single person to endure.\n\nA recommendation i would have for the game is that the traces of evil should be more substantial instead of just inventory trash. Maybe have an option to forgive the person and immediately remove their red status or give an option to track down the mother fornicater who wrecked your wall and stole "yo ♥♥♥♥".\n\nOverall, having fun with the game with a group of friends, looking forward to more content, and hopefully a positive release.\n","June 11, 2015","true","37.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I just hope that the climax doesn't drop as soon as one has built an awesome village... As of now, this seems to be an issue. Games like these needs the climax to keep rising, even after the main excitement has been experienced...\n\nUnfortunately for this game, this seems to be a major issue. This leads to other people revolting in the game and destroys everything they see.\n\nIf this game doesn't get a mission option soon, or, different level system throughout the world (meaning the monsters get tougher in different regions), the game will not satisfy players.\n\nI enjoy what they've done so far and I really hope that they'll fix these issues before this world becomes all dark.","June 11, 2015","true","18.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
