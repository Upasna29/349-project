Tastes better too, and is cheaper on average.","February 27","false","0.3"," 70 of 109 people (64%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","64","70","109","13","4"

Do you hate the 4th wall and wish it were dead?  Want something that doesn't take itself seriously?  Or maybe you just want some hand-drawn achievements?  If so, this game is for you.\n\nThis is a very silly game.  It's the kind of game they'd be playing at Camelot.  It's basically a visual novel with (VERY) light "RPG" elements.  There's battling that is mostly conversation based and really revolves around picking the right thing to say, like being able to pick rhyming lyrics against an enemy who likes music, or making a holy man question his faith.\n\nAs a side bonus (??) there is a lot of gender confusion in this game if you choose the male option!\n\nThere's a Tentakul LivePlay of the game here if you want to see how it plays: https://youtu.be/EnRi9CtWC0o","March 4","true","0.7"," 27 of 43 people (63%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","63","27","43","7","1"

Aside from the silent protagonist, this game is nearly fully voiced.  It's well acted and adds to the games humor.  I haven't read any of Lovecraft's works; fans of the author may find some references more droll.  That does't mean that someone who is unfamiler with lovecraft won't enjoy the game.  It's fun and zany like Animaniacs.  The game is more enjoyable when watching someone else unfamilar with the mechanics and overall references play.  Watching my teenage nephew try and fail with the games opening battle (a simple child's nursery rhyme) was worth the games price.","May 14","true","4.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Fun visual novel; making fun of itself throughout...not drop on the floor funny, but made me smile at times.  RPG elements are there, although I don't really know if they do much of anything.  "Fights" occur throughout, which are basically puzzles related conversation replies; most fairly simple once you know what the correct trend is in each fight.   You can die during these battles and be sent to the Game Over screen; so you may want to save periodically so as not to have to backtrack too far.   A fun diversion for what it is.   I wouldn't play it again but would pick up DLC if it was a new story (or continuing story).  For Achievement seekers, I would think you could at least double the play time as there does seem like there were more areas to explore before the game forced the ending sequence.","April 24","true","5.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","2"

I like the ideas behind it, and though I'm sure it could have been executed better, I can't wait to see what the DLC will bring.\nThis is hilarious and honestly, something I liked more than I expected.\n\nI'm not fond of the art, nor some of the voices, but I got the game from someone, so who am I to complain?\n\nHowever, there have been some bugs I've encountered (such as a few infinite loops), so that is a pain. These may be fixed by the recent patches, though!\n\nAdditionally, there are a lot of things in the screencaps I've yet to see, despite the game itself being very short (I've 'finished' it like 6 times in the 6 or so hours I've played it).\n\nIt is kind of annoying when it says "this is content for the sequel" though.","April 30","true","17.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The game breaks the 4th wall many times and keeps a light mood. Few critisisms but will list them below:\n-There are no aspect ratio options even though you can go full screen (still includes black bars)\n- You can go to a lot of places even though there's nothing there\n- No apparent way to see your current quests.\n- It'd be nice to be able to rest for more than 1 day at a time (like a slider to sleep for 10 days to get full health or something)\n- Inventory system is unintuitive. If you equip an armor piece, it replaces the one you have (no purchase neccessary) unless you put it in your empt slot first. You cant keep a collection to swap out for later\n\nI'm sure there are some others, but feel free to watch my video on the game! :D\n\nhttps://youtu.be/U0dYqAsR7Os","February 15","true","0.8"," 18 of 42 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","18","42","0","0"
