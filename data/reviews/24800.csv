"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/recommended/24800/","Lunaril","Lunaril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/","880 products in account","Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 - Uprising, is a standalone expansion to Red Alert 3.  The story takes place after the events of Red Alert 3. In campaign mode, no matter which campaign you choose, the Empire of the Rising Sun, and the Soviets have surrendered to the Allies, if you aren't a fan of the allies, you might be disappointed. The campaigns seem a little short too, with only a couple of missions per campaign, unlike previous Red Alert games. This would have been better as a dlc to the original Red Alert 3, rather than a standalone. There are a bunch of new mapsfor skirmish mode, and some new weapons as well as units you can play around with. Uprising, also comes with the Commanders Challenge, which could be purchased as an additional stand alone, but without the campaign mode of uprising.  I have a mixed-bag of feelings about this game, but I am a fan of the Red Alert series overall. Because of the new content and the commander's challenge mode, which has way more content then the campaigns, I think Red Alert 3: Uprising redeems itself. As I said, I think it would have made a better DLC to Red Alert 3, than a stand alone, but it's still a decent play.","July 16, 2015","true","4.6"," 50 of 59 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","50","59","2","0"

See Conclusion\nNOTE: Some of the PROS and CONS of my Red Alert 3 Review are still applicable in the expansion. You can read it here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/17480\n\nINTRODUCTION:Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 Uprising is the stand-alone expansion to the RTS game 'Red Alert 3', which has been released by Electronic Arts in 2008. This expansion features new units, new campaign missions, new skirmish maps and new live action characters (most notably, professional wrestler Richard Morgan "Ric" Fliehr)\n\nThe story takes place where the events of Red Alert 3 resulted in a canonical Allied Victory. The Soviet campaign involves the Soviets attempting to stop the European Union President's plans to remove the Soviet Union from history with the help of an Allied Military Contractor called FutureTech. The Allied campaign focuses on pacifying remaining Imperial Commanders who still resist allied occupation of Japan. The Empire campaign is based on defeating Soviet Commanders who seeks to have a land grab of Imperial Territory while the Empire is vulnerable. A special campaign is also available where the player takes on the role of Imperial Commando Yuriko Omega and her origin story.\n\nPROS:+ New Campaign Missions but...(See CON #1)\n+ Yuriko Campaign is an interesting twist to the C&C formula although borrowing heavily from StarCraft's 'single unit' missions\n+ New units that are both powerful and fun to use\n+ Fun new game mode: 'Commander's Challange'\n+ Stand-alone\n\nCONS:- Short campaign with under developed plots\n- Campaign coop (even the coop AI) was removed\n- New units caused severe balance issues that resulted in...\n- Removal of Multiplayer, both LAN and Online\n- Removal of Skirmish live action cutscenes (which I found very entertaining in the base game)\n- Live action cutscenes were lazily made\n- Forces players to play the Soviet Campaign first before unlocking the 2 other campaigns (which was not the case with Red Alert 3)\n- Expensive for an expansion with several features removed from the base game (like multiplayer)\n\nCONCLUSION:NICE LITTLE EXPANSION but does not live up to the quality or scale of Red Alert 2's expansion; Yuri's Revenge. Red Alert 3 Uprising is not a bad game  if you like the single player experience like myself . Despite having said that, the game feels as though it was rushed with many of its elements (particularly the Campaign), being half baked.\n\nThe removal of Multiplayer, caused by poorly balanced units, is one of the greatest sins anyone can do to an RTS game, even if its just an expansion. This prompts me to say that Red Alert 3 Uprising does not warrant its full price considering that it's currently priced the same as the Base game. BUY IT on a SALE or BUNDLE but NEVER at FULL PRICE.\n\nWhy do I still RECOMMEND this game? Well I particularly enjoyed the Commander's Challenge (more than the Campaign actually) It gave me several hours of fun. I DO NOT RECOMMENDED this game if you're looking to play Multiplayer.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

It DOSEN'T SUPPORT multiplayer. If you want play on-line, buy the red alert 3.\n\nIt has "challenge mode" which is fun and really hard. Well, I cleared all the infamous AOE3 and AOE2 campaigns on hard and that's nothing compared to this one. It will drive you crazy if you're going to clear "on time"missions. (The AI is insane, you can belive me) You're going to think a lot while playing it :)\n\nGreat challenge mode indeed but personally, the campaign was'nt that good.\n\nIf you looking for intense and challenging game than you may go for it. Otherwise you may be better off not buying it.","December 22, 2013","true","142.0"," 41 of 50 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","41","50","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/recommended/24800/","gosedre","Gosedre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/","215 products in account","Red Alert 3 Uprising is one of those games you either love or hate. I for one love it, and let me tell you exactly why.\n\nLet's get this out of the way first; this stand alone expansion has no multiplayer component. None. Not even coop. There are some unit in this game that upset the balance to such a degree that it would be unethical to let anyone play against one another. If you can get over this, then you'll like the game. If you really need this mulitplayer thing, then you might want to pass.\n\nWith that out of the way, let me describe Uprising for you. Uprising is an exercise in scenario building. It tries to create the coolest kinds of single player levels seen in RTS ever with ridiculous units and abilities that make a game of Warcraft seem tame. Image transforming tanks, ice beams, rockets everywhere, robots, tanks that eat buildings and giant floating heads with death rays that make any unit or building completely worthless. It does not end there. Each civ gets a few new units. The allies get to parade their new giant gunship and otherworldly tanks, as well as freeze troopers. The soviets have to do with a complete hack of an infantry killer, and some fast mechs. No, for the really cool stuff you need to check with the empire, who come rolling onto the scene with laser archers, robots with swords and the aforementioned flying death ray. Plenty of cool stuff to go around and no stupid balance that is holding any of it back.\n\nThe game features three gamemodes. The campaigns, that come with some really impressive production value. General skirmishes. Finally, the commanders challenge. Where you have to overcome extremely strong AI opponents with limited units. Each victory gives you access to new units to use in your conquest. It is extremely hard, and fiendishly challenging, but funny and rewarding.\n\nI can reccomend this expansion. It's a blast while it lasts, and it provides some of that cartoonish fun that you don't get in any of the newer RTS games. If this is on sale, just shell those two bucks and indulge in some robot vs tank tomfoolery. You know you want to.","February 15","true","11.0"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","85","29","34","7","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/csabber3/recommended/24800/","csabber3","Green Lantern","http://steamcommunity.com/id/csabber3/","174 products in account","Tutorial to how to make RA3 - Uprising. Step 1: finish developing RA3, one of the most ambitious RTSes of 2008. Step 2: take all your assets, ideas that couldn't fit in the original game or haven't made the deadline and put them together. Step 3: craft a really lame and superficial campaign for each fraction as a wrap-around. Step 4: add Yuriko to the mix. Thus, Command & Conquer Red Alert 3 - Uprising has been born.\n\nUprising isn't a bad game. However, it wants to do so many thing at once that it can't achieve a single one of them (well, except one: Yuriko). All three factions got a new mini-campaign which takes place after the original game with the Allies winning the war over the Soviets and the Empire. None of the stories are overlapping this time like they were in the original game. There are 10 levels for the three factions combined and all of them are hard as hell. Even on medium difficulty you will be constantly attacked by the enemy on land, water and in the air. Sometimes the game gets so difficult that it will be annoyingly frustrating. Some levels may require over 1-2 hours to complete on medium and not because they are so long, but because you have to retry constantly.\n\nThe basic gameplay structure hasn't changed, but some new units were introduced on all 3 sides. Some of them are really unconventional and they can upset your good ol' strategies. The building system remained the same, but less than half of the stages start with base building. On most of them you start off with a smaller group and you have to complete some tasks before HQ can send you an MCV. These commando missions are fresh at first but they very quickly became annoying...for all the players crying out loud: just give us a base and let us build an army! We don't want to play commando with conscripts and attack dogs against tanks and robots! This and the annoying difficulty will make you believe that the creators used these cheap tricks to make the game last longer. Even though it will last longer, they will remain cheap tricks.\n\nOn the visual side the game looks great. Water movement is excellent, explosions are beautiful and devastating. You just can't get enough of a dozen Apocalypse Tank annihilating the enemy base. Splendid! Anyone who has seen a Red Alert game knows that its' cutscenes are performed by flesh and blood human actors and actresses. Also anyone can tell that these cutscenes are missing one thing only and that is good acting. The actors are still unconvincing and disbelieving, not that the words that were put into their mouths are any better. Sometimes you just wish the next cut-scene will be a lot shorter and without any speech at all. The debrief ladies look hot though and the short skirt of that Gemma Atkinson's won't disappoint you.\n\nWhen you finish the campaigns you can try the most innovative and fun part of the game. Yuriko's mini-campaign. She is a psyche with mental powers capable of devastating armies. You have access to 4 powers at one time. After using a power you have to wait for the cooldown time. You can brainwash enemies to fight on your side, create black holes that suck everything inside or simply heal yourself with her powers. This game mode is really interesting, intriguing and its the greatest fun you can find in this game.\n\nWhen you are done with the mini-campaigns you can play Skirmish, where nothing has changed from the original or play Challenge missions which are actually a lot like Skirmish maps only with cutscenes and a limited arsenal. When you beat a challenge new ones will appear and by beating them you can unlock new units to fight with. Before starting a map you can always select your fraction. It's nothing groundbreaking but thanks to the limited arsenal and gameplay tweaks this game mode can engage lots of players. And finally, there is the multiplayer...oh...wait...there aren't any MP or Co-op modes in this game! No MP in an RTS game. Well played EA, just well played!\n\nRating: 57/100; Replay Value: 3/5; To Beat: 10-12 hours; Played on: medium/easy.","September 15, 2013","false","8.4"," 65 of 106 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","65","106","2","0"

It's a fairly solid game, but it has a few basic flaws. First, there's only three factions. Sure, that keeps it a bit easier to know the enemy, but still- only three factions. To make up for that, almost each and every individual unit has a special ability. This makes the game that much more interesting, but also makes it incredibly daunting for new players to get into the game. In addition, it won't run in a window, and as a streamer, that makes the game slightly less good. Finally, some mechanics seem to make the game really unbalanced, like the ability to abduct an enemy's vehicles at will with the magnetic thing.\n\nOn the other hand, the game gets a solid ten in cool factor. The Americans have advanced cryogenic technology, the Japanese have amazing transforming robots, and the Russians have bears.\n\nHonestly, the bears are the best part of the game. I mean, you can load the bears in cars, fly them around in helicopters, and they're an amphibious unit, so the bears can swim across the ocean.\n\nBuy it for the bears.

Although Westwood Studios (former publisher of the C&C Red Alert series) was liquified back in 2002/early 2003, not long after RA2 Yuris Revenge released, some of the crew assimilated into EA. Although this was a sad time, when RA3 was announced I had high hopes and Id like to think that RA3 hit almost all the expectations.\n\nAnd then I saw this. I had been a little caught up with exams and such when this was originally released so I completely missed it and stumbled upon it on Steam a few weeks ago. I gleefully wrung my hands together and bought it, excited at the chance to try some new tactics and try out the new units and maps.\n\nHere is where the real review starts:\nCampaign\nThe campaigns are short. Four missions per story and they are very basic missions although I personally found most fairly challenging, more so than the base game.\nHowever whilst playing most missions I felt extremely overwhelmed by the seemingly unstoppable enemy forces. For example in one Allied story mission you are expected to transport an MCV to a set location then set up and defeat any Empire units and bases in the vicinty. The transportation part was simple enough and once the base is set you are introduced to a new unit The Harbringer, a large AC130 esque ship with some capabilities to deal with ground units. Suddenly all hell breaks loose, as soon as I was given control of the base, resources and units I instantly come under attack from a (almost cheat worthy) slew of enemy units when Ive had less than 2 minutes to begin producing anything. Needless to say I was slaughtered and had to try the mission at least 4 times before successfully finishing it.\n\nYuriko's 'backstory'\nBefore I knew it I had burned my way through all the main army stories leading me to play the equally as short story of Yuriko Omega (that hero unit from the Empire that was kinda meh). Her story was taken in a different approach than the others as it was made into a Dungeon Siege esque 'minigame'. You have different abilites each mapped to 1-4 of your keyboard numbers. This was rather enjoyable and the new take on the gameplay was refreshing. Like the main armies her story was short but even more so than the mains as it was only 3 missions (2 of which take place in the same location).\nAfter I finished her story (which still gave her barely any backstory at all it felt more like a filler episode from Naruto) I decided to head into Commander Challenge mode.\n\nCommander Challenge\nThis is a new mode implemented specifically for this standalone. This mode allows to you play missions with any army but limits what units you have until you beat certain missions to unlock. Each mission has a par time and scores depending on various factors, giving it plenty of replayability if you are one of those people who like to beat record times and such. I however am not and burned my through it, enjoying the story mission feel of the challenges but also the limitations made me test new tactics.\n\nSkirmish\nNow the part I really wanted to get too.\nThe skirmish mode. Sucks ♥♥♥ in this game.\nAlthough no description in the game says so there are quite a few new maps in the game which offer new skirmish fun...HOWEVER MOST OF THE BASE GAME SKIRMISH MAPS HAVE BEEN REPLACED. There a few select maps taken from RA3 but most are new maps which are barely creative, fairly generic and small. Even the 6 player maps are tiny, which can be fun if hectic battles where you can barely build anything is fun.\nAdditionally the co-commander features have been completely removed. Gone. Disappeared from existence.\nEven in Skirmish mode where you could have Ai teammates to take on other enemy AI they have completely removed the team based battles. I understood that they removed it for story but removing it from the standalone altogether? Little bit OTT if you ask me.\n\nMultiplayer\nAnd I bet you're wondering where the multiplayer part is............well there isnt one. Multiplayer isnt a thing in this standalone for some unknown reason. They decided to isolate the multiplayer community for this game because "♥♥♥♥ you we're EA". Not that many people played online anyway.\n\nPro/Con summary  So to sum up the points\nPros Enjoyable gameplay\nChallenging story missions\nNew units are fun to play with\nCommander Challenge is challenging\nSome returning live action actors from RA3\nCons Short stories\nSometimes overwhelmingly difficult\nAI seem to be low key cheating (far superior rate of income/unit production) *Story only*\nSkirmish maps have barely any variety\nRemoves most of the good maps from RA3\nCompletely removes game mechanic from previous game (Co-commander feature)\nNo multiplayer feature (Lan or internet)\n\nFinal Summary  Overall this game was a bit of a disappointment. It seemed to take so many good parts from RA and just remove them altogether whilst compensating for said removal with new units, barely thought through stories and generic/boring maps. Although there are some good points like the Challenge mode and the dungeon crawler Yuriko story this game should of just been a macro transaction for RA3, adding all those features onto the base game.\n\nI would recommend that you go buy RA3 base game instead of this and hope that there is a mod which adds the new maps and units into the base game.\n\nBut hey ho just another game series that EA decided to ♥♥♥♥.","May 18","false","33.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","3"

At least give the other Command & Conquer titles or Red Alert 3 a try before you take on this game - it's not entirely beginner friendly lol.\n\nAlthough this is definitely not the best RTS games among the Command & Conquer series (Command & Conquer: Generals FTW!) but it's still a pretty decent game overall. It's worth giving this game a try if you have played and enjoyed Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 (RA3) and wouldn't mind finding out what happened after RA3. This Uprising expansion of the original RA3 continued the story of RA3 and also introduced a few new units. However, some new units turn out to be quite overpowering and can result in imbalanced gameplay, but that's okay since the offline campaign are pretty well-crafted and this expansion has no multiplayer anyway.\n\nCompared with the earlier RTS titles from the Command & Conquer series, the AI in this game is hella smart - better at expanding, sneakier attacks, more versatility at units selection, use of superpowers and greater capability at rebuilding in the event that their main base is destroyed. If the considerable difficulty in the campaign doesn't impress you and you are looking for some hardcore challenges, you can give the Commander's Challenge (CC) mode a try too! Some of the challenges featured in CC are pretty extreme yo.

The units are even more insane, the national stereotypes are even worse and the cleavage is off the charts.\n\nThe map design however is probably the biggest flaw in this game. From the first map onwards you are treated to frustrating grind, self-contradicting mission objectives and maps that assumes you already knows everything about the original. The complete lack of any sort of a proper introduction or explanation to the units or the gameplay makes much of the game an exercise in trial and error and that's something that gets boring very fast.\n\nThis is the end of Red Alert, it's not even simply mediocre anymore it's gone full blown crap. It's a bad game who's only redeeming factor is the amount of breasts you get treated to during the cutscenes, and that's not enough of a reason to buy a game.","November 4, 2012","false","59.9"," 19 of 33 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","19","33","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/24800/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","972 products in account","TLDR: Standalone Real Time Strategy game following the events of Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3. You don’t need the base game to play this, but in my opinion, you should probably play the base game before trying Uprising. 7/10\n\nIf you’ve played any of the Command & Conquer (C&C) games, you should know that they’re a little bit silly in terms of overacting and racial stereotyping, but fun in their gameplay. The Red Alert series in particular is less about being realistic and more about having crazy units battling each other (Russian war bears, Japanese Samurai, Allied sonic attack dolphins). They also have a long standing tradition of full motion video cutscenes at the start of each mission starring a bunch of familiar faces. None of the actors are huge stars but you should definitely recognize a few. The women wear low cut tops and short skirts while the men are stereotypical badasses.\n\n*Spoilers for Red Alert games*\nThe Red Alert series of C&C games takes place in an alternate history, created by a foolish time traveler who thought he was doing the world a favor by going back and taking out Adolf Hitler before he rose to power. Unfortunately, the time traveler never took into account that Joseph Stalin’s Soviet Union would rise to power in the mid-20th century, and without a powerful Nazi war machine to oppose them, the USSR rolled across Europe and Asia conquering everyone in their path. Instead of USSR + the Allies versus the Nazis, it became Allies versus USSR. In Red Alert 3 (the game right before Uprising), the Empire of the Rising Sun (Japan) came out of nowhere, challenging the Allies and the USSR with their super advanced technology. The Allies manage to barely come out on top, and Uprising takes place very soon after the victory.\n\nRed Alert 3 Uprising, like other Command & Conquer games is a Real Time Strategy game divided into 4 separate campaigns, 1 for each of the 3 factions and a fourth campaign which follows a single character as a pseudo RPG (like the Tassadar missions in Starcraft 1). Since Uprising is just sort of a standalone expansion, each campaign has only 4 missions. Be advised that the game is quite difficult (except the RPG campaign, which is kind of just for fun/story). Just like Supreme Commander Forged Alliance, you are tossed into the thick of it without any easy “learning missions.” If you’ve played any of the previous C&C games, the mechanics are very similar. Almost everything is done with your mouse “right click.” You may find that the resource gathering is a lot simpler in Uprising because the resources are in fixed locations. You don’t need to send your vulnerable ore harvesters out into the middle of nowhere gathering minerals.\n\nPros:\n+The pre-mission cutscenes are enjoyable as always, with recognizable actors hamming it up on screen.\n+There is a lot of variety in gameplay, not just in the large number of different unit types, but also the occasional “commando” missions where you’re sneaking around behind enemy lines.  The money flows pretty freely in the game so you can afford a bunch of very powerful units, and every unit in the game has some sort of secondary/special ability. Every mission takes about an hour, so even though each campaign only has 4 missions, it takes about 12 hours to beat the game. Not bad for an expansion.\n\nCons:\n-The game has no multiplayer, though it does have a skirmish mode where you can play vs the computer 1 on 1.\n-As mentioned above, the game is quite hard, and this really shouldn’t be the first Command & Conquer game you play. The difficulty might turn off new players.\n\nOverall the game is a lot of fun, and if you enjoy old school Real Time Strategy games, you should enjoy Uprising as well. If you have the other games in the series, play them in order. Unlike a lot of modern games with multiple campaigns, the campaign endings in the Red Alert series are mutually exclusive. If you win with the Russians, you conquer the world and Russia rules all. If you win with the Allies, the Russians are completely defeated, etc.\n","May 20, 2015","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You have to play the soviets first though a mission or two to unlock the others and the only two stories I like in this one is the soviets and Yuriko's because I could understand why they want to do stuff, but the other two is merely a grab for power and such.\n\nAlll in all, nice new units, but the campaigns are a bit short so it's a okey buy and you don't need red alert 3 to run so maybe buy it when it's on sale like I did, I believe.

Everything needs to be micro-managed, your units have ZERO level of intelligence. Enemy units will always use the best weapon against a unit, yours are just dumb and will use the weapon they currently have selected no matter what. This means that you have to constantly micro-manage every group of unit you have, you can't just have groups moving in place and trust them to defend themselves, they will just get decimated by one enemy unit that happens to have a weapon capable of destroying your units and will not even fight back. It takes a LOT of clicking/hotkeying to get your units to use the right weapon, and that weapon is probably useful against only a few of the enemy units you are currently encountering. Of course, if you don't tell them to attack the units to which their weapon actualy does damage, well, you're screwed, they will keep attacking other units inneffectively until they die. Micro-managing... Micro-managing... Micro-managing... Micro-managing... Micro-managing... AAAAAAAARGH.\n\nThis game is very tedious to play, it feels like work, not a lot of fun to be had here.

Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\n3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\n4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

At least Renegade was fun in multiplayer.\n\nThe jokes make are cringe-inducing. The FMVs don't have the home made earnestness that made the early games charming. The unit balance is non-existent. The game gives every single unit an ability that is annoying and unnecessarily effective. The missions are drawn out slug fests until you can deathball their static defenses. The pathfinding comes straight from 1999.\n\nIt's like grandpa EA is elbowing you in the ribs, wanting you to notice that he gets the irony of the franchise and is trying to be edgy.","March 18","false","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A lot of people here are talking about how the units are so overpowered, but to be honest I think it's the enemy units that are too overpowered. I'm not a super-veteran of RA3 but I do definitely know the ins and outs of the game. I feel like too many of the campaign missions in this game rely less on skill and more on avoiding fights outright to avoid getting annihilated or spam building 1 unit and then doing a crazy rush in order to try and take an objective right before losing your entire forces.\n\nI love the Red Alert series but this felt like a half-baked cash grab and I wasn't impressed that there's no multiplayer. For €2 though I guess I can't complain but I can't recommend the game either.","April 4","false","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

"Raking in the money" doesn't even begin to cover it.\n\nBy the 2000s Westwood had set the standard for macro based RTS games so high that almost everyone else in the genre just gave up or sold themselves over to strangled food cap or hero gimmickery,\n\nSo what happened?\n\nEA bought them out.

The most interesting is a series of story missions revolving around the Japanese character Yuriko which play like a variation of Diablo rather than an RTS title. Yuriko progresses through her own story and the character increases in power in enjoyable fashion.\n\nThere's also traditional RTS missions that play out similar to base RA3, but sadly the extra feature of co-op play has been dropped. The new unit toys are a fun addition and are very worthwhile.\n\nFinally there's a challenge mode where you have an escalating series of tasks to accomplish with a limited unit selection. Winning missions grant more units so there's an element of puzzle solving to get the best results, which can be fun but also equally frustrating. Look to Youtube for mission walkthroughs for help.\n\n$20 is an acceptable price.  $10 is easy, and the sales I've seen at $5 are a no-brainer.","March 7, 2011","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So it's pretty short compare the Red Alert 3 iteration. You start, start to like your team but it's already the end. The story is just plain. No big boobs plan as RA3 which was bad... but this one is worst proposing just nothing at all. Videos are empty, short and boring. Interresting caracters don't appear in videos, you are stuck with *second level actors* (sidekicks) lieutenants. Forget Tim Curry, Jonathan Pryce, Peter Stormare, *God* George Takei and J.K. Simmons. :(\n\nThey added a gameplay called "Commander's Challenge" which it's just a challenge mode that you must do under the part time. This add few hours of gameplay but doesn't fix for the short plain campaign mode. You become better just learning the scenario and try again... turn to be a boring type of gameplay for me.\n\nAnd the game do not contains any multiplayer mode!

I deeply suggest you play the original Red Alert 3 before playing this game. It offers some small story missions, a whole chapter about Yuriko Omega, which is really fun, and a brand new Challenge mode, which is where you'll probably find the most enjoyment. In it, you start with only few units unlocked, and you play on maps in order to unlock new units. It's a really fun mode which forces you to think outside the box.\nNOTE that this DOES NOT have multiplayer.\nIf you like RTS of the franchise, this is a great game.","June 3, 2014","true","155.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you haven't played the previous Red Alert's and want to buy this game, I suggest play Red Alert 3 first. I was a fan of Command&Conquer games since like 2009, especially the Red Alert series. It's a relief to have this game after playing hundreds and hundreds of hours of Red Alert 3 with the same ol' s**t, where Kirov's, Twinbaldes, Mirage Tanks, Athena cannons and Shogun's can always win you the game. Now, with the Giga's and Harbingers the enemy can pretty much wreck you if you let them build some. Also the Challenge mode and the Yuriko story is really fun, though short. Sadly no multiplayer though.\nOverall, great addition to Red Alert 3. Although if you haven't played Red Alert 3 and wanna buy this game, you probably won't know what the f*ck's going on. :)","May 25, 2014","true","83.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This leads to micro managing each individual unit as combat happens so their special abilities get used (when appropriate) because simple vanilla-style combat has horrible attrition leading to massive costs for rebuilds and total depletion of minable resources.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/recommended/24800/","whoota","[T-A!] Whoota","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/","307 products in account","Red Alert 3 Uprising is one of those games you either love or hate. I for one love it, and let me tell you exactly why.\n\nLet's get this out of the way first; this stand alone expansion has no multiplayer component. None. Not even coop. There are some unit in this game that upset the balance to such a degree that it would be unethical to let anyone play against one another. If you can get over this, then you'll like the game. If you really need this mulitplayer thing, then you might want to pass.\n\nWith that out of the way, let me describe Uprising for you. Uprising is an exercise in scenario building. It tries to create the coolest kinds of single player levels seen in RTS ever with ridiculous units and abilities that make a game of Warcraft seem tame. Image transforming tanks, ice beams, rockets everywhere, robots, tanks that eat buildings and giant floating heads with death rays that make any unit or building completely worthless. It does not end there. Each civ gets a few new units. The allies get to parade their new giant gunship and otherworldly tanks, as well as freeze troopers. The soviets have to do with a complete hack of an infantry killer, and some fast mechs. No, for the really cool stuff you need to check with the empire, who come rolling onto the scene with laser archers, robots with swords and the aforementioned flying death ray. Plenty of cool stuff to go around and no stupid balance that is holding any of it back.\n\nThe game features three gamemodes. The campaigns, that come with some really impressive production value. General skirmishes. Finally, the commanders challenge. Where you have to overcome extremely strong AI opponents with limited units. Each victory gives you access to new units to use in your conquest. It is extremely hard, and fiendishly challenging, but funny and rewarding.\n\nI can reccomend this expansion. It's a blast while it lasts, and it provides some of that cartoonish fun that you don't get in any of the newer RTS games. If this is on sale, just shell those two bucks and indulge in some robot vs tank tomfoolery. You know you want to.","July 2, 2014","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The most interesting is a series of story missions revolving around the Japanese character Yuriko which play like a variation of Diablo rather than an RTS title. Yuriko progresses through her own story and the character increases in power in enjoyable fashion.\n\nThere's also traditional RTS missions that play out similar to base RA3, but sadly the extra feature of co-op play has been dropped. The new unit toys are a fun addition and are very worthwhile.\n\nFinally there's a challenge mode where you have an escalating series of tasks to accomplish with a limited unit selection. Winning missions grant more units so there's an element of puzzle solving to get the best results, which can be fun but also equally frustrating. Look to Youtube for mission walkthroughs for help.\n\n$20 is an acceptable price.  $10 is easy, and the sales I've seen at $5 are a no-brainer.","March 7, 2011","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So it's pretty short compare the Red Alert 3 iteration. You start, start to like your team but it's already the end. The story is just plain. No big boobs plan as RA3 which was bad... but this one is worst proposing just nothing at all. Videos are empty, short and boring. Interresting caracters don't appear in videos, you are stuck with *second level actors* (sidekicks) lieutenants. Forget Tim Curry, Jonathan Pryce, Peter Stormare, *God* George Takei and J.K. Simmons. :(\n\nThey added a gameplay called "Commander's Challenge" which it's just a challenge mode that you must do under the part time. This add few hours of gameplay but doesn't fix for the short plain campaign mode.

If you haven't played the previous Red Alert's and want to buy this game, I suggest play Red Alert 3 first. I was a fan of Command&Conquer games since like 2009, especially the Red Alert series. It's a relief to have this game after playing hundreds and hundreds of hours of Red Alert 3 with the same ol' s**t, where Kirov's, Twinbaldes, Mirage Tanks, Athena cannons and Shogun's can always win you the game. Now, with the Giga's and Harbingers the enemy can pretty much wreck you if you let them build some. Also the Challenge mode and the Yuriko story is really fun, though short. Sadly no multiplayer though.\nOverall, great addition to Red Alert 3. Although if you haven't played Red Alert 3 and wanna buy this game, you probably won't know what the f*ck's going on. :)","May 25, 2014","true","83.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you like a fun RTS-style platform, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!! It is completely horrible. The overhead perspective does not zoom out enough to be very useful in RTS combat. The combat units for each faction are non-intuitive and (in some cases) have simply weird abilities that make combat cumbersome. This leads to micro managing each individual unit as combat happens so their special abilities get used (when appropriate) because simple vanilla-style combat has horrible attrition leading to massive costs for rebuilds and total depletion of minable resources.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/djultrakiller/recommended/24800/","djultrakiller","DJUltrakiller","http://steamcommunity.com/id/djultrakiller/","28 products in account","For my Red Alert 3 review: go  here. Highly recommended to read it in order to understand what I'm talking in this review.\n\nTo start it off, the campaign is shorter than Red Alert 3's, not featuring as many missions as the original game, but there are 4 campaigns now; aside from the normal Allies/Soviets/Empire you also get to play the story of Yuriko Omega, a story which plays pretty much like a MOBA match. For each mini-campaign there are only 3 missions, but make no mistake, missions are not easy, even with difficulty toned down.\n\nMost of the new units added are an interesting and useful addition, but there are a few which seemed pretty broken, as in pretty overpowered:\n\nHarbinger Gunship (Allies): These are the Mammoth Tanks of GDI from C&C 3, with two twin-engines strapped to them. They are able to switch between twin Collider cannons (same but smaller cannon as the Proton Collider superweapon) and an infantry-shredding auto-gun. What ticks me off about this airborne tank is that it has a huge HP pool (oh, it also self-repairs), it shatters everything on the ground, and you'd need quite a bit of anti-air to take them down. If you let your opponent make more than 3 of these and are not aware he's rushing to build them, you can just surrender immediately before you get roflstomped. It is indeed the most expensive unit of the Allies, but it's also very cost-efficient, and can go 1v1 against a sea-landed Giga Fortress.\n\nGrinder (Soviets): Although they fit the character of the faction, any ground forces facing these head-on is going to have a really bad time, because they are borderline impossible to beat without swarming them, and never from the front where the main melee weapon is. This is particularly an issue if you play as Allies because they're hard to escape from and are hard to retaliate against (as Allies you either swarm or use attacks from air). If you play Empire and don't field expensive ground units like King Onis, you're in the clear since you should always have Chopper VX's in your arsenal against these battleship-armor menaces. Oh yeah, these are also amphibious, but thankfully they can't grind your packed MCVs in water.\n\nReaper (Soviets): These are the big bad older brothers of the Sickle. What is most annoying about them is that they are a carbon-copy of Empire's flexibility when placing defensive turrets, except these can shoot back at your units constantly. Their special ability permanently entrenches them and gives them a defensive bonus, not to mention they're both anti-surface and anti-air.\n\nGiga Fortress (Empire): Oh yeah, saved the best for the last. This sonofa♥♥♥♥♥♥ is THE most expensive unit in the entire game, but if you give the Empire player to make one or two of these, you're done for, might as well surrender before getting absolutely smashed. This unit dubs as a mobile sea fortress and a giant airborne head whose attack is also VERY long and pretty wide, doing two series of damage: when  it touches the unit and when the attack explodes a short while after. In its sea form it has 8 guns, faster-firing and more but shorter ranged version of the ones from the Shogun battleship, as well as an array of anti-air/anti-ground rockets. Be extremely wary of this if you play on a map with mini-lakes against a Empire player, because the airborne form has no anti-air capability, but once you give it the chance to get over water, the situation changes dramatically, firing back at your airborne attackers. Here is where those unit disablers (Hydrofoil with the ray gun, Rocket Angel with the para ray) are a must, and you must dish out the Harbinger Gunships/Kirvos against this, preferably when it's on the sea because in air you obviously can't hit it.\n\nSkirmish and multiplayer are covered in my Red Alert 3 review.\n\n","January 18","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
