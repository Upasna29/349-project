It was a disc version of Sonic Adventure DX. I had only played Sonic The Hedgehog on my Sega Mega Drive. I was so excited to play this I immediately installed it on our family computer. I had many fun hours playing this game. But on one cold raining day, I woke up ready to play some more, for I was almost finshed. But as I walked into the office, I saw the disc smashed to pieces on the floor. I ran to my dad in tears. We never found out how it broke. For many weeks I would cry myself to sleep. My dad tryed to find anothe copy. But ever time he went to the shops, it would end in failure. Many years passed and I now play other games to hide my sadness. But as I'm browsing the steam store, I see a game called "Sonic Adventure DX" It was like Jesus himself kissed me on the face. I then bought the game and my childhood was brought back from the dead. This game was my childhood and when it broke, it took my childhood. I feel like a happy little boy again.","November 22, 2014","true","7.7"," 230 of 250 people (92%) found this review helpful 75 people found this review funny","92","230","250","75","19"

There is a fun variety of gameplay from each character and each story is unique, and its cool how they all interlock. Gamma's and Sonic's stories are the best in my opinion. Also, the soundtrack is AMAZING as you would expect from a sonic game.

So consider this game old.\nNow it all depends of your age, if you are between 12-17 years old, I don't recommend you this unless as said on the title, if you are a retro gamer because your first game on a console was Call of Duty MW2 and when Sonic got released you were 3 years old so it explains the criticisms of the other useless reviews.\n\nThe game itself was a huge revolution and was one of the best Dreamcast games. And as every Sonic game, the camera is annoying, the voice acting and the motion capture are not the best points of it but, does a glitched camera and a bad voice acting ruins the game ? If it was bad acting in GTA I would consider.\n\nDespite that, the game is pretty fun, various missions and mini games are available to extend the time of play though the game is quite short (3 hours to end the main Sonic story, but you have 7 chars stories, each is different and more or less shorter. With that you can do trials, 3 per level with each char + mini games and 60 missions throughout the main maps using all characters).\nFinally, a 360 controller is highly recommended, or try to use x360e. But if you can buy this game you can buy a controller.\n\n- This game is definitely one of the best games I ever played in my entire life. I can play it over and over remembering that when I played this game for the first time, I was 11 years old. I'm now 21. :D","December 7, 2013","true","17.3"," 101 of 121 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","101","121","0","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/71250/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Sonic Adventure is a single-player 3D action-platforming game from 10 years ago, and is the first 3D main Sonic game in franchise, not including spin-offs. (Sonic R!) As a result of such major step, it changed Sonic franchise somewhat, from gameplay to style and world. You take control of 6 characters with varying gameplay styles to them, from simply beating the level to, gasp, fishing. It also includes a virtual pet thing (A-Life!) in form of Chao.\n\nNow, since this is old game and most people are familiar with it, let's talk about this Steam port.\n\nFirst, ports history. First came Sonic Adventure, which was a launch title for a Dreamcast. After few years later GameCube players got to enjoy Sonic Adventure: Directors Cut (SADX) which enchanced the game and added missions mode along with unlockable ports of 8-bit Sonic titles. It was then ported to the PC in 2003 year with almost no change. Now, in the 2010 it got rereleased to Xbox 360 and PS3 downlodable services and later it came to PC once agian, onto Steam, as part of Dreamcast Collection. So, how does 2010 Steam version compares?\n\nXbox 360 and PS3 release actually worked like original Sonic Adventure (Didn't check if that was like split DX or actual original, sorry), with DLC available that would upgrade it up to DX edition, lacking 8-bit sonic unlockables though. For Steam version, it's already build-in into the game, so once you purchase this game, you get your whole 2010 DX edition. BUT the achievements stayed exclusive to console versions only. Also, analog control seems to be translated to digital controls just fine, though there are one or so spots where you will have to adjuct camera around and crawl slowly so not to fall off.\nMain competention there comes with comparison to older 2003 PC edition. From technical standoint, the new game release should work better with new hardware, even though I must say that both of them seemed to work fine on Windows 8. I can't notice it myself, but I read that 2010 port has it running at 60 FPS compared to 2003 one 50 FPS. In Steam edition they tried to keep aspect ratio true to how it looked on Dreamcast/GameCube, and as a you will see it being played in a window that doesn't take up your whole (wide) screen, with remaining parts of it being covered with blue-purple pattern... I think that I like staying true to original, with pattern of frame not trying to catch your eyes with colorful art or anything. If you want game to take up whole widescreen by stretching, go with 2003.\nSteam release also has this glitch, due to which your configuration simply will not be saved! To make it save, you will have to go and manually mess with your computer's registry (you can read more in Steam forum of the game). I can guess that Steam doesn't allow games to mess with user's computer registry, since I read that retail copies work just fine. Why does it even need registry to work? ...Well, I can guess that it was mostly based off 2003 PC port, from back when most console ports were weird and had no idea how gaming works on computers.\nA little thing, Steam SA has only Player 1 controls working... No, Sonic Adventure is not exactly 2-Player game, but there was little bonus that the second player could control Tails on screen, at Sonic's gameplay. Can't do it anymore.\nEven though it's based off older PC port, structure of files seemed to change, meaning that programs that worked for 2003 edition, as well as any mods, will not work on this one.\n\nOh, and finally, in-game changes compared to older title... Well, it's actually pretty much same. Almost. For there is rather big change - all of unlockable Game Gear Sonic games got cut. Yep, that means that the only reason to collect emblems now is Metal Sonic skin that you get for all of them. If you already played 8-bit Sonic titles or actually own real things, then you may not care about this, but otherwise it heavily points at 2003 version as a better one. Why have they done this, I don't know, since you there are no 8-bit Sonics on Steam on sale. Well, maybe only in some kind of collection on XBox 360 and PS3.\nOh, and Chao. Should be same, but I heard that 2010 version changed something about breeding, that not every color combination is possible. Sure thing transferring chao is not supported in PC versions either. And I don't know how it was on 2003, but very often you will experience polygon flickering in Chao Gardens, biggest offender to me being a wearable Golden Pot object.\n\nAllright, that's all for differences. Now, game by itself...\nAs a launch game for Dreamcast and it was the first major 3D game of Sonic... That alone meant two things: how rushed it will be and how possibly it may change the face of Sonic (not literally, even if some fans are complaining about green eyes). Now, it did had a lot of changes in a way it worked. Most importanly, physics were simplicifed compared to 2D masterpieces, and as a result it mostly became a game about usual platforming and speed. Loop-de-loops used something what some say as "scripted", in that Sonic is "glued" to invinsible path. (And glued badly!). Hell, if in older 2D titles curling onto ball on top of them would give you a speed boost, in 3D Sonic games it tend to slow you down, with possiblity of falling through. Thankfully, the platforming was solid and still allows it to view as a great game, with varied and fun levels design.\n\nBy the way, this time around game refused to follow the classic arcade system. Instead it has you going "adventuring!" on the open adventures zones, doing some small stuff to open the entrance to action zones. The adventure zones lets you beat action zones that were already done, and you are able to listen to NPCs lines, which aren't mandatory, but some may enjoy how the life of few people go over the course of the game. You find upgrades there too, some are mandatory, others are not. Action zone themselves are made of only single level and has you accomplishing goals that depend on what character you are currently playing as. Dissapointly, there are only few bosses and they are spread over the game unevenly.\nHere is the list of character you get to play as:\n-Sonic The Hedgehog. Fastest one, his goal is simply to get to the end of the level. Able to spindash to roll fast and do homing attack at the enemies.\n-Tails Miles Brower (cutest fox around). His goal is to get to the end of level faster than Sonic. Able to fly for short time by spinning two tails.\n-Knuckles the Echidna. His goal is to find 3 emerald pieces mostly using his sense and occasional hint. Able to glide and attack with his knuckles.\n-Amy Rose. Her goal is to grab balloon at the end of level, avoiding a (pathetic) understroyable robot that chases her. Can do hammer jump and hammer attack. Somewhat clunky, it even feels that she can run faster by moving diagonally.\n-Big The Cat. Slowest one around (best ladder climber btw), his goal is to catch Froggy... Not with gloved hands, no. With his fishing skills. Most random gameplay style in whole game, and getting A-Rank on trials is a living hell.\n-E-102 Gamma. His goal is to make it to the end of level under time pressure. Able to shoot multiple targets, that gives him bonus time.\nYou are going to travel through as many as overall 11 of varied and fun levels, from beaches and casino to ancient temples and assault on flying ship-fortress "Egg Carrier". I must say that each character has his own set of levels out of all 11, and most often they have their own exclusive parts in action zones. And each of zones come with their own varied music tracks, which make use of good amount of styles, momerable and are joy to listen, as always.\n\nThe game was horribly rushed as well. I must say that even a casual gamer would fall through the floor at least once. Comes with unfriendly camera, that hates it when you do something that developers don't want you to (tip: to explore levels)\n\nDamn I ran out of space for review","February 19, 2014","true","119.3"," 55 of 58 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","55","58","0","1"

However Sega has fixed these issues with a patch update and the game looks better in the new 4x3 aspect ration in higher res compared to the original edition. Still you will want to have an XBOX 360 controller to play this game as I've tried to switch my Logitech F310 Gamepad from XBOX 360 Mode to Logitech Dual Action Mode to see what would happen and it was not a fun experience to say the least.\n\nAs far as the "DX" label, I don't agree with it since Sonic Adventure DX was originally a Gamecube game and it was ported to PC before the Sega Dreamcast Collection existed. This version lacks a lot of content that was found in DX, including the unlockable Game Gear games that made playing Sonic Adventure DX on the Gamecube a worth while sit down game. At least the frame rate is more steady in this version of the game compared to the PC port however graphically speaking, the system requirements seem a bit much for porting over an XBOX 360 game to the PC.\n\nIf you are a pure Sonic fan and you have to have this game, its a must own for any Sonic Fan, but if you are looking for port perfection, this game lack in that department a little more then you think.....\n\nOverall rating (Neutral, minus the camera nuisances the overall game presents in some areas.)","January 9, 2015","true","1.9"," 38 of 40 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","38","40","0","1"

It also introduces Chaos chaos which are really difficult to get (and in SA2 is expanded to 3 different Chaos chao, one for each alignment.)\n\nThis game introduced a new character or two along with giving voices to all those who had previously had no voice (save for Sonic and Eggman who would speak on occassion in SEGA Sonic the Hedgehog (arcade game).) It also introduced Homing Attack paths which are usually useful for getting in shortcuts or starting an expert path to the finish.\n\nI still love Tails story due to how broken he is as a character (being able to fly straight to the finish in under one minute in almost all stages aside from Speed Highway) and I still despise Big's story due to how out of place it is along with just being seemingly annoying to me (I love cats, but Big can be a bit annoying at times.)

I played this when the Dreamcast originally was released here in the United Kingdom and was the first game I ever owned for it. I immersed myself within the game immediately, playing it all day, everyday and whenever I could. When I couldn't? I played it in my mind until I could be reunited with it.\n\nEven after all these years, going back to this game has blessed me with the realisation of how enjoyable it was and still is. The game is simple and fast to beat, but everything else a long side the main missions is what makes it a truly epic game. If you truly love playing this game, everything you once knew comes back to you instantly, I don't think there was anything I had forgotten about this game, and there are not many games that give you that experience, proving how enjoyable and entertaining it is.\n\nThe soundtrack is the most memorable part of the game and is by far one of the best sound tracks of any game every released in my opinion. If you haven't heard of CRUSH 40 go give them a listen, however I reckon most Sonic fans know who they are and how amazing their work is. Sure there are some bugs here and there that were in the Dreamcast and Gamecube versions but it's a small price for how nostalgic and great this game is and was for it's time.\n\nAll characters have good and cross-weaving storylines that inevitably come together at the end to defeat the 'Ultimate Evil', ignorantly created by the infamous Dr.Eggman.\n\nOn the side there is cart racing, and the amazing Chao gardens. Chao are little baby creatures that live peacefully with humans and can morph and gain stats in strength, run, flight etc...and can then be put into Chao races. Once you've completed the game and done what you can, you'll probably find yourself here a lot, as the Chao are just literally the best god damn things ever.\n\nIf you haven't played Sonic Adventure/SADX, then I suggest you should. It is by far one of the best games of the Sonic Franchise.","December 14, 2014","true","35.8"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","22","23","0","1"

So, please, do not downvote this just because it's a negative review!\n\nSince most people already have their opinions of Sonic Adventure I feel it is unneeded to talk about much of the gameplay and instead will only talk about the port.\n\nThe GoodIt's Sonic Adventure on a modern system.\nThe game's keys are fully rebindable on both keyboard and controller.\nThe BadThe game seems to pull the textures and controls from the Dreamcast version and not the Gamecube version. (Gamecube is the DX version.)\nThere is no proper widescreen support, you must always play in 4:3 and if you set it higher the game will still be in 4:3, but will have borders. (The update from awhile ago made it so that the borders are no longer on the top and bottom of the game screen, but they are still on the sides.)\nThe game's mission mode is currently bugged and you cannot read the mission hints from the mission screen, this means you are required to use an external resource for the missions.\nIn Tail's airplane minigame the crosshair for the game doesn't scale properly with the screen size so you have to set your resolution lower to be more successful at that minigame.\nAs stated before the camera controls seem like they're from the Dreamcast version; however, they attempt to include some of the second analouge stick controls from the DX version. This often means you just end up fighting the camera if you attempt to rotate it.\nThis one might be some personal bias, but it feels like there are more invisible walls in this version than the DX version.\nThe unlockable Game Gear games, that the Gamecube version had, are removed from this version.\nSummaryI advise people to not purchase the Steam version and instead get a copy of Gamecube's Sonic Adventure DX and run it through Dolphin using the options to improve the graphics, this will actually play better than this port.\nIf you can't pull that off look for the 2003 Sonic Adventure PC port as it is actually a much better port than this!

Of course, it also has the enhanced HD graphics if those are up to your taste (some prefer nostalgia).\n\nPros:\nE-102 Gamma (shooting stages)\nOpen World (Could be a con for some)\nTails accompanies Sonic in his action stages, and can be controlled by a second player to collect items.\nDid I mention Tails isn't in a stupid mech?\nTreasure hunting stages are more polished than SA2, and provide a better detection system.\nThe game feels fluid, and the controls work properly for the most part.\nThe goals of each stage are clearly explained\nFlashy powerups\nExcellent menu theme\nChao garden\nHidden emblems that can be found throughout the open world\nIntense, action based gameplay (for most stages anyway)\n\nCons:\nBig.\nCamera can be wonky (is a problem in all versions)\nScreen resolution is somewhat awkward depending on your monitor\nChao cannot be transferred from SADX to SA2 (without the use of mods)\nButton to pick up a chao is mapped to the same button that pulverizes it (spin dash)\nNo online capabilities, so no online bonuses like on the Dreamcast (again, modding may fix this)\nTerrible voice acting\nMediocre story\nOpen world is pretty mundane\nNo Shadow (I kid...)\n\nHas this game aged well? Probably not, but that doesn't mean it's not fun. It can provide a sense of nostalgia for previous players, and still entertain newcomers. I still prefer the GCN version over this, but this is a solid substitute that can be worth your time.\n\n\n\n","April 21, 2015","true","39.9"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","24","30","5","3"

For ten bucks you get 50 hours of gameplay if you are a completionist, but if you're the type that just plays a game and is done with it then this probably isn't for you. The graphical settings for this game a little bit weird in the way that it favors 16:9 monitors, which I am not a big fan of. Also, if you're going to be buying this game I would recommend having a controller to play with, because playing on a Keyboard and Mouse for these types of games isn't too fun.\n\n(Edit: November 25th, 2015, They seem to have updated the game adding achievements and changing the setup menu.

Sonic Adventure DX is the 2003 version of Sonic Adventure (1999 on Dreamcast). This game proposes a new you look for almost all the characters, the current look for the Sonic Universe characters. Soundtracks are very good once again, the graphism are colorful without being so childish and the storyline is amazing. However, the gameplay is really hard to explain. You will have to play as the 6 game main characters which you will follow their stories, you have Sonic for Speed acts, Tails for the Race against an opponent , Knuckles for the Treasure Hunting acts, Amy for the Escape acts, Gamma E-102 for the Demoliton Time Trail acts and Big for [Huge drumbeats intensifies]....Fishing acts.\n͠° ͟ʖ ͡°\n\nThe world is composed of two parts for each characters ; the acts and the open world which you can have acces to the Chao World and hug your tiny adorable Chao you proudly named Ronald Reagan. In this game, you also have a big load of mission and secondary objectives like the fact you can reach every emblem in the game and obtain a very special additional character. The new archivement are OK in terms of difficulty. The game is also not that hard but you could experience some disagreements with the camera.\n\n→ 72/100","October 6, 2014","true","20.3"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

And yes, I said good. Not great, not awesome,  good.  My opinion may be blurred by the nostalgia I feel when I play it, so I'm trying my hardest to base this review on facts.\n\nThe story is nice, and has an interesting structure. I also love how the player can choose what levels they do, by walking through areas like Station Square and Emerald Island to get to where they need to go, like you would in an RPG. The gameplay is fun, with 6 characters available, each offering different levels and their own storylines, unlike in SA2 (Sonic Adventure DX) where there are just 3 characters which are ruined versions of the characters in this game, along with their evil counter-parts who do exactly the same as them to make 6 shoddy characters. The soundtrack is awesome although sllightly cheesy, with lyrics making you want to hang yourself. The levels are well-made and fun, especially those where you play as Sonic. And of course, who could forget Chaos, the cute, jolly creatures available to be looked after and raced? Personally, I didn't find them that interesting, but I can see why many love them!\n\nOf course, this game has flaws. And many. First off, the camera angles are atrocious, which should be expected in a fast-paced, 3D game, especially when it comes from SEGA. The game is full of glitches which ruin your fun in multiple ways by causing you to die constantly for no reason. The characters are, like in SA2, extremely cringy and un-funny, with their annoying voices and catchphrases, including their god-awful mouth-syncing. Knuckles' levels are boring and repetitive, although more fair and fun than what they were in SA2.\n\nTo conclude, SADX is bad but enjoyable. It's fun levels and gameplay compensate for it's bugginess and how, for a 3D game, it isn't the best. As I mentioned before, I played this as a child and feel a lot of love towards it, so don't take my word for it.\n\nFinal verdict: 7/10\nTL;DR: A fun game with a great design and soundtrack, although it has many bugs and glitches which create many flaws, along with it's cringy characters.","May 2, 2014","true","42.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/polocatfan/recommended/71250/","polocatfan","Polocatfan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/polocatfan/","144 products in account","This is a game I have a history with. As a Kid I loved it. As a "Cynical Teen" I believed "It didn't hold up very well when I replayed it because the game isn't as good." Then I just basically decided to shut the heck up and rate it based on how fun it is now and not how it was or how it will be.\n\nGameplay:\nThis introduced the 3D gameplay of Sonic so you can expect it to be a bit buggy. And yes. It's a bit buggy sometimes but you know it was Sega's first attempt so you can forgive them slightly. There's 6 characters and they all play differently so i'll be rating their gameplays seperately.\n\nSonic: He plays just like you'd think he would. He has the spin dash and the jump like in the genesis days, but in this game he got a few new powers. He can home into an enemy by jumping twice (Akin to the Flame Shield in Sonic 3) he also has the light speed dash and attack where he can dash through a set of rings and later enemies.\n\nHis stages are action packed get to the End. (also if you replay stages a second person can play as Tails like in Sonic 2/3 ^_^. It doesn't help much but it's a nice touch). Almost perfect gameplay. I'm not saying perfect as there's room to improve.\n9/10\n\nTails: He's like Sonic except he doesn't get the Homing Attack or the Light Speed Dash/Attack, but he can fly instead and hit robots with his tails.\n\nTails' stages are races against Sonic (typically) and you can beat Sonic because there are shortcuts placed that Sonic can't get to. My only gripes with this are.\n1. Sonic rubberbands. (meaning the farther you are ahead the faster he goes. he even teleports sometimes.)\n2. They are shorter versions of Sonic's stages.\n\nI give it an 8/10\n\nKnuckles: Knuckles plays completley differently. He retains his glide and climb abilties but gains the ability to dig and punch,\nHis gameplay is spent searching for the emerald shards. There are 3 in every level and you have to find them all.\nThis version of treasure hunting is REALLY fun. (SA2 ruins it a bit).\n\nI give it an 8/10\n\nAmy: Now this is Amy's first time being playable in the main series.(and the last that I know of until Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric :C poor amy).\nShe plays differently to the other characters in that she hits enemies with her hammer and runs away from a badnik named Zero the whole time. (No I don't find this "sexist" because Amy actually fuels the plot and her being kidnapped isn't because "Shes a dainty girl" it's because she fuels the plot.)\nAmy gets a small amount of stages so it doesn't drag on too long.\n\nI give her a 7/10\n\nE-102 Gamma:\nHe pl-... HEY GET OUT OF MY PC! "HES A ROBOT ZOMG HE DOESN'T PLAY LIKE SONIC 0/10 SUX"... anyways yes he doesn't play like any other sonic character to date but IT'S NOT BAD! It's a fun gameplay style and it's different. (I'll go over why I love gamma more in the story section) He shoots enemies to gain time because THE TIMER COUNTS DOWN AND NOT UP! And if it gets to 0 you will die. He plays through missions.\nI give him an 8/10\n\nBig:\nI don't hate Big. I think his gameplay is out of place but I don't hate him. He fishes. Thats all I have to say.\n\n6/10 (for being out of place.)\n\nGameplay total: 7.5/10\n\nStory:\nEach character has a different story but I'll lump a few sets together because they are related.\n\nSonic/Tails: They have a story about fighting [s]Dr. Robotnik[/s] Dr. Eggman and they usually stay together.\n\nKnuckles: He's usually on his own finding the emerald shards. Dr. Eggman managed to trick him again.\n\nAmy/E-102 Gamma: Not gonna spoil it but they have an interaction that is great.\n\nBig: He's usually on his own fishing and trying to find his frog Froggy but he finds a few other people along the way.\n\nRating: 8/10 (if Gamma's story wasn't here it would be an 7/10)\n\nMusic:\n9/10. Just listen to this soundtrack on Youtube.\n\nFinal Score:\n8/10 - Great Game I recommend it a lot.","November 29, 2014","true","4.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

One can almost feel Sonic's emotional pain, wondering "What's it like, being white?"\n\nYou are supposed to be able to play co-op with one person controlling Sonic and one controlling Tails. Unfortunately, both players control Sonic. You can lead him in different directions, and in the end he is torn and confused, unable to go anywhere. The representation of young miles prower's simultaneous independence and loyalty speaks so well to his childhood and friendship, transcending even the thought provoking powerups, each more metaphysical than the last.

It has a great soundtrack (even nowadays), great Levels and overall alot of content (very hard content). It just has to suffer from some small issues. For example, this game has 6 main chars which you have to play through, badly you often have to repeat levels and this makes the whole game a bit monotonous. Another disadvantage of the game is the char Big the cat and his gameplay mechanic,  fishing. Badly the mechanic is explained awfully bad , so it is really hard to figure out how this works. This can be really frustrating. The DX-version of the game suffers also additionally of many "new" bugs that the original version did not have.\n\nConclusion: It is a real great platformer with alot of content.

His reason for doing so is destroying the city & building a theme park called "Robotnik Land" over the ruins because again, why not?\n\nSo you go after him in an attempt to stop him from destroying the city.  Along the way you find Amy being abducted by one of Eggman's robots so you go after her & eventually wind up on the Egg Carrier (which is probably the coolest hub in the game).  As you progress through the ship you fight a Robot called E-101 Gamma & just as you're about to destroy the foul creation of evil Amy stops you.  E-101 takes a liking to Amy for some reason & decides to no longer work for Eggman.  Gamma then goes on a journey of saving his Robot Brothers from Eggman's control by murdering them one by one.  Ah, brotherly love.\n\nEventually you fight Chaos & Robotnik a few more times & all is well. Until Chaos destroys the city & gains his final form Perfect Chaos. You then fight him as Super Sonic in one big DBZ style rip off & then the game ends with everyone (except all the dead & homeless survivors) living happily ever after.\n\nUntil Sonic Adventure 2.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nYou play as Sonic, Tails, Amy, Knuckles, E-101 Gamma, and Big The Cat.  You go through world hubs to get to levels and each level plays pretty terribly.  In the fast segments (Which are supposed to be the highlight of Sonic) you hit walls, can't control yourself very well, and sometimes you'll clip straight through the ground or through walls.\n\nYou unlock the extra characters by playing through Sonic's main story, and the extra character's levels are just rehashes of the same levels so it's just there to add replay value.  If you complete all the story modes for each character you unlock Super Sonic and fight the final form of Chaos.\n\nThere's also a "Missions" menu where you go around the world up fulfilling mundane tasks that were meant to unlock Game Gear games on the GCN but are now reduced to simple Achievement farming since the GG games are not in this version.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nIf you played this on the DC or GCN you're not missing much.  The game is pretty much an exact port, that somehow adds new problems and makes the older issues worse.  The graphics have been improved slightly over it's DC counterpart but are not as good as the GCN version and some areas are glitchy with texture clipping and shadow flicker, especially in Big's levels.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nGameplay varies for each character that you play.\n\nFirst thing you'll notice is this game has an overworld hub.  I dunno what they were thinking adding this to the game.  I guess they wanted the "Adventure" in the title to mean something, but the hubs are so small it's really a useless feature that only serves to take up space & add useless text dialog to manequin people walking around town.  In any case, you go to levels through these hubs but you usually have to solve some mundane puzzle first before you can get into each level.\n\nSonic's levels start as simple "run as fast as you can to the end" but later on they turn into slow platforming segments.  There's even one level where all you do is farm rings so you can buy an emerald from a casino.  This level used to have a running segment between all the ring farming but they cut that out for some reason which is kind of lame since that was one of the more fun parts in the game.  Every now and then you'll fight a boss which range from baby-mode easy to down right broken & frustrating.  Egg Viper is the worst boss in any Sonic game (or any game) ever, imo.\n\nTails' levels are a similar style to Sonic's except you're racing him to the finish & you have to beat him to progress.  Aside from new shortcuts everything is pretty much the same.\n\nKnuckles' levels are all about finding gem shards of the master emerald.  You go around each level with a Radar that tracks each gem.  Knuckles probably has the best game mode since you actually feel like you're on an "Adventure" & not some linear path.  Sadly, his levels also have some of the worst fixed camera angles in the game.\n\nAmy's Levels are comparable to Tails', except you're not racing to the finish but trying to outrun one of Eggman's robots.  Every now and then he'll jump-scare you & try to capture you.  Her levels aren't bad but they are slower compared to other characters.\n\nE-101 Gamma is a robot who shoots things with homing missiles.  His missions are mostly blowing stuff up & reaching the end of the stage.  At the end of each stage you'll fight a miniboss with the last 2 stages being real bosses.  Gamma's storyline is probably the best out of all the characters.\n\nThen there's, ugh. Big The Cat.  Big's levels are the worst in the game.  His pet frog ate a Chaos emerald & is now running away from Eggman's robots so you have to go after him & capture him by fishing.  Yes, they decided to put a fishing mini-game as a requirement for beating a Sonic game.  These levels aren't hard, but if you don't know the trick to catching Froggy they may take you some time.\n\nAfter completing every Story Mission you unlock Super Sonic, which let's you fight Final Chaos in Super Sonic's form.  It's mostly just Run as fast as you can & hit the boss 3 times.  Then the game ends.  Nothing too impressive, really.\n\nGLITCHES & ISSUES\n\nThere are still some parts of the game that I remember being broken on Dreamcast that are still broken in this version.  One of which involves riding a stone snake through a part of the Mayan level but Sonic is constantly fidgeting and clipping through the snake, or when you need to ride an elevator with Amy she will constantly clip through the elevator and drop to her death.  You'd think after almost 20 years they'd fix these glitches.\n\nThe biggest problem this game has is its camera.  It goes everywhere and nowhere.  It clips through walls, goes behind objects to obstruct your view and has set angles in certain areas that just make the game harder because of the angle it's forced into.\n\nVoice acting is bad but it's not the worst I've heard.  Sounds and music are decent.  The best song in this game is in the title screen.  Every character also has their own theme song which isn't too bad.\n\nThis version of DX also doesn't include the Game Gear games that the original Gamecube rendition has which is rather disappointing.\n\nOVERALL\n\nIn short, there are good Sonic games, there are bad Sonic games & this one is the latter.  You may want to wait for a sale of some sort before buying unless you really wanna feel some good old Dreamcast nostalgia.  Sadly, if you only played the GCN version you'll just be disappointed.","November 13, 2014","false","11.7"," 26 of 43 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","26","43","2","1"

Back in 1998, making all new Sonic gameplay, creating a character for Sonic and friends was huge task for Sega, and they've done it very well. One of the best 3D games ever, Sonic has so much freedom in movement, very nice control and precision, probably the best in all Sonic games. Very interesting plot about Dr. Eggman releases Chaos to defeat the world again. Side characters: Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Big and E-102 also quite interesting to play, and they offer different gameplays. The stages are very good, they are non-linear, unlike modern games, and free for discovering some stuff. And the best part of game is EPIC Soundtrack, I think it is the best in all Sonic games. Rock tunes along with techno beats and some folk music makes it so much fun to listen and adds even more fun in playing stages.\nMy score: 9/10. Sega made the first 3D Sonic game really decent. Yes, there are some bugs with camera and clipping walls, but in 1998 it was astonishing success.

It is pretty cheap here on Steam, and a game worthy to add to your collection. It may have aged a little poorly, and might have some glithes, but is still a very fun time. Heck, I have put 96 hours into this game since I got it back on December 2X, 2013. And don't think I am a nostalgia- blind knuckehead, as I had never played this game before I got it on Steam. Also, the cutscenes don't get too in the way, as there aren't too many of them, and they last an average of 30 seconds. And they are hilarious.\n\nPros:\n+Fun, fast gameplay\n+good level design\n+Doesn't drag out stages or hub world (perfect size)\n+Many fun playable characters\n+Hilarious, cheesy cutscenes\n+Fast load times\n+Price\n\nCons:\n-Poorly aged\n-Loose controls at times\n-Glitchy (especially with scripted sections)\n-Big the Cat isn't very fun to play as\n-Camera can be a pain sometimes\n\nFinal words:\nBuy this game if you love platformers.

Sometimes sonic even disapear from your screen each is awesome! Each character have a play style and own story! Levels are well design with some annoying seguements here and there, but over all the gameplay is diverse and fun. Sound is like EPIC!!!!! The soundtracks overall are really awesome.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dorroile/recommended/71250/","dorroile","Knight-hart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dorroile/","2201 products in account","While the Director's Cut of Sonic Adventure (Or, to use its proper Japanese name, Sonikku no Adobencha) ultimately improves on the original game, it is not without its flaws. For example, Knuckleboy the Enchilada is still plagued by an obscure, yet omnipresent rendering error that causes him to appear red instead of the intended yellow, which severely hampers the game's racial subtext - while he was supposed to represent the Asian continental subconscious, many now incorrectly believe he is the physical manifestation of Native American spiritual beliefs. There are also a lot of translation errors. Some of the more noticeable ones are when Sonikku tells Amy Rose (another mistranslation - her Japanese name actually translates to Horse Horse) about the numerous ghosts haunting his apartment, they use the word "ghouls" instead of "ghosts", which may lead the player to believe he is actually besieged by some sort of zombies. This can lead to some confusion down the line when his apartment actually DOES get beset by an undead horde, as many might believe he was already suffering from that problem, when the evolution from ghosts to zombies is supposed to represent him coming to terms with his bisexuality.\n\nHowever, at its core, this is still an excellent Visual Novel. While the sex scenes could use some better writing and voice acting, this is still a story that you owe it to yourself to experience.","July 15, 2013","true","0.1"," 27 of 48 people (56%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","56","27","48","8","2"

Sonic Adventure DX is the remake of Dreamcast's launch title Sonic Adventure and it's still considered the very best of Sonic's 3D carrier and for very good reasons.\nThe game actually haves a complicated story though not as good as Sonic Adventure 2's story (That game's story was fantastic). Instead of the classic old school "saving the forest and the animals from an evil dictator" this game actually haves Sonic interacting with humans for the first time and the story involves a lethal water-like creature possessed by Dr.Eggman called "Chaos" the only guy who can stop Chaos' rampage is the one and only Sonic The Hedgehog but this time he's not alone.\nIn this story every Sonic character takes the spot from the little flying fox Tails to the super strong Echidna Knuckles and even the little pink hedgehog Amy Rose from Sonic CD makes a return this time with a very different make up and also two new comers E-102 Gamma and Big the Cat.\nThe gameplay is basically (with the exception of Amy, Gamma and Big) the classic team's transition to 3D and because of that the characters have their old abilities only with new power ups and new skills like the homing attack and the light-speed dash\nThe controls are the best in any 3D game, the characters control just like they should and it's very helpful because this game is everything but linear as the hubs and levels are very big and while it's still "go from point A to point B" you never have to take a specific path because there are a lot of shortcuts.\nThe music is awesome and i'm my opinion one of the best of Sonic, the themes, the hubs, the levels and don't forget about "Open your Heart" which was very well composed.\nUnfortunately the game has problems like the voice acting and the cutscenes and the DX version includes tons of glitches that ironically weren't in the original version.\nOverall it's a great game and the DX version includes various extras like Mission mode, Metal Sonic and the Game Gear games (only in the original PC version and the GC) i suggest to give it a try.\n9/10","August 2, 2014","true","37.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I can understand exagerrated facial expressions and okay voice acting but I wouldn't expect any less, it was 1999, everything they used here was considered cool back then, e.g casino's snowboarding, beaches, robots, ("Sup, cool, whoa, alright, hey, damn") chances are we all use each and everyone of those words without thinking, criticism is unnecessary.  Gameplay now, an engineering feat in level design, when you platform it isn't jarring and is fairly fluid, controls respond contextually per situation and all enemies are well placed, although later levels require situational awareness e.g sky deck, egg viper.  Sonic as usual has a streamlined design, people who complained about slimmer build and green eyes just need to deal with it, you physically cannot have full black eyes(you'd be playing blind), or a stomach that large if you want to be able to run that fast and actually see.  Aesthetics are upgraded for characters but downgraded in certain places in the environment, won't take you out of the experience though.\n\nIn short, a game full of character and well designed, not to mention a soundtrack that pays homage to the Sonic style in more ways than one.  Definitely worth a buy.","December 6, 2015","true","28.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/muteKi/recommended/71250/","muteKi","muteKi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/muteKi/","441 products in account","I think as far as Sonic in 3D goes, the first Sonic Adventure got a lot of things right that games after it failed to grasp -- yes, even in the presence of 4 fishing stages. If you've come to think of Sonic in 3D as running quikcly across narrow paths crossing the abyss, you should at least go back over this game. Levels in this game have more variety in their structure, such as Ice Cap's  death-pit-free climb through a circular cave, or the almost Mario 64-like ascent up the Pleasure Castle of Twinkle Park. Part of the reason the levels work as well as they do is that every character has a slightly different way to play. For example: Knuckles' stages are all more open-ended and tend toward larger open spaces, while Tails' stages tend to be more straightforward runs of the faster segments' in Sonic's game. While people who are fans of Sonic mainly from Sonic 3 [& Knuckles] might find these changes in gameplay disappointing, I think they help keep the levels fresh. Since Sonic himself goes through nearly every stage and area on his own (including most of the open areas of Knuckles' game!), it makes completionism a bit less of a grind (although the less said about Big's missions, the better).\n\nThat all said, the camera is pretty bad, even now -- and it's probably the reason that the 3D Sonic games after this one tended toward less ambitious level design. This last playthrough I noticed an astounding amount of clipping; I assume this is an issue with the updated version, since while previous versions of the game (i.e., the Dreamcast or 2004 PC versions) didn't have this issue. This is still probably the definitive version of the game. Most of the important graphical effects are here, it runs at a stable 60 FPS on a modern gaming laptop, switching focus doesn't kill the game, and it can run at high-definition resolutions (in a forced 4:3 ratio, admittedly -- but the previous PC release only supported widescreen by cutting off the top and bottom of the screen). The game was rushed a bit to get it out in 1998 before Christmas so the Dreamcast had a killer app, and all versions of the game since (including the bugfixed Dreamcast releases put out for other regions, called the "International Edition" in Japan) have struggled to get a stable game out of it, and even in this recently-patched version many well-documented bugs are still hanging around. On the other hand, it's still probably a more stable game than Donkey Kong 64 -- and supports a wider variety of play interests than "wander around a big map collecting stuff".\n\nAnother minor frustration is the lack of cutscenes. While for Sonic's story that doesn't matter much (Sonic's story is defined mostly by the characters around him and he doesn't really develop as a character during it), the other characters all get to be a bit more complex and actually develop as indivduals over the course of the game. Gamma's quest of self-awareness, for example, has a surprisingly tragic end to it for a game about a fast talking blue hedgehog; it's not on the level of a game like Super Mario Galaxy, but it definitely had a lot of thought and heart put into it.\n\nThat's basically my summary of the game -- an ambitious but flawed game that definitely had heart in it, before sequel fatigue and shrinking budgets caused the level design to be formulaic and a bit on the bland side. If I were to recommend a 3D Sonic game other than Generations, this would be it.\n\nYou'd still do well to check out the Dreamcast release, however, as a few flashy graphical effects courtesy of the console's hardware shading never made it into any of the ports -- Sky Deck in particular has far more dramatic and foreboding lighting and shadows, looking a bit dead in comparison in the DX version. A shame, but these effects are rarely enough to spoil the game; the stable framerate and generally much nicer-looking textures more than make up for it most of the time. (And I suppose a patch to get the proper graphical effect in Sky Deck is not out of the question.)","November 30, 2014","true","20.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Is a classic for sure but even being a really Sonic fan, doesn't arrive to MasterPiece but is still a memorable game in Sonic, Sonic Team and Sega's Life. You can feel how the game is funny just for some buggs or faces that Sonic makes, that doesn't make any sense along what is saying at the same time. The story is simple and sometimes, no makes sense either. Yes, almost every detail in this game doesn't make sense.\n\nBut i love the gameplay of this game, accurately, the Sonic's story, is completely amazing, as Gamma's story. Tails's and Knuckles's stories are ok, Amy's story is a bit boring but...Big's story...omfg OMFG, is the worst thing than i have ever seen in my ♥♥♥♥♥ life.

It's done better.

Some things might confuse you the first go-round. If you don't want to mod your game than you should really choose another version of this. I recommend the Dreamcast or even Gamecube over this and the X360/PS3 ports, but if a PC is all you have then get it.\nSeriously though, get yourself a version of this one way or another.

But it's not quite the best either.\n\nPros:\n\n-Gameplay-wise, this is still the same as its previous incarnations.  Six playstyles available - Sonic has high-speed Action Stages, Tails' stages involve a "race to the finish" style with lots of shortcuts, Knuckles' stages involve exploration and treasure hunting, Amy's stages require you to outrun a robot that's constantly on your hide, Big's stages involve FISHING of all things (which I'll detail in the Cons later), and Gamma's stages revolve around shooting targets and getting through before time runs out.  Plus, there's a Chao raising system (just not as advanced as Sonic Adventure 2's system), so there's plenty of variety.\n\n-Sound is great.  The game's soundtrack is excellent, especially during the Final Boss.\n\n-Additional sub-games also provide more variety, including shooting targets while flying the Tornado, a whack-a-mole type game, and Boss Rush mode for all characters.\n\n-Unlike the console versions that were released, the Mission Mode and Metal Sonic are automatically included in this version, saving you a chunk of change.\n\nCons:\n\n-Big the Cat's fishing levels are purely designed to raise one's blood pressure.  Now, I'm not saying this in the terms of this version - I wasn't expecting a remake - I'm saying it in terms of ALL versions, including the GameCube.  This mechanic is broken beyond belief, and it just doesn't sit in with the rest of the play styles.  You'll be wrestling with Big's portion of the game for quite a while, I'll tell you that much.\n\n-Chao raising is fine and dandy, but the races will also raise your blood pressure.  One thing SEGA could've tweaked was the "cheering" system.  Unlike Sonic Adventure 2, which has a meter and only allows you to cheer for your Chao, this game has it  much more messed up.  You can only cheer for a Chao when it sparkles.  The catch?  9/10 times, the computer will pick an OPPOSING Chao for you to cheer for!  That's right, you barely get to cheer for your own Chao to propel it to victory.  So you'll really have to grind for small animals to jack up your Chao's stats, because you need to finish about 10 races to get five of the game's Emblems.\n\n-Chao raising, while it is a nice and cool break, is very hard to do so with Big (who lives up to his name) and Gamma (who can't go into water).  It's much harder to take care of a Chao with these two characters than the rest of the cast (who are considerably shorter in comparison).\n\n-Similar to Sonic CD, the controls are locked.  Unlike Sonic Adventure 2, you cannot change them (without modding anyway).\n\n-Unless you have the configuration mod available in the community, you'll have blue borders in full screen.\n\n\nIn all, I would recommend this game if you would like it for nostaligic purposes, or if you've completely new to Sonic Adventure.  8/10.","July 16, 2014","true","54.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But that just may be me basking in nostalgia. Unfortunately, this game hasn't aged all that well.\n\nStory The story is nothing really to write home about but here I am. A god of destruction, aptly named "Chaos" is getting it's hands on the Chaos emeralds, turning him into a more powerful creature, with the help off Eggman of course. And it's up to you as the player to stop him! Pretty straight forward\n\nGameplay Let's start off with the gameplay itself. It's your original Sonic game but remade onto a 3D plane, granted this already has been done before but this time SEGA acutally got it right. You get to enjoy the game not only from Sonic's perspective but from the perspective from other charaters such as Tails and Knuckles. Their stories are different obviously and occasionally do cross with one another. Even if you DO get sick from just "GOTTA GO FAST" then you can enjoy gameplay with Knuckles where you get to the monotonous chore of searching for Emeral shards in various levels that you visited as Sonic or run from a robt who's trying to capture you as Amy. Each character provides a lot of variety to this old game.\n\n\nGraphics The Graphics...are well...dated. But what can you expect from a game that as originally designed for the dreamcast so everything kinda looks like stretched lego figurines. The animation is alright, facial expressions can get pretty spooky at times where the character would should a face of shock and it would be a step by step revealing of their face contorting to show the emotion.\n\nLevels The levels are still just as enjoyable and varied for an old game. You've got one level where you running along a beach to save Tails and the next you're in a Casino trying to collect rings to build a high enough pile to get a Chaos emerald. Each level makes you feel like you're playing MORE than just a Sonic game. And to top it all off, you have a Hub world where you can run around and talk to other citizens that really have nothing to contribute to the game than just to breathe life into the world. As you run around like the rainbow colored animal you are, you can find permanent powerups that will assist you in the levels.\n\nIn the end, I recommend giving this game a try if you've never played but yet want to see where Sonic really hit home in a 3D game. Or you just want to relive some nostalgia from the good ol days when Sega wasn't continually destroying itself with each game they release","June 14, 2015","true","0.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sonic Adventure is surprisingly one of my favourite Sonic games may I say even as good if not way better than Adventure 2 and dare I say some of the 2D games aswell. This game was revolutionary for it's time (1998 in Japan) and here in the States when the Dreamcast launched in 1999. It may not have aged as well as some may like but for an "early 3D game" the graphics , sound , design and gameplay overall were completely fine. The transition from 2D to 3D may have not been as well received as some might've hoped but it really is hard to come off the success of Sonic 3 & Knuckles.\nThe models are really except the mouth movements are.....jarring to say the least. The music is overall nice especially the non lyrical songs but soem of those are catchy at least fitting even but a very "in it's time period" kind of thing. The story while pretty generic is interesting is some aspects and each of the 6 characters will have their slight alterations of the story and dialogue dependant on that specific character which adds a bit of flavor to it that Adventure 2 lacks and these 6 characters stories all intertwine at some point(s) too. Despite the human world setting alot of aspects of the game keep true and reference the classics for those of you who like that because sadly after this point I feel that Sonic lost it's way with that with trying to hard to fit into the new millennium and being "edgy".\n\nNow each of the 6 characters have different gameplay styles not gonna lie Sonic's IS the best but I expect nothing less from the gameplay of the title character. Sonic runs and jumps like you all rememeber from the older games along with new abilities too. His levels are also the best too which is good as his story is obviously the longest but the most straightforward trying to find and keep the chaos emeralds from Eggman. Tails plays similar to Sonic but can fly and hover in short bursts with his own little set of new moves. Tails levels revolve around races or timers so think of it like Sonic stages on a timer but he can also visit specific parts of the stages that Sonic cannot so not much to complain here for Sonic and Tails gameplay.\n\nKnuckles gameplay is basically finding pieces of the master emerald the locations are switched up each time you visit the stage but you are given a radar which keeps track of where the 3 pieces are in the stage. Unlike Sonic Adventure 2 you can use the radar to track each of the pieces all at once instead of one at a time. Some of Knuckles sections are vastly different due to the hunting nature of his gameplay along with his climbing ability he has from the games prior he also comes with his new abilities too. His gameplay is a nice change of pace from the other gameplay styles and doesn't bog down the game. Amy is a slower moving character who uses her unique hammer abilities to attack and jump to higher places. Her levels mainly focus on running away from a robot trying to capture her it's different from what we usually see in this series and while she isn't really important in the overall story besides Gamma's section really it's not a bad thing and I somewhat like her section the biggest downfall for her portion is I feel they could've done more with her "puzzle" sections or the sections where you gotta figure something out. Like more of the color cube sectinos or something alike it would've been nice.\n\nLet's get the worst part out of the way and that is Big the Cat while being voiced by John St Jon is a plus he has no importance on the plot except a minor detail involving his friend froggy. His gameplay revolves around fishing which isn't a bad thing per-say but in a Sonic the Hedgehog game? No just no. Luckily his 4 stages can be completed in like a minute each so his portion is the shortest he gets a few abilities/upgrades too surprisingly but yeah there you go we got fishing in a Sonic game. Lastly we have E102 Gamma which plays out similarly to other characters as far as stage design goes he is a bit slower and uses his gun to shoot down enemies and obsticles in his path. Very interesting gamepaly even if you wouldn't expect it in a Sonic game it is pretty fun and he has the best story in the game honestly and really gets into detail and the perspective of one of the tiny animals trapped in a robot which animals being stuck in the enemies has always been a staple for this series so it was nice seeing how Gamma's story played out as he went around "saving" his friends. Then after you beat all of these characters stories you will unlock a secret I mean we all know what at this point but for the sake of this review i'll leave the final portion of this game a surprise. Did I forget to mention you can play each character at your own pace? That is alot better than the forced playstyle and narrative's on the sequel. It's also nice that this adventure actually feels like an adventure with hubs to explore and find stuff and fun little mini games here and there to play.\n\nAll in all the game may not have aged well in it's 15+ years of release and it may very well not be a "great" Sonic game or game in general but it's a game that while some small portions may be lackluster the overall experience is a fun ride and well worth checking out for one of the last good Sonic games (not counting handheld titles) even if the PC version has some glitches here and there.","April 3","true","29.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kell_Pro/recommended/71250/","Kell_Pro","Kell","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kell_Pro/","182 products in account","Sonic Adventure DX review\n\nThe Good: Very, very, very, much.\nThe Bad: Try to find\n\nWell, well, we all know what happened to this fellow. It looked like the start of something new for Sega and Sonic after a shocking past, with Sonic Adventure garnering positive reviews and Dreamcast sale’s making a promising start. The cancellation of Sonic X-Treme and the subsequent death of the Saturn looked firmly behind them. Alas, it was not to be. The Dreamcast lasted less than two years as competition had greater developer support, and the release of Sonic Adventure DX in 2003 failed to stand the test of time in comparison to contemporary platform games. Yet few would have predicted many more years of mediocre releases, and I wanted to see what was wrong when a hedgehog that defined my childhood went 3D.\n\nSonic Adventure plot sees a fight over the possession of the Chaos Emeralds. Dr Robotnil, um, Eggman, in his quest for world domination, gets his flying fortress up and running and seeks the water-based God of destruction Chaos, after destroying the Master Emerald and attempts to exploit his power by finding the Chaos Emeralds. The events spark the interests of six playable characters in the game: Sonic and Tails aim to prevent Dr Eggman from getting his way while Knuckles the Echidna attempts to restore the Master Emerald he was protecting by finding the lost shards. Eggman’s secretly compassionate sidekick E-102 actually wants to free all his fellow robots from his control, Sonic’s girlfriend Amy tries to find her bird friend and Big the Cat keeps losing his frog companion, who has swallowed his lucky yellow Chaos Emerald.\n\nAlthough the excess of game characters has been one of many problems associated with the Sonic franchise, most of the other characters play quite well. Plenty of crossovers of other characters occur in the plot. Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Amy host fast-paced levels, with a few differences. Tails can fly, Knuckles has the ability to glide and Amy has a Piko Piko hammer. E-102 takes a slower pace, sporting a few levels to wade through and blast everything with a laser gun while Big the Cat is obsessed with finding his frog companion and whose levels are extremely dull.\n\nSonic Adventure was so well received at the time because everyone wanted the new Sonic game to be good, and also the graphical quality was unprecedented. Rolling onto the first level, Emerald Coast, it’s easy to see how it was impressive. To see spinning rings, trampolines, item boxes and Sonic’s signature spin dash dazzling in 3D certainly had me amazed at 9 years of age. Seeing Sonic running clear of a killer whale destroying a peer was the icing on the cake. It’s still a decent enough level, with the sun shining on the beach, lots of jumping around albeit occasionally hard to land. It’s a good first impression all round.\n\nAfter the first level the game’s biggest flaw emerges; relying on Adventure hub fields to find action stages. They serve no purpose other than to advance the plot and to get lost, and are littered with pointless NPC’s. There are a few of these: Station Square, Mystic Ruins and Angel Island; finding the odd clue from an orb to indicate where to be next. The plot is uninteresting thanks to appalling acting as well. Expression is limited, dialogue is sporadic rather than free-flowing and lip-synching is non-existent. There wouldn’t be anything wrong with a plot if it was acted well and didn’t need hub stages but the explorative elements shoehorn the game into something it is not, and should not be. Hub levels in the likes of Spyro the Dragon and Super Mario 64 suited the games spirit of exploring and collecting things. This does not work where core levels are fast and linear, A-B progression.\n\nThe core levels don’t get everything right either, being tricky for the wrong reasons. Irrefutably shoddy camera work, questionable design decisions and improperly assigned collision detection lead to deaths because of a design flaw rather than a flaw in the player’s skill. Sonic Adventure is actually quite a good game when thing’s work, demonstrating how Sonic could actually work in 3D. However, too many surrounding factors puncture a decent gameplay mechanic not only by level organisation but carelessness. This game is average not because it’s consistently ordinary, rather an aggregate of many good and many bad moments.\n\nThe flaws make you wonder about exploring the depths this game offers. Sonic Adventure allows you to train your own Chao creature, with the part reserved for the Dreamcast’s Visual Memory Unit ported over, almost like a virtual pet mini-game. His stats can be raised to improve his performance in races, and special Chao eggs can be found in the game. This PC DX version also features many additional unlockables such as a mission mode (which unlocks even more), hidden characters and the entire backlog of Sonic games on the Game Gear (although not on the Steam version). Missions are rather mundane though, such as collecting flags or transporting a man to the train station. A lot of the Game Gear games were initially poor and have aged badly also, and look nasty at a PC resolution. If you don’t want to get arrested for downloading and playing these Game Gear games on an alternate emulator, then this remains the only legal way to play these on the PC. But what I want to know is why the time taken to implement these needless extras wasn’t used to fix the game’s bugs?\n\nIt’s been an interesting insight into Sonic’s demise: a lack of polish in levels, badly acted plotlines and unnecessary adventure fields between core levels. Despite camera flaws action stages are generally good; levels remain fast, boss battles are challenging but fun and the linear formula has been converted rather well to three dimensions. Many aspects of the famed 2D gameplay are intact: collecting rings, busting badniks and avoiding spikes and traps. The graphics, although dated, are classic Sega-style bright and breezy, as is the somewhat cheesy soundtrack. It’s just a shame this was the start of a decade of rot for Sonic. This was certainly one of his better games in the decade and has enough good points for a Sonic fan to enjoy if you can ride out and ignore the dross, but others should take caution. A loop-de-loop experience of its own, at least it’s good to see Sonic’s showing positive signs of progress recently. 2010’s Sonic Colours scored well and the upcoming Sonic Generations looks very promising. Ignore the trolls, Sonic. I always had faith in you.\n\nThe perfect game... for fans of SEGA, Sonic anime "Sonic X", jRPG, platformer and consoles. And actually the entertainment for one evening. But for fans of the wonder. But the problems. But the miracle.","April 2","true","7.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

For those of you who haven't already clicked away or tuned out from this review, I assume you'll want to hear me out. Just so no one gets me wrong, I like this game. There are a lot of cool things about it. And I even think it has aged alright.\n\nSonic Adventure brings the Sonic universe into 3D with five different playable characters, each with their own adventure. There's some good variety. Sonic has the most levels and has the most freedom, as he can go as fast or slow as he wants in most of the levels. Not too much pressure, but lots of possibilities. He's also the most useful character in terms of his abilities. Tails' campaign focuses more on flying through rings and beating Sonic to the end of the levels. So basically, like races or time trials. Knuckles is looking for shards of the master emerald, which has him searching around levels freely rather than in a linear fashion. I really like this campagn because it lets you really appreciate the level design. Amy is running for her life in her stages, being pursued by Eggman's robots. It's a tense run to the finish. Big the Cat has the most unique campaign by far, consisting of a bunch of fishing levels. As much as people hate the character and his levels, I think they're a nice change up and a break from the action while still being somewhat involved as far as gameplay goes. And lastly, Gamma's levels are scrambling to get as much time as possible by locking on to targets. So there's a lot of variety as each character controls in their own unique way.\n\nIt's also cool how, even though this was more or less Sega's answer to Super Mario 64, it feels like quite a different type of game. Everyone's stories intertwine at some point and every character gets boss fights, even Big the Cat suprisingly enough. There's replay value for those of you who want to try and get all the medals, and that probably isn't easy but I didn't put myself through that so I can't say for sure. The music is cool, blening band songs with game music. The visuals are also pretty neat. Lots of cutscenes where were nice for the time. Honestly, I really do have fun with this game.\n\nWell if I like all this stuff about it... why am I calling it overrated? Because I hear how GREAT this game is, most likely by people who played it on the Dreamcast when they were kids. The game isn't great by any stretch, but it IS good. I have plenty of complaints. I know it's the director's cut but... there are too many cutscenes in this game. They aren't anything spectacular and don't add a whole lot to the game so having so many pads the playtime and breaks up the action a lot. This is also coupled with the issue that the open world aspects, as they're called, are merely just you running around mostly baren hub worlds with very little to do in them. There are some people to talk to but they are largely unintersting. There are a few things to find and a few places you can go, but most of the overworld is rather pointless. So, basically you have three sections of the game. Cutscenes, hub worlds, and actual levels. The actual levels only make up about a third of your playtme. That's a bit annoying and since going through the overworld and watching these cutscenes happen between pretty much every level... well... it kind of ruins the flow of the game. And Sonic games are kind of about flow. Speed, flow, rhythm. This is counter intuitive to what Sonic games are about.\n\nWhile characters all control in their own way and have their own missions, they tend to share the same levels. I guess it makes some sense and works in some cases. It'd be tough to win the races as Tails if you never played the levels before as Sonic. Exploring the levels in depth with Knuckles lets you appreciate stuff you may have sped through before. I guess even playing as Big is different since you are fishing and therefore looking for water more than anything else. But Amy and Gamma, on top of having such short campaigns, just play the same levels as other characters. It feels a little lazy after a while and having some new levels along with replaying other ones would've been a good idea. And speaking of Gamma... boy did I hate his campaign. Yeah, I actually thought it was WORSE than Big's. Why? Well, you see, Gamma is the last character in the spinning wheel. I completed the campaigns in that order. So by the time I got to Gamma... his playstyle was a step backwards and largely out of place. He's not all that fast, can't jump very well, and hit attack is locking on to multiple enemies with homing rockets. It's just way too easy compared to the rest of the game... boring even. It feels like it should be one of the first things you do, not the last.\n\nThe Chao garden... no I didn't forget. A lot of people love it. I'm sure it's a lot cooler if you had the Dreamcast or GameCube version because... well... you could do stuff with your chao on portable devices. But with this version, you're stuck training them the hard way... the long, tedious way. I just didn't enjoy it. It was boring for me. This isn't what I signed up for when I was looking to play a 3D platformer. It just seemed like there were more important things to do. You know... stop Eggman, get the shards of the master emerald... fish for my froggy friend. ANYTHING but feeding and petting my chao so that I can put it into races and cheer from the sidelines with seems to have little to no effect on the outcome whatsoever. It's all just an overblown and underdeveloped mini game that I have no patience for nor interest in.\n\nSo there you have it. It's not a bad game, it's just nowhere near great. I like it, but it has a lot of flaws. Also, this version doesn't sound like the best because of chao garden situation, and the GameCube version has extra games on it as well. This has achievements... I guess... and some capability for modding... but... it's really nothing all that special. I guess if you don't have a Dreamcast, a GameCube, or a backwards compatible Wii, then this is a fine alternative. It's $8. Is it worth that? Well... if you're a big Sonic fan, sure. If you're just interested... wait for a sale maybe. It's not real high for a big name title like this, but I can't help feeling you could wait and get it cheaper.

The game blew me away, and I loved almost every minute. The controls felt great, and the voice acting was just corny enough to make me laugh every time.\n\nAnd the game is still pretty good. But sadly, many parts of this game have not aged well at all.\n\nThe voice acting is still hilariously corny, and the graphics have held up pretty well. However, there are parts of the game that just drone. The minigames interrupting the story, such as the plane shooter segments with Tails and the Sonic pinball minigame, just get in the way of the core gameplay.\n\nAlso, the game does not support widescreen and has permanant blue bars.\n\nIf you can look past the problems, Sonic Adventure is a pretty damn good game. The level design is still pretty good, the music is catchy and memorable, and the core gameplay as Sonic is really fun. But sadly, it's issues and flaws have made the game unbearable for me, despite my nostalgia.\n\nEither way, it's still the same Dreamcast classic from over 15 years ago. It's fun, but don't be surpirsed if it's not nearly as great as you remember.","December 21, 2013","false","1.6"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","19","36","0","0"

Platforming of the highest order only hampered by the usual camera issues and some level glitches. Could have done without Big the cat and his awful fishing levels. Amy's gameplay is a bit ♥♥♥♥♥ but its far more bearable, particularly considering how well pulled of the rest are. The intertwining stories work brilliantly, particularly that of E-102 Gamma, and leave you with a sense of each individuals' perspective on the events. The loveable robot Gamma's levels are fun, not suffering from the slowing of the mech levels in SA2, and his story is almost tearjerking, especially at the end. 100% reccomended.","January 6, 2015","true","27.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Worst repurchase of a game i have ever done, In fairness, Its sonic adventure DX. I was under the premise, Steam was PC-Videogames Retailer, So i expected it to be the original Sonic Adventure DX release, just a bit more optimised with a few more options.\n\nNope, far from it. We instead get bars around the edges (Which can be annoying) Achievements that dont work (Apparently they are new and not fully implemented yet) and the worst thing to have happened is the new "update" broke the game entirely for me.\n\nNot that i can say, i was playing it properly. I already own the PC version of the game, it runs around 100-70% "flawlessly" meaning frame-rate drops in areas when alot of things are happening at once. Steam? 70% to 30%. it is unbelievably bad in frame-rate, this is on the same system. Also the graphics of the "non-steam" release, actually LOOK better than the steam version, its like someone went around the game, (namely sonic) and every polygon edge, make it not blend in at all. make it look as bad as you can.\n\nSonic Adventure DX for the PC, looked good, dispite me playing it at the lowest resolution and  graphical options. in order to get the steam version working for me (playable) was by a CUSTOM MADE modding tool, that allows you to change the graphics settings, just because the steam version DIDNT WORK.\n\nThen came the update from sega, and completely broke the game entirely, anytime i try booting it up, it crashes instantly.\nAnyone reading this, Do yourself a favour, and the rest of the videogame community, Dont do steam, Dont do the steam version of sonic adventure, its less than the original release.\n\ntheres no game-gear games (Which were quite nice given the fact, you got them as a reward for emblem collecting. Now theres no point because they are non-existant.\n\nthe game now looks heavily blurry just to give it a "HD" look, Its not HD, it DOESNT look good. I honestly dont see a reason to get this version, the PC release is far better, and evan that version was flawed by glitches (And yet its still playable) unlike the steam version.","September 15, 2014","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZHDINC/recommended/71250/","ZHDINC","ZHDINC","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZHDINC/","136 products in account","This is a very faithful port of Sonic Adventure DX to the PC, which is both good and bad. Good in that it'll be exactly how you remember it, but bad in that it'll be exactly how you remember it. This port brings no changes to the physics system, which can be sometimes janky depending on what you think the input should be versus what input the game wants, and the story still has the occasional odd moment that makes you wonder exactly why you are playing.\n\nThere is little issue getting this title to run on a Windows 7 machine unless you want to play full screen. The included configuration tool just doesn't work without adding a small registry key change that you can find in the Steam forums. Making matters worse, the full screen option is kind of a misnomer because the actual game play is boxed in by a border when playing on an wide screen monitor. I know the original game was meant for 4:3 displays, but it shouldn't take any effort at all to include varied resolution options on the PC (especially when the next game in the Sonic Adventure series has these options).\n\nAs for controls, a gamepad is certainly recommended, but it isn't unplayable without one. I actually found that I had an easier time lining Sonic up with lines of rings with the keyboard controls, but overall (considering this was originally a console game) it feels much more natural with a gamepad. This is the first fully 3D Sonic game, so the camera leaves something to be desired, but it doesn't impede gameplay most of the time. The camera is only a real nuisance when navigating the forest in the Mystic Ruins Adventure Field.\n\nLike I stated before, this is a faithful port, so don't go into this expecting any kind of extra missions or features. The game's page from within Steam shows Achievements, but they actually do not work at all as of the writing of this review.\n\nThe story is hit and miss. I imagine most will play this once and never play it again. There are problems with the pacing given the way that they divided it between six playable characters. You get to experience the perspective of each character's place in the plot at large, but this means revisiting some scenes multiple times. It helps that the dialogue is slightly altered when playing as different characters, but this doesn't shake the feeling of, "Been there, done that." Occasionally, the delivery of some of the lines is particularly narmy, but the voice acting is otherwise acceptable (though Eggman's character actually benefits from the over the top performance). The most egregious example of "Been there, done that" by far is through the credits. The game ultimately has an ending that wraps everything up, but you have to sit through the same unskippable credits after finishing each character's individual arc.\n\nThe levels are extremely linear and this may seem contradictory, but the level design is actually great. There is a nice variety of enemies and obstacles, and levels don't drag on for too long. The game has an excellent soundtrack, so you won't find yourself wanting to rush through the levels anyways. The fishing levels really aren't any fun, but they are relatively painless because you can skip straight to the objective of the level.\n\nAside from the actual stages themselves, the Adventure Field is an interesting way of organizing the game, but it can feel tedious at times when looking for items to unlock the next level. The few boss battles in the game aren't difficult at all, but neither were the ones in the 2D Sonic games. However, the more sudden variety of boss battles are a complete joke since the AI doesn't usually even get a chance to attack.\n\nDespite its flaws, I still recommend playing Sonic Adventure DX at least once. It may not be the greatest platforming/action game of all time, but it is a great effort by the Dreamcast-era Sonic Team. They manage to successfully capture the mood of the plot and platforming mechanics of the 2D Sonic games in this initial 3D Sonic offering.","August 22, 2014","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sonic Adventure DX is an updated version that was originally made for the gamecube which was a remake of the original game on the SEGA Dreamcast which can now be played on the computer, is SEGA's first 3D Sonic game in the canon and continuty of sonic games and instead of just playing as sonic in multiple levels, you can play as other characters new and old as they have different abilities and upgrades. Tails, sonic's good ole pal, can fly short distances and can do a spin attack. Knuckles, sonic's long time rival, can glide and climb up walls (similar to how he played back in the day's of the gensis) but doesnt run around in levels to reach a goal, instead he looks for pieces of the master emerald. Amy Rose returns from SOnic CD, but is now playable, she is equipped with a hammer that can make here jump farther at a certain speed but in each level is being chased and must get to a balloon. A fat Cat named BIg makes his debut in this game, but doesnt run quickly or does anything that's very usefull, he just fishes, for a frog. next up is a robot made by Dr. Eggman, and by far the coolest in the game, E-102 Gamma shoots and makes it to his robot brothern..... and kills them.\nThis game is apart of my childhood as its the first game I've ever beaten, but Big's the only reason that it's fine if you don't complete the game. 8.5/10. mostly becuase of big that fat♥♥♥♥ of a cat.","February 19, 2014","true","14.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's my favorite Sonic game, and considering that Sonic is my favorite game series, I guess this is my favorite video game, period. I'm not sure why I like it so much. It takes a little getting used to, but once you do, the simple objective of getting from point A to point B as fast as possible while smashing any robots that get in your way is surprisingly engaging.\n\nThe different characters give different takes on this core objective, and most of them are pretty fun (if not quite as fun as Sonic). The best would probably be Tails (beat Sonic or Eggman to point B), simply because he is so close to breaking the game that you can skip entire sections of the level without touching the ground if you're good enough. Gamma is pretty fun too, as the focus of his levels is essentially "blow crap up." Even Knuckles' treasure hunting levels aren't as much of a drag as they are in the sequel, and feature more opportunities for smashing robots (which you think should be a given; I mean, his name is Knuckles, for crying out loud). The only character whose gameplay is a flat-out failure is Big the Cat. In each level, he fishes for a frog. He doesn't run. He doesn't even smash robots. He just...fishes. It's stupid. But hey, at least his story mode is really short (as are most of the story modes, actually).\n\nAnd even though the plot is dumb, it's dumb in such a way that it's also cool and fun, and you may even get more laughs out of it than the more recent games that try to be funny on purpose (with mixed results). Oh, and there are also virtual pets called "Chao" in the game, too. I don't know what to say about them. I never really cared about them enough to actually play that part. Some people like it.\n\nAnyways, I'm not entirely sure why I like this game so much. I think it's the simplicity, the fast-paced energy, and the sense of "cool" it has, a combination that not too many games seem to have (not even other Sonic games, aside from the direct sequel to this one). Maybe nostalgia also has something to do with it. Whatever the case, I haven't really played a game like Sonic Adventure. It's not perfect, it may not be for everyone, but if a simple, energetic, and cool game sounds like something you'd like, regardless of a few faults, you might like to try this one.","April 19, 2014","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What you must MUST do is upgrade to Windows 8.1. If you already have 8, it is free to download. Just look for it on Google or in the App Store that's already on your computer.\n\nThank you SEGA for telling me what to do! I wish more people knew about this.\n\nSonic Adventure DX is a super fun game that definitely takes the cake for "Best 3D Sonic game" in my book. I loved playing it on the Gamecube when I was younger and when I found out they were putting on Steam, I couldn't be happier.\n\nOn my old computer (that had Windows 7), this game worked like a dream. If you have Windows 7 and want to get this, do it. It'll be worth your while... So long as you can figure out how to handle Sonic and company with your keyboard (some levels made me rage so hard but that's only because I'm crap with Sonic games on the PC).\n\nHOWEVER, if you have Windows 8, I suggest NOT getting this game. Here's why:\n\nI don't know why this happens, but I've read it happened to a lot of other people, including myself after I got my new computer... When you boot up the game, you'll hear the sounds and you can hear yourself going through menus but the window will stay black. There will be no visual anything. Apparently some customers made patches that were meant to fix this but it doesn't work for everybody and if it does work for you, you won't be able to play it through Steam and will have other little misc. problems.\n\nThe patch doesn't work for me (I've tried making it work twice) and Sonic DX crashes upon opening. But even if it did work I'd still be minged off. Steam and SEGA are responsible for making this game work. They shouldn't put it on their customers to jerry-rig the files to force it to work. And if it doesn't work for you, it feels like they're flicking you off because they haven't been paying attention to those of us who are having the problem. Yeah so the game isn't that big, so what? We still paid for it. We expect it to work regardless of what Windows version we have. Though I do admit that Windows 8 is garbage with compatability so it's not entirely Steam and SEGA's fault... But someone in any of those companies should be doing SOMETHING if it happens to more than just a handful of people.\n\nI don't know, it just seems really unfair to me and I wish someone was paying attention. I would be playing Sonic DX right now if it wasn't for this problem. But here I am ♥♥♥♥♥ing about it.\n\nI really hope someone fixes this... In the mean time, again, if you have Windows 7 and under, get this game because it's great. If you have Windows 8, I say don't. Buy yourself a Gamecube, a copy of DX for it, and play that instead.","January 31, 2014","true","17.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After so many years have I returned back to the game and completed it... And what a game.\n\nThis is absolutely a very great game and if you're a Sonic fan you should really try it.\n\nYou can not only play as Sonic, but as all the other knows Characters.\n\nHere is the Characters you can play as:\nSonic the Hedgehog\nMiles "Tails" Prower\nKnuckles the Echidna\nAmy Rose\nBig the Cat\nE-102 Gamma\nSome Characters has more missions than others.\n\nAll Characters has a very great gameplay and as always a great soundtrack. The soundtrack has always been a big part of the Sonic games. It always makes me happy to hear the soundtracks. Especially this soundtrack.\n\nThe story might not be the best, but you should really just enjoy playing as  your favorite Characters and enjoy the great soundtrack. The story is not bad, but it could be better. You will still be able to enjoy it!\n\nThe Voice Acting was also pretty great, I liked them all. The only thing I didn't like was when they talked, there was a delay between every sentence. But it was still great!\n\nThe really only bad thing I can say about this game is the camera. The auto camera is pretty bad and can give you problems with seeing things. The free camera is better to use sometimes, you can change it in the settings.\n\nAmazing game, it's really these 8 euros worth. 9/10\n","February 23","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/docscott16/recommended/71250/","docscott16","Scottish Doktah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/docscott16/","123 products in account","Let me preface everything I say here with this: I grew up with Sonic games. Sonic the Hedgehog on the SEGA Genesis was the first video game I ever remember playing. I've played nearly every Sonic game to date, both the good and bad. However, I will try to detail the workings of this specific game without the bias of nostalgia.\n\nSonic Adventure has really not aged well. It is wracked with glitches, some "guide-dang-it" moments, hard to learn controls, and character animations that really show their age. Taking that in mind, however, you should be aware that this was the first true three-dimensional Sonic platformer. But that does not excuse anything bad with the game.\n\nLet me start with the visuals. While the models and environments look good for games of the era, the animations are what really bring the games visuals down. The characters look very rubbery, and stretch in ways that look very unnatural, even for a cartoon styled game. However, this is only apparent during cutscenes, and most of the animations during the actual gameplay hold up well enough over the years.\n\nThe audio is pretty awful, to be frank. While the music still holds certain charm, the voice acting and sound effects really show their age in the worst possible way. While I understand that the game was essentially the first of it's kind, it's lip-syncing looks as though no one even tried. Honestly, the only redeemable part of the audible experience is certian music pieces. Open Your Heart, Sonic's Theme, and a few stage themes to be specific.\n\nThe gameplay suffers from age the worst in my opinion. I look back fondly to the gameplay during my childhood. Running with Sonic, flying with Tails, and exploring with Knuckles were highlights specifically. However, they do not hold up to the same degree. While the three I stated still have fun to be had, once you can learn the quirks of the control, the other three characters do not fall in the same boat. Amy is just awful to play as. She's slow and completely unfun. Big is frustrating beyond belief. Gamma, however, controls simply okay. Nothing stands out as awful, but just feels very out of place. The glitches associated with gameplay are very apparent. Falling through floors, and moving through walls are things many players can plan on experiencing.\n\nThe story is nothing too special. While Tikal and Chaos are vaguely interesting, every other character falls short. Sonic and Tails' stories are rather boring, and don't engross the player. Knuckles has a slightly more interesting story, but it feels as though it losing speed rather quickly. Amy and Big's feel laughably absent, as their individual stories impact basically nothing. Gamma's, while self contained, is actually the best of the game in my opinion. The final story is somewhat cool, but is over very quickly.\n\nSo, overall, would I recommend this game? Honestly, while I do not feel like it has aged well, I still consider most of it a decent game, especially of your a fan of the series. Even the gameplay has it's moments of pure fun.","December 20, 2015","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I never got in touch with the Dreamcast version and only experienced the DX Version every time i played this game. Back then, i didn't really mind this port/version, despite it's reputation, and i still think to this day it is not too bad. The entire gameplay is rather solid (except for Big and Amy most of the time), story wise it is one of the better ones in the entire modern Sonic Franchise with the most character development.\n\nBut this PC port is giving me a really tough time. Here, the downsides the DX version brought are even worse here, with bugs left and right, extremely bad camera issues, very weird controller mapping, audio errors and so on. I even had the problem at one boss fight that the entire fight got glitched and i couldn't finish the boss. After installing the fanmade Patch (which didn't work for me sadly) and uninstalling it, the fight suddenly went without problems. Needless to say, this whole thing still costed me 1-2 hours of my time and it was rather annoying.\n\nWhen the game works, it's the same enjoyable game i remember from back then, with usually short and very nice stages usually lasting 2-3 minutes. Every story is usually fairly short and you only have to endure Bigs lame fishing games and Amys slow as molases platforming for a short while.\n\nAlso the game offers a lot to do even after, but nowhere as deep or exciting as Sonic Adventure 2.\n\nSpeaking of said title, i can highly recommend the second game to this one hands down. The gameplay is better, the story and presentation are better even if it has more plotholes, it has tons more content and the challenge level is also higher. And for people who only play for the Chao Garden anyway, get SA2, the Garden is a way more enjoyable experience.\n\n\nIn Conclusion, i am not completely sure if i can recommend this or not. The normal game i can recommend without a doubt, it's still a pretty good entry in the Sonic Series even with it's downsides. But the Steam version is so unbelieveable broken at parts it really discouraged me to play further sometimes.\n\nGet it when it's on sale.","February 6","true","25.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/themanisinsane/recommended/71250/","themanisinsane","TheManIsInsane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/themanisinsane/","547 products in account","Sonic Adventure is a tricky game to judge. When it was first released back in 2001, it was loved by almost all. I myself have fond memories of playing it on the Gamecube. But some games just do not age well, and unfortunately, Sonic Adventure is one of them.\n\nThe game's camera often has a difficult time focusing on the characters and actions, thus making even the simplest of jumps an annoyance to be repeated again and again. The controls are also frequently difficult to work with, epsecially in situations requiring accuracy and a bit of finess. The story which is told from the perspective of several different characters is a boring and cliche-ridden droll, complete with events that often don't sync up. But it is admirable that it at least trys to present some character development and lore.\n\nThe game's highlights are its level design, which can truly be a joy to traverse through every so often, and to a lesser extent, its music. But neither of these traits are enough to make an enjoyable experience.\n\nOverall Sonic Adventure is a clunky and boring game that only has a few inklings of entertainment sprinkled thoughout its entirety. Unless you're a dedicated Sonic fan or just want to experience the character's first true foray into the third dimension, I wouldn't play this game.","September 5, 2015","false","18.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Freshmemesforsale/recommended/71250/","Freshmemesforsale","The Magical Dog-Bird","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Freshmemesforsale/","54 products in account","This game is a true platformer. I came across this beauty when looking for SA2 as I heard great reviews, and ooh, the Chao Garden. However, I got the games mixed up. I was super mad and felt horrible like I wasted money but as I got farther in as Knuckles I absolutely LOVED it. All characters have good mechanics, so you arent playing the same thing (but screw big and amy anyways I actually loved E-102 Gamma.) It has an good, explained story all set out but the chronological order of all the characters stories may be mixed up. The main characters, the main trio, the main pilots, the main people, the main players, the main i dont know, Sonic, Knuckles and Tails are where the story is mainly at. These characters have longer stories and more mechanics to them. You will love playing as these 3, but the other 3 not so much as the main. However, since the game was originally for the Sega Dreamcast some of the cutscenes are strange, with weird mouth movements and slow walking. However, this should not be a problem at all unless your a whiny casual, as the gameplay is better. As Sonic the Hedgehog, you go straight-out speedy 3d platforming, in many levels. As Tails, you race Sonic (and Eggman on the last level)  to get to the end and grab the Chaos emerald before Sonic does. (for Eggman, its to a rocket.) As Knuckles, you have to locate 3 Master Emerald pieces in very large sub-overworlds. You have to use your locater which will flash and change colors as you get closer, but can cause some VERY tedious moments. As Amy, you have to escape from one of Eggman's robots to the end of a level and grab an escape, using a Piko-Piko hammer as a weapon. As Big the Cat, you..... fish. Yeah, you just fish a frog out of the pond, Literally. Just go to a pond in a level and fish Froggy out. Seriously. Thats it. As E-102 Gamma you are one of Eggman's robots. You have to go through many levels where you shoot things like a 8-year old who just drank 10 5-hour energy drinks playing COD. The more things you shoot, the more time you get, and at the end you have to face another robot in the true levels. All these characters get atleast 2 powerups which can help them power up a default move, learn a new move or give them something to help finish levels better, in which some of these powerups are needed and some are optional.\n\nIn the end, you play as Super Sonic against the main antagonist, Perfect Chaos. You use the powers of the 7 Chaos Emeralds to defeat Perfect Chaos. As you progress through the skies, your ring counter goes down. You must keep it above zero or you will fail the level. This is a balance of fun and tedious, but mostly fun.\n\nIn the end, this is a great game for Sonic fans and just about anyone, especcialy platformer fans. I would totally reccomend and play for a very long time, as the levels have great replayability since you can do Mission Mode, Trials for medals, and replay levels for new times and scores. Overall, out of 10 I would give it a 9.\n\nAlso, in the end when you collect all medals, you get a Metal Sonic skin for Sonic.\nAwesome.\n","July 11, 2014","true","18.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

I recommend setting the camera controls from the bumpers to the right analog stick. The camera is still very sluggish compared to more modern titles, but it gets the job done.\n\nThe graphics haven't really been updated but there is support for HD resolution and it definitly looks better than before. Some 2D object don't handle this upscaling as well as the polygons but it has still aged very well!\n\nAbsolutely the best 3D sonic ever made!

It's just a port of the 2004 PC release, which is still much better. Until September 2014 (a few years after this port came out) the config wouldn't even save. Even now, the config is very limited and the game still runs in 4:3.\n\nNot only that, but Sega didn't do ANY graphical improvements. The 2004 PC release had some graphical downgrades cause of the limitations of DirectX at the time. Here's a video that shows examples: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiYretcgm8k Sega didn't "un-gimp" the game since the 2004 PC release so you still have that ugly, still water.\n\nBasically, Sega got really lazy with this port. They did absolutely nothing to make it worth purchasing on its own. The Sonic Adventure 2 2012 release was a much better done port.\n\nI only recommend getting this with the Sonic Hits Collection. By itself, it's not worth it.","August 26, 2014","false","21.5"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","0"

It is over a decade old. Sonic adventure was the most critically aclaimed sega dreamcast game scoring a 9.0 of 10 and was soon ported to the gamecube.In this game you take control of Sonic,Tails,Knuckles,Amy,Big,and a robot named E-102 GAMMA. Each character plays differently,Sonic has the classic get to the goal playstyle. Tails is racing sonic to the goal. Knuckles is trying to get the pieces of the master emerald to restore it.Amy is trying to outrun a robot. Big...well Big...he umm...fishes for a frog ( :P ). Gamma just flies around,shooting the heck out of things.This game is easily my favorite sonic game I give it a 9.5 out of 10 because there are a few plotholes.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that this game has aged.  It's obvious by now that the best parts about this game are the main trio's portions of the game. I'll go ahead and say this right now, the classic series are superior in quality in terms of gameplay. If you're into the nostalgic aspect, go ahead and give the game a try once again like you did with your Dreamcast, but if you're getting into the series, give it a go if you're willing to go for the whole game, because I can't guarantee you'll enjoy the entire experience.\n\nBad: The animation during cutscenes are sloppy and downright horrible. The voice acting is questionable as well. Amy's portions are slow and dull, Gamma is a shooting fest, and Big...... The story overall is meh. Each character has their own respected stories, but none of them are really that intriguing and the overall story focusing on Chaos is just executed poorly. Sonic gets Eggman with Tails, Knuckles finds the emerald pieces, Amy helps a bird, Gamma saves his fellow robots, and Big fishes. This all leads up to Eggman using a water creature that uses the emeralds to become huge and destroy Station Square. No, There's no need to use the /spoiler because in the end what really matters is everything else.\n\nGood: Sonic's gameplay is chock full of exploration and contains fast paced platforming. Tails and Knuckles are basically the same, they just have less stages. I don't mind the emerald hunting much in this game because it's done pretty well. unlike sa2 None of the stages between these three feel like a chore or take 50k years to finish. Also, this game gives Sonic the BEST control he's ever had in 3D. The music is AMAZING. I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE this soundtrack to death.\n\nBecause this isn't a full fledged review, I may be jumping the gun a bit here but, this game has aged. I can't guarantee that everyone will enjoy this game in the state it's in, but remember this is a decade old. The best parts are only half the game, and that can be a problem for some people. I say, if you've always been a Sonic fan like me, go for it, if you're getting into the series, go for Generations or even the Classic series, then come back to this if you want. If you're curious or just don't care, go for it, you may really enjoy it.\n\nTL DR; It may be ♥♥♥♥ for some people, but for others it may be a gem, it depends on your tastes. So go play a Sonic game unanimously considered good before you come back to this.","August 30, 2014","true","8.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

I bought this game when I first got my Dreamcast.  There of course is some issues with the game first off the bad camera angles and the game plays in a 4:3 cropped screen with a border.  Sega has also removed all the special content from this version of DX which was available in the original PC and Gamecube release.  Of course that content would be Sonic The Hedgehog Game Gear games and other minor content.   If you can get passed those flaws you'll enjoy this game. I of course had to share the flaws first cause that is what everybody looks for in a review.  The good points to the game though is this is the first Sonic The Hedgehog game in 3D.  The graphics were ahead of its time when the game originally got released for the Dreamcast.  Today it may not be as nice as most games but its still a good eye catcher and very colorful.    If you can get passed those flaws you'll enjoy this game.  There is different characters to choose from and each one containing their own story.  The game still has the speed of the originals and so much more have fun with the mini games as well.","September 15, 2014","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It can be beat in about 4-5 hours and is very enjoyable all the way through. You can play as other characters as you meet them in the main story, but after finishing Sonic's quest I was kind of burnt out. The writing is obviously generic and easy for kids to understand, but the cutscenes have a certain "throw logic out the window" feel to them.\n\nThis game is a classic and it's sequel is just as good and less buggy.

Time for Knuckles who unlike Sonic doesn't chuckle (what is with those lyrics???) Knuckle is fun he runs fast has smooth controls and the treasure hunting is really fun. Tails is another great charater. Though his voice can be a little irritating it fits him and his gameplay is racing agaist Sonic or Eggman/Robotnik taking shortcuts they can't take in shorter versions of Sonics stages and he is a lot of fun. Now for the name of the game Sonic! Sonic is without a doubt the best charater in the whole game becuase you feel free as you run around the stages you feel fast and the game gives a real feeling of adventure and freedom.

The PC disc version (the one I own and use) was a port of the GC version, and is good aside from a couple of glitches. Now, since then, the GC version has been ported to XBOX marketplace. Apparently it is this version which was ported to be on Steam. I am not usually one to complain when it comes to video games but this is just absolute garbage.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the lack of fullscreen (well, any graphics options at all). I mean, come on, that is something every single video game should have. I have played many completely unfunded indie games and not one of them I have played has lacked the most basic feature of being able to go fullscreen. The game itself is in a tiny resolution (taking up about 30% of my screen) surrounded by an ugly blue patterned border inside of a window, which is really, really offputting.\n\nThe next issue was controls. I plugged in my controller and all of a sudden, the camera was eternally rotating to the right, and there was nothing I could do. This was never an issue in the original PC port. In the end, I decided to use my keyboard as I did when I played through the game back when I was younger.\n\nAs you can tell, I didn't get very far. I promptly uninstalled this pile of rubbish and got out my original disc to use that instead. I would suggest you do the same if you want to play this amazing game: one of the best 3D Sonic games and a massive chunk of my childhood that was sadly ruined by one of the worst port jobs I've seen in a long while.","December 28, 2014","false","0.3"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

Many consider it the best sonic game ever. But i'll be honest, this PC port of the game is horrible. There are bugs EVERYWHERE.\n\nI'll start with the Resolution. a recent update allows you to change the resolution beyond 720p. This sounds great, but it actually breaks many graphics. Mostly with the UI and HUD. Some things will appear WAY too small and sometimes even appears in the wrong area. Even worse though there are flickering and even spazzing glitches that happen regardless of the resolution. Graphics aren't the only problem tough.\n\nMany sounds are also broken. Sometimes a sound won't play, even worse sometimes a sound won't STOP playing. I've especially had this issue in the chao garden when a chao goes swiming. Even when i get them out of the water the spashing sound plays on an endless loop. Twinkle park has volume issues as well. A lot of noises are either too loud or too quiet. You often can't even hear the music.\n\nI've heard this game has slowdown issues as well, i haven't really had a problem, but maybe that's because i have a pretty good PC. But a heads up just in case.\n\nOverall this really feels like a shoddy emulation rather than a true port. If you've played this game before and want a little nostalgia, you may be willing to handle it. But if you haven't played it before, i say skip it.","October 7, 2014","false","6.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It just trys to be something absolutly huge for the franchise, mixing dramatic storytelling with the rush of Sonic gameplay, and yeah, at the time and on the right hardware, this was revolutionary. Its just plain awful today.\n\nThe advancements in PC gaming make the attempts for story telling, and the technology used for this effect just laughable. Seriously, the developers of the PC version must have LOW expectations. Your first playthrough of this game (all campaigns) will be memorable for years to come, but not in a good way.  Why?\n\nBecause this PC port is complete ♥♥♥. Missing button presses was a frequent problem through my experience, no matter how many different keyboards and computers I played on. (tested on 5, btw) For example, During the final boss fight of Amy's campaign, during phase 3, I game-overed 3 times from full lives because of the missed presses. In the fight, you have to jump over an obstacle. In my experience, Amy jumped probably 3/4 of the time. Eventually I got so badly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at the game, I borrowed a second USB keyboard just to double my button presses.\n\nThis problem was only present in the Boss fights. There is literally no reason for this.\n\nWhy do I say thats its OK then? Well, Sonic Adventure DX is on the fence on being Good or Bad. The cornyness of the cinematics makes it funny and good, but only seconds later, a glitch where you are thrown uncontrolably off a stage by a pickup, losing a life and possibly game-overing you makes it bad. This effect (and unfortunatly glitch) happens frequently.\n\nIf you are curious, wait untill it's like $1 in a sale before you buy. Just the hours alone and ONLY the hours alone playing this game would justify that price. If you are on the fence, just don't.\n\nHere's hoping Sonic Adventure 2 isn't this broken.","May 1, 2015","false","22.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The Sonic X Japanese anime was based on the story of the 2 Sonic Adventure game and it has continued in Sonic Adventure 2, but lets speak about the game.\n\nThe Story\nAs I said it the Sonic X series was based on the Adventure Games. The plot is that there is a monster called Chaos who gain his power by eating all the chaos emeralds. Sonic and friends need to stop Dr. Robotnik alias Eggman who is trying to find all of the chaos emeralds to make Chaos invulnerable and with that power destroy Station Square and build a new place there called Robotnikland.\n\nGameplay\nThe game has 6 playable charachters know as: Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Big and E-102. All of it has differint gameplay style but the worst of all is Big the Cat. Sega is tried to show how awesome is the Dreamcast console so they added a fishing part to the game and to finish the game with 100% you need to clear that Story too. At the last story you unlock Super Sonic and if you finished collecting all of the emblems than you unlock Metal Sonic too. The camare physics is somewhere breaks so watch out with that.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe game has the good and old Crush 40 songs that every Sonic fan loves. I do not want to speak about this too much, try out the game or just listen to it you will know what I meant.\n\nPros: -6 characters\n-Level designs\n-Soundtrack\n-A game that adapts the animes Story (if you want the full check out Sonic Adventure 2 too)\n-The Dreamcast version and the 2004 port\n-Character design\n-Collectable upgrades\n\nCons: -The 2011 port of the game\n-Big the Cat\n\nI do prefer for everybody to try the game out and share it with this generation because they do grow up on Sonic games like Lost World and Sonic Boom. We do not want that, yeah Sonic Fans?\n\nMy scores for the is a: 7/10","December 16, 2015","true","26.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Finally I can say I did it. Another thing off of the bucket list\n\nIf you have never played this game, and are buying it just to buy it- remember this game is old. by today's standards the graphics are laughable. Seams are in plain view, and nearly everything is a photo-texture, one that repeats so much you might be reminded of a checkerboard looking at the ground. Round objects are only round in theory, so that tires may look more like bolts than wheels. The animation is odd, and looks like sonic is at all times dancing, or looking for his next drug fix like an addict on the street corner.\nBut, when this game came out, i remember how beautiful it looked. An early game in the 3d arena, this was at one time cutting edge. so give it some slack if you weren't around then.\n\nThis game requires you to play as the characters other than sonic to complete the game, and honestly like a lot of sonic games as of late in the sonic series you are kind of left wondering "why?". A lot of the other stories feel rushed and personally i find Amy and Bigs' gameplay to be unfun. Bigs plays as fishing simulator, and Amy is slow.... neither of these are reason i would play a sonic game.\nThe other characters aren't so much unfun to play as, as much as their stories, being somewhat of a repeat of Sonic's story,  seem redundant and you rush through them.","December 20, 2015","true","17.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Finally I can say I did it. Another thing off of the bucket list\n\nIf you have never played this game, and are buying it just to buy it- remember this game is old. by today's standards the graphics are laughable. Seams are in plain view, and nearly everything is a photo-texture, one that repeats so much you might be reminded of a checkerboard looking at the ground. Round objects are only round in theory, so that tires may look more like bolts than wheels. The animation is odd, and looks like sonic is at all times dancing, or looking for his next drug fix like an addict on the street corner.\nBut, when this game came out, i remember how beautiful it looked. An early game in the 3d arena, this was at one time cutting edge. so give it some slack if you weren't around then.\n\nThis game requires you to play as the characters other than sonic to complete the game, and honestly like a lot of sonic games as of late in the sonic series you are kind of left wondering "why?". A lot of the other stories feel rushed and personally i find Amy and Bigs' gameplay to be unfun. Bigs plays as fishing simulator, and Amy is slow.... neither of these are reason i would play a sonic game.\nThe other characters aren't so much unfun to play as, as much as their stories, being somewhat of a repeat of Sonic's story,  seem redundant and you rush through them.","December 20, 2015","true","17.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The Sonic X Japanese anime was based on the story of the 2 Sonic Adventure game and it has continued in Sonic Adventure 2, but lets speak about the game.\n\nThe Story\nAs I said it the Sonic X series was based on the Adventure Games. The plot is that there is a monster called Chaos who gain his power by eating all the chaos emeralds. Sonic and friends need to stop Dr. Robotnik alias Eggman who is trying to find all of the chaos emeralds to make Chaos invulnerable and with that power destroy Station Square and build a new place there called Robotnikland.\n\nGameplay\nThe game has 6 playable charachters know as: Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Big and E-102. All of it has differint gameplay style but the worst of all is Big the Cat. Sega is tried to show how awesome is the Dreamcast console so they added a fishing part to the game and to finish the game with 100% you need to clear that Story too. At the last story you unlock Super Sonic and if you finished collecting all of the emblems than you unlock Metal Sonic too. The camare physics is somewhere breaks so watch out with that.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe game has the good and old Crush 40 songs that every Sonic fan loves. I do not want to speak about this too much, try out the game or just listen to it you will know what I meant.\n\nPros: -6 characters\n-Level designs\n-Soundtrack\n-A game that adapts the animes Story (if you want the full check out Sonic Adventure 2 too)\n-The Dreamcast version and the 2004 port\n-Character design\n-Collectable upgrades\n\nCons: -The 2011 port of the game\n-Big the Cat\n\nI do prefer for everybody to try the game out and share it with this generation because they do grow up on Sonic games like Lost World and Sonic Boom. We do not want that, yeah Sonic Fans?\n\nMy scores for the is a: 7/10","December 16, 2015","true","26.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you're like me, Someone who grew up on the game and wants to revisit it, It's worth a purchase so you can give it a new home in your steam library and replay it for some nostalgic weekends.\n\nHowever, If you're a younger customer who's curious what the game was like, you're better off watching a review or playthrough of it. Most mechanics are annoying and time consuming to grasp, even for people who played it as a kid, So someone used to the pamperment newer 3D games have in design, this wonky old game will seem very broken and incomplete.\n\nSome of the worst issues are the camera, horrendous cuscenes (which seem to still be in 30fps, while the game itself runs 60) and obviously subpar graphics. As i said, if you want an idea of the adventure franchise, go play the Second game. The stories (from my memory) hardly converge anyways.\n\nAll of that said, i grew up playing the original version on the dreamcast, and picked up the DX when it came out aswell. I was not a smart child and instead of saving my games and consoles up, i traded them in for the next thing (it was the most cost effective for my family). That's why i felt i should pick it up for steam, and I'm happy i did. The memories rushed back, The only thing that could have made it better was if my older brother still lived here so i could watch him play.\n\nBut yeah. Game isn't great. It's a nice buy if you want to revisit the past.","December 1, 2014","true","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Why? Because of the garbage lip syncing, awfully slow cutscenes, re-used voice clips (GET A LOAD OF THIS), confusing gameplay and game-breaking glitches.\n\nMaybe that's what grants this game the appeal it seriously does not deserve. The "main story", which is supposed to be about the fastest thing alive, is so slowed down at many point in the game, where you are either forced to solve a puzzle, adjust some mirrors to let the light fall in the room or even just have to find a way around. Not to mention that most levels can eat up to ten minutes of your time if you cannot find the shortcuts. The other storylines are even more tedious. I have spent up to twenty minutes on a Knuckles level.\n\nYet, you'll love this game. It will remind you of older times, regardless of whether you played this game on the Gamecube or Dreamcast. There is absolutely nothing for it to come back, except history.\n\nP.S.

So what do we say about this game? Basically it is unplayable. The team that made this game wasn't writing code. They were using Infinite Monkey Theorem. You know the theory where an army of monkeys given enough time hitting random keys on a keyboard will eventually form coherent words and at some indescribable point in time will produce all of Shakespeare's plays? It's like that.\n\nI loved Sonic growing up. I wanted to like this game, I really did. But this is something else. This is what happens when you port a game without caring about the end product or the consumer. This is a giant metaphorical middle finger to everyone that has ever had a moment of joy in their lives while playing a Sonic game.\n\nIf you can get it to run you're off to a great start. Even better is understanding the control layout from the crappy diagram of an offbrand imaginary Sega controller when you plug in your 360 gamepad. This game has so many glitches it makes Duke Nukem Forever look like Star Citizen.\n\nI can't jump off of a spring or do a spin without falling through an invisible floor or getting bounced back to the beginning of the map. I mean I can. You can possibly play the game by memorizing every 256 possible glitches per level. Maybe you are a connoisseur of terrible games and it is in your blood to finish this game. You are a better man/woman/seal than me. However I cannot continue. I can't carry on with this because I have a life to live and we have to let go of our obsessions.

No dreamcast here, I didn't even know the game was a thing until I bought it on the gamecube and thought it was awful. Only after playing through half of it originally did I learn it was actually an older game ported and ""remastered"" for the gamecube, and then I excused it for some of it's faults. But in 201X, there's really no reason at all to play this game unless you are either a die hard fan of sonic/sonic adventure or you want to see a historical game showcasing where sonic started to go wrong.\n\nWhat is wrong with this game?\n\n-Awful Camera: The game's camera is bipolar and will sometimes be really nice to you and show you everything you need to see or jitter around and clip through the ground essentially putting your life in the hands of the level design\n\n-Level Design: Speaking of level design, it's bad. There are multiple paths to get where you want to go which is nice, but there are so many instances of the game giving you massive speed boosts only to stop you 5 feet later, or worse- kill you. It seems like the developers couldn't decide if they wanted you to go fast like traditional sonic games, or to make a slow platforming adventure.\n\n-Controls: Slippery and too fast. See level design. Play the Egg Carrier stage as sonic and cry as the controls rapidly change as the camera goes all over the place.\n\n-Big the Cat Stages: Even people who love this game can't defend these.\n\nDespite all this, not all is bad. Some of the levels are legitimately cool, I enjoyed the beach, casino, and temple levels very much. The ring dash is satisfying, and with upgrades, isn't annoying to use. Some characters here are really interesting, and while the robot isn't all that fun to play it's interesting to see a mech that has a machine gun in a sonic game.\n\nTL;DR: Don't bother buying unless you're buying it for like 1 dollar or you're a huge fan of the game","December 8, 2014","false","2.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Therefore my no recommendation may be a bit unfair.\n\nWith this said, I can not recommend this game.\n\nAt first I got this game because I had this random feeling that I wanted to play Sonic. As a child I remembered playing this game and enjoying it. I did enjoy the game a bit but for the most part the game annoyed me.\n\nLets start with the positive.\n\nThe music was not to bad. It is what you would suspect out of a game like Sonic. Some parts of the different courses were entertaining. The graphics seemed good for the time when it was made. The controls made sense and for the most part responded on a Xbox 360 Controller. Unlockable characters with their own content, although I have not delved into that content. I mostly played as Sonic.\n\nAnd for the bad...\n\nParts of the levels did not feel like your usual Sonic levels. For example they added some confusing exploring elements to them. I remember getting lost in a level not knowing where to go. The levels also got confusing because the camera kept getting stuck on walls and what ever else it could get stuck on. Also there was a lot of obstacles that I felt slowed down the overall pace of the level, which kind of annoyed me. In Sonic games I suspect to go fast not slow. Its fine to have obstacles to make the game harder this makes sense, but I felt like these obstacles were more there to just annoy you. Also, I have to mention the part of the game where I fell through, what I thought was the floor, twice... but maybe I am just losing my mind and really it was a hole... maybe. Like I mentioned above the levels were not horrible, some parts of it were enjoyable while others just annoyed me.\n\nThe boss battles were easy, at least the ones that I played. This made the bosses rather boring and although they sometimes looked really neat, the interest level slowly grinded to a stop with how easy the bosses were.\n\nThis part annoyed me the most. The overmap or what ever you want to call it. The map that you were on when you were searching for other platformer levels to play. This I thought was unnecessary. The game barely tells you were to go and your left searching for the next level or item by yourself. This is fine for rpg's but what's the point of it in a Sonic game? I just want to play the actual levels not go running around looking for the levels. To be fair, I am sure I just made a bunch of stupid moves, and the game actually did send me a lot of hints on were to go and I just missed them. But even if there is a lot of hints in the game. Why do you have to look for levels in the first place?\n\nOne point that I want to mention that counters the previous paragraph, is that the overmap stages are relevently small so you might not have as many issues with finding the levels.\n\nSo overall the game gets a NO from me. Its not a horrible game. Its an okay game that I would probably spend no more than 5 dollars on.","March 18, 2014","false","4.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Thanks to Humble Bundle, I got this version of Sonic Adventure DX for an excellent price. I wasn't sure what to expect. All I knew was that everybody says the Sonic Adventure games are the best 3D Sonic games.\n\nThey must have meant Sonic Adventure 2 specifically, because unfortunately (and I don't like saying this), this version of Sonic Adventure DX is nearly unplayable garbage...\n\nWitness the first Sonic wrestling game. In that you'll be wrestling constantly with the camera while it jerks around making you sick. Wrestle with the controls as you try to keep Sonic from running into every wall. Wrestle with your ears as they are screwed by the worst voice acting in a Sonic game I've ever heard. And wrestle with your own disappointment as you watch the game that you had so looked forward to for so many years crumble before your eyes. (Okay, so that last one was a little close to home)\n\nI'm so disappointed. Perhaps it's just this version of Sonic and the original Dreamcast or perhaps even Gamecube versions were better. But this is unacceptable. As far as best 3D Sonic game, I dunno, I was always partial to Sonic Heroes or Unleashed.

They have way too little inertia and just sort of fling themselves across the screen at the slightest tap of the control stick. Like, say you have Sonic running full tilt in the right lane of a city highway, and you see a line of rings coming up in the left lane. It's nearly impossible to change lanes; when you press left Sonic will either immediately make a 90 degree turn and plow into the guardrail, or, if you're lucky, he'll only make a 70 degree turn, still plowing into the guardrail but at least sort of maintaining forward momentum.\n\nThe hub worlds that connect the levels are pointlessly large and very boring. There are a bunch of little character arcs with the NPCs that play out as you go through the game, but these are all dull as dishwater, and while there are little character upgrades and hidden tokens scattered throughout, they aren't very hard to find, and when you do find them they don't particularly improve your character. It feels like that stuff was just included because other 3d games were doing similar things, but they never put in the time or effort to make those bits seem meaningful. It's also often very hard to understand where the game wants you to go next.\n\nThat said, I enjoy the level design, and while they'd be a lot better if you could actually control things, they have a lot of neat set-pieces and are still kind of fun to run through and explore. It's a game that's constantly on the cusp of being really great. I keep thinking to myself "This would be super fun if the controls and camera actually worked, if there were more hidden secrets in the overworld and better NPCs." But that's a lot of problems, isn't it?\n\nBasically, the central formula of the game is good, but the execution is lackluster at best and at a lot of points it's bad even for the time it was released, let alone 15 years later.\n\nIf you have Sonic nostalgia and you want to pick this up you won't end up hating it or yourself, but it's such a flawed game that I don't think it could really survive without that nostalgia.","May 21, 2015","false","43.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

About 10 times in the game. It's the same sound file too.)\n\n- Graphics are not quite as good as the gamecube, but good enough.\n- Tails gets annoying when he is following you around as sonic (This doesn't matter that much, because he's like a hologram :P)\n- Cutscenes aren't the best\n- You can drown in a swimming pool (Lol that's actually realistic :P)\n\nI honestly think this is one of the best sonic game you will find.

Yup, a 3D Sonic game. They keep making these and they keep hitting the same issues.\n\nDespite this being one of my favourite games on the Dreamcast back in the day, my opinion of game has been tarnished after a recent play through for the Backlog Blitz. Controls are horribly awkward and it feels like you're fighting against the camera angle most of the time. When you're not fighting against the camera angle, you're being sucked into walls or feel like your eyes are melting as the game's orientation warps, zooms and generally hates you throughout.\n\nGameplay wise you're probably looking at around 7 hours to 100% everyone's story mode, which isn't too bad. Probably even less if you know where you're going and what you're doing.\nThe game suffers from a slightly vague 'next objective' path - even though it tries to guide you with it's sutble ways.\n\nThe one saving grave this game has is the rather decent soundtrack, which I seem to remember being a real strong point throughout Sega games in the 90s.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend going out of the way to play this, but if you're a fan of the Dreamcast and are looking to relive 1999 all over again then this might be for you.\nOn the plus side the Chao Gardens are still in the game, so you can mess around with those guys for a little while... before you realise how creepy it is.","September 15, 2013","false","12.1"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","2"

It's a port of a Sega Dreamcast game starring Sonic.  That's pretty much the only good thing I can say about it.\n\nDespite it setting my screen resolution to a 16:9 widescreen (I have a 1280x1024 5:4 screen), the game itself is 4:3, and everything is boxed inside an ugly blue border.  The game didn't recognize my controller, so I was forced to play using my keyboard.  This game, ironically, has better keyboard support than Sonic Generations; all on-screen instructions were "translated" to keyboard controls, so I didn't have any issues there.\n\nThe game itself simply isn't very good.  The voice acting feels awkward, as though the actors were shown their scripts word-by-word and had to record the whole game in a single take.  The gameplay switches between decent Sonic platforming (albeit with bad controls -- I'll get to those in a minute) and bad pseudo-adventure gameplay where you run around like a caffinated gopher trying to find the next platforming section.  These "adventure" areas are confusing, badly designed (there are invisible walls everywhere), and simply un-Sonic-like.  At one point, I was teleported onto a weird island full of "Chao" with no way out except restarting the game.\n\nThe platforming segments, on the other hand, seem decently designed, but they're soured by horrible controls and camera movements.  3D Sonic requires an analog stick to work well, and since my controller didn't work with the game, I was stuck with the keyboard equivalent of a D-Pad.  Making matters worse was the camera; it moved all over the place, hid things from me, and sometimes messed up my jumps.\n\nAll in all, Sonic Adventure DX on Steam is a bad port of a bad Dreamcast game, and I would suggest giving it a pass unless you truly feel the need to own every single Sonic game in existance.","November 29, 2013","false","1.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

No full screen mode even after I select full screen in the configuration. It maxes out at 1024 x 720 resolution, which is fine since it's a Dreamcast game. The camera is shockingly bad. Like, seriously. It's bad. It moves all over on its own. It doesn't move with Sonic. The right analogue stick can move it a little, but seemingly only when stationary and then it switches you to first person but when you pan it doesn't float into a natural first person perspective. I felt a little motion sickness, so I threw in the towel. The controls aren't great either, but I think that's mostly because they're fighting against the camera all the time. It's just an awful game. Maybe it's just a bad port. I never played on Dreamcast.","December 22, 2013","false","0.3"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

The gameplay is good, but a bit aged now. The music is still fantastic. This was the first game to feature many types of characters with many different types of gameplay and minigames. Overall a nice complete game with many things to do.\n\nFor some reason the audio sounds a bit muddy compared to the original Dreamcast version, but most people will probably not notice it.\n\nExcept for a few problems. Out of the box, this game has some issues for many users where the configuration tools don't work and gamepads don't work. For most laypeople, this is nothing something that is fixable on their own. Thus, I have to give this and every game in the 4 game "Dreamcast Collection" a negative. Sorry, Sega. I loves ya, but you have to make your game run right in order to sell it. An extremely small post-release patch is all I'm asking just to make it so we can set full screen mode and have it keep.","December 12, 2013","false","0.1"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

(I'm playing on a Superclocked 3GB 660 Ti, definitely not my hardware when I run Crysis 3 on Very High/Ultra @60fps).\n\nCamera changes often glitch and change multiple times on turns, and often leave you unable to actually see your path while the camera is changing.\n\nControls are not responsive or consistent, a small tap left sometimes turns you, then other times will only drift you you slightly left - then you'll hit a corner and you the same small tap does the full turn... wot?\nIt appears as though your speed effects this, and I have a feeling the FPS is linked with the pysics calculations - creating the issues with the camera changes and random FPS drops. Attack and interact are the same button, very touchy with when it decides you have hit the button for which reason.\n\nDead spots. The maps are loaded with deadspots. This means you can be within bounds and have your character get stuck inside/behind things. You will have to quit. This happened multiple times while trying to complete just the first level.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, I did not play the original, so I can not determine if this is an extremely poor port or if the game is truly utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. (lol steam bleeping out the word boll ocks)\nHere's hoping it's just a bad port, as I know a lot of people are die-hards for this game, and I hope they are able to find a means to play the original game in a manor that is functional.","January 16, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You will be forced to watch the credits roll 7 times (and before you think you can just reset your game to skip them, think again, you will be forced to repeat the last mission for each character if you dont watch the whole credits roll). You will also need to deal with a painstaking camera, which will cause you many cheap deaths. Regardless, this game is fun. You are able to use 6 characters, though Sonic's levels are the longest and have the best level designs. Each character has a unique twist in their gameplay, so there's variety. The game has a fitting music, which are mostly cheese-like guitar riffs. The color palette chosen for the game was appropriate: The characters are colorful, with mostly bright colors. This fits with the lighthearted story, and an overall targeted for a child audience. Doing homing attacks to robots it's fun. The game runs at mostly 60 fps (though you may need to turn some graphic options off depending on your computer, even for an old game). The game will take you around 10 hours, which are mostly fun, though it has some padding and repetitive cutscenes. The game's aesthetic fits this game just fine. The music also improves the whole easygoing feel of the game. The gameplay is kept simple (move, jump, and attack), which suits just fine with this game. Perfect gift for a 10 year old, retro gamers, or any sonic fans. Reccomended if you enjoyed: Sonic adventure 2, sonic heroes, and Sonic Generations.","December 28, 2014","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really like SADX and I do not like SA2, deal with it.)\nThis game.\nOh yeah, good old Adventure DX. We all know it. 5 heroes (With the exception of Big he's pretty much useless), different quests, all leading to the same ending. Dramatic moments, suspense, battles with Robotnik/Eggman and plenty of speed. Just everything a 3D Sonic game should have.\nBut now, let's talk about this port.\nAs usual, yeah, you got it: It's a cheap Xbox 360 emulation by yours truly, SEGA.\nOf course, you got it's glitches; you got the purple borders; you got even new glitches. But you should do like how I do: Ignore these facts and play the game. It's freakin' SONIC ADVENTURE, for God's sakes!\nTo the game itself, I can easily rate it 9/10. It's a fantastic game, the gameplay is great, the soundtrack is amazing just like in any Sonic game and the story is pretty cleverly done.\nTo this lazy half-♥♥♥♥♥ port, I'll have to give it a 5/10. It is SADX indeed, but it is also the worst port ever. I'm not saying this out of pure "fan opinion", I played the 2004 version already. Compared to it, changes in here are quite easy to notice.\nKeep on, SEGA, keep on. At this rate you'll turn into Capcom and abandon your main franchise. I know this port was released a while ago, but by the looks of it, I can easily say SEGA hasn't changed a bit...\nNonetheless, I recommend this. If you'd like to have a more establishing port, get the original 2004/2005 PC port. Just play this game, it's bloody amazing.","July 14, 2013","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

Omg, I remember freaking out in my Dreamcast days when I woke up the next morning and saw my abomination of a Chao rebirth. I raged harder like no other. >:(\n\nWhen I saw this game go for a $1 with the Dreamcast collection along with 2 other Sega games, I was stoked, and bought the bundle without hesitation.\n\nUpon starting it up for the first time, I was....\n\nWait, what's up with the fugly vertical bars on my screen?\nWhat? No widescreen??\nAnd what's this? Texture hiccups!?\n\nWow, this game is complete ♥♥♥ from last I remember this.\n\n...that is, until I decided to get the "Better SADX" mod.\n\nAllowed me to play the game widescreen, has slight texture enhancements, and has the option to toggle between auto and free camera mode. Don't know about those modes, since they can still play terrible in either mode, but whatever~!\n\nThese small changes really helped me enjoy my experience with SADX, and I still look forward to continue playing it, while having my fiancee relive the nostalgia with me.\n\nPersonally, SA1 was always better than SA2 for me by leaps.\n- No Speedracer-paced dialogue.\n- No "suddenly, I'm here!" level placements.\n- No...weird...looking mouth movements.\n- No character gameplay re-hash.\n\nThough...I would agree that SA2's gameplay (with Sonic/Shadow anyways) were very well done versus SA1. But seeing how SA2 was so short, repetitive and had awkward progressions, it's not really something I'm too keen in going back to playing, unlike SA1.\n\nSA1's gameplay isn't as polished, but damn does it give you a good time (as much as it can) playing through everyone's stories.\n\nSo yeah, enough badgering of the sequel.\n\nSo does this live up to the nostalgia?\nWhen you have the mods...yes. You cannot play this game without doing this game justice. Make it widescreen, fix the minor graphical glitches and you're in for a treat.\n\nWhat? You can't get steam achievements if you mod the game? Whatever.\nI'm not here to get achievements; I'm here to re-live my childhood, dammit!\n\nAnd it's just how I remember the gameplay for every character I played.\n\nGamma is awesome.\nBIG is eh.\nAmy is cool.\nSonic is okay to eh.\nKnuckles can ♥♥♥♥ off.\n\nTails is the way.\nTails is life.\n\nTails is undoubtedly the best character to play in this game, just like how he has always been since Sonic 2.\n"Hey Sonic, you can run fast? Yeah, ♥♥♥♥ that. I can FLY!"\n\nTails was always the best to me not just because I can twirl him like no other, but man, he was (and is) just so fun to play. He's fast paced, can shortcut levels like a beast, and can bboy harder than Knuckles' theme.\n\nHell, even his interaction with Eggman just seems so much better than Sonic's campaign. Eggman's dialogue towards Tails, significantly feels more threatening than he does towards Sonic, as if Tails was the one to fear.\n\nThis game should have been called "Tails Adventure + SO (S.O. = significant others)."\n\n...what?\n\nOh yeah, the game.\n\nSo yeah, it has its ups and downs like how you remember it to be, but this game is still a force to be reckoned with, and I'm glad I bought this game along with NIGHTs, which I'm also looking forward to playing after my thorough playthrough with this one.\n\nIf you don't care for achievments, find and download the "better SADX" mod.\nYou won't regret it.","December 3, 2014","true","32.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is fun don't get me wrong, but one must be in the state of mind of nostalgia to enjoy it fully. Having owned the original Sonic Adventure for the DreamCast and its port to the GameCube. This is a lesser version of the Gamecube one. There was a Pc port that was exactly the same as the Gamecube version of SADX, though why they decided to cut the extra content I assume to "save cost" or "have the orginal expereince" i.e. not give the player a bunch of free game gear games that they could sell you indiviually instead. It looks nicer than the orginal port to PC and GC though, but third party apps generally don't work for this version. SEGA tried to release this on PSN and XBOX live as Sonic Adventure and you had the option to buy the DX dlc. That was bull ♥♥♥♥. Not buying the DLC would not give you the original DC game, just a chopped up version of it same as the Battle DLC in SA2. Owning both the DC and GC version of both I can tell you niether game will give you the original DC verion by ignoring the DLC. Fortunately SEGA wised up to see that was BS for this version, but sadly not for SA2. I liked the game though so if you liked old crappy DC games this is for you.

Those of you who have bought the game with intel graphics cards like me and regret it, let it be known.\n\nThe worst part about this is, Sonic adventure was, and is still a good game. (Experience from Xbox-360 version) Though there are rough patches, most of the gameplay is great, and the level design is good. The graphics don't hold up well, but it doesn't burn peoples eyes out, so I think we're ok. The soundtrack, like most other sonic games, is memorable and catchy, and fits with the level motif's very nicely. Story is forgettable, get chaos emeralds, stop robotnik, and other "bad guys", same old scenario. Chao garden was fun but I could never get very involved with it. Overall, it could be a nice game if it worked on more than HALF of the PC's that people purchase it on.\n\nAgain, SA is not a bad game, but buy it at a retro game store or off of amazon for an older console if you can, it will work, and you don't end up paying a company for a broken product.","December 25, 2014","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a real adventure running through the hub trying to find something or unlock a stage. Sonic has 10 stages while the rest have 5 except for Big who has 4 in addition to  the perfect Chaos final boss (which is not a spoiler because it's in the opening!). That would be 35 levels in total. the base world for the level is always the same with different challenges for every character. Each character has a unique goal the have to do to complete the stage which keeps the levels very different for each character which can keep you really busy (especially Big's story because his stages were the hardest). The extra mission are challenging as well and once you finish all of them you get to play as Metal Sonic which is pretty rewarding since the only time you see him in the main game is in a tank.","December 28, 2014","true","40.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not only them but some new characters have been included such as Chaos the blue creature that accompanies Eggman, Tikal who has a mysterious connection to Knuckles, E-102 Gamma a former robotic minion of eggman, and Big the Cat a new mainstay. Ironically this is also the first Sonic game to include human characters who are nothing more than NPCs but a nice addition to the otherwise barren world that would of been if there werent any. The enemies of the game are completely new with some being a replacement for this 3D adventure which is a nice touch.\n\n• GamePlay: 8/10\no Sonic Adventure DX's gameplay is very different from the usual 2D Sonic games that people have played for years before this game came out. The type of gameplay also varies depending on who you are playing as. In the case of Sonic you have the usual running through stages just like the older games however in 3D view. Some of the other characters you play as include Tails, Knuckles, Big the Cat, Amy and E-102 Gamma who have a alternate type of playstyle such as Tails who mostly tries to catch up to Sonic, Amy who tries to get away from a captor, E-102 Gamma who tries to find a exit or pod to release animals, Big the Cat who's levels are just fishing levels, and Knuckles who looks for 3 crystal shards of the Master Emerald. The characters all have same points of areas to explore however the level design and goal for each is different. Each character has his or her own storyline with their own set of cutscenes and boss battles. By completing each and every storyline will get you the chance to unlock an additional secret story which takes you to the conclusion of the game. Throughout the game you will find powerups for characters which will assist them in their adventures. The gameplay is also similar to any other Sonic game as well such as collecting rings to keep you alive as well. However unlike previous Sonic games, exploration is key to the game and you'll be exploring a majority of the time for certain points of the game or for certain items.\n\n• Graphics: 7/10\no Sonic Adventure DX's visuals have greatly improved from the older sonic games. It seem like Sega couldnt at first figure out how to make Sonic in 3D after a few failed attempts but it seems like they finally got it right by completely changing the usual art style they have had for the series. The series seem to be pushing more forth a teenage like audience rather than the usual child audience they have been catering too - despite that they managed to maintain the same content they have had for years but bringing a fresh new look. The visuals are quite amazing for its time with the overall world being fully detailed such as in a GTA like game. The character models are also well done and the animation is quite nicely done with a few rough edges here and there but that was mostly because this was the Sonic team's first full attempt at making a full fledged 3D sonic game. Despite that fact even though it has been years since the original game's release and technology has far improved it doesnt seem like Sega had any intention to improve the overall visuals as the game pretty much is the same as it has been since the beginning.\n\n• Sound: 7/10\no Sonic Adventure DX uses the same sound effects from previous sonic games when breaking a pod or collecting ring but it also includes several new effects thanks to the departure from the 2D landscape to the 3D world. Along with that for the first time the Sonic series now has voice overs for characters which gives a nice touch to the overall storyline. However despite nice additions, some of the voice acting can be pretty unbearable such as Amy's voice but other than that nothing seems too forced.\n\n• Music: 10/10\no Sonic Adventure DX uses a completely new style of music more of a rock/indie rock type themes rather than the traditional industrial type of music that the series has used for quite a while. Along with that there seems to be some pop music added and along with that several vocal tracks for boss battle and character themes. Overall it is one of the best OSTs in the Sonic series.\n\n• Length: 7/10\no Sonic Adventure DX so far is the longest Sonic game, there are over 5 characters to play as with their own respected storyline, the exploration in the game adds more to the length and you get the additional storyline once you finish all other character's storylines. Overall a decent length for a platformer, this game should take you somewhere between 10-15 hours at the max.\n\n• Replay Value: 7/10\no Sonic Adventure DX lets you play stages again if you want and also includes a boss battle mode where you can fight against the bosses again. Unlike the previous sonic games where you would have to play the games all over again, you can just go back to the specific area and play that level again depending on who you play as. Of course you are also free to restart a storyline from the beginning without actually having to explore around for powerups.\n\n• Player Value: 8/10\no Sonic Adventure DX is an amazing addition to the Sonic the Hedgehog series. The game has revolutionized the series with its new look, new and expanded gameplay, groundbreaking visuals compared to older games, a decent change to the music, and a well developed storyline that revolves around each and every character with their own role in the storyline. The only main complaint is Sega's lack of work on the PC port - you are gonna have to search up some fixes for the resolution since Sega was too lazy to do an actual decent port of the game. Other than the resolution and window size mistakes, the game is pretty good.","December 30, 2013","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is a lot of fun and by far one of the best Sonic games ever made.  There are six (or seven if you count Super Sonic as a separate play style) characters to play as.  Sonic is a really fun character to play as with intense speed and great action.  Tails is fun to fly around as and is very fun to control.  Knuckles is the third fastest character in the game and plays just how he did in Sonic 3 and Knuckles; he can climb walls, run fast, and glide.  He overall is a fun character to play as.  Amy is an all right character to play as.  She isn't that fast, but she controls well.  Big is the only bad character in the game.  He is slow, serves no purpose to the plot, and fishing with him is UNBEARABLE!  E-102 Gamma is my favorite play style out of the bunch.  He may not be as fast as the other characters, but it is fun busting up Badniks with this awesome fighting machine.  This may not be the best Sonic game, but it is certainly my 19th favorite video game.","December 15, 2013","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was fast, had you running through loop-de-loops at probably the speed of sound. In 1998 in Japan, Sonic Adventure released for the NTSC-J Dreamcast. If you think the old games were fast, this will blow your mind. In 1999, Sonic Adventure International released in America and Japan. It had LOTS of bug fixes, because it was rushed to the Japanese market. In 2003, Sonic Adventure DX released for the GCN and PC. This is the verson I'm reviewing now. This 2011 version has lots of annoyances such as the border, but nevertheless the game is still that classic in 1999. However, I installed BetterSADX, (the mod) which gets rid of the border and installs all the Game Gear minigames that released in the 2003 release but left out in 2011. However, No matter what version, I highly recommend this game. I love this game more than Sonic Unleashed (Xbox 360, PS3).

A 24 year old mascot.\n\nTo say I wasn't a SEGA fanboy would be an understatement. I mean, sure, Sonic was the first game I was introduced to, but I was 4 at the time and didn't really understand it. At the age of 15, however, I finally got to play those dreamcast and genesis classics thanks to steam.\n\nSo, SONIC ADVENTURE DX. A good game? That depends. How do you like your Sonic games? Do you like running fast and boosting to win? Then go get SONIC GENERATIONS. Looking for a classic 2D Sonic game? Go and get SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 4: EPISODE I/II. Do you want to try out a classic Sonic game that brought the blue blur into the third dimension? Then get this!\n\nWith a simple storyline of Eggman (It's Eggman, America. EGGMAN!) trying to take over the world (well, more like Station Square) with a mythical being. He seems to be doing that a lot lately...\n\nAnyway, the game is split into 6 different stories: Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy Rose, E-102 Gamma and... *Sigh* Big the cat. Although I haven't completed the game, I've still enjoyed every single part of it, except from the jungle hub. That place is confusing! Each character plays through a portion of the levels, Sonic getting through the most with 10, and most of the others with at most 5. Each character plays smoothly and is easy to control, even Big the Cat, though I find his levels irritating.\n\nUpgrades are scattered around the hub world, allowing for more abilities to be available. These are useful, though some are fairly useless.\n\nAlthough the game is fun, it hasn't aged well at all. But try it, see whether you like the way 3D Sonic used to play, especially if you are a younger Sonic fan who hasn't experienced those dreamcast titles.\n\nVerdict:\n\n+Solid gameplay\n+Outstanding Music\n+Responsible for the blue blur and friends getting voices and getting into the third dimension\n+Some extra graphical tweaks compared to the standard version\n\n-Can be slow at times with the secondary characters (e.g. Big, Amy, E-102 Gamma, though speed can be reached eventually)\n-Glitchy camera (as most platformers have)\n-Big the Cat\n-More graphical fixes could have been added, considering this is the director's cut.\n\nA Chaos 6/10\n\nP.S.

This game both reinvented and refined what a Sonic game felt like, and it was quite amazing at the time. Going back, this port doesn't seem to pretend it wasn't a Dreamcast/Gamecube game, everything brought over intact as it originally was. This isn't a problem in most cases, but widescreen users will be quite disappointed to find that you just get a big border around a small square in the middle of the screen. Mods can fix this, but it's a little sad they have to.\n\nThe sense of speed is quite impressive, and the 3D environments hammer home for the first time just how completely insane the architecture in Sonic's world (I still call it Mobius) is. This is for the better, especially on ridiculous levels like Speed Highway (a loop-filled highway built between skyscrapers, high above the city) and Windy Valley (tornado debris in the sky forming a chain of floating islands). There are plenty of "woah" moments where the camera pans and shows you the whole stretch ahead of you, and no level of pop-in dampers that effect.\n\nIt's not just Sonic you play as, though, and that's where the problem may come in. Sonic just runs through his stages, but Tails has to race against an opponent to the end (adding a nice challenge to Sonic's levels), Knuckles searches for pieces of the Master Emerald (a fun treasure-hunting game in one open area per level), Amy runs from a pursuing robot, E-102 has a shooting/platforming mix heavy on combat, and Big has... SEGA Bass Fishing. It's really just a port of SEGA Bass Fishing. Somehow, even this manages to be quite entertaining, but your patience may run dry on it if you're just in the mood for speed. Each character has their own story campaign, with one last one unlocked when you finish the rest, so you can sink plenty of time into it without replaying anything.\n\nThe open-world missions are more of a novelty than anything, but it's nice to be able to wander around as you like and see what the townsfolk have to say. The soundtrack is pretty freakin' amazing, as you'd expect from the series, with a distinct, jazzy sound to it. A lot of tracks are remixed from Sonic 3D Blast and other prior Sonic games, a practice that's continued even up to Sonic 4.\n\nIn short, I'd recommend this game heartily to anybody even remotely interested in the Blue Blur, or 3D platforming games in general. Cool boss battles, hammy acting, and crazy levels make for quite the Sonic experience, and the crew makes their transition to 3D quite naturally.","March 6, 2014","true","24.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(a lot less if you played this game before and want to speed run through everything) Each characters has their own set of goals and gameplay. let me breifly explain them all;\n\nSonic the Hedgehog;\n\ngoals: get to point A to point B\n\nMiles "Tails" prower:\n\nGoals: get to the end of the stage before your opponent does\n\nKnuckles the ecidna:\n\nGoals: treasure hinting\n\nAmy Rose:\n\nGoals: Run away and escape\n\nE-102 Gamma:\n\nGoals: reach the end or defeat the boss at the end while keeping the timer from running out\n\nBig the Cat:\n\nGoals: fishing\n\n\nNow for some unknown annoying reason, the Config will not save any settings at all. I tried everything to get it to work, but it won't. I wounder how hard is it for SEGA to actually make the Config work for the Steam version. and my last complaint about this version of the game is the blue box the surround the game screen.

A 24 year old mascot.\n\nTo say I wasn't a SEGA fanboy would be an understatement. I mean, sure, Sonic was the first game I was introduced to, but I was 4 at the time and didn't really understand it. At the age of 15, however, I finally got to play those dreamcast and genesis classics thanks to steam.\n\nSo, SONIC ADVENTURE DX. A good game? That depends. How do you like your Sonic games? Do you like running fast and boosting to win? Then go get SONIC GENERATIONS. Looking for a classic 2D Sonic game? Go and get SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 4: EPISODE I/II. Do you want to try out a classic Sonic game that brought the blue blur into the third dimension? Then get this!\n\nWith a simple storyline of Eggman (It's Eggman, America. EGGMAN!) trying to take over the world (well, more like Station Square) with a mythical being. He seems to be doing that a lot lately...\n\nAnyway, the game is split into 6 different stories: Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy Rose, E-102 Gamma and... *Sigh* Big the cat. Although I haven't completed the game, I've still enjoyed every single part of it, except from the jungle hub. That place is confusing! Each character plays through a portion of the levels, Sonic getting through the most with 10, and most of the others with at most 5. Each character plays smoothly and is easy to control, even Big the Cat, though I find his levels irritating.\n\nUpgrades are scattered around the hub world, allowing for more abilities to be available. These are useful, though some are fairly useless.\n\nAlthough the game is fun, it hasn't aged well at all. But try it, see whether you like the way 3D Sonic used to play, especially if you are a younger Sonic fan who hasn't experienced those dreamcast titles.\n\nVerdict:\n\n+Solid gameplay\n+Outstanding Music\n+Responsible for the blue blur and friends getting voices and getting into the third dimension\n+Some extra graphical tweaks compared to the standard version\n\n-Can be slow at times with the secondary characters (e.g. Big, Amy, E-102 Gamma, though speed can be reached eventually)\n-Glitchy camera (as most platformers have)\n-Big the Cat\n-More graphical fixes could have been added, considering this is the director's cut.\n\nA Chaos 6/10\n\nP.S.

Sonic's gameplay is a fast-paced platforming, Tails' gameplay is also the same as Sonic, only to beat him actually, Knuckles' gameplay is finding the scattered emerald pieces, Amy's gameplay is run away from one of Eggman's robots, Big's gameplay is to fish for it's friend, Froggy, and E-102 Gamma's gameplay is just based on the level tells you to shoot. All of the gameplay is fun, but Big's and Gamma's story are very short, nothing to worry about. The only problem is the camera. Yeah..... I don't wanna talk about it.\n\nThe music is one of the greatest in this game. You just need to hear it for yourself, after you buy it.\n\nThe environment is great even with it's aged graphics and so on, but who cares?  =D\n\n\n\nOverall this game is great.

The problem is, however, that it didn't run at all. It crashed upon startup. So, naturally, I played it on my Xbox 360, because, again; it would NOT run on my computer! I played it on my 360, and it was alright. I'm sure that for the time that this came out in, it was as realistic as it got, and probably pushed their standards a bit. The story could've used some work, as I don't see why you would be racing down corridors to chase villians that were obviously right there in the cutscene, practically taunting at you. The controls were a bit wonky, if you'd move any direction, whoever your current character was would just jerk to aeformentioned direction, without any animation.

Of all the versions you can purchase, do not get this one. It's a waste of money.\n\nWhy is it worse than the Dreamcast Version? The textures are more washed out and lower resolution. The controls are horrendous. The camera is worse. And finally, it's buggy as ♥♥♥♥. I fell through the scenery more than once in the meager time I've played. I've also gotten stuck in walls.\n\nIf that doesn't turn you off, let me go into more detail. The controls are absolutely irredeemably bad. Specifically it's the way the analogue stick works. I don't think it's actually analogue. I think they programmed it so you could use the arrow keys to control Sonic and forgot to program a proper analogue stick. So even when you use a controller it's like using a D-pad. Couple this with the terrible camera and the game is nearly unplayable, it'll get stuck behind walls and it whips around violently from time to time which will make it more difficult to control Sonic. Sonic is controlled by which angle he's being looked at by the camera.\n\nTo be fair, even when this game was on Dreamcast with better controls and graphics the gameplay was mediocre.","April 13, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was fast, had you running through loop-de-loops at probably the speed of sound. In 1998 in Japan, Sonic Adventure released for the NTSC-J Dreamcast. If you think the old games were fast, this will blow your mind. In 1999, Sonic Adventure International released in America and Japan. It had LOTS of bug fixes, because it was rushed to the Japanese market. In 2003, Sonic Adventure DX released for the GCN and PC. This is the verson I'm reviewing now. This 2011 version has lots of annoyances such as the border, but nevertheless the game is still that classic in 1999. However, I installed BetterSADX, (the mod) which gets rid of the border and installs all the Game Gear minigames that released in the 2003 release but left out in 2011. However, No matter what version, I highly recommend this game. I love this game more than Sonic Unleashed (Xbox 360, PS3).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BasilZero/recommended/71250/","BasilZero","Basilicious","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BasilZero/","900 products in account","Game: Sonic Adventure DX\nGenre: Adventure\nDeveloper: Sonic Team/SEGA\nSystem: Steam (PC)\nTotal Score: 84/100\nValue Score: 8.4/10\n\n• Story: 10/10\no Sonic Adventure DX's storyline takes place mostly in a area within a city named Station Square. One day a institution was being attacked by a strange blue creature who eventually was defeated by Sonic who was near by the area. One event led to another and Sonic found himself on a new journey to defeat Eggman who he finds out is responsible for the blue creature. Eggman is planning to take over the world again with the help of the blue creature who seems to be mysteriously powered up by the chaos emeralds. Sonic and friends must go through their own trials and tribulations to unravel the mystery of the blue creature and the unknown visions that each of them have been having throughout this adventure.\n\n• Characters: 10/10\no Many new and old characters return in this new adventure. Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Eggman and Amy from Sonic CD makes a return to the series already making the game the biggest cast of Sonic characters. Not only them but some new characters have been included such as Chaos the blue creature that accompanies Eggman, Tikal who has a mysterious connection to Knuckles, E-102 Gamma a former robotic minion of eggman, and Big the Cat a new mainstay. Ironically this is also the first Sonic game to include human characters who are nothing more than NPCs but a nice addition to the otherwise barren world that would of been if there werent any. The enemies of the game are completely new with some being a replacement for this 3D adventure which is a nice touch.\n\n• GamePlay: 8/10\no Sonic Adventure DX's gameplay is very different from the usual 2D Sonic games that people have played for years before this game came out. The type of gameplay also varies depending on who you are playing as. In the case of Sonic you have the usual running through stages just like the older games however in 3D view. Some of the other characters you play as include Tails, Knuckles, Big the Cat, Amy and E-102 Gamma who have a alternate type of playstyle such as Tails who mostly tries to catch up to Sonic, Amy who tries to get away from a captor, E-102 Gamma who tries to find a exit or pod to release animals, Big the Cat who's levels are just fishing levels, and Knuckles who looks for 3 crystal shards of the Master Emerald. The characters all have same points of areas to explore however the level design and goal for each is different. Each character has his or her own storyline with their own set of cutscenes and boss battles. By completing each and every storyline will get you the chance to unlock an additional secret story which takes you to the conclusion of the game. Throughout the game you will find powerups for characters which will assist them in their adventures. The gameplay is also similar to any other Sonic game as well such as collecting rings to keep you alive as well. However unlike previous Sonic games, exploration is key to the game and you'll be exploring a majority of the time for certain points of the game or for certain items.\n\n• Graphics: 7/10\no Sonic Adventure DX's visuals have greatly improved from the older sonic games. It seem like Sega couldnt at first figure out how to make Sonic in 3D after a few failed attempts but it seems like they finally got it right by completely changing the usual art style they have had for the series. The series seem to be pushing more forth a teenage like audience rather than the usual child audience they have been catering too - despite that they managed to maintain the same content they have had for years but bringing a fresh new look. The visuals are quite amazing for its time with the overall world being fully detailed such as in a GTA like game. The character models are also well done and the animation is quite nicely done with a few rough edges here and there but that was mostly because this was the Sonic team's first full attempt at making a full fledged 3D sonic game. Despite that fact even though it has been years since the original game's release and technology has far improved it doesnt seem like Sega had any intention to improve the overall visuals as the game pretty much is the same as it has been since the beginning.\n\n• Sound: 7/10\no Sonic Adventure DX uses the same sound effects from previous sonic games when breaking a pod or collecting ring but it also includes several new effects thanks to the departure from the 2D landscape to the 3D world. Along with that for the first time the Sonic series now has voice overs for characters which gives a nice touch to the overall storyline. However despite nice additions, some of the voice acting can be pretty unbearable such as Amy's voice but other than that nothing seems too forced.\n\n• Music: 10/10\no Sonic Adventure DX uses a completely new style of music more of a rock/indie rock type themes rather than the traditional industrial type of music that the series has used for quite a while. Along with that there seems to be some pop music added and along with that several vocal tracks for boss battle and character themes. Overall it is one of the best OSTs in the Sonic series.\n\n• Length: 7/10\no Sonic Adventure DX so far is the longest Sonic game, there are over 5 characters to play as with their own respected storyline, the exploration in the game adds more to the length and you get the additional storyline once you finish all other character's storylines. Overall a decent length for a platformer, this game should take you somewhere between 10-15 hours at the max.\n\n• Replay Value: 7/10\no Sonic Adventure DX lets you play stages again if you want and also includes a boss battle mode where you can fight against the bosses again. Unlike the previous sonic games where you would have to play the games all over again, you can just go back to the specific area and play that level again depending on who you play as. Of course you are also free to restart a storyline from the beginning without actually having to explore around for powerups.\n\n• Player Value: 8/10\no Sonic Adventure DX is an amazing addition to the Sonic the Hedgehog series. The game has revolutionized the series with its new look, new and expanded gameplay, groundbreaking visuals compared to older games, a decent change to the music, and a well developed storyline that revolves around each and every character with their own role in the storyline. The only main complaint is Sega's lack of work on the PC port - you are gonna have to search up some fixes for the resolution since Sega was too lazy to do an actual decent port of the game. Other than the resolution and window size mistakes, the game is pretty good.","December 30, 2013","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now, Sonic Adventure was released in 1999 for the Dreamcast and, in 2004, it got a remake for the GameCube and PC, entitled Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut, the game this port claims to be. At the time, this game was great, with great soundtrack, great level design, great visuals (well, the DX version at least), great gameplay and an all-around great fun. Nowadys, this game is still great, though unfortunally a bit dated. The fact that this game is dated doesn't bother me in the slightest, as this game is very nostalgic for me and I really wanted to replay this, even knowing that it was dated, but the fact that this game is dated may affect some newcomers, as they might be bothered by this game's faults. That's not to say this game is bad nowadays, no, far from that, it's still a great game, though it's now easier to see this game's faults.\n\nNow, to the port. I just have one thing to say about this port, and it is WOW! Just...just wow. To me, it's just incredible the fact that they menaged to do such a port... It's terrible. Why you might ask? Well, they removed half the stuff from DX (including the Game Gear games, WHICH WAS THE REASON I BOUGHT THIS GAME TO BEGIN WITH), didn't fix any glitches (if anything, they added more), removed the option to play in 16:9 widesreen without the use of those purple boarders, made impossible the change of the controls when using the keyboard (which makes your camera spin around like crazy when you're peting your chao, WHICH REALLY PISSES ME OFF), made a configuration tool WHICH DOESN"T WORK WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE COMUNITY and they also removed the option to choose the japanease voices. And the fact that it's so bad baffles me, as the 2004 version, an older version, does NOT have ANY of this port's faults. I'm not even joking, the older and clunckier port is actually BETTER than the newer version. IT JUST BLOWS MY MIND. And, do you know what's the worst thing about this port? No? Well I'll tell ya', IT"S BARELY SADX AT ALL!!! WHY? Well, as I said, they removed half of the new features from the original SADX, like the Mini Game Collection, which had ALL of the Sonic Game Gear games! So, you're paying for Sonic Adventure DX, but uou're only gettng HALF of what you're paying for! This is a disgrace. Seriously, if you can find it, buy the original 2004 version of SADX for the PC or GameCube, that is the best version.\nSo, do I recommend this? Well, if you've never played Sonic Adventure and don't care about all the features that were taken out, then this is a good version to check out. But, if you're a Sonic fan and wants to relive your memories of this game, then I'd recommend the original SADX versions, as they're far supperior. I'm only gonna mark this game as recommended because it's still Sonic Adventure...\nAlso, SEGA, FIX THIS GAME!!!","May 10, 2014","true","28.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sonic Adventure features wonderful graphics for it's time as well as one of my favorite Sonic soundtracks to date. The game brings hours of gameplay even to a Sonic Advenure pro and for new-comers it's story and the amount of enjoyment any Sonic fan will get out of this carries more than it's weight.","January 20, 2012","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Poor old dreamcast bit the dust. Luckily Sega gave us some of the fun dream cast titles on steam! (Where is Jet Set Radio?!?! SERIOUSLY!).  You will need a guide to finish this game if you hadn't played before. It is a classic 3D platformer. The PC controlls suck so plug in the trusty 360 controller & give it a go! You won't be dissapointed. A main complain however, lies in the inability to make the game full screen. The forums found a fix for this so you don't have to play it in windowed mode. Message me if you want the fix, it is REALLY easy. I totally recommend this experience with a controller. ~PR0XIDIAN","September 25, 2011","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aceawesome96/recommended/71250/","aceawesome96","AceAwesome96","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aceawesome96/","132 products in account","I first played this game about eight or nine years ago on the PC version (before it was released on Steam) and I enjoyed it as much as I still do to this day. I enjoyed playing through the game a second time after getting it on the Steam sale this year alongside childhood favorite, Sonic Adventure 2 (with Battle DLC, because I used to own the SA2:B game on the Nintendo Gamecube).\nSonic's stages are what you'd expect from the fastest hedgehog alive and these have transitioned quite well from the side-scrolling days of the Sega Genesis. They are a blast to play through, if you're used to the PC controls, in which case, you will learn how to play -or fail- rather quickly. Since Tails has always been my favorite Sonic character, I've always found his gameplay to be my favorite. It is one of the more stressful stories to play through, but once you get the hang of how his levels work, it becomes more fun while retaining its challenge. Knuckles' story is all about finding pieces of the Master Emerald, as his gameplay is a treasure hunting game. It's actually kind of fun, and is a nice diversion from the other stories. Amy is one of my least favorite stories in terms of gameplay, but as a character arc, it does some much-needed development for her character. Gamma is actually an enjoyable experience and is the non-Sonic-Tails-Knuckles story that I enjoyed the most. Then, we have Big. I'm gonna be totally honest here, it's not that bad. It's kind of relaxing and was the fastest story for me to complete.\nThe narrative is, well, very easily subject to opinion. I thought that the story connected all of the characters well enough. Most of the characters do get some great moments and some good character development. Of the six characters, I'd have to say that Tails, Amy, and Gamma get the best of the development (not in any particular order). Sonic is still at some of his best here too, so don't worry about that. Oh, and before I conclude my overly-long review, I should mention that the soundtrack is fantastic. Everything fits in some way and is pretty memorable; it is easily one of the best soundtracks in the Sonic games.\nAlthough, one of the only negatives is that the cutscenes can get really narmy thanks to some very laughable rigging and lip-syncing on the characters. Also Dr. Eggman's "I can't believe this!!!" line is something that you'll probably hear so many times over that it will be something you hear in your dreams/nightmares for the rest of your life. It's like Mass Effect's "I will destroy you!" of gaming before that took over as the most annoying thing you'll hear a hundred times in a video game.\nOverall, this is one of my favorite Sonic games of all time, and for good reason. If you haven't played it, you should give this game and its sequel a shot. Trust me, they're worth it.","November 22, 2015","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A 24 year old mascot.\n\nTo say I wasn't a SEGA fanboy would be an understatement. I mean, sure, Sonic was the first game I was introduced to, but I was 4 at the time and didn't really understand it. At the age of 15, however, I finally got to play those dreamcast and genesis classics thanks to steam.\n\nSo, SONIC ADVENTURE DX. A good game? That depends. How do you like your Sonic games? Do you like running fast and boosting to win? Then go get SONIC GENERATIONS. Looking for a classic 2D Sonic game? Go and get SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 4: EPISODE I/II. Do you want to try out a classic Sonic game that brought the blue blur into the third dimension? Then get this!\n\nWith a simple storyline of Eggman (It's Eggman, America. EGGMAN!) trying to take over the world (well, more like Station Square) with a mythical being. He seems to be doing that a lot lately...\n\nAnyway, the game is split into 6 different stories: Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy Rose, E-102 Gamma and... *Sigh* Big the cat. Although I haven't completed the game, I've still enjoyed every single part of it, except from the jungle hub. That place is confusing! Each character plays through a portion of the levels, Sonic getting through the most with 10, and most of the others with at most 5. Each character plays smoothly and is easy to control, even Big the Cat, though I find his levels irritating.\n\nUpgrades are scattered around the hub world, allowing for more abilities to be available. These are useful, though some are fairly useless.\n\nAlthough the game is fun, it hasn't aged well at all. But try it, see whether you like the way 3D Sonic used to play, especially if you are a younger Sonic fan who hasn't experienced those dreamcast titles.\n\nVerdict:\n\n+Solid gameplay\n+Outstanding Music\n+Responsible for the blue blur and friends getting voices and getting into the third dimension\n+Some extra graphical tweaks compared to the standard version\n\n-Can be slow at times with the secondary characters (e.g. Big, Amy, E-102 Gamma, though speed can be reached eventually)\n-Glitchy camera (as most platformers have)\n-Big the Cat\n-More graphical fixes could have been added, considering this is the director's cut.\n\nA Chaos 6/10\n\nP.S.

While that irritated me, it's really the only major issue i've had with the game. The game, in my opinion, is a solid 7.5 out of 10.

Although the people who hate this game bring up some good points (eg. the camera can be crappy at times and the game is kind of broken), I think this is still a great game.\n\nThe things that I like about the game are the different characters with different play styles (even though Amy is kind of slow and Fishing with Big can be frustrating...), the chao garden (Even though I play in Sonic Adventure 2's Chao Garden more) it gives you a reason to keep coming back to the game.\n\nThe things I don't like about the game include; The camera, the english voice acting is bad (but you can just switch the voices to japanese, it sounds 100 times better than the english voice acting), and the graphics are not so good (But I don't really care about graphics anyways...)\n\nAnyways, to keep this short. I recomend this game.","March 23, 2015","true","28.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a real adventure running through the hub trying to find something or unlock a stage. Sonic has 10 stages while the rest have 5 except for Big who has 4 in addition to  the perfect Chaos final boss (which is not a spoiler because it's in the opening!). That would be 35 levels in total. the base world for the level is always the same with different challenges for every character. Each character has a unique goal the have to do to complete the stage which keeps the levels very different for each character which can keep you really busy (especially Big's story because his stages were the hardest). The extra mission are challenging as well and once you finish all of them you get to play as Metal Sonic which is pretty rewarding since the only time you see him in the main game is in a tank.","December 28, 2014","true","40.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You will be forced to watch the credits roll 7 times (and before you think you can just reset your game to skip them, think again, you will be forced to repeat the last mission for each character if you dont watch the whole credits roll). You will also need to deal with a painstaking camera, which will cause you many cheap deaths. Regardless, this game is fun. You are able to use 6 characters, though Sonic's levels are the longest and have the best level designs. Each character has a unique twist in their gameplay, so there's variety. The game has a fitting music, which are mostly cheese-like guitar riffs. The color palette chosen for the game was appropriate: The characters are colorful, with mostly bright colors. This fits with the lighthearted story, and an overall targeted for a child audience. Doing homing attacks to robots it's fun. The game runs at mostly 60 fps (though you may need to turn some graphic options off depending on your computer, even for an old game). The game will take you around 10 hours, which are mostly fun, though it has some padding and repetitive cutscenes. The game's aesthetic fits this game just fine. The music also improves the whole easygoing feel of the game. The gameplay is kept simple (move, jump, and attack), which suits just fine with this game. Perfect gift for a 10 year old, retro gamers, or any sonic fans. Reccomended if you enjoyed: Sonic adventure 2, sonic heroes, and Sonic Generations.","December 28, 2014","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(I'm playing on a Superclocked 3GB 660 Ti, definitely not my hardware when I run Crysis 3 on Very High/Ultra @60fps).\n\nCamera changes often glitch and change multiple times on turns, and often leave you unable to actually see your path while the camera is changing.\n\nControls are not responsive or consistent, a small tap left sometimes turns you, then other times will only drift you you slightly left - then you'll hit a corner and you the same small tap does the full turn... wot?\nIt appears as though your speed effects this, and I have a feeling the FPS is linked with the pysics calculations - creating the issues with the camera changes and random FPS drops. Attack and interact are the same button, very touchy with when it decides you have hit the button for which reason.\n\nDead spots. The maps are loaded with deadspots. This means you can be within bounds and have your character get stuck inside/behind things. You will have to quit. This happened multiple times while trying to complete just the first level.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, I did not play the original, so I can not determine if this is an extremely poor port or if the game is truly utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. (lol steam bleeping out the word boll ocks)\nHere's hoping it's just a bad port, as I know a lot of people are die-hards for this game, and I hope they are able to find a means to play the original game in a manor that is functional.","January 16, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game also gives you 5 other side stories that includes old favorites like Tails and Knuckles. The game is a quick playthrough and could be completed within a day or two but the replay value is abundant. You can replay the levels and go for the best time, complete missions, listen to a unique and awesome soundtrack, and take care of little pets called Chao. This game is an original and with the 7.99 price tag it is way more than worth the buy.

As a result any configurations you make will not be saved.

Even once you manualy make the registry edit, it will not let you change the key bindings. And if you deside to get a controller for the game and get it set up, the buttons will be mapped out wrong and you will automatically look up and left rendering the game unplayable.

I went through almost all 20 of my lives on that thing), and, of course, there's a Chao garden.\n\nAlthough there are a few glitches and camera issues, which are to be expected from a game this old, they aren't game breaking.

Not to mention... the voice acting and lip syncing. Good god.\nThough, in all honesty, the moment when the physics break, or when the voice acting is horendous, it makes the game a little more enjoyable. I tend to get a good laugh out of it, rather than being frustrated at it. Though maybe there are times where if the game breaks at a dire situation, I would call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nOther than that, the main positives I can give this game is the story, and (obviously) the chao garden. I remember spending countless hours on the chao garden just taking care of those cute little creatures and it was really relaxin; like I was taking a little break from so much action from the game. The story was interesting too, and at moments it got quite tear jerking. (Especially with E-102 GAMMA, but I wont spoil it here). Big the Cat's missions were kind of slow, but playing it now, I kind of like the slow pace of fishing. Like the chao garden, it gives you a sort of break from the rest of the story; and I guess maybe that's what the developers were kind of going for.\n\nOverall I would give the game a 8/10. Though there are major flaws, they can really just be either overlooked, or just make the game a little more enjoyable at times. :)","December 1, 2015","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now, Sonic Adventure was released in 1999 for the Dreamcast and, in 2004, it got a remake for the GameCube and PC, entitled Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut, the game this port claims to be. At the time, this game was great, with great soundtrack, great level design, great visuals (well, the DX version at least), great gameplay and an all-around great fun. Nowadys, this game is still great, though unfortunally a bit dated. The fact that this game is dated doesn't bother me in the slightest, as this game is very nostalgic for me and I really wanted to replay this, even knowing that it was dated, but the fact that this game is dated may affect some newcomers, as they might be bothered by this game's faults. That's not to say this game is bad nowadays, no, far from that, it's still a great game, though it's now easier to see this game's faults.\n\nNow, to the port. I just have one thing to say about this port, and it is WOW! Just...just wow. To me, it's just incredible the fact that they menaged to do such a port... It's terrible. Why you might ask? Well, they removed half the stuff from DX (including the Game Gear games, WHICH WAS THE REASON I BOUGHT THIS GAME TO BEGIN WITH), didn't fix any glitches (if anything, they added more), removed the option to play in 16:9 widesreen without the use of those purple boarders, made impossible the change of the controls when using the keyboard (which makes your camera spin around like crazy when you're peting your chao, WHICH REALLY PISSES ME OFF), made a configuration tool WHICH DOESN"T WORK WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE COMUNITY and they also removed the option to choose the japanease voices. And the fact that it's so bad baffles me, as the 2004 version, an older version, does NOT have ANY of this port's faults. I'm not even joking, the older and clunckier port is actually BETTER than the newer version. IT JUST BLOWS MY MIND. And, do you know what's the worst thing about this port? No? Well I'll tell ya', IT"S BARELY SADX AT ALL!!! WHY? Well, as I said, they removed half of the new features from the original SADX, like the Mini Game Collection, which had ALL of the Sonic Game Gear games! So, you're paying for Sonic Adventure DX, but uou're only gettng HALF of what you're paying for! This is a disgrace. Seriously, if you can find it, buy the original 2004 version of SADX for the PC or GameCube, that is the best version.\nSo, do I recommend this? Well, if you've never played Sonic Adventure and don't care about all the features that were taken out, then this is a good version to check out. But, if you're a Sonic fan and wants to relive your memories of this game, then I'd recommend the original SADX versions, as they're far supperior. I'm only gonna mark this game as recommended because it's still Sonic Adventure...\nAlso, SEGA, FIX THIS GAME!!!","May 10, 2014","true","28.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game mechanics function okay and can feel good once you've got momentum, but that momentum stops far too frequenty. Enemies sneak in attacks far too frequently and navigating levels can be obnoxious when the camera won't cooperate. That's when you can even get into the levels since the use-less hub world can be difficult to interpret in order to even enter the levels. The level design relies heavily autopilot "Look how neat these set-pieces must have looked at the time" moments, and they always feel almost like empty space while the player adjusts to their new environments. While certainly outdone in glitches and difficulty later on, this game remains best left in the past.","July 3, 2015","false","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Somehow I just can't get into it anymore after playing crazy games like Boarderlands and Serious Sam 3 or any of the Half-Life games. After those games Sonic Adventure DX feels like it got dumbed down, but it hasn't. I somehow grew out of it. I'm even getting stuck on the same level now that I first got stuck on it when I owned it the first time. It's been that long since I've played it. Don't get me wrong, this was a great game when it first came out and I still consider it a great game... for... kids. Young ones at that. Nice thing about this classic is it's actually some of the very few games that are great for kids if you want them to have fun playing video games without the brutal life-like violence most games have now-a-days.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aceawesome96/recommended/71250/","aceawesome96","AceAwesome96","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aceawesome96/","132 products in account","I first played this game about eight or nine years ago on the PC version (before it was released on Steam) and I enjoyed it as much as I still do to this day. I enjoyed playing through the game a second time after getting it on the Steam sale this year alongside childhood favorite, Sonic Adventure 2 (with Battle DLC, because I used to own the SA2:B game on the Nintendo Gamecube).\nSonic's stages are what you'd expect from the fastest hedgehog alive and these have transitioned quite well from the side-scrolling days of the Sega Genesis. They are a blast to play through, if you're used to the PC controls, in which case, you will learn how to play -or fail- rather quickly. Since Tails has always been my favorite Sonic character, I've always found his gameplay to be my favorite. It is one of the more stressful stories to play through, but once you get the hang of how his levels work, it becomes more fun while retaining its challenge. Knuckles' story is all about finding pieces of the Master Emerald, as his gameplay is a treasure hunting game. It's actually kind of fun, and is a nice diversion from the other stories. Amy is one of my least favorite stories in terms of gameplay, but as a character arc, it does some much-needed development for her character. Gamma is actually an enjoyable experience and is the non-Sonic-Tails-Knuckles story that I enjoyed the most. Then, we have Big. I'm gonna be totally honest here, it's not that bad. It's kind of relaxing and was the fastest story for me to complete.\nThe narrative is, well, very easily subject to opinion. I thought that the story connected all of the characters well enough. Most of the characters do get some great moments and some good character development. Of the six characters, I'd have to say that Tails, Amy, and Gamma get the best of the development (not in any particular order). Sonic is still at some of his best here too, so don't worry about that. Oh, and before I conclude my overly-long review, I should mention that the soundtrack is fantastic. Everything fits in some way and is pretty memorable; it is easily one of the best soundtracks in the Sonic games.\nAlthough, one of the only negatives is that the cutscenes can get really narmy thanks to some very laughable rigging and lip-syncing on the characters. Also Dr. Eggman's "I can't believe this!!!" line is something that you'll probably hear so many times over that it will be something you hear in your dreams/nightmares for the rest of your life. It's like Mass Effect's "I will destroy you!" of gaming before that took over as the most annoying thing you'll hear a hundred times in a video game.\nOverall, this is one of my favorite Sonic games of all time, and for good reason. If you haven't played it, you should give this game and its sequel a shot. Trust me, they're worth it.","November 22, 2015","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Before I played this game I was having a good day, then I made the worse mistake of the week turning on this game. As I began to play this game I realized first wowe this game has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera angles, and I was like 5 minuites in so that's always a good sign for a good game. Then I got to the first level to rescue my furry friend tails. Well Between auto rolling under the guard rails and falling off the spinning parts and don't forget glitching through the map I had enough of this game. Keep in mind im only maybe 20 minuites into this  game. After finally rescuing tails I shut off this game, shut down my computer and proceeded to cry at how low sega has gone in game quality.\n\n\n\nRating out of 10 3/10\n\nAtleast it turns on... never mind\n\n\n\n2/10","December 31, 2015","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Granted, I didn't play this with a controller, so that may have contributed to the problem, but it's not that big of an excuse when I enjoyed Sonic Generations pretty well without a controller.  There's a lot of flaws with this game, and I don't really have anything to say that hasn't been said before.  This game may have been "good" during its release, but it did not age well.

This game has so much nostalgia for me and getting to play it again on pc after so many years was just amazing. This game has so much potential and does deliver. Sonic adventure DX   has a great story, lots  of replay ability for both the story and the fact of there being so many Emblems to get after the main game in you so chose to 100% the game. Another great part of this game is being able to raise chao and race them. Sonic adventure DX also have a awesome sound track from the intro theme to the character themes I would give the sound track a 7 out of 10. Aside from all that you got good stage desgin and graphics. The only complaint I have on this game is that the Camera not the best in the world i found that i had a hard time seeing my character on the one of the stages however personally i would not  let that get you to discourage as the Camera sistuation is only minor an not a huge issue.\n\nso to sum all this up heres a lsit of pros and cons\npros\n.Replay ability\n.great story\n.chao rasing\n.chao racing\n. awesome sound track\n.good graphics\n.great level desing\n\nCons\n.minor Camera issues","January 26","true","25.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
