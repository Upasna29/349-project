This game has everything and comes from a complete different angle than any other game before it. Yes the game is old, and yes it doesn't look as nice as some of the other games but try to look past that. The game play for this game is awesome and players really have to hone their skills if they want to stay on top. This game also has a very nice casual aspect of it which allows for tones of player to player communication and socialization. This game also has an interesting team aspect that allows for players to really work together in order to achieve victory. There are also tournaments hosted weekly by Pro@ which allow for people to show off their skills and also learn from other great players.\nI highly recommend this game and I hope that if you are reading this you buy the game or at least ask question.\n","December 29, 2013","true","024.3"," 370 of 387 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","370","387","2","39"

It's a simple and straightforward story, driven by the most classic of action hero motivations: revenge. It's a fine line to walk for our Jedi protagonist, Kyle Katarn. But he's no Luke Skywalker. From blasters, grenades, mines and more, no weapon goes left unused by Katarn in his quest for answers. And yes, that includes lightsabers.\n\nIn fact, the Jedi Knight series still possesses the best lightsaber combat to date. Every swing, every thrust has the potential to be deadly, whether it's your lightsaber or your enemy's. No florescent batons here: swings cut through enemies neatly and quickly, as they should. Enable the dismemberment option for increased pandemonium.\n\nThe greatest con might be the series' age. The visuals definitely diminished with time. But see if that still matters when the game hands you a lightsaber, a room full of Storm Troopers, and John William's score begins swelling.\n\nOh, and did I mention they got Billy Dee Williams back to voice Lando? Because they got Billy Dee back to voice Lando. Awesome.","October 23, 2014","true","0.1"," 307 of 326 people (94%) found this review helpful 47 people found this review funny","94","307","326","47","0"

I will stop myself before I go too deep into the other game before it's too late.\n\nOnce you get tired of singleplayer you can then spawn a bunch of rebel and imperial armies and spectate the massacre or you may attempt to take on a reborn army by yourself while having the maximum gore, matrix spin command and god mode enabled. I assure you it will keep you entertained.\n\nAfter that it's time to behold the divine radiance of the most angry, most unpleasant and most frag hungry community that dwells in the jk2 multiplayer. That is ofcourse, if you're playing the 1.02 version of the game. Other versions of the game feel and act as singleplayer while the 1.02 version is like combining quake and soul calibour but without a insane amounts possible combos you can perform. Multiplayer takes some time to get used to but it's worth it (tryhard intensifies).\n\nJK2 was praised for the way you used your force powers, you actually felt like a real jedi and it was awesome. Visuals aren't too impressive since it has aged a bit (2002).The story in singleplayer was decent but nothing too intriguing, also the weapons were fun to use but ofcourse once you get your lightsaber back you don't want to use guns again. You progress through singleplayer in a typical fashion, and aquire a new force power after you complete each level. Level design was good but it didn't vary as much as I hoped it would.\n\nThe game is easy to mod and gives you even more stuff to have fun with. Mapping isn't too hard as well, it all depends how much ambition you have. You can also download a ridicilous amounts of mods for both singleplayer and multiplayer for even more fun. A HD remake of this game would mean serious cash for Lucas ar- I mean Disney.\n\nUnfortunately my review can't even give a close enough impression on exactly how devine this game is, 10/10 best game I have ever played, there's a special place in my heart for this game.\n\nP.S: If you need any help with the multiplayer, patching or anything related to the game I will do everything in my power to help you if you ask nicely.\n\nWe don't make games as we used to anymore.","January 14, 2015","true","137.9"," 163 of 174 people (94%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","94","163","174","27","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hoimingmissile/recommended/6030/","hoimingmissile","hoimingmissile","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hoimingmissile/","620 products in account","I'm sure this game was amazing at the time of release. You actually get to play as a Jedi with a lightsaber! And it's not just a click-to-melee-attack weapon, you can control the direction of the swing and stuff! The lightsaber combat would have been something new and innovative at the time.\n\nUnfortunately, once again I've ended up playing a sequel before a previous installment. I played Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy already. I thought I'd done right this time, I mean, come on! That one is called Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, this one is called Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast.\n\nWith that polished experience in mind, I found Outcast's lightsaber combat frustrating. I know how to use the lightsaber but time and time again I found myself getting sliced to pieces. The Reborn and the Dark Jedi are able to perform rapid and intricate slash maneuvers that you just cannot.\n\nSpeaking of frustrating, this game has some of the worst level design I've ever seen. I don't like it when games insist on holding my hand the whole time with large waypoint markers on linear maps but Jedi Outcast really went all the way in the other direction. Almost every mission found me stuck at some point because I simply couldn't figure out where to go next. Sometimes the place you're supposed to go next would turn out to be a tiny grate IN THE CEILING in a non-descript room that you'd already passed through earlier in the level. Sometimes it's an inconspicuous hole that's off to the side of the path, but the path continues for several more encounters with no indication so you wind up fighting through one or two more entire map sections before finally ending up in a place with walls you can't climb and doors that don't open, wondering if there's a switch that you missed somewhere.\n\nEnding this on a high note, the plot was good and the sounds of the Star Wars universe are always a pleasure to listen to. The music, the beeps and whirs of panels, even the sound of blaster fire, it's great.","October 5, 2015","true","18.8"," 129 of 165 people (78%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","78","129","165","19","17"

It's not the most challenging game out there, but there's barely any 'grinding'...the pace remains throughout, and some of the challenges will force you to engage your mind more than you would expect.\n\nBut most importantly!

I believe it is supposed to be a sequel to Jedi Knight 1 which is the sequel to Dark Forces 1... all FPS games and very old now and completely missed out by myself.\n\nIn any case, Outcast is a blend of FPS and TPS genres. Both perspectives are available throughout the game and they determine the weaponry used to dispose of your enemies. Obviously, weapons such as blasters are for the FPS perspective while wielding your lightsaber is the easiest from a third person perspective.\n\nThe game has an excellent story and some recognisable faces appear here and there (strictly following the storyline of the trilogy from the '70s / '80s). Music is, of course, the good-old John Williams-composed score and since they are really good why would we need anything else?\n\nThe only issue with the game is that I remember playing it in FPS mode, at first, but once I obtained the lightsaber I finished the rest in TPS mode. I mean, if having a lightsaber is de rigueur in a Star Wars game then why would you want to switch back to the general assortment of weapons? Also, your lightsaber coupled with the many jedi powers available is the best way to play such a game.\n\nThe game can be difficult at times but allowing you to follow both paths (i.e. Light and Dark sides) it deserves a second walkthrough. Outcast runs on the Quake 3 engine which, years ago, was quite beautiful but now is somewhat of an obsolete engine. In any case, this is an all-time classic and you are to purchase it especially if you played it already 10 years ago. Collecting classics is always a good pastime!\n\nPS: Widescreen resolutions are unavailable from the game menu - head over to wsgf.org to see the solution for the issue.","October 12, 2014","true","0.3"," 43 of 52 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","43","52","2","0"

Now, I'll do my best so my love for this game doesn't hide it's problems, and I will start right off with them, as usual:\n\nThe biggest problem this game has, is that it was NOT build for computers of this generation. The resolution is not the only problem you'll have to face, but there are also glitches, such as strange shadows and even (at least on my case), strange brightness errors, as I everthing was strangely bright and I had to lower it, making me see it right, but all screenshots show the game to be really dark. If you want to play the game, have patience and look for guides arround the Internet on how to get over these problems.\n\nThe second problem it has, and really the only other I have, are the difficulty spikes. There are areas of the game that don't f#ck arround. Take Nar Shadda (did I type that right?) as an example, a huge map FILLED WITH SNIPERS, which can easily 1-Hit kill you with barely any time to react... And yet you're supposed to do all kinds of platforming arround it, on which missing a platform will kill you. There are other examples, such as your first encounter with the shadow sith jedi guys, which are WAY MORE POWERFUL AND TOUGH than any other Reborn you've faced so far (even more than the boss before that), and you're supposed to take on two at the same time. Even with all of your powers later on, just one of these guys might get tricky, just get the idea. The game ain't a walk in the park, and you should expect it to be a tough journey.\n\nHowever, is the game good if we look away from those two problems? You bet your motherf#cking ♥♥♥. The game is a sequel on the Jedi Knight series of games, and follows up Kyle Katarn's adventures, but it ain't really needed that you play the previous games to understand it. However, you might need a bit of knowledge about Star Wars to understand most of it. It starts as a classic FPS with tons of enemies, no regenerative health, armor (or shields, in this case), and a ton of enemies who are pathetic and weak in comparison with you. However, the game changes itself mid-way, as soon enough you have a light-saber and can use the power of the force, AND THAT'S WHEN THE GAME TRULY GOES FROM GOOD TO F#CKING GREAT. Light-saber combat on this game is insanely fun to pull-off, specially against other Light-saber users.\n\nThe force also feels natural on the game, neither being useless or broken: just like in the movies, it's a tool. You can push stuff, pull stuff, slow-down the game, mind-trick people like old Ben Kenobi did on the movies, a ton of cool stuff. There are a lot of powers in the game, and you unlock them as you go through it. Some enemies also use them, and eventually you'll find a use to most of them on your play-style.\n\nThe story and the characters also feel great. I won't spoil much more (I did spoil that you get a light-saber, BUT COME ON, KYLE HAS IT ON NEARLY ALL THE ADDS OF THE GAME ANYWAY!), but the only thing I didn't like about them is that Lando doesn't appear nearly enough, and characters such as Han Solo would have also been great. Oh, and the game goes after Episode VI and before the new one.\n\nThe multiplayer was fun, also. And I say "was" and not "is", as I doubt there are many servers, anymore. If you want the game for the multiplayer, look for Jedi Academy instead, it's sequel. But if you want a really GOOD and solid singleplayer experience, look no further. This game on a sale is quite the steal, and if you like Star Wars, you're garanteed to like it. And if you don't... Well, refund the game, seek medical attention.","January 13","true","11.0"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","18","20","2","0"

The game is much more blaster/mine/rocket oriented at first, later the lightsaber comes into play too. While good the lightsaber animation could have used a bit polish as they are clunky sometimes. But they are still fun. Oh, and a lot of fun! With the dismemberment option on it feels like really having a powerful weapon you can cut every opponent with. And again we also get Force powers. The level design is done the classic Jedi Knight way - sometimes good and sometimes confusing. But the game remains enjoyable. The community of players who play online is weaker compared to Jedi Academy so I advise trying that out for MP. The mods are there for this game and use most of the potential so maybe take a look at some. This is  a fine game for all who like Star Wars and/or have played the previous Jedi Knight games.

I am signing, sealing, and delivering this title to you as a must play. This entry in the Dark Forces Series takes the mantle from its predecessors and makes it 10 feet taller. This title makes me yearn for a modern, force user centric 1st person shooter set in the Star Wars universe - a yearning which was not quite quenched with the re-release of Battlefront in 2015.\n\nPROS\nThe solid and ground breaking gameplay from Dark Forces & Dark Forces II is back,\nStreamlined user interface which is easy to navigate,\nAmazing lightsaber combat with subtle, yet strong features including stance variation,\nImproved character movement including acrobatic features,\nFamiliar and iconic enemies with interesting new additions,\nExcellent new weapons,\nAddition of a slow-motion action- and death-sequence camera,\nGreat graphics with amazing attention to detail (rain drops hitting your lightsaber make it "sizzle"!),\nIconic locations influenced by the original titles in the series, and the original Star Wars Trilogy,\nWell implemented inclusions of iconic characters such as Luke Skywalker & Lando Calrissian,\nCONS\nA lack of the previously implemented psuedo-RPG system,\nOccasionally glitchy hit recognition,\n\nCONCLUSIONS...\nA great 1st person shooter and an outstanding Star Wars game. This title takes you on a magnificanet and exciting return journey; not only into Star Wars, but into the Dark Forces mythos and the Expanded Universe (now labelled Star Wars "Legends").\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=641471021\nWhile at the time of writing this review this title was almost 15 years old, it has aged incredibly well. The attention to detail Raven Software managed to pack into this game is amazing, with the rain even "sizzling" against the blade of your lightsaber on some levels. The atmoshpere, the gameplay, the difficulty challenge, the level design, the story, the character monouverability...the amount of content - all should be used as a standard against which to measure even today's AAA blockbusters.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=641496578\nAs with any title. there are some flaws with the game, however, these are all really minor and are a sign of its age. The only truly negative aspect, which is still only a minor detraction from the overall experience, was the removal of the pseudo-RPG system introduced in Dark Forces II. I missed the opportunity to specialise my character in either the light or dark side of the force, which seemed to add another variation to the gameplay and to the replayability of Dark Forces II. This is easy to forgive however, and does make old Kyle Katarn a little more versatile; quickly dispatching foes with force grip, while still having the ability to heal yourself with the force.\n\nAll in all this game is amazing; even by today's standards. Stop reading this review right now and go and buy this title... better yet, buy the Dark Forces Bundle - YOU WON'T REGRET IT!.\n\n\n_______________________\nRANKING DESCRIPTIONS\n\nScore        Description                1        This pile of c%$p made me want to take a break from gaming!                2        Avoid this title like a fat man on a diet avoids cake.                3        Why did they even bother?

I've played it through again just few weeks ago so my opinion is not based on nostalgia. While Jedi Academy adds lightsaber moves and is newer this one has better story (not anything amazing but it mostly makes sense and that's more than what I can say about most recent games) and makes you appreciate weapons other than the lightsaber. The puzzles are a mixed bag, most are good but there are some that will make you run in circles (although usually you just need to look up to solve them). Jedi Outcast's strongest point is undoubtedly combat - a mix of classic FPS and great lightsaber/force system. Some powers/weapons are obviously better than the others but on Padawan difficulty level you can pretty much play around as you like. And play around you can! Force Pull stormtrooper's rifle from his hands and watch as he runs away in panic! Grab one enemy with Force Choke and shield yourself from his friends fire! Finally, I recommend playing with a certain cheat code activated - g_saberRealisticCombat 1 - It allows you to cut apart enemies a lot more than the base game (although it's a bit buggy and results in beheaded characters screaming and other weirdness. Nothing gamebreaking though). Word of warning - it makes the game both easier and harder since it makes some hit zones an instant kill (for both player and npcs). It causes shorter, more frantic duels with Dark Jedi and can end the final battle in seconds (which is hilarious when it happens). Overall I rate the game 8.5/10 (-1,5 for all the annoyances along the way).

The game has amazing lightsaber combat, some of the best sword style combat on any platform.\nJedi Outcast has great shooting mechanics as well as easy access Force powers.\nBeing the game came out in 2003, it takes influence from many sources. It contains elements of influence from the matrix, force jump allows you to run up walls, and force speed slows all projectiles around you. The game even has the unreal Flak Cannon (called the flechette gun).\n\nThe game has an interesting online community with more than just your standard death match fare. It has a different rule set with players often taking time to duel rather than straight openly murder each other (Though some servers have different rules and contain straight death match)\nIt's worth taking note you can turn off your lightsaber with the 1 button, often players find the saber turned state as you being hostile.\n\nFor the cheap price of 10 bucks this game is worth it, I've spent easily over 400 hours on it.

In my opinion it is the best game in the whole series (some may disagree) because it contains a very nice single player and and very good (and well balanced) multiplayer.\n\nSingeplayer: The SP is set after the collapse of the empire. The ex-Jedi Knight Kyle Katarn is working as a mercenary for the new formed republic, trying to find outposts of the Remnant troops of the empire, who still work against the republic. In the process of the singleplayer Katarn regains his jedi power and discovers the real aims of the imperial troops. The story telling is very well embeded in the normal game flow, which is a good mix of action (fighting with weapons, lightsabers, force) and thinking (solving puzzles, finding ways). There is an option to set the level of difficulty, so the game is demanding, no matter how good or bad you are.\n\nMultiplayer: After the SP (which is quite long), you may want to play MP. The general MP is very similiar to other Quake3-Games: You have Gametypes like Deathmatch, TD, CTF etc. But there are also some special gamemodes like JediMaster (one player is the jedimaster with every force power, the rest just owns weapons and has to kill him), CTY (like CTF but the flag-stealer isnt allowed to use force), Holocron (the force powers are spreaded at the maps in little boxes which you can pick up).  After you joined a MP server you'll have to set your name, your skin and your force powers, where you can choose either the dark or light side and disturb force points in the different powers (like lightning, absorbation, healing, jump, speed). Note that there servers which disable weapons or forces, leaving you with nothing more than your saber ;)\nThe MP experience itself is unique - you can have normal deathmatches there, but also nice chats or exciting light saber duels; the lightsaber fight is the best I have ever seen in a Star Wars game: you can choose your style (fast, medium, slow means: less, normal, many damage per hit) and the saber reacts to every mouseclick you do, so with a bit of training you can do really nice combos. Also, back then, the modding community was quite active, giving you access to dozens of very good maps, tools and server mods.\n\nSooo all in all - buy the game, you'll not regret it :D\nps: I know Steam shows 0 hours on record, thats because my old JK wasnt linked with steam - my real play time lies anywhere among 500 and 1000 hours.\npss: ooh and sorry for my english, this isn't my main language.","January 15, 2014","true","13.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Kyle abandoned both the force and his lightsaber after the incident at the end of the MotS and now works with Jan Ors on some missions for the Republic. Mon Mothma, Leader of the New Republic, sent them to a remnant base because of an intercepted communication citing the valley of the jedi and a rebirth. They will discover some experiments, and after an ambush Kyle will be forced to re-establish his connection with the force and get back his lightsaber in order to retaliate against the remnants.\nI know it might sound dull but I'm trying to keep the most important details because I would spoil the best parts of the story, which is very important in this chapter, as it's very well studied. And during our journey we'll meet very well known character as Lando And Luke Dubbed by Billy Dee Williams and Mark Hamill Themselves.\n\nThe gameplay follows the classic structure of the previous chapters but it's more polished and has lots of innovations that make this chapter the best. You start the game without lightsaber or force powers as in Dark Forces 2, so you will use blasters and weapons. There will be some old classics, such as Kyle's blaster pistol, the wookie bowcasters, thermal detonators, and the good old the E-11 blaster rifle that will be imprecise as usual (in a shy attempt to justify the stormtroopers' lame aim). Of course there will be new weapons, as rocket launchers, explosives and tripbombs, but the real innovation comes as soon as you recover your force powers and your lightsaber as a third person view is applied and the levels will urge you to jump up and down with your jedi powers. Now jump and the saber throw are not force powers to use but are implicit in your actions (meaning you can use force jump as you jump, and launch the lightsaber with the secondary fire button), and the best part is of course the lightsaber combat system. Now you don't have just a couple of clunky moves, now you have a proper combat system where your moves will be determined by any direction key you use and you will "learn" three combat styles, Normal, Strong and fast that will allow to deal different damage ranges, strike with different speeds and chain your moves also with coreographics rotations. During your fights you can also lock you lightsaber against a sith's lightsaber and you have to hit fire as fast as you can to push harder and leave the opponent defenseless for a few second so you can exploit that opening to strike hard.\n\nAnyways this is the only Jedi knight you don't choose light or dark side, as the story requires a fixed path and the force powers are improved automatically as the level design might require specific powers and abilities.\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of this game is music. I definitely Love the Star Wars tunes from John Williams and in this chapter there are great classic tunes and, as opposed to Dark Forces 2 and MotS we have again dynamic music, with quiet and action tunes perfectly linked with smooth passage tunes. Something already seen (or maybe  heard) already with the first Dark Forces Midi tracks and now back again in great style and high quality.\n\nAnother really great side of this game is the visual impact. Even nowadays the levels are really good looking and the Star Wars atmosphere is stronger than ever, since the very beginning. But as I said, the best comes the moment you get your lightsaber with the force powers: the first mission will be in Nar Shaddaa, the vertical city, then Bespin City and so on. There will be lots of familiar ambients, neverending pits, gigantic vertical structures that only a Jedi will ever be able to walk through.\nThe engine is based on id Tech 3 (Quake 3 Arena's Engine), And even though it's not the new battlefront Engine, it doesn't look bad, all in all. Level design is really good and saves this title from aging really bad, even though the polygon counter for maps and models doesn't even compare recent titles and volumetric shadows on characters really look bad, buggy and odd, while all the other FXs really give great justice to the game.\nAt the time the Ghoul system was the thing so it was mandatory: every character or NPC has "Hot spots" which will determine a specific pain or death animation.\n\nUnfortunately there are some cons, which didn't stop me from playing and appreciate to the fullest this game, anyways.\nThe game doesn't support 16:9 resolutions natively... But you can edit with notepad the config file to force your desired resolution and fix the FOV in order to keep an appropriate perspective.\nAs long as you move in First person you won't notice that too much but as soon as you switch in third person it's more evident. At the time I couldn't stand it so I decided to make my ow mod for them: animations are a bit rigid and clunky. Your idle positions are improbable as the character doesn't even try to breath, you and everyone else walk and run as if you were slipping because the animation is too slow to represent the speed you're moving at.\nAnd the worst part of the game: AI. Yes, siths are strong and both stormtroopers and mercenaries will shoot you or run for safer places according to your position or they will just run away and surrender in case you pull away their weapon, but it won't be rare to face enemies that won't recognize you or the mess and killing you made 10 mts away, or enemies that will run back and forth not knowing what to do, or falling down in pits.\n\n+++PROs+++ STORY. Clearly I loved this chapter's story, Kyle gets back his force powers with a better and more logical reason here than in DF2 (where he spontaneously becomes a Jedi without any training). We have everything in this story: a plot, a reason for revenge, hope and redemption, tributes (lots of guests, places, references, and a particular boss fight that somehow reminds me of the final fighth in Dark Forces) and...\nKYLE KATARN. The very best portrayal of this character, someone that has seen lots of things in the universe, did many good and bad things and his sarcasm proves he aged knowing that. Kyle know he's not perfect, he's not a saint and knows he's not a Jedi, but he's "just a guy with a lightsaber" that will do his very best to achieve his goals, be it stop the remnants or mere revenge.\nSOUNDTRACK. I love so much John William's music and the re-introduction of the dynamic music system in this chapter is really great and delivers an amazing soundtrack that perfectly fits and follows your actions, be it explorations or fights. Simply great.\nVISUAL IMPACT. The game is getting old but it still looks pretty good thanks to a very good level design and familiar places.\nGAMEPLAY. It's simply amazing to fight with such a good system, I've always loved the lightsaber fights as that's still my favourite most used weapon, and force powers are much more comfortable to use than the previous chapter. You can also run and jump on walls, which is useless but really coreagraphic.---CONs--- AI. You will face enemies that won't recognize you or the mess and killing you made 10 mts away, or enemies that will run back and forth not knowing what to do, or falling down in pits.\n4:3. Unfortunately, due to the age, the game doesn't support 16:9 resolutions natively. Luckily you can just edit the cfg to force your own resolution. Everything is explained in details in the steam community.\nCLUNKY ANIMATIONS. There are some clunky or too basic animations in the game such as "non-breathing" idle positions or slow running and walking animations.","June 6","true","8.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","5"

Blasters (and almost every weapon) suck (except a few of the later ones), but you don't give a sith about it (see what I did there?) once you become a Jedi again, given the awesome light-saber combat and force powers that are included.\n\nMediocre shooter (since everything moves faster than most of the projectiles in the game), great Jedi Simulator. This game is still far from stale or dated, except for the stupid level design that took place in a couple of spots in the storyline. I just finished it, and it was completely worth my time and effort to learn how to handle the bloody saber.","September 21, 2015","true","34.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

After going through a few puzzling missions, you'll eventually gain force powers and a lightsaber. I'm not going to go any further (spoilers). But the lightsaber battles are great and you will actually use other weapons, so ya don't have to stick with a lightsaber. You can clear enemies in your path with the force (lightning) and throw enemies of edges using force (grip).

As a sequel to Jedi Knight, Jedi Outcast continues the tale of Kyle Katarn, a man whose experience with the Dark Side in Mysteries of the Sith has left him rather jaded with regards to the Force. He comes out a better man for it, though – it is in this game that he established himself as one of my favourite Star Wars characters ever.\n\nNow, Jedi Knight II is a game from the early 00's, so it's obviously a bit dated.

Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast puts you in the head of Kyle Katarn, a Jedi with a conflicted past and uneasy relationship with the force, and takes you through a journey of loss, discovery, gross error and ultimate redemption in the face of a dire threat, marshaled by a Dark Jedi named Dessan, spearheaded by a force of artificially-imbued pseudo-Jedi known as 'Reborn'.\n\nThe first few levels of the game are a straight forward first-person shooter with puzzle solving elements and some platforming. This is a very well crafted part of the game with strong weapon play (it is respectable that the game developers put the effort into fully fleshing out both portions of the gameplay - both lightsabers and weapons) if slightly outdated AI. The second level in particular - set in a Coruscant-like city of towering blocks and bottomless pits between them named 'Nar Shaddaa' (also seen in TOR, and possibly Bounty Hunter') - features some genuinely devious puzzles and sniper challenges.\n\nAfter these portions of the game, the player takes up the mantel of the Jedi once again - with the assistance of a Mark Hamill-voiced Luke Skywalker - and fights through a number of missions of platforming, puzzle solving, and some exquisitely entertaining lightsaber battles and 'boss' encounters.\n\nJKII is a challenging game, long, with well designed levels and graphics that, while ageing, still stand up (and can be modded). Memorable characters, a good story, some twists that are very much in the tradition of the canon and some fantastic cameos by characters from the original Star Wars trilogy all goes together to make this game a must-play.","March 13, 2014","true","29.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I think this game is a must have for every true Star Wars fan. It's an old game so don't expect beautiful graphics. The story is great. Together with the Star Wars setting and iconic music/effects it gives a great feeling.\n\nThe lightsabre combat is amazing. It isn't easy though, takes time to master! Even if you think you are a skilled melee fighter by the end of the game, you go online and people will beat you like nothing. Using force powers also really fit into the game, every single force power is useful.\n\nWhat I didn't like the most is the level design. If you play for the first time, you will get stuck everywhere. Sometimes you need to shoot a crate somewhere to blow a hole in the wall or jump on top of a structure which is not self explanaitory. But either you walk around for hours trying to find the way or go online and check a walkthrough (better option).\n\nThe game forces you to use weapons insead of lightsabre lot of times, because annoying snipers are everywhere. The problem on hardest difficulty is the lack of balance, it surely wasn't tested well. There are some very tough fights, the fight with Lando on Nar Shaddaa, where I was pulling my hair after trying for the hundredth time, while the main fights are quite easy. Beating Tavion wasn't much of a challenge and the final boss is way too easy.\n\nAll in all a great game with some bad level design, 8/10 would recommend!","December 28, 2015","true","19.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Such as:\n* The map designs are awful and you occasionally get stuck wandering about trying to find your way only to realize that you were suppose to go in a direction that doesnt make any sense at all (appearently i wasnt suppose to walk out on the lenghty bridge that looks like its leading on the right direction, instead you have to jump out of a window in a dark corner).\n* Enemy snipers are ridiculously accurate and fast on the trigger even on normal difficulty.\n* Scripted ambushes, get used to them.\n* Hitting enemies with laser pistols and rifles can be a tedious business. Trying to hit constantly strafing foes with laser lights that travel at the speed of small rodents gets old pretty quickly. Instead I just run in a straight line towards them holding down the fire button. Doesnt sound like an intresting gun fight at all now does it.\n* Grenade throwers, they are everywhere. Strangely enough often in tiny rooms.\n* Did i hit with my light saber or not? Maybe, who knows. The light saber fights are often just a shiny mess.\n\nSo there are alot of frustrating issues with the game, but for some reason i keep getting back to it. I turn it off with a sigh but i still start it a few hours again later. So there is obviously some appeal in it, i dont know what it is though =P","November 26, 2013","true","13.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I remember back when it first came out how amazing it was. It's an FPS where you can also have a lightsaber (it becomes third person for that weapon.) What I remember amazing me when this came out was that the lightsaber actually leaves marks in the wall where you hit it. It was awesome then and is still pretty neat.  I played BioShock: Infinite immediately before Jedi Outcast this time. What struck me was how easy BioShock is compared to this game. In BioShock, all you have to do is push “n” and you see where you have to go. This game hss hardcore puzzle solving with no hints in game. It really is amazing the difference between the games. All in all this is a 10/10 for me. I hope this game is playable on future OS as well. As of now it is very playable on Windows 8, and you can even find a fix online to make the resolution look good on modern screen resolutions.

It takes place about 9 ABY, Witch is nine years after Return Of The Jedi. You play as the Ex-jedi mercenary Kyle Katarn from the previouse 3 Dark Forces games, you are running several missions for the New Republic when suddenly you and your partner jan ors get attacked by a Sith and his apprentice, this leads to kyle katarn getting his ♥♥♥ kicked and his long time partner jan ors getting "Killed". Kyle then goes to gain his force powers back and his lightsaber back to get revenge on the sith and his apprentice.\n\nIn this game you run into multiple characters from the original movies, like Lando and luke skywalker. You visit several planets that are also from the movies as well as some new ones. You start out as a plain mercenary without any force, it feels like a run and gun game for a while, headshotting stormtroopers, The missions commonly seem to be "Find The Key and open the door" or "Turn on the power" things common of a FPS of its era. When you get your lightsaber things get pretty exciting, the lightsaber plays VERY WELL, you can do so much with it, and when you get to dueling sith its REALLY awesome. The force powers are also very interesting and amusing, Force Lightning sends enemies flying while being shocked to death, force choke can pick people off there feet and you can even kill them by impact against a wall. I have one problome with this game,\n\nthe big one being the weapons, not the weapons them selfs but how they are over shadowed when you get your lightsaber, Weapons can come in handy to take down a enemy who is hiding in a far corner or a grenade to blow up a group of enemies, but its really nothing a force throw or force lightning cannot take down twice as fast. Weapons do not really seem very different from each other. You have the E-11 blaster rifle witch is the standard Automatic weapon, the Bryar pistol is the weak pistol with high accuracy, these are the guns you will most likely be using the most, the others you can get after you become a jedi and are completely over shadowed by it, The guns really do feel useless after you become a jedi.\n\nThe graphics in this game are AMAZING for the time and still hold up. This uses the Quake 3 engine witch is a really good engine but alot of things that have to do with physics do not really hold up sadley.\n\nThe replay value is a  5/10 in my opinion, although I have played this game COUNTLESS times it makes it kinda hard for me to like it as much as I did when I first played it. I would say the replay value is mediocre. nothing more and nothing less.\n\nI give this game a 8.5/10\n\nif this were the first time I played this game I would give it a 9/10.

Jedi Outcast was an addiction for me for well over a year, with me modding the fudge out of this game and setting up my own epic battles between hundreds of Jedi and Sith every weekend, with hours spent enjoying realistic saber gore. The saber combat was amazing coming off the story-focused prequel, and made the multiplayer an addictive addition (which I totally dominated for months!) to a single-player campaign on the level of the best EU material.\n\nWhile the level design often remains noticeably, remarkably Jedi Knight quality (read: confusing and maze-like), especially early on before you're able to kick total patoot and forget about level confusion.\n\nAlso, Katarn, Our Hero, has a beard, and he fights a Dramatic Reptile.

Player numbers were at an all time high in 6 years back then. However, currently, the game's multiplayer scene has vanished due to age. You can still find a couple servers up with dedicated members, but it's no where near populated as it was years ago. Multiplayer is still fun, however, so you should check it out for sure.\n\nWith the death of FileFronts main sites, namely Jedi Knight Files, mods and extra content for this game have vanished. There are similar sites, such as massassitemple.net, and JKHub to find salvaged mods from the early days, but there's not much being made now.\n\nAt it's core, this is quite possibly the best Star Wars game ever made in terms of lightsaber combat, expanded universe story, and force use. Like the rest of the Dark Forces/Jedi Knight series, this is a must own if you are a Star Wars fan, or if you are looking for an enjoyable Star Wars experience.","February 19, 2012","true","384.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game..... I'm gonna be up front here. Not only do I think this is the greatest Star Wars game, but I think it's the best use of the Star Wars name outside of the original trilogy. What makes this game so special to me? For one, it's a great first-person shooter, with satisfying combat and some really great level design. But what makes this game truly stand out amongst its (inferior) Star Wars-game bretheren is that at some point early in the game, there is a MAJOR change. Well, not really a change, but more of an addition: the Lightsaber and the various Force powers. When these two are introduced, the game goes from very good to just full-blown spectacular. Lightsaber combat & use of Force powers is simply perfect in this game, especially when used in conjunction. It also brings a ton of different ways you can approach combat situations- Should I mind trick the rocket-wielding Trooper to wipe out his squad for me? Push them off the cliff one by one? Or just throw my saber and slash them away mercilessly? Also, your progression of power throughout the game is pefect- your lightsaber ability and Force powers will be FAR more advanced near the end than early on, yet the game will still find creative ways to challenge your combat prowess.  Not to mention, dueling other dark Jedi is an absolute blast, and requires not only good sabering skills, but quick wits to out-think your opponent, and use your Force abilities more wisely than them. The levels are also intricately designed to allow for some fun exploration, with classic Secret Areas being scattered throughout, and there are even some decent puzzles in this game. Not only is the gameplay itself sublime, but the tale of your character, Kyle Katarn, and his return to the ways of the Force is surprisingly well-written. Although cheesy at times, the story does possess an emotional heft at certain moments, and in the end it is quite an enjoyable narrative. Oh, and all this is just covering the single-player portion of the game- there is an awesome multiplayer suite that plays well, and has some really unique gametypes going for it. All in all, I feel that this is one of the most underrated titles out there, and will always be one that I love. In my opinion, it's the best Star Wars game you can possibly find.","April 16, 2014","true","51.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

In both good and bad.\n\nSo what's good about it? It does not hold your hand. It does not restrict your actions or freedom. No QTEs of any description. It is bloody hard at places. I cosider myself a very experienced FPS player, and I've beaten this game earlier several times. But jumping into it on third(out of four) difficulty setting resulted in a pretty challenging playthrough, especially before protagonist's rejedification, when you have to rely on conventional weapons.\n\nFighting other jedi is just fantastic, and is still an eye candy after all these years. You can hack them with your lightsaber, use force powers, push them off the ledges, and even cheese them with conventional weapons sometimes, which is not an easy feat to accomplish. Even regular stormtroopers strafe and move around, making them very difficult to hit early on, until you get the hang of it.\n\nBut all this comes at a price too. Level design is just not very good at times from gameplay perspective. There is quite a bit of platforming, which is exactly as not fun as it sounds. Some environmental puzzles are just too obscure - even having beaten this game earlier I still had to use a walkthrough multiple times. Perhaps I was more patient back in the day... Sometimes you have to do things which are jsut counterintuitive. At one point player has to use force to move a crate to reveal the grate You can use force push and force pull on objects, but this particular crate had to be exactly pulled precisely from the left, it refused to move in any other direction and it made no sense.\n\nAlso, there is a special place in hell for aimbot rodians with disruptor rifles.\n\nStill, this is an enjoyable game to play and replay, but if you are new to hardcore old-scool shooters - tread lightly.\n\nP.S. The multiplayer is still alive! I've immediately found several populated servers with <50 ping at 2 A.M.","February 24","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Best know for its advanced lightsaber gameplay mechanics; Jedi Outcast's campaign, which for a new player is about 12-14 hours (8-10 on reply) is a real challenge compared to modern day releases. Some levels require precise gameplay but give you mines, outposts, and city districts to explore, with many hidden treasures.\n\nThe games main character, Kyle Katarn, is a well loved character in the star wars universe and personally my favourite character. It is a shame the new films might not use him for a role. Levels are challenging, espically on harder difficulties and show a real sense on progression through the unlocking of new force powers and leveling them up.\n\nWhile this game has less customisation then it's sequal, Jedi Acadamy, I still argue this is by far the better game. More interesting story, better villian (Deissan is a bad a**) and has more stand out moments, such as the invasion of the Jedi Temple. The soundtrack comes straight from the films and there is only really one section I have had quarels about, Simply because I don't like the AT-ST which you have to pilot.\n\nThe multiplayer is also fun and even though many don't play it anymore, you can still take advantage of the game's bot system which was not really matched until Call of Duty: Black Ops combat training mode. There are lots of maps and customisation is great with, saber's powers and character skins and dyes.\n\nOverall a great game and is incredible good value. A classic gamer without having this on their play list is really missing out. 9.8/10","March 2, 2015","true","11.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Cutscenes in particular are as laughable as they are horrifying.\n\nThe game doesn't really pick up until you get your lightsaber (2-3 levels in) and even then, it can be tough to deal with until you get more force powers. This is an old PC game, so they expect you to have two fingers stationed over the quick save/quick load keys at all times. Use them often.\n\nI found it more fun to use console cheats to crank my force powers up to max, but even then, this is old school PC first person shooter level design. Expect to get lost in Star-Wars-themed mazes for hours while you look for the one door you haven't gone through yet.\n\nDespite all of my negative comments, I still found the game to have enough charm that I kept coming back to it.

I began playing this after completing and enjoying Jedi:Academy and bit of dark forces.\n\nStory is strong. Following, the protagonist from the previous games, Kyle (former jedi) and Jann (pilot) continuing working for the new republic as mercenaries. As plans back fire, Kyle will be forced to re-unite with the 'force' again in order to seek answers and vengeance. I found the plot better than Jedi: Academy, as it was less vague with a better antagonist and motive behind the player's actions.\n\nGameplay is good. The beginning sequences of the campaign plays homage to 'Dark forces' with you having no lightsaber and forced to use guns instead. As you progress through the campaign, you will finally get access to the glowing blade as well as force powers. The force powers available include force lightning, heal, push, pull, speed and mind control. You only start off with a few powers which are at level 1. As you play, you will automatically unlock new powers and upgrades. You light saber skills will also upgrade, unlocking more powerfull offensive and defensive moves. Unfortunately, you can't customize you light saber or fighting style (ie two sabers or Darth Maul's one) like in J:A. Some people may find that starting without a lightsaber and forced to use guns for the first few levels, annoying. Another issue may arise from the level design, which by the way well done, but will leave you confused and lost some times (forcing you to use a guide like I did).\n\nThere is also a multiplayer mode available. Just like in J:A, there are variety of game modes including capture the flag, deathmatch and duel. You can customise your character and light saber (color and hilt). There a variety of maps to choose from which are mainly inspired by levels in the campaign such as the Yavin temple, while others like the death star are unique. You can play the game with bots or players with a maximum of 16 in total. As of this review there were a few players online.\n\nGraphics are alright. Although they are not as good as J:A, there isn't much difference between them. However, outcast definitely has better detailed models and textures compared to the previous Dark Forces games. I tweaked the game and played in widescreen, which made everything look clearer.\n\nAudio is great. Soundtrack is awesome as usual. Weapons like blasters and light saber slashes, sound as they should. Voice acting of characters are good as well.\n\nIf you want to play a star wars game with good combat, story and characters, Jedi: Outcast will not dissapoint.","May 18, 2015","true","14.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I remember killing stormtroopers and getting alot of pleasure out of it. I think I remember putting in a cheat which allowed me to dismember the stormtroopers (which was the best part).\n-------Story wise----------------\nNow I haven't played much of the story nor payed alot of attention. When I was a little kid I still didn't care about it. But I can say if you were to read the comic and payed attention it'll be a good story.\n----------Surroundings----------------\nOh this... Now it isn't like the witcher graphics or GTA V but, it's still a good try. From my experience, alot of the levels are just this one big playground to kill stormtroopers or others.\nNeedless to say. The art style is pretty simple. The 'outside world' is all just black and nothing else. Still pretty good.\n------------Puzzles---------------------------\nThe puzzles are simple but also times can be difficult. I'd find myself going into a walkthrough on just getting to the next bit.\n---------------Multiplayer-----------------------------\nNow, I don't remember going into multiplayer alot. But when I did, no-one would be on. It's like a desert out there. Even with bots it still felt pretty lonely. I'd always get my next door friend over but we wouldn't have fun.\n------------------------------Overall----------------------\nI do like the story and/or the Level design and stuff. But to be honest. If you haven't played this as a kid  then don't get it. Honestly people just by even without playing as a kid. But this old game is either for Nostalgia or just killing stormtroopers with the dismember cheat. Well, this is my overall review for this game.\nI'm rating it a Yes for Nostalgia.","June 6, 2015","true","33.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/recommended/6030/","Drakevarg","Drakevarg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/","94 products in account","Initially I gave this game a negative review, but after giving Dark Forces a try and replaying Force Unleashed and then this, I'm feeling a lot more charitable towards it.\n\nWhile my old criticisms still stand (the lightsaber duels being basically luck-based, a few overpowered enemies (particularly the snipers and the grenade-spamming space goats), and the stealth mission being the absolute worst idea the devs ever had), and while I still think that Jedi Academy has more polished gameplay, Jedi Outcast is still a very well put together installment, and considerably more substantial (Jedi Academy mostly being a series of brief "episodes" with full levels marking the main acts).\n\nInterestingly, I find the game is at its best in the first two levels before you get any Force powers, where you're basically playing a graphically enhanced, more linear expansion to the original Dark Forces, making me feel oddly nostalgic about callbacks to a game I only played a few weeks ago. The level design is tighter there, giving the locales a sense of continuity and scale that later parts of the game are simply lacking. I think this can be attributed to the fact that with things like Force Jump in your arsenal, the developers felt they needed to give you wide-open spaces with which to take advantage of it, which turns the levels into the "squiggly linear corridor" school of lazy level design.\n\nEven so, the levels are still fairly varied in their design, even if they feel more... "gamey" for a lack of a better word. Setpieces, not locations. Especially with the rampant Bottomless Pit abuse. Include more than one completely nonsensical example where you know said pit couldn't possibly fit in the dimensions of the location you're in, like onboard the Doomgiver, a ship that's maybe 5 stories tall at most given the orbital drop pods visible on its underside.\n\nBut that's nitpicking. The Dark Forces Saga is still probably the most EU-friendly entry into the Star Wars gaming library, and Kyle Katarn is still likable badass. Jedi Outcast is not without its major flaws, but if you can stomach them I can't in good conscience call it a bad game.","February 9, 2015","true","37.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","3"

Compared to Dark Forces 2 (I managed to run it off Steam some time ago) it's bland and irritiating. Heck, even compared to Dark Forces 1 it's lacking, and Dark Forces 1 has an auto-aim. Probably because weapons in this game (except sniper rifle and basic blaster) are so inaccurate and their power feels off it doesn't feel much different from having the auto-aim in the first game in the series. Also, being more of a 3rd person action game, the movement while in 1st person mode will cost you life many times after slipping off the ledge.\n\nYeah, this game is all about lightsaber ♥♥♥♥. But it's hard to recommend Jedi Outcast now, since Jedi Academy is plain better in that matter. While Dark Forces 2 balanced shooter and slasher gameplay pretty well, Jedi Outcast sacrificed shooting in favor of lightsaber ♥♥♥♥ (after all these years of terrible lightsabers sounds and their exploitation everywhere I grew to hate lightsabers and everything connected with them). I dunno - compared to Jedi Academy, saber fighting with AI gets my nerves off. Maybe the multiplayer is the reason I had remembered it well, up until I launched it now. While in Jedi Academy I enjoyed almost an every lightsaber fight, in Jedi Outcast I'm willing cut my wrists fighting Reborns or bosses. It's significantly less accurate than Dark Forces 2 saber fighting (and shooting for that matter).\n\nLevel design is pretty good. It's not amazing, but it's not a walk down the corridor all the way. The first levels in the game are the best ones, with the exception of Nar Shaddaa (the only level where the shooting is bearable), while the rest of them (♥♥♥♥ing Bespin) are just a show-off arenas connected with corridors to force more lightsaber fighting and jumping around every corner. At the end of the day, it's nothing to write home about, and the lack of map is sometimes annoying (the previous games have maps).\n\nAnd there's the story. It's a typical expanded universe's mania of writing (stuff from there mostly exists solely to make money from sad, exceptional people who can't define themselves without connecting to a commercial diarrhea) rubbish that destroyed the original Star Wars theme,\n\nIt's not a bad game, not at all, but compared to every other title in the series - it's an obviously sub-par title which got stuck between genres. This game works best on cheats on, off the campaign and off the multiplayer, messing with force powers, cutting enemies in pieces.","May 21, 2015","true","9.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

Usually I play a game and get bored, then I have to switch to another, but not this one. I just made it to the last level and thought this would be a great time to review without spoilers.  You will die a lot and love it. This has to be the best light saber battle game out there right beside Star Wars Jedi Knight Academy. The graphics are a little out of date but still immerse you into the game.\n\nThe story so far is right on spot and has an original feel just like Academy did. The level design is a little crazy because you have to actually figure out how to get places, it's not just a straight line. You have to rely on your senses there is no highlighted or flashing graphics telling you how to progress.\n\nThis is one of those games where you have to save every time you take a step. If not a Sith will jump out behind you and end your existence. At one level in the game you come up to a door and when it opens you are scared to **** by Luke Skywalker. I would let him jump down and kill a Stormtrooper again lol.\n\nI recommend this at regular price and on sale, definitely worth it.","May 10","true","19.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Боясь вновь соблазниться темной стороной Силы, Кайл Катарн отказывается от неё и своего светового меча. Он вновь работает простым наёмником на Новую Республику, вместе с Джен Орс, участвуя в разгроме последних сил имперского Остатка. Во время очередной миссии Кайл и Джен встречают тёмного джедая Десанна, который, узнав известного джедая — победителя грозного Джерека — похищает Джен. Кайл пытается помешать ему, но Десанн легко справляется с ним при помощи Силы и заставляет Кайла убедиться в гибели своей соратницы.\n\nКайл в ярости решает вновь стать джедаем и отправляется в Долину Джедаев, где снова получает Силу. Он не знает, что Десанн все время следил за ним и теперь знает расположение Долины. Кайл же летит на Явин IV, в академию джедаев, чтобы забрать у Люка Скайуокера свой световой меч. Люк заставляет Кайла пройти несколько испытаний, и только затем вручает Катарну его меч. Люк наводит для него справки и помогает выйти на крупного бизнесмена в сфере мусоропереработки, Рило Барука, который помогает Кайлу выйти на след Десанна. На базе Рило Катарн встречает одного из лидеров повстанцев — Лэндо Калриссиана, который находится в плену. Освободив его, герой попадает в Облачный город, где по воле случая встречает Тавион Аксмис — ученицу Десанна. В схватке Кайл побеждает её. Однако перед тем, как Кайл собирался убить её, она успевает раскрыть все планы учителя и то, что Джен живая содержится на флагмане Остатка, «Хозяин судеб». Кайл пощадил её, так как понял, что если в гневе убить Тавион, он может пасть на тёмную сторону.\n\nВ планы Десанна входило с помощью особых технологий создать армию «Возрождённых» (обычные бойцы, искусственным путём наделённые Силой). Собрав немалые силы, имперцы намеревались уничтожить всех джедаев, а также разрушить Долину джедаев. Кайл проникает на флагман и освобождает Джен. Попутно он встречает Люка, который шёл по следам Десанна (не сумел однажды в бою его одолеть). С «Хозяина судеб» Катарн подаёт сигнал флоту Новой республики и истребители уничтожают флагман, а Кайл убивает его командира — Галака Файера.\n\nНа Явине IV Кайл пробирается через джунгли из капсулы, на которой сбежал с погибающего крейсера Остатка. В жестоких боях с «Возрождёнными» погибает немало джедаев. Под Академией Кайл находит Десанна, который воспользовался агрегатом Силы и стал ещё мощнее. Кайл говорит ему о безнадёжности ведения войны, и что все его воины уничтожены. Десанн ему не верит, но связывается с адмиралом. Тот не отвечает, и Десанн приходит в ярость. Он пытается склонить Кайла на тёмную сторону, но в ответ он предлагает Десанну самому вернуться на светлую сторону. Тёмный джедай, придя в ещё большую ярость, включает свой меч и бросается в атаку. В тяжёлой дуэли Кайл одолевает его.\n\nПосле этих событий он с Джен отправляется на отдых, после чего возвращается к преподаванию в академии.","March 22, 2015","true","33.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Боясь вновь соблазниться темной стороной Силы, Кайл Катарн отказывается от неё и своего светового меча. Он вновь работает простым наёмником на Новую Республику, вместе с Джен Орс, участвуя в разгроме последних сил имперского Остатка. Во время очередной миссии Кайл и Джен встречают тёмного джедая Десанна, который, узнав известного джедая — победителя грозного Джерека — похищает Джен. Кайл пытается помешать ему, но Десанн легко справляется с ним при помощи Силы и заставляет Кайла убедиться в гибели своей соратницы.\n\nКайл в ярости решает вновь стать джедаем и отправляется в Долину Джедаев, где снова получает Силу. Он не знает, что Десанн все время следил за ним и теперь знает расположение Долины. Кайл же летит на Явин IV, в академию джедаев, чтобы забрать у Люка Скайуокера свой световой меч. Люк заставляет Кайла пройти несколько испытаний, и только затем вручает Катарну его меч. Люк наводит для него справки и помогает выйти на крупного бизнесмена в сфере мусоропереработки, Рило Барука, который помогает Кайлу выйти на след Десанна. На базе Рило Катарн встречает одного из лидеров повстанцев — Лэндо Калриссиана, который находится в плену. Освободив его, герой попадает в Облачный город, где по воле случая встречает Тавион Аксмис — ученицу Десанна. В схватке Кайл побеждает её. Однако перед тем, как Кайл собирался убить её, она успевает раскрыть все планы учителя и то, что Джен живая содержится на флагмане Остатка, «Хозяин судеб». Кайл пощадил её, так как понял, что если в гневе убить Тавион, он может пасть на тёмную сторону.\n\nВ планы Десанна входило с помощью особых технологий создать армию «Возрождённых» (обычные бойцы, искусственным путём наделённые Силой). Собрав немалые силы, имперцы намеревались уничтожить всех джедаев, а также разрушить Долину джедаев. Кайл проникает на флагман и освобождает Джен. Попутно он встречает Люка, который шёл по следам Десанна (не сумел однажды в бою его одолеть). С «Хозяина судеб» Катарн подаёт сигнал флоту Новой республики и истребители уничтожают флагман, а Кайл убивает его командира — Галака Файера.\n\nНа Явине IV Кайл пробирается через джунгли из капсулы, на которой сбежал с погибающего крейсера Остатка. В жестоких боях с «Возрождёнными» погибает немало джедаев. Под Академией Кайл находит Десанна, который воспользовался агрегатом Силы и стал ещё мощнее. Кайл говорит ему о безнадёжности ведения войны, и что все его воины уничтожены. Десанн ему не верит, но связывается с адмиралом. Тот не отвечает, и Десанн приходит в ярость. Он пытается склонить Кайла на тёмную сторону, но в ответ он предлагает Десанну самому вернуться на светлую сторону. Тёмный джедай, придя в ещё большую ярость, включает свой меч и бросается в атаку. В тяжёлой дуэли Кайл одолевает его.\n\nПосле этих событий он с Джен отправляется на отдых, после чего возвращается к преподаванию в академии.","March 22, 2015","true","33.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badtexture/recommended/6030/","badtexture","Kill-Cam Celebrity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badtexture/","184 products in account","Being the only jedi in the universe to use dark force powers and guns (at least the only one we know of), you're pretty badass with Kyle Katarn.  SHUT UP STARKILLER, MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE PART OF A GOOD GAME AND NOT AN ANIME LOVER'S RENDERING OF HIS LAST SEIZURE.\n\nIts level design is a million times harder than its sequel, Jedi Academy (mostly because of the fact that to start off the game <SPOILER FOR DARK FORES II> Kyle had put away his lightsaber and tossed in the towel on being a Jedi after nearly falling to the dark side).\n\nRunning on the id Engine, it pretty much is an HD DOS shooter now with free mouse movement and full implementation of WASD.  As for its textures, you can see the facial mask on Katarn, I'll say that.  Other than that, the textures and models hold up nicely against newer games still, though some textures are showing their technological age.\n\nIt's very well optimized and other than the fact that it's locked in 4:3 aspect (which can be changed if you read this short and helpful guide for giving yourself widescreen), it's perfectly compatible with new systems.  You don't really need widescreen, though, because even then the game looks fine.  If you like it, though, you should definitely consider its sequel Jedi Academy.\n\nAs for multiplayer, not many people play it.  However, it is there and does have AI that you could possibly be able to customize.  The AI isn't that bad, but I'd still recommend getting a few LAN buddies or playing online with a friend (though you may need Hamachi, I never tried Internet).\n\nIt's very easy to get mods for this game.  You can find all the files in C:\Program Files...\Steam\steamapps\common\Jedi Outcast.  From there you can go to the folder "GameData," then you make a new folder called whatever you want it to be and put the mod(s) files right in the folder.  From the game under options, your mod will now be on the list of mods.\n\nOkay, now back to the topic of graphics: Why haven't newer games tried to accomplish this?  Even if the id Engine 3 didn't have support for normal maps, it still is a very good looking game.  Did you know that your lightsaber has dynamic lighting?  That your lightsaber will also leave streaks and burn lines wherever it touches?  That it has dismemberment/decapitation without blood if you turn it on in the console (also with instructions in a guide)?  This game was high-end.  Other than that, the viewmodels look fine, and there is also a toggle for third person mode.  I turned on an option that automatically goes to third person for any lightsaber combat, and first person for any guns.  This is easy to turn on and extremely useful.\n\nAs for gameplay, everything works perfectly, and come on... the game even has a parkour system as long as you've got a good enough force-jump ability!  There are also plenty of weapons, as well as low-light goggles, storable bacta medkits, and more.  Even before the lightsaber, you get this special lightning baton.\n\n\nIf you're wondering about storyline, it takes place just after the rest of the Dark Forces/Jedi Knight games, which is at this point just after the Empire collapsed to the New Republic (after the 6th episode).\n\nYou should definitely consider getting this game.  Even if you're not a fan of Star Wars, this altogether an awesome game.","June 2, 2014","true","10.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Although this game is older than Jedi Academy, this game is in some aspects even better.\n\n+ You play as Kyle Katarn. He is just a great character and he isn't just a boring monk like some other Jedi. I hope he will star in the next movie.\n+ This game has some great puzzles. But it's only appealing if you like puzzles. Otherwise they show up way too often and are way to hard.\n+ Great variety of different gameplay mechanics. I was impressed what a game this old can offer. There is a stealth mission, you have to use robots and you can awkwardly walk with an AT-ST!\n+ The antagonist works.\n+ I really liked the final mission with the great soundtrack.\n+ the level design sometimes offers different ways to choose from, which was very much appreciated.\n\n- It lasts a while until you get your lightsaber. Although I didn't mind and I understand the importance of character development, other players will be annoyed with this. If this is the case, I recommend you to give Jedi Academy a try.\n- Some puzzles are hard. I had to look up the solution of some problems on the internet several times.\n- The maps are quit complex and you will sometimes desperately wander around the map in order to find the way to go.  I tried to avoid looking up the solution though and I only used it, if i got too frustrated. :D\n- It's sometimes difficult to identify a control panel with a switch from the others without a switch. They look nearly the same. And worse, it's not always clear what the switch was for.\n\nThis is only for die hard Star Wars Fans who liked Jedi Academy and wish to see more of this universe. Wait until its on sale though.","September 7, 2015","true","11.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Sprawling levels full of secrets, fast movement and twitch based aiming are all sadly mostly gone from the modern shooter. Jedi Knight 2 is a throw back to that era, and it is terrible.\n\nLet’s start with the worst offender - The level design, which is just mind blowingly horrible. The first two levels leave you lightsaberless in a selection of featureless bland, grey corridors fighting stormtroopers that mill around like jackbooted schoolkids. The levels are massive, unintuitive mazes with no map screen, and the game constantly breaks it’s own rules – at one point you have to blow up a barrel to burn out a switch. None of the other barrels in the game up until that point have done anything to switches when they blew up nearby, so why the ♥♥♥♥ would this one?\n\nThe weapons, outside of the lethal glowstick are pretty much universally rubbish, a bunch of unsatisfying weightless guffpumpers, made worse by enemy feedback, or the lack of it – they seem to just absorb fire until they remember to keel over dead. The stormtrooper rifle is at least lore accurate – you won’t be hitting ♥♥♥♥ with it unless at point blank range, and even then it’s touch and go. The grenades are laughably terrible as well, exploding with all the force and thunder of a damp dog fart.\n\nIf you grit your teeth through six hours of this, you finally get your lightsaber and some force powers. Things are looking up – you can now cut down fools and reflect blaster shots! The level after your Jedi trial? A city full of narrow walkways and infuriating pixel accurate snipers that can’t be blocked. This is a soul sapping chore, made rage inducing by the god-awful platforming – Kyle Katarn appears to have greased up his shoes, and will fly off a platform at even the slightest prompt. Even more bafflingly, you can prevent this by holding down the use button, necessitating strange hand contortions. Why? What possible reason could the devs have to not have this on at all times? In what situation do you WANT to skid around like you’re moonwalking in a bacon factory?\n\nThere are those that will defend the game based on its story. They are wrong. The cutscenes, featuring terrifying Star Wars mannequins as animated by Monty Python, are at least amusing in their incompetence. Kyle Katarn has always been the universe’s most rubbish Jedi (and he’s got stiff competition post prequels), but here he’s almost painfully uninteresting, a scowling, badly animated beard with a rubbish dead girlfriend.","May 31","false","8.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/recommended/6030/","Brian_Colfxire","Brian C. (The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","Dark Forces 1 & 2 are my favorite Star Wars games, ever. As you imagine with the negative raiting, it's with much dismay to say that I can't even bother finishing Dark Forces 3: Jedi Knight 2 (Jedi Outcast).\n\nBefore you think that I'm complaining about the monotinous beginning, know that I got 4/5 hours in with getting to Bespin. I got the lightsaber and the force-powers, and even then playing this game felt more of a punishment than a reward.\n\nNo matter whatever improvements were made in the Lightsaber gameplay and Force abilities they do not save this game. The level-design is cryptically linear, the story is uninteresting and relies too much on canon, and the game focuses solely on the light-saber combat, making your arsenal worthless.\n\nThe Qualities to Enjoy\nLight-saber combat in 3rd person is superbly refined with more fluid movement.\nForce powers are more conviently selected. (Ex. The Force Jump is just the jump-button held longer.)\nVisuals and scenary can still be enjoyable for what they are.\nThe multiplayer gameplay is very entertaining for what little I played, but I hear that Jedi Academy is where the fans play online with more popularity. (As well as mods.)\nThe Outcast from Dark Forces\nNothing about this game other than Kyle Katarn is reminiscent of the previous games' quality. It's an entirely different game that looks, sounds and plays the same, but it all a facade for a tech-demo thinking it's an improvement to the series.\n\nThat sounds like a lot of nostalgia talking, doesn't it?\n\nWell, no; I can say for certain that the two games are more different than alike because I played them alongside one-another: I got about 4 hours into Jedi Knight 2 before I decided to boot up Jedi Knight 1 for about two hours. (Know that I hadn't played the game for over a year, and I'm sure I do not have that good of a memory).\n\nIn about two hours from JK 1, I was already equipped with my light-saber and happily making it through the dam area mixing up my combat style with blasters and the light-saber. By hour two of JK2, I was looking up an IGN wiki guide because I didn't realize there was an explosive barrel unseen to blow the entrance to the next area.\n\nIt then occurred to me that no matter how lost I got in JK1, I never recall ever looking up a guide. Because the level-design guided me, subtly, the same way the player is guided in a game like Half-Life where environments and visual cues told this information to the player. (Also, I had a map on me to figure out my location if I ever lost my way.)\n\nBoth of those qualities are absent in JK2. Something I cannot but help to attribute to a change of developers from LucasArts to Raven Software during LA's change from making games to licencing them.\n\nIn JK2, you have no map, period; no briefing to show the map or an in-game map to help. And far too often you'll have to blow up this wall from a specific corner, to jump into a trash-compactor to get to the other side, or to do something so convuluted it ruins any sense of exploration.\n\nWhat makes JK2 worse is how it has detached itself from its Doom/Dark Forces roots of exploring out of necessity for healh, items and ammo. You'll typically find everything littered on the floors, especially health and shield-stations. (Not that you'll need a lot of ammo once you get the light-saber.)\n\nAnother major change is how the lightsaber is so vital that I think it's to the detriment of the game. Except for the sniper-rifle which is used for those cheap sharp-shooters who can see you a mile away, the game sends enemies at you with large amounts of health that the light-saber becomes essential as an offensive and defensive weapon.\n\nCombine the light-saber with the Force abilities to knock down or disperse enemies--which are no longer unlocked by your choices but automatically unlocked for you--and the game quickly becomes stale by the constant woosh of the lightsaber. (Admittedly, the visceral sound of the lightsaber is the best thing about JK2.)\n\nThese changes, combined with the smaller level designs, all serve to disappoint any fan who became fond of the first two games (and expansion) because they sacrifice the complexity of the old games for the sake of graphic and gameplay enhancements.\n\nAn Arsenal of One is An Arsenal of None\nThe thing about JK2 that surprised me the most is how quickly I became tired of using the lightsaber. Far too often I found that running around and slashing through enemies would be the best strategy for winning.\n\nOutside of the Sniper Rifle for those cheap snipers that can spot you a mile away, the weapons you find become a deteriment to you than a benefit. It's interesting how both games have the exact same combat and guns, but small tweaks to the gameplay completely change what is the best playstyle.\n\nIf there are tons of enemies, you cannot move around as nimbly as in JK1 (without spamming the Speed ability) to make range combat useful. Also, despite how "accurate" the Stormtroopers' fire their weapons, the enemy AI simply do not account for you mowing through them with the lightsaber or have enemy types to discourage you running into gunfire.\n\nFor example, in JK 1 the Probes were typically placed far away or would explode when you destroyed them that taking them out by other means was always the better option. The only enemy that is potentially a hazard when running into are the grenaders, which can be easily remedied by using Force Push/Pull.\n\n(The exception being the snipers, which are so cheap that running past them can sometimes be the better solution for the terrible sniper controls.)\n\nAs much as I love the improved lightsaber combat, I think it's another reason why you wont part with it because you can rely on blocking most attacks (not relying as much on your aim like JK1.)\n\nI'm sure had I pushed farther I would have used the rocket-launcher on some enemy groups or bosses, but this change goes to show how something similar in concept has been changed without paying attention to what was done before.\n\nAnother Star Wars Game That Can't Forget About Star Wars\nThis is a more subjective criticism, but I hate how much JK2 serves to fall back on canon to make the story interesting. Luke Skywalker, Lando, Bespin, Yavin are all just thrown into Kyle Katarn's story for the sake of giving the plot any interest.\n\nThe original Dark Forces had the right idea: Introduce a beginning that ties into the canon, relate that to the audience with the new character, and then create a new story. Jedi Knight 1 also understood this was the best solution for making a Star Wars game refreshing by having a mention of Skywalker and the story of the Valley of the Jedi as the focus.\n\nJK2 decides to have you wander around Skywalker's Academy as well as talking to him, and then later fighting alongside him with dozens of Dark Jedi (the only reason I may continue some later day.) You have a similar meet-up with Lando.\n\nI would be fine with these fan-services had Katarn's story been given anything interesting. In short, the game gives him another revenge story where he walks along the path of a Jedi/Sith. (Except there is no good/bad ending, something I'm not going to complain about because the good endings were always the real ending.)\n\nThe plot only serves to put him back on the path of a Jedi when he decided to give it up after he was corrupted from the Dark Side. That's the only inclusion of Outcast that I appreciate as it keeps the focus on Katarn, and not the series itself, but I can't help to question if it was for nothing.\n\nSomewhere There's Still Good in Him...\nI'm mad that I cannot enjoy this game as other fans. The reinfinements to the gameplay, albeit some floaty movement controls, serve to remind me that if I could look past the game's lacking qualities I could find something to love.","January 19","false","7.0"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lirujenkins/recommended/6030/","lirujenkins","Liru","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lirujenkins/","166 products in account","If you want to ice-skate around pitch black hallways looking for that obscure barrel or button that blends in perfectly with the scenery while enemies peck away at your health with hit-scan weapons and grenades, this is perfect for you.\n\nI honestly can't see the fun in this, usually games play off their strengths and you can overlook the weaknesses, but in this game it plays completely off its weaknesses. You spend the first few hours walking around hallways looking for buttons that blend in with the scenery perfectly, by the time you learn what the button generally looks like they change it, you don't get the lightsaber in these few hours, you just spray wildly at things right infront of you. There's a decent Doom-like progression of weapons which leads you to believe you'll be using them a lot, you won't. I used the pistol and bowcaster once, the E-11 and sniper are the only blaster-type weapons I needed.\n\nOnce you get the lightsaber, you will be pumped, you will want to hack/slash and duel, you will want to master it. Too bad, from this moment on you're against bombers who drop a grenade on death and snipers whose shots can't be deflected by the lightsaber, so you'll be sticking with blasters yet again, but atleast you own the lightsaber now. You will also be doing a lot of jumping puzzles, this is absolute hell because your character is on rollerskates and when you land you slide a bit thus falling off platforms is an easy thing to do. Yet there are a number of jumping puzzles in this game, as I said, they're playing off the weaknesses.\n\nThe level design is even worse, I ended up watching a walkthrough where the guy doing the walkthrough had to stop to look up a walkthrough. I managed to get up to the waste disposal part before getting too frustrated, I had to blow up a random barrel that could only be shot via a grate and it made me realise I didn't have the patience. there are a lot of trip mines in random places for no other reason than to kill you for not noticing. My first 5 minutes of this game was walking into a store room to instantly blow up, it forces you to save every 5 minutes (each save seems to go to a new file, so have fun with that).\n\nThe game supports 2k resolution, yet not 1080p, it hates multiple monitors and I can't change the brightness to actually see what I'm doing. I installed this on my SSD yet it takes 10 seconds to load a save which gets frustrating when you're constantly loading a save before a stupid jump or an encounter with an oddly placed bomber and if you alt-tab it will constantly put itself infront of everything else making the essential task of looking at a walkthrough that much harder.\n\nI can't say the same for the other games I bought in the bundle, but I'd give this one a miss, I've read that there's a forced stealth segment coming up so my hopes of it getting better were severely misguided.","February 14","false","7.2"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","7","16","2","0"

You can not create your own character, and are stuck in the least interesting character of the previous installment: Kyle. Secondly, you don't get a lightsaber. Not until you passed several, long levels in a 1st person shooter with elements of a platform and puzzle game. All the way through the levels, I wondered if I should google a cheatcode to get "what I bought the game for". I kept feeling like these levels would be fun with a Jedi Knight and a lightsaber. But apparently, this Jedi Knight installment is not about being a Jedi Knight.\nOnly later, is a Lightsaber acquired and the first level they put you in is a turkey shootout with snipers and grenade launchers where a lightsaber can't save you. Even on easy mode, quite a few of these weapons will kill you in 1 or 2 shots.\nAdd in frequent deaths because an elevator, or a door killed you. Add in a few deaths to test if you "can make that jump" because the road isn't clear. Add in longer, but now uninterruptable dialogue sequences.\nI quit the game and wonder if I'll ever bother to complete it. Perhaps the second half of the game levels is worth it, but after several hours of play it still lacks the laser swinging fun I was hoping to find.","January 3","false","8.8"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

(Not sure if Inquisition is like KOTOR as I have not tried it.)\nBattlefront is like Battlefield but more lasers to it.\nAnd Jedi Academy is like this game but far less frustrating (my opinion) and far better game mechanics and force power including force sence which somtimes gives you a hint of what you can do.\n\nBut still if you really want to play this game I suggest that you spend a little time checking through the controls especially check where is the quick save/load keys so you don't have to play from that checkpoint which was like 30mins ago and may the force be with you.\n\nThis was not the game I was looking for.","October 2, 2015","false","12.4"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","10","1","10","2","1"

That said, everything else (including the puzzles) can be bull**** and downright stupid at times. On some missions it will give you more items and health and armour than you will need, on others, the opposite. Unlike other puzzlers of the time, this games puzzles are unclear, there is never a straight path or solid answer. Also, sidenote, you have to go through 3 chapters to get your light sabre and force powers. 3!!! You know, they say three is the magic number, but in this case, it just f**ken isn't. Combat is repetative, your light sabre feels more like a wooden stick than a focused plasma beam, normal is next to impossible (there is no way I am trying the other difficulties. No. Way), story is reasonably good but is overshadowed by the sheer bull**** of the gameplay. Apart from that, fighting your way through levels with either a blaster or light sabre is really fun.\nTo anyone trying to get into the Star Wars line of games, don't start with this one. It's not quite Dark Souls level of punishing but its reasonably close. Wait until it is on sale, if you have your heart set on getting this game.\nI can only truly recommend this to true fans of the Star Wars genre. And if you can look past all the layers of 'F**K YOU' on top, you may even enjoy this game.\nBut for anyone else, this is a miss. Watch a playthough on youtube if you really must know the story, but please don't go though the trauma that is this game. Believe me. Dark Souls or Bloodborne are more rewarding experiences than this game.\nFinal verdict: Fun enough for a while, but if you want to play for any long period of time, familiarise yourself with how to cheat in-game (because some of the levels are so close to being incomplete that it would litterally take you an hour to get through it legitly). Don't play if you are a first to Star Wars games. Start with something like Battlefront (new or old) or force unleashed.\nStar Wars Jedi Knight II - Jedi Outcast A.K.A.

You twist, you turn, you almost feel as if the saber is an extension of kyle's body. You block shots with it, you lop body parts off - it's nearly perfect. Sadly, you don't get it until a couple of missions in, but the saber shenangians are the best part of this game.\n\nMultiplayer, when anyone uses it, is a blast, but you're better served by the (misleadingly named) Jedi Knight Academy, which is actually a sequel to this game.\n\nHeadshotting stormtroopers never gets old, neither does doing the same with the mouthy "die rebel scum" blackshirts.\n\nOverall, the game is very fun, and I really wanted to like it, but unfortunately...\n\nThe BadThe game starts out excellent (raiding an Empire base), but just about everything after the first mission is an exercise in bad level design and frustration - learn and love the quicksave/quickload keys because it's very easy to take a wrong step and find yourself redoing half the level.\n\nCheckpoints are too far away from each other - a death, unless you're save scumming, means repeating substantial sections of levels.\n\nThe music. It's the Star Wars music you all know and love, but the problem is *that's all* there is. Every single event in the game is set to the orchestral soundtrack from the original trilogy. It's rather unimaginative, and in many cases, ruins the mood.\n\nDifficulty is all over the place. The first mission is a cakewalk, the third is a ragefest. (Insta-kill snipers pls go and stay go)\n\nGraphics are remarkably dated, and requires file hacks to enable widescreen support.\n\nNobody plays the multiplayer.\n\nOverall\nA good game irrevocably stuck in the shell of a poorly designed one.

Skipped it back in the day for reasons I don't recall (The Prequel-trilogy is involved, possibly). And I think, I haven't missed much.\n\nAfter the glorious masterpieces that are Dark Forces and the original Jedi Knight, Jedi Outcast is a pretty severe disappointment in comparison.\n\nFirst of all: the basic story of the game feels like bad fan fiction. It's like merging storylines of the first games and adding a whole bunch of idiotic, one-dimensional original characters nobody cares about. Especially Desann is incredibly poorly done and one of the lamest Star Wars villain ever (also makes for a pitiful final boss) and I was constantly thinking about that Star Fox Adventure game when I saw him. The whole story also isn't engaging or told in a way that I give a damn - quite the departure from Dark Forces and Jedi Knight, which both managed to keep my interest going thanks to some quality cutscenes, bits of narrative that I was actually looking forward to see. Jedi Outcast goes on and on about meaningless ♥♥♥♥ to cover up that you are about to actually do meaningless ♥♥♥♥ and presents that in some of the stiffest ingame cutscenes I have ever seen. There is never any real tension or drama, it's really not compelling because you are not attached to any of the characters - instead they rely on cameos by Luke or Lando to win you over. They also screwed with the characters themselves, particularly Kyle and Jan have changed personalities and are nothing like their Dark Forces I&II counterparts, particularly Jan's role got reduced from badass fighter pilot to damsel in distress. Weak and disappointing.\n\nThe mission design ties into this - Dark Forces and Jedi Knight had several objectives per Mission - once the Level is complete, scenery and objectives change. This helped keeping things fresh. Jedi Outcast drags on and on in each and every scenario. You are basically playing just one mission, but it feels it's like 3-5 levels of the same ♥♥♥♥ before the textures slightly change. It gets very samey, very quickly. The objectives themselves are also very boring - there is never anything clever about the mission goals or the areas they are in. It's mostly just flipping switches and grabbing keys, hopefully not missing that one grate that is out of the way and allows access to some random ♥♥♥ vent that will possibly lead you to a room that you don't even know existed.\n\nAnd that leads us to my main problem with the game. The map design is unbelievably bad compared to Dark Forces and Jedi Knight. There is just no flow to any of this - Jedi Knight in particular would lead you to areas and you would get an idea how things are connected and rooms are located relative to your position, levels themselves felt like their was some logic behind them. It also didn't went out of it's way to confuse you (most of the times, anyway) and rooms had distinct layouts and textures to mark them as important as well as help you navigate the more complex structures. Jedi Outcast almost lacks all of that. I got stuck in several areas because I missed near impossibly to see grates or small tunnels (examples include a walkway between elevator shafts, several grates in various off-track small rooms in areas I had already visited and a particular underwater tunnel on Yavin IV).  There is a lot of back tracking involved too, and several occasions where you have access to several areas but lack the information regarding the current problem and what you might be looking for (which gets worse, when certain things are scripted and throw you off completely because you might have tried X but tried it before it was actually ment to be done). It is all rather limiting and I never felt really smart or good about it when I finally figured out what to do or what I had missed - because a lot of it was just luck and running in circles instead of actually understanding the map (something that both Dark Forces and Jedi Knight managed to do). As such, the thing I got the most fun out of in the earlier games, was the reason for much frustration in this game - it's just not fun exploring these levels (especially not since they limit your force powers early on - you get to see and play what they want you to see and play and that's that).\n\nFinally, movement and combat - let me say this: I can imagine that this game is a blast in multiplayer. However, I only bothered with the campaign and I am not convinced. First of all, the movement is super-floaty, more so than in the prequels. Navigating certain ledges was a pain in the ♥♥♥. And don't get me started on Force Jumping and narrow ledges or platforms - for some reason Kyle would bounce of like a pinball when hitting obstacles or the ceiling, making him miss crucial jumps and resulting in joyless quicksave/quickload marathons until I got it right (entering that Rogue Squadron code in the communication array was a real pain in that regard). They also ruined Force Speed. It should be called Force SlowMotion instead. Maybe the wanted to pull some Matrix-♥♥♥♥ off with that one, but the changed behaviour of that particular force power made one of my favourite non-combat abilities next to useless. You don't really run faster during the majority of the game (if you do, it certainly didn't feel or look that way). Pointless.  Saber Throw is another thing I didn't get quite right - no idea why, but it took me 60 tries during the initial training to cut some stupid ropes, eventhough the lightsaber was clearly cutting through the rope. It would later do some odd ♥♥♥♥ as well and be a somewhat imprecise tool to work with. Not cool (or fun).\n\nDon't get me wrong though, lightsaber combat and force powers are the sole reason you don uninstall this game right away - with added "realistic lightsaber combat" and "dismemberment" there is plenty of entertainment to be had when force pulling enemies and cutting them in half mid-air, decapitating and cutting of limbs as you slash through rows of alien scum and storm troopers or knocking the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s off their feet and see them squirm on the ground as they try to get up when you just slash down and end their miserable existence forever. In reality however, most battles ended up being a clickfest and all the tools, toys and styles you get weren't half as effective as just mashing away. Though, there is plenty of possiblities to style in this game and I believe combat is deeper than fighting the AI makes you think. It ain't no Dark Souls combat or Devil May Cry but it's way more playable than the lightsaber duels in Jedi Knight.\n\nAnnoyingly, the gunplay is totally borked and no fun at all. Most enemies take way too many shots, the majority of weapons are boring and once you got your lightsaber you want to stick with it as much as possible. Your mileage may vary, but I enjoyed my blaster fire the most in Dark Forces, Jedi Knight was already getting worse - but Jedi Outcast is really bad. Considering Raven has done a fair share of shooters, this was quite surprising.\n\nLet me wrap it up by saying that if you haven't played Jedi Outcast yet, don't bother - sure, lightsaber action is good and all, certainly better than the original Jedi Knight - but pretty much every other aspect is worse. Story, leveldesign, creativity - Jedi Outcast turned out to be a largely forgettable single player experience. You are definitely better off playing Dark Forces and Jedi Knight.","November 14, 2015","false","10.6"," 3 of 15 people (20%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","20","3","15","2","3"

Played Dark Forces, Jedi Knight I, and Jedi Knight III. I've heard great things about it, but... it's really broken on modern machines. Like, entirely broken, unable to function properly if you have certain configurations, and impossible to fix. The game is clunky, likes to crash, doesn't deal with widescreen well, and after a few hours of trying to get it to cooperate cleanly, I gave up. I know there is a quality FPS experience to be had here, but I don't happen to have a copy of XP with an older computer laying around.\n\nI've seen people get the game running, and I know there are guides to get it running cleanly, but I never quite got around to trying to make it work, despite following PCGamingWiki, steam forums, and other sources of information. Did a few .ini things, played with some config files, tried unofficial patches, and then I eventually gave up after it crashed when I opened a door.\n\nI came to find out that It doesn't work, period, if you have a newer AMD card with newer drivers (Catalsyt 13.2 or higher), no matter what you do. It doesn't like to cooperate with multi-cored systems. If you try to play it in widescreen, the FOV will get messed up, and if you try to adjust the FOV, you'll crash randomly. If you try to rebind keys, you might end up with a white screen. If you try to run it in a compatibility mode, it'll either work fine (If you have an NVIDIA card) or it'll hard-lock your computer.\n\nIf you happen to have an older laptop laying around, or an old desktop for whatever reason, you should be fine. If you have an NVIDIA GPU rather than an AMD GPU, you should also be okay, I think. I can't personally test it. I do sincerely wish I could play it, but I can't recommend it in the state it is in. It's an old game that doesn't want to work properly, unfortunately. Every other Jedi Knight game plays relatively well, but this one just doesn't like to work...

That was a mistake on my part when I made a comparison at one point.)\n\n(EDIT 2: I have posted a video at the bottom that very briefly demonstrates the shifting position of the crosshair.)\n\nIt's time to face an uncomfortable truth: no game is perfect. I tried as hard as I could to enjoy Jedi Outcast, and I tried more than once. It's unfortunate, but if you are curious about what problems this game might have, you are about to find them all listed in one place.\n\nOne of my first irritations was trying to aim. Your reticle does not stay in the center of the screen: it shifts between the center and the lower right corner depending on the distance of your target. This greatly complicates aiming. Many enemies move around wildly, and your weapons have very slow moving projectiles that usually don't do much damage unless you can get one of those exceptionally tricky headshots. Both you and your target will be moving, so when you combine that with the shifting reticle and slow projectiles, hitting anything at all is an extreme challenge. I have often missed targets at nearly point blank range because the reticle was never where I expected it to be. Bear in mind that you will be shooting for the first large chunk of the game.\n\nOne of the most appealling aspects of the game is lightsaber combat. And I found that to be little more fun than shooting. The very first level after you get your lightsaber pits you against snipers -which can't be blocked with your lightsaber- and grenadiers -which your lightsaber not only doesn't protect you against, but I remember it actually detonating the grenades. Timing your swings is tricky, so you might take a shot before you actually kill your target.\n\nAnd then there is lightsaber vs lightsaber combat. And I was never able to figure that out. (This coming from a lover of Dark Messiah of Might and Magic and Severence: Blade of Darkness.) The Jedi Outcast tries to replicate the look of (highly correographed) lightsaber combat in the movies, and what we get is hard to read. What I would end up doing was trying to always keep the enemy in front of me and keep using force heal. By the way, do you remember those attacks your lightsaber won't protect you from? Like explosives and sniper shots? Enemies with lightsabers are immune to such attacks from you.\n\nForce powers try to spice combat up. But gone are force choke, force drain, and other useful abilities from Jedi Acadamy. (Not to mention the ability to immediately level up your force heal and skip the very worst levels.) In fact, you get less combos in general than you did in Jedi Academy.\n\nJedi Outcast features the most monumentally confusing level design I have ever seen. It is clear that none of the levels were designed to be like a place that would have had an actual function for actual people before your character shows up. Rather, levels tend to be slightly abstract. One problem is that there are often several similar rooms copied and pasted together, making environments more confusing and repetitive. Jedi Outcast delights in making it unclear what you have to do to progress through the game. I would literally get stuck for 30 minutes and then achieve progress only by shooting a random thing out of my frustration or boredom. There were usually no visual cues at all that I was supposed to shoot said thing, and these incidents happened many times. I have said before that if Valve designed these levels, there would be honorable suicides taking place.\n\nAnd now for the most frustrating mechanic by far in the game, the mandatory stealth section. If one enemy sees you and presses an alarm, you immediately get a cutscene of Mr. Katarn getting executed. There was literally no reason that I couldn't have sliced out everyone's nipples except the game wanting to pis me off. This section contains the type of hyperlinear gameplay executing the player for not guessing what specific thing they had to do to avoid execution that frustrates me in modern military shooter campaigns. The elephant in this particular room is that stealth mechanics don't really exist in Jedi Outcast. As Kyle announced the beggining of the mandatory stealth section, my already high frustration immediately spiked yet higher. At my first feel of this section, I immediately decided that the game had tested my patience in too many other ways, so I cheated past that part in the hope that the game would begin to get fun after that.\n\nIt never did. I reached a point where I fought three lightsaber wielding enemies simultaneously, and I gave up. I'm pretty sure the game was not going to get better after that point, and even if it did it would be far too late for that.\n\nShooting is broken, lightsaber combat is broken, and level design is broken. What is left? Storyline? First off, the enjoyability of a game's story is always going to be bottlenecked by the quality of the gameplay because you must play the game to progress through the story. Ignoring that, what is the story? That joke of a leftover empire does things, and we contrive a way to have an army of red lightsaber wielders. Just like in Jedi Academy. And this constantly contriving armies of red lightsaber wielders in Star Wars games rings a bit as B.S.\n\nEvery time I try to play it again, I always rediscover frustrations that I hadn't quite commited to memory; there are too many for me to remember all of them. I literally consider Jedi Outcast to be the worst first person shooter I have ever played. (Haven't played Revelations 2012, Rogue Warrior, or Garry's Incident mind you.)\n\nNow, the vast majority of players say this game is awesome, and it has nearly a top tier metacritc score. For those reasons, I can't guarantee that you will hate this game like I do. But if you do pick up Jedi Outcast and find it to be one of your most frustrating experiences in gaming, I just want you to know that I called it.\n\nHere's that wierd thing the crosshair does:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytB4m_RR4c0","November 27, 2013","false","16.0"," 24 of 104 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","24","104","0","18"

It doesn't go that well, the main problem it's the level design and overall level quality, for a game that it's obsessed with making "maze like levels" they just aren't that intuitive and it almost seems like the designers tried to deliberatly make the game much more complex that what it needed to be, but it it's the complexity the one that drives me crazy, it's the way it's executed, the game never tries to be friendly with the player, it always force you down to absurd and tedious cutscenes that don't add anything new, the characters are never present and because of this you never really develop any kind of simpathy for them. It seems that it wasn't until it's sequel when the designers realize a different more, "easy and simple", approach.\nThere were literally times that made me wish to just turn the game off and go do something that wasn't as tedious or annoying as getting lost constantly into the gigantic levels. It just never feels smart or seductive, it just follows a pattern of self destruction that doesn't lead to nothing more than the absurd desire of creating mind bendling puzzles into the mind of the player, however this are not the kind of ones that i like, and they probrably never will.","May 24, 2014","false","11.6"," 5 of 53 people (9%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","9","5","53","0","1"

I don't want the game to hand hold me or making it obvious, but it would be nice if the game had more clear direction of what to do. You will need a walkthrough to help you with some of the levels.\n\nThe second reason is the game is frustrating. You will die many cheap deaths.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aristotrash/recommended/6030/","aristotrash","Aristotrash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aristotrash/","80 products in account","What is it about Jedi Outcast that makes it worth revisiting 13 years on (and counting)?\n\nIts predecessor, Dark Forces II, was the last great Star Wars title to be developed in house by LucasArts, at a time when the studio was just at the peak of its creative powers and not yet in decline.  We might even remember DFII as the best shooter of the 1990s, were it not for a little game by Valve that came out just over a year later in 1998.\n\nOf course, 4.5 years is an eternity in gaming.  By the time Jedi Outcast hit market in 2002, LucasArts' catchet had taken some major hits, thanks to post-Episode I Star Wars titles that were lazy cash grabs at worst (Jedi Power Battles) or disappointing failures at best (*cough*Force Commander*cough*).  Jedi Outcast was developed by a third party, Raven Software, using the Quake III engine; gone are the quirks and charms of the proprietary engines that powered the earlier games in the Dark Forces series.  Moreover, there's a definite emphasis on straight-up action, rather than the vertiginous, puzzle-filled vibe of the first two titles.\n\nSo why is this game so much damn fun?\n\nAlthough JO takes a while to hit the ground running with its blaster-only prologue missions, there's an immensely satisfying payoff once the player begins Jedi training.  If wielding the lightsaber for the first time in JK:DFII was a cool feeling, then in JO it was absolutely mind blowing: there is a level of fluidity, control, and power that is unique to Raven's treatment of the lightsaber here, and it's apparent from the moment you first use it.  One can honestly say, even after all these years, that there has never been an objectively better representation of lightsaber combat in a Star Wars game,\n\nAnd the Force powers?  While some players will miss JK:DFII's RPG-lite system, which allowed one to invest in some powers instead of others, it has to be said that Raven took an interesting approach here: not only are most of the iconic powers retained (push, pull, jump, speed, choke, lightning, etc.), but the leveling is handled so discreetly that it's hard not to be impressed by how POWERFUL you really are late in the game -- and, wow, is it a treat to take down entire rooms of enemies with nothing but your saber, the Force, and the extremely tight controls you'd expect of a Quake III-powered game.\n\nThe story is hardly award winning stuff, but it's conveyed effectively within the gameplay itself.  As a result, JO has a solid momentum that builds in intensity as the game progresses, until the player is continuing on just to see what crazy cool thing they'll get to do next.  (DO, not WATCH; take note, present-day devs.)\n\nThrow in a multiplayer mode that's just about everything you'd want a sabers-and-Force-powers multiplayer experience to be, and there's not much else to say about this game.  Raven might not have made a 1:1 follow-up to the Dark Forces games -- how could they? -- but they more than made up for it by delivering the most exciting Jedi action yet seen in the series, or really any Star Wars title.  I still fire this game up once every several years just to see how it's aged, and each time I'm impressed by how much of a blast it still is.  It's not mere nostalgia at work; it's quality design and honest fun delivered by a talented group of people who set out to capture a very specific kind of action-gaming experience, all while remaining true to the spirit of a classic game series.\n\nIf you're a Star Wars fan, or even just a shooter fan looking for something slightly different, this is really one of the most entertaining titles out there.  This game lives up to its pedigree in a big way.","January 30, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aristotrash/recommended/6030/","aristotrash","Aristotrash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aristotrash/","80 products in account","What is it about Jedi Outcast that makes it worth revisiting 13 years on (and counting)?\n\nIts predecessor, Dark Forces II, was the last great Star Wars title to be developed in house by LucasArts, at a time when the studio was just at the peak of its creative powers and not yet in decline.  We might even remember DFII as the best shooter of the 1990s, were it not for a little game by Valve that came out just over a year later in 1998.\n\nOf course, 4.5 years is an eternity in gaming.  By the time Jedi Outcast hit market in 2002, LucasArts' catchet had taken some major hits, thanks to post-Episode I Star Wars titles that were lazy cash grabs at worst (Jedi Power Battles) or disappointing failures at best (*cough*Force Commander*cough*).  Jedi Outcast was developed by a third party, Raven Software, using the Quake III engine; gone are the quirks and charms of the proprietary engines that powered the earlier games in the Dark Forces series.  Moreover, there's a definite emphasis on straight-up action, rather than the vertiginous, puzzle-filled vibe of the first two titles.\n\nSo why is this game so much damn fun?\n\nAlthough JO takes a while to hit the ground running with its blaster-only prologue missions, there's an immensely satisfying payoff once the player begins Jedi training.  If wielding the lightsaber for the first time in JK:DFII was a cool feeling, then in JO it was absolutely mind blowing: there is a level of fluidity, control, and power that is unique to Raven's treatment of the lightsaber here, and it's apparent from the moment you first use it.  One can honestly say, even after all these years, that there has never been an objectively better representation of lightsaber combat in a Star Wars game,\n\nAnd the Force powers?  While some players will miss JK:DFII's RPG-lite system, which allowed one to invest in some powers instead of others, it has to be said that Raven took an interesting approach here: not only are most of the iconic powers retained (push, pull, jump, speed, choke, lightning, etc.), but the leveling is handled so discreetly that it's hard not to be impressed by how POWERFUL you really are late in the game -- and, wow, is it a treat to take down entire rooms of enemies with nothing but your saber, the Force, and the extremely tight controls you'd expect of a Quake III-powered game.\n\nThe story is hardly award winning stuff, but it's conveyed effectively within the gameplay itself.  As a result, JO has a solid momentum that builds in intensity as the game progresses, until the player is continuing on just to see what crazy cool thing they'll get to do next.  (DO, not WATCH; take note, present-day devs.)\n\nThrow in a multiplayer mode that's just about everything you'd want a sabers-and-Force-powers multiplayer experience to be, and there's not much else to say about this game.  Raven might not have made a 1:1 follow-up to the Dark Forces games -- how could they? -- but they more than made up for it by delivering the most exciting Jedi action yet seen in the series, or really any Star Wars title.  I still fire this game up once every several years just to see how it's aged, and each time I'm impressed by how much of a blast it still is.  It's not mere nostalgia at work; it's quality design and honest fun delivered by a talented group of people who set out to capture a very specific kind of action-gaming experience, all while remaining true to the spirit of a classic game series.\n\nIf you're a Star Wars fan, or even just a shooter fan looking for something slightly different, this is really one of the most entertaining titles out there.  This game lives up to its pedigree in a big way.","January 30, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Me and a buddy bought this game back in 02'. I had never played any other Jedi knight title prior to Jedi Outcast and as a Star Wars fan I had high expectations. The game did not disappoint, it was, and still is, a fantastic experience. Not only is it a excellent Star Wars narrative but the gameplay is superb too. I loved trying to take out a reborn using the wookie crossbow in 1st person then instantly switching to 3rd person to finish the job with a forcepull and a heavy swing of my lightsaber.

It has the same fun combat (with a lightsaber, many other Star Wars weapons, and Force powers) that made Jedi Knight such a good game, and it this time it has 21st century graphics, legitimately good voice acting, and a stronger story. It's in the period when Luke's Jedi were headquartered on Yavin 4, and it pits Kyle Katarn against a really great set of new villains while sending him to a lot of iconic Star Wars locations. Unfortunately, the platforming which has been my bane throughout the series is still here. If you love platforming, that will be a plus, but for me, it's the one thing I don't like about this game. (Of course, you can save at any time, so at least it's manageable).\nI'd say this is the third-best Star Wars shooter ever made (right after Battlefront II and Republic Commando). If you are a Star Wars fan (especially an Expanded Universe lover like me), and/or enjoyed previous games in the Dark Forces/ Jedi Knight series, I recommend this game. If you're interested in the Jedi Knight games but don't want to play something with extremely dated graphics, then this is my recommended jumping-in point.","January 21, 2015","true","43.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As of this review, he has about 26 hours played of this game, and not once in the entire time he's owned it has he thought to mention to me how great of a game this is! I had to find this out on my own recently (heard about it through other sources but wasn't certain I'd like it). Purchased it, installed it, love it!\n\nMy memories of playing the original Dark Forces had prepared me for what I was sure to be dated graphics, but I think they hold up quite well. Much better than I was expecting honestly. Smooth animations coupled with the authentic blaster and droid sounds have made my first foray into this game incredible (and I haven't even got a lightsaber yet!) A word of caution though, this game will not hold your hand. I'm talking Doom-era "go activate this terminal somewhere in this level that might look a lot like the dozen other terminals, and make sure you have the right passkey for this door" puzzle solving.\n\nTL:DR I may not be talking to my brother for awhile.

The singleplayer is a cross-over of what you would expect from old FPS titles like Doom with a star wars twist and not so much random power-up drops.\nI do not have enough hours logged on Steam that this game deserves, mostly because Steam keeps stealing money out of my wallot.\nThe only issues with purchasing the game now is that there is not many resolution formats and the multiplayer is dead amongst pubs. You can still battle the bots and play with your friends as well as modding the game. There is not as many mods for JK2:JO as there is for its sequel Jedi Academy.  This still does not deter me from going back and playing this time and time again, whether it is on PC or Gamecube.\n\nIn conclusion, you should highly consider picking up this game.

While the AI of enemies remains mediocre, the sheer visceral nature of the gameplay, particularly the fluid, acutely-controlled lightsaber combat and the brilliant authenticity of the sights and sounds of the Star Wars universe should suck in any player with even a remote interest in the film series, granting a playthrough chock-full of fast-paced, against-the-odds combat that will leave everyone craving more.\n\nIn contrast to the standalone expansion pack Mysteries of the Sith, Jedi Outcast's story is relatively concrete. Kyle Katarn, left war of the dark side of the Force, gives up his Jedi powers, remaining a mercenary for the fledging New Republic with his partner, Jan Ors. When Jan is taken from him, however, Kyle returns to Luke Skywalker's Jedi Academy and takes up a lightsaber once more, taking on the Imperial Remnant and uncovering that threatens to overthrow the Republic and crush the fledging New Jedi Order.\n\nIf you're looking for an authentic, brilliant Star Wars game, it's hard to recommend anything other than the Jedi Knight series, and this game in particular. Though the Quake 3 engine had indeed aged quite a bit, the game should run relatively well on modern platforms. And hey, if you're eager for more Force-wielding action? Forget The Force Unleashed; pick up Jedi Academy and sink your teeth in.","March 10, 2014","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Besides that detail, the maps and some of the puzzles can be quite confusing and that is a very effective way to screw up with someone's patience (at least that's what I think). Either way, the more that you advance in the game, the better it gets. Even though I still think that Jedi Academy is a much better option while compared to this one, it surely deserves a share of attention. That's because besides the campaign, the multiplayer mode is quite awesome, I've spent a whole lot of time on it, even fighting against bots. By the way, that's the sort of game that can get extremely funny if you happen to turn on the cheats in certain places (especially to put you inside of places that you're never supposed to reach).

Jedi Outcast is a great game with a great story that somehow retains replayability, all while feeling very Star Warsy.

A game from time where cover and reload didn't exist.\n\nTL;DR :-\n\nGame totally worth it if bought on sale, the only reason I think 11.99 is a bit overpriced is because the game is old. If compared to todays (Indie?) game's worth the same price JK II might not come on top. It is fun and a must buy if you like lightsaber and/or wish to play a game with good lightsaber mechanics.\n\n"Buy the game, worth the bucks if bought in a sale. But don't expect it to be easy, there is a good chance that if you manage not to get killed by blaster rifle yet you'll be ripping your hair off being unable to progress."\n\nI'll start with the cons-\n\n- The shooting mechanic isn't really optimized, the game was made around the melee lightsaber combat. But on a quake engine. So not only the first two level are a royal pain in the ♥♥♥, You might not feel comfortable blasting away in fear that you won't find more ammo of your favorite gun.\n\n- While there is a respectable amount of Force Abilities in game, you'll prefer sticking to one as changing them mid battle doesn't work. Especially late game when you're facing horde's of storm trooper, you'll just use force push and slice them while there still on the ground. Isn't fun but it's way better compared to the next con.\n\n- Pathfinding. You're reading that right.\n\nKilled every single one of Desann's grunts with wookie blaster shots bouncing off the wall? Well then make sure you have a keen eye, buttons are easy to miss as they blend well with the non interactable environment. It's not like a keen eye wouldn't catch the difference but with the quake engine, I really don't know if it is quake but it quite close. You really don't have the pace, most of the time you're running like your pants would implode if you stopped for too long so it's easy to miss those critical elements, the reason It took me 11.8 hours... yep you guessed it. Running around like a lunatic because I couldn't find that grate on the ceiling.\n\nThis is the only major flaw, the rest come out pale in front of it.\n\n\nNow the reason you should buy this game, I know I trashed it quite a bit but this is the second time I bought this game. I had gotten the hard copy a decade ago. A decade later- minus a week I bought the game again.\n\nIf a decade later from today, I lose my steam or for whatever reason I loose this game but I have the opportunity to buy this game again, I would buy it. Obviously not for 20$ or even 11.99$, (bought it cheap on sale), unless the remake the whole game on the latest game engine and tweak some stuff, then price is not a concern.\n\nwhoops! Well here are the pros\n\n- No DLC\n\n- No Micro Trasactions\n\n- Single Player, multiplayer optional\n\n- Decent storyline, kinda like those kebab's you buy off that shady guys stall. You know that it's bad quality and there are better kebab just down the street but you can't be bothered as the kebab in your hand taste just fine, also you aren't dead after eating them.\n\n- Light Saber's\n\n- You getting your Light Saber back\n\n- Mowing down them grunts with Light Saber\n\n- Throwing your Light Saber at them grunts\n\n- Grunt's with Light Saber\n\n- You fighting Grunt's with Light Saber!\n\n- Pew Pew Pew!\n\n- Aw! Those wall jumps are so sweet!\n\n- Mind Control the officer and make him do a dance off with the other officer (Warning, a figment of authors imagination not in game)\n\n=======\n\nYeah, I'm gonna take a break now that I've finished the game. In case you do buy the game remember these 2 commandments\n\n1. Thou shalt rebind the quick save and quick load key for taking a screenshot with every save is not for the sane.\n\n2. Thou shalt quick save whenever there is danger to face, for autosave is a handicap this game laughs at.\n","December 6, 2015","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So you get to slowly upgrade your force powers from "meh"  to "holy s**t he just killed a whole room of stormtroopers in one lightning blast run away" one neat part is even with your lightsaber you still get to use some of your laser guns often (mostly in sniper duels with those cowardly rodians but still) and the lightsaber fights are pretty badass so go and exercise the peaceful religion of the jedi by killing and/or mind controling almost everyone you come across. If nothing else its worth buying just so you can slice off a dark jedis arm at the shoulder and say "well i guess you were *puts on sunglasses* Disarmed!"","January 27, 2014","true","38.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was the demo version from the E3 show this was revealed at.  I enjoyed everything about the lightsaber powers, the shooting, the music, everything about this game is Star Wars.  It takes more from the prequel trilogy in terms of its lightsaber combat with Kyle doing flips, and the action being much faster.  Thats not a bad thing at all. I bought the Gamecube version which was terrible and blurry and my biggest regret but the problem was my PC was a family PC and there was not enough HD space left for the game.  About a   year ago, I found out this game and the previous Dark Forces games were on steam as a bundle and it was an instant buy for me.\n\nThe story takes place after RotJ where Kyle must learn to become a Jedi Knight again after his partner Jane was "killed" by a dark Jedi namned Kasan.   So many different worlds to explore like Nar Shadda, Bespin, the valley of the jedi, a massive star destroyer.  It all feels like a Star Wars game set in the Star Wars universe.

It has the same fun combat (with a lightsaber, many other Star Wars weapons, and Force powers) that made Jedi Knight such a good game, and it this time it has 21st century graphics, legitimately good voice acting, and a stronger story. It's in the period when Luke's Jedi were headquartered on Yavin 4, and it pits Kyle Katarn against a really great set of new villains while sending him to a lot of iconic Star Wars locations. Unfortunately, the platforming which has been my bane throughout the series is still here. If you love platforming, that will be a plus, but for me, it's the one thing I don't like about this game. (Of course, you can save at any time, so at least it's manageable).\nI'd say this is the third-best Star Wars shooter ever made (right after Battlefront II and Republic Commando). If you are a Star Wars fan (especially an Expanded Universe lover like me), and/or enjoyed previous games in the Dark Forces/ Jedi Knight series, I recommend this game. If you're interested in the Jedi Knight games but don't want to play something with extremely dated graphics, then this is my recommended jumping-in point.","January 21, 2015","true","43.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is inbetween.  Jedi Outcast is one of those games that will rub you wrong for long periods of time, and be very fun for the rest of the time.  First off, I am good at FPS games and this is a half and half on 1st and 3rd person.  As you will be using both guns and your lightsaber.  I played this game the first time on the 2nd difficulty and I found that it was pretty easy to kill enemies with 2-3 hits from the blaster, its a bit annoying that projectiles are slow and you must time it right but you get used to it.  What I cant get used to is the overpowerment of enemies.  There weapons do way to much damage, even utilizing your force powers like speed they still do lots of damage to you and not in the good way.  Also the lightsaber fighting mechanics are not that great.  Kyle acts like the lightsabor is as heavy as a claymore when its supposed to be a very lite weapon, so hes basically swinging it around uncontrollably and slow.  And enemy lightsabors do more damage to you than yours does to them.  Dont try to tell me otherwise I looked in the games files and thats how it actually is.  So I found fighting enemy jedi a pain in the ♥♥♥.  However I will say that this game is saved by its lengthy time to finish (19hrs for me on blind run), and the fact that most of your force powers are very good.  Although I dont like how you must use them or else they wont level up, and I know thats how most games work but its not done very well here.  The game also exceeds in being a good fps espiacially for the time.  Your weapons do very good damage most enemies taking only about 4 hits to die.\n\n\nSo is it a good fps game?   ♥♥♥♥ NO, its decent but I know it could have been balanced a bit better.\nSo is it a good Lightsaber game?  ALSO ♥♥♥♥ NO, Im sorry but the fighting mechanics for the lightsaber (only against enemy jedi) was just to challenging.\nSo is it a good star wars game?  Yes it is, its one of the best out there and I recommend any fan to play this game, its well worth a playthrough.  I just wish they did not overpower enemy damage to you.  Dont get me wrong I like it when enemy weapons do a good amount of damage, but this game fails at it.","May 2, 2014","true","44.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This was my first Star Wars game and it's still awesome, though that might just be nostalgia (played 1 playthrough).\n\nI have to say its fun to see how things changed over the years, no waypoints on where to go, sometimes I just had to search and go over places several times, only to see that I missed an airvent to go through. It might seem tedious, but it gives more immersion as it makes you feel like Kyle when he was finding a way to move through the areas, so for me that is a plus, alhough also an annoyance at times :P","March 5, 2015","true","27.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Me and a buddy bought this game back in 02'. I had never played any other Jedi knight title prior to Jedi Outcast and as a Star Wars fan I had high expectations. The game did not disappoint, it was, and still is, a fantastic experience. Not only is it a excellent Star Wars narrative but the gameplay is superb too. I loved trying to take out a reborn using the wookie crossbow in 1st person then instantly switching to 3rd person to finish the job with a forcepull and a heavy swing of my lightsaber. As someone who has been a serious pc gamer for over 20 years I hope you'll take my word that this game is worth every penny.","January 9, 2015","true","22.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have never played this game before I bought it on Steam last week (May the 4th sales FTW!) and I can honestly say that even without nostalgia glasses this game is pretty great.\n\nIf you're looking for a Star Wars game that lets you experience the power of a Jedi, and KotoR's turn based gameplay while good, didn't give you the experience you were after - look no further. Both Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy are some of the best Jedi games I've ever played.\n\nAlso, did I mention there was dismemberment? Holy ♥♥♥♥ there is. You can chop off hands, arms, heads, legs and bisect them horizontally at the waist, all at once!

This make sense since he became a Jedi because he had to, not because he wanted to.\n\nThe game focuses a lot on action and follows a very well made story line. Force Powers and Lightsabers are now mandatory features and both are executed very well. Lazer blasters work much better, sound effects are great and the variation in level design is just awesome.\n\nThe Jedi Knight series is not the best game series in the whole world, and the bad guy "Desann" is really, really forgettable. It is however a very good action shooter and you do feel like a jedi. It is the last entry of Kyle Katarn as a main guy in this series and it is a very good game.\n\nPostive\n+ Action\n+ Graphics\n+ Level Design\n+ Story\n+ Force Powers / Lightsaber\n\nNegative\n- Bad guy (Desann)","May 17, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have fantastic control over the lightsaber, and combined with the excellent selection of force powers and fantastic gun-play, the combat as a whole is extremely satisfying. The story is adequate at best, and the platforming can be a little tricky, but these are the only negatives I can see.

Do i really want to play this game sense it really makes you think.... yes... yes you do this game does not only have an awesome story but also a big community in guides and some awesome CC that you can use to make the game easier right from the begenning and soooo much more fun... specially the CC for mutilation... I always wanted to slice some storm troopers in 10 peices... or litearly in half lol... oops one ran their neck right into my light saber... head falls off... Luke accidentally jump on my light saber head first... had to start mission over lololol... oooh nooo storm trooper incoming.... passes right through my light saber im guessin he wont be needing those two arms... or legs... lololol.\n\nAnyways great game, buy both JA and JO, play it JA first then JO. Both Game go for 10$ trust me money well spent, dont trust those people who say wait for it to go in sale... JA you will play over and over and over again... Been playing them sense they came out in XBOX lol.\n\nGame Play 9: I hate using guns in a Jedi game... Theirs a way around it to use a saber from the begenning (google) ;P\nPuzzles: 10: frustrating but rewarding\nSound 10: pew pew pew, pshhhhh slicing....\nStory 10: me against the whole Empire.........

The only thing I would say would be that the combat isn't that great, and sometimes enemies don't respond well to the hits they take. Also I would say the inventory is too hard to use, and medpacks don't appear frequently enough as you lose health at a very fast rate.

Of course, there weren't YouTube tutorials/let's plays back then, so you either had to buy a Prima guide or figure it out yourself. Though gamewinners usually had walkthoughs, you had to read through it - no pictures, just words. That got very confusing though, especially when they were around 50 pages per walkthrough, sometimes over 100 pages even.\n\nThe game is played in the first person perspective, though you can switch between third person as desired. You begin out only with a stun baton and a handgun, and you often find new weaponry, including a Lightsaber and Force powers. Each weapon has a secondary fire mode, for example: the handgun has a charge shot, the blaster rifle has a full-auto fire, etc. Each Force power gets upgrades by level progression. You also learn new stances with your Lightsaber, which have different perks - such as faster swings or more powerful swings. By default, your Lightsaber is blue, and the only way to change it is through a cheat. Here's the cheat: hold SHIFT and press ~ then type "helpusobi 1" (exactly as I typed, just remove the quotation marks) to activate cheats, then type "sabercolor x" - replace the x with either red, yellow, purple, or green.\n\nThe story is pretty amazing. Jedi Outcast takes place shortly after the events of Return of the Jedi. You play as Kyle Katarn, a Rebel mercenary who teaches himself the ways of the Force. Throughout your journey, you encounter a few Jedis, including Luke Skywalker and Desann, a Dark Jedi who is the primary antagonist of the game. You also encounter Lando and must break him out of his imprisonment and assist him with finding his ship and escaping.\n\nI'm playing the game on my laptop running Windows 8.1, and I can confirm that it works perfectly with said software. I also got it to run on Windows 10, but I've heard Jedi Outcast, along with a lot of other old games, don't work too well if at all on 10, so be advised.","January 17","true","37.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So what makes it great? Thats kinda simple:\n+Star Wars-like, convincing dialouges which are quite hilarious sometimes\n+Balanced Force Powers make you feel like a real Jedi, not like an overpowered demigod (i.e Force Unleashed). The Force is strong in this one though.\n+Interesting, though not very logical level design in terms of realism at least\n+Its not just a shooter but also includes some riddles/puzzles (if thats not your thing, check the net for solutions)\n+Funny, sometimes a bit ridicoulous ragdolls which may cheer you up immensely\n+Steer an ATST (ok, its just a short level, but hey, reduce difficulty to zero for one level relaxes the game nicely)\n+9/10 People who have given this game a bad review are not blaming the gameplay, but the compatibility issues with win7/mac (I had none so far with win7 and perhaps one should not buy a mac and then complain that games are incompatible)\n+Still a better love story than Twilight\n+Features mods and some nice MP-modes (like Jedi Master, Holocron, etc)\n\nWARNING: This game may be inconvenient for you if you are unaccustomed to what I call the "old-school"-Shooters, that said you have no regenerating health or objective markers that take you by the hand.\n\nWhats bad about it:\nHm, well I guess lightsaber duels are not as good as they could be since its mostly fumbling around waiting for you or the enemy to die. But against enemies without lightsabers it works pretty well.\nSome people complain about the fact that the crosshair wavers under certain circumstances like running up to a wall. In my personal opinion that is confusing but has a good reason: Since you are shooting "from the hip", holding your gun in the right hand, so the Projectile travels from slightly right of you towards your target. When you move towards a close Enemy/Wall your crosshair deviates towards the hand holding the weapon which may be unnerving but also making the game more realistic (since you dont hold the gun centered in front of you like in Doom.","May 13, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This make sense since he became a Jedi because he had to, not because he wanted to.\n\nThe game focuses a lot on action and follows a very well made story line. Force Powers and Lightsabers are now mandatory features and both are executed very well. Lazer blasters work much better, sound effects are great and the variation in level design is just awesome.\n\nThe Jedi Knight series is not the best game series in the whole world, and the bad guy "Desann" is really, really forgettable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/recommended/6030/","sharuun","No More Please","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/","205 products in account","I'm very aware that one of my most hated reviews is Star Wars: Republic Commando (as it's the only one with three comments that attempt to insult me), but I never flinch when it comes to a game that didn't do well with its gameplay and narrative. I'm sure you know where this is going (especially, since I've got a big thumbs down on my review as it).\n\nYeah, I didn't really enjoy Jedi Outcast. I mean, I like the lightsaber combat. No, I love it. It's astounding. It's fantastic. It really makes you feel like a Jedi without all the strings attached (like when the blade is made out of plastic). But I don't like everything else around the lightsaber combat and occaisionally polished level design.\n\nFor starters, the biggest complaint that I see from many other critics is the incredibly dull first five hours of the game. Yeah, I'm right there with them on that. I actually set the game aside for a couple months (while I actually beat Jedi Academy in that hiatus), just because the level design was so vague and the FPS mechanics so bland and story so thin I couldn't find any enjoyment whatsoever. Even when you get your lightsaber, Nar Shaddaa is an absolute nightmare of level design. However, for some strange reason, once you get to Bespin the level design and fun rocket off high into the sky for the next 7 hours. The story's still garbage, but the level design and fun lightsaber and Jedi-related objectives are really fun and engaging.\n\nI guess I should address my problems with the story. Well, for one, Desann is one of the most boring villains ever. The only thing you could say that's slightly interesting about him, it's that he's reptilian. And sure, the last villian you fight in Jedi Academy wasn't that great, but she functioned more as a conduit for a Bowser-esque final boss that provided an ultimate challenge. Desann had a lot of opportunities to shine, but he's just like every other bland, forgettable villain you've seen before.\n\nThe animation is also very wonky in this game. Characters move stiff and interact with each other in very robotic manners (matching their stiff mouth movements perfectly). Near the end, two characters kiss, and it looked like someone pressed them together, forcing them to make lip contact, but they actually had no attraction for each other. Besides that, the story as a whole is pretty samey. Big bad Empire tries to take over the galaxy, Rebels (or New Republic) fights back, become a Jedi, yada, yada, yada...\n\nI prefer Jedi Academy much more than Jedi Outcast, because Academy was tailored around making each level as unique as possible (probably since they knew the story was pretty much the exact same as Jedi Outcast, but with a predictable plot twist near the end), and centered each level around a mechanic or attraction that didn't take up too much time- like fighting with Chewbacca, avoiding a Rancor, or freefalling down caverns to land on small ledges. Jedi Outcast has fewer planets and fewere situations for you to adapt to to get invested more. But the biggest reason I think I'm more apt to play Jedi Academy a second time, would be because for the 10 hours I played Academy I had tons of fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeadwingDuck/recommended/6030/","DeadwingDuck","Blind Clawdian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeadwingDuck/","44 products in account","Jedi Outcast has all the fundamentals of being a good game, and it definitely shows promise in parts, but too much of the game is spent slogging through utterly terrible levels of the worst design imaginable.\n\nFirst, the pros:\n\n- The lightsaber combat is fantastic, and while it isn't as advanced as in Academy, the game's sequel, I actually had more fun with it here than at any point in Academy. Something about its simplicity feels better. It isn't as flashy, but it has more weight to it.\n- The cheat codes are brilliant. By far, the most fun I've had with the game has been spawning 30+ Reborn and engaging in enormous battles, or pitting Luke against 100 Stormtroopers, etc. It's simple, but kind of amazing.\n- The game definitely will make you feel like a Jedi doing cool stuff.\n\nNow the cons:\n\n- Godawful level design. Far too often, you'll end up wandering around wondering where the hell to go next. I loathe games that hold my hand and point me in the right direction with giant guide arrows, like I'm a little child, but this game takes it so far to the extreme that it gets infuriating. At the time of writing this, I'm on the last level of the game, where, after getting stuck for about an hour, I realized that the way forward was under dark, solid-toned water (I.E. not clear) and behind a rock wall, which, from above the water, looks exactly like the rest of the environment. Many of the solutions to the player's pathfinding woes are similarly esoteric; you'll get stuck until you notice the tiny two-foot grate on the ceiling, which looks exactly like every other grate, except this one is breakable because... video games. So much of the level design feels less like an intended path and more like you're hunting for secrets. Some people tell me that this is just how games were back in the day, but I know that isn't true. Doom wasn't like this. Neither were Quake, or Thief, or System Shock, or Deus Ex, etc. Jedi Outcast's level design is frequently just obtuse and frustrating, and not fun.\n- The random difficulty spikes out of nowhere. I like a good challenge, but a fair few parts in this game are just ridiculous and poorly designed. The second area, Artus Mine, is often even more difficult than much later parts of the game. The Nar Shaddaa Streets sniper-dodging will have you tearing hair out of your head, as they seem to have perfect reflexes, perfect aim, and about three buddies to shred your health at any given time while you hopelessly try to take aim at just one of them. In the second-to-last area of the game, you have a completely unnecessary, unfair and horribly-designed stealth gimmick forced upon you; even though, by this point in the game, you've pretty much incinerated half the Imperial army single-handedly, suddenly Kyle decides that there's one too many enemies on the map, and if any of them see you, it doesn't matter how well you're hidden or how good you are at fighting them, because the game immediately cuts to an arbitrary "you lose" cutscene with Kyle getting captured. The Jedi fights throughout the game, as well as a few bosses, can often be frustrating, purely because they have abilities you can't do anything about. At any time, they might decide to eat half your health with the Force Grab - a move which you can also do, except that every time you try using it on them, they're completely resistant to it. In Academy, at least you could make yourself resistant to their cheap Force powers as well, but not in this game.\n- Everything before unlocking the lightsaber. No, you don't start the game with the lightsaber. Instead, you have to go through a number of mind-numbingly horrendous FPS maps before you get your trusty laser sword. What's so wrong with these early levels? A few things. For one, nobody played Jedi Outcast for a tedious FPS, they played it for Jedi action, and holding it back from the player for so long is just mean. Another issue is the shooting: it's absolute garbage. Your lasers move at a snail's pace, making any moving targets a chore to hit. Remember when I said the second area was one of the hardest parts in the game? This is exactly why. You enter enormous rooms with 15+ enemies all shooting at you, all at once, and your only defense is a painfully inaccurate, weak laser rifle, and grenades, which, if you ever try using in a big fight, will probably just result in little more than you getting shot a whole lot. In one of the later parts of the level, you take an Imperial officer at gunpoint (or grenade point, or shocky stick point), and lead him on a sleep-inducing walk at about 0.5 MpH to get him to open a door, at which point he unsurprisingly attacks you and you are (once again) ambushed by about eight enemies. By that point I was half asleep! What a rude awakening.\n\nThere are other things to comment on; some positive points (Lando's appearance is great, and every level he's featured in is also a lot of fun), but mostly negative ones (the terrible platforming that gets shoved down our throats at every turn, the AT-ST bit in the last area, the fact that the online multiplayer seems to no longer work). In general I'd say this: buy this game if it's on sale. You might like it, and odds are, you'll definitely enjoy cheating and creating some cool battles and stuff. If it isn't on sale, I couldn't recommend it at $11 CDN. Instead, if you're in need of a quick Jedi fix, go play Academy instead. Or, if you're looking for an actual good Star Wars FPS, try the first two games in the series (Dark Forces 1 and 2), or maybe the old Battlefront games, even though the multiplayer is down.\n\nWhatever you do, make sure you have fun.","January 8","false","27.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is good fun to use the light saber to cut down the stormtroopers/enemies. But just just wait till you get into 1v1/1v2 jedi fights. At first you'll struggle but keep learning how to fight properly - always make sure to keep moving and the battles will feel amazing. I mean amazing - it really encaptures what a jedi fight would feel like!\n\nOne key note is the nar shadaa streets level.

Saber combat is fun, responsive, and stylish. The shooting mechanics are nicely polished as well, with a very nice array of blasters, repeaters, cannons, and others. Each is fun to use, have multiple different firing modes, The only problem? Once you get a hold of your lightsaber, you will never want to use anything else. For the most part, the game allows for it. While tons of games boast the ability to "play-how-you-want," this is one of the few that actually lives up to it. Wanna be a dirty little sniper and desintegrate Rodian thugs? Go for it. Wanna use the force to cast countless poor stormtroopers into perfectly-placed death-pits? Ain't nobody stopping you. Wanna just hack every single thing with two legs like it's a really messed-up version of fruit ninja? May the force be with you, you crazy fierfek.\n\nPros:\n-Fun, responsive gameplay.\n-Best lightsaber combat in the industry.\n-Monstrous amounts of weapons, force powers, and items to collect and utilize.\n-Surprisingly responsive AI (enemies will surrender, panic, feign retreat).\n-Length single-player campaign.\n-Excellent story set in the (sadly no-longer canon) expanded universe.\n-Absolutely brilliant multiplayer (which is still somewhat active, but you can always just go it against bots).\n-Cheats galore.\n-Excellent music taken straight from the films.\n\nCons:\n-Story campaign is a slow starter, some patience is needed.\n-The Steam version has a few bugs and issues.\n-Graphics are servicable, but somewhat lacking by today's standards.\n-Some levels early on are truly difficult, they will test both you patience and skill (remember to quick save often).\n-Multiplayer isn't super-active.\n-No longer considered canon (which is a damn shame because this one is excellent).\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough.\n\nPlay if you enjoy:\n\n-Old-fashioned shooters with an irresponsible amount of weapons and ways to massacre your enemy\n-Star Wars\n-Third (or first) Person hack-and-slash gameplay\n-Free use of force powers in every way you ever wanted\n-A lengthy, story-rich singleplayer experience\n-A very meaty challenge\n-Offline with bots\n-Fun\n\n"I'm no Jedi, just a guy with a lightsaber and a couple questions."","November 4, 2015","true","59.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm sure you know where this is going (especially, since I've got a big thumbs down on my review as it).\n\nYeah, I didn't really enjoy Jedi Outcast. I mean, I like the lightsaber combat. No, I love it. It's astounding. It's fantastic. It really makes you feel like a Jedi without all the strings attached (like when the blade is made out of plastic). But I don't like everything else around the lightsaber combat and occaisionally polished level design.\n\nFor starters, the biggest complaint that I see from many other critics is the incredibly dull first five hours of the game. Yeah, I'm right there with them on that. I actually set the game aside for a couple months (while I actually beat Jedi Academy in that hiatus), just because the level design was so vague and the FPS mechanics so bland and story so thin I couldn't find any enjoyment whatsoever. Even when you get your lightsaber, Nar Shaddaa is an absolute nightmare of level design. However, for some strange reason, once you get to Bespin the level design and fun rocket off high into the sky for the next 7 hours. The story's still garbage, but the level design and fun lightsaber and Jedi-related objectives are really fun and engaging.\n\nI guess I should address my problems with the story. Well, for one, Desann is one of the most boring villains ever. The only thing you could say that's slightly interesting about him, it's that he's reptilian. And sure, the last villian you fight in Jedi Academy wasn't that great, but she functioned more as a conduit for a Bowser-esque final boss that provided an ultimate challenge. Desann had a lot of opportunities to shine, but he's just like every other bland, forgettable villain you've seen before.\n\nThe animation is also very wonky in this game. Characters move stiff and interact with each other in very robotic manners (matching their stiff mouth movements perfectly). Near the end, two characters kiss, and it looked like someone pressed them together, forcing them to make lip contact, but they actually had no attraction for each other. Besides that, the story as a whole is pretty samey. Big bad Empire tries to take over the galaxy, Rebels (or New Republic) fights back, become a Jedi, yada, yada, yada...\n\nI prefer Jedi Academy much more than Jedi Outcast, because Academy was tailored around making each level as unique as possible (probably since they knew the story was pretty much the exact same as Jedi Outcast, but with a predictable plot twist near the end), and centered each level around a mechanic or attraction that didn't take up too much time- like fighting with Chewbacca, avoiding a Rancor, or freefalling down caverns to land on small ledges. Jedi Outcast has fewer planets and fewere situations for you to adapt to to get invested more. But the biggest reason I think I'm more apt to play Jedi Academy a second time, would be because for the 10 hours I played Academy I had tons of fun.

This is the game in which you get to hang out with Lando Calrissian on the Millennium Falcon. It's also the game where you drive an AT-ST in a jungle and then get taunted by a dark Jedi with a deep voice in a temple while the throne room theme from Return of the Jedi plays.\n\nIt's a very 'Star Wars' experience - its attempts to summon nostalgia for the movies succeed much more than in its predecessors Dark Forces and Jedi Knight, or its sequel Jedi Academy. All of those are quality games in their own right, but Jedi Outcast has Lando in it. It feels effortless.\n\nOutcast is far from perfect - its visuals and choppy lightsaber combat have aged poorly even if its blaster-blasting is still fun. Its plot, for all its Star Wars-y-ness and syruppy nostalgia, is pretty silly (a dinosaur is involved). The nineties/noughties obligatory stealth section and needless keycard hunts are a bit of a pain. But I will be god damned if Lando Calrission isn't right there sat next to you with Billy Dee Williams doing the voice and everything.\n\nA fun adventure that gets its tone just right, while the gameplay varies. Recommended easily for fans of the films (Lando cameos btw), but for people who are after a quality shooter/platformer by modern standards, it's just a blue milk run.","May 10, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jakobvfeldmann/recommended/6030/","jakobvfeldmann","Jakob von Feldmann","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jakobvfeldmann/","54 products in account","If you grew up on Star Wars, be it in the original or prequel era, it was probably your dream to somehow adventure across the galaxy as a Jedi. Before game tech allowed it, this dream was mostly reserved for pen-and-paper RPGs, books, and multimedia. When LucasArts decided to create a game about being a Jedi Knight, it was one of my personal favorite decisions they've made. The original Dark Forces took Doom's successful shooter formula and made a Star Wars adventure with the same kind of thrill. The sequel, the first in the Jedi Knight series, was the first in which a lightsaber was introduced. After one expansion for that game, they returned with Jedi Knight II - Jedi Outcast.\n\nMy childhood was practically built on this series, but this was the game that truly made me a fan for life of the entire series, as well as the whole Star Wars franchise. If you wanted to give this game a name based upon the films, this could have been called "Return of Kyle Katarn", as Kyle has left the Jedi Order to resume mercenary work for the New Republic. Half-way through the game, a certain event transpires that drives Kyle to desiring revenge: something Jedi are forbidden to aspire toward. He rejoins the Order initially to gain that revenge but eventually realizes that revenge only killed him more than what had happened.\n\nGraphically, this game still can hold up to some of the more modern games to a certain extent. Some of the engine tech was pretty advanced for the time, and it is a very immersive atmosphere. They did a wonderful job at capturing the Star Wars spirit as well as giving us interesting areas to explore and play through. The only complaint I have with this game comes from the environment design: they designed it to be less linear in an attempt to force (pun semi-intended) the player to explore their way through the game. While this was a good idea, the lack of direction often makes the player scratch their heads in defeat as they wander the same paths over and over again.\n\nThe sound design is great as well, with a fully-voiced cast of characters, original John Williams pieces, and perfect sound effects. Interesting fact for those who watch the new show, Star Wars: Rebels - the voice actress who portrays Hera Syndulla portrayed Kyle's copilot and love interest, Jan Ors. The voice actor who voices Kyle gives both a gruff and sarcastic mercenary bad-to-the-bone feel without making you feel like the character is a jerk, and the voice actors who portray classic movie characters (such as Luke) all do a good job at mimicking the sound of the original actors.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, they refined almost every element of what made the first JK game amazing, but the most obvious refinement is the lightsaber combat and powers like force jump. In the original JK game, there was one lightsaber style that you could use, and force jump was an entirely different feature from the standard jump. In this game, there are three -- light, medium, heavy -- and force jump is intertwined into standard jump. Lightsaber combat flows very well and allows you to piece together different styles to create borderline cinematic duels against other lightsaber-wielding opponents.\n\nIn general, while this is my least favorite in the JK series, that does not mean that it is a bad game. Not in the least. It is STILL one of the best games ever designed, and is worth every penny.\n\n9/10","January 16","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So what makes it great? Thats kinda simple:\n+Star Wars-like, convincing dialouges which are quite hilarious sometimes\n+Balanced Force Powers make you feel like a real Jedi, not like an overpowered demigod (i.e Force Unleashed). The Force is strong in this one though.\n+Interesting, though not very logical level design in terms of realism at least\n+Its not just a shooter but also includes some riddles/puzzles (if thats not your thing, check the net for solutions)\n+Funny, sometimes a bit ridicoulous ragdolls which may cheer you up immensely\n+Steer an ATST (ok, its just a short level, but hey, reduce difficulty to zero for one level relaxes the game nicely)\n+9/10 People who have given this game a bad review are not blaming the gameplay, but the compatibility issues with win7/mac (I had none so far with win7 and perhaps one should not buy a mac and then complain that games are incompatible)\n+Still a better love story than Twilight\n+Features mods and some nice MP-modes (like Jedi Master, Holocron, etc)\n\nWARNING: This game may be inconvenient for you if you are unaccustomed to what I call the "old-school"-Shooters, that said you have no regenerating health or objective markers that take you by the hand.\n\nWhats bad about it:\nHm, well I guess lightsaber duels are not as good as they could be since its mostly fumbling around waiting for you or the enemy to die. But against enemies without lightsabers it works pretty well.\nSome people complain about the fact that the crosshair wavers under certain circumstances like running up to a wall. In my personal opinion that is confusing but has a good reason: Since you are shooting "from the hip", holding your gun in the right hand, so the Projectile travels from slightly right of you towards your target. When you move towards a close Enemy/Wall your crosshair deviates towards the hand holding the weapon which may be unnerving but also making the game more realistic (since you dont hold the gun centered in front of you like in Doom.","May 13, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I first played it in 2002 on my step dad's computer when I was about 7, and I never got to beat the game, as the puzzles were too hard for me to figure out then. Of course, there weren't YouTube tutorials/let's plays back then, so you either had to buy a Prima guide or figure it out yourself. Though gamewinners usually had walkthoughs, you had to read through it - no pictures, just words. That got very confusing though, especially when they were around 50 pages per walkthrough, sometimes over 100 pages even.\n\nThe game is played in the first person perspective, though you can switch between third person as desired. You begin out only with a stun baton and a handgun, and you often find new weaponry, including a Lightsaber and Force powers. Each weapon has a secondary fire mode, for example: the handgun has a charge shot, the blaster rifle has a full-auto fire, etc. Each Force power gets upgrades by level progression. You also learn new stances with your Lightsaber, which have different perks - such as faster swings or more powerful swings. By default, your Lightsaber is blue, and the only way to change it is through a cheat. Here's the cheat: hold SHIFT and press ~ then type "helpusobi 1" (exactly as I typed, just remove the quotation marks) to activate cheats, then type "sabercolor x" - replace the x with either red, yellow, purple, or green.\n\nThe story is pretty amazing. Jedi Outcast takes place shortly after the events of Return of the Jedi. You play as Kyle Katarn, a Rebel mercenary who teaches himself the ways of the Force. Throughout your journey, you encounter a few Jedis, including Luke Skywalker and Desann, a Dark Jedi who is the primary antagonist of the game. You also encounter Lando and must break him out of his imprisonment and assist him with finding his ship and escaping.\n\nI'm playing the game on my laptop running Windows 8.1, and I can confirm that it works perfectly with said software. I also got it to run on Windows 10, but I've heard Jedi Outcast, along with a lot of other old games, don't work too well if at all on 10, so be advised.","January 17","true","37.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FollowTheJudasGoat/recommended/6030/","FollowTheJudasGoat","Slade the Leveller","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FollowTheJudasGoat/","146 products in account","There is a moment in Jedi Outcast where all of a sudden everything seems to fall into place. Level design, story pacing, game mechanics, sound, difficulty, scale. It's almost an audible click. Or maybe that familiar hum of a lightsaber being switched on.\n\nWhilst the earlier levels are fun in the way that you're blasting Storm Troopers and working out puzzles, they're also a little clunky. Blasters are, paradigmatically, clumsy and random, and this is no lie in this game. You'll often find your shots missing through no fault of your own, leading to awkwardly long (and extremely hard if you're playing on Knight/ Master difficulty!) fire fights that aren't at all satisfying.\n\nBut wait it out. Whilst the game survives the first few missions on it's merits, it explodes into excellence once Kyle Katarn rejuvenates his force abilites and retrieves his saber. Suddenly an entirely new set of dimensions are opened up: huge vertical jumps, manipulation of the environment from afar, the slowing of time and the ability to knock your enemies about are not only responsive mechanics, they're incredibly fun to use.\n\nAll of that pales in a comparison against the lightsaber battles though. In all honesty it is hard to recall a more enjoyable, tense and dramatic experience than entering a duel with a Reborn. One wrong move and your dead or so badly wounded that the rest of the fight is going to see your opposition on the offensive. To become adept, you have to be agile and tactful at times and understand when to use brute force at others. You'll never forget the time you take on two saber wielding assailants. That's a feeling borne of a great game.\n\nIt's the closest thing to a proper progression system that I've ever played, with Kyle regaining his powers as the narrative progresses. Your ascent from novice to warrior-god allows you to feel powerful, but also like you deserve to be there. Like you yourself have mastered the force and lightsaber combat. As a huge Star Wars fan, to me, that sensation is deeply moving.\n\nSo yes, I recommend this game. It's one the best games I've ever played, mainly because I can't think of anything (apart from it's sequel Jedi Academy- also excellent) that comes close to it's blending of character and story progression. If you're a Star Wars fan, you owe it to yourself to play through this. If you just want something to become obsessed with and master over time, then you're in for a treat to.\n\nMay the force be with you.","February 10","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It does show its age with a few things, level design is a bit patchy and frustrating, getting hit with snipers that are impossible to see until they shoot you (one hit death depending on how much shields you have/difficulty level) and there can be 3 snipers lined up to take you out in one spot, so killing one only is pointless.  That's just one example, but generally it's ok.\nThe lightsaber mechanics are a bit sloppy which I never noticed way back when, but after playing Jedi Academy, which has a weaker story, but it's combat is slightly improved and flows much better than Outcast.  If you combined the often fun Level design and lightsaber mechanics of acadamy into Jedi Outcast, I think you'd have an almost flawless game.  As it is, it's a classic with a few cracks showing.\nAs a FPS it's good, but not great, hit recognition is VERY random at times.\nAs a jedi... lightsaber.. thing.. it's good but not great, for reasons just mentioned.\nBut the story and of course Star wars univers, music etc, are all used very well and lift it up a notch.  Great to see a reasonable 'conclusion' to the story of the character, having followed him since his old days of Dark Forces.","May 14","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
