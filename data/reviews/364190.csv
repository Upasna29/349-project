Originally it caught my eye because of its pixel graphics and bright colorful appearance. This is a wonderful casual game to enjoy with friends/family locally. I was not able to test it with a live person yet but could easily see having friendly competitive battles with my nephews when they visit. Playing versus AI is just not the same as having banter with a friend as you try to beat each other. I really hope one day to see this game update to include Steam friends as the friendly taunting would make this game amazing in my opinion.","April 26","true","1.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tatsumakisen/recommended/364190/","tatsumakisen","Tatsumakisen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tatsumakisen/","3926 products in account","Firstly let me say that this game epitomises Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, in that it has the capacity to both appease and alienate players.\n\nModes:\nRace for the Idol: You and another player must circumvent an arena whilst avoiding various obstacles along the way. The first person to reach the end wins.\nPlayer versus Player: Self explanatory\nPractice: Self explanatory\n\nPositives:\n- The art work, sound effects and overall presentation are not only excellent, but they wouldn't feel out of place in any Treasure (of Gunstar Heroes, Radiant Silvergun or Ikaruga fame), Capcom or 2D Konami offering. They're really quite awesome, and really add to the quality of the overall package.\n- Excellent local co-op mode. The competitive multiplayer aspect not only includes the player either having to try and collect more coins than their rival, but also having to race to the end.\n- Fun and varied character roster.\n\nNegatives:\n- The multiplayer maps are limited in that each half of the map is symmetrical. The only variation within the multiplayer gameplay modes is the positioning of the chests (which are not necessarily the same for both players).\n- The player in second place has very little chance of regaining the advantage due to the dominating player dictating the pace throughout the match due to power-up advantages.\n- By what I've seen, the game is only local co-op as opposed to online co-op, which severely limits its potential.\n- Lack of any meaningful single player campaign.\n\nConclusion:\nTo conclude then, this game would really benefit from a dedicated single-player campaign in that it seems to be a lot more focused on the competitive multiplayer aspect, but with that being said it's a highly polished and fun game to play overall, especially with your friends.","October 1, 2015","true","1.1"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","13","16","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/losergeek/recommended/364190/","losergeek","Joshua","http://steamcommunity.com/id/losergeek/","2883 products in account","This is a tentative recommendation. Whether or not this is worth buying completely depends on whether you have someone entertaining to play with, which is true of a lot of local co-op games, but even more so with this one, because mechanically it's too simple and repetitive to enjoy playing just for the sake of the gameplay. The real pleasure comes from the trashtalk as powerups are deployed - think Mario Kart, but instead of racing gokarts you're collecting jewels in a maze using Pac-Man's controls. There is a single-player option, even though it's not listed under the game's features, but it's an exercise in frustration as the AI controlled character is able to operate flawlessly, and doesn't get thrown off by things like the control-altering confusion effect in the way a human player would. For practicing purposes, you're better off playing a co-op game solo, as it's easier to get a handle on the controls and learn what all the powerups do without the stress of the computer using powerups against you.\nThere are some games meant for co-op that can still be fun solo, like Nidhogg, but this is not one of those games. For a lot of people, this will be a turn off, especially since it's local co-op only, but it's also a lovingly crafted game with cute visuals, nice music, and responsive controls. I think it's exactly the game the developer wanted to make, and for that I have to give it the thumbs up.","October 4, 2015","true","1.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

You traverse a maze collecting diamonds as well as items that either give you an advantage or hurt your opponent.\n\nThe game has two main modes. In one mode players compete to collect the most diamonds. In the other mode the players race to collect an idol which is located at the end of the maze. I personally preferred the diamond collecting mode since the idol mode relies too heavily on the use of the items.\n\nWhile the game does have a single player mode, it serves mostly as a training exercise for the multiplayer. If you don't have another person to play the game with locally, you probably aren't going to get a lot out of the game.\n\nI had fun with ASDAD but it is not the type of game that I would play for hours at a time. It is the type of game that I would play for maybe a half hour and then come back to at a different time. While you can do quite a bit of customizing in each level, I kind of wish the game had a couple more levels.\n\nIf you have another person to play the local multiplayer with and like the concept of traversing a maze collecting items, I think you can have some fun with ASDAD: All-Stars Dungeons and Diamonds.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy from the developer.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]","October 4, 2015","true","0.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

Gets a little competitive at times when you need to cram for the last few points at the very end of a round. Good to play against friends, or the AI (if you're in my situation and don't have friends).\n\nGraphics are cute and the audio is fitting; ASDAD is a game worth picking up.","December 25, 2015","true","0.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"
