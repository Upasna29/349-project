Whoever's responsible for pricing this garbage doesn't deserve to keep their job.\nIt's a 3 hour ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and that's including getting lost in level 2 and playing on Hard. It's an xbox 360 game that keeps all its 360-related code and content (achievement icons, controller info, etc.) but wasn't allowed to release on the platform.\n\nVisuals straight out of 2001, except the flashlight casts shadows and there's some barely noticeable bump mapping. FOV is alright though.\n\nWeapon handling is awful, none of the guns are worth using, ADS helps precisely 0%, staring at the ground and mashing the use key is mandatory to avoid floor traps.\n\nMediocre voice acting.  Terrible story with a "twist" ending (hint: you get killed because of some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t) and a protagonist more worried about his daddy issues and his girlfriend than using the radio he has in his hands to communicate with the squad he's trying to catch up with.\n\nIf you have equipment newer than say, 2008, don't expect it to work. If you have a gaming laptop that has that hybrid NVIDIA and Intel GPU switcher or have only an Intel iGPU, it'll work (slowly) on that.\n\nRecording for youtube is the only reason to ever touch this garbage, and I'll even say right on steam: Pirate it instead. Not like the development company is around to get paid for making it, they're bankrupt because of this.","March 14, 2015","false","3.7"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","23","24","4","0"

Throwing hand grenades can result in grenades stuck in midair or your character throwing invisible grenades. The grenade launcher has the same problem. Ironsights are useless.\nCertain levels had areas that appear to be unfinished - one outdoor level had a snake trap hanging in midair.\nTraps get repetitive and annoying after a while.\nYou are forced to listen to your character's insipid, psychotic ramblings throughout the game.\n\nConclusion: You may as well throw your 20 dollars into the street.","May 13, 2014","false","10.6"," 30 of 44 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","30","44","2","2"

I've played some buggy games in my gaming days, but this one takes the cake. The studio that created this, aren't even around anymore. Nuff said about this one. Played it once back in Feb. Of This year, and it ran fine. The second time I tried to play, the game would crash, and got an error message saying I was missing an exe file in the game directory. What?? The  Error message gave me no notice of what the file was that was missing, and gave me no other option but to close the game(got an ok message), and to try again. Frustrated, I quit the game, and now,  I list this as Abandonware. Think twice before buying, and buy something that is Correctly made, because this "Game" is far from that. Thanks for reading.","November 2, 2014","false","0.9"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

The game is broken and as far as I know....is currently unplayable. The developer went bankrupt after they released this game and nobody is around to do any kind of patchwork on it now. But with that being said....I did play the game when it was first released. The graphics were servicable. Far from good....but not horrible either. There were a handful of weapons that you could alternate between....however the grenades only had a 1 in 100 chance of working properly. The game had a few interesting features....namely the large assortment of traps that you had to either difuse or sidestep....and the fact that you could actually collect dogtags and severed ears. I heard that by collecting them it increased your health bar....but I never saw any significant improvement in that area. At $20 the game is ridiculously overpriced and even back in the day when it ran without a hitch....the gameplay only provided a few hours of play worth no more than $5.","March 4","false","0.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"
