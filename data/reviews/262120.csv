Furthermore, after almost a year on Early Access the port of TS1 to the TS Complete engine is bad, very bad, with many balance breaking gameplay implementations mostly because some of the turrets and units are just re-skins of Cold War ones, and lotsa missing sounds, with Signal simply stating, ooops!!! Some things just won't be ported!!\n\nNow, the biggest issue for many, multiplayer will remain locked at 30fps, that's if you have a helluva great internet connection to avoid the harsh frame drops, below 30 of course, and annoying desyncs.\n\nIf you want to play TS Cold War, get it on a -75% sale, otherwise, look elsewhere, stop supporting Unethical Studios abusing the Early Access program on Steam\n\nUPDATE\nOn Feb 17, 2016, the game is finally out of Early Access, but:\n\nThe desyncs have not been completely fixed\n\nThe MP 30fps cap stays\n\nThe TS1 portion of the game still pales in comparison to the original\n\nAfter almost two years on EAP, the game was first released on Feb 28, 2014, they just couldn't get it right. I guess that when you choose to dedicate a big portion of development time to work in another project, things don't quite come out right:\nhttp://archive.is/Ldhks","January 25","false","13.0"," 109 of 129 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","109","129","4","9"

My  review is aimed at people who really care about co-op.\n\nAs a solo experience, Toy Soldiers is great.  However, If you're like me and thought about buying Toy Soldiers to play with friends, WAIT UNTIL THE MULTIPLAYER BUGS ARE FIXED.  I really can't stress that enough.  This game currently has desynchronization problems that make it unplayable for many people.  You may go several levels without the problem, but often your connection will sever and you'll both drop from the game.  As far as I can tell, retrying over and over will not "luck" your way past the bug.  Once you encounter it, its a wall you can't get past.  It's extremely frustrating and it's been an issue for months.  I realize this game is Early Access, but it deserves criticism as a standalone product if money is involved.  So consider yourself warned.\n\nToy Soldiers is a great game on Xbox Live (good enough to buy it again on the PC) and I hope to one day see it fully operational on the PC, but until this game-breaking issue is resolved, I can't recommend it as a co-op experience.\n","April 14, 2015","false","3.0"," 76 of 96 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","76","96","2","1"

A few year went by with TS: Cold War being released but for the most part I had moved on from the 100+ hours of thee original TS. Then I saw TS: complete on steam. Those nosatalgic memories flooded back seeing TS on PC! So I bought the game (and yes I knew it was Early access) and began to see some problems. First of all the game is locked to 30 FPS which isn't a big deal to me so I looked past it. But when playing I saw that the game wasn't very optimised for mouse and keyboard. The key layouts were weird to say the least but again it wasn't a big deal to me. So I complete Cold war, now I move on to my WW I toy chest...\n\nWait what... What in the hell did they do??? ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! THEY F***** UP TS 1... HOOOOOW? I mean like... Well like... AAAAHHH!!!\n\n(3 minutes of freaking out later)\n\nOk, now that I'm a litte bit more calm let me tell you what they did... They copied over the units and the engine of Cold War... Like no joke, let me give you an example... In cold war you could get a "special" ability for killing so many soldiers in a certain amout of time, those ablities could be nukes, lasers, AC 130's ect... So in TS 1 I got a "special" ability, and guess what it was... A MOTHER F***** ORBITAL LASER... IN WW I NON THE LESS... *facepalm*... And thats not it, like i said units (being turrets) changed form what was originally in TS 1... When I looked at the game it wasn't the same game I played for so many hours... It saddens me to see how little the Devs care for the game, If you're a fan of this game from the 360... Don't buy this game, you'll only be disapointed... :(","February 3","false","4.9"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","27","35","3","0"

The porting of that game to PC was done surprisingly well. The end result was a great little RTS game based on kids toys for the PC that was very fun and enjoyable.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=425501280\n\nNow, flash forward a few years, and you have this endeavor. An attempt to bring the entire Toy Soldiers universe into one game for the PC. Most of this game was never available on the PC before. In it's current form as of my writing this review, it still has some bugs and is missing some content. But based on past experiences with the previous port, and the fact that the game is around 90% complete, I can highly recommend this game. Just be aware.. it isn't 100% done yet.\n\nI dunno if it is the strategy part, the pace, or fps aspects.. but I love this game.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=420103475\nAnd the whole toy story motif makes this one of the only games I would be willing to just sit and watch someone play.

Game bugs etc\n- Multiplayer issues\n- Will not appeal to those fond of tower defence games full of numbers and fixed variables, or players who don't find the "random and whacky" nature of AI aiming and projectile physics to be enjoyable.\n\n\nIf you're a tower defense fan but tired of strict grid-and-number affairs, give Toy Soldiers a try. If you've got any interest in 20th century military history, give Toy Soldiers a try.\n\nInstead of coldly precise towers on a grid issuing 10 points of damage every 2.5 seconds to the nearest creep, Toy Soldiers has machine guns snaking lead around the heads of Russian troops, or surface-to-air missiles casting smoky trails as they home in on supersonic US Tomcat jets. A proper realtime game with physics and 3D projectiles instead of simply disguised dice rolls hitting HP sponges.\n\nAs opposed to weighing up number based tower upgrades, area-of-effects and watching hundreds of creeps marching in a static laneway Toy Soldiers brings real time chaos and player controlled action to the mix. Build your turrets and watch their various attacks interact with the environment and enemy waves without the spreadsheet-precision of regular TD games. Take control of turrets yourself and chain up combos to unleash powerful player controlled call-ins, or hop into a vacant helicopter or tank to sweep the battlefield clean of enemies yourself.\n\nOozing with charm and  great "modelling diorama" asthetics Toy Soldiers is a breakout from the tower defense mould. Containing both the grim madness of the WW1 Western Front as well as the over-the-top 1980s Cold War, Toy Soldiers is a delightful mix of historical homage and video game fun. Contains the best representation of WW1 in a game I've seen, though perhaps the original, un-tweaked Toy Soldiers game nails it better. Only time will tell if TS:C improves or degrades the WW1 content.\n\n[UPDATE - Sadly it seems that the World War 1 content is doomed to be buggy and generally inferior to the original, but such is the effect of porting an older game into a newer game engine. Still, the very well polished Cold War aspect of the game is extremely worth the purchase.]","May 30, 2014","true","38.7"," 31 of 43 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","31","43","0","0"

It's fun and has a good bit of challenge. A good unit variety to shoot at and fun turrets to upgrade and use. Yes, you can man the turrets yourself (Except in the General game mode) and shoot at the enemy.\nYou can also drive and pilot a variety of tanks, aircraft and choppers to help destroy the enemy. Vehicles run on batteries and will eventually run out unless charged up again. Don't worry about them getting blown up or the charge expiring. On most difficulties and modes they respawn and recharge after destruction so you can continue your rampage.\nThe bosses are interesting though some are VERY annoying.\nOne thing to mention is that you can play any of the four factions (Cold War US and Soviets, WW1 British and Germany) in any combinations in multiplayer.

The Game took place during World War I, Which had Great old classic music, as well as the old weapons and vehicles from that time. Every Turret has 3 Upgrades, which Obviously the First Upgrade is decent but not too good, the Second Upgrade is better and somewhat Powerful, and the Third Upgrade is the best and most powerful. If you got alot of Points, you would Earn Barrages, but I only think there was only one on the Original Toy Soldiers, which would Bomb pretty much the whole Map. You could also Place some Barb wire so its a bit difficult for enemies on foot to reach your Toybox. The game was silly, but at the same time, It wasnt too silly, Which was absolutley Perfect. You could Fly Airplanes, Drive Tanks, You could be a Sniper and snipe all of the Soldiers, you could Control the Turrets, and You could even control the Missles that you launched from Some Turrets.\n\nThe game was obviously a great success, So they made another Toy Soldiers, Toy Soldiers: Cold War. This Game was absolutley great as well, the Game was more Modern, It had more Modern Vehicles and Weapons. The Game had More Barrages, and Lots of more hecticness. But one thing that was very great about this Game, is that you can actually take part on the battle on Foot, as a Commando. The Commando can be very Destructive and very useful, and there isnt anything better than Hearing the Commando do his Insane screams as you Blow up everything in your path. The Game still had what the game was meant for, Its somewhat silly but serious gamestyle.\nThe Game also featured Survival and Minigames which is Very Interesting. You could also do Versus with a friend (Same for the Original Toy Soldiers), and you could finally Play the Campaign with your friend, which offers just lots of Fun.\n\nThen, Signal Studios had one of the best Idea's, To port the original Toy Soldiers and Toy Soldiers: Cold War onto PC into one game: Toy Soldiers: Complete. Although its in Early Acess, They are Fixing it pretty much every month and are making sure this Port isnt one of those Crappy ports you find from the Consoles. You get Both of the Toy Soldier's, Plus you get all of the DLC from their Games, Plus you get Steam Cards, and New Exclusive Content that were never on the Xbox Live Arcade's Toy Soldiers. All of that for only $9.99, Which is a VERY good deal. Both of the Toy Soldier's used to be $14.99 each, and that wasnt even Including their DLC. Although there are Quite some bugs in this game, It is Very well worth $9.99, Do not have Second thoughts about getting this Game, it is Fun, Addicting, and well worth the hours spent.\n\nI rate 10/10, Simply because I believe that Signal Studios did an Absolutley amazing Job on the Toy Soldier's Games, and with both of them Combined into one game, Just makes it even more Amazing.","July 19, 2014","true","18.5"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","20","30","0","0"

When I first bought it it didnt work correctly one of the developers was very helpful and fixed the problem. Early access :/. But if you can get into the game without problems then its just awesome. The terrain gets destroyed as missles thunder through and your defenses take a pounding its just really cool. Unfortunately the WW1 themed soldier mode isnt availible so youll have to stick to mowing down plastic russians but thats not a problem because its not on the ridiculous COD level as its set in the cold war :). If you really want to kill plastic Americans then you can play on the soviet side which is interesting and the level of detail in the maps and vehicles is amazing. As far as optimization goes this game can run on my old wreck of a pc so its pretty well optimized and looks fantastic.\n\nAll in all if you like tower defense but not the boring kind then buy this.

The fact that this has the original Toy Soldiers and all of its DLC AND the second Toy Soldier and all of ITS DLC for $10 is amazing. At the time of writing this review I have 1.6 hours clocked in and have barley worked through the first campaign of the Cold War part, this pack gives you a lot of bang for your buck.\n\nI grew up playing countless tower defense flash games and this game is by far the best in the tower defense genre I have played. The selling-point mechanic that sets this game apart from other tower defense games is that you can take control of your various towers and vehicles on the map to fight the waves of enemies head on. While controlling a tower the game will give it bonus abilities, for example an AI mortar tower will fire one round then aim and fire again; when the play controls that same tower they can now fire three mortars in quick succession or take control of one fired shell, altering its course slightly and speed dramatically. However you can play the entire game without touching a vehicle or controlling a tower and play it as any other tower defense game, the vehicles and tower control will just give you that extra edge when things get tense and enemies slip through the lines.\n\nThis game is beautifully themed and designed, all the soldiers, vehicles, towers, and environments are in the style of an old war diorama model kit. The vehicles are all wind up, the soldiers are all display figures, the towers are all little glued together models, and the maps all take place in open model terrain cases, complete with painted cardboard sky and cloud borders on maps that give you a plane.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of the game is the ability to pause it at any time and enter "Tilt-Shift mode" which brings the depth of field and focal point really close up and drops the camera to near the ground so you can take some awesome screenshots, check out my Toy Soldiers screenshots on my profile for some examples.\n\nThe maps offer a fair bit of challenge to them but you can always make it harder by playing on a harder difficultly. There are other gamemodes like Survival and with this complete pack there's even multiplayer, but I haven't tried that out yet.\n\nA final note is that the music and sound design is superb, Signal has really made a great game, I consider this my 'perfect game' for this genre.","August 9, 2015","true","6.6"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","21","37","0","0"

However, I cannot overlook or excuse the many problems this game has. Messy optimization, regular bugs and it crashes during regular gameplay for petty reasons, making the experience bitter when the game itself is pretty damn good.\n\nThe gameplay itself is solid. Nice feel, fun concept with dialogue that makes the game all the more fun and intensive when fighting down waves of enemies. However, the vehicle control could be better and it feels like a chore to go through stages again for various reasons (mostly bugs and crashing)\n\nAgain, I love the game and if you look at how much I played the game I clearly enjoy it; but when the game keeps crashing when I'm just firing a gun with a high grade computer, there's something wrong there. Multiplayer doesn't even work at all much to my chargin and while all the DLC is free, you probably won't play through most of it before getting fed up with the bugs and quitting.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why people don't buy early access games, and why I can't trust companies like this anymore. If the developers didn't screw around and actually fix the issues like they said they would, this game would be my favorite game to play on Steam, but for now it'll just sit in my library as I hope they try again to make this game right.\n\nTL;DR: don't buy this game, it's buggy as hell.

The porting of that game to PC was done surprisingly well. The end result was a great little RTS game based on kids toys for the PC that was very fun and enjoyable. It is one of the very few games I played all the way through several times.\n\nNow, flash forward a few years, and you have this endeavor. An attempt to bring the entire Toy Soldiers universe into one game for the PC. Most of this game was never available on the PC before. In it's current form as of my writing this review, it still has some bugs and is missing some content. But based on past experiences with the previous port, and the fact that the game is around 90% complete, I can highly recommend this game. Just be aware.. it isn't 100% done yet.\n\nI dunno if it is the strategy part, the pace, or fps aspects.. but I love this game. And the whole toy story motif makes this one of the only games I would be willing to just sit and watch someone play. Watching toy planes bomb toy tanks while an old desk lamp from above lights the play surface.. it's art. So five stars and two thumbs up. If you like art, wrapped in fun, hidden inside a game... you'll like this game. And if you were a child who grew up in the seventies or eighties and played with toy soldiers.. make sure you have your heart medicine with you before you start playing.. cuz your heart may just burst with joy.","March 1, 2014","true","81.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

A masterpiece is becoming the commonplace work by unnecessary decoration.I would like to play original ToySoldiers1 without a bug.\n\nI am playing Toy Soldiers and Cold War by XBLA.\nFinishing of a clearance of all the difficulty all the stages except DLC of unpurchased Cold War.\nA recommended reason is in the expectation for Toy Soldiers1 and Steam Workshop which are probably mounted from now on.\n\nThen, how is Cold War?\nAt various game sites, the thing of Cold War is said like this.\nInvigoration increased!\nThe sequel of legitimate evolution!\nProbably, it is people's comment played only for a short time.\nWe(The friend of me and me) consider like this.\nA previous work is the tower defense game which added the action element.\nCold War is the action repairman game which added the tower defense element.\nSince nobody says a fault, I need to say.\n\nOnly the main point is written previously first.\n\nToy Soldiers(360/original pc) 9/10\nA good point\n1. Suitable difficulty\n2. The stage design on which the plan was elaborated\n3. The role of arms has clarified\n4. Height of the flexibility to a victory\n5. Score composition is intelligible\n\nA bad point\n1. Loading is long.\n2. Toy Soldiers: Complete looks bad when compared\n\nToy Soldies: Complete (and Cold War for 360/pc) 6/10\nA good point\n1. It is easy to win.\n2. If it is Difficulty Casuals, it is Invigorating Play in Those without Stress.\n3. Addition of a cooperation play\n4. Addition of Mini Game\n\nA bad point\n1. Coarse\n2. Badness of Balance of Offense and Defense in which Stress Accumulates Extremely\n3. Lowness of Flexibility in Score Earnings\n4. Medal assessment system\n5. Unrestricted combo\n6. Special Support Attack of Fate Request\n7. Score composition is unclear.\n8. Introductory Scene of Each Stage Cannot be Skipped.\n\nIt writes in detail about the bad point of Cold War.\nSince it becomes long, others exclude.\n\nA bad point\n1. Coarse\nAlthough it seems that it has been somewhat improved in DLC, proper use of arms is seldom needed in Cold War main knitting.\nWhat is necessary is to use only the Anti Tank Lv3 and the Canon Lv2, since the stage design is simple.\nIf difficulty Hard and a difficulty general are removed, arms will use properly mostly and it will not enter.\n\n2. Badness of Balance of Offense and Defense in which Stress Accumulates Extremely\nIt may be that the addition of a cooperation play is a reason. By the difficulty elite and a difficulty general, there is a very difficult scene which considers considerably at a single play.\nAn enemy's offensive strength and defense power are too high.\nThe enemy who cannot destroy with one blow of the Canon Lv2 and Lv3 has very long time to remain in a stage.\nThose enemies are high fire power almost without exception. The amount of damages given to a player may be over gold and defense power which a player acquires. It becomes a game to the extent that repair is repeated mostly in the second half.\n\n3. Lowness of the capture flexibility in score acquisition\nIn Toy Soldiers1, there was a difference in the capture method for every player also in score acquisition. In Cold War, the flexibility is quite low. The reason is wavelink, overkill, and thrillride. These are the bonuses which occur when arms and a vehicle are operated by themselves.\nFirst, overkill and thrillride. If these two remove a vehicle, it will almost be the case to take out with a Anti tank and a Canon. That is, there is little necessity of using other arms.\nNext, wavelink.It is necessary to continue beating an enemy by one's hand for taking out a high score. It is the same as difficulty elite capture. Just the difficulty elite is enough as abandoning the auto pilot of arms.\n\n4. Medal assessment system\nThe medal evaluation by an attack, defense, and a profit is too severe. It is especially a profit. Restricting the amount of money which can be used leads to restricting the number of installation and the number of times of repair of arms. In this game that is busy with repair in very many cases, I can think a quite unreasonable valuation basis.\nYou should remove the profit for evaluation, if you would like to use an invigorating game. Only the difficulty casuals in which a light gamer plays.\n\n5. Unrestricted combo\nThe cause of making the player engaged in monotonous work. A remarkable combo can be earned by operating one arms all the time on most stages. However, I cannot think that it is connected with pleasure. It is mechanical work and is monotonous.\nThe timing which stops a combo is considered. And it prepares for the next wave. ToySoldiers1 they were required for is more pleasant.\n\n6. Special Support Attack of Fate Request\nToy soldiers1 might be influenced by fate. However, as for Cold War, the element of its luck became strong beyond comparison. It is a special support attack.\nAs for a use, any special support is offered. However, the things with a strong instantaneous effect are Ramboo and a nuclear fusion cartridge. Probably, there are many people who expect that these two will come out. But it is completely random what comes out. Even an appearance of an enemy with special support with a star is random.\nThis is bad in a game with a strong score acquisition element.\nCorrective strategy is two kinds.\nBy a stage, the kind of special support attack is extracted to some extent, and it fixes.\nOr a special support attack needed is gained with the number of points like Gradius of STG.\n\n7. Score composition is unclear.\nThe contents of the result are unclear. I want it to clarify what point to have been taken by wavelink, a turbocharger, overkill, etc.\n\n8. Introductory Scene of Each Stage Cannot be Skipped.\nCamera work at the time of a game start. Mini game.\nIt is disgusted that coercion is exerted.\n\n\nThe main requests to new work\n1. Exclusion of Wavelink\nThe cause which makes Cold War monotonous.\n\n2. Reexamination of arms and a stage design\nThe stage design of DLC had improved. Unless a stage design is good, the division of roles of arms does not have a meaning, either.\n\n3.Mitigation of a fate element\nIf a fate element is strong, I do not want to do score acquisition.\n\nI love Toy Soldiers.\nIn new work, it wishes to return to the starting point.","April 9, 2014","true","62.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I personally love this game and I recomend it to anyone and everyone who loves strategy and redicuous ammounts and fun and unique gameplay! As you place down turrets, you can even control the turrets, and controling them gives special bonuses, such as increased clip size (Shoot 5 rounds from a normally 1 round clip), increased damage, target prioritizing, and even more!

The exclusion or better yet elimanition of GFWL in this game makes it playable in offline mode which is a plus. I should've known this was coming out before I bought the first one, could've saved money....but TS: Cold War is only on PC through this game. I can't wait for them to include TS 1. There is a lot of bugs and the game does crash ocasionally, but this is in Early Access so what do you expect? This a defenite buy here."\n\nNo, it's not a defenite buy. Take a look at my new review for this game:\n\nToy Soldiers Complete....what can I say about it. Well I can say  it's only half of a good game.  Cold War is awesome, it has explosions, easy to learn mechanics, and overall good gameplay (and the DLC is free!).  There are a few issues in Cold War but are not very noticeable. TS1 in this game....sucks.  There are so many problems with TS1 in this game.  I own the original Toy Soldiers, so when I bought TS:C I expected TS1 to be an exact port, but I was wrong.  SO MANY GLITCHES can be found in TS1 in this game, and even after a new update comes out some glitches still remain unfixed (and continuously remain unfixed even after constant updates).  Signal Studios tried to combine what they did in Cold War in their "remastered" version of TS1,  by adding Turbo Charge, Barrages, and other things, but these additions only reduced the quality of the game.  The barrages in the TS:C version of TS1 are just the Cold War barrages but polished to look different, and I'm pretty sure World War I nor Toy Soldiers 1 had an orbital laser, it's just madness!   Signal Studios should've just stuck to their guns, but they just had to add something new.  I get that Signal Studios wanted to balance the games so in VS. mode one team couldn't have a higher advantage over the other, but what they did here was just terrible. Here is a list of 10 glitches and inaccuracies in this version of TS1 included in this game:\n\n1) Whenever the Chemical Level 3 is used, it leaves behind the gas cloud and it loops over and over.\n\n2) Whenever the Machine Gun Level 3 is used, the muzzle can be quite blinding.\n\n3) Some enemy units are overpowered and have way too much health.\n\n4) The Anti-Air guns have this annoying gravity bullet velocity that forces you to shoot higher and due to this renders the Anti-Air gun's AI to be completely useless.\n\n5) The Anti-Tank guns are just the models of the Level 3 Anti-Infantry guns taken from the original TS1.\n\n6) TS1 bosses have a bit too little health.\n\n7) The Machine Gun models are also taken from TS1, which is ok, but the models are from the wrong parts of the game.\n\n8) The Sniper Tower is really just a Machine Gun Level 2 but modified.\n\n9) The Mortars have the same effects from Cold War.\n\n10) The sounds for the Chemicals Levels 1 and 2 are swapped.\n\nThere's plenty more glitches and inaccuracies in this version of TS1.  If you want Cold War on PC,  go ahead, buy this acursed thing. If you don't have TS1 and instead buy this game thinking it has the original TS1, you'll be very disappointed.  The only thing that's worth buying in this game is Cold War, but that's about it. This game is only half good and half completed. Cold War is ok; but TS1 in this game sucks. If I were you, I wouldn't buy it. Instead I'd wait for Toy Soldiers: War Chest to come out and then buy the original, 100% authentic, no doubt about it, not sheet TS1 on PC. The original TS1 does have Windows Live Arcade and it forces you to play online, but just deal with it, be glad it has SteamWorks at least.\n\nThank goodness Ubisoft is making the next Toy Soldiers, because I think they will do a whole lot better job than Signal Studios ever did with this damn game.  I know this game is still in Early Access, but this is just lousy.\n\n4.8/10","May 7, 2014","false","26.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Keep that in mind for the review, but if it's any consolation, I've also played both on Xbox 360.\n\nToy Soldiers is a tower defense game where the player can control turrets to take more control (or use special turret functions), use vehicles or call powers down upon the enemy. This is the all-inclusive Toy Soldiers package; both games and all of the DLC are included. Toy Soldiers is World War I themed while Cold War is 80's action movie interpretations of the cold war.\n\nThe game is easy to jump in to. The only thing to keep in mind is that turrets sometimes change a lot when upgrading. For example: level 2 anti-tank turrets lose their shell cams, which is useful for targeting long distance enemies. The rest is simple: defend your toy box (base) from enemies.\n\nThere's a campaign mode and two mini campaigns (previously DLC) along with versus, survival and minigames. The game also supports coop, but I haven't tried it on PC yet. Toy Soldiers has plenty to offer at the moment, as it's well polished, funny and most of all: fun. In it's current state it's well worth $10, but once it make it out of early access (and includes the original Toy Soldiers) it'll be a steal.\n","April 17, 2014","true","30.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Minus 1 mission (More on that later).\n\nToy Soliders Complete is the original Toy Soldiers tower defense game along with its 2 expansions and the Cold War stand-alone with it's two expansions.\n\nTower Defense, eh?\nThe basic game loop:\n- You can place turrets in specific locations. Certain turrets (like ani-air and artillery) require larger spaces. Upgrade turrets and fend off the invading forces.\n## The main difference here is that you can both directly control any turret giving you more accuracy and better kill counts, as well as using various level-specific vehicles which run on batteries.\n\nPros:\n- Great aesthetic. Love the fact that all the levels are like in a kids room.\n- Level design is generally good. Sometimes i was able to place down turrets and then sit back for a round or two and let them go to down on stuff. Other times, there were bosses that would instant kill my turrets. But overall, I feel it was well done.\n-Lots of levels.\n- Survival and vs modes (didnt play vs),\n\nThe Bad\n- Over the course of the game, I ran into 2 hard crashes to desktop and one instance where an enemy soldier didnt move and I had to hunt him down after the level was basically over. Over the course of 15 hours this doesnt seem like a huge deal.\n- I literally cant play the last mission of the main cold war campaign because it hard crashes to desktop on the loading screen. So thats annoying. Beat everything else though with no simialr issues,\n\nOverall:\nWhile this is still in early access, it generally feels like a finished game with a few annoying bugs, Gameplay-wise I say it is worth it. I am a bit annoyed I cant play one level, but thats one in a lot, so whatever.

But also much more.\nIt is divided into the Original Game (with its DLCs), set during WW1, and TS: Cold War, set between 1950-1970. Both games don´t take history to serious (for f***s sake, TSAR TANK!), but still give you something of a feeling for the time (the original especially).\nThe graphics are just lovely, very comic like and got something of 1940 Art Deco. Sweet.\nNow for the most important thing, Gameplay.\nYou get what you payed for, a humorous tower defence... With the possibility of controlling the towers... and also some units (got that right, your side, too, can attack)... and this is awesome. Be everything from a light vehicle to a heavy tank, a fighter or bomber and even the famous John Ra.... i mean Commando.\nBoth games are fought on differently designed map, from the trenches of Verdun or Ypern to combat in the centre of Berlin, everything is possible.\n","August 9, 2015","true","13.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

My reason is its has too many bugs. I played both games on xbox which drove me to buy this but Im scared to even try coop or multiplayer because it has enough issues in single player.\n\nPros:\n-Unique, its a tower defense that doesnt feel like a tower defense half of the time.\n-Highly interactable in defenses and vehicles\n-Authentic feel and sometimes you have to remind yourself these are just toys.\n-Large ammount of content and extended content (dlcs, minigames, etc)\n-controler support\n\ncons:\n-I experiance a crash 75% of the time when finishing a mission.\n-Bosses have a habbit of getting stuck or just falling through the map. (The latter makes it invincible or impossivble to kill)\n-While there are some graphics options its not very fleshed out. There are way too few graphic options which might make gamers with nice pc frustrated and gamers using low end pcs (like me) sad that particle effects and other things cause massive visual lag (even in the main menu).\n-inablility to adjust controler sensitivity and speed\n\nconclusion:\nWhile I hope these bugs and crashes (including the ones others have) it may be some time before they are fixed. The game has the potential to be maybe even better than the xbox version. When all is fixed it will be a 5 star game and an instant classic. I recommend the game only because I have had more fun than frustration fpr 6 hours untill the tutorial boss for Cold War fell through the map 5 times too many.\n\nEdit: Didnt know my graphics card was below "required" until now.

The tower defense mechanics expected from any game of the genre are all there, with some added bonus (like being able to control your towers directly and being able to use special “units” like a helicopter or Rambo).\n\nStill waiting for the other half of the game to be added, looking forward to it! I’d recommend waiting for the original game to be added into this complete edition before purchasing however.","April 28, 2014","true","0.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Best tower defense game on the market. Comes with both Toy Soldiers games (WWI and cold war). The WWI version is incomplete with only a single campaign avaliable. The Cold War seems complete with the DLC avaliable free. The game is fun, and addicting. A great game, and a great experience.\n\nUPDATE: The multiplayer portion of the entire game seems to not be working at all. There is a severe desync issue that appears to be occurring as far as coop is concerned. This effectively prevents any and all online play. At the moment, this is just a single player game.","August 22, 2014","true","11.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

No amount of reloading or replaying the map will stop it from sinking into the map. This particular defect has been outstanding for at least a couple of months.\n\nThe AI is fairly useless, for example in Cold War series, on the map where you have helicopters flying in, the biggest suite of defects is that the Tank Destroyer AI turrets will not fire at anything that is not on your side of the map, refusing to fire at anything on the Soviet side of the map, unless you are personally controlling them. What makes it a real challenge is the fact that you are revealed to have two HQs, one on the Soviet side of the map (what should be the Soviet toybox is actually your 2nd toybox), that you can't properly defend (because surprise surprise you can't put turrets on the Soviet side to defend it). So one set of enemy tanks start on the Soviet side and then stream into your Soviet-side HQ and the rest of the vehicles/ tanks stream into the actual US HQ (toy box) on your side of the map. So because you have 2 HQs, you lose the scenario even faster. Oh yes and the 2nd Soviet Anti-Aircraft battery that you are meant to destroy is also missing.\n\nIn this particular scenario, when left to the AI, not enough cash is racked up to aid with selling battery emplacements to allow you to buy anti-aircraft (armoured Soviet helicopters) batteries (and you need at least 4, or 2 upgraded with you controlling one) to defeat the helicopters. Of course then you have virtually no funds left to sell the anti-aircraft batteries and replace them with machine-gun batteries to defend vs the final level.\n\nThe other major defect is not being able to freely scroll over the map, you are forced to select an battery emplacement and use it to bug out and select another battery to move over the battlefield. Trying to scroll or move the view to see another battery and the game simply prevents you from doing anything. You are stuck in a corner or a useless part of the map, unable to scroll or move your focus.\n\nThis game is far from Complete, more like Alpha test with a LOT of outstanding basic game handling concepts yet to be resolved.","August 25, 2014","false","4.6"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","1"

It quickly became very addictive. I bought this game as it was on sale, hoping that if I ever wanted to play it, I could stay on steam. I also saw new features involved. I bought this and discovered a nasty surprise: When I operate turrets or vehicles, I lack the ability to turn right eith my mouse. Every other function worked in the game. When outside of a turrets or vehicles I did just fine. I also discovered they removed verses mode for the classic toy soldiers. I am unable to play much in the game due to the mouse problem though. Topping that with removing instead of improving my favorite verses, I was disappointed with the game. However, as I suspect nobody else is complaining about turning issues, I shall still recommend this game. Good work Signal Studios.","June 12, 2015","true","0.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kwertyuiop/recommended/262120/","Kwertyuiop","Kwertyuiop","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kwertyuiop/","326 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDon't get me wrong: I love Toy Soldiers. It's the only tower defence game I like, and it has cool and fun mechanics, namely that you can control the towers directly if you choose. Vehicles and the like are also present in Cold War. But Toy Soldiers: Complete is terrible.\n\nYou could say it's the same game, sure, it's a collection of the 2 and DLC, but it's not. The controlls are horrendous. Honestly, aiming should be keyboard only. The mouse is awful for anything. Know when you play a game and your mouse moves faster on the X-Axis (Left and right) than it can on the Y? It's like that. Times eleven. Shell cam, one of my favorite features, allows you to move and aim your shells, rockets and missiles and speed or slow them up in mid-air. Not slow or fast motion, actually hold the shell almost still waiting for your target to come closer to where you aimed. You have to use WASD, the camera controls. Also the controls that switch fast between turrets. It initiates that when you try to use Shell cam. On the coin of turrets, some levels start you in one. When they do, and I recommend using a controller anytime for this game. The use of a controller stops all of these bugs in their tracks but the following. When you start in a turret, you have your mouse in the center of the screen, the crosshair. Know bad indie games that don't have down the knack of not showing your cursor during gameplay? That element isn't here. You get to see your mouse. To get rid of it, you have to exit then reenter your turret.\n\nDifficulty spikes absolutely insanely. The first level of Evil Empire, my favorite campaign because it gives you a break from constant US crap that goes on for a whole campaign plus one pack of DLC, you get new equipment, turrets and vehicles to use, is impossible. And when I say impossible, I don't mean it's not possible as in it's hard. It's impossible to complete. You start with an infantry fighting vehicle, IFV, you've got a rocket launcher with slow reload times and a large millimeter gun. You clearly should take out the 2 enemy turrets ahead of you. Fantastic. You have 10 thousand dollars, a lot of money for equipment. And there's a jet flying around. You can see how many enemies are there, that's the thing, remember that. It bombs you constantly, and you clearly need to build an anti-air emplacement. Fantastic. When you do that, you think the bombs stop. For 10 seconds. Then the next wave comes and soldiers go through. I swear to whatever powers that be, that control existence that their damage is multiplied by 100. I've had level 3, top teir turrets be killed with full health by 1- ONE soldier's gunfire. One shot of that gunfire. And there's still bombs. After 10 seconds, more bombs drop which instantly kill your emplacements. And there's no jets. Neither my eyesight nor the enemy counter displays jets, but you still get constantly bombed. Unstoppably bombed.\n\nThen it drops. The first level of the other DLC, you get barrages, Cold War game's power-ups for killing a lot of troops fast (Which are preceded by overkill boosts. They give you infinite ammo once you get to about 75% of a meter at the bottom left, at 100% you get a barrage) that reward you with nuclear strikes, a commando, bombing runs, et cetera. First level of USA's DLC, you get a barrage every 10 seconds. I got one 8 times  first time I tried it. Then back to normal.\n\nI hope these issues will be fixed. TS is a good game, it's fantastic and I really was happy to see it here. I was skeptical at "early access," and rightfully so. I'll play it, sure, (It being Cold War, the sequel. Original WWI TS is absent as of yet, coming soon) and like it, but don't. Don't get it yourself until it's further complete. And bring a controller just in case. When it's out, get it, by all means GET IT! It's an amazing game, the omnibus version is just mediocre. Wait for it to be out in full, no more early access. That's my advice.\n\nEDIT: Oh, I forgot to mention. The HUD is wonky with croshairs appearing off the edge, or even not on the screen at all, and your mouse is always there. It resets it's position. Chaning resolution keeps low-res HUD parts, such as the crosshair and pictures on the wave meter. 1366x768 resolution is upside down. Again, wait for it to be released in full.","March 2, 2014","false","8.2"," 23 of 55 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","23","55","0","8"

Since i saw the game on Xbox 360 i always wanted it to come to PC. Funnily enough the game did come to pc called the same as the first one Toy Soldiers this game however was not like the xbox version as it had no multiplayer and it didn't say that the multiplayer got removed fooling players into buying it (myself included).\n\nBut lets put that aside shall we (even though we got no discount on this game for buying that broken peice of ♥♥♥♥)\n\nToy Soldiers: Complete is excatly what you expected from the first game a complete game it has all the features that the game should of had including the abilty to actually go to 1080p in this version. The game is very fun and has okish controls it still feels a bit stange playing with a mouse and keyboard. The game has been revamped since the xbox version giving all the stuff the Cold war game to the first one improving the experience.\n\nThe only real issues i have with this game is the camera angles they are really shoddy and are very restrictive in terms of movements, the mouse locking to towers is also really annoying i'm not playing with a console controller this really shouldn't be necessary. The only other problem i have is that the camera locks to certain parts of the map not allowing you to look across it all i don't see why the camera is restricted like this since you can see that way if you tilt your camera anyway so why not just unlock the camera?\n\nOther than that this game is pretty solid and fun to play by yourself or with a few friends on survival or versus.\n\nI rate this game a 7/10","September 5, 2014","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game got put on the back burner.  Ok.  But, the game obviously needs work at over a year in EA.
