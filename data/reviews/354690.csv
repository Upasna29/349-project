It was originally released in 2008, so don't expect particularly fantastic graphics. Considering that, they're ok for the time. Sound effects are nothing to write home about, but they blend well enough with the game. The music? Oh good lord, the music is absolutely brilliant and I wish I could buy an OST for this game.\n\nThe story has a lot of potential, but I honestly feel like it could've been expanded upon without making the game drag on too much. I don't want to risk spoiling anything, but there's quite a few area's in the story where a little bit more love would've gone a long way. As for the puzzles, most of them can be done by simply making sure you talk to everyone, check everything and use a little logic. There was only one puzzle that gave me a few problems, so I had to look up a walkthrough to get past it.\n\nMy one, major criticism is that I managed to finish the game + prologue in 2 hours. I think that's a little short for the retail price, but if it happens to pop up on offer, I think it's well-worth grabbing! The game should run on pretty much any system from 2007 onwards, which makes it suitable for laptop gamers but I would highly recommend using an external mouse.","April 9, 2015","true","2.0"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","19","26","0","1"

The pathfinding is sometimes a little clunky, there are not a lot of characters, locations or dialog choices  (and no voices, only text). Still, for me, the game has some charm, this is the video game equivalent of a low budget adventure b-movie.  A few situations made me smile, the music is appropriate and to search for a lost city was interesting enough. The graphics are not great, but I liked the style of the characters and the ancient artifacts. This is far from the classics like Monkey Island or Fate of Atlantis, but I had some fun with it. For those who like the screenshots, I recommend it, moderately, in a sale, for less than $2.\n\n","May 15, 2015","true","6.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

So maybe there is some interesting story wich have to tell us something important, and no here too, it is very short and silly plus there are no challenge at all they could put in some pixel hunting atleast.Music is nothing special, just a random something.","April 5, 2015","false","3.6"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","15","24","0","0"

The interactions are often illogical, progress is often trial and error, pixel hunting abounds, invisible walls everywhere, as a consequence the pathing is atrocious, the UI is clunky, the sounds are nothing to write home about (and the screams clearly fake), the effects are "fade to white" and "fade to red", the graphics are flash-style vector art married to eye-bleeding  "latest 3D hardware" backgrounds (if by "latest" they mean ca. 1993 - Myst looked better than this), and the dialogues are boring. Also, it's short.\n\nTake your pick from any of these and you'll be likely better off.","July 4, 2015","false","3.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"
