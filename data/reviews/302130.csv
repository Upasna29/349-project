"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/recommended/302130/","chudah","Chudah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/","1693 products in account","I've played a lot of hidden object games, and Dorian Gray Syndrome is one of the better examples of the genre.  The story starts us with a young journalist, Sam Wilde, hot off an article detailing the disappearances of numerous "beautiful" people in the area. Heading out to meet his lady love for a date, he arrives at the rendezvous only to discover a note beckoning him to the home of the man behind the kidnappings. If if he wishes to see his beloved Anna again he is to come alone. Sam must now travel to Goldvale Manor to confront the demented and insane Oscar and rescue his love.  Ok, so the story is pretty cliché and hokey, but I have played many a game with worse premises than this.  Where Dorian Gray excels is in the gorgeously detailed artwork and locations, great atmosphere and enjoyable "adventure-lite" game play.\n\nI must reiterate how beautiful and imaginative the artwork is in this game.  Each hand-drawn area features intricate detail that in a way feels almost life-like.  Even the character models are nicely rendered and don't come off as stiff and awkward as they do in other games.  A toggleable film grain filter finishes everything off with a gritty look.  Discovering the many locations and enjoying the art is reason enough to play the game.\n\nAdventure-lite is the best way to explain the game play.  Most of the objectives and puzzles aren't too difficult to figure out, but a few may have you backtracking and running in circles for a bit.  A large number of items will find their way into your inventory, many of which may not have an obvious use or be used for quite awhile; this is something I quite enjoy in standard adventure games and don't see too often in these.\n\nOf course, there are a handful of hidden object scenes sprinkled throughout the mansion, all nicely drawn without much clutter. The items make sense for the location and time period, something so many games fail to do. There aren't too many, but the ones present are neither frustrating nor too easy, just a pleasant diversion (if you don't mind them) as you make your way through the game.\n\nUnlike similar HOG's, I spent a good 8 hours playing through the entire story, including bonus chapter.  Part of that may have been me taking time to enjoy the art and atmosphere.  Playing on Expert with no hints and minimal strategy guide usage helped extend my play time as well.  But the scope of the game itself feels much bigger than most and I feel like I really got my money's worth, especially since I'll be playing this one time and again.\n\nA few things that bothered me included puzzles that are far too easy, many of which require very little thought and are often repetitive tasks once you figure out the method.  The voice acting can be a tad melodramatic, but is admittedly better than other casual games.  And Oscar tends to show up/be heard a bit too much which often pulled me out of my "adventure gamer" mode, but this is a personal gripe and others may have no problem with it.  Other than those few complaints, the game shines.\n\nBrink of Consciousness: Dorian Gray Syndrome may not be the perfect HOG, but what it does right it does really right.  If you are a HOG aficionado, make sure to pick this one up.  As a rule, I generally don't recommend these games at anything above the $7-$8 price range, but even if you shell out the full $10, I feel you'll get your money's worth considering game length, bonus chapter and extras (soundtrack, concept art, etc.).","July 25, 2014","true","1.3"," 72 of 78 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","72","78","2","10"

During his trials he is often contacted by the antagonist: an excellently written character, who constantly balances on the brink of being comically over the top, but manages to stay threatening throughout the story– including one of the best bonus chapters (with an incredibly clever twist) in hidden object game history.\n\nAlthough most of the game is spent by running around in the mansion, the monotony is often broken by some easy puzzles and a few very good hidden object scenes. And the best thing is that most of them have an actual reason within the storyline to be there, creating a more immersive atmosphere.\n\nIf you like thrillers, Dorian Gray Syndrome is definitely a good choice for you, casual genre or not.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197995992757/recommended/302130/","76561197995992757","Derp Derp Kill Kill","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197995992757/","1433 products in account","English version\n(wersja polska niżej)\n\nThis game is the very definition of why I think Steam needs the ‘neutral’ button  between the recommend and not recommend option. In my opinion, it is so perfectly mediocre that I don’t really feel that great with recommending it while there are so many other more appealing representatives of the hidden object genre. On the other hand, this game does nearly nothing bad enough to deserve not being recommended.\n\nThe premise of the game can be liked. While the norm for the hidden object games is to take place in a fantasy or a supernatural reality, Brink of Consciousness has an ambition to be a psychological thriller with a visible inspiration in Saw or The Silence of the Lambs. However, what initially seems to be its advantage,  quickly proves to be a serious problem for me. While in fantasy games it can be at least partially explained (or at least the setting helps in suspending the disbelief), the hidden object mechanics do not mix particularly well with the thriller setting: a psychopathic murderer holds the protagonist’s sweetheart captive and what does our hero decide to do? Search for a celery, a rather tremendous number of clothespins and a set of false teeth (that for some strange reason have to be cleaned first). Furthermore, it really doesn’t help that the antagonist is perhaps one of the most uninspired and tedious villains in computer games I have played (even for the hidden object game standards of character complexity).\n\nThe graphics are where this game shines. While there surely are some hidden object games looking better, Dorian Gray Syndrome certainly has moments when it pleasant to look at. Still, I would like to make an argument here that the game’s setting limits the palette do the darker colors, mainly greys and browns, while other hidden object games are free to exercise a whole range of wild, vivid, acid trip colors, which is one of my favorite component of hidden object genre. Also, music is rather forgettable for the most of time.\n\nFinally, the mechanics. The puzzles are mostly good, with maybe a few exceptions. The map shows the area of interest, but there is no quick travel available, and the hint system seems weaker than in other games of this genre: instead of showing the direction where to go, it just tells that there is nothing to do in this particular location.\n\nIn the end, I can recommend this game to the people who are tired of the fantasy settings of most of the hidden object games. Keep in mind though that, at least to me, this game quickly got boring and completing the bonus chapter was a chore – which is not a particularly great result when it takes around 4 hours to complete the game.\n\nWersja polska\n\nTa gra jest jednym z lepszych powodów dla których uważam że Steam, poza opcją rekomendacji bądź odradzenia konkretnej gry,  potrzebuje guzika „neutralny”. Syndrom Doriana Gray’a jest idealnie przeciętny i miałbym pewne problemy z polecaniem go innym z czystym sercem, szczególnie wiedząc że na Steamie dostępnych jest wiele ciekawszych gier z tego gatunku. Z drugiej strony Brink of Consciousness nie robi nic na tyle źle, żeby zasłużyć sobie na negatywną ocenę pod moją recenzją.\n\nTo co odróżnia „Doriana” od innych gier tego gatunku to świat w którym osadzone są wydarzenia gry. Podczas gdy tłem dla większości Hidden Object’ów zazwyczaj są światy fantasy,  twórcy Brink of Consciousness wyraźnie wzorują się thrillerami takimi jak Piła czy Milczenie Owiec. W mojej opinii wychodzi to jednak odrobinę (eufemizm) nieudolnie. Jednym z powodów takiego stanu rzeczy jest fakt że psychologiczny thriller nie miesza się najlepiej z grą typu Hidden Object.  W przypadku fantastyki można jeszcze tłumaczyć konieczność odnalezienia kilkunastu różnych przedmiotów odmiennością świata przedstawionego, jednak kiedy psychopatyczny morderca więzi ukochaną głównego bohatera a ten, zamiast popędzić jej na ratunek szuka w jednej z szaf selera, kilku spinaczy do bielizny i czaszki ( a dodać należy, że z bliżej niewytłumaczalnych przyczyn nie zadowoli się tą czaszką jeżeli wcześniej nie wyszczotkuje jej zębów), można odnieść wrażenie że sterowany przez gracza bohater ma jeszcze bardziej pomieszane pod sufitem niż psychopata z którym przychodzi mu się zmierzyć. Nie pomaga też, że wspomniany już antagonista jest irytujący i nudny jak flaki z olejem – nawet jak na standardy postaci w grach hidden object.\n\nGrafika jest tu mocną stroną. Oczywiście jest sporo gier z tego gatunku które wyglądają lepiej, jednak „Dorian” zdecydowanie ma swoje momenty. Szkoda tylko że konwencja gry ogranicza kolory do ciemniejszych odcieni, brązów i szarości – jedną z tych rzeczy które absolutnie uwielbiam w hidden objectach są dzikie, szalone, kwasowo – odjechane palety barw. O muzyce nie można raczej powiedzieć nic szczególnego, przez większość czasu nie zwraca na siebie uwagi, a jeżeli już, to szybko się ją zapomina.\n\nMożna się też odrobinę przyczepić do mechaniki gry. Większość puzzli jest ok,  mapa pokazuje co jeszcze zostało do zrobienia ale nie pozwala na szybkie poruszanie się między lokacjami, a system podpowiedzi jest zdecydowanie gorszy niż w innych grach: zamiast wskazać kierunek w którym powinniśmy się udać, gra mówi zwyczajnie „w tym pokoju nie ma już nic do zrobienia”. Dzięki, nie wiedziałem.\n\nPodsumowując: polecam tylko tym którzy przekatowali już każdą możliwą pozycję studia Artifex Mundi. A nawet wtedy, może lepiej poszukać czegoś innego? Końcówka gry była dla mnie straszliwie nudna, co nie świadczy o „Syndromie Doriana Graya” najlepiej, biorąc pod uwagę, że grę można skończyć w ok. 4 godziny.","November 5, 2014","true","5.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I'd like to add that the art work is well above the ordinary expected from the HOG genre.

The crashes tend to appear towards the end of the game, and prohibit you from ever finishing it.\n\nEven worse, this company is not interested in fixing the game and offers no appropriate technical support. This is the type of shovelware that links to a generic multi-company support form[support.encore.com] that is meant to shield the game developers from dealing with the results of their cash grabs. And btw, in the odd case scenario that you ever do go through with filling out the *required personal information* (really now?) of the form, I'll make you a bet: if you eventually get an email in response and it is NOT a copy/pasted variation of "Please try uninstalling and reinstalling the game after you update your drivers", I will eat my hat and send you a framed picture.\n\nOther than that, it's another collection of some puzzles interspersed with a few HOG scenes.

Compared to some, this game focuses more on the puzzles and less on HO scenes.\n\nThe story was engagingly creepy and while not entirely original, was entertaining.  The back story was fairly formulaic but as it's fed to the player in small bits, via diary entries mostly, the somewhat predictable history of the villain did not detract from the story.  What helped this is that the game didn't bonk you in the head with information about the villain; to some extent you have to imagine the events leading up to the events of the game and to me, at least, that makes it more mysterious and creepy.  The villain manages to be both over-the-top psycho and creepy.  It's a combination that doesn't always work, but it does here.  It helps that the voice acting isn't terrible (a curse that many of these games have).\n\nMinigame puzzles were generally challenging without being obnoxious or illogical; only a couple were somewhat tedious.  There is a convenient skip button for people that are stuck (or impatient).\n\nHidden object scenes were not overly challenging but did take some thought.  Graphically, scenes weren't grainy and it wasn't hard to distinguish objects from one another.  Objects are appropriately named (no searching for a "soccer ball" that turns out to be a volleyball, etc.).\n\nAll in all, this is one of the better choices for this genre of game.","March 21, 2015","true","3.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

No. Did I like it? No. I would recommend buying this if there is a sale, I just found it lacking in things that I like in these types of games. While an overall decent experience I personally found a few aspects annoying, however nothing game breaking.\n\nBiggest thing that annoyed me, the story. It's trying very hard to be scary and a psychological mind game but in the end I just got bored of Oscar's yapping and was barely invested in saving Anna. The game lacked a lot of inner monologue from Sam, the main character. You spend a majority of the game just listening to the antagonist Oscar, Sam just breathes heavy and growls. In the end I knew nothing much about Sam or Anna and I didn't quite care what happened to them, I just wanted Oscar to shut up.\n\nThe second big thing that I didn't like was the lack of hidden item scenes. The game seems to be mostly made up of mini game puzzles. Which is fine if that is your thing, however I found a lot of them tedious and was hankering for more of the lovely artwork found in the hidden item scenes. What hidden item scenes were present in the game were very fun and I enjoyed the challenge.\n\nThose two things aside, it's a solid game. But an engaging story and bountiful hidden item scenes are the main things I enjoy about this genre and this game didn't quite deliver there, in my opinion. The game also has no achievements or trading cards so if you're a collector it won't help you there.

Your own character makes noises when he's fearing something or when he's asking himself what to do or coughing, reflecting the bad weather in the game. What I truly enjoyed is an option to put more "grains" in your screens: you're really plunging into another atmospher with them. Voice acting is correct and the music is fitting to the story.  My only problem is that I can't use the map for travelling, I've to go back and forth between rooms. And the map is also showing more than any other HOG game, which can be a good thing. The graphics and drawings are also quite good. I had to skip only one minigame (the train one) because I felt it wasn't really an easy one that I would have solved (I rarely use the guide anyway).

Dorian Gray gives us an entertaining villain, always a few steps ahead of our plucky hero and gloating at us with voluble, literate glee.  Oscar, the demented masked mastermind, is unusually coherent and interesting for the genre.\n\nThe Hidden Object scenes are nicely thematic - you won't be finding hamburgers in the toolshed, for the most part - and if the whole game is on the simple side, it keeps things busy enough to fill a few hours with solid play.  The puzzles are supple, the art is terrific, and the voice acting is very very good.  I was pleased with the detail in the art and with the whole experience.  Expect 6 or 7 hours of not-zipping-through gameplay - I left the game window open while I was afk a couple of times, thus my time stat.  I enjoyed this more than the Lonely Hearts Murders sequel.","September 5, 2015","true","8.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The artwork and voice overs are very well done and it is a very spooky type vibe. So whats not to like? Well for me some of the puzzles are hit and mostly a miss. I found most of them so far to be tedious and just time wasters. The HOG are well done if a little hard to see.\n\nThe story is very well done. However you have to travel a lot between rooms and there is no fast travel although there is a map of the place. Thank goodness because this game world is huge. The guy must own 20 to 30 acres of land because the house is huge and the grounds outside of the house seem to be big as well. It does support my resolution kind of. I have 1680*1050 and it has black bars on the screen on all four corners. I dont mind it as it makes the images less blurry if they have the right resolution on them. The game does come with a guide and that is good because its a huge map and the game has no arrows that tell you what direction you should go if you click the hint button.\n\nThe game does have a hint button that will work if something can be done in the room. However it will not tell you what to use in the room and it gives no direction on where you should be going. Very annoying.\n\nThat being said I am enjoying the game even with these minor issues. The game has the same vibe as the first bioshock game. I forgot to mention you can skip the puzzles so thats a plus in my book.\n\nI just finished the entire game bonus game included. A great and fun game. I had to use the guide a lot because I was super confused about where to go. Still a very great game.","June 15, 2015","true","3.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It has a great story, the soundtrack is just as good and the voicing is done very well. The gameplay is quite simple: you collect stuff and use it to advance further.\n\nThere are three ways to aquire things needed. The first one is to simply pick them up off the ground. The stuff you have to collect may or may not be highlighted depending on which difficulty setting you choose. The second way to aquire things needed is by solving riddles (i.e. in the beginning of the game you have to tune a guitar by using a guitar tuner). The riddles get harder as player advances further. The final, third method, is my least favorite. You enter a room with a bunch of random stuff in it. You have to find 12 objects. Once you do that, they somehow turn into a completely unrelated item. In my opinion, this is not interesting, doesn't make sense and doesn't require much thinking.\n\nThere were other cons too. Most noticable one is short playtime. The game is way too short for a price this high. Then there was lack of settings. I could not adjust the resolution properly and had to play with black borders. It's impossible to adjust picture quality too, however, that shouldn't be a problem, as the system requirements are really low.\n\nIf you like point and click games and this game is on a considerable discount, you should buy it. Otherwise, you should pass. The game itself is decent, but the playtime of it is too short for the full price.","February 7","true","2.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fluoxx/recommended/302130/","Fluoxx","Fluoxx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fluoxx/","472 products in account","Initially I thought I wouldn't enjoy this game very much, but the longer I played the more I ended up liking it!\nIt has its strengths and weaknesses as any other game does, and I recommend it for the various reasons listed below.\nIn short, if you want to play a hidden object game (HOG) that offers that little bit extra, this game is worth your time and money. At it's current retail price of £6.99 you get a fair amount of game for those pennies!\n\nThe Good      I thought in terms of plot, this HOG offers more depth than a lot of others in the genre. While campy and a bit overwraught at times, it's refreshing to play a HOG with a sinister story that runs with that theme instead of offering the general comedic, almost kiddy-fied storylines. Because of the content I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to young kids - the story basically follows a guy trying to save his missus from a serial killer and features quite a few embalmed corpses that might freak some people out!\nI find a lot of HOGs scrimp on the scenery and details, but every single screen in this game is beautifully detailed and is a real pleasure to look at. However, this does have its downsides, which I will expand on below.\nThe hidden object scenes weren't too frequent and are all arranged well, there's no maddeningly obscured, tiny items to break your eyes looking for but they don't feel too much of a breeze, either.\nI play so many (probably too many haha) HOGs, and I was surprised that quite a lot of the puzzles in this game, I hadn't seen in others. A problem I have with HOGs is that often the puzzles feel recycled, but this one had some pretty fresh puzzles. Some of them were a bit er, maddening though (more on that below!).\nThe voice acting wasn't bad, it fit the mood. The antagonist taunts you throughout the game from speakers wired up around the environment and it works very well to set the tone and mood which isn't something that you experience often in HOGs.\nI racked up around 4-5 hours on this game (without starting the bonus chapter) and it didn't feel like that at all because as I mentioned above, the game is visually so nice and HOG scenes don't crop up 20 screens behind you, they, along with the puzzles, are slotted in at decent intervals. And there are  a lot of puzzles :P\nThere's a very detailed map included which is very handy considering how big the environment is. The map will tell you were locked doors are, puzzles yet to be completed once found, points of interest etc. All the good stuff ;)\nBetter yet, if you're really stuck, there's also a strategy guide you can access in the game which while some people may find cheesy I think it shows the developers want people to enjoy their game, not get frustrated and stop playing when they encounter difficulty.\nThe Bad     While every screen is immaculately presented, I felt that at times the game had more style than substance. For example, in some rooms there is literally one or two items to pick up then you're done in that room. To me that just feels like a waste when you've created such a pretty game.\nAs above, because a lot of the rooms don't contain a great deal of interactive points, the developers seem to have just added TONS of rooms in to the game. To prolong the play time? I'm not sure, but I was disappointed that a fast travel option wasn't included in the map purely because you have to do a lot of backtracking and there are so many rooms....so many ;_;\nIn terms of the puzzles, I thought a lot of them felt quite fresh but at the same time some of them made me just exit the game and leave it alone for a while. A couple just made no sense to me whatsoever - maybe I was tired, maybe it will make more sense to other people, but I had to skip a few puzzles purely because I couldn't get my head round them!\nThere are some interactive points that just don't stand out at all, so a couple of times I had to do the 'move the mouse over all the things' game which can get a bit annoying. Also, while a map is a great feature in any HOG, the one in this game didn't always update, so I'd have to backtrack through every room only to get frustrated and look at the strategy guide to find that a tiny interactive point was a ton of screens back and not indicated on the map.\nYou find little notes throughout the game written by the antagonist which portray a rather awful childhood and lead you to the assumption that this monster was created, not born. I really wish the developers had expanded on this in the main game because it was quite an interesting addition.\nOverall, I think that while the negatives offset what is genuinely quite an original HOG in more ways than one, the positives overwhelm them. I wish that there had either been less rooms/areas or more substance in the plethora of areas in the game, I think that's the major thing that lets this game down. However, as frustrating as it can occasionally be, Brink of Consciousness: DGS is a good game and even if you just don't understand some of the puzzles like me, the scenery in the game is lovely to look at and the creepy theme to the game just adds points in its favour.\nWhether you buy it at full price or wait for a sale, this HOG is a great addition to the genre and is definitely one to play :)\nThanks for reading!","October 19, 2015","true","5.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The story starts as you arrive at the mansion of the serial murderer you were investigating who has responded by abducting your girlfriend. You then have to navigate your way through the mansion, which has been set up with traps and puzzles to give you a chance to save her.\n\nThe HOG scenes here are fine and I didn't have any problems, there is a reasonable challenge here, and the graphics are fine and don't get in the way. The point and click sections between also flow very well, nothing too illogical and the scenario of the madman in his own mansion means a lot of scope for puzzles and needing to scavenge and jury rig solutions to progress without it seeming odd or out of place, which helps keep immersion in the story.\n\nOne weakness here is the puzzles - not all of them - but some are not really puzzles as such, they are completely trivial solutions that are just time consuming to do all the moves, for example the rainbow puzzle which looked like it would be an extended "Towers of Hanoi" style puzzle, but just ends up being a trivial solution just a lot of shuffling all the pegs left and right repeatedly.\n\nBut apart from that one issue with some of the puzzles, otherwise this is one of the best HOGs available, so highly recommended.","August 31, 2015","true","4.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are some HO stages, but mostly this game revolves around the mini games and collecting objects to complete puzzle locks.\n\nIf you're a dedicated object-finder, then you could probably find a more choiceworthy title out there for your tastes.

The Protagonist of the named story "The picture of Dorian Gray", has a portrait of himself that ages and takes the signs of his sins instead of him. Keeping Dorian Gray, vibrant, youthful and healthy, while the portrait ages, withers and disfigures... During the novell Dorian gray grows more and more restless and amoral, even at times sadistic.\n\nThis said, the story of the game has some similarities. I won't spoil you the fun to find out which that might be, the game as a HOG (Hidden Object Game) is quite pleasing to play, I encountered no bugs and nothing that made the playthrough a bad experience. It also has some creepy aspects, that make the game a nice one. But one warning, even though there is so much misery and bad stuff in the news, day to day, week after week, we all should take the critique of Oscar Wilde to heart a bit, and think about our own decadence, moralty and hedonism... it's already the same issue, that was reason for... well you get the picture, don't you?\n\nPro:\n- Nice graphics, and very good HOG scenes, which are still challenging.\n- Good Soundtrack of the game.\n- A storyline which holds a lot of suspense in it, yeah this game also has some fishy moments - but they actually are bearable.\n- Nice additional content (Especially the bonus chapter will give you a very rude awakening)...\n\nCon:\n- Don't expect replayability. Once you are done, you are done with the story too... due to the linear gameplay of most HOGs they are a lot like illustrated interactive novells... Not that bad, but you have to look if you like this as a fact... Like most HOGs this one is only slightly challenging.\n\nRecommended\nIf you are new to this kind of game, this game might be the perfect first try. Since it has no achievements it won't grief you with missing out stuff and have to go through the same story once again. Also the story isn't boring, though roaming through all those HOG-Scenes might get on your nerves, once you are done you'll appreciate the work that was invested in this little jewel. But keep in mind, this game is expensive, either try to get vouchers, bundle or buy it when it's cheap on sale. At 9,99 it's still worth it's money since this HOG actually is fun to play and gives you a little respite with girls being the protagonist of a lot of HOGs...","July 24, 2015","true","7.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I also didn't feel like skipping the hidden objects scenes, which means they were also decent at least (I'm more for the point-and-click part of these games, not hidden objects).\nIf you like hog then you'll most likely won't be dissapointed in this one.","October 29, 2015","true","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It should eventually be considered a classic. Way better than we HOGers are used to.\n\nSuperior voice acting by the villain. His voice over basically drives the story and puts the game atmospher on a level most horror games can only dream of.\n\nVery good puzzles. Only one I could not figure out and the vilain, asked me if I cheated when I skipped it. And there was one tedius puzzle if just didn't want to go all the way through with once I figured it out. Most of the rest of the puzzels were actually pretty fun to play and figure out.\n\nThe bonus chapter was thankfuly short. But very good and it must absolutley be played.

Sounds familar and it all plays out through the killers house of horrors. In the house you will solve puzzles, HOG and look for objects that will help you gain access to other objects or areas. Again, pretty normal but for this particular game my intrest was in the killer who almost is doing his best Joker impersonation, without being the joker. Inside the house of Oscar, the serial killer, he sees himself as an artist who has kidnapped young people and then embalmed them in these large tubes as show pieces around the house. Its sort of eerie but his explanation turns towards their betrayl of his trust and love. Sort of interesting, but cliche but the voice work and writing are not bad and while i was hoping for a better conclusion its always more about the journey than the end.\nThe puzzles and hidden objects are hit and miss and i found myself skipping a few(for the first time ever) as there are some that the trial and error becomes time consuming and sort of frustrating. There are also a few objects in scenes which are almost invisible and some of the multi tear hidden objects puzzles are not clearly defined. Luckily, a hint system, skip puzzle and the complete walkthru are all attached to the toolbar for easy access.\nBrink of Consciousness is just OK as it doesnt stray away from the HOG blueprint and for fans of the genre thats fine.\n\nPositives\n\nGood writing and voice acting for the serial killer\nThe scenes are all manageable and look clear\nNot origianl but still fun and relaxing\nGood musical score\nGuide and hints attached to the toolobar\n\nNegatives\n\nVery safe and predictable\nPuzzles are inconsitent\nSome multi tear hidden objects not well defined\n","June 26, 2015","true","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However there is a very dark untertone to the game (basicaly you are chasing a serial killer around his house trying to rescue your Anne.

Unike almost every other HOG in existence, the voice acting is excellent and the story very good.  The HOGs, puzzles, graphics, and gameplay, in general, are also all very good.  The only issue I've got with the game, itself, is that it needs a framerate limiter.  While I was playing it, my framerate ranged from 800 fps up to almost 4,000 fps.  It's possible, though, that that was because I played the game in a Crossover emulation bottle under Linux.  I do have two thematic problems with the game.  First, the game involves a trail of bodies from a psychopathic mass murderer.  So, it's not exactly goodness and light.  Similarly, the ending leaves me a bit ambivalent.  Things are tied up (especially after the bonus chapter).  But again, not goodness and light.\n\nI got a total of 5.9 hours of excellent gameplay out of it (4.9 hours in the base game and another hour in the bonus chapter).  So, the current list price of almost $10 is a tad high.  If you ever find it for something around $6 or less, leap at it.  It's an excellent game.","October 5, 2015","true","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This one was a nice HOG, with a decent amount of puzzles, and a competent storyline about  an artist a psychopath (Oscar) who has kidnapped your girlfriend (Anna) and plans to make a 3D-Gioconda with her. There's a bonus chapter which is (undestandingly) shorter and a little bit more linear than the main story but was also fun to play. The ending is a bit surprising. On the cons chapter, I'd say the hint system was a little bit annoying 'cause it didn't point you to the right direction (as other HOGs I have recently played do); instead it just said wether there was or wasn't something to do in the current room so sometimes you had to revisit every room to know what was missing (but then again, maybe that's good, that's what many players look for when playing a HOG). I'd say there's a nice amount of job (well) done in this game.
