Fully playable at max settings for me. Props to the dev team for taking care of the issues that the game had at launch!\n\nCarmageddon Reincarnation is a return to a classic series of games that were only about free-roaming fun, splatter and top notch physics (back in the days). If you liked the old Carmageddon games, you will certainly like this one, probably even more; it still has that "PlayStation 1 era" feeling (warning: may cause nostalgia).\nIf you are new to Carmageddon, don't expect realistic driving and "next-gen" graphics (or you'll end up like the majority of the community who expected "changes" to a remake) but prepare for internal organs and in-your-face destruction with power-ups and aggressive car combat.\n\nPROS+ A true Carmageddon game\n+ Free-roaming, detailed maps\n+ Along with classic carma gameplay, new gamemodes are introduced\n+ Challenging AI and Multiplayer mode\n+ The soundtrack\n\nCONS- Handling can be occasionally frustrating\n- No peds in multiplayer (yet)\n- Minor AI problems\n- Not many cars to choose from\n- Lacks optimization and suffers from a few crashes to desktop.\n- Very long loading times\n\nPersonal rating: 8/10 (Erased with the Aug. 2015 patch)","May 24, 2015","true","29.8"," 284 of 328 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","284","328","2","10"

It is without a doubt, Carmageddon!\n\nThere is a lot of talk about performance and what not, and Sure, it's a bit sluggish at times (i7 3770k(stock), GTX 660ti, Soundblaster Z and 8Gig RAM on an x77 AsRock) but does that detract from the fun in a game like Carmageddon this early in its lifespan? I'm normally a stickler for stuttering and tearing and the like, yet after 5~ mins on a track, I only seem to notice the biggest of slow downs and hitches, Peds still have all the charm of the old games so far and the familiar audio queue's are a treat to any fan of the series, They may be more of an issue in a MP scenario but thats not "How I Carma".\n\nThe few tracks/Routes in the game so far (Should change with luck tomorrow, Happy Valentine!) are what we've come to expect from a Carma game, Multi-leveled parks of carnage, from the sea floor to the highest rooftop you can get your tyres on, Jumps and ramps fill the levels that are spattered with tonnes of the Powers and Pickups that made the earlier games so, So much fun! I can't wait to see what else they come up with here.\n\nVehicle handling feels very much like what I remember from Carmageddon 2, and a vehicles attributes will be just as important as ever depending on which way you choose to finish... Race, Smash or Rampage! How do you Carma?\n\nAs a long time fan of the series, finally there is hope on our horizon... smeared with a helping of blood-tinted racing!\n\n:::Update::: Public beta boosted my fps with its defaults, don't expect 60fps on ultra, don't expect it on max, stop cranking every setting to full... I do not drop under 45 fps but for two reasons, Pinball.... and the Replay cam, both result in hard crashes 50% of the time. Seems no triple buffering so turn off Vsync to avoid a 30fps lock or force it on. load times on HDD's are harsh, dust off some SSD space!","February 13, 2015","true","48.1"," 171 of 213 people (80%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","80","171","213","11","0"

Performance is not great at default settings and it currently lacks content, both which were expected.

It was well worth the wait, they didn't spare any details.\n\nThere's also another vehicle, the Shredlight, which seems to have a pretty nice handling, although I haven't played much with it.\nDidn't try multiplayer yet, but there were some balance changes so hopefully it is more enjoyable now!\n\nPerformance remains roughly the same, on my rig at least.\n\nCan't wait for all the stuff coming next year!\n\n\n\nOld update:I can only recommend this game even more with the latest patch!\n\nVisuals have improved by a good bit, especially on vehicles and overall atmosphere. Game looks quite sexy as long as you have a decent rig.\n\nThere were also performance improvements but I don't have anything to say about that as I did upgrade my computer, so I don't have a reliable comparison between the latest patch and the previous one.\nI can, however, say that the game runs pretty well, all options maxed out at 1080p (left vsync off for obvious reasons), without the slightest hint of stutters on the following hardware:\n\nResumed Specs:Intel i7 6700K\n16GB RAM\nGTX 970 Gaming G1\nSamsung 850 EVO SSD 250GB\n\n\n\nOld review below:\nI've owned the game for a while now, as a paypal backer, and I can finally recommend it to everyone, even for those who have average systems.\n\nThe gameplay has always been good and is a welcome improvement over their first two games, with welcome additions. Definitely a lot of fun, thumbs up!(let's skip the black sheep of the family, TDR2000, since it was not made by Stainless Games)\n\nAfter the last update, it indeed runs much, much better than it did, and is perfectly playable without annoying low performance issues (such as stuttering, stalling, and overall low FPS).\n\nPros:Play your own way on this fun gameplay, based on the first two games. Either race like a pleb, wreck your opponents or go after these on-foot running ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s. Has a few extra gamemodes that were not seen in any of the previous Carmageddon games.\nUnique levels, no other 'racing' game has this much vertical creativity going on.\nIncredible damage technology, twist and wreck your car like no other game.\nCrazy selection of vehicles, nothing like wrecking some supercars and sports cars with your big ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• plowing industrial machine. You have pickups, jet powered cars, dragsters, off-road SUVs, lowriders, industrial machines, sports and race cars, monster trucks, buggies, even a killin' hearse. And then you got the cops.\nPeds. Nothing like running over these little ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and watching the blood splash everywhere.\nGood soundtrack. Not the most varied (3 artists, this is an indie game after all), but I think it fits the game well.\nLots of powerups to use and abuse.\nIt's Carmageddon.\nCons:Some of the engine sounds are underwhelming, especially sports cars.\nSome vehicles need a bit more balancing on their handling side.\nNot a game issue, but some people are too lazy to wait on a multiplayer lobby, leaving it quickly instead of waiting a minute or two to get more people to join. If everyone leaves, then of course we can't start a session!\nWhile it's not perfect (no game is), it no longer has major performance issues, which was the only real issue I had with it.\n\nI have to say, some people here on the Steam reviews really exaggerated the issues it used to have, the game didn't run nearly as bad as some of these reviews say.\nProbably because some of these not-so-bright guys were complaining about the game not running on their so called fancy i7 laptop with an integrated GPU. Just because you got ripped off on a crappy laptop and scream of buyers remorse, it doesn't mean it's the games fault that it runs slowly.\n\n\nResumed Specs:i3 540 @ 4.21Ghz (it's still a slow CPU)\n8GB RAM\nGTX 460 1GB (that was considered a mid range GPU back in 2010/2011, for all you whiners out there)","August 27, 2015","true","75.6"," 91 of 107 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","91","107","0","0"

Basically, its a ridiculous, fast-paced, balls-to-the-wall race, except you can take out the other racers with impunity and destroy some oblivious pedestrians along the way.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MerpLife/recommended/249380/","MerpLife","Merp Life","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MerpLife/","218 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCaveat:\nI wish my rating could be something other than "recommend/do not recommend"; If you're only interested in a Facebook style thumbs up or down, stop reading now and take my wavery, not-very-up thumbs up. If you want insight, read onwards! I played the original Carmageddon series back on a Pentium II, and this game is a bit like viewing those old memories through a funhouse mirror. With cracks in it. And smeary graffiti. It works, but it has serious flaws.\n\n1 - Graphics and audio. Everyone likes to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• on this game for the look of it, but the audio has more glaring problems!\n\nFirst things first:\n\nYour budget PC is NOT going to run this game well at all. Seriously. Even a higher end gaming rig will have periodic issues.\n\nOne very important thing to remember about the look and feel of a game like this, is that the levels are gobsmack enormous by comparison to Dudebro Hallway Shooter 2015. I do environment art. I understand concepts like polygon budgeting, texture management, and so on. It's actually remarkable that for the size of the play area and the moments of physics intensity, it's as detailed as it is. Yes, things aren't as pretty as you'd like them to be when you view them under a microscope. Most of the time, you're whipping past at  speed. If you're sitting by the wayside nitpicking about the LOD of a lamp-post, you're playing a game wrong. In spite of the lower LODs, this game is visually, a well-done homage to the original Carmageddon art direction, taking better elements from both Carmageddon and Carpocalypse Now. This will not sit well with those of you who take your gaming in chest-high-wall-sized bites.\n\nOn the audio side of things, a particularly annoying audio bug keeps popping up where the game decides to abruptly lose half or more of its sounds; Lots of choppiness, missing playback and worse. It's almost reminiscent of an old DOS game hitting the playback limit. For a game that's supposedly hitting release in only two weeks, there are some ugly seams still showing. And then there's the split personality the soundtrack has. On the one side, you have edgy sounding wanna-Goth stuff from Morgue, and the other, more true-to-style growling guitars and percussion from Maximum Sexy Pigeon. Kinda wish there was an option to just turn off the tryhard Morgue side of the soundtrack and settle back into the oldschool Carmageddon feel MSP brings to the table.\n\n2 - Playability. Prepare for crashes and uneven performance, but it's fun while it works!\n\nReincarnation has struck a balance between sticky arcade physics and lovingly crafted wheel-by-wheel physics simulation, making for a challenging, but easy enough driving experience. Heaven help you if you don't know how to feather keyboard presses quickly, though, it's stupidly easy to lose control. And you're going to crash. A lot. Your car will crash. Your opponents will crash. And your game will crash. Almost as often as the other collisions. This is not hyperbole; It's almost a coin-flip whether or not a race-end menu and/or race load will send me crashing to desktop.\n\nYou will need patience. The long load times don't help, but see the earlier points about gobsmack huge environments. The. Levels. Are. ENORMOUS. This will lead to needle in a needle stack moments of frustration, and don't even try to kill all the peds on a large level. Just don't. It's an exercise in frustration. It's a straight shot to the Banality of Evil trope. And compared to the original Carmageddon games, you'll wonder if the Eagle went in for repairs and came back with cardboard body paneling instead of honest steel. Every car but the Caddy is squishy, for some reason... the old back-and-forth rolling slugmatches of Carmageddon are no more.\n\n3 - Bang for the buck. Cheap thrills ahoy!\n\nOkay, it's starting to get repetitive, 25 hours in. But so did the original Carmageddon. The difference is, unlike Hallway Shooter 2015 and/or Story Driven Narrative Viewer 2015, there's replay value here. Weird things will happen. The game will surprise you. And it's popcorny enough that it can be consumed in small doses without having to worry about committing to a three hour session. It's brainless, and so far, has cost me about thirty cents an hour for mindless fun. Good!\n\n4 - Should you buy it?\n\nMaybe. I'm disappointed in Stainless for kicking an under-baked product out the door. Crashes, egregious glitches and uneven performance almost outweigh the gory, vicariously indulgent snippets of Carmageddon poking through. I'm still having fun with it in spite of the frustrations, though some later Career levels are almost keyboard-snappingly tedious/annoying. This is not a release-ready title, there are too many bugs and inconsistencies. I do know this much, though; This is the last straw on the camel's back, I will no longer be purchasing Early Access titles. "Release" implicitly seems to be "We're low on money and need to move on" in modern Early Access terms.","April 9, 2015","true","33.8"," 55 of 81 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","55","81","2","2"

If you were one of the origonal carma players as i was then you will probably have fond memories of old ladies (or zombies before splat pack came out) flying up and down your windscreen as you pull off that "Cunting Stunting" bonus. You will also likely remember the countless reiterations of the game such as TDR 2000, dont let these other carma titles put you off AT ALL ! Carma's back baby, and its better than ever.\n\nThe Good:\n\n- New "soft body" technology allows for cars to be crushed and crumpled like never before.\n- Driver (Max Damage) flys out of the car on high impacts resulting in funny (gore filled) crashes. (No Die Anna at present)\n- Hugh attention to detail i.e when repairing your car, all the parts fly back into place (like that crappy Terminator movie).\n- Padestrians are back and there more 'squishy' than ever !\n- The blood pools the  padestrians leave behind often just litter the roas ... as well as the body parts them selves ofcourse .\n- Good physics and car handling, fast cars feel rappid, heavy cars feel like your driving a shed/ garage with wheels. Perfect !\n- Level design is unique and interesting offering very different enviroments and amazing oppertunities for multiplayer.\n- In game sound (cars and padestrians) is great, hearing your engine powering along make's the game feel more dirty.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- As the game is in pre alpha the performance side of the game can be given a little slack, it will however be sluggish with bad frame rates on about 60% of all computers. When i say bad frame rates it can drop to an average of 22-23 fps, this drop isnt much but when your hurtling along at 100mph with a corner approaching, it can make life fustrating.\n\n- In game crashes (as i have experianced so far) are few and far between, how ever the game does seem to have a problem with simply just slowwing down as if it were stuck at 5fps, this could be just my computer or some sort of memory leak after playing for so long.\n\n- Curenttly no multiplayer, but this can be forgiven due to how early in development the game is, the single player side of things at the moment can only hold its own weight for so long before you want some real opponents to bash\n\n- Which leads me on to the games current AI, who simply ... are the dumbest drivers ever. often i find them plowed into walls and acelerating forward to try and get out of it. Also, they all seem to hate me, rather than go for each other, they all seem to want  to kill me .. and only me.\n\n\nThe Ugly:\n\n- Game updates are few and far between, but are massive when they do come (last update was 11gig !!!)\n- As thoughs of you with smaller hard drives may find out, the game is about 20-30gig which will chew through hard drive space, as they add things to the game i can only imagain that this would get bigger (thoes of you with 1TB need not worry its ony us with 500gig hard dries that need worry )\n- Dependent on your pc it seems that the game will either be stable or unstable, my friend cant play the  game with his pc yet mine plays if fine, the only differance between our PC's is the graphics cards, i went Nvidia he went Radon. Ram processor and all other parts are litrally identical.\n- Ingame music, now dont get me wrong, im a rather  big fan of Fear Factory and there song Zero Signal, but currently this is the only song in the whole game, which can drive you mad (no pun intended) . Lets hope they add the rest of all the old Carma songs, because its just the perfect music for the game !\n\nSo that concludes my review, over all i would give this game 8.5/10 - but thats blood good for a pre alpha with no multiplayer, if multiplayer is implimented id rais taht to a 9.5/10.\n","June 18, 2014","true","21.4"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","27","33","0","0"

While it could be said that the game should have been released in a finished state to begin with, it's still good to see them enthusiastically updating the game constantly, despite the less than stellar reviews. After the second, 7 GB update, the game is finally what it should have been on release. While it's never going to be an AAA beautiful game, it's finally properly optimised, a LOT more pleasant to look at, and fun to play, especially if you've played the original.","October 29, 2015","true","6.8"," 33 of 44 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","33","44","0","0"

So I've been following development on the game, since day one. And I can't say that I'm blown away by the final release, as it has a few technical issues. For the most part, the framerate is quite inconsistent - though turning off V-sync or running D3DOverrider, seems to help a bit with that particular issue.\n\nTechnical issues do hamper the overrall experience, but there is fun to be had here. It's pretty much Carmageddon, as you remember it, in a shiny new package, with a  couple of added game modes and power-ups. So if you never liked Carmageddon to begin with, this probably wont convince you otherwise. But if you like squishing peds and crushing cars, whilst being assaulted by crude, sexual innuendos, then it just might be for you!\n\nIt doesn't reinvent the wheel and it's a little rough around the edges, so I can't quite recommend it in it's current state, but hopefully a few patches and mod support will iron out the kinks down the line.","May 21, 2015","false","27.3"," 110 of 180 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","110","180","3","5"

I remember in Carmageddon 2 and even TDR 2000 there were so many hidden places to go, buildings, underground caves, rooftops, random floors in buildings you somehow found all with powerups and peds in that just made the old ones so fun. You'd find something new every time!\n\nReincarnation just feels so empty. What happened to all these small things that made the game so great. Graphics limitations perhaps? Well I'd rather play C2 any day of the week compared to this.\n\nI used to be an active member of the C2 community, not just in terms of forums but me and my friends used to 3d model and design cars for the game too. It was so much more of a flexible and versatile game, modding it became second nature.\n\nThere used to be so much more content to these games. I guess maybe alot of people would never have even seen the side to the classics that I have and played it "vanilla" the entire time and if that's the case then maybe it's good in that sense? It does have some good features about it and it still fills me with feelings of nostalgia but at the same time it just feels like THERE IS ALOT MISSING.\n\nFor me Carmageddon was never just about smashing cars up and running over pedestriams, it was about the maps, does anyone even remember the Airport levels in C2 for example? There would actually be planes taking off and landing, or the maps where you could just push a giant boulder down a hill for a laugh and kill peds or cars with it? or the street maps with actual traffic?

VERY often... it's basicaly a regular thing... some textures won't even load fully (at least i think because the road texture looks like it is from Golden Eye N64 for me)\nThere are numerous glitches with the water rendering especialy when inside water sometimes the whole world just disappears and you only see things (barels) that are 1m infront of the car. happens sometimes even when coming out of water.\n\nThe camera (please switch to rotating camera from default because the default back looking camera is AWFULL) it often gets inside buildings.\n\nLoading times.... oh my god... it takes AGES to load i mean... it takes about a minute to load a race and about 30 seconds to go back to the menu...\n\nSome of the races don't work at all and just give an error.\n\nThe game has great potential if they listen to the community AND I HOPE THEY WILL! because if not... then this game is going to have the reputation of being the worst of all Carmageddon games...\n\nThe Gameplay is great and the new powerups are too although it could stull use more... maybe i just haven't found them but  for example a pedestrian map, or a flying car (where the wheels rotate downwards and you can hover).\nthe pinball powerup slows the game down way too much... it's because it bounces around objects too...\nthe afterburner powerup was made worse from the older games by lifting up the front of the vehicle\nit shouldn't imo. although the Hotrod powerup should.\nIt would be great to see the opponent ejector powerup (ejects the driver) if the driver had to run back to the car to drive it ,and if you killed him ,then the car would be just there not driving itself -.- (you'd still have to blow it up)\n\nThe physics are okay sometimes a bit too slidy (not enough friction).\ni like how the car sticks to the walls a little bit  if you have some speed. It makes ramp stunts a lot easier.\n\nI like how you can flip over your car if you get flipped over but the button to do so is the same as respawning the car so i often unintentionaly respawn myself instead of just flipping myself over.\n\nThe opponents are very dumb... almost brainless (it was somewhat excusable in Carma 1 but it could be improved here) they follow some basic rules and sometimes are way too easy to destroy (at least for my expectations on normal difficulty).\nbasicaly the game becomes way too easy after the first 2 races of getting used to the driving.\nAll in all the gameplay is mostly there.\n\nit's great to see that it has controller support with different presets. Plug and play, easy. (Xbone controllers too)\n\nunfortunetely i cannot recomend this game in it's current state as many people wouldn't enjoy it and get the full carmageddon experience out if it. i have played through all the Carmageddon games and the first game was my favourite.\nthis game tries to imitate and improve a lot of things but it needs a LOT of polish before it can be called a Good Carmageddon game\nthe only reason i'd recomend you buy thi game right now is because you get all the Carmageddon games for a very low price.\n\nDevelopers please fix these bugs/problems so everyone can enjoy this soon to be amazing game.","March 14, 2015","false","4.1"," 33 of 47 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","33","47","0","1"

I may update this when the final release comes out.\n\nThis game is Carmageddon to its core.  If you played the originals and understand what I mean, stop reading this and buy it immediately.  If you didn't play the originals read on:\n\nThe only mode available in the current build is "Classic Carma" where you get 3 goals: Race Normally (all checkpoints and laps), Kill every pedestrian or Wreck all opponents.  You can try to do a classic race, which works, but it's not why you're playing this game.  Run over pedestrians for goofy gore and smash opponents to get points and time.  You pick up power-ups like the "Stretch Goal" that literally stretches your car out horizontally, looking incredibly silly.  There aren't that many powerups in this build but the original had things like Pedestrian Zapper, which shot lightning at every nearby pedestrian killing them instantly and giving you a ton of points, and Pinball Mode, where everything bounced like it was a pinball hitting the bumpers, making the same noise.  It's goofy and insane and so much fun.\n\nI can only guess at what the graphics will look like in the final build but in this build they look fantastic.  The classic cars are there and look great.  There's an insane level of destruction detail in both the environment and on the cars.  Every crunch you make with either another car or that annoying turn barricade, that you inevitably hit, gives great feedback both visually and audibly.  Your car can take a lot of punishment but you can't drive very well with just a wheel remaining, the other three having been knocked off somehow.  Luckily you can repair for a price at anytime.\n\nThe physics are also definitely going to be updated but they are great at the moment.  The cars have weight and you can tell the difference between a light sports car with knives attached and a heavy tow truck, not just in acceleration.  It's visceral and utterly fantastic.\n\nIf you're looking for an insane arcade racer with lots of low-brow humor and over the top everything, this is a must buy.  If you're not, then you're missing out on a fantastic game.","March 13, 2014","true","7.5"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","22","29","0","0"

I've wanted a Carmageddon reboot/sequel/prequel/anything for more than a decade. I've played on and off since early access (I dunno why Steam says I've only 2.4 hours on record and 0.3 in the past two weeks; I've played way more than that), and I've given the devs lots of leeway in my opinion as the game has evolved. "Next patch..." I'd tell myself. "Final release will be better...."\n\nThe graphics look like something c. 2002. The load times are sufficient for you to go grill a steak while you're waiting. Enemy car AI, if you're playing single-player, just isn't challenging. But the worst - the game's true colors - come out when you think about car handling.\n\nI've tried playing with a mouse/keyboard combo, an X360 controller, and a Saitek X52. None are ideal. The game treats vehicle handling as if you're racing on the moon. And the moon has been dipped in molten steel and allowed to freeze. And the steel is coated with silicone-based lubricant. And your vehicle's tires are bald. And, well, you get the idea.\n\nIt's not worth it to wait a day or two for a level to load, only to be faced with cars that look like jellybeans in both detail and color, which handle like you forgot to put snow tires on while the streets are covered in sheet ice.\n\nNo thanks. As rewarding as it feels to wreck an opponent's car, you either need the patience of a tortoise or the luck of a leprechaun to accomplish it. Again, I'm deeply disappointed at the reincarnation of Carmageddon - and everyone besides the game's inevitable apologists are likely to agree.","May 22, 2015","false","7.6"," 52 of 83 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","52","83","2","7"

If you can ran GTA5 all maxed out on 60fps - you probably can ran Carma all maxed out and hit at least 30. With accent on probably, be warned. Even fixed loading times (yeap, I've even tried to install the game on 5yo HDD with almost no impact on loading times, so if you don't have those funky expensive SSDs in your trusty old rig - you won't suffer). Steam Overlay can cause severe frame drops though when you get achievos or someone writes you. For some reason. And the game looks a bit better now too. So I'm changing my review to 'thumb up'.\nTime to buy booyz. This is Carma with all stuff you expect from Carma and more. With great music too (as long as it isn't some god awful dubstep). Looks a bit better than previous games in series, and not on par on any recent game. But who cares as long as you can run over peds and bump into opponents. AI is dumb AF though, they often run in circles god know why. Car physics feel wierd, but nothng you can't get used to.\n\nMy only gripe now is that, sadly, it's a racing game without any sort of local multiplayer, no hotseat or split screen. I understand split screen is ton of work, but hotseat party mode could be great fun too and a lot easier to implement. After all it's the game that relies on replayability.

When it came out and I first tried it, I was still excited. Then it slowly dawned on me: this game is a complete ripoff of their original Carmageddon game, with almost nothing new added. It feels, sounds and plays EXACTLY the same. I'm serious, even the sound effects are the same, the levels are the same only with relatively better graphics (still looks outdated), and even the cars are the same.\n\nMaybe I misunderstood the aim of the project, but if I knew it was only going to be a remake, I wouldn't have bothered. The original Carmageddon formula was a novelty at the time when it came out, and the destruction and mayhem is still certainly fun today, but some things just aged very badly. One of those things is the driving mechanics. I'ts horrible, slow, unwieldy and just plain un-fun. Driving games just became so much better since then, so I don't understand why painstakingly reproduce the same boring driving mechanics, when it could have been so much better.\n\nA game that I hoped for is a modern, fast-paced, action packed take on the carmageddon franchise, with the same brutal fun that it used to be, but with modernized driving mechanics.

There is a nice number of image quality options to play with, too.\n\nNext thing you'll notice is that there is a very nice number of tracks, cars and game modes. I can see dozens or perhaps hundreds of hours here. And I don't even play multi...\n\nI was blown away by the game the moment the first race began. I don't even know where to start here... The physics are as great as they have always been in the Carmageddon games. They nailed the driving model, too. The AI is really aggressive, and it's a joy to race and trade paint with them. The graphics are beautiful! Having Vlad's dragster coming at you at full speed, with these huge flames coming out of its exhausts, is absolutely awesome! The graphics were never the biggest star in Carmageddon, but man this has changed. This game is a joy for the eyes, and combined with the great physics it is a total blast. The music is very fitting as well, it's mostly hard-rock, and I once got a dub step track, too, that was surprisingly tolerable.\n\nPerformance was very nice on my machine, an i5 4690k with 8gb of RAM and a 4gb AMD R9 290 GPU. Streaming to my laptop worked nicely as well.\n\nThis game will become a classic. I want a physical release please!","March 14, 2015","true","11.0"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","19","27","2","4"

This game simulates a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• ton of physics. It's really fun and awesome, the tech is impressive. The handling finally feels good, you can feel the cars and the impacts between them. The damage model is the best you will ever see in a game to date. Every car can become a scrambled can, no "patterns" or limitations a vehicle can get deformed, everything is simulated based on the characteristics of the cars and the strength and angle of the impact. Multiplayer is a blast. Also, also the game stays to its roots if you are a fan of the original games, it is a Reincarnation after all. The whole experience you get for the price is unbelievable. The only two drawbacks are not the ideal performance and visual quality. Personally, while the graphics aren't groundbreaking, I love the style of the visuals, it fits the game really well. Performance can always be better but they are working on it constantly and will continue to work on it after release.\n\nEDIT: And update just came that increased the performance by A LOT. My CPU doesn't even reach recommended requirements, but on most maps I get at least 55 fps at 1920x1080  on highest settings exluding car reflection quality (which isn't the main visual setting that makes the game look cool). And this is only the first update of many to come. They said that the major performance improvements and more content, is still yet to come.\n\nEDIT nr2: Another update. The game runs even better, tons of bug fixes, multiplayer balancing, many improvements across the board. Most importantly, the game now looks really, really good. Go see the new screenshots/videos. It looks better AND it runs better than before. I can't stress this enough, this is a different game than the one you saw on the release date. The devs really put a lot of hard work into the game and it's now trully amazing!\n\nTL;DR new updates, performance now is more than acceptable, the game now looks really good, more content and more major performance improvements are still yet to come.

This time Carmageddon: Reincarnation gets the low-down.\n\nFirst of all, I have a huge nostalgia of the original Carmageddon game, so take from that what you will. Onwards!\n\nI've played this game now for roughly 6 hours, so I have had a good taste of what this game has to offer. First up I felt like I was smack bang in the action from the word Go! The nostalgia of the cars, especially the first one you are given is obvious, and the crazy handling seemed reminiscent of the original game as well. The first race is more of a trial, with an integrated tutorial to help you get the hang of the game and what you're supposed to do - although NOT EVERYTHING appears to get explained - I had myself to find out a few races later how I could switch weapons/power-ups. So, this tutorial could have been implemented better; still, I'm not complaining too much.\n\nThe game modes are great from what I've played, and seem more like Insane 2 racing game (minus the obvious pedestrians!) than what I remember of the original carmageddon. This looks to be well implemented, and I've really had a blast trying to complete classic carmaggedon races in the three different modes (complete the race, take out all other cars, and wipe out all peds - excuse the pun). Overall, some good diversity with the other modes going on as well. The sound is pretty good, and I don't notice too much repitition cos there always seems to be a lot going on anyway. Graphics look ok, though not amazing given this is meant to be a new game (Bugbear's game looks a lot better).\n\nSo, you really want me to tell you what's wrong now I guess? Like others have already mentioned, there are looooooooooooooooooooooong loading times, there is illogical lagging in game as well for seconds at a time, and ultimately this has put me down to thinking the graphics aren't optimised.\n\nIn conclusion, the lack of graphical optimization makes this game completely frustrating at times, and the loading times are bloody annoying as well. If the devs sort out the graphical lag, then I can forgive the long loading times. Normally I wouldn't buy EAG, but I bought this half price cos I saw the classic Carmageddon games being bundled in with this as well. At full price you will get frustrated, and probably not get your money's worth of enjoyment. I will be glad to change this from not recommended to recommended if the lag/graphical issues are resolved. Do it for us, devs.","March 22, 2015","false","9.0"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","5"

Load times are still abysmal even on an SSD, but that's minor compared to the horrible performance of the past. Additionally, there are new features made available for free that make it even better than it already was. Finally, I can enjoy this one without feeling ripped off :)\n\nTL;DR Enjoyable 90's-throwback gameplay, but questionable performance.\n\nStraight up, I am a huge Carmageddon fan. I bought and played through every game several times, even the censored zombie and robot versions and TDR2000. So of course, I had to back the new one on Kickstarter as soon as I saw it. With that said, Carmageddon Reincarnation is something I question spending all that cash on.\n\nWe‚Äôll come back to that, but here‚Äôs the setup: Carmageddon Reincarnation is the fourth official entry in the series that began back in 1997 on MS-DOS. It's a racing game with a nonsensical, graphically violent, comedic slant, acting as a tribute to movies like Death Race 2000 and The Road Warrior. Stainless Games, the developer of the first two and easily the games in the series, are back again to bring this gore fest of a racer to the audiences of 2015. Of course, quite a bit has changed since the 90‚Äôs, and gory games rarely draw crowds based on gore alone like they used to. So beyond the copious guts, the main draw of Carmageddon is the vehicular destruction and racing, and Reincarnation brings its A game in that regard. While you can play a free race using any cars and tracks you‚Äôve unlocked, it‚Äôs the career mode that features the blood-soaked meat of the game. Just like old times, you‚Äôll select from either Max Damage or Die Anna, which come with their own unique cars to start out with. Then you‚Äôll progress through the career as fast as you can manage, with each race having a different set of objectives to complete.\n\nBut unlike many other racers, Carmageddon is all about freedom to do whatever the nuts you want. If you don‚Äôt want to run through checkpoints, why not just run through opposing drivers instead? Or slice through those squishy pedestrians, earning time and points the more creatively you murder them? However, not all races allow you to win in this way, since there are other modes that force you to play by the rules. Sort of. For instance, there are races where you‚Äôll have to race through certain spots on the map or run over select pedestrians, and whoever first reaches the set number wins. But if you don‚Äôt want to bother, you can always try to destroy the drivers that are playing by the rules, and for each kill you‚Äôll steal a point of theirs. So even when restrictions appear, there‚Äôs always an alternative and often more enjoyable method. It‚Äôs the Carmageddon way. And each race takes place in a completely open map, so you‚Äôre free to roam around looking for cool stuff, usually in the form of power-ups. All the classics from the old games are back, and there are plenty of new ones that up the daft sadist factor by a solid amount. You can now stack several of them too, so anything you collect that isn‚Äôt controlled by a timer can be kept in your inventory and deployed at will. It‚Äôs just as fun as ever to turn your car into granite, make pedestrians explode on contact, or repel other cars with giant springs. And yes, the power-downs are all here as well, making it an enticing gamble to collect any pickups. But it‚Äôs also a game that‚Äôs quite forgiving, since you can always repair or reset your car at any time, even if you‚Äôre out of points to do so or have been completely wasted. And I absolutely love how when you repair your car, the parts come flying in from wherever they fell off, slicing through anyone along the way back to you.\n\nIn regards to the physics, I have no complaints as a Carmageddon 1 and 2 fan. The cars feel heavy, the handling feels slick, and the damage model is as impressive as it‚Äôs ever been. The way cars deform, crumble, and fall apart, from the bumpers all the way down to the chassis, is uniquely satisfying. (Although I haven‚Äôt found a way to shear my car in half like you could in Carmageddon 2, but maybe I just wasn‚Äôt trying hard enough.) It‚Äôs important in these games to feel powerful yet vulnerable, because one lucky hit from an opponent or a police car will absolutely ruin you even at full health. Of course, not only can unlock more cars, you can also upgrade cars with armor, power, and offensive upgrades. You can even change the paintwork and rims now, which is a very welcome touch when you‚Äôre trying to max out a specific vehicle but get bored of the same look. Upgrades work similarly to Carmageddon 2, in that you have to find APO upgrade tokens hidden around the maps which allow you to place upgrades. But this time, you can only earn upgrade slots as you level up your profile in career mode, which is done by earning career experience points during each race. The more you suck though, the more points you‚Äôll spend on repairs and resets, and the longer it‚Äôll take to level up. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm sold on this personally, because it‚Äôs one of those systems where you‚Äôll have to replay certain missions over and over just to grind an arbitrary number of points to progress. There‚Äôs plenty of gameplay and replaying of each map without being held back like this, so I wish you could just give career levels the finger, like every other rule in the game.\n\nThere‚Äôs something else I‚Äôd like to give the finger to: the performance. The graphical performance in Carmageddon Reincarnation sucks. My system easily surpasses the recommended specs and can play any other open world game at consistently high frame rates with ease. Even on low graphics settings with a 4GB GTX770 Superclocked and FX-8350, I can barely reach an average of 40fps here, and it‚Äôs not uncommon at all for some stages to run in the single digits. Not only that but the load times are abysmal, taking up to two minutes to load certain races, and this is running on an SSD. For a 2015 game that looks like something from 2005, this is unacceptable. I can accept low-quality graphics, but not with low performance on top of that. And that‚Äôs just single player, multiplayer is even worse, which is a shame because online Carmageddon is always a blast.\n\nAnd this SHOULD be a blast, because overall I‚Äôm very happy with how Reincarnation turned out. When it was running half-decently, I was grinning like a doofus, completely content with smashing up post-apocalyptic cars and crashing through pane glass windows while literally farting on my opponents. But when things get even slightly chaotic, things slow to a crawl or even straight up enter slideshow mode. It‚Äôs sad, because otherwise I‚Äôd have little problem recommending this at its asking price. The performance has improved since the beta, that‚Äôs for sure, but it‚Äôs still completely unplayable on one of my systems, and barely playable on my best PC. So until this is fixed, hold out for a sale. While the fun is there, the ability to fully enjoy it without a very specific computer setup is not. At any rate, there‚Äôs at least a new game in the chaotic Carmageddon series to enjoy now. I just wish the only chaotic thing about it was the gameplay, instead of the playability.","May 22, 2015","true","8.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","11"

I didn't have any crashes (unlike the last time a couple months ago), but the graphics are laggy even on low-med, and the slowdown is real on certain events (like pinball). That all said;\n\nCRAZY FUN. The cars, the tracks, the power-ups, the action, the race styles, all come together to make an absolutely exhilarating experience.\n\nThe tracks are well put together with the action in mind, expanding onto multiple levels. The cars are varied in control styles and all very fun to drive. The humour, while not normally my style, fits into and enhances the game as a whole.\n\nMake no mistake, it is Carmageddon. The proper rebirth of the series with a graphic and technological spruce-up of the original (if not very visible at this stage, see forewarning), and some elements either brought from Carma2 or new creations, this keeps all the fun of the two originals. (we don't talk about the other one)\n\nThe multiplayer, which was the longest fun of the old ones, is even more fun with friends, but the game's optimization at this stage is unfortunately even more apparent, with FPS dipping even further than in SP and occasional disconnects. Very much looking forward to the optimization progress on this front.\n\nWhile the problems of the beta are still apparent, the progress is real and visible; with almost if not all of the content already there, optimization and improvements is the main focus of the developers, which is a cause for relief and hope after seeing many other projects fall behind their own ambition.\n\nIf you loved the old Carmas, there can be no reason to not go for it. If you haven't but it seems like your thing, maybe wait for it to get closer to its proper form and see for yourself then, but my cynicism has been dispelled by the beta already.","February 23, 2015","true","15.9"," 23 of 36 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","23","36","0","0"

I don't mind the bad graphics and thankfully my PC has the resources for this game to hog, but in its current form the cars are just totally unresponsive and just start spinning out no matter what you do. The irony is that you're supposed to run down peds, hit other cars, maneuver around to get to strategically located checkpoints... but you can't even swerve onto the sidewalk to hit a ped without going into a tailspin, it feels like it takes all day to accelerate to hit someone who you end up missing anyway because when you turn you just lose all control.

You don't just 'wreck them' to win.  It's really that damned simple, keep the wrecked the same as it was in the originals.  That's ALL you had to do...\n\nInstead, they have turned it into a modern shooter with cars, where your enemies simply respawn on dying.  I'm sorry, but that's not Carmageddon...  The game was about winning the race by wrecking all your opponents to stop 'them' winning.  To remove this and just have them respawn makes it's just a race to kill the enemy before they kill themselves.\n\nWhich brings me to the second problem...  The cars have no clout and no speed.  At least early on, which is about as long as I can give this...  I was going full speed, hit someone once, slowed to a crawl and didn't kill them...  The cars just stopped dead.  Couldn't charge him into a wall or anything, just had to reverse, but couldn't do that because the other car simply moved forward at the exact same speed anyway, so restore was the only option.\n\nWhich brings me to my last major bone of contention here...  The loading screens.  They've made an improvement on optimisation I'll give them that, but the loading screens are absolutely atrocious.  I have a fast CPU and a damned good GPU, yet I was sat waiting through 5mins of loading screens for a 10 minute race.  50% loading/playing time is NOT acceptable for a decent rig.\n\nSimply put I cannot and do not recommend this game, not to fans of the originals, or those looking to try it out.","November 28, 2015","false","2.5"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","5"

The new patch has fixed quite a few performance issues, sans loading times (in the works apparently), and added a nice coat of graphical polish.\n\nVehicular combat games have fallen by the wayside, growing up with Twisted Metal and Vigilante 8 it's been a favorite genre of mine for some time. Crashing and blowing up cars is just too fun, so it's good to see a new entry from an old series.\n\nThe levels are huge, unfortunately so are the loading times ;_; but once you're in you can spend while trying to complete the objectives. So while loading may take up a noticible percentage of playtime, it's burried in the time spent running over hundreds of peds or chasing down the last oppenent to wreck.\n\nThe car models look great, especially now. Engines shaking and spikes skewering peds are nice touches. The cars feel unique from each other and mixing it up adds fun and makes each run feel different.\n\nIf you're looking for a car combat game with just the right amount of crass humor ("All the wrecked 'ems!")

The new patch has fixed quite a few performance issues, sans loading times (in the works apparently), and added a nice coat of graphical polish.\n\nVehicular combat games have fallen by the wayside, growing up with Twisted Metal and Vigilante 8 it's been a favorite genre of mine for some time. Crashing and blowing up cars is just too fun, so it's good to see a new entry from an old series.\n\nThe levels are huge, unfortunately so are the loading times ;_; but once you're in you can spend while trying to complete the objectives. So while loading may take up a noticible percentage of playtime, it's burried in the time spent running over hundreds of peds or chasing down the last oppenent to wreck.\n\nThe car models look great, especially now. Engines shaking and spikes skewering peds are nice touches. The cars feel unique from each other and mixing it up adds fun and makes each run feel different.\n\nIf you're looking for a car combat game with just the right amount of crass humor ("All the wrecked 'ems!")

I've been playing these games since the first one and have always loved them. When it was released, I was a little upset that it ran like crap on my PC but my specs were not up to it. After I read reviews about it running like garbage on newer, much higher spec machines, I canceled my plans for a new PC.\n\nSince this recent update, I am in love with this game! It even runs well on my lowest spec core 2 duo machine at medium settings. I just wish there were more people online. My only real complaint is how wonky the suspension geometry is, when you jump and the suspension drops, the wheels "should" have a slight bit of positive camber and a little negetive when it compresses but it is just the reverse in the game. No, it does not effect the handling physics, just a visual thing that bugs weird people like me lol\n\nKeep up the good work Stainless, these updates are really helping and im glad I didn't write a review before this recent update.","August 26, 2015","true","39.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Performance issues aside the new physics feel terrible and at high speeds the cars aren't fun to drive. It's wonky and frustrating even by Carma standards. I wasn't expecting BeamNG.drive quality or a sim racer, but I was at least hoping for what they did with the Android port of Carma 1, but seriously, is asking for a traction model too much? Instead the car jitters like it's resisting oversteer and then spins out.\n\nI think they were trying to make the game more accessible but all of the old Carma frustrations are still there, which will probably drive away newcomers.

For a game with such a sarcastic tone, it takes its progressive gameplay way too seriously.\n\nWell, esthetically the game is pleasing for the fans, and the new ice map is awesome!

They even upped the graphics, making it look better as well as running better.\nWhile the controls are the same, clunky mess, its just not running at -12 fps anymore, so turning and reacting to situations have become easier.\nLoadtimes are still long, but like I've stated several times now; it looks better and runs better so it can be excused for having long loadtimes.\nI'll leave the old review in here, since the game is still the same fun game, its just updated ;)\n\n\nOld Early Access review:\n\nClunky controls, lackluster graphics, long loadtimes, poorly optimized, but this game really grows on you.\n\nIts a remake of one of my most favored childhood games, and its a really good modern interpretation.\nIt keeps the oldschool feel, while updating the visuals. Its still basically Deathrace 2000, and it is awesome!\nWorth most of its value.\n\nThe bad parts are as I mentioned:\nIt has very clunky controls. The cars just does not behave like you want them to. I guess its trying to keep the way the cars handled in the original, but its still fudgin clunky and messy.\nThe lackluster graphics. Yeah, it does not look like a game from 2014 now does it.\nLong loadtimes and poorly optimized. For a game with these visuals and not all that great attention to detail, why does it load this slow and run this poorly? I guess the physics might be to blame, but its not all that impressive, at least when taking the long loadtimes and how it runs into account.\nI do commend them for the "repair" animation though. When your car is getting a severe hammering, repairing your vehicle makes it morph into its original form, while all the lost car parts fly into place from all over the map, its really cool.\n\nAll in all its a fun game, despite its performance and lacking visuals.\nRecommended ;)\n\nBTW, the soundtrack is KICKASS!!!\n\n#EDIT01\n\nI have tried this out on two gaming rigs.\nOne with an I7 970 @3.2Ghz, 8Gb RAM, GTX 670. It ran pretty smoothly with few of the options turned down. 60fps ish.\nAnother with an I7 2600k (I believe), 16Gb RAM, GTX 760. It ran slightly worse than the previous rig at same settings, but it still ran at a smooth enough framerate, ranging from 50-60 fps.\n\nIf you have worse specs than those, be sure to crank the settings down a bit. Don't worry, the game does not really look worse with some options turned down or off.\n\nBut loadtimes are still long, no matter what.","March 11, 2015","true","1.2"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Big Thumbs Up"\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[OLD REVIEW]\nMini first look review, and with my own personal twist to it. Please write to me personal or underneath what you like or what you dislike. I can adept to make it better. And for the grammar and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• sorry! Im a 32-year-old Norwegian, call me a tourist if you want ^^.\n\nBEFORE I STARTED PLAYING THIS HOW WAS MY FEELING OF THE GAME\nOk first of im a fan! Im not going to try to hype and swallow all the mistakes done, but have to be honest about it. Carmageddon is a graphically violent vehicular combat 1997 PC video game. It was later ported to other platforms, and spawned a series of follow-up titles. It was inspired by the 1975 cult classic movie Death Race 2000. The game was produced by Stainless Games, published by Interplay and SCi and best of all it rocked, I back in that day used 4.86 pc and had to play it in 320 x 240 with mini screen not full screenÔÅä. I get so many memories back in those days, when I ‚Äúwas feeling sick from school‚Äù to stay home and drive over old pedestrians in this sick twisted and likeable game.\nWhen I saw trailer about the new one I had to pre order, I hate to do that before I see any screens or game videos but hey, they asked for help on Kickstarter, and I have been waiting for so long.\n\nWHEN I TRIED IT HOW CAN IT BE COMPARED TO THE HYPE I HAD:\nFirst alpha it was kind of ‚Äúweak‚Äù compared to what I expected, with tons of lag and only one or two tracks... Then the publishers was somewhat quiet with nothing news just ‚Äúcheap‚Äù carmageddon 2000 etc... Then they gave us a hind on the valentine day that ‚Äúmy‚Äù game would get out of alpha straight to beta, oh my I was so pleased to hear from them and that they would come with a new patch to fool around with! Day came and patch was not 2-3 gb as I though, it was god damn 10gb! They had fixed everything I was hoping for, so now this game is a good beta with tons of fun that includes less machine requirements and multiplayer works as a charm! That said if you buy this game it is an early version of a game, still being tested for bugs or glitches before being released as a finished product.\n\nTOP three I LIKE\n1. It is so similar to the old one with just lot of new potentials\n2. easy to learn and not that hard to master.\n3. Music and sounds are top notch, or ‚Äúsounds‚Äù are somewhat weird but it seems like they use the old ‚Äúdrive‚Äù over screams from old games! Awesome\n\nTOP 3 I would love to see some changes on\n1. Better pc tuning, because it demands a lot of power from your rig!\n2. Faster loading times.\n3. Nothing more to say\n\nSo overall points by me given are 1/10 where 10 is max.\nSingle player experience: 7-8 it‚Äôs fun to driver laps or skip them to kill cars instead, to win race.\nMultiplayer experience: 9, some crash issues, where my car freeze same happens in single player.\nGraphics:                           7\nDeveloper update game: 7\nDeveloper informing us about their team and state of game: 7/10 after last patch they have become quite good in updates and notifying\n\nIS THE GAME WORTH IT?\ni think this game is worth the buy, and price is not to bad either! personal i think this is a game that wont dissapear from the fun meter that fast either!\n\n\nMy pc specs.\n\nScreen: BenQ 27" 3D LED XL2720Z (1920x1080, 144Hz, 1ms, 12m:1, VGA/DVI/2xHDMI/DP)\nAMD FX (tm)-8350 Eight-Core Processor (8 CPUs), -4.0GHz\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 770 (4gb Memory)\n24576MB Memory\n\n\n\n- Mspaint out","February 19, 2015","true","22.3"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","2"

Shadows and reflections are still the biggest frame rate killers. Seems they have done nothing in in optimizing how their engines pulls those effects off, As turning either of those on above low severely cripples the frame rate.\n\nPATCH UPDATE:    stainless finnally coded the game to multithread, it's made huge frame rate improvements  IGNORE every thing i previously said about the game runnign like s--- in a tub.  it runs great now.\n\n\nThat said with shadows off , AO off and reflections on low  i can keep a frame rate between 29-50 (with heavy Jumps between those two numbers)\nPlayable but sad given the level of "fidelity" this game is out putting. Seriously i can run Far cry 3 and 4 at 45-60 fps on this machine  and this game doesn't have half what those games got going on graphically. I blame the Engine it's self. Often new game engines are the greatest problem for frame rates.  why did Stainless have to make their own engine?  why didn't they just license an engine and save money the end result would have looked better. cry engine 3 and UDK 4 both run better and look better  by miles on my PC compared to this game's engine. Hell even UDK 3 would have been better and that engine came out in 2007.\n\n\nagain you may or may not consider these playable frame rates  but i find it easy to enjoy the game and have  encounterd only a few slowdowns or stutters.\n\nGraphic quibbles out of the way I'm gonna break this down in to several cata-gore-eez\n\nChanges to the career mode (this is not your grandpa's carmagedon)-\n\nthe career mode is awesome.  you can now choose to be Die-anna  or Max , and this choice is also seperate of your car choice (that being you pick your racer and when you change cars as you progress, you stil have that racer).\n\nYou also now can change your car color ... YES!!!  this is something i always wanted in the old Carma games but  well they just never had it.  Now you can make that awesome eagle black, or you can make the hawk pink.  That said the color  choices are not as broad as i'd have hoped for.  other race games let you paint the car  using a color scale like what you'd find in a paint software.  Well that's not here , you just get  to choose from a set of predefined colors.  That's not bad though as the old carma games had no way to change car color so even this limited addition is a fresh breath of air for the series.\n\nGame Modes (new ways to run people over) -\n\nThe death race mode is a much needed addition to the carmagedon series as it actually encoruages you to race as opposed to just smashing the hell out of your opponents.\n\nAlternately the Check point Stampede mode is alsoa  fun addition to the game play.  Very unique mode. it's hard to compare it to any other game's play modes .. just try it out it's fun. I'd say it's like  king of the hill meets capture the flag  all done in fast cars while said hill/flag moves around.\n\nI haven't seen any other game modes  other than those two and classic carmageddon mode, but then i'm not very deep into the game. I'm only a few hours in and I've jsut got to the second set of races.\n\n\n\nOverview thoughts.   Given what I';ve seen and how much i've played already  I'd say the game is looking BIG. Far more massive than the short walk games we have gotten used to today.  Now if only Stainless games would get to optimising it better.  I want at least medium image quality shadows/DoF/MB  on, with medium car reflections  to run at 35+ fps  @ 1080p by the time the game is finished (gold).  If they fall short of that then i may have to rate the game low. There's no reason this game should be so abussive to hardware when it is finished.\n\nOne cool thing about this carmageddon is the cars are best handling ever.  in the old carmagedon games car ahndling was often an issue (especially in 2). well not here most eh cars handle wee , but you stil find your self occasionally flyign around (which is a fun flying around not a "god damn why won't this car respond right" flying around). so yeah car handling is great  and generally designed for maximum fun game play.\nany way as it stands now, a power system is reccomended for sure.  again look at my spec listing above.  Sure my comp is a year old but it is by no means an "average man's (or woman's)"  PC.\n\nALL THAT SAID! ,  AS FAR AS AN EARLY ACESS GAME GOES. THIS ONE IS WORTH IT ESPECIALLY AT THE BETA  BUILD, IF YOU GOT THE HARDWARE TO HANDLE IT.\n\nEDIT:  Grab this game immediately if you are time traveler from 5 years in the future with a super computer!  it is fun when you can get it to run.\n\nPOST PATCH EDIT; worth every penny now that it runs good , running on settings maxed getting 40-60 fps.  I give the final and patched version a 9/10  excellent game i wil likely replay for years to come.","November 24, 2014","true","65.9"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

It saddens me deeply to say this is a major disappointment and is nowhere near a truly finished state. The optimisation and control issues are prevelant, and the advanced AI from Carma 2 is just straight up not there. I'll often find myself struggling to actually attack any of the other cars, who just blindly drive through the laps and basically tell you "eff off I jus' wanna race"\n\nRather than the different decisions and statuses they could have in Carma 2, such as drivers fighting each other, deciding to drive around and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up, chasing you down or trying to do the laps. Then they could be aggressive, become afraid and try driving away at low health, and try and get revenge when you hit them. Here it's just either straight laps or straight aggression.\n\nThe levels feel kinda sad compared to the originals as well, nothing will ever be as great as the city in Carma 2, with all the destructible glass and the big open atmospheric design with the bank that was always full of powerups.\n\nDo yourself a favor and just go for Carma 2, and wait for this to go on a dirt cheap sale.","August 16, 2015","false","9.3"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","2"

The cars are awesome, subtle little changes compared to originals gives them their own style without changing the character. The maps are quite big and use a lot of vertical space, kind of like Maim Street in Carma 2. There's a good mix of old and new powerups too.\n\nMost of the complaints are about frame rate and load times so I'll address those directly:\nThe load times are pretty huge, it does take 30-40 seconds to load a map, sometimes a bit longer.\nI don't have any issues once it's loaded with SLI GTX 670s and an i5 CPU running at 4ghz but my HTPC that runs Grid 2 beautifully is a slide show (1-2 fps) so I guess it's a bit hit and miss.\n\nMy only complaint is how it feels like all the cars have the oiled up tyres debuff. Seriously, make a turn at ~60kph and you slide into a wall. It makes exploring the tight maps and checkpoint stampede really frustrating because it feels like you're steering a boat. I'm sure it'll improve with the handling upgrades but that's a long way off in the campaign. Also the engine sounds get really annoying really quickly (I changed the engine sounds in Carma 2 to an actual V8 and it sounded f*cking amazing).\n\nIt's not the kind of game I can play for hours at a time, but it's awesome for a quick 30 minute destress every now and then :)","April 4, 2015","true","4.4"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

I tried to get the mutliplayer working again and this time instead of the "waiting for games to join" there just wasnt anything to join.   The handling is better but still way too sluggish to be enjoyable i still fishtale and i still cant manage to get any kind of speed and keep control of my car.  It difficult to control even at low speeds often times finding myself either going backwards to make a check point or just barely hitting the side of the check point before spinning out and inevitable facing the opposite direction from where i wanna go.\n\nMy original review was made july 12, 2015 a short time after the game was released.  I've now taken a secound view at the game 6 almost 7 months later and they have fixed a few small things with the game and i applaud them for making an effort.  The game is still however unenjoyable because of the controls.  I have tried using different cars incase the problem was just 1 or 2 cars but all of them seem to suffer from greased tires.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scytheplays/recommended/249380/","scytheplays","Scythe Plays","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scytheplays/","128 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIf you're a fan of the old Carmageddon games and you're wondering "Is this new game just as good?" the answer is YES!\n\nWHAT IS CARMAGEDDON?:\nCarmageddon is like a crazy demolition derby with insane weapons (like zapping pedestrians with lightning or using a gravity vacuum to literally suck parts off opponent cars to name a few)!\nThe best way I could describe Reincarnation is a cross between Mario Kart and Twisted Metal. Depending on the map you select, you're free to explore that entire level at your leisure while having the option to win the match in three different ways.\nThe objective is to either race through all the checkpoints (you can take any route you want to reach them but usually there's a set path your opponents take) or kill everyone before they can finish the race! You can also win by killing every pedestrian on the map, but this is usually very difficult and time consuming.\nThe game also includes bots incase you don't want to play online, which brings us to our next topic..\n\nWHAT'S NEW WITH BETA?:\nI've played both the Alpha version and Beta version and I can tell you there's been a huge increase in performance! The game still isn't optimized very well and requires a pretty beefy computer just to play it on medium settings, but framerate is a lot more stable and the game doesn't feel like it's going to explode anymore.\nThis increase in performance is so noticable, I expect optimization to be completely ironed out on the games full release (it's not going to stay broken).\nI'll also point out that despite the game running perfectly fine for me, I've had it crash more with the Beta version than Alpha.\n\nThe most notable additions for the Beta is the inclusion of an online Multiplayer and a full fleshed out Career Mode with unlockable cars & levels! You can also collect tokens √† la Diddy Kong Racing inside levels. These are spent on new parts for customization. Some just increase a stat of armour, but others have more of a visual impact, like adding a giant drill on the front) XD\nAlso the Beta version now includes every car, but now you have to unlock them (in Alpha everything was unlocked).\nBe warned: I've had the game run without any problems only to randomly crash after completing a match, thus not saving my progress. The Single Player game is technically beatable, but it's not stable enough to do so without repeating a few rounds. Play this game for fun, not to beat it! ..at least for now.\n\nEARLY ACCESS:\nIf you're concerned about this being just another game in Early Access that wants your money but won't be released, that's not the case. This isn't a random indie team with overly high ambitious promises, it's a professional gaming company. The same company that created all previous Carmageddon titles! And if you're concerned your PC can't handle it, Reincarnation will have a console release :)\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nAt the time of writing this review, your purchase of Reincarnation includes Carmageddon 1, 2 & TDR. I think they're always going to have that deal, bit I can't be sure. The inclusion of the classic games is already worth it in my opinion! They've touched up the graphics on the classic games (only a little bit) and some of them even include an online multiplayer :D\nIf you're looking for a solid racing game, Carmageddon might not be for you. The controls are tight for a demolition derby, but I found racing to be the most frustrating aspect.. especially since the cars act more like tanks.\nIf you're a fan of the old games, you won't regret this purchase. Straight up, Reincarnation is like a dream come true for Carma fans and I've been playing every chance I get!\n\nIf you'd like to see the Public Beta in action, check out my First Look :)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDvPLl5q_FI\n\n-Thanks for taking the time to read this review!

Back then, the game was borderline unplayable due to long loading times and sub-standard performance during the game. Would I recommend the game in such a state ? Nope. Not at all. Still, being a fan of the original 2 Carmageddon games (except the mission levels in 2 - screw those) I kept my fingers crossed hoping my money wasn't wasted in the long run, and that TDR2000 would remain the turd in the series.\n\nFlash forward to a few months later with precious little updates from the devs in between, and we're past said February 2015 update. At this point, the game has undergone an engine rewrite, but whoever's building the levels etc. hasn't been idle either.\nThe result so far: A game that might still crash on occasion (have had that happen once), but that is otherwise pretty complete. It runs smooth enough on a medium-powered rig (if you don't set all graphic details to full), and really plays like classic Carma with a few updated twists to it - mostly more moving parts on the maps, and new game modes.\n\nAll the classic stuff is there:\n\n- Most of the cars from 1 & 2, along with a few new ones. (Sadly, none of the new ones from TDR2000 which despite it's flaws does have some fun designs)\n- Classic powerups such as the pinball mode, instant handbrake, and of course the Pedestrian Electro-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Ray\n- Even a number of maps are based off the ones from the old games.\n- And the all-mighty cop cars that will wreck you in short order, unless you come prepared with powerups etc. to take them on. And yes, you'll find them quick enough if you go off track to hunt peds.\n\nThe new stuff:\n- New powerups which are twists on existing ones (anvil launcher to go along the slaughter mortar, tossers & vacuums to go along with repulsificator springs)\n- And just new powerups, such as the Silent But Deadly ped-killing toxic cloud, the Spinnertron which spins your car (yep) and mainly for style bonuses but can help make corners at insane speeds if mastered, and the Pelvic Thrust which is a short but powerful speed boost.\n- New powerdowns are there as well of course, such as "Feelin' Fragile" which boosts damage taken and makes your car look like glass.\n- And new game modes that aren't missions that suck ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. They're mainly objective hunts (checkpoints or peds) or pure races where your opponents will respawn. Wrecking them is still a good way to take and hold the lead though :)\n\nThe car upgrade system has also been reworked- you now have to scout the maps for upgrade tokens during the campaign mode, with the different power levels unlocking along the way too.\n\nAll in all, this is now the Carmageddon I wanted to see. It takes what was good in the first 2, and builds on that. And it's still as politically incorrect and insane as the series ever was.","March 1, 2015","true","4.9"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

The new opus however attempts to recreate the ambience and fun of the first title but ends up being as frustrating as the abysmal Carmageddon TDR. Do you remember the irritating bonus timed stages from C2? Well, some of the levels will give you some flashbacks. On some levels, the game gives you the task to kill a given pedestrian before the other competitors. Sadly, the cars handle like cruise ships and what could be fun ends up being a frustrating and boring exercise with little chances to end up at first place. Add some incredibly long loading times (up to 5 minutes on a fast PC!), very repetitive levels (so long, only two levels repeated again and again and again), sub-optimisation of the performance (my rig runs Battlefield 4 at Ultra settings but this game stutters while looking very average) and a surpringsly crampy, half-slow gameplay.

So far, i've played a total of 5.2 hours, and although those hours were spent in RELATIVE enjoyment, I can't say I love the game, and it's for a few reasons.\n\nThe biggest and most annoying reason being that most cars feel like sleds. It just feels like they barely have any grip at all.\nThis is made worse by my second gripe, the fact that the car gets stuck on stupid things like limbs from pedestrians. I've stopped counting the amount of times i've had to come to a full stop, reverse, and scoot over to the left or right, because there was an arm stuck to the front of my sled, making it handle even worse.\nThirdly, the upgrade system for your cars. Who the hell thought it would be a good idea to add upgrade tokens to carma? Who was it? I would like this person to be publicly punished. What was wrong with buying your upgrades with your hard earned cash?\nAnd then there's the performence issue. The game does not perform very well. It has frequent frame drops, and this makes handling your sleds even harder than it already is.\n\nAll in all, I do enjoy the game somewhat, but I honestly can't say I'd recommend it to anyone in it's current state.

Usually bottle neck is CPU. Game is very CPU heavy. There are some reasons why it is so heavy.\n\nEngine is dated.\nGame engine is actually based on same BRender engine which original games used. Of course it is undergone numerous rewrites, but nonetehles it is old. If you look Stainless games catalog, it is never before used any bigger modern game before C:R. Multicore support is poor, so prosessors with less cores, but more clock speed gets better FPS than prosessors with many cores and low clock speed.\n\nContent of game is oversized in relation to engine.\nPolycount of car's is almost twice as much as WreckFest's car's. Textures are HUGE! But these are not reasons why frame rates are low. Game is not really very GPU heavy. Only things that matter in GPU, is DX11 support and amount of VRAM. DirectX11 support because game uses some DX11 features, if your card doesn't support DX11 it is under minimum specs. Amount of VRAM matters because, like I said, textures are huge. You can play with 1GB VRAM card, but 1GB is absolute minimum. Don't expect texture quality be very good if you have only 1GB VRAM, but it is completely playable. Cheaper graphics card performs well as long as it supports DX11 and have enough video memory.\n\nWhy content is oversized? Stainless wanted to make triple A like game, but got only indie budget, it is due to their megalomania. Also game engine is developed alongside with content creation, artist didn't know what quality to aim. Apparently they aimed too high.\n\nBut biggest reason for low framerates is:\n\nIT IS CARMAGEDDON!\n\nYea, concept of Carmageddon is very resource heavy. Openworld maps, crash physics, hundreds of pedestrians, lots of breakable things.\n\nNot invidually any of these are alone reason, but because they are all included. Optimization is not poorly done, concept os Carmageddon just makes some optimzation techniques impossible to use.\n\nGTA have big open world maps, much bigger than size of C:R. But it uses map streaming, that is not possible in Carma because POWERUPS. More specifially repulsificators. You know that classic powerup, first time introduced in Carmageddon 2, that generates spring from users car and hit any nearby opponent, ped or object, causing them to fly through the air. Because repulsificators can throw you or your opponent through map almost instantly, map streaming is not possible. There is no time to load and unload map parts, their must exist all time.\n\nC:R have peds. GTA too, but in GTA peds spawns randomly and disappears when you can't see them. In Carma this is not possible because peds have fixed amount and places. If peds would spawn in Carma, it would make ped hunting and powerup called ''peds shown on map'' reduntant. So all peds exists all time, of course they are freezed when you can't see them but still they are all time loaded in memory.\n\nIf any other developer would make game like Carmageddon, they would change those two things. But Stainless wanted to keep loyal for their original vision. And if they would have chosen otherwise and cut those things, it would'nt be same game anymore. I rather take less FPS than Carma without powerups or ped hunting.\n\nThat is enough for performance, let's review gameplay because that is where this game shines.\n\nHandling\n\nIf you ask me handling is great. It feels like first Carma's handling but improved. Sure car handles sluggish and there is not much grip, but that is way it always been. It is not purely arcade, actually it has very detailed car physics simulation. It is detailed enough, so you can do everything what you can do with real cars. If you want to powerslide, you just don't pull handbrake car drifts as long as you pull it, but you need to conuter steer, push accelerator like in real life.\n\nIf you get frustated with handling, you are playing game wrong. If you miss head on with opponent, do it with style. Don't park your car in the middle of the road, and start crying why this handling is so bad, why world is so cruel that you didn't managed to kill opponent. Instead of that, just throttle more, use direction indicator as a ramp, fly through the air, hit the apartment house, bounce from wall, fall on the lamppost, watch how lamppost crushes pedestrians when it collapses, laugh manically, repair you car and repeat.\n\nPowerups\n\nThere are many powerups in Carmageddon. Powerup system is not very well balanced, but it doesn't matter. If somebody wreck you with powerups just do same for him. Carmageddon is not about fair play, use every dirty trick from your catalogue to kill opponents.\n\nSome powerups from game:\n\nElectro ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Ray, which electrifies all nearby pedestrians.\nAve Banana, which bends car to banana.\nRepulsificator, comes in three flavours, opponet, pedestrian, object. Spring that strongly pushes anything nearby.\n\nAnd my favourite; ANVIL LAUNCHER. What other game let's you to throw thousands of pounds of heavy anvil toward your opponent. It is one of the most satisfying way to kill opponent, because it is entirely physic based. It destroys everything in it's path. It shortens APC (Which is overpowered car) about meter when it hits for APC.\n\nEarly Acces review:\nIf possible, more surrealistic, violent and insane than first two Carmas. Takes atmosphere of original, crash physics of C2 and take them new level. Sense has no place In Carma world. Drivers crash trough the windshield, cars drives and repairs themselves, there is weird power ups, bad humour, and in general, bad taste. This comic pretty much sums everything it is:\nhttp://www.carmageddon.com/sites/default/files/comic/eng/ep3/index.html\n\nOnly con is it runs pretty poor. You need very good PC if you you want play max-settings. I hope they can optimize it lot before final release. My PC strugles even everything on low. Also it's not very stable, crashes a lot and other little bugs. But those are Pre-Alpha things.","October 15, 2014","true","99.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I played on lowest possible settings, it looked much like Carmageddon 1 (besides the parts flying back to the car) and couldn't stand it for over 5 minutes.\n\nVery anticipated game, very sad to see it like this.\n\n\nI will uninstall this game right away.

Nothing serious and things that you would expect in Beta stage of the game.\n\nIf you were holding to buy it because alpha, now its very enjoyable, but expect some bugs and perfomance issues along with lots of old school carma fun.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFirst, this is pre-alpha so not near to finished product. Keep in mind if you buy this right now yoou're buying a severe cut and bug loaded game.\n\nSecond, BUY THIS, MOAR PEOPLE I think will speed up the full release of this GEM amazing game. I deeply HATE race games, but classic Carma is my most played game of all time, always have time to go back and relax stumping people and stuff.\nBest is they took all the good ideas from the first one, saved the mechanics and the amazing physics this game had(I was playing the same level I used to on the first one in ten minutes to adapt myself and was far from enough) and added pretty cool ideas.\n\nThe scenarios, beautiful mechanics, trains moving, containers falling from sky, flapping doors to kill pedestrians, new specials mechanic...

It feels most similar to Carma 2.  Many of the old opponents and their cars are back, plus a few new ones.  The powerups include most of the previous ones plus some new ones--some are very helpful, some harmful, some just silly.\n\nI never made it through TDR 2000 because for some reason it felt 'off'; fortunately, Reincarnation feels the same as the originals.\n\nThere are other several other nods to the first two in the series:  the action replay recorder is there, multiplayer includes LAN, the Fear Factory theme song, the dismembered hand for a cursor (though it no longer drips blood), some of the same sound effects, etc.\n\nI've only purchased the game recently post-Update 2, which addressed a lot of performance issues.  Performance for me has been good, generally smooth with only occasional stutters when there are a lot of effects on screen.  Running on ~2.5 year old components.\n\nThere are a few differences:  in a section, instead of three regular maps, there will be one regular map (crash, lap, or kill peds) and then two maps with different goals.  You don't need to win or to play all three, just earn enough credits to unlock the next section.\n\nUpgrades are now done by tokens found on maps, and then upgrade must be unlocked through progress.\n\nBesides career mode and multiplayer, there is a free mode where you set the parameters (maps, starting location, number of laps etc)  This is a welcome addition.\n\nOverall, it is the same over-the-top action and silliness.

The Death Race 2000 inspired "racing game" was the most fun "driving" experience I ever experienced on PC. The game's sequel, Carmageddon2: carpocalypse now, was highly regarded an improvement in every category (though I personally liked the first game more due to the better car design). The third game in the series was developed by a different company and was widely regarded as the worst game in the series.\n\nThere hasn't been a new Carmageddon game since the year 2000, and that's a long time to wait. Well, the wait is officially over with Carmageddon: Reincarnation. The game was once again developed by Stainless, who were responsible for the first two games, after a successful Kickstarter campaign.\n\nLet it be known that I was reluctant to buy this game until now due to the horrid optimization it suffered from since its release. The game's frame rate used to drop below 30fps even on high end PC's. Those issues, as of the latest update, are no longer relevant (for the most part). The game runs smoothly 99% of the time, though it still has a hickup here and there. I also had the game crash on me one time, but that's the worst thing I had to experience with this game.\n\nOn top of the optimization, the game also has an issue of (very) long loading times. It takes 1-3 minutes for a level to load. Considering how most matches in this game tend to end in about 10 minutes, that's quite a long time to wait for a game with graphics that won't impress anyone in the year 2015.\n\nSo why am I recommending this? Well, this game is fun. VERY FUN, even. It is the most fun I had with a "racing game" since I don't even know when. The game captures the essence of the first two games perfectly, with (sort of) updated graphics.\n\nEach "race" can be completed via several methods. You can either actually race (which almost nobofy ever does), you can kill all of the random pedestrians, which can be found spread up in some truly bizzare locations in the various open world (ish) maps the game offers, or you can do what most people do in this game - wreck the competition. Wrecking, killing pedestrians and completing racing checkpoints reward you with "money" that can be used to repair your car or unlock new things in the career mode. On top of that, the level has various powerups that can be collected and used to help you with your car wrecking, pedestrian killing habits. Some are quite straightforward, such as an afterburner, while others are quite bizzare.\n\nThe damage effects on the car are quite impressive and look especially cool when you repair your car mid-game. Pieces can fall off your car, which will affect the way your car performs, and repairing the car will have those pieces reattach themselves back on it.\n\nThe game is still getting support from the developer, and hopefully the optimization and loading times will get fully resolved. That said, the game is worth picking up right now for anyone who's looking for some mindless car-wrecking fun.","November 1, 2015","true","53.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

They released an initial patch  on August 25th that increased performance quite a bit but simplified the damage system somewhat.  On October 29th Stainless released a second patch which increases performance again, increases graphic fidelity and brings back the original damage system.

At its recent state, I can recommend the game to not only to carma fans but also to new people to the franchise. The game now runs perfectly well and is mostly bug-free. The game offers replayability and is more than fun to play.\n\nPros:\n+Entertaining\n+Runs smooth (finally)\n+Single maps have much content and variance\n+Awesome destruction modeling for the cars\n+Fitting music\n+Price\n\nCons:\n-Driven by the player, some vehicles don't serve a purpose and are outclassed in every way when compared to other vehicles\n-If played on easy settings and as straightforward as possible, the game is relatively short\n\nSo-So:\n/Map numbers are limited and different races take part in the same maps. This shouldn't come as a surprise to people familiar with the previous games\n/Plot-seeking players should reconsider\n\n\nAll in all, I'd like to congratulate Stainless for the effort of finishing the game, albeit late. I've played through all the Carma games (even the dreadful) and the series has always had a warm place in my heart. Now I can rest at ease knowing that the developer did not abandon the latest spectacle's development after the initial unoptimized and bug-ridden release. While the game lacks some elements typical to a game, like a plot, it delivers hours of entertainment where you can not only win the race by being the first to the finish but also making sure the other competitors don't make it that far.\n\nAfter the latest patch, I'd rate the game 10/10 because it finally runs smoothly on other devices besides supercomputers and because it does not try to be anything it is not and excels at what it is.

The game feels nice if you have carmageddon nostaliga (carmastalgia). It will probably fill that void, but that's it... Recommended mostly for Carmageddon die hard fans. Nothing outstanding, nothing new under the sun basically, true that the game looks somehow prettier now and it runs better. Nonetheless I got bored of it pretty quickly. The Environments feel and look boring, there are a few new cars, but basially just the handful few that are actually pleasant to drive, exactly like in the old game. A few new gameplay modes that are pretty boring too. And the worst things are powerups, one might expect some new interesting ones, but no... Developers could have made a lot of new improvements since the Carmageddon franchise certainly still has a lot of potential. I'm sorry but re-making the same old game with new textures and effects won't cut it.

Once the game was released, however... there were lots of game-breaking bugs - in my case, lots of CTDs, which made the game nearly unplayable for longer than an hour.  However, the latest patch fixed just about every major and minor problem that this game had at launch, so I can now happily recommend it!  Why?  Read on...\n\nGRAPHICS\nCompared to racing games that were released over the last two years, these graphics are fairly simple in comparison, so I expect this game would run really smooth on mid-range computers.  If you played Carmageddon TDR 2000, you may even think they didn't do much, graphically-speaking.  That said, the vehicle damage physics is really good, with deformations, all manners of car chunks falling off based on what hits you, and peds fall apart is various juicy ways.\n\nMUSIC & SOUND\nThe soundtrack is fairly small - you'll hear all the tracks at least once within the first hour of gameplay.  In addition, the tracks used on the main menu are the same ones used when actually playing - they don't stop, in fact, so as you make your selections and load up a stage, the tracks just seemlessly continue.  You may want to consider adding your own custom tracks so what you hear doesn't go stale.  As for sound effects, they're a pleasure to hear when you crunch a ped against a wall, or use your door to pop into someone's face.  The crunching of your car against metal and other obstacles are nice, but nothing outstanding.\n\nGAMEPLAY & REPLAYABILITY\nI managed to blast through the campaign mode (it's how you unlock stages, cars, and other unlockables) in just under 5 hours - assuming you're focused solely on completing all the chapters.  There's a lot to do in each chapter, and the first stage in each chapter has three different ways to complete them: kill all opponents, complete all laps, or kill all peds.  There are over 15 vehicles to unlock, plus unlockable skins and rims... so yeah, you'll be busy!  And you'll want to unlock the vehicles - the starter vehicles are awesome (who doesn't like the Eagle?), but some of what you can unlock are downright sick, from a bulldozer to a faux-Delorean!  If you think it's just you and the other crazy drivers on the road, you are wrong: the police are out to stop you at any cost as well.\n\nAll vehicles can be upgraded (weapons, armor, and speed) with upgrade coins that you find scattered amongst the stages, something I'm not the biggest fan of - I'd rather use the credits you rack up on a stage as a source of currency as well.  Granted, they added a way of buying items on-demand now, using the credits you earn when killing peds and drivers (I've only used this ONCE, as I think it makes accomplishing objectives much easier).\n\nLastly, the items.  There are tons of items that can be picked up during a race - some impact the entire stage for a limited time  (Jupiter Gravity!, Pinball Mode), some affect you for a limited time (Instant Handbrakes), and others are usable on-demand a limited number of times (Have a Banana Ray, Ped Vacuum, Earthquake Bomb).  Some items are amazing, others are designed to wreck your life, but it's a healthy mix, and I've enjoyed using all that the game gives you to make the lives of others a living hell!\n\nCONCLUSION\nReincarnation has a fair amount to offer, from the newbie to the Carmageddon veteran.  It's not graphically amazing, but I'd like to think that we all don't only care about graphics - it's all about the gameplay, and Reincarnation delivers what you'd expect from the bloody series.  I hope that we see a legit expansion pack in the future with more stages and vehicles, as one can probably unlock the majority of the game in under 10 hours of gameplay.  Is it worth your money?  At full price, I believe it's worth more than the $60 you'd spend on most AAA games.  If you catch this when on-sale, DEFINITELY pick it up!  If you've ever dreamed of using your car as a weapon of mass destruction, or play a violent driving game that doesn't hold back, you can't do much better than Reincarnation!","September 7, 2015","true","19.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The general goal is to complete all the checkpoints, mow down all the pedestrians, or destroy all of the opposing vehicles.  Outrageous stunts and kills are rewarded appropriately.\n\nC:R is a modern update of the original, and arguably the best, Carmageddon.  All of the vehicles and courses in the C:R were "inspired" by the first game.\n\nBut, like every sequel to the original, C:R falls short of the mark.  The original game revelled in its huge levels and, more importantly, its high speeds.  Carmageddon 1 was just absolutely bonkers and genius.  I can still remember, over a decade later, when I was tearing down a long, long straightaway at insane speeds... only to see a cop car, desperate to get to me, flying 50 feet above me, then smashing into a building.\n\nC:R, on the other hand, feels slow and floaty.  The constrained courses never let you build up a good head of steam for those really silly crashes and stunts, and even at slow speeds vehicles handle more like sluggish hovercraft than cars.  You'll never get into a brawl, only to have someone barrel out of nowhere, plowing through pedestrians the entire time, through the midst of your melee. C:R is just... so slow, and the cars are unfathomably hard to control.  (Note that I'm not talking about frame rate here.  At the time of this writing, C:R was patched for improved frame rate performance, and no longer suffers the crippling lag it did at launch, and should run well on a reasonably-powerful PC).\n\nC:R tries to mix up the formula by adding other race types: checkpoint and pedestrian chases, deathmatch, and a "tag you're it" Fox and Hounds mode.  None of them, IMHO, is as good as the straight-up Death Races of the original Carmageddon.\n\nIn the end, all of the parts that make up Carmageddon are in C:R, except (for me) the most important part -- the ridiculous speed and chaos that tickled me so much, so long ago.  Without that, I unfortunately cannot recommend the game.\n\n","August 28, 2015","false","18.2"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","1"

I had hoped this issue would be down to the fact that it was in beta when I first got it, however, with the full release, it‚Äôs still just the same.\n\nThen, once you‚Äôve waited for it to load, you‚Äôre greeted with a game which, whilst graphically adequate, is logically unappealing; gravity and momentum seem to work completely at random, meaning you‚Äôre forced to guess what your vehicle is going to do when you attempt to change direction or velocity (this doesn‚Äôt appear to affect the computer-controlled opponents making combat frustrating), and damage to the computer-controlled opponents doesn‚Äôt seem to mean anything (cars with only 2 wheels left are faster and more manoeuvrable than your car is).  This means it‚Äôs difficult to race, and impossible to engage in combat effectively, and those, for me at least, are the point of a Carmageddon game.\n\nAs someone who still maintains an old laptop running Windows 98 specifically so I can play old school games, Carmageddon 2 included, I have to point out that I‚Äôm still playing Carmageddon 2 after 16 years, whereas this new version is consigned to my ‚Äòno thanks‚Äô list after less than 16 hours.\n\nVerdict:  Not worthy of the Carmageddon name.","May 25, 2015","false","6.5"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","4"

No, it's THE Carmageddon. The one that's we've been waiting for so long.\nIt's fun, it's brutal, it has lots of cars, tracks, places and powerups. And of course lots of pedestrians to run over.\nIf you ever played the old Carmageddons, this one feels almost exactly the same way. Although it does have several nice additions in comparison to old ones. Including cool repair animation with parts that has fallen off flying back to your car and killing peds on the way. And of course modding support - a very important thing that will undoubtedly keep the game alive for years after release.\n\nOn the downside: the game is poorly optimized. I could barely get consistent 40 fps with everything on lowest settings on my GTX 970. Some people with older GPUs report as little as 4-7 fps.\nSo, if you don't own a powerful PC, or just don't want to play with all the settings on minimum (which does not really look very impressive) - I'd suggest waiting until devs sort out the optimization.\n\nOther than this.

I would reccommend this game to any fans of the old game, and anyone looking for some casual fun. as it stands, as long as you do not crank the detail too high the game plays smooth and feels nice.\nbut it is not finished and I belive in a year or so, they will have done great things.","August 9, 2014","true","6.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

I remember it felt as if I was really bad at it, but it was a lot of fun none the less. The remake really brings back that feeling. This time around I'm old enough to realize I don't suck as bad as I remember, it's just that the cars drive like they're slipping around on ice all the time, and the fun stems from interacting with the weird opponent AI.\n\nIt's complete chaos most of the time, nothing quite responds the way you think it should. But every so often things just come together and you'll wreck some cars and pedestrians in very satisfying ways. Be sure to pick it up if you enjoyed the original.","November 13, 2015","true","14.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fathottopicdiva/recommended/249380/","fathottopicdiva","bobert awful (F+)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fathottopicdiva/","690 products in account","Nostalgia, as I'm pretty sure you're aware of if you've remembered Carmageddon and saw that the developers put out a new game and you waddled over here and went "Oh! New Carmageddon! But is this worth thirty dollars??????????????????????????", is a hell of a drug. Some developers undoubtedly bank on nostalgia to appeal to buyers. And Stainless, in the process of developing Magic games for nerds who don't have enough bank to buy a bunch of booster packs and get angry at fellow neckbeards at the local comic shop's Magic-a-thon Tournament, jumped on this opportunity via Kickstarter!\n\nSo I'm happy to say that Carmageddon: Reincarnation is undoubtedly the best version of Carmageddon released thus far. Unfortunately it is also the most pitch-perfect remake of Carmageddon so far, because it gets every almost every ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing quirk about Carmageddon right. Unfortunately, it also brings in some new quirks.\n\nIf you were dreaming about Carmageddon in HD, you're in absolute luck! Carmageddon looks better than ever. It even plays really well, too! It still has that same amazing ped-mashing anarchic feel. It's just as immature and into weird soundtracks as well (they even licensed the same Fear Factory track from the original 1997 game, in case you forgot what game you were playing). It's a lot of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing fun and this automatically earns my recommendation for being The Best Carmageddon To Play Without Having To ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Around With DosBox.\n\nAs of September 26th, 2015 (at the time of this review), a lot of the game's crashes have been fixed and performance is vastly improved over its May launch. It still takes a little longer than I'd like for it to load what it needs, but it's a major, major improvement over what it used to take.\n\nNow that I'm done drooling over Reincarnation, here's what I'm going to hit it for:\n\n1: I have to play the single player campaign to host things in multiplayer? "Yeah, hold on, I want my friends to share in the awesome Carmageddon action - oh, wait, I have to invest half a day's worth of time into this video game in order to unlock everything and be the life of the party, because the developers said so? Well, I guess I can skip that shower and collect some cockroaches from underneath my couch to serve as dinner fare."\n\n2: It feels like there isn't too much to play with - the single-player campaign has a habit of reusing old battlegrounds, adding to the base level of repetition that plagued Carmageddon's single-player experience. Sure, these battlegrounds are all tied to a much larger map - but I found myself that the levels overlap with each other a little too much. "We're gonna tear through the stadium for the fourth time in Career mode? Okay, I guess? I mean, I like the stadium, but I don't need to see it for the fourth time in a row."\n\n3: The cars feel a little too fragile for Carmageddon, and the best all-around car, by and large, is still Max Damage's Eagle R. It got to the point where I had to put my car back together again only for the same two cars that wrecked it earlier to come back for another round, and getting my racer fix is tooooo expensiiiiive when it's been wrecked for the fourth time in under three minutes. Also the Eagle R is the only car that doesn't handle like ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, like it's always been in Carmageddon.\n\n4: As a matter of fact, while I'm here, it seems like throughout the entirety of the Carmageddon franchise, Max Damage's one standout power is being able to regenerate and stay in the race no matter what happens to him, and it just feels like all the stakes are lowered. Vlad's got his crazy Formula 1 car, Screwie Lewie's got a big drill, Max has immortality. I know who I'm gonna place all of my money on. He's like a grinning tattooed robot Time Lord. This is just nitpicking, but I would love a Sudden Death mode for my character to liven ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up.\n\nAnyway, if you want to play Carmageddon again, this is going to be your best option. The developers did their damndest to make the exact kind of Carmageddon made in 1997, and this is exactly what you're gonna get here!","September 26, 2015","true","7.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I was super stoked to hear about it being 'Reincarnated".\nI am not disappointed, this feels exactly as Carmageddon always has. The tracks are very creative, with plenty of opportunities for air time and all sorts of wacky driving. With the mixture of different pick-ups you get in the game you can easily spend 30+ minutes in a race and not regret a second of it.\n\nI do wish there was slightly more detail on the ground and grass textures, but they did nail the detail in the cars and damage. This does look amazing compared to the original, and plays smooth and well. I do get the occasional stuttering, but very minor and has never been a nuisance.\n\nThe only real disappointment I've had from this game is I can NEVER find an online match. How can nobody play this online?? I was so excited to finally play Carmageddon with real people, I imagine it'd be a blast. If someone on Steam has the game and wants to play, please invite me!\n\nI believe there is a need for Carmageddon in this gaming world 110%. Please give Stainless all your $$ so they can go all out and make a big budgeted, highly polished Carmageddon. As far as destructive racing goes, Carmageddon is and always will be at the top. It's a mixture of FlatOut and Twisted Metal but totally it's own.","January 26","true","33.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Having grown up with Carmageddon 1 and 2, I have a special and rather nostalgic relationship with these games - especially towards C2, which is my favourite of the two. When I first became aware of this "remake" I was of course very skeptical, because how often do these things really turn out great? I was wrong: Stainless has stayed 100% true to the Carmageddon legacy and already at the time of writing (if everything goes as planned) I believe this will be the best Carmageddon game ever. I have recently played the two first games and as much as I love them, the gameplay of Reincarnation is simply more entertaining and involving (I am not considering graphics here). The new power-ups are a big reason for that; for instance you can get a power-up that sucks pedestrians towards your car and one that lets your car spin around quickly destroying any pedestrians in your trajectory to mention some. In other words more imaginative ways to punish peds.\n\nMake no mistake: this is real Carmageddon material made by the same people that gave us the originals using the same philosophy as they did back then. I think they just may have pulled off a very rare feat in the gaming industry, that is making a game in a series that is better than the originals after so many years. Carmageddon: Reincarnation feels like a blend of the best things from C1 and C2 and then some more...\n\nGet it!","July 5, 2014","true","59.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Before I was sitting around 40ish fps with stuttering, and that was at low settings. So, it's come a long way.\n\nIt's a joy to play now, and Stainless should be credited for the improvements.\n\n\nPros:\n\n- Really fun game. There are multiple modes, including multiplayer. The favourite is Classic Carma where you either kill all the pedestrians, wreck all the opponents, or be a boring old sod and race normally.\n\n- Excellent damage model. Parts fly off, wheels fly off, drivers fly off. Repairing causes the parts to fly back to you. You can turn pedestrians into a cloud of blood.\n\n- Tons of power ups that add a dynamic experience to the game, anything from low gravity to being able to blow up pedestrians.\n\n- The classic humour from Stainless.\n\n- Open map design, basically go where you want on the map. You're not confined to a track.\n\n- Load times seemed to be improved too. I put it on an SSD and it cut it to about 12 seconds for a map.\n\n- As said above, optimisation is greatly improved.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- The cars can feel a bit 'floaty' at times, and takes some getting used to. This may be a design choice, seeing as the older Carmageddons feel similar.\n\n- No SLI support, at least not natively (there is probably a workaround). However, with the optimisation improvements, I didn't really find it too much of a problem.\n\n- The graphics could be better, but whether that would kill performance with the damage model I don't know. It's fine for what it is in any case. I believe they improved, but I was playing on low before and near maximum now. They're not terrible by any means, though.\n\n- No PratCam. Not a huge issue, and was only in Carmageddon 1, but it was a nice feature.\n\n\n\nAll in all, they've greatly improved the game since the launch. It's worth buying now, especially at ¬£19.99. The game itself is just fun, doesn't take itself seriously, and is a blast to play. With the open level design, power ups and the nature of the game, each 'race' feels different, which gives the game a good amount of replayability.\n\nSo yes, it's worth buying now.\n\n\n\nMy rig:\n\nI7 4790k @4.5GHz\n16GB 2400mhz DDR3 RAM\nSLi 980GTX (overclocked at that)\nRunning the game off of a 1TB Samsung 850 Pro SSD","February 22","true","11.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

As a 80's kid I was pretty surprised to find a new Carmageddon game.\n\nAfter watching a streamer play for an hour I decided 25 euro might actually be worth the try.\n\nI'm around 40% of the game now and 7 hours of play time, and this is what I have to say.\n\nIs it carmageddon? Hell yeh! But nothing like the old game. This is a race game (laps, checkpoints etc) with a carmageddon flavor. It does not feel like the old game one bit. I enjoyed Carmageddon 1,2 and TDR, but this is just a dissapointment.\n\n- The handling of the cars is rediculous. It feels like you're driving on ice 24/7. Making it impossible to aim for certain objects/points.\n- In the old carmageddon I would never ever finish a race by doing the laps. I would just consider it a destruction derby game and go ham on all the opponents. Here I actually find myself finishing the laps just to be done with it.\nThe main problem is that you do absolutely no damage!? I got level 4 upgrades and when I ram someone it feels like I'm just giving them a little bump (tried multiple cars). On the other side if they hit me, I find myself without wheels, bodywork and basically down to my chassis or wrecked..\n-  As it seems you don't have enough damage to wreck cars by smashing into them, it feels like powerups are the only way to wreck some opponents. Hunting the map for powerups is frustrating and takes away the fun of the game.\n- The maps sometimes are just plainly annoying. Small bridges, water, bumps etc. It's a pain in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• with the handling of the cars. Not to mention the sometimes countless bodies on the ground making it impossible to drive straight. Is that annoying in general? Not really, however when you have to cross a small section and it's littered with bodies + the obnoxious handling of the cars, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• yeh it is.\n\nIt ain't all bad. The game does bring a portion of fun and a smile to your face.\n\n-The new game modes like checkpoint and pedestrian hunting are great fun. I would love to try that with a group of friends.\n- The nostalgia of playing carmageddon.\n\nTo sum it up.\nI would not recommend this game the state it's in now. It lacks the pure carmageddon taste. I think it does have the potential to become one. However if this is the final release, then that does make me sad.\n\nI will finish the game, to make me feel like I didn't waste my money completely and then play C1,2 or TDR since I bought the full pack. For the old fans, wait untill the game drops down to a price range of 10 or less. Then it would have been worth it in the current state of the game.","March 8","false","12.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","2"

The maps look great, there is even 2 arena style destruction debry maps which really caught my eye.\n\n+ The Gory sarcastic carma comedy is there\n\nCons\n\n- No multiplayer yet\n- Ai is very weak  , even on the hardest setting i could win every race no problems, i remember carma being hard.\n- Weapons need tuned and balanced , some seem very overpowered\n- Seem to have infinite money for repairs and respawns\n\nOverall this game has potential , if it gets a balanced multiplayer, an upgraded ai some optimasation and minor bug fixs, it should be good to go. For the price i paid ¬£19.99 it sucks not to have multiplayer and i would rate this product 4/10 in its current state.","December 31, 2014","true","8.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

To be able to use FULL KEYBOARD CONTROLS. I grew up a keyboard jockey in the gaming era of the 1990's starting with games like commander keen, doom, wolf 3d. This runs fantastic even on my core 2 quad /w 8gb ram. BUT, win 8 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•es about being out of memory, so i'm guessing that there are quite a few memory leaks in the game, but being pre-alpha, that is perfectly ok.\n\nAfter actually playing the first map, and unlocking the rest of the game. I feel compelled to add more to my review.\n\nA great deal of sounds are reused, which holds to the carma theme, notably the tire squeals, listen carefully, you will here it. And the checkpoint, i think the same dude was used, sounds the same, but older.\n\nI focused on playing Beef Curtains, and i noticed A LOT of things, both new and old. The park map, is the same one used in Carma 1, the old track is now dirt, the loop is still there, so is the jump from hell, the coastal track is still asphalt. My point is this, they took the old map, UPDATED IT, like time had passed froom Carma 1 to the new game. Playing it is a whole new map, but i found nods to the old map there. I believe the other maps may be the same way, with new maps.\n\nThings i've noticed about how detailed this game is now, and how i hope it will be once done.\n\nEngines:  if you take their hood off, you can see the engine torquing as it would in a normal car, even changes RPM same way.\n\nCar Parts: You can rip entire axles off cars, you can even rip cars in two with the plow, which has a back up beeper, Nice Touch!\n\nDrivers: You can now kill the driver independantly of the car. I have knocked Stella out of her car, and run her over, which got me the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• announcement\n\nThe cows: they go moo, like a dude is voicing the moo, groovy peds makes the cows dance,  and you can now carry peds a distance before killing them, which makes for some creative ways to kill people.\n\nI do like all the nods to all 3 previous carma games, the inclusion of power ups from all 3 of them, and the people hopping around on one leg, from TDR 2000.\n\nA couple of gripes however:\n\nMotion Blur : Seems it would tax even the most advanced of graphics boards, can be turned off, so not a real gripe, but interesting nonetheless\nKeyboard Assignment : We cannot change keys as of yet, something to implement for the future\nPrat Cam : Please give us back the Prat Cam. Nothing is more gratifying than to see Max Damage hit a person with the roof of his car while he is saying "Mommy!"\n\nThe main problem with this pre-alpha is memory consumption, i get windows is out of memory twice an hour. and that is a clean boot right into the game, with 8GB ram.\n\nMy current build is as follows\n\nAsus P5N-D Mobo\nIntel Core 2 Quad @ 2.8 Ghz\n8gb DDR-2 Dual Channel ram\n3 TB Seagate Hdd\n1.44mb Floppy Drive *YES I STILL USE ONE, EAT ME*\n1 Kilowatt PSU\nWindows 8.1 x64 Pro /w Media Addition\n\nUpdate:\nI can get almost 20FPS now in smaller areas, on this older hardware. To all of you ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing about FPS, i don't know what your problems are, but if i can get that out of 6 year old hardware, with the code very much unoptimized, unreliable, and unstable, you should be able to EASILY get at least 30FPS..\nGame runs about 8-15 FPS, still very much playable, but i implore the devs, if they read this, to allow the game to run on lower specced systems, with complete control of graphics settings and abilities.\n\nGood Job so far, WELL WORTH THE SUPPORT!!","December 30, 2014","true","34.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The Beta release is a massive step-up from the Pre-alpha. It's got the feel of the old games, with physics that would almost be at home in a proper racing game. Crash damage is excellent, and while the peds are far from GTA quality, they do seem a lot better than in the pre-alpha.\n\nOne thing that made Carmageddon 1 and 2 so great was the thought that went into the designs of both the tracks and cars. Thankfully Reincarnation is no different! All the cars are highly detailed, both the remakes and new designs, and each has it's own wacky design features. As for the tracks, you can spend hours simply exploring them. Most of the maps are large, with tons of hidden areas. The remakes of some popular Carmageddon 1 locations create a sense of nostalgia, but achieve it without looking old and outdated.\n\nThe only real criticism is the game performance, an issue that the developers are well aware of and are trying their hardest to fix. I found it considerably better than the pre-alpha, although it has some way to go. Loading times are long, and there were a few framerate drops, most notably at the start of a race. The coastal level also had a tendency to crash my video card drivers until I turned the graphic quality down. The majority of the time, it ran fairly smoothly though. As long as you have a decent system, it's certainly a very playable and enjoyable game. Considering it also includes the previous games in the series, it's good value for money too. I highly recommend this game.","February 20, 2015","true","80.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I barely can, and I'm running on an i7something and a GTX670whatever. I wouldn't really have a problem with turning some settings down if the game looked better.\n\nHonestly, the dated looking graphics don't really bother me at all. I'll happily play old games with old graphics, and new games with dated graphics, but when a game looks 8 years old, and plays like a game from 8 years in the future, you've got a problem. I strongly suggest looking into whether you'll be able to achieve a decent FPS, or waiting until maybe some optimisation happens. I'm concerned that it won't though because honestly, it feels a bit like the game was released because they ran out of resources and time rather than actually finished it.\n\nFortunately, turning the graphics down a bit results in 50-60fps for me, so I can actually play the game without a struggle. Once that happens, it's great fun. There's a lot of fun things to do, lots going on, and it feels just like classic Carmageddon games. The new modes are nice, though the AI doesn't really know too well how to best reach some objectives, for example a target ped on a rooftop.\n\nOverall, I recommend the game, but unfortunately I can only base that on gameplay alone.\n\nPlease please optimise this game better.

It was first Kickstarted back in 2012, then landed on Steam Early Access, and is now available for the official final release.  But was it worth the long wait and is this reboot better than the original?  Let's take a look at Carmageddon Reincarnation in this First Impression review.\n\nCarmageddon is known for car combat and unrelenting violence.  It was one of the original games that gave you points for arbitrarily running over pedestrians and crashing into your opponents.  Reincarnation has several different modes but they are all basically variations on racing to checkpoints while simultaneously running over pedestrians and bashing your opponents.  Doing these two tasks plus running overall barrels provides you with credits that you use to purchase weapons and repair your vehicle.  There's three ways to win: finish the race first, wreck your opponents vehicles, or kill all the peds.\n\nThe game is basically just mayhem and twisted fun.  If you're expecting a straight racer, you're in the wrong place.  You'll find enemies driving in the wrong direction just to run you over.  Racing freely around the map without feeling like you have to play seriously can be a lot of fun.  I find myself getting lost in demolition derby type moments with other cars.  And then straying off course when I want to mow down a big batch of pedestrians.\n\nThe weapons are ridiculous.  Some of them will make pedestrians fly into the air or start dancing arbitrarily.  Then you have weapons that will launch your opponents or leave mines on the course for them.  Another cool feature is the damage model.  It's incredibly detailed and it's amazing to watch your car start fraying and fall apart and then come back together again as you hit repair.  The soundtrack is also pounding heavy metal that's 100 percent suitable for this action.\n\nThose are the fun parts of Carmageddon, but let's talk about the negatives.  The performance of the game is really bad.  Initially I thought it was possibly the settings or too much multitasking on my computer, but it wasn't.  A lot of other people are complaining that they cannot hit 60 frames per second even after reducing the graphics settings.  I can run Dying Light and Shadows Of Mordor on Ultra at 60fps, but my computer struggles to hit 60 fps on medium quality in this game.  And I had some serious stuttering issues where the entire game would just pause for a second or two.  The devs have stated that the poor performance is due to the high amount of physics rendering and they are working on improvements, but this doesn't seem playable for people who are on mid range or budget gaming computers.\n\nAs far as the gameplay, it honestly seems outdated.  I want to like Carmageddon Reincarnation, but it doesn't bring anything new.  The gameplay and the levels feel like they are held too closely to the original without modernizing the action.  Racing and combat can have dull points where it seems like you just can't make the car perform the way you want it to.  Cars have a floaty feel where you will miss hitting peds and cars due to the fact that the steering lacks proper handling.  These flaws kill the fun in this otherwise cool game.  While the graphics of the car models look excellent, the models of the Peds and of the environment are lacking.\n\nMy opinion on Carmageddon is mixed.  As much as I like the idea of classic 90s style vehicle violence, I don't think it was executed well.  Actually playing the game lacks the intensity I saw in the trailers and that I anticipated for this reboot.  If you don't have a high end gaming rig, you may want to hold off until the performance issues are fixed.   Save this game for the die hard Carmageddon fans.\n\nPositives:\nClassic Car Combat And Killing\nRockin Heavy Metal Soundtrack\nGreat Destruction Model\n\nNegatives:\nPerformance Issues\nOutdated graphics\nFloaty Physics\nOutdated Gameplay","May 24, 2015","true","4.4"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

Though I disliked Carma 2. I was Rush 2 with driving over people, or not you could just as easily be a goody goody who stuck to the race track or punished those AWEFUL death racers.\n\nThe carmageddon genre of games have ALWAYS given, the players who play them, FREEDOM. After all that is what we're paying for; that is why GTA does so well, sometimes you just want to do things you can not. GTA had shooting a hooker after she 'does' you in a car you've stolen, and Carmageddon; puts you inside of, one of many, sweet ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• cars, and lets you drive that car AS YOU WISH.\n\nInto people, off of cliffs, through obsticles, 1000 feet into the air, ALL at 200MPH, and with this new generation of damage modeling, come crashing down into a shattered husk of former glory, and watch while the pieces snap back into position with the press of a button, and some hard earned credits, without so much as you having to pick up a wrench.\n\nI could go on for hours about this, the fourth installment, of Carmageddon, but I don't have to. This game is THE representation of a company giving they're customers what they want, and I do not need to romance it. If you have only ever played mainstream, also-on-console, new-version-same-as-the-last-on-but-with-shinier-menus, drivle, this game will introduce you to wanting more from the people you give your money too.","June 5, 2014","true","24.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(seriously, has anyone ever won this way except just to be a completist?)\n\nA request to Stainless: Please (pleaseplease) don't give in to any temptation to add suck to this as we move towards final release!  The fun is in the chaos and the carnage.  If we wanted missions (C2 & TDR2K) and arbitrarily low max time limits (TDR2K) we would have bought a different racing game.

Key features like Pinball mode, used to be huge CPU eaters (rightfully so), but not anymore! Each event in Single Player runs pretty smooth!\nBy the way\nhere's my performance report :\n\nGame runs good on 1080p Medium Settings on a 2012 PC. i5-3470 , 8GB RAM , GTX 750Ti, Samsung SSD 120GB. "Runs great" means 40-70 FPS on all times. And it is great since anything above 35FPS is enjoyable. 25-35 FPS is playable. Minor FPS drops only in Multiplayer. Single Player is great!\n\nI played the newest build (Gold Version) for a few hours and here's what i have to say for the v.1.0 and the game in general\n\nPros\n-Awesome sandbox maps and gameplay full of unexpected outcomes.\n-One of the most detailed crushing code/physics i've ever seen in a car/driving game\n-Great car models! Each car is unique with it's own parts (moving or not) and drives differently.\n-Sounds and animations are hilariously stupid! Cow sounds for example always give me a good chuckle.\n-Enemy car AI has improved A LOT since Alpha! I was amazed at the preciseness of the whole thing. If i'm allowed to post videos in reviews to showcase this, i will.\n-The performance is good and smooth now on a 2012 PC rig.\n\nCons\n-Although i never go went lower than 30FPS on 1080p mostly on medium settings, and the range is 30-70 FPS, the game could still be optimized a bit more.\n-One map feels visually empty (Icy Oil Rig).\n-Receiving and giving damage on Hard Difficulty is insane. That might or might not be a case with you (may other people found it pretty easy), but i was getting wrecked all the time and the damage i dealt to others was not satisfactory. On lower difficulty modes it's much better.\n\nOverall this game has the best combination of physics, fun and gameplay from all the latest driving games. Should you like Car Mayhem games i recommend this.\nIf you're a fan of the first Carmageddon games i can't even describe how much you'll love this game.\n\nINITIAL REVIEW :\nSo far (April 5th 2014), it's a good game in it's Alpha State  (Pre-Alpha v0.1.3.4668 - yes it's version ZERO). It feels like Carmageddon, yet it has a bunch of new PowerUps and general additions to the first two games.\n\nWhen this game gets fully textured maps and cars, few more of them in quantity and Multiplayer, well...it's gonna be great!\n\nI'll have to upgrade my GPU soon for this gem!","April 4, 2014","true","116.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Being in Pre-Alpha early access means it's quite limited now, but tickles every bone in my nostalgia sensors and does it with style.  I've been waiting for this game for many years and have enjoyed the others that came before it especially 2 and TDR 2000. If you love racing games that offer you more than just laps around a liniar track, giving you powerful and sometimes crazy powerups, running over countless people and animals and blowing up the competition, look no further. Long as i've had to wait, while it's not perfect it's everything i've hoped it would be in this stage of it's development.\n9/10\n\nEDIT:\nNow that the "public beta" is out and it's practically a full game i can safely say that my opinion has not faultered but grown. Load times have improved across the board (no longer takes excess of 5 minutes to load the big city map) New modes and career are a blast if a bit same-y Still a few bugs and unexpected situations here and there but it's nothing to hinder performance. Each vehicle has a unique personality that reflects that of their driver, their weapons behave as they should.\n\nMy childhood squeels with glee whenever i play a new round. Everything i'd hoped it would be and i hope more comes soon.\n\nOne final note, unless you have the patience of a brain surgeon, DO NOT drive Vlad's Anniolator.

The original Carmageddon came during the era of Doom and Mortal Kombat, when ultra violence and excessive blood in a game was the norm.  It came during the big 3D Card boom of the late 90's.  It was different from every other racing game out there.  Set in a sort of Deathrace 2000 future where violent criminals raced for cash on live TV and ran over any pedestrian that got in their way.\n\nThe original game has been a long time favorite of mine, as well as it's sequel.  Everything about this game is perfect and it's so far only in pre-alpha.  That should say a lot considering what a fan I am of the originals.  I was ready to be overly critical of this sequel but Stainless has gone right back to their roots with this game and it shows.  Currently only in Pre-Alpha, theres only access to 3 tracks and 6 cars.  But the original Carmageddon experience is still in tact with what is there.  Race to win, Kill to win, Destroy to win.  Win however you want to.  It's a free form racing game at it's finest.  By the time they add multiplayer, modding, and bump up the number of vehicles to 30 like the original (And they plan to) this game will be a solid game.  I love it now, but can't wait till it is finished.","April 6, 2014","true","94.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Starting in 1997, it had two fantastic games and one hell of a flop which would delay it's return until today. The developer team is made up of hard core fans; where with Spyro they rebooted just for money and fame and it turned out to be horrible, Carmageddon is a game that has come from and developed it's roots.\n\nSo, understandably, classic gameplay is present. You have three goals; kill all the enemy players, kill all the pedestrians/cows/penguins or complete all the laps. It's really that simple. This can result in some hilarious gameplay (as seen in the video above and others on that channel) where pedestrians will splatter and the AI enemies will do ridiculous things to get in your way. All this while frantically getting through checkpoints results in complete madness and hilarity.\n\nConcerning content and price, it's pretty much a personal opinion. You have to remember that when you buy this game, more will be added up until release late 2014. If you go on their site, you can have a look at all the cars they plan to include and there are several more concepts in the works along with planned DLC packs. The price of this game WILL go up around 30%, so it can be seen as an investment. As of 27/03/2014, you get six cars and four levels.\n\nOne of the game's key mechanics is the damage effects. It is similar to those of Next Car Game's; smash into something or someone and dents will appear with chunks flying off your vehicle. Wheels can be lost and tyres will even pop when put under too much strain, and on rare occurences your driver can be flung from their windscreen. All this, with a regenerative repair button which sucks your lost parts back from the terrain to your car. It is a pretty awesome feature that can only be seen to be truley appreciated.\n\nMultiplayer will be one of the next things to arrive. Calm your horses.\n\nSo yes, I would recommend this game. But only if you have intentions of playing it in it's full release, otherwise it's a waste of money. Go get it. You know you want to.","April 11, 2014","true","8.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The devs are very active on their forums at carmageddon.com and stream on Twitch for 2 hours every wednesday where they answer questions, respond to feedback and chat with the community on camera.\n\nThere is new content added all the time and it's incredibly open to modding with users already creating and releasing mods on the forums and expansive modding tools to be released. Steam Workshop support will be added for easy installation of mods.\n\nIt is in pre-alpha right now, so it is not optimized for performance yet but improves with every update. There is already a good amount of content, with the first version of multiplayer to be released next week. In addition to a lot of cars and levels that are already in, modded levels and cars from the first game ported by the community are also available.\n\nIt is an excellent throwback to Carmageddon 1 and 2 with amazing attention to detail and love and care put into it. The way the devs interact with the community every day is awesome.\n\nLocal Splitscreen is planned, just like online and local multiplayer.\n\nGraphics, content and performance are nowhere near final, so if you can live with that I can't recommend it enough.

Carmageddon is an open-sandbox style racer in the 90's controversial for it's over the top vehicular violence in which that it allows you to race through vast landscapes, demolish and crush other racers and smear the pedestrians by running over them watching their guts smeared on the pavement, grass and sidewalks. Lovely!\n\nCarmageddon Reincarnation plays similarly to it's predecessors with the same amount of 'weight' to the cars being heavy and impactful on crashes but it retains it great sense of speed one of it's weaknesses remains from the inability to control the car. The game still does not focus on actual racing unless you play multiplayer.\n\nIt also has a great selection of cars that you can use to smash up and crush cars and power ups to fling them high into the air or turn them into tin cans!\n\nGraphically the game features a detailed damage model governed by soft-body physics, making crashs a ton of fun to do and making you go out stylishly. Suffers mild FPS drops and maybe the old stutter at times if lots of cars are crashing.\n\nMost of the problems however were solved with a recent patch and even offers multiplayer which is great. The career mode is challenging and a tad grindy but offers multiple locales and some oldies from the first game.\n\nOh! And they give you the previous Carmageddons, FOR FREE or for cheap as chips (less than 10 quid at most) (if you purchased during the alpha-access), so theres no reason not to buy this and run over some grannies!","September 24, 2015","true","4.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Yes, it is a beta version, there are going to be some problems. If you are a fan of the game series, it would be worth it just to be able to say that ‚ÄúYou were there.‚Äù True fans do not mind sitting on the bleeding edge. Deal with it, and try to have fun.\n\nThe game is still the same as before: high powered, obnoxious, as politically uncorrect as Jeremy Clarkson and Craig Charles after a few beers and some rather harsh words about each other's auntie. The music is still as wild as before, though much of it is dubstep. Though this is kind of hard to avoid now a days since the future is nothing but dubstep.\n\nGame play: We still run over pedestrians, and slam other cars into walls or off ledges, etc. But one of the rather subtle changes that I noticed after a while is that it is a lot harder being a psychopath than one would think. There is more to it than getting all of the voices in your head to scream the same thing in chorus. Running over pedestrians is now much more work; sometimes it takes a couple of passes to kill one properly. Not to mention now it is near impossible to drive in a straight line over a corpse littered street without some limb or torso causing you to drift off to one side or the other. And after a few obese pedestrians flying over your hood, you will begin to question if perhaps you should go run a few more laps on a regular basis just in case you wind up on the other end of the chrome grille. As with previous generations of the game, the physics engine does a pretty good job of being fairly realistic, considering that we are driving around in a rather anti-social manner.\n\nGraphics: I think that this is where this game really shines. The graphics are a major improvement over the older games where you had to train yourself to recognize which distant pixel you should aim for before you get near it, or what really that polygon is supposed to represent. The buildings are highly detailed, objects behave like they are actual objects. Several places I had to stop the car to see some of the jokes that were purposefully inserted into the game, and there are a lot of them.\nBut for the long time fan, you will also notice that a lot of the maps are more than just mere re-imagings of older layouts.\n\nBugs: Haven't seen anything unusual that would not be seen in any other game. Some prims still clip each other. And some game sprites make you wonder if they were fed nothing but raw meat, hate, and lead paint chips judging by their antics. One race I watched for five minutes straight Rusk jumping a ramp, crashing, recovering, and starting over at the same place on the ramp repeatedly before I decided that I needed the points more than being entertained.","February 15, 2015","true","41.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This is a racing game where exploring with a car comes to it's rights. This is a racing game where it actually pays to crash someone else to steal their laps. This is Carmageddon: Re√Øncarnation.\n\nOf course the ones who do know the word Carmageddon do immediatly think of running over people, which still counts here. The big difference between the earlier versions and this one is: the first Carma was very controversial with running over old people and made it very graphical. This one is still... graphical. But it is not the focus this time. This time it's simple and utter fun with vehicular chaos.\n\nRunning over peds* is still magnificent, don't get me wrong here, but the game truly comes in it's right when you play multiplayer (no peds included). Admitted some work still needs to be done but as soon as you get a full room, laughter (or irritation) is guaranteed!\n\nStainless did release this game a little to soon and surely it got quite the negative reviews when it was released because of the poor optimization but they are still working on it. In fact load times aren't tedious long anymore and framerates dramatically improved since its release date (different per pc configuration of course).\n\nWhat is good about this game then you ask?\n\nWell, open world racing not to be taken to serious is one thing for starters.\nCar designs I still find very good; from the slow and deadly to the fast and dead one's and everything in between. Damage systems are very fun!\nGraphics some people do find bad but Stainless did work with the tools they got/created; nothing seems out of place (check some older games with "graphic enhancements" and you'll know what I mean).\n\nAnd what about the bad things?\n\nIt could use a little more maps (but that's just me whining).\nOptimization here and there (as stated above it is being worked on still).\nThe way multiplayer lobbies work definetly still needs some work although in-game multi nothing is wrong.\n\nWould I recommend it? It is a game and games are created for your entertainment. Well it surely entertained me! And we need more online players!\nI od undestand some hesitation when you see 'unoptimized' bu then at least give it a chance when it is on sale!\n\n*Peds are very human like and live in secluded settlements away from humans. Some researchers mistakenly named them pedestrians when first discovered and finally shortened for peds. These "people" have in fact less brains then the average human and burst quite easily (very fun!). More researchers are required to see how these peds react to being hit by cars.\nAlso: researchers are being pit against eachother without the meddling of these petty creatures to show who is the best researcher!","January 9","true","56.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

Smashing opponents' cars as well as dismembering peds is enormously enjoyable. Vehicles damage is modeled quite in detail and you may create some really interesting kinked and twisted sculptures of of your opponents' cars (and they, and the police especially can do the same with yours). Big variety of powerups (some really annoying though), greatly improved and interesting locations are another advantages of this title. New gameplay modes are playable but they don't deliver much fun (except Car Crusher and maybe Death Race). Current version runs smooth, crashes are occasional but they happen unfortunately. Hope there will be DLCs with Splatpack or Carmageddon II cars and some new locations.\nAll in all I give new Carmageddon 8 out of 10 and a recomendation.","January 11","true","32.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

I have a Geforce 970, i5 2500k and 8 gigs of Ram and the game runs flawlessly; however it has long load times for levels (and even after a level, when it's loading menus), and I have an SSD so that's pretty odd.\n\nThe game itself is almost exactly like the original Carmegeddon, basically a destruction derby race in the middle of crowded cities where you get points for running over pedestrians.  So that's fun.  The AI could use some tuning; particularly in later levels, opponents (particularly the police cars) seem to focus on you to the exclusion of others , which can make for a frustrating experience.  Add in that at least the early cars you have access to seem underpowered compared to the AI, in that they seem capable of pushing you around and into walls with impunity while if you try to do the same to them, they will apply their brakes until you come to a halt, or they peel themselves away from your bumper.\n\nSo, the game isn't quite the cathartic experience I would prefer.  Instead after the first few levels it becomes important to go around picking up power-ups (particularly, the opponent repulsificator, and the anvil launcher) to do in your enemies without having to spam the recover button.  It becomes more tactical, which I suppose is a good thing.\n\nStill, I had fun with the game.  The developers are active so hopefully they will continue to tweak the gameplay.  If your the type of person who likes to murder people with automobiles you should pick it up.","January 10","true","9.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

I know a lot of people complain about the car handling, but from someone who has played Carmageddon since the originals, I know the handling has never been perfect. My only complaint right now is there seem to be too many ray type weapons over weapons that do awesome physical damage.\n\nI also read about people having problems with frame rates and game not running well. I have never had issues with my computer. My graphics card is a GTX 970 and this game runs smooth no matter what I am doing.\n\nIf you are looking into this game and love the old Carmageddon's, I would recommend it. If you are tired of regular racing games and want some crazy action, I would recommend this. If your style of racing is Gran Tourismo and F1 Racing, give this a try still. :) And with Steam's easy refund policy, if it isn't your thing, there you go.","January 19","true","10.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I reluctantly held off all the way through the Kickstarter campaign and early access, fearing it may lead to complacency and indeed the 'FINAL' update sounded pretty disappointing even though it was obvious that there was a good game underneath.

Perhaps upgrades will help, but even then I dont think there is an incentive to upgrade any car until you get either your favorite one or the Electric Blue.\n\n-Taking hits from opponent AI gets you terribly disfigured, disabled, or killed. While giving hits barely gets you that satisfying crunch of wasting your opponent with a well aimed ram. I was unable to destroy an AI racer while it was sitting helpless on its top, after 3 60mph hits, I gave up and moved on.\n\n-Hitting mines from the map = 95% chance for death.\n\n-Slowly hitting peds only knocks them around instead of killing them. They should just die from just touching them no matter how fast you're going. Many times, I was going fast enough to kill myself and have peds bounce off. "It's a flesh wound!"\n\n-Where is the workshop? Boasting of custom cars in the alpha stage, now nowhere to be seen. Would've loved to drive in many fun cars like the batmobile, bigfoot, ecto1 hearse, and many others.\n\n-Control schemes for the xbox controller is limited to 3 presets without a way of changing them to a much beter scheme.\n\n-I HATE when my car swerves and wobbles from side to side. (this is a personal one, perhaps because I don't know how to handle the vehicle to prevent this sort of game stopping manuver.)\n\n-AI seem to be able to move so quickly that they are on you in two seconds after you have stuffed them into a corner.\n\n-Prat cam missing. I would'nt have minded the reuse of the old prat cam footage as a place holder for when the real one comes in.\n\n- Moving around the stage select screen is a disaster. Why not move and highlight with a cursor or joystick? forced using keyboard to move and trigger and bumper buttons for the xbox controller.\n\nWhat I liked about the CR:\n\n-The racers look good. Though textures can be extremely muddy. Perhaps this may be because I turn them down to the lowest setting in hopes of lowering load times.\n\n-Level designs are decent. Varied in locations and styles. Though, there are no night / dark stages. Each one is saturated in light, well lit.\n\n-"Wrecked 'em!" funny at first, but got old fast, as for it was the only line you would hear.\n\n-Game seems to run fine with me. I would get a freeze that would last 2-3 seconds before it would go back to normal. Not sure what that is all about.\n\n- Music is fun and it gets you in the mood to cause havoc.\n\n-PUPs are very fun and kool to use. I like the new ones. Using Pelvic Thrust will not net you killls, sadly....\n\n- Customizing the cars you have earned is a nice addition! Extremely basic at best. Just the chance to color cars in one preset shade at a time.\n\n- Enjoyed the stealable feature. Gives you an incentive to gun for a specific car. Starting out, increasing your roster is a must and fun! You're mine now!\n\nThat's all I can think of for now.\n\nTL;DR\n\nFinally: This game has huge potential. It was not ready to be released because it was in the same condition before and after release. People pay for the final product and not half the product in hopes the game will be finished to your promises. All of us wait in vain for the things we are waiting for, too often, even with huge companies with tons of money to throw around. Too late, the developers have our money. Let's pray that the developers provide the customers with what they paid for. I wouldn't have minded waiting till it was ready....\n\nI recommend playing the game when it is perfect. It's a fun chaotic game. Currently I do not recommend this game because we did not recieve what we were waiting for, and that it still has many problems that need fixing. It's not ready.","June 24, 2015","false","12.2"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","4"

The game runs fine now, and nobody seems to update their reviews.\n\nIt's the newest Carmageddon game, and it's great. Developed by the same group that did the first two, not by the same guys that did the dreadful TDR 2000. If you enjoyed either of the two originals, you will love this one, but if you hated them, this will not change your mind.  It has a "feel" more  like the original than 2, retains the better powerups of the second, but is a much, much, better game than Carmageddon 2 was. The cars all handle like crap, more like heavy hovercars than what they should. That isn't a complaint though, because while handling it awful, it's true to the classic games. The damage model is excellent, albeit seems kinda touchy. The cars feel like they are all made of toilet paper, and sometimes a light tap into a wall is enough to crumple your vehicle. Tires will go flat, wheels fall off, paint is scratched, blood will cover your car, and your driver can actually be ejected from the car, and high impacts can even completely flatten it. I haven't been able to split it like you could in Carma 2, but the site implies you can.\n\nI can't really complain about the new modes, some people are ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•y, but I them extremely entertaining. "Death Race" has you racing like a normal racing game, but you can wreck opponents to steal points. In  "Ped chase" A random Pedestrian will be highlighted and everyone goes nuts trying to be the first to hit kill them. Wrecking opponents steals a point! "Checkpoint Stampede" spawns a checkpoint on the map, race through it to get a point. Again, wrecking an opponent will steal you a point. There are more modes, too, but I haven't got to them yet.\n\nI absolutely love it so far, and I'm sure that when you hit the "Groovin' Peds" powerup and see the football teams in formation, jammin' out to a funky beat you will love it too... as you proceed to vacuum their legs off and splatter their body parts everywhere. If real football were like that, I might actually watch it.","February 4","true","13.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","2"

If you are for some reason waiting to see if it's worthy of the Carma name, it is. It's a great Carmageddon game. If you are new to the series, then maybe you don't know what Carmageddon is all about. You are placed in a large open map with other cars, and you want to be the first to either wreck everybody, finish all the checkpoints (and all laps), or kill all the pedestrians (a goal that is hard to do, but a badge of honor to do it). In classic single player Carma, you need to satisfy one of these objectives before time runs out. Time can be increased by causing chaos like killing people or hitting other cars. While you can race, this isn't really a racing game. It's hard to really say what it is. Watch some gameplay and see. There's lots of neat powerups, and maps and cars. The game also has a very silly, if not crude at times, sense of humor. I wouldn't recommend it to people who just want a straight racing game, but for people who just want car chaos, I would go for it, there's tons of that, and the cool damage system means that there will be parts flying everywhere.\n\nThe only con is that there are still a little bit of technical problems, mostly optimization stuff, but if you're getting this a while after it is out, that should all be hammered out.","May 21, 2015","true","6.8"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","13","24","2","0"

I'm not sure if they had to cut out some graphical features or not, but what i can tell is that the game runs just fine at max settings now. During previous builds you were lucky to get a decent framerate with half settings, that is no longer an issue! So if you were worried about performance before, I say the game feels just fine now and I'm running a first gen unlocked Intel i5 at max overclock speed.

I had meant to come back when the full game releases and give my impressions of it. I was surprised to discover that I completely missed this game leaving Early Access.\n\nDo I still recommend it? Yes. Is it awesome? ... kinda. But it certainly is Carmageddon, and those searching for a nostalgic foray into car smashing and pedestrian killing shouldn't be disappointed.\n\nThis game did suffer some performance issues in early access, and judging from reviews it took a while for them to fix it. Some would probably say for the level of fidelity Carmageddon overtaxes their computers. This game performs slightly better than Arkham Knight for me, but with significantly less visual pizzazz.\n\nThe gameplay is spot-on for a Carmageddon game, though the cars feel a little sluggish at times. The healing mechanic feels a bit overpowered, and I would have liked to see the ability to heal yourself replaced with health powerups scattered throughout the level. The AI doesn't seem to heal themselves, so they have a massive disadvantage in some game modes.\n\nDespite my criticism I feel like this game is worth the asking price and I absolutely enjoyed the time I spent in it.","April 3, 2014","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is just too poorly optimized.  The devs said their goal was to get their engine up to 30fps... I don't think this is an acceptable bar for 2015.  The devs did say they will now try to work it up to the 60fps bar as they weren't aware 30 fps was a bad goal to aim for for release.  If that does happen I will gladly change my review but in its current state there is no way I could recommend the game to friends.\n\nThe gameplay is extremely fun and does represent the old Carmageddon in a good way, but the poor optimization is what is really holding this one back and kills the game.  I have a decent system(i7 2600K stable oced to 4.4ghz, 2Xr9 270x in crossfire, 16gb of ram) and struggle to get a stable 30fps.

If you restart a race it takes ages to load again.\n\nI am pretty sure the sound affects are taken right out of Carmageddon TDR 2000, especially the car engine sounds, which are poor quality and give me a headache.

So you can forget about killilg all the peds because that will probably never happen.\n\nYou can not modify the controls for the gamepad apart from 3 templates which all suck. The right stick controls the camera, but you can only look where they want you too, so you cannot look behind you.\n\nThe most anoying thing about the game is how fragile the cars are. In carma 1 the cars were alot stronger and it took a while to kill a AI but the players cars were stronger too but now the AI can hit the player once and your wasted. after you get wasted you can repair and keep driving which feels like i am cheating because the AI can't do it, so why can i? by the end of most races i end up with negitive credits, and it does not even seem to matter.\n\nCarmageddon 1,2 and 3 are far better then this version.\nA few months ago i played carma1 and i could not put it down until i finnished it but i get bored with this one before the first race is over.","October 23, 2014","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

They've re-done many of the old tracks and are remaking all the old cars before they go on to make new ones it would seem. If you've played the first Carma you will recognize the tracks almost immediately and begin to explore just like you did the first time. The physics and damage are superb, as is the sound track and sound FX. If you ever liked Carma, you will not be dissappointed!

BUT after some updates this game runs as you would expect and it's Carmageddon allright!\n\nPro's:\n- Fitting soundtrack (actually: a fantastic soundtrack, both for metalheads and techno lovers)\n- Eagle and Hawk are well designed\n- A lot of cars from previous series (Stig-o-sore, Screwie-lewie)\n- A lot of powerups from previous series, some of them with visual effects as well (Bouncy bouncy,\n- Some powerups change the look of your car (ie: Solid granite car)\n- Levels of cops: the enforcer to fear, the mini-cop cars to smash.\n- Cool repair effect: the parts of your car fly back together\n- You win cars pretty fast, you don't have to be super-lucky like in carma1\n- Perfect controller support\n\nnew pro's after the update:\n- While a bit more demanding than previous carmageddon versions, the physics are now enjoyable.\n- Most of the cars look good\n- The load times are a bit longish but nothing too bad (not Fallout 4 alike)\n- The damage model is wonderfull\n- Weapons on cars actually work, you can slice people with your eagle hawk, or pop tires with Val Hella's cleaver\n\nCon's:\n- I miss the prat cam :(\n- While the tracks are OK, you drive around on them way too often\n- Checkpoint stampede and kill the specific pedestrian are virtually the same game mode\n- New enemies aren't interesting, but the old ones are very good\n\nWhile it might not be THE installment every carmageddon fan wished for it's definatly a good one. I'm hoping for a sequel with refreshing new cars and tracks, an equally good soundtrack and a bleeping prat cam!","March 15, 2015","true","23.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OverheadV8/recommended/249380/","OverheadV8","Hammy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OverheadV8/","106 products in account","(DISCLAIMER - This review may change if some of the main issues are being addressed and actually worked on.) Original review posted on 22 May, 2015. Updated 18 May, 2016\n\nUPDATED!\n\nFirst of all I want to thank the developer, Tracy for making me revisit the game after their recent major update. It took me a while, but I'm a man of my word. I just re-revisited it (at the time I'm writing this update I'm enjoying Reincarnation a lot and will push it through all chapters!), and I can happily say the game is now way, way, waaay better. My main issue when I made this review was with performance. My rant list was consisted of other things as well, but since then a lot has been greatly improved. Sure I can't say I still like everything, but damn, it's starting to feel like a real game now. They really improved the performance significantly. It plays excellent now! It's stable, less buggy, it sounds more crisp...It's..It's... It's ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•in' CARMAGEDDON! Let's leave it to that!\n\nA big thank you to Stainless Games for keeping their word and not betraying their loyal fans and backers!\n\nMy old rants can still be found down there for all to read. I still miss something from the original, but all in all Reincarnation ain't that bad of a game after all! My old negative review just turned into a positive one!\n\n\nAs a hardcore and truly loyal fan of the original Carmageddon (the first game in the series 1997. Note: I'm gonna refer back to it a lot) I have to say that Reincarnation is an insult to the first game, and literally a middle finger salute for all loyal backers who believed in this game (including myself). I don't expect to have a copy of the original, but all that hype Reincarnation had and it was supposed to deliver failed (at least for now). Stainless made their cash and we all got suckered, you know how it goes nowadays. Seriously though, releasing a game in a state Reincarnation is now is almost criminal.\n\nIf looking back at the early access development, I must say it hasn't gotten much better. I feel like this game is still early access / early alpha. It took Stainless Games over a year before they made it to full "final version" as they like to call it now. All I see now is the content being more complete among with some bugs and crash issues being fixed which is a good thing of course, but the biggest problem, the performance remains and is still a major issue. Even when running this hog with an ASUS ROG it is simply not possible to enjoy this game the way you should be. Despite the atrocious performance, I want to release some steams now and tell you about some other things wrong with this product.\n\n\nCARMAGEDDON WORLD\n\nBasically my biggest issue with this game is the actual feel. It doesn't feel like Carmageddon. Sure there's a lot of familiar cars and drivers from the past to get that homey feeling, but all those little things that made the original -97 game so damn awesome and memorable simply don't exist under this title. Like, how did they left out the classic and much loved pratcam? I don't feel like I'm Max Damage behind the wheel anymore. Be it the time schedule or just pure laziness as the reason, but people at Stainless Games were not thinking straight. The world of Carmageddon in Reincarnation is simply uninspired and dull to look at. What happened to the original idea and feel of an apocalyptic world around you? I'm not saying all tracks are bad, but pretty much majority of the locations where tracks now take place resemble more like a theme park with a preset setting. Gone are all those crazy-long super highways with insane speed impacts (DOWNTOWN DEVASTATION anyone? :p) ...of course without forgetting twisty urban city scenery and all those underground locations calling for ultimate mayhem and destruction!\n\nCIVILIANS\n\nCivilians in the Carmageddon world always count as points and time. Not only they can be annoying and fun at the same time, but it's always been fun as hell to drive over them. All that aggression and steam you get to release when taking down a flock of them will put a smile on your lunatic face. Unfortunately the NPC's in Reincarnation are so lame. The satisfaction of killing... no, slaughtering does not exist anymore. Now it feel's like I'm taking down paper dolls which don't come even close to look like a human. I really miss those old "splatty" sprite characters from -97. Ramming NPC's at 200 MPH made their spines spin like crazy, and the fast speed only made the impact sound even louder!\n\nGAME AUDIO & MUSIC\n\nFear Factory - Zero Signal. YEAH! Naturally for the nostalgia sake they included the same track in this game, but that only gave me the false impression that this game may actually be decent. Music is hot topic and a matter of opinion, but to be frank here, I don't like this Dubstep they included now. Luckily I can shut off the music I don't like and put my own, problem solved. Unfortunately the game audio is a bit bigger problem. Alright, let's start with the car sounds. In a game like Carmageddon the engine sound is present all the time. You pretty much listen to it from the very moment the race starts and ends. In -97 pretty much every car was unique and almost each of them had their own sounds and they sounded just as you would expect. Well, Reincarnation lacks this quality. I noticed they recycled Max's Red Eagle engine sound on multiple cars. I understand this might still be a minor thing for some people, but for me hearing the same sound coming from 70% of my competitors drives me nuts. And to top it off, the engine sound is utterly ridiculous, it's just so bad! I would expect to get some nasty rumble exhaust and screams of turbos and superchargers instead of lame monotone sounding vacuum cleaners. Needless to say here, I'm also very disappointed with all light collision and heavy impact sounds. In -97 you could feel and hear twisting, sparking and scrub sounds when the metal pushed against metal. It was tingling and aggressive, but satisfying as hell. Now it's hard to tell whenever you actually do real damage or not because of the faint impact sounds. Same apply on civilians. Instead of loud limb explosions it's just "POFF*. The whole idea of Carmageddon is to be violent. When I'm having the momentum with a heavy vehicle doing top speed and going for a head on collision vs some rice cake car. I want to hear it's chassis batter to pieces LOUDLY, windows to explode LOUDLY, and to see a ton of tiny bits and material flying all over the place when cutting through it! YOU WASTED 'EM!\n\nSUMMARY\n\nDespite some of the things I don't like, I still want to give this game a try, I really do, because it's Carmageddon! But before that can happen, Stainless crew needs to focus on making the game playable with at least a reasonable frame rate, then that'll change a lot of things. They made one of the best games of all time in the late 90's. I think the fans and all backers deserve to enjoy a fully functional game. Only you can make this happen, Stainless Games.","May 22, 2015","true","21.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","5"

It was only necessary that I get Reincarnation as soon as fiscally possible. And my first word when thrown into the game was: SLLLOOOOWWWW. My computer is brand spanking new, with (what I THOUGHT were) high specs. Reincarnation threw them straight out the window. So I thought I had the settings on very high, and that was why it was so slow.\n\nThey were on medium.\n\nI said, "I might as well start at Ultra Low settings, just to see what I can improve." So I changed to Ultra Low. It made no difference! The game struggles to hold a consistent frame rate, and it only worsens when there's more terrain on the screen.\n\nBut I'm thumbing it up because it's early access! Room and time for improvement and whatnot! Stainless says it themselves in the Early Access description: "...refining and optimising all the underlying proprietary core rendering and engine code in order to make the game run smoother." I suppose I'll just be patient for the time being.","July 19, 2014","true","10.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I had doubts about the team's ability to make a Carmageddon that doesn't suck.\n\nI was wrong. I was very wrong. I am filled with shame. This game is awesome.\n\nSo we're in Beta now, and this is very much old school Carmageddon. It looks great, I'm getting pleasingly good frame rates (admittedly with a pretty pimped out system), and in general it's more fun than running a barrel over monkeys.\n\nI play using keyboard controls because 1) I've been doing that since Carma 1, 2) the controller doesn't have a wheelspin button, and 3) I have a thrustmaster controller with the buttons in different locations, that can not be remapped. Cars handle like old school Carma, so if you like that, you're great.

DNF fails almost always, but Reincarnation for the most part pulls off the gameplay loops that were the most fun in the older games.\n\nThe driving mechanics STILL are just wonky, and controllable at best. It is still a struggle to be preceise, and in a good portion of circumstances less so than in C2. The physics feels a lot better, but they don't feel seperate enough from the driving system to make it precise.\n\nThe graphics are a significant jump, but not that impressive and do not warrant the inconsistant framerate on lesser hardware. Even on a 980ti, there are times where it runs just marginally well, while most are buttery smooth... on a 980ti! My 680FTW+ 4GB struggled to keep a successful framerate however while maxed out.\n\nThe humor is still there for the most part, but either due to getting older, or the humor just not aging well (which is up to you), it just doesn't make me laugh as it once did.\n\nThe vehicles look decent, but i would have appreciated some more creativity, grunginess and slapstick.\nI wish the powerups were more projectile and less stupid gimicky jokes. Too many of them are the same or do something completely useless. When i'm trying to finish off the last competitior, all i want is a slaughter mortar, but i find 30 kangaroo on commands instead. The onlyadvantage this time around is that you can straight up buy your powerups if youve made enough cash. It would have been great if there could have been some new fail states and if they could have let the enemies use power ups on you for a change without breaking what fun there is to be had.\n\nI got this with the pack of C1, C2 and 3 all together for a decent pre-release price and i feel like that was a good value. I don't know if that deal is still going on, but i don't think i would have bought it if it didn't include all the others. C2 and 3 are still my favorites, but this is interesting and fun enough to keep me coming back when i feel like letting loose on peds and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• drivers.\n\nI can only barely recommend, but only on a sale and maybe if the bundle is still for sale.","December 7, 2015","true","9.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

Due to the performance issues and numerous bugs/oddities I didn't review the game back then but it didn't stop me from finishing the game. This is a true carmageddon game and so it is addictive. I didn't play the game since the retail version was released. I haven't seen update 1 and didn't expect much when I tried the second update. I feared the developers bet on the wrong engine and couldn't do much about the bugs and hiccups.\n\nLuckily this is not the case. This version fixes almost everything and gives the game a much needed performance boost while updating graphics! Gone are gameplay affecting bugs like stuck powerup effects slowing things down and collision weirdness. My only complaint left is the loading time. While it's not outlandish anymore it is still long on slower processors (it seems CPU is the bottleneck here not HDD/SSD). The game starts as soon as it finishes loading. I prefer a <<press any key when ready>> message so I can walk away/do something else in the meanwhile.\n\nOther than that, highly recommended!","November 19, 2015","true","53.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I would recommend this game to anyone familiar with the original Carmageddon. The game is fast-paced, although, like the original, inherently quite repetitive - kill, wreck or chase POIs :-) It definitely is worth trying out though, straight-forward with relatively good learning curve, you could also call it casual gaming, playing it for some time, then leaving it be and coming back whenever you are fed up with some of the deeper-story games you have lined up and need a bit of a rest from.","January 20","true","4.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

This is a review of - Carmageddon Reincarnation. Game is very good, masterpiece very good. It has vehicles with wheels and few more pedestrians. You can run them over and they fall down. Then you put it in reverse and you run them over again, if you catch my drift!\n\nCustomization is excellent, you can change coloros of your car. Coloros or skins as they call them in game. That is another 2 points up.\n\nI didnt try multiplayer just yet, cause if I did then this would get 15 out of 10 from me. But - that is not possible, sou I dont play multiplayer so it can get 10 out of 10.\n\nThere is one minor problem, its called optimization which is not very good. It is bad frame rate occasionally. You wanna go fast, but you cant, when de fps drop. Then de fps goes up again and youre charmed again and fast in crashing.\n\nFor optimization I take 1 point down. Sou this game is 9 out of ten.

Just as crass (if not a little more so), just as hectic, just as fun to play, but with SO MUCH MORE POLISH. Fantastic fidelity, the same cast of memorable characters/cars, and a few nice extra features like a super robust replay mode, and a ton of new powers that add a bit more fun. This game is exactly what gaming does best, escapism. Get into a weird, wacky car, and just do what you like. Want to be the best racer and post the best times? You can, and are rewarded for it. Want to wreck every opponent you see? You can, and are equally rewarded. Want to kill every squishy living thing on the map? You guessed it, rewards all around. It's a playground of destruction and ridiculousness, and I not only thoroughly enjoy the play, but I absolutely laughed out loud quite a few times.

If you expect realistic driving phyiscs and racing wheel support and such, then you'll be sorely disappointed, becuse that is not what Carmageddon in about. It's a free for all "kill anything that moves" type game, and if you go into it with that in mind, it can be a whole lot of fun. I'm not sure if I like all of the new race types, but hey, you don't have to play career mode, so you can choose to just play the type of races you prefer.\n\nThis isn't the type of game you delve into for hours on end. It's a quick fix of fun madness, and as such I think it works really well. If you're familiar with the old ones, you'll know what you get. Carmageddon II: Carpocalypse Now is probably still my favourite of the series, but it's more than "a bit" long in the tooth by now, and doesn't really look that impressive anymore.\n\nThere are some flaws with this game though.\nI am somebody who suffers from issues with motion sickness from first person shooters and similar games. I don't normally have those types of problems with driving games (I can play Assetto Corsa for hours without any issues), but Carmageddon: Reincarnated can quite easily give me motion sickness (and I tend to get it quite bad), but this isn't an issue that will affect the majority of gamers I expect. I wanted to mention it anyway though.\nMore important is the fact that this game has some pretty steep system requirements. When I first tried it out, I had a Radeon HD6870 CrossFire setup on an i7 920@3.78GHz, and it was totally unplayable. We're talking slideshow (5fps, sometimes a lot less) even at the lowest of settings. Upgrading to a Radeon R9 280x made the game playable, but still not completely smooth. It did allow me to run my native resolution though (1920x1200 for me), and the game looks great even on lower settings. In fact, I find a lof othe blur effects used for "depth perspective" and such to look absolutely horrible and make my head go funny.\nI am currently running an i7 6700k @ 4.7GHz, 32GB DDR4 and an R9 Fury. My steam drive is a Samsung 850 EVO and although the game now runs "pretty well", there are still occasional fps dips. If you haven't got a pretty badass gaming PC, then you can probably forget about running this game.\n\nTL;DR - This is pretty much "more of the same", and as such, it's hard to really fault it. Carmageddon is good fun. Great for short sessions of complete mayhem, if you have the system specs to run it that is.","December 8, 2015","true","5.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

However, each update brought something massive to the table: performance upgrades, graphics upgrades, new content, etc. Now this game runs buttery smooth, and it's bursting with content to use and mess around with. The devs truly care about their product, and they seem to be quite determined to make it even better.\n\nFirst off, the career can be a bit repetitive, but unlocking everything can be quite satisfying. However, if playing through the career (and also completing various challenges) to unlock things doesn't really float your boat, the CarMODgeddon mode allows you to have free use of everything from the get-go with the added support of mods, which can also be used in multiplayer.\n\nMultiplayer is a bit bare-bones at the moment, but it's still quite fun if you want to screw around with a few friends. There's unfortunately no local multiplayer, but hopefully that'll be added in the future. There are also some glitches here and there regarding things like challenges, so it can be a bit irritating if you're a completionist.\n\nDespite some shortcomings, this game is just pure fun. There are a variety of modes, and the main mode "Classic Carma" can be beaten through either racing, wrecking all of your opponents, or the difficult (but satisfying) challenge of killing all of the pedestrians. Powerups are scattered about, allowing for a lot of crazy, chaotic fun, and a wide selection of vehicles also assures you methods of tackling challenges in many different ways. Even other modes, such as Death Race, can be won through pure mayhem; wrecking opponents and stealing their lap counts.\n\nThe physics also allow for some incredibly crazy situations, and the detail behind the cars can leave you in awe. They can twist, crumble, and dent in almost any way, and by the end of a match, you can "inspect" the vehicles to see how heavily-damaged they got in the end, and there can sometimes be some pretty hilarious results. Pedestrians aren't quite as detailed, but that's not to say they aren't a lot of fun to kill as well. This game is jam-packed with blood... so much so that at the end of a match, your vehicle could be absolutely covered in the stuff.\n\nSuffice to say, this is a fun game with very little restriction on how you can approach things, effectively making it more of a virtual sandbox than a proper competitive game. I've wasted away quite a number of hours just messing around, exploring, and testing out different vehicles.\n\nAll-in-all, if what I just explained sounds like fun, you will probably like it.\n\nTL;DR - Great time-waster for your more sadistic side, don't expect anything too deep.","December 23, 2015","true","88.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I like how they've revamped everything and introduced some new features along the way. I'm glad some of the opponents from the original are in this, like Ivan, Madam Scarlett, Stella Stunna and The Brothers Grimm, because they didn't go over into Carmageddon 2 or Carmageddon TDR2000. They REALLY have gone to town on the vehicles, they're way, way, WAY better than any previous version. The only thing I didn't like was how you had to collect tokens to upgrade your car.

How can I kill a pedestrian? Let me count the ways....\n\nThis reboot of Carmageddon feels true to the original DOS version of many moons lost. It has the same cars, the same  power-ups, the same scale of speed, impact and brute force. It even hs the same epic battles with the pigs, *cough*, I mean... "police" as the original. It brings to the table a modern refresh of the original in all it's bloody glory.\n\nIt does however fall short of the mark in overall execution and  presentation. The game is nowhere near finished and the so called "trailers" which feature ultra HD, ray traced models, do not represent in any way what you get in terms of in-game graphics.\n\nShould you care? The game play is solid, even if the in-game graphics and content are not. These can be easily ignored if the underlying gameplay is solid, and it is. Expect graphics on par with Carmageddon 2 Carpocalypse Now @ 20~30 FPS. This game is nowhere near finished. If you can overlook this and are not expecting much past the Max Pack for DOS, then this title willl shine. If you are after post year 2K quality of graphics I recommend you wait until Stainless are finished. From where I am sitting it is a 50/50 call wether they are doing minimal effort to rake in some cash and skip town. Overall recommended for die-hard fans of the series. Otherwise wait until the game is finished (It's been a while).\n\nIn a nutshell - Recommended... just.","April 22, 2015","true","5.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

Completing the race- Never encouraged and you were barely rewarded for doing so, races would tend to prove more costly racing than anything\n2. Mowing down all of the pedestrians- Which takes great exploration, patience and skill and you‚Äôre rewarded well for doing it and\n3. Destroying all of your opponents- The most favourite and most common method of winning a Carmageddon event\n\nIn Reincarnation this has come to be known as the ‚ÄòClassic Carma‚Äô event but Reincarnation adds a lot of other events into the mix such as Checkpoint Stampede which involves players racing to as many checkpoints as possible before the rest of their opponents, Ped Stampede which is the same as Checkpoint Stampede but you‚Äôre racing to mow down specific pedestrians before your opponents, Car Crusher which is a demolition derby style mode where the only way to win is to wreck your opponents and Death Race which is just a race.\n\nNow whilst I‚Äôm all for innovation especially with older games, Carmageddon was always about being able to win the game how you want to win it and when you‚Äôre being presented with an event where the only way to win is to actually race it feels not only like the whole ‚Äòantidote to racing games‚Äô and touting Carmageddon as an anti-racing game is actually a lie but it also doesn‚Äôt feel like Carmageddon, even though Stainless Games have to their credit tried to give the players additional unique ways to beat these events, for example in a Death Race event you can waste other opponents and steal their laps instead of actually racing, these gamemodes still feel like a shoe-horned in effort to present a wider variety of content without actually providing new content. I was always fine with these events being solely-multiplayer modes as they used to be in the previous games, presenting them as actual gamemodes feels the same as Quake III Arena‚Äôs singleplayer mode, it‚Äôs just multiplayer but with (AI) bots.\n\nWhilst I‚Äôm on the subject of content I must mention that Carmageddon: Reincarnation doesn‚Äôt have as much as other games in the franchise, whilst it does offer more than enough content to keep you happy the game does feel like it‚Äôs prolonging your experience by recycling the same levels a lot, this feels especially true in the career mode where you‚Äôre given 16 tiers of events to complete and within these tiers is around 3-4 different races, each one of these races is a different gamemode, the first one being Classic Carma and the remaining events being a mixture of the new stuff, now the game has only a handful of environments so it throws a lot of events at you and a lot of these are within the same environments just with different track layouts but one positive thing is that the game doesn‚Äôt force you to complete every single event as each tier is unlocked by accruing a certain amount of credits within the previous tier, so if you hated Death Race and only wanted to play Classic Carma (like me) then you can just replay Classic Carma events to get enough credits to unlock the next tier, which is a nice compromise.\n\nI‚Äôve made it clear that I don‚Äôt like how few environments we‚Äôre presented with in the game but what we are given is insanely detailed and every level has plenty of things that you can do, be it collecting Smelly Bushes (yes, you read that right), finding ‚Äòcash cows‚Äô or just exploring little side areas and interiors, a lot of work has been put into fleshing out each of these environments and giving them life and they really do feel great with thousands of different accessories just sitting about waiting to be destroyed, you really feel like you‚Äôre causing havoc in a living world. Stainless Games have also confirmed that they will be adding another environment to the game in a future update, which is nice of them and should alleviate the repetition.\n\nComplaints aside Carmageddon: Reincarnation is a stunning game and really takes the franchise into the modern day gaming world, the most impressive aspects of the game are the vehicles, they‚Äôre intricately detailed each with their own personality, they‚Äôre donned with blades, spikes and all manner of ped-maiming weaponry, every vehicle has it‚Äôs own modelled suspension that buckles if you push it too hard, the vehicles crumple and deform to where they‚Äôre hit and tyres deflate and come loose from rims just as if you were plowing real cars into each other and all of this happens without the game dropping a single frame, it really is an impressive sight to see!\n\nNow I‚Äôd like to address the performance of the game, I am running an i5-2500, 8GB RAM and an NVidia GTX 560 (1GB VRAM) my system is around 4 years old, so it‚Äôs getting on a bit but Carmageddon: Reincarnation will run on mostly High settings with a few of the major ones on Medium at my full screen resolution of 1680X1050 without issue, it doesn‚Äôt run at a constant 60fps and tends to stick between the 40-50 mark though it rarely ever drops below 30 which for a game as complex as this is quite astounding.\n\nThe game boasts a wide variety of different graphics options so you‚Äôre able to tweak the game to your liking to get the best experience possible out of it but because it streams in virtual textures as you‚Äôre playing you cannot really adjust texture quality to your liking as this happens automatically based on the amount of VRAM you have available, so you should take this into account when playing as it needs a lot of horsepower in not only your GPU but also your CPU and hard drive to get the best out of it but with that being said it will run just fine on a mid-range system, load times are on average 45 seconds for me which is also fairly impressive given the amount of assets that the game loads in initially.\n\nIn pre-alpha and alpha I couldn‚Äôt even get the game running at anything other than sub-5fps but Stainless have really polished their baby and added a lot of love, care and attention to turn it into what it is today and that‚Äôs quite possibly the most-fun (anti) racing game on the market, filled to the brim with humour, gore, crazy powerups, impressive tech and most important of all fun and for pure enjoyment alone I would highly recommend another romp in the Carmageddon universe with Carmageddon: Reincarnation.\n\nDon‚Äôt forget that mods are already starting to roll out for the game and when the Carmageddon community gets into it‚Äôs stride with modding nothing can stop us, the game will continue to stay fresh for many years due to mod support.","June 7, 2015","true","60.4"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","10","19","0","0"

I was always a fan of Carma since the 2nd Carma was the best last. I used to play that game for hours because the maps were fun and it just kind of sucks you in. This one sets the bar so much better. I hope they will release a 4th. They better!\nI read the reviews prior to purchasing this but pulled the trigger regardless as Carma is just too fun not to have and am i glad i did!\nHere is what I liked:\n\nREPLAY FACTOR- Insane replay factor. You can literally play this game a million ways and always find ways to entertain yourself. I am never uninstalling this and would love an actual physical copy (more of a nostalgia thing from the original )\n\nLEVELS-The levels are enormous so much exploration here, I can see myself spending countless hours on each map going to new places and driving around.\n\nCARS-the car models are awesome\n\nDAMAGE- damage physics are amazing. No GTA game has anywhere near awesome damage physics for cars, the deformations and impact is very cool almost has a close NGBeam game engine style for damage. To me, car physics are a big deal, If the damage doesnt look convincing then whats the point of crashing. I never found GTA to be good at physics, they should learn from Carmageddon.\n\nPOWERUPS- Very creative and fun power ups allow you to do so much damage it never gets old\n\nGORE- The gore on this is awesome, i love how they expanded on the gore and made it so much more fun\n\nGRAPHICS- Sure its not Project Cars pretty or GTA budget but from where it came originally this is good enough!!!! Dont expect it to be life like, it is not meant to be, maybe in the future they will, that would be nice! Relax and enjoy it!\n\nNEEDED IMPROVEMENTS-\n\nOverall this is a keeper 100%, but as of its initial release on 5/21 the game does need to be updated ASAP at least in the following areas.\n\n-OPTIMIZE THIS ENGINE NOW- By today's standards and the price we pay for having high end rigs, the frame rate should not run the way it does on PC's. Unless you are playing on a very old graphics card then its one story, but for most part a game like this even for PS3/PS4 is expected to run a steady 60FPS, and so should our computers. Cannot run this @ 60 with max settings which it must. Dont pull an Arma3 move and leave everyone trying to figure out whats wrong with their computers when the engine is busted no-one wants to play below 60 FPS today. Stainless knows this already from our comments, i just hope they are doing everything they can. We want to see 60 FPS min\n\n-DOWNLOADABLE CONTENT-\nEventually would be pretty good idea to release DLC content which includes new vehicles, maps , Power Ups\n\n-GAME UPDATES-\nAs many as possible here. The more the merrier.\n\nSo after all of the positives and the negatives, by all means buy this game but DO NOT change your Graphics settings to any other level other than stock and you will be fine until they release an update.\n","May 24, 2015","true","11.3"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","0"

The return of old Carmageddon characters just makes me scream of joy as I see them (Howver, Vlad is still even uncontrolable, il say he is even more). The challenge in the game is present and fun, and the classic way of unlocking cars is always goin to be my favourite "Wreck the car in this even to unlock it". Some problems however somewhat makes the game less enjoyable, like the insanely long loading times (Still a Beta, so its pretty normal for it to not go at 100%) and when the game MISTAKELY crashes when I compleeted the race. However you get prompted with a quite hilarious error message. The multi is fun, especialy with a full group. The cars in rhis game are all awesome, mostly are from the old games, while others (well like, 2) are tottaly new to the series. The music? EPIC! Dubstep or Heavy Metal, two good flavors!\n\nIf you love cars, being agressive on the road, blood, and running over living things, this game can be considered as Anger Management 101. So?

Its a god awful mess on my machine, but what do you expect from a 4 year old laptop potato. I can't wait for this to be finished and optimized nicely. I also can't wait till I splurge and get an upgraded desktop. Even with all of its stutters on the lowest settings, causing opponents to vanish if you weren't actively hitting them.

I think that Carmageddon 1 and 2 brought much more for their time in the 90s than this game does now.\n\nPros:\n-Looks good,\n-Cool effects (e.g. parts flying back to the car as it is repaired),\n-Decent crash physics,\n-Simple fun, and\n-Runs smooth on a i5 2500 & GTX 970 machine at a 2560 x 1440 resolution on max settings minus antialiasing (~50 FPS).  Antialiasing drops the FPS down to ~42 FPS, which is still smooth.\n\nCons:\n-No standalone multiplayer servers - have to wait for someone to host a game, or become a host and wait a considerable amount of time... recommend playing with friends,\n-All cars appear to be AWD (all wheel drive).. constantly spinning all 4 wheels in most situations (this bothers me quite a bit),\n-I realize that this isn't a simulator, but expected more out of driving physics 20 years later, and\n-Expected more overall from the game besides visual updates over Carma 1 & 2.  It feels like a mix of Carma 1 & 2, without anything new really.. and those are old games.\n\nBought the game at 50%-off sale price.

Though it was probably WAAYYYY inappropriate for an 8 year old, my parents were great and allowed me to experience things young knowing that I wasn't going to grow up to be a mass pedestrian killer or badass alien slayer (Duke Nukem was a big game for me at this time as well)\n\nMe and my friends would have riotous fun playing Carmageddon and Carmageddon 2 way back when on old crappy Packard Bell (WHO!?) PC's. Those games are highly nostalgic and I have very fond memories looking back.\n\nObviously when they announced they were working on a sequel and needed funding, I immediately backed the project and bought an early access copy. I've checked in out and as progress has been made, I was delighted with progress.\n\nBut then we got closer to release and the game was still so terribly optimised... NOW we have an official full release and the game still runs awfully. I've logged into various PC's with different specs and it runs like turd from an amazing rig, to a crappy laptop.\n\nI'm just... disappointed, it feel's like Carma but is barely playable. My advice is to wait and see if there's improvement before laying down your hard earned money.","May 21, 2015","false","6.3"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","8","16","0","2"

Apart from a graphical update (lacking as i was saying), there's no real innovation, same cars, same tracks, well, it's pretty much the same game.\n\nThe bonuses are fun, but most of them are pretty useless, the physics model is sometimes pretty strange, and the game as a whole is somewhat repetitive.","June 7, 2015","false","33.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","5"

If you try to handbrake turn, you just spin out for about 10 seconds. It's ridiculous. The cars are also made of tissue paper; all it takes is to get hit from behind or the side and you're wrecked. Meanwhile, you pull the same move on an opponent, and they limp away, or better yet, the physics engine makes you start doing doughnuts at high speed, or hit a curb and be catapulted 100 feet into the air for a mile down the road, before you can hit them.\n\n2) The game modes. Classic Carma or bust. The new game modes stink. That random checkpoint spawn mode is just that -- random. By the time the next one spawns, and you can even turn around to pursue it, it's gone. What makes it even more infurating is the maps; that refinery map is a tight little maze in which it's impossible to maneuver because of the vehicle physics above. You try to turn your car, but you just go into a doughnut spiral for 10 seconds and end up driving into the ocean or something. It's a joke.\n\nThese issues fixed, yes, I think Reincarnation would be a lot of fun, but it's just infurating to play like this. It'd be nice to see the original Max Pack vehicles make an appearance, also (Mother Trucker). Anyway, until these issues are fixed, it's a thumbs down for me.\n\nAside, the soundtrack is top notch, yet again, so I've got to hand it to Stainless for that. Is it possible to get the soundtrack somewhere?

The return of old Carmageddon characters just makes me scream of joy as I see them (Howver, Vlad is still even uncontrolable, il say he is even more). The challenge in the game is present and fun, and the classic way of unlocking cars is always goin to be my favourite "Wreck the car in this even to unlock it". Some problems however somewhat makes the game less enjoyable, like the insanely long loading times (Still a Beta, so its pretty normal for it to not go at 100%) and when the game MISTAKELY crashes when I compleeted the race. However you get prompted with a quite hilarious error message. The multi is fun, especialy with a full group. The cars in rhis game are all awesome, mostly are from the old games, while others (well like, 2) are tottaly new to the series. The music? EPIC! Dubstep or Heavy Metal, two good flavors!\n\nIf you love cars, being agressive on the road, blood, and running over living things, this game can be considered as Anger Management 101. So? Get it! ^w^","February 21, 2015","true","44.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

It's got the Carma spirit with nice little additions, runs smoothly for all the sprites and models that have to constantly get crushagged and fly around.\n\nThe comments are, as always, flooded with butthurt 10 year-olds but here's the sitch. It runs smooth, and way better than I could've expected. If you have problems running it, you probably overestimate your machine's abilities. Mess with the settings for an optimal quality:performance ratio.\n\nCan it be improved? Of course. In the future I'd like to have the chance to make my own cars, but I'm also going to try and mod that in myself, since it comes with the ability to easily mod.\n\n\nIn short; if you grew up with Carma, like I did, you'll like this game. If not, but you still want a game to pass time with, buy it. It's got everything you'd want from a Carma game.

After booting this game up and playing for a few hours, the nostalgia wore off quickly. The handling of the vehicles is abyssmal. Your vehicle literally goes careening out of control as soon as you hit the smallest piece of debris. The controls are also a horrible. I used a gamepad and I had to select from 3 present control types, all which sucked donkey balls. The input keys for the gamepad cannot be customized, which leads to high levels of frustration when you're caught in a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•torm and you press the wrong ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing button.\n\nThe overall mechanics of the game aren't laid out that well either. The weapon selection is a pain in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and the weapons themselves are explained very well. It's more of a trial and error. Not to mention, the hit detection to pick up powerups is a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing joke.\n\nAfter all the years of reminiscing about this game, I was severely disappointed by this steaming pile of dogshit.","January 2","false","2.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Its not hard because of interesting AI, or level design, or even because things get chaotic... Its hard because the cars are impossible to steer.

The only thing you will do in this game over and over again is try and keep your car in a straight line, brake long before you need to turn, almost to a complete stop, and then you can turn. But then don't accelerate too much too soon or you'll just end up spinning around. And don't bother trying to correct either, or you'll just end up fishtailing.\n\nHonestly don't buy this one.

This is an Early Access game and boy does it show!  It's limited by the choice of vehicles, courses and lack of mulitplayer, but all those things are progressing and following the Livestreams shows new content being added all the time.  Apart from the livestream builds being crazily unstable!\n\nBut all that aside, it is Carmageddon!  Both in terms of gameplay, comedy and style.  It looks amazing even in the Early Access builds, the gore is correctly over the top, the cars manoevre and bend just so and the entire thing has more content than some finished products even now.  Is it earth shattering?  Right now, probably not, but then we have not tried the Multiplayer or any other final content.  This is stripped back and barebones for a Carma title.\n\nIf you have ever loved Carmageddon, this is the modern and worthy successor and an essential addition to the series, but if you have never tried Carma in the past, is it worth it then?  Well,  as it is, it would probably take some persuasion to make a new player commit, but I think it is an experience that every gamer has to try at least once....  You have to remember that the earlier incarnations of Carmageddon caused media backlashes as the series was running down peeps in third / first person when GTA was still an overhead view.\n\nThat's what I couldn't place!  As a player of the original Carma's 1, Splat Pack, 2 and TDR2000, it's quaint!  But that's not a bad thing at all.  The feeling of tradition in Reincarnation is there.  This game will carry on the tradiition of Carma, sticking up two fingers to the man and letting grimy racing games continue!  In a way, I hope the media rises up in another backlash as development continues, since it'll only bring the game more spotlight.\n\nJust one word of warning, the builds are horribly unoptimised, so check your rig before you buy, it needs to be beefy to run it smoothly right now, but the specs should become more reasonable as the alpha build we currently have progresses into more of a beta state, but don't hold your breath, since Stainless has commited to a 'few update builds' model for Early Access.  It is understandable since they are a small team and have little time to step aside from the main coding to produce smaller 'Release Alpha / Beta Builds'.  They tie up too much time and work hours in the team.  Although they have promised 'Milestone Builds' to help advertise major new features (MP should be a Milestone Build), as well as allow the players a chance to bug test and stress their work a little.\n\nSo, yes, get Reincarnation....  The new bonuses of the earlier games are nice, but it doesn't distract from what should be a spectacular main event.  Long live the comedy, gore and car bending!","October 8, 2014","true","38.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Carmageddon is pretty awesome if you like crashing into cars without caring what so ever. To win in this game you either have to wreck everyone, do all the races or kill all the humans on the stage. This games are Very VERY bloody and had their fair share of banns in diffrent lands. The game comes with a kickass music to it which will make you feel like that you are ready to wreck them or to get wrecked.\n\nI want to play more of this game but..... seeing it's barely working, it's actually a wonder seeing it being able to run at it current stage. If you do want to play this unfinished version then expect long loading times ( I am not joking about that!)\n\nWell I am off to play Carmageddon 2 since it's the best game in the series and yes Carmageddon 2 is on steam as well and that was rated 20+ back in my days when I was a kid.\n\n\nPS: Kids should not play these games, they are to weak to handle all this gore and heavy metal music!","October 9, 2014","true","0.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I bought my early access pass from sale a couple of months ago, so there was no going back anyway. Fired up the game for the first time now, and... after some of fun, can't say I'm disappointed. This review is after playing the single player mode for two hours. (Edit: see comments at the end for six hour remarks.)\n\nThe graphics, especially the textures are outdated for sure. But that doesn't really bother when you are playing. It has a really strong Carmageddon 2 vibe to it, and I think the not so pretty graphics are part of it. Of course, they could have made a really, really "beautiful" Carmageddon game, but for reasons unknown (skill, time, money) this is what we got. I consider it more of a stylistic choice. Maybe we'll see the Crysis of Carmageddons in the future.\n\nConsidering the graphics, the game does run a bit slow, but it's still completely playable and enjoyable. During my two hours of gaming, FPS has dropped below 40 FPS only a few times. In some levels it stays above 50 FPS, whereas with others just over 40, but it never goes above 60. What's more important is that the FPS does not seem to fluctuate much in a level. If a level runs say, 55 FPS in the beginning, that's the rate it probably runs for the whole round. I have some details maxed, and antialiasing is on, resolution is 1920x1080. Also, loading times are 30-40 seconds for a round. Not that speedy, but certainly not unbelievably slow either, and certainly tolerable. Menus work really smoothly and quickly. No crashes either yet.\n\nMy rig is a couple of years old: Intel i5 3570 @ 4 GHz, Radeon 7870 GHz edition with 2 GB of memory, 16 GB of RAM, a regular defragmented HDD, and Windows 8.1 Pro. Very few processes running besides Steam in the background.\n\nAt this point, seems like good old Carmageddon fun. Nothing too fancy, but certainly enjoyable. The -50% sale I got it from seems like a good price for this, the full price is just a tad steep - for example with a better soundtrack it would be easily justified. I hope the reason for the severe performance issues some people are having will be identified and fixed soon. I will update this review should I encounter such showstoppers myself.\n\nEdit: I just tried fiddling with the visual settings. Apparently, car reflections kill the FPS quickly. Keep it to medium at max. And shadows low. Other settings you may max out and still get decent FPS.\n\nEdit 2: 6 hours in now. At this point one has noticed all the flaws in the game. Some of the rounds do get boring, as the AI competitors just get stuck to some corners, and some of the levels feel somewhat empty. The music gets quite annoying, especially if nothing is happening in the race (all the others that are left are stuck somewhere) but it just keeps on pounding like there was some tight action going on, which there isn't. Only 30 % career mode completed says the game, not sure if I have the patience to finish it. Performance has been pretty much as described earlier, albeit if three cars explode at the same time, there is a momentary drop in FPS, but nothing too serious. Right now the biggest problem seems to be that the game is getting a bit boring, and that's more of a design issue rather than a technical one. Still recommended for Carmageddon fans, but with reservations.","May 22, 2015","true","13.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I wanted to LOVE this game.  But, for the time being, I have to say 'no' to recommending it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's a new Carmageddon game.  It just doesn't quite have the same feel to it - your car feels weaker in this than previous games, though they did have the same 'sloppy' handling feel to them.  There's a lot of things they got right in this one.  The time ticks up quickly enough to give you a chance to explore, but you do need to be wary of it early on.  Unlike the third game with the hard 5 minute cap that prevented real exploration.  A lot of the classic cars are back.  The game play, the power ups, the cops.  All the elements are there to make this a good nostalgic game.\n\nBut there are bugs.  Lots of bugs.  Bugs that I didn't mind during Early Access, because the game was still being worked on then.  But we're not in Early Access anymore.  We've even had a couple major updates since then.  And some of the bugs persist.  Bugs such as some car skins not unlocking when they're supposed to.  Challenges and Achievements not properly tracking.  There's even instances where your car can get wrecked several times in a row, causing you to lose big on events where points are deducted for wrecks.  (Worst case I've had, one wreck cost me six points, because I got wrecked, was instantly wrecked again when I hit the ground (was mid air), got wrecked again while being teleported away and hit the ground, wrecked again when spawned, once more as the car that hit me the first time hit me again while my car was still 'weakened' trying to repair itself, and a final time spawning and hitting the ground again.)  There's a lot of times when the AI goes out of its way to harass you, the player, in career mode - even when the event calls for different objectives.  (Such as Fox N' Hound, when the AI will constantly try to run into you even if you're not the fox.)  I've also had instances in races where all five of the opponents, in the first two minutes of the match, decided to ignore everything and just try to wreck me over and over.\n\nThere are some interesting touches, but the game doesn't do a good job telling you about them.  For example, to upgrade, you MUST collect upgrade tokens.  What the game doesn't tell you is that these are spawned randomly, based on how badly the car you are currently in needs them.  I had completed half the campaign mode in just the Eagle because I didn't have enough points to fully upgrade it yet, let alone have enough to begin upgrading any other car.  Eventually I decided to give the Degoryun a chance anyway.  I picked up 36 upgrade tokens in one race, enough to fully upgrade three cars.  So, yea, use the other vehicles it gives you.\n\nAnother new feature, which lead to one of the big bugs above I talked about, is that when your car is damaged, repairing it just pulls the missing pieces to your car.  And your care will remain in the weakened state until those parts arrive.  And sometimes, particularly if you've been pushed around a lot, it can take a while for those parts to arrive.  Long enough to be wrecked several times while waiting for it.\n\nThe controller support is a bit questionable as well.  It claims you can do a wheel spin by double tapping the throttle.  But that has never worked for me.  (Keyboard has a nice button that acts as that.)  Plus, you can't set the controller however you like, only set it based on a few pre-selected layouts.  There's also a problem where the camera options are reset with every different car, meaning I am placed FAR too close to my vehicle every time I switch.\n\nOther bugs include not properly marking which map the remaining hidden items are on (not that I've had much luck finding ANY marking of where the hidden items are).  Pedestrians floating in mid air.  If you're on a checkpoint in checkpoint race when it spawns you have to leave it and come back in (yes, I call this a bug, it shouldn't spawn on top of people anyway).  Having the graphics of the level flicker in and out of existence.  Having the UI get stuck so it doesn't properly display what power up is selected.  Etc. Etc.\n\nAs stated, this game is fully released now.  But there are things missing.  It has at least been fairly optimized finally (though some people claim the most recent patch made it worse again for them).  There's a decent amount to do.. when it works.  But in this state?  No, I can't recommend it.  Maybe once all of these bugs are fixed (and, no, things like achievements not properly tracking or unlocking what they're supposed to unlock are not 'too minor to worry about', what they ARE is an indication of laziness that a simple bug has never been fixed) then I can revisit this review, and give this game the recommendation it should deserve.  But until then, no.  It may be Carmageddon, but it's a mess.","November 9, 2015","false","18.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I have a reasonably high end rig so I'm not experiencing performance issues that others have had. The game is also pure Carmageddon, if you loved the original then it's exactly as it should be.\n\nBut I get why some people might feel short changed. It's for the same reasons I guess Duke Nukem will probably never be a money making franchise again. Some things are great because deep down they are actually ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.

For about 10 years I have periodically tried to install and run Carmageddon again, and failed. I also always wondered why nobody was redoing it, with nothing like it's career mode on any other game I tried.\nSo I was chuffed to spot it doing the crowdfunding rounds a year or so back. And now it's working on steam at last.\nReview (Oct 2014) - the fundamentals are all there now. Drive about, run stuff over, wreck each other. The humour is the same schoolboy crude silliness, and the zombies of my youth are now pedestrians. Bugs, glitches various ofc, but it's not finished. Looks like mostly needs content finishing and few tweaks to complete.\nMarch 2015 - beta, all is working, few odd bugs still, occasional crash, but mostly works well. Apparently full career mode working, I'm losing lots of hours when too tired to play serious games.\nSo yes probably worth ¬£20 for the game, but defo worth it with the original and 2 thrown in and working on steam too.","October 9, 2014","true","32.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I have played every version of the carma series and the lack of more creativity in this game is very disapointing. The same old power ups mainly from the carma's before. The cars , the physics are ok, I prefer the faster more controllable driving of the tdr series. The maps are typical carma, nothing new or inventive really. Where is the on track catapult???, or speed boost arrows?, or the occasional nuke maybe? C'mon man , have some vision. The game is still pretty buggy. It just crashed on me at close to 200k of bonus, very irritating.\nThe game is fun, but I am still very irritated at the lack of vision and creativity. The boring cliche lines of dialogue are terrible, along with the music. No in game music player option either.

Speaking of which, the events so far are much too biased towards racing or winning checkpoints, such that there's no time to be enjoying any of the fun stuff like powerups, collecting upgrades, exploring, doing stunts etc. I am averagely good at these sort of games but I found myself repeatedly restarting races just because I'd flipped over or hit a wall, because I knew there was no hope of winning and therefore progressing.

Oh my god it's just completely ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•en ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.\n\nBasically the only way to kill enemies apart from sheer luck and frustration is Opponent Repulsificator, Anvil Launcher.. Maybe mines...

It's just not okay and it's not fun and this totally destroys the game for me.\n\nOh that and the uninspired level design which lacks the fun little hidden hidey holes and easter eggs that were abundant in the originals..

Optimisation in this game is at the moment: sh*t. I don't have a "Monster Rig", that's true, but even this poor little 3 (almost 4) year old laptop can take on Skyrim on max with minimum lag or even Crysis 3 on very high with minimum lag. However THIS game, I have to play on "Best Performance" or A.K.A: Very Low. Even that lags a little bit. I know, this game came out in 2014 and now it entered the beta stage in February 2015, so comparing it with older games seems pointless.\nBut I own Dying Light, I am playing it on High, the only thing I have to adjust is the view distance and I get almost zero FPS drops or lag.\nFPS drops and those minimal lags don't bother me really, becuase they are barely noticable and bother only those who care about "Teh Grafics" more than the care about the gameplay. What does bother me is the fact that when I choose the "Better Performance" option, the game starts to become unplayable. Higher than that and it chokes my computer like an Asphyxation amateur = chokes too hard, doesn't know when to stop. Poor comparison...\n\nMost of cars (I think all of them actually?) sound the same. The medicore "dubstep-esque" music is getting tiresome. Wish the game had a Track Select list like Need For Sanic or Project Gotham Reaper. The metal is fine though.\nThat dubstep music wouldn't bother me much, if the game decided to shuffle the music a little better, because all I'm getting 90% of the time is the effin dubstep. Rarely I get to hear the music I grew up with: the classic Carma intro song.\n\nThe Positives\nNonetheles, beta is EXTREMELY fun. I've been playing the new update for 2 hours now (at the time of writing) and not a single crash, no bugs, the AI is challenging, a number of maps are present, various game modes each of them tons of fun, 30+ cars... It's awesome. It took them almost 1 year to get to Beta from Alpha and they improved the game A LOT. The loading times are 4x faster than before (on my computer and yes, I timed it), the upgrade system is back, you can change your car's skin and rims... This is ALMOST a paradise for any Carma fan. Almost, because of the negatives I mentioned earlier.\n\nConclusion\nIf you're a Carma fan and you have a Monster Rig or you don't care if you play on lowest settings: get this game.\nIf you are bother by those things, wait until the game is released or at least optimised for older computers (or invest in a new one), because right now I can't enjoy "Teh Grafics" and if you too have a 3/4 year old computer, you probably won't either... unless you bought a Monster Rig back then, then you won't have any problems...

Optimisation in this game is at the moment: sh*t. I don't have a "Monster Rig", that's true, but even this poor little 3 (almost 4) year old laptop can take on Skyrim on max with minimum lag or even Crysis 3 on very high with minimum lag. However THIS game, I have to play on "Best Performance" or A.K.A: Very Low. Even that lags a little bit. I know, this game came out in 2014 and now it entered the beta stage in February 2015, so comparing it with older games seems pointless.\nBut I own Dying Light, I am playing it on High, the only thing I have to adjust is the view distance and I get almost zero FPS drops or lag.\nFPS drops and those minimal lags don't bother me really, becuase they are barely noticable and bother only those who care about "Teh Grafics" more than the care about the gameplay. What does bother me is the fact that when I choose the "Better Performance" option, the game starts to become unplayable. Higher than that and it chokes my computer like an Asphyxation amateur = chokes too hard, doesn't know when to stop. Poor comparison...\n\nMost of cars (I think all of them actually?) sound the same. The medicore "dubstep-esque" music is getting tiresome. Wish the game had a Track Select list like Need For Sanic or Project Gotham Reaper. The metal is fine though.\nThat dubstep music wouldn't bother me much, if the game decided to shuffle the music a little better, because all I'm getting 90% of the time is the effin dubstep. Rarely I get to hear the music I grew up with: the classic Carma intro song.\n\nThe Positives\nNonetheles, beta is EXTREMELY fun. I've been playing the new update for 2 hours now (at the time of writing) and not a single crash, no bugs, the AI is challenging, a number of maps are present, various game modes each of them tons of fun, 30+ cars... It's awesome. It took them almost 1 year to get to Beta from Alpha and they improved the game A LOT. The loading times are 4x faster than before (on my computer and yes, I timed it), the upgrade system is back, you can change your car's skin and rims... This is ALMOST a paradise for any Carma fan. Almost, because of the negatives I mentioned earlier.\n\nConclusion\nIf you're a Carma fan and you have a Monster Rig or you don't care if you play on lowest settings: get this game.\nIf you are bother by those things, wait until the game is released or at least optimised for older computers (or invest in a new one), because right now I can't enjoy "Teh Grafics" and if you too have a 3/4 year old computer, you probably won't either... unless you bought a Monster Rig back then, then you won't have any problems...

A racing game where we drive over pedestrians to win? MADNESS! CRAZY! PROHIBITED!\n\nToday that is no longer really relevant, since we run over pedestrians in any GTA.\n\nClassic Karma is the one thing that seperates it.\n\nClassic Karma is a race against 5 computer opponents and a victory can be achieved via one of 3 possible events. First, of course, can be run and who arrives first at the finish the race ends with a win.. Then all enemies can be destroyed through various upgrades, crashes and weapons that we can pick up. And as a last option we can roadkill a certain amount of pedestrians to win. It makes no sense why one should win a race this way, but well‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a videogame.\n\nIt is this mode that made Carmageddon famous, hated, loved and unique. Now with Carmageddon Reincarnation in 2015 this unique race "fuuuuun" returns.\n\nBut unfortunately completely not in the quality that I would have liked.\n\nLet's talk about the elephant in the room: the performance. Maybe you've heard it from other YouTubers, but the game runs like a slide show. Not a particularly nice on if I might add. No matter what setting, all the way up or on minimal settings leads to around 30fps with my GTX 970 at the beginning of the race and after a few crashes or we eliminate a few pedestrians, received weapons or effects, the FPS falls down to about 10 fps.\n\nI would not be annoyed about it when it sometimes drops to 30 fps, but I know that even Totalbiscuit with his Titan X 2-way SLI system can‚Äôt play it smoothly, you just know that the game has extreme optimization problems. The load times are incredibly long and yes I do start the game from my SSD. You wait up to 60 seconds before the round starts.\n\nApart from that the game looks visually like slush, pedestrians are quite unrecognizable, but that could be the style of the developer, on the other hand the world is itself partly in terribly poor quality and the cars are compareable to graphics from 2009. Something that would not bother me if it would be at least with a constant smooth framerate.\n\nBecause the gameplay is really entertaining. The upgrades or weapons which can be obtained in a race are awesome! My favorite was the temporary transformation of my car in granite. An incredible destructive power. Or the ability simply to shoot an anvil out of the car: a hit and the opponent is broken. it is bonkers.\n\nOf course there is more than the classic Carmageddon. We also have Death Race, Ped Chase, Checkpoint Stompede and Fox ‚Äòn Hounds. Death Race should be obvious, we drive a race and can not win by destroying the enemy or kill pedestrians down en masse. Of course destroying opponents helps us because we get points that we can use to repair us, but in this mode, we must definitely win the race.\n\nThe Ped-Chase mode is similar to Chechpoint Stompede, it is designed that a pedestrian is selected at random and must be killed by the drivers. Whoever has 10 together won the race. Checkpoint stampede spawn single gates and must be driven through then. In both cases, by destroying an opponent a point will be taken from hin and you get it. Of course, this brings you more quickly to the goal of all 10 points.\n\nFox ‚Äòn Hounds was not played by me, as this mode is unlocked later in the game and I was just able to play the first half of the campaign missions. However, the mode works so you have to be marked as the fox and stay the fox for a time limit of 2 minutes. If you are being touched by an opponent, he becomes the fox and his time is running out. As the Gamespot reviewer says, the mode is a complete mess.\n\nThis is attached to the career, in free driving we can even still choose the map and the other setting options. In addition there is also a multiplayer mode ... the ... well .. it is there but there is just no lobby and I had no one with whom I could play together, so I can not say too much about it. After all, there are online and LAN matches.\n\nWhat I particularly like is the use of different worlds and how they are split up in the missions. Even if we repeatedly visit the same setting, the various tracks are designed so that we just stay in a different areas each time. So it does not feel like we have too little variation or lack of content.\n\nWhat I find unfortunate is that there is no story. In Carmageddon TDR 2000, there was at least a way to go through the state and perform tasks to further progress. In the first world, we had to break down a wall, activate a giant mechanical gorilla for which we had to collect material from mechanical sharks in a lake. Nothing wild, but at least something which is a story and not only gives us race after race after race.\n\nThe decision of a token system to upgrade our vehicles surprises as I think that a money-supported upgrade system is far better. Yes, you heard right, instead of gathering credits and boost your statistics, there are now tokens which you must find in the world, which is not too hard, and then you have to wait until you unlock the corresponding chapters to get a new part and then also be able to use with your token.\nI am honest, I don‚Äôt like it. Let us simply grind our credits and then upgrade our car. It‚Äôs not as if the game is difficult enough by a spongy control and the extreme FPS drops.\n\nSo let us summarize again: Carmageddon is a reasonably decent  game and almost worth your money considered the successor to the classic, if you can ignore fps drops ... and the half-baked Graphics ... and way to little options to set anything...\n\nand and and.\n\nYou see, I can not really recommend you the game. My hopes were to experience the old scenes again and after all, the name of the powerups were also identical to what we had in TDR 2000. The Pinball mode was awesome. Unfortunately, only the main town is well done as a map and all the others are more thematically but not interesting enough for crazy Carmageddon.\n\nBut still there are always moments that are just fun and clearly indicate what the Carmageddon series makes it different from other racing games. The gameplay is fun, but unfortunately repeatedly interrupted by extremely long load times and the extreme problems of performance and half-baked graphics.\n\nCarmageddon: Reincarnation is not recommendable as long as it has the poor performance.\n\nToo bad to see that this game is so poor in quality, after it has been funded on Kickstarter with 625.000$ on the 400.000$ goal and then even delayed a month later as it was some time in Steam Early Access.","June 6, 2015","false","10.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

However, while this does stay somewhat true to those games it also doesnt innovate in any way.  Racing games/controls/physics have come a long way and this game doesnt adopt any tech or quality of life improvements to the genre over the last 15 years.    This can be seen as good or bad by some.\n\nStraight to the point the game is about to come out of beta and has terrible issues with crash's.  I've crash's just for changing the key bindings.  Load times are slow, i have a 780 gtx and the new x99 chipset and the latest haswell E processor and 32 gigs of ddr 4 ram running it on solid state.  There is no reason for the load times, the game is hilariously badly optimized for something that has been developed for as long as it has.\n\nThis is further annoying because the game graphically looks like something that was released over 6-7 yeears ago.  I put everything on max settings and while my computer handles it I noticed several graphical artifacts like lines putruding out of buildings and strange graphical glitch's with the car parts.    They're not contant but they happen frequent enough to make you even more confused why the game is such a resource hog.\n\nHonestly i'm curious what the point of this game was.   If i wanted to play carmegeddon with outdated graphics and the same old sloppy handling and physics, i'd have just played the original carmegeddon games.   Glad to see they're trying to bring it back, but at this point i think another developer should have took over the series as some how over the last decade all they thought that could improve the game is multiplayer.\n\nSadly dissapointed, also I didnt play the game 39 hours, thats a glitch with steam and this game.  I ran several other games in that time, it just kept telling everyone i was in carmegeddon.....add that to the list of weird bugs with this game.   In short, want carmegeddon?  Go play the originals and save yourself the time on this.","April 14, 2015","false","37.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","3"

Yes, driving has similarities with previous games but not quite (played little oldies to verify). Given the car mass and acceleration such handling might be expected but Carmageddon is not the kind of game where I anticipate realistic simulation. Eventually after hours of practice you can master the fat cows on ice but it is not the entertainment to go back for occasional relaxing wrecking and mayhem. Where is the fun in not being able to hit anything you want, rather constantly spinning out of countrol. And it is not only handling what has suffered through too much realism but also overall game balance. Often the opponents are very aggressive and with weaker vehicle you are constantly wasted or your wheels are missing. Timed power-ups last not enough to do anything.\n\nThis game introduced some new game modes, those might be good for multiplayer but in single-player it felt like filling the lack of content. Original Carmageddon had no missions or challenges, the second game had one for every three ‚Äòclassic‚Äô levels, but current one has one to three ratio favouring challenges. Again, not fun.\n\nLots of reviews are pointing to technical issues. I tried it while it was Early Access and then it was real slide-show. Currently it ran smooth, loading times were bit long but some moving level physics like crusher plate threw everything skipping, also playback mode was unusably slow. There were other small issues but nothing annoying: level disappearing at certain camera angle, overlapping geometry, prop placements, etc. Some achievements are declared broken and cause multiplayer is pretty much dead, no way to get those achievements either.\n\nI think lot of people who spent hours or days in previous Carmageddons hoped to get something more. With no players there probably will be no viable modding community and custom content creation either.","August 15, 2015","false","73.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

That's less than a month away. At the moment of writing this, the game takes a LONG time to boot up. If it even boots at all. If you're lucky enough to get it running, you're then treated to an atrociously long load time before you can get into the first level. But hey, a long load time before the actual gameplay must mean we get a big open world to play around in, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nAll of the levels (that I played so far) are average-sized at best, and feel uninspired and bland. The few creative pieces of level design that are present, are ripped off from the original Carmageddon. And even those feel like a poor man's choice.\n\nBut come on, it's Carmageddon! Surely we can deal with some longer load times. After all, we've been waiting for so many years!\n\nThe thing is, this doesn't FEEL like a Carmageddon game, but rather like a cheap knockoff. Remember that sense of speed and accomplishment you got in the original, from racing down those long stretches of road, only to ram into a pedestrian or vehicle at over 200 mph? Well, don't expect any of that here. All of the cars feel incredibly slow, where even the faster models give you no sense of speed at all.\n\nBut then again, going over 200 mph in THIS game would be absolute suicide, since all of the cars seem to be made out of paper. The slightest nudge to your car will make your repair indicator go haywire. Your opponents' cars don't fare much better. All of the intensity that came with the battles in the original Carmageddon is gone in this one, simply because a little lovetap is enough to send most of your opponents out of commission.\n\nAlso, driving in itself is an absolute disaster. You'll spend more time trying to keep your car going in a straight line than anything else. Nudge your analog stick to the left or right? Be prepared to fight a long battle with your car in order NOT to crash it. There is little to no friction with the road.\n\nThe horrible driving mechanics are even more of a hassle because of the terrible, TERRIBLE optimisation. Be prepared for fps drops. A LOT of fps drops. At random. Don't you just love it when a supposedly fast-paced game decides to further screw you over by randomly freezing up for a few seconds in the midst of what little action there is?\n\nGame modes... The classic Carmageddon formula is here: Kill your opponents, kill all pedestrians or just do the race. Due to all of the reasons mentioned above, there's little enjoyment left in this once great formula. There are also some new game modes, which are completely unnecessary. Why add a race mode, when this is included in the "classic" mode? Basically, the game is saying "do classic mode, but we're taking away your choice in the matter and you have to do the racing thing that NOBODY EVERY DOES IN A CARMAGEDDON GAME". There's also a checkpoint mode, where you have to collect 10 checkpoints before the opponents do. Yes, it's exactly as stupid as it sounds.\n\nGraphically... meh. The game looks dated, with some very questionable texture quality at some places, and is plagued with invincible obstacles. Drive full speed into a bench? That bench will **** you up good and not budge an inch. But not all benches. Some of them are destructible. Some of them aren't. Feeling lucky? And there's a lot more of these where that came from.\n\nIt's a shame this game turned out the way it did. With less than a month before its official release, I don't see this becoming a worthy Carmageddon game in time. Maybe after a few (or rather, a lot) of updates, it might get there.\n\nBut right now? Save your time and money, and install DosBox with the original Carmageddon. That blows this disappointment straight out of the water.\n\n\n","March 24, 2015","false","1.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

This is not a normal circumstance. This game is literally everything that I wanted from the very first time I played the original oh so long ago.\n\nIt's crazy violent fun. The races aren't hard, but they ain't easy either. The only real complaint I have so far is that I wish that you got time bonuses for hitting the checkpoints in classic carma races. Freeplay mode means that I'll keep coming back for stress-free fits of road rage for a long time to come.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/asharwood/recommended/249380/","asharwood","ASHarwood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/asharwood/","235 products in account","11/4/2015 - The game is much more optomized. The loading times are a little better.  I clocked about a minute to load a map which is better than before.  The smoothness of the gameplay is much better and fps gains are great adding to the smoothness.  The graphics are also much more enhanced and better looking.  Classic gameplay.  If you love cars and destruction and an open world, this game is for you.\n\nLet's be honest right now.  As of 3/11/2015 at 11:31am est, this game is buggy as hell and not very optomized.  The graphics are horribly optomized.  You can't use bloom or AA without the game just going to a crawl and that is coming from a person with the specs (amd 8350 oc, nvidia 770 oc, 16gb ram, 512ssd).  If you put the graphics up it still doesn't look that good.  I actually found that removing the bloom, blur, dof, and others that it looks much better.  I enable AA in my nvidia control panel.\n\nThe game is horribly buggy.  At first I had to install a windows update for it to even run.  Then the very first match i tried to get into bugged me out to the desktop.  That was not a good sign.  Then the next match worked but boy did it take forever to get into. Like a minute or two to load and I am use to a few seconds with an ssd for my games.  I get into the game and the game runs well once it is playing.  The peds look great and so do the cars.  It plays very much like the games of the past which is what redeems the game itself.  That is what I was really looking for.  It's that "yea sure there is a course to run, but Imma go see what is on top of this building...let me get wall climber and speed boost and drive up there."  or the "Imma try and kill every ped in the game" or "lets just explore and see how much air time I can get off that ramp."  The open world, crazy powerups, crazy fun, car smashing chaos that you come to expect from the series.  It is still there alive and strong.  Very fun.  The sounds even bring you back to the days of ol' glory.  Tons of fun once you get it to play.\n\nTip: when loading just leave it be.  It takes a while but it will eventually load.  Don't start pushing buttons thinking it has crashed.\n\nIN THE END: If you don't mind some serious bugs trying to get the game started and love the classic carmageddon experience, buy the game.  The devs seem to be constantly working on it and will iron out the bugs...and if they don't I know without a doubt that the community will.","March 11, 2015","true","40.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

My hardware:\n\nAmd FX-8370 8 core 4ghz\nGpu: Nvidia Gtx 760 4Gb\nRam 16gb\nMb M5A97 R2.0\n\nSo this game run in 1980x1080 medium settings about 25-50fps max. So not nearly as good as it should run.\nBut the main question besides the awful performance, is this game any fun and is it good?\n\nWhen this game runs +45fps it's really a good game, reminds me a lot about old carmageddon, only with a better graphics and more destruction details.\n\nI can truly say that i like this game, despite it's runnning poorly. When you slam someone to the wall and see parts flying around, i instantly thing" Good old carmageddon"\n\nGameplay wise, this is the game we old carmageddon fans have been waiting for a long time, over the top powerups, fun gameplay and lots of peds to smash and run over. Couple new gamemodes, parts shop is back, and so are those hate or love polices :)\n\nAs how this game is running now, i would be hesitant to tell you to buy this right now, id wait for a patches and follow the community to see can developers fix fps issues or not.\n\nBut nevertheless this game IS GOOD as what is was meant to be, it stays true to old carmageddon series, which we all remember and love.\n\nId rate this game right now, with current performance issues at least solid 7/10 because this game has the potential to be fixed. And when and if this runs maybe after patching solid 60fps id definetly give this 9/10 and recommend this to my friends :)","June 8, 2015","true","8.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
