"http://steamcommunity.com/id/epilexia/recommended/397690/","epilexia","Epilexia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/epilexia/","691 products in account","Inspired by Space Invaders Infinity Gene, this lovechild from Tetsuya Mizoguchi’s Rez and Kenta Chao’s rRootage surpass in each of its 5 minutes songs the dazzling intensity found in an entire Cave shmup\nHeavily influenced in its design philosophy by Tetsuya Mizoguchi’s magnum opus Rez, HyperSpace Invaders II: Pixel Edition is a love letter to abstract japanese shmups such as Kenta Chao’s cult classic rRootage or Taito’s contemporary classics like Space Invaders Infinity Gene or Groove Coaster.\n\nAnd do you remember Half Minute Hero? In this game from japanese studio Opus, the premise was to doing a postmodernist retelling of a classic JRPG structure by synthesising all its mechanics in 30 frenzy seconds. HIII does something similar with the shooting genre. Each one of its 10 main levels is played individually with separate leaderboards. And each level is designed based on the structure of a musical track, transforming incorporeal sounds in fascinating musical allegories that talks about the overuse of drugs and the mysticism found in Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+’s neon glow corridors.\n\nWith the duration of each track running in the 3 to 10 minutes range, HIII does a magnificent work condensing in such a limited time frame the refulgent 0rgasm sensation of doing an entire 50 minutes loop in your all-time favorite shmup. Each song has a very different taste and feeling based on the pulsing tempo of its BPM. Sometimes, playing HIII is an experience similar to enjoy the classic approach of a Galaga derived shmup full of charisma and cheerful love like Eschatos. And in other occasions, it’s more close to play a Bullet Terror Hell Madness that occurs inside Michael Haneke’s perverted mind.\n\nThe key to express why HIII is an instant classic and one of the better shmups conceived in the last decade is the term Destruction. For years, the shooting games have been obsessed with the idea of putting more an more bullets on screen. In the mid-‘90s, this increase of the number of bullets on screen had a sense. It was a manner of breaking the technical limitations of its time period, pushing the hardware to make captivating and almost impossible dreams of the past come true. But with this race to increase the number of bullets on screen, comes a problem. In the last years a lot of shmups have focused its experience in the immaterial act of dodging bullets, rather than in the physical and sensitive pleasure of spreading the Chaos and Destruction causing a lot of things to explode.\n\nHIII is able to put put dozen of billion of bullets at the same time on screen. But it never lost its focus from the infinite pleasure of Destruction. And even its smart scoring system is centered around the idea of Total Destruction. Every single ship destroyed makes more an more powerful our main weapon. And we have an even more destructive secondary laser weapon that can trespass small bullets, clearing the screen of enemy fire. Because HIII is conscious that making a billion of things explode at the same time in an utopian chain while it burns our retinas with abrasive flashing lights, is much more fun that simply see some solitary bullets floating in the vastness and solitude of space.\n\nAfter decades of playing every single shmup classic, I can say that none other game has been able to equal the frantic sense of intensity and absolute level of Destruction found in HyperSpace Invaders II: Pixel Edition. And the proverbial idea of making of each track a full playthrough, highlights this captivating-senses joyful destructive feeling, fusing Eros and Psyche in a dazzling and cosmological 0rgasm. Condensing in 5 minutes runs the sense of realization of be able to complete an entire shmup classic. Distilling only the most intense and significative parts. And showing in every second the reasons we play videoagmes. The reasons we love videogames.\n\nAnd the random nature of each level and its adaptive level of difficulty, makes of each playthrough a completely new experience. Every time that you play HyperSpace Invaders II: Pixel Edition, you have this magic sensation of going to your favorite arcade in the 90s, seeing that a new shmup cabinet from Toaplan has arrived. This incomparable feeling of experimenting for the first time a completely new universe full of flashing lights and captivating electronic tracks. That comes packed with masterful bullet patterns and a perfect crafted scoring system.\n\nHyperSpace Invaders II: Pixel Edition is the most accomplished occidental shmup to date. That feels like one hundred of forgotten japanese classics in the same game.\n\n\n( The writer of this review is not an English native. So you should expect occasional grammar errors.

It has all the colours and then some more! It needs the mother of all photosensitive epilepsy warnings!\n\nI have a feeling my eyeballs are going to hate me tomorrow, but they love me today. Oh, they love me today!\n\nIf you look at the trailer, you will have no idea what's going on. At least, I didn't.\n\nWhat's happening is you're a little shooty thing that forever shoots upwards (autofire! nice and relaxing!), and all the hundreds of other things on the screen heading downwards are enemies, bullets and power-ups.\n\nAll you really need to pay attention to, in order to survive, is you need to not run into anything that's not a power-up. It's fairly simple; there are only two power-ups, and one of them are "souls" that auto-target you when you hit an enemy. Oh, and - you can move anywhere, you're not restricted to left and right. :)\n\nAs well as your autofiring gun, you can push the fire button to shoot a second gun. This gun kills (most) enemy bullets, and is powered by the souls I mentioned earlier.\n\nEach level lasts as long as the music that's playing in it. The idea is to shoot as many enemies as you can in that time, keep up a chain, and not get killed too much.\n\nSo - fun, simple, classic arcade-style mechanics, a challenge that seems *just right* (well, it scales up as you go through the levels, but it seems eventually doable), plus crazy visuals (this is an understatement!), good music, tight gameplay that doesn't give you a split second to blink - all makes for a great, exhilarating time!\n\nBut I think this is a game to play in short bursts.\n\nJust in case my eyes decide to go "you know what? this is too much! we quit!!". Haha!\n\nUPDATE: Just so you know, the next day arrived and I turned out not to be blind after all!","November 25, 2015","true","3.1"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","16","23","4","6"

Ended up not breathing for at least 2 minutes. I went into shock. As I fell to the ground all I saw was flashing lights and pixels coming at me at high velocity. After 3 minutes I had learnt there was no point in life that is why you are given 5. After dying around 30 times I decided maybe this is too fast which then lead me to think what the harder levels are like. My eyes oh god my eyes. Why? how? what did you think would happen if you added that many lights to one pixelated screen of tourcher.\nOver all I would give this game a 8/10 only missing 2 score as I cannot see anymore and it made me question life.","April 5","true","0.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","2","2","4","1"

The shmup-feel is good, difficulty curve is good, controls are fine. There is a mechanic where you can drain your drain your overall shot level to fire a laser that does high damage and also destroys enemy bullets. Except when it doesn't. Some enemy bullets are immune and I don't fully understand what the difference is yet. That and the fact that it can be difficult to know even what is going on, let alone pick up powerups and dodge bullets are my only two complaints. But the intense confusing hectic approach is part of what makes it a good experience, so I wouldn't want to change it. Now, just how hectic is this game?\n\nWell.\n\nAllow me to take you on a tangent: My favourite restaraunt is this Mongolian Grill place where you stack a bowl full of food of your choice, then add scoops of sauces at your choice before they  cook it for you. At the sauce selection station there is a peanut sauce, and I always get a scoop of peanut sauce. Not because I'm a huge fan of peanut, but because I know that some people are deathly allergic to peanut, so I feel like I should enjoy it just because they can't. Kind of like I am flaunting my "I am not deathly allergic to anything" privilege. Well, this game feels like I am flaunting my "I do not have epilepsy or a history of seizures" privilege.","April 5","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

If so, only purchase this game if you want to f*cking die. And I mean in real life.\n\nI'm not sure how long I played for before writing this review. I don't consider it a bad thing if it took me two minutes or thirty minutes to come to the conclusion that this is a psychotic rave party in outer space where dodging the things you're supposed to pick up is more than a bad idea: it's a fatal mistake.\n\nTouhou? Why the hell would I want to shoot anime girls when I could shoot a strange mixture between the ghosts from Pac Man and the aliens from Space Invaders without ever having to press a fire button even once?\n\nGreat music. Insane graphics, lights, explosions, space constantly. You won't know which end is up when you start playing, and by the time you've become comfortable enough in your new electro-trance strobe light home, you still won't know what's going on - only that your eyes hurt, your points are going through the roof, and everything is dying, including you. Something's different about this game though - I don't feel as if I'm punished when I die or even get game over. It just happened, and rolls off of me like it was just a natural part of the game. As someone super competitive and always out for the high score in games like this, that's never happened to me.\n\nClaims to have controller support but I can't get it to work.

The bullets are about as bright as everything else and the mess of colours makes it hard to keep track of where my ship is, and what to avoid. The powerups are noticeable, but I find myself accidentally avoiding them because I can't keep track of what they are. The game has potential, but it kills it overall for me because it wants to be flashier than it needs to be.\nThe game does some things right, like a "Bomb" mode, as I've called it, that allows you to get out of tight spots as a form of insurance.

The so called "music" that the other reviewers dribble on about is so annoying I had to remove my headphones within seconds of starting the game. Expect the same not repeated for 5 minutes without any real pattern.\n\nIn terms of the rest of the game: it is not only offensive to the ears, but painful on the eyes and it's not even fun to play.
