However, the further into the game, the more it's obvious that this game needed some more variety. Having such a large number of bosses with essentially identical behavior makes this game bland. The worst part for me is that sometimes I would have the right idea for how to beat a boss, but the mechanics wouldn't register the kill, so I'd try a bunch of other tactics...that also wouldn't work. Eventually, I'd YouTube the answer, and lo! it was the first thing I tried. WINNING MECHANICS NEED TO WORK ALL THE TIME.

When does the full game come out?\n\n\nI'll explain. The entire game is boss fights, but there aren't a whole lot of them. The only other gameplay element is wandering around a small world looking for bosses, which is just filler in an already exceedingly short game.\n\nTo their credit, the designers did well with the combat mechanic used. Unfortunately, they definitely started to run out of ideas. Some of the bosses are completely reliant on quickly hitting a small target in a split second opening, with attacks to avoid before you get the chance to do so.\n\nThe game also felt incomplete right from the start. After defeating every boss an over-the-top animation is played in which you absorb its soul, power, whatever. This does nothing and serves no purpose. It leads me to believe that it was supposed to do something, but the developers either ran out of time or didn't know how to make use of it. There is no character progression.\n\nThere is one moment of story in the entire game. Interestingly, it hints that by killing the Titan Souls you will gain knowledge or power, but as stated in the previous paragraph, nothing happens when you kill a boss.\n\nThe music is exceptionally strong, and is probably the strongest part of the entire game.\n\nThe quality of the artwork is high. The water and lighting effects are quite impressive, however the aesthetic is generic and uninspired. Though this is largely subjective, the main world has a standard overgrown monolithic theme, with an even more generic forest, lava cave, and frozen area. The open world aspect of the game again seems like it was intended to be something more, but somehow ended up as an afterthought.","April 18, 2015","false","3.6"," 736 of 969 people (76%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","76","736","969","14","3"

The game only contains bosses which makes it feel like a boss rush version of zelda with the difficultly setting turned up.\n\nTitan souls has amazing boss designs and themes. The OST is relaxing while tense at the right moments and a decent background noise to your conquest. The combat is straight forward and punishing for any mistakes.\n\nHowever this is in constrast with the overworld. There are only two or three spots where you need to interact with the overworld to find a boss (one of which being figuring out the map layout aka Zelda lost woods puzzle). There are a few "hidden" pathways that lead to shortcuts or hidden artwork. The game gives you zero reason to ever backtrack to an area so once you've finished killing the areas bosses which range from 2-3 in an area you never revisit the area.\n\nThere are only a few mechanics in the actual gameplay. Only a few bosses need to be killed in a special way while the rest are shoot in the butt/eye.\n\nI would gladly pay 60$ for fleshed out version that contained actual puzzles, overworld enemies and powerups. Currently it only took me 3ish hours to complete and I don't feel inclined to replay using any of the extra modifiers.\n\nOverall a decent experience but not worth 15$.

I can tolerate hyper difficult games.  I enjoy them for the most part.  But when I see poor game mechanics implimented in games, I have to be honest and explain WHY they are poor choices.  At the time of this review, I have now not only completed the game on normal difficulty, but I have done the new game+ (HARD) version.  To this point I am going off my experiences through the entire game, including the last boss fight.\n\nThis game is difficult, there are no beans about that.  Unfortunately, alot of the difficulty is not based on the challenge alone.  It is a game that tries your patience, over your skill (I will explain this in a bit).  These are reasons why I feel that I cannot unilaterally recommend this game, and I have to give it a thumbs down.  It is clearly not for everyone, and in more ways that one, I find that it is not entirely enjoyable for me, especially not for the price tag involved with the game (15 American Dollars).\n\nSo that being said, lets break down what the game does right:\n\n1)  The graphics: THe game looks good.  The pixel art is fun, and enjoyable.  The style is fine, and the world looks good.\n2) The sound:  The sound effects are not an ear sore.  They are appropriate and engaging, so no complaints there.  The music is excellent, and one of the reasons to pursue the sound track.  With an exception of some odd choices (one of the bosses has a "metal" sounding rock anthem, which is distinctly OUT OF PLACE with the rest of the game.  Not a bad piece of music, just seemed out of place in my opinion.\n3) Gameplay: What you get in this  title is a solid two button experience, that ends up being a remarkably solid experience (bad and good)  If you can stomach is the problems with the game, you will be treated to a very stable experience.\n\nNow those three things are not inherently bad, and can lend you to an fun time.  The problems with the game however, outway these good things.  So lets dig into what I have problems with.  Understand, that while this may seem nit-picky, I will argue that it is not.  The things that this game does wrong, are damn near game breaking in their simple essence.\n\n1) Your one method of attacking in this game renders you immobile, as does your button activated retrieval of your weapon.  This game is all about mobility.  The bosses are relentless in their assaults, and you need to keep moving to prevent getting killed.  Now, I understand that the game is designed with this problem in mind, but that does not change the fact that the problem is a problem regardless.  From a design perspective, there is no reason NOT to allow movement while charging your attack to release, nor is there a legitimate reason to prevent movement while retrieving your weapon.  This "freeze and charge your weapon" mechanic is out dated, and serves to add a "frustration" element to the games difficulty, as opposed to legit skill based difficulty.  Again, don't get me wrong, I understand that the timing is technically skill based.  The bottom line is that this mechanic is largely frustrating, will probably be the #1 cause of deaths in the game, and really should have stopped being used in games a long time ago.  Unless the characters weapon is an English Longbow that requires him to take a knee to fire (which NONE of the concept art would alude to), there is no reason he cannot walk and draw the bow at the same time, even if it slows his movement down.\n\n2) There is absolutely NO reward system for this game.  There is no player growth.  There is no score, there is no story.  There is literally NOTHING that motivates the player to do what they are doing beyond the simple idea of trying to do it faster than you did the last time.  (achievements do not count in this regard, I know they are there, but I am talking about the core game not tacked on challenges for bragging rights.)  This is great for speedrunners, but no so good for pretty much EVERYONE ELSE, especially considering the game (on the easiest difficulty) requires frame perfect execution of technique that spans a window of .65 seconds to actually terminate a boss in some cases.  Having trouble with an annoying boss?  There is no way to out level the challenge, and no way to give you any more advantage beyond continuing your struggle and hoping that the cards finally fall into your favor during the fight so you can get the perfect kill.  This cripples the games accessability to a large portion of an audience that would otherwise play this game, much less pay the 15 dollar initial asking price.  Part of the challenge is identifying the way to beat a boss... the rest of actually managing to pull off what is required to do it.  The game is also at least 20 minutes long from start to finish.  While the lack of complexity is actually refreshing in a way, I unfortunately feel the impact on my enjoyment alot more due to the other issues with the game, like... -\n\n3) This game instantly kills you.  There is no health bar, when you are hit you are dead.  Now this in of itself is not a bad thing.  This is a great mechanic, especially when the same thing happens to the bosses when you hit their weak spot.  What hurts this mechanic is the lack of ability for the character to just instantly repeat the fight.  Under most situations in the game, the save point is close to 45 to 1 and a half minutes away from the boss.  Now this may seem quick and trivial, but understand that it is possible to die in some bosses within 5 seconds of the boss fight starting.  This adds up, and not in a good way.  One concept to understand in level design, and gameplay, is that of "Player morale".  You want your player, despite difficulty, to keep pressing forward to try and overcome the challenge, without driving them away.  This game has no concept of this reality.  There were several boss fights that I initially found fun, but after spending close to 15 minutes TOTAL in walking from the save to the boss in between fights, I found that my entertainment was wearing thin.  There are so many other games before this one that have shown the proper way to do this (including Shadow of the Collossus) that I do not understand WHY they decided to impliment this annoying delay in progress.\n\nIn closing, I can forgive the ball busting, totally devestating frame perfect difficulty that this game's normal mode offers.  I can even find myself enjoying it.  I find it cool that there are other modes to unlock after you manage to complete the game including a harder new game plus, among other modes to extend your game time.   I am, however, a mixed bag of opinions, because part of me finds the rest of this game fun, and there really are only three major problems that are holding this game back from greatness.   I doubt the game will ever be patched to fix these issues, and should by miracle, the developers actually take advice and fix the problems, I will be willing to re-visit this review.  As it stands though, this game is not only, not for everyone, but I find that I am hard pressed to even recommend the game to fellow hardcore gamers like myself.  The game mechanics are just that, the game is designed around them, and if you are willing to ignore, and or cope with them like I am, then you may find something enjoyable in this game.  But like it or not, just because you design a game around bad game mechanics, does not make those game mechanics any less annoying and terrible.  Gold plated poop is still poop.  The devs had me excited for this game for quite some time, and watching people play the game who have overcome the limitations can be very fun to watch.  But playing the game is a whole different story, and I can only recommend investing in this title when it is for 5 american dollars or less.","April 14, 2015","false","10.4"," 1,025 of 1,397 people (73%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","73","025","1","15","54"

While it certainly was hard, and had interesting and thought provoking music/artwork, overall it felt very lacking. For the 15 dollars this game costs(13 for me because I preordered it), you will not get very much out of the game, and what replay value it does hold is packaged into some "game modifiers," which are really just a gimmicky way to get you to replay the game(no rolling, slightly more difficult bosses, etc.). The most frustrating thing about this game was not the bosses, but rather the extremely frustrating speed at which you move. Even with rolling, certain bosses will take at least half a minute to reach, just to be beaten in 5 seconds over and over again.\n\nIn addition to the frustrating movement mechanics, much of the fighting is just repeating the same thing over and over again until you get lucky enough to time the arrow exactly correctly. Much of the exloring is just walking around in circles at a incredibly slow speed until you find the right direction to go, and then hold down an arrow for 2 minutes so that you can walk up stairs. If you really enjoy boss figts, I would suggest looking into this game and perhaps buying it when it is on a steam sale. For those who looked at this game and thought that it would be awesome because of the artwork, etc., then I would reccomend rethinking buying it, and if you do buy it, do so when it goes on sale. Overall, not a particularly bad game, I am just a little dissapointed with the lack of content. 7/10.","April 14, 2015","false","3.4"," 825 of 1,129 people (73%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","73","825","1","8","11"

It is a boss fight game (there are no common mobs; only bosses) with minor exploration elements, and very simple (yet solid) mechanics. The boss fights (the core of the game) are quite varied and interesting. There are a couple bosses hidden away to find as well (well only one is really hidden). The pixel art suits it very well and the music is good (although you have to intentionally drag out boss fights to hear most of it in game).\n\nAlso keep in mind that despite the simplicity of the gameplay, the difficulty may deter people looking for a more casual experience.\n\nI just cannot recommend it based on the current price tag ($14.99 USD). There is some replayability in the unlockable modes (mainly the iron man mode). You can get maybe 30 minutes worth of extra fun by secret searching and unlocking the secret mode as well. There just isn't enough content outside of a couple replays to justify the price. I personally wouldn't value the game at more than $8 USD.\n\nThe main factor in how long the game takes to complete is player skill. You can complete the game in less than 20 minutes (and even get an achievement for it). Even if you do everything possible in a single playthrough it can still be done in less than 40 minutes. If you die a lot the main game will probably take about 4 hours.\n\nFor achievement collectors the only time consuming achievements would be the iron man achievments. These could take quite a long time to achieve due to the difficulty of staying alive in the game.\n\nI should point out that some of the achievements can be be quite fun if you enjoy a challenge. I especially enjoyed the bomberman achievement. Though, I felt like an idiot for not figuring it out sooner. If you enjoy hunting challenging achievements and intend to spend a lot of time trying to clear iron mode, then you should factor that into whether or not the price tag is right for you. You will get a lot more playability out of this game than those of us who don't care about achievements that much. It may even be worth $15 USD.\n\nThe game has no character progression outside of unlockable modes (one of which is a character regression). Because of this, the unlockable hard mode has no reason not to be unlocked at the start of the game (outside of the developers wanting to artificially extend replayability).\n\nI should point out that things like unlockable hard modes negatively affect my view on a game (only justified when the hard mode is intended to be a NG+ scaled experience with character progression E.G. Borderlands or Phantasy Star Online). Do not lock away difficulty modes behind conditions, developers! A player should have the right to make the game as challenging as they want right from the start.\n\nI did enjoy the game despite the reasons above. If the price goes down or you find it on sale I highly recommend you give it a shot. I just cannot advise you to buy it for more than 8 dollars (USD).","April 16, 2015","false","7.1"," 497 of 673 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","497","673","3","4"

I really enjoyed the boss fights as bite-sized challenges, like a sudden-death Zelda boss rush. The art is simple, but very effective and consistent, and everything runs well and plays smoothly and responsively, as expected. I give it a "wait for a sale," though, since there are two major problems I have with the game that make it not worth buying right now:\n\n1) There are 18 titans in the game (thanks Hazmatt) and if you beat them all before finishing the game you get one more secret fight. YMMV but for me that translated to less than two hours total (final time was 1 hour 54 minutes), at least half of which was walking around the surprisingly large, totally empty landscape. Also, unless you want to try challenges like a no-death run or a no-roll run, there's very little replay value, which is to be expected, but which would have been helped if the actual content was more robust. And no, unlike SotC, you can't replay fights from dead bosses for a time trial or just for fun. In addition, there's very little story, and what is there is highly abstract and vague, which is intriguing, but at the same time again diminishes its content. When all's said and done, for $15 it's just not enough value. For $10, maybe, but even that's stretching it.\n\n2) The interface is minimalist, which is nice, but it also removes crucial information in a game like this. Namely, when your roll delay is up. If you roll, you can't roll again for a period of time, but in order to know that period of time, you just need to memorize and get used to it. In a tense fight, it can frequently feel like you got cheated into a death because your roll wouldn't respond. An audio cue or something would have eliminated that issue.","April 14, 2015","false","2.0"," 655 of 900 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","655","900","6","6"

There were a few things about the game I honestly really quite like, but there's a few things that really irk me. To describe the game in general, think of Shadow of the Colossus, but Boss Rush form.\n\nI think one of the best things about this game is the concept and designs of the bosses I've faced so far. They seem to be well designed, and innovative. And the idea that you have one arrow, and one arrow alone, is pretty cool. You have to really take care with your shot. Miss and you'll have to call it back, which leaves you exposed, or you run to pick it up, if it hasn't landed somewhere out of reach. It made me feel like I needed to be more disciplined with my shots in order to beat the boss I'm facing. On top of that, the controls feel nice and smooth, not very clunky, which makes fighting each boss more fun. On top of that, I really love the music. So far the music definitely fits each area and boss pretty well, and it seems to be really good to match the pacing of the fight.\n\nHowever, on the flip side, the game feels... Lacking. You literally have to travel to each boss room, and fight the boss. You get a flashy cutscene of getting their soul, and then that's it. You just proceed to the next room. There's no sort of ability gain from it, no sort of achievement, it's over and you move on. I'm the type of person who likes the feeling of knowing I achieved something useful for defeating a tough boss, to help me improve my character for late game. On top of that, there's no regular enemies. Now, I can understand if that was deliberate, but the area I'm in could have potential to have some enemies lurking around until I defeat the bosses of that area. Just to keep me on my toes.\n\nI'm going to continue with the game, and try to complete it at least once. Although I can see that it has serious potential, it's just not for me.\n\nTL;DR, Bosses are pretty awesome so far, but doesn't feel like beating them was worth the amount of deaths and re-running to the rooms. You may want to wait until this game goes a little cheaper.","April 15, 2015","false","2.2"," 561 of 770 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","561","770","5","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/297130/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","This game looks like Shadow of the Colossus, and presents itself like Shadow of the Colossus.\n\nIt is not Shadow of the Colossus.\n\nThat is not to say that this game isn’t unique; it definitely is unique.\n\nBut unique does not mean good.\n\nThe heart and soul of this game is wandering around the game world taking out titans. Each of them has their own arena, and there are 19 of them in total.\n\nThis sounds like a boss rush. But it really isn’t. The reason is that the gameplay mechanics of this game are very strange.\n\nAs a 2D game, you run around laterally. You really only have two abilities – the ability to roll and the ability to shoot your arrow. Note that is arrow, singular – you shoot ONE arrow. If you miss with it, you need to retrieve it to shoot again. This means either walking over it, or holding down the fire button to draw it back to you. Drawing back your bow to fire or summoning your arrow back both immobilize you as long as you’re doing it, and firing your arrow is not instantaneous and can be done with varying amounts of power.\n\nYour character dies in one hit; if anything hits you, you die. The only things which don’t instantly kill you are a poison cloud (which kills you after a couple seconds) and some spores (which mess with the gameplay interface, and will kill you if you walk through too many of them). Both of these things appear in exactly one titan fight. Otherwise, if you get hit, you’re dead.\n\nWhen you die, you respawn at a nearby checkpoint. Note that this is not actually in the room with the titan, and in some areas, you actually have to do a fair bit of walking to get back to the titan  – not a ridiculous amount, but there are definitely a few areas where this is a bit wearing.\n\nThe main reason why this game is so weird is that the titans themselves are very weak – they are really, really, really good at killing you, but most of the titans can be killed with a single shot from your bow. This means that many of the titans, once you figure out how to beat them, can be killed in under 30 seconds – and many can actually be killed in under 10 seconds.\n\nThe problem is that you probably won’t do this the first time. You’re likely to die. A lot. I died 218 times on my way through this game. Almost all of your time spent playing this game is time spent dying.\n\nThe game, then, is basically you setting up for the perfect shot, and then executing on it successfully once to win the encounter.\n\nSome of the titans do require a bit more doing than this – some of them require multiple shots to kill in various capacities. Ironically, most of these titans are actually easier than many of the one-shot titans simply because they tend to be less lethal, and therefore, easier to fight. One of the first titans you fight is an ooze which splits repeatedly, and it is one of the easier titans despite requiring by far the largest number of shots of any titan in the game. It is also one of the only titans which actually feels like a “boss fight”. However, most of the rest of these titans are just about executing on a short series of things, usually 2 shots, or some sequence you must do to expose the boss’s weak spot.\n\nThe net effect of all this is that, rather than feeling like you’re beating down a bunch of badass bosses, instead it feels like you’re facing off with a bunch of heavily twitch-based scenarios – almost all of the fights are not about figuring out what you need to do (this is generally obvious), but actually executing on it. The few titans which are harder to figure out what to do against tend to be the most frustrating, as you don’t even know if you’re “doing it right” until something you try actually works.\n\nBecause so many of these fights can be over so quickly, really it is basically banging yourself against the wall that is the titan until you get your one perfect shot, at which point you win and it is off to the next one. This can make some parts of the game feel very short indeed – if you quickly kill a titan, it feels very ephemeral.\n\nAnd the reality is there isn’t anything else here for you. There are the nineteen titans, and that’s it. That basically means that this is a game which fundamentally contains 19 pieces of content, and all of the gameplay is centered around beating these 19 mostly twitch-based pieces of content.\n\nAfter that, you’re done with the game forever and never need to touch it again – and probably don’t want to, as the titans really don’t feel that satisfying to fight. Rather than being impressive enemies, they’re just twitch challenges. The only one that really felt all that exciting to me was the very final (secret) boss, who was pretty fun to look at and by far the most visually interesting foe in the game.\n\nThere is no real story to speak of – there are maybe three or so vague hints throughout the game, but you really have absolutely no idea whatsoever why it is you’re doing the thing you’re doing. It is implied that your arrow is somehow special, but why are you trying to drain the souls of all these titans?\n\nWho knows. And frankly, who cares? The game does nothing to make you feel like you’re part of a story; it is very gamish, and the vague attempt at profundity comes off as just that – a pretentious stab at relevance.\n\nIf you are all about twitch-based challenges, and enjoy dying repeatedly while attempting them… there are still much better games for you. This game was an interesting experiment, but I can’t recommend buying it. If you own it already, it might be worth taking a glance at it just for its oddness, but you aren’t really missing anything - just 3-4 hours of your life you won't get back.","February 7","false","4.3"," 227 of 295 people (77%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","77","227","295","8","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chrissums/recommended/297130/","Chrissums","Mrrchrissums","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chrissums/","285 products in account","This game is worth $5. maybe $10. heres why:\n\nThe bosses are waaaay less interesting than the art would have you believe. I have so far only encountered about 3 decent designs out of maybe 10 bosses that ive fought and they were all just rip offs of classic monster tropes anyway. Every other boss has been either a cube or a circle.\n\nGameplay: Every boss is either comically easy, or stuffed with artificial difficulty. There was only one boss I thought was genuinely well thought out. The "artificial difficulty" flavour in this game is: Relying on the Boss to position itself in such a way that it becomes possible to hit or kill.\n\nWhat I mean is, so far the bosses ive died the most to have been ones where you just need to try and try again and again until the boss' AI positions itself in an area where hitting it becomes possible. 1 Boss you could kind of direct it a little (which i wont describe because of spoilers) but even that one was largely luck that both things you need to hit would be on screen at the same time. They arnt hard bosses, If I was just trying to survive, I could do it practically forever, the problem is that killing them requires so much waiting and waiting that even knowing the trick doesnt help.\n\nAlso SPOILERS In the third area theres a boss that is just straight up an immobile wall, and the "fight" is walking a really long path that starts at a hidden door. Thats it. No hazards, no tricks, not even a maze or something. Just bump agaisnt a wall until you find the door, walk 2 minutes to the boss, and shoot it once in its immobile eyeball. Pathetic. Lazy, and amateurish.\n\nWhile the game is visually impressive, theres not a lot going on in terms of set pieces. Most of the area is just kind of blank. some trees, some rocks. nothing interesting. Theres a few little story hint set pieces here and there, but they are fairly vague and im not VaatiVidya or anything so I cant figure it out.\n\nIm very, very dissappointed considering I paid full price. If it goes on sale 50% off, pick it up. its worth a lark. but nearly $16.99 for a 200mb game full of lazy boss battles and no story? No thank you.","April 16, 2015","false","2.1"," 439 of 600 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","439","600","0","10"

The underwater worm boss, the ice guy with the teeth, the mushroom boss, etc, etc. Hitting them is way more about lucky timing than skill.\n\nWhere's the epicness in this game? Run around like a mad man, avoiding pretty obvious obstacles, then try to stand in the perfect spot while powering up your arrow. It's just not all that engaging.\n\nSome bosses are just annoying. Hitting the Yeti is frustrating. I landed many strikes that should have been hits but just bounce off. While other bosses seem too easy to hit. What gives?\n\nYes, there are some puzzles, but man they are really weak. The reentrant maze for the mushroom forest guys, lighting the fires, very very light weight.\n\nAs a thot exercise, imagine Mega Man with no jumping, just a dash move, one bullet and one hit bosses, nothing else. But, with loads of running, and running, and running. Would that be fun? I really don't think so.\n\nAt first blush it seems like an interesting idea, but upon further reflection it just isn't.\n\nThe whole concept is just too darn minimal. That adrenaline rush I normally feel when fighting a boss in say Dark Souls, Mario, Zelda, Metroid, Ninja Gaiden, etc., just isn't there, and the satifaction I normally feel when defeating a boss isn't there either. I have yet to feel like I really figured out a boss, because their mechanics are so darn obvious I know how to defeat them in the first few seconds (there's nothing to figure out). Forcing the player to run around isn't epic, it's frustrating. The depth of the gameplay is far too shallow to ever be more engaging than a long drawn out checklist.\n\nSorry, still a big thumbs down for me.\n\n5/10 (for the graphics, score and atmoshphere)\n\n(Killed the first 4 bosses, about 20 mins in. Decided to leave some early impressions.)\n\nTitan Souls is a very interesting thought exercise. What if an adventure game just had bosses? Big world to run around, lots of stuff to look at, but nothing else in the way of challenging adventure style gameplay. No enemies, no items, no locked "doors" that need a certain "key". Just bosses. Interesting yes, but is it actually enjoyable?\n\nOverall the game is well crafted, great score, sound fx, animations, art style, and I don't mind the controls (some people seem to hate them).\n\nWhat I can't seem to get over is just how much better this would have been if there were challenges along the way to the bosses. The world is just screaming for little puzzles, things I can collect, enemies to overcome. The adventure to the boss, I've come to realize, actually makes the boss fight better. It’s not just a fight with a monster, it's the final crescendo after all your hard work. A chance to show off your skills by having them pushed to the max by a worthy opponent.\n\nThis "missed opportunity" is so palpable that it's actually distracting me (really really distracting me) from enjoying the  game. When I climb down a vine into a pool of water, I want to feel smart for noticing that you can climb on vines. Maybe I get an item that opens up new gameplay possibilities, or some kind of upgrade for my hero, or I get to face off against a rare mini boss, or the game tells me why the heck these Titans are here. Something, anything, to feel like exploration is something more that a gigantic ball of catnip.\n\nInstead of making me feel smart and engaged, the game feels like one big tease. It's as if I'm running around Disney land, but only a few rides are working, there's no Mickey, no Goofy, nothing, the entire bloody park is absolutely deserted. Sure fighting a boss is kind of fun, but afterwards I have to go back to deserted-Disney only to be teased yet again by places  I want to explore (but known there isn’t a point), places I’d love to encounter a puzzle (but soon realize I never will), places I’d love to battle some enemies (but come to the crushing realization that they’re all on strike, or eaten by titans, or sick, or who the heck knows).\n\nClearly the game is inspired by Shadow of the Colossus. I think SotC got away with the “boss only” model because (1) it was stunningly presented, (2) it was extremely novel for its time, and (3) the bosses felt alive in addition to effectively being a big level with unique challenges, puzzles to figure out, multiple weakness points, etc.\n\nThe hyper minimalism of TS has just been pushed too far. It’s just too bloody empty!\n\nI knew going in that it was all about bosses, and although they are fairly challenging, they're just not enough to carry an entire game. In order to "just have bosses" they need to be of the same class as say a Punch-out! opponent. Super rich mechanics, tons of personality, lots of different ways to defeat them. The bosses in TS don't even come close to that bar. They’re extremely flat, - a gimicky mechanic wrapped in some decent pixels. You don't get carried away by them, deeply want to beat them, they don't taunt or mock you, or drive you to be faster, smarter, better. It’s sad, but they actually feel more like items on your todo list, then the Titans they're supposed to embody.\n\nFor $15 dollars, with very minimal production values, that just not good enough.\n\nI'll probably give it another go, and update this review after taking down a few more "Titans", but for now I leave feeling let down, and actually kind of ripped off :|.","April 15, 2015","false","2.0"," 541 of 762 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","541","762","4","11"

This game tried to take both Shadow of the Colossus and Dark Souls and mash them with some indie pixel art style. And it just doesn't work.\n\nIn order to be Shadow of the Colossus, you need a compelling story, and bosses who's weak spot is hard to find or get to. In order to be Dark Souls, you need tactile, intense, responsive and tight combat.\n\nThis game has neither of those so far. The story bit, I'm not sure if it kicks up later or if you are always a little girl with an arrow and no other purpose, but the combat is sloppy and slow. Rolls seem to have variable speeds, you can't move while aiming an arrow, and you can't cancel an arrow with a roll.\n\nThe art direction is poor at best, and all bosses I've fought so far, and all bosses seen in trailers and gameplay footage have similar mechanics, and similar designs. Shoot the arrow into the big glowing part on the bosses one of four bits, or just the one bit anywhere on the boss.\n\nI'll admit, I had fun with the first boss, but when I moved to the frozen brain, and realized the fight was similar I got worried. When the third boss and the gate keeper boss were similar I got tired of it.\n\nOverall, I would not reccomend to anyone that is looking for anything new. If you want the same, overly hard, pixel art game you've played before, I would reccomend it then.\n\nUpdate after playing for an hour:\n\nTurns out I was wrong on one thing, you can roll cancel arrows. I've beaten the game now, and hard mode doesn't appear to change much. There was no story to speak of, and frankly no reason to ever pick this game up again. There was zero progression of any sort, or any improvements to the gameplay. Overall, maybe worth an hour if you're good at games, a few hours if you're bad. If you have to absolutely buy this game, wait till a sale, otherwise it's not worth the disk space.\n\nWhich is sad, I was really hoping for more after playing the demo and watching trailers and other footage.","April 14, 2015","false","1.1"," 618 of 875 people (71%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","71","618","875","7","5"

Who wouldn't think that sounds intriguing? I was really excited, and I like hard games a lot. When I started playing the game, I think it's one of the worst designed games I've played in years, and I had to put it down pretty quickly. It's presumptuous that the developers seem to think this will be a popular game for speedrunning, because the game needs tons of improvements before it would even be fun.\n\nThe biggest thing that I hated was your weapon. You have only a bow, and press X to charge a shot. Not only does the camera move confusingly when you do this (making it difficult to aim precisely), but you actually have to continue holding X for your arrow to *return* to you. This completely and utterly breaks the flow of the boss fights, as you constantly have to find small windows of "doing nothing" so that you can retrieve your arrow. I feel like this mechanic was put in solely for the uniqueness factor, and nobody seemed to think about whether this actually made the player feel "cool" when fighting all these bosses. Shadow of the Colossus made me feel *awesome* -- I was climbing these huge, hairy beasts, hanging on for dear life. In this game, 3/4 of my time was spent scurrying around and retrieving my arrows. Not exactly the same feeling.\n\nAbsolutely everything about the game has these tiny, aggravating design problems. Death animations are long, and elevator animations are longer. Respawn points aren't right by the boss you were just trying, so it takes a minute or more to just get back to the boss you were fighting (even after dying in as little as 2 seconds). The arrow moves so fast that you can't even see it fly through the air, just where it lands. Bosses also have one health, so when you beat them it feels more like dumb luck than you actually having mastered their mechanics. The overworld is huge and has no map, and it's way too difficult to just find bosses to fight. You can't charge a bow shot while moving. You can't dash unless you roll first. Rolling has a short cooldown that doesn't match up with the animation and isn't indicated in any way. You can't roll up stairs, and it halts your movement if you even try. Basically, each and every one of these little things decreased my enjoyment of the game, and one of them was the straw that broke my tolerance.\n\nAll of this adds up to a game that *seems* like it should be absolutely stellar, but I beat about eight of the bosses and couldn't stomach having to sit through one more death animation or one more cycle of missing an arrow, then waiting helplessly until I could find a window just so I could retrieve it and attack him again.\n\nPlease do not buy this game. The saddest thing in the world to me is an amazing idea with awful execution.","April 15, 2015","false","0.7"," 491 of 690 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","491","690","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/297130/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Titan Souls is a top down action adventure game. The game was released on PC, PS4 and the Vita in April 2015.  Titan Souls is surprisingly not as popular on Steam as I would of initially thought, coming in at approximately 50k owners.\n\nGame play in Titan Souls is focused on your character, you carry a bow and one arrow. Yes, saw correctly, one arrow. You can also only take one hit from enemies before you die. Each enemy in turn only needs one hit in order for you to defeat it, the difficulty comes from finding out how best to be able to get that one hit in though. Some bosses will be encased in ice,  goo, or just generally a pain in the backside to nail down.  You are able to fire your bow more than once obviously, but each time you fire, you either have to retrieve your arrow from the ground by walking over to it, or to draw it back to you with your special power.  I have never seen this type of gameplay mechanic done in a game before, so it was nice to see something different.\n\nGraphically, Titan Souls takes on the ever growing common theme of the pixel style. Due to this game being so focused on the game play rather than breathe taking visuals, the graphics don't really matter that much - that being said, it does have a very charming look to it. All of the titans and character models all look well designed and flushed out. Animation of your character and the bosses is also very well done too - no weird looking movements or anything out of place, it just looks polished up.\n\nThe game does not go into much detail about the story and plot, it is just a generic background, your hero goes in search for power and must defeat the bad guys yada-yada-yada. Nothing really mind blowing, but again, this title is purely focused on the game play elements rather than anything else.\n\nTitan Souls is a very difficult release; this is another game where I had to consult the Wiki for guidance on a lot of bosses (Titans) for me to beat them, and even then I struggled due to just how hard the bosses are.  Upon looking up the achivements, there is one for completing the game in less than 20 minutes - I honestly don't see how that is possible given the amount of traveling between bosses, and the fights themselves. I managed to complete the game in just about four hours. I felt this to be a good length for the game; I was sufficiently pleased with how the game ended and I wouldn't be surprised to see the developers either release an update with more bosses, maybe a new game mode, or some DLC to add a couple more hours of gameplay in.\n\nThe game also strongly recommends the use of a controller, and I would have to ditto that statement, the game is hard enough on a controller, never mind about handicapping yourself using a keyboard to play. The controls are simple on the controller and you'll have picked them up in less than ten seconds, so it's definitely the way to go.\n\nI am going to strongly recommend Titan Souls, as it is a really nicely put together game, that will really test anyone out there who classes themselves as an avid gamer. All of your past knowledge of gaming will be put to the test here in the various different ways you need to take down bosses. I feel like the game is priced well too; at £10,99 you are getting probably five hours or so of content (give or take) of some really solid game play, if you can pick it up on sale then you will have yourself a proper bargain.\n\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Played the original game jam version when it came out, and loved it. I am a big fan of difficult games, and I enjoy a bit of rage-inducing challenge and the subsequent payoff. The art and music is beautiful, and the bosses are imaginative.\n\nHowever, there's something just off about the mixture in Titan Souls that keeps me from enjoying it. In a game relying on split-second decisions, your character needs to feel responsive and movement skillful. Instead, we are given a just-slightly-too-slow protagonist and a just-shy-of-tight set of feedback. I didn't come away from a successful titan kill feeling skillful, or that I had finally got it right - I felt like I finally got lucky. I had figured out what I needed to do many lives before, but was constantly frustrated that I couldn't make my character do what I was trying to make him do. I didn't overcome the boss, I overcame the controls.\n\nThe game is also extremely short given the price point. This i can forgive - the level of detail in each boss fight, and the unique aspects of each one justify an unusual development effort to game length ratio.\n\nMost games that give me difficulty also keep me going. I want to reach the end, and the more angry I get, the more I can't wait for just one more shot. Titan Souls had those moments, but as it went on... I wasn't angry, or excited; finishing the game was an obligation, and I was just glad to be done with it.","April 25, 2015","false","3.8"," 166 of 221 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","166","221","4","2"

I just have to say no.\n\nThe main reason for this is - boredom. The main overworld is completely empty and shallow, there's absolutely no fun in walking. Kind of like Shadow of the Colossus, which I love, but with the key difference that in SoC travelling, though also a little boring, overall was an EXPERIENCE! You rid your horse, learned it's mechanics, hunted down some chameleons and fruits along the way and when you were ready, you got to the boss.\n\nIn titan souls, you follow a path until you get somewhere. And you do this VERY SLOWLY. It takes so much time going anywhere, and you never have any idea if the direction is even right. This sucks.\n\nSecond drawback is that there is absolutely no sense of improvement. You go boss. You kill boss. You go next boss. You gain NOTHING through defeating them, no skills, no levels, no extra health. And because the developer thought the game wouldn't need a story, you don't even have a story progression to give you the feeling that any of what you do matters.\n\nNow the last thing I didn't like: it's boredom again, but this time WHILE your fighting a boss. The game is crafted to make you die a lot. In fact, about 2 to 40 times per boss minimum on your first playthrough. And EVERY DAMN TIME you have to walk to the boss again. Trigger it again. Watch is boring-♥♥♥ intro clip play out again. - and then you can finally fight.\nThat's what put me off the most - waiting.\nI mean, I understand the general purpose - it gives the player something to fear, so dying doesn't feel completely meaningless. ... and of course, it effectively quadruples the play time, so nobody notices the abstinence of anything fleshed out within the game itself.\nBut its just unbearable, you don't feel any kind of improvement even in your skills at playing, you just walk to the boss, over and over, generally try roughly the same tactics, until in 1 of 50 times you - just by chance - hit him correctly and it's finally over. That sucks.\n\n\nSo in conclusion: this game consists of walking slowly, dying, walking slowly, dying, having luck and winning and so be able to do some more walking slowly. For all eternity. And withough any reason behind it, without even  a trace of story to back that whole boredom up a bit.\n\nNo, I can't recommend it.","April 24","false","1.2"," 104 of 132 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","104","132","4","10"

My PS2 controller with USB adapter only half-worked, no d-pad or analogue stick functionality even though Fire and Roll buttons worked.  I tried all manner of work-arounds, including JoyToKey and other options.  If you don't have a PS4 or XBOX360 controller, be warned that you may not be able to play the game as intended.  The final boss is next to impossible if you don't have an analogue stick to fire in more than 8 directions.  The rest of the game is extremely difficult.\n\nAnother major warning - NO CONTROL CONFIGURATIONS AT ALL.  You cannot re-bind your inputs.  If you're a AWSD player, the game may be very uncomfortable to play.\n\nA final point on the controls; Holding down a button to run was a completely pointless design choice.  There are no instances where you need to be walking.  This makes rolling and running - the things you want to always be doing - more cumbersome than they need to be, rolling especially when you're in tight situations that require precision.\n\nWORLD & MAP:\n\nPointlessly large.  You'll understand how tiring it is to be holding down a run button by the end of this game.  There are gigantic empty expanses with nothing in them, long passages to other areas with nothing in them, generally just a whole lot of padding in the form of travel time.  There is next to nothing theme-and-setting wise to interest the player.  Some statues and ancient pictures here and there, a very simple fire-arrow puzzle in the ice zone, and a very shallow "Lost Woods" maze (which the game spoils the solution to anyway, if you figure out where the hint is).\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nThe concept here is nice.  The simple, straight-forward arrow gimmick and boss-rush style may have worked really well, if more effort and consideration were put into the rest of the game's design.  The difficulty curve is extremely sharp, shooting up after the first four bosses.   The bosses are unremarkable at best, frustrating meatgrinders at worst.  You'll die to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t opening moves that are too fast to react to if you haven't seen it before.  There are bosses where most of the work comes in just figuring out how to manipulate it's movement to land the critical strike through repeated trial and error.  There are bosses where you just have to hope for the best as you line up your shot admist a frantic or random pattern.\n\nFortunately, the game allows you to progress with just a certain number of bosses down, but the completionist is in for a grueling and unrewarding experience.  I have no idea how this game manages to fit in a "hard mode", or even a "No Rolling" mode - which completely breaks the game, as some attacks REQUIRE you to roll or you'll amost certainly get hit.\n\nARTWORK:\n\nThis game suffers for its unremarkable soundtrack (no title screen music, bad omen), and pixel-art crutch.  A game of this kind - with its gigantic world map, and shallow gameplay - really needed to ace it's Art in order to fill out the experience and make it interesting, instead of a boring and tedious walk from one boss to the next.  The music should have been a motivating force, a soundtrack for an adventure.  Instead it is your generic, relaxed, ambient, "deep" indie work.  The pixel art could have followed a retro standard, or at least have been stylized.  Instead it is a generic, straight and angular, sterile tile-set.\n\nSTORY:\n\nThere is none.  There's one single piece of dialogue in the whole game, and It's an incredibly lazy derivative of "the character may not be doing the right thing".  Even the bosses - the centerpiece of the game - go nameless, with all except two having hieroglyphs instead of a name.\n\n---\n\nIf you're still interested in this game, it is easily pirateable.  You kind of need to do so, to make sure your controller is even going to work before you drop $15 for a game that is arguably worse than free Flash games on the internet.","April 15, 2015","false","8.3"," 404 of 584 people (69%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","69","404","584","6","8"

TL;DR Version at the bottom\n\nTitan souls is essentially a very high quality newgrounds/kongregate game with a wonderful soundtrack, challenging/awesome variety of boss fights, and great visual tone. The problem here is that there really isn't much to really get into. Here are the major points I have for it.\n\nThe game is really quite short only lasting me 2 hours with only a few bosses left to clean up. Your playtime will likely fluctuate based on your skill level and how many attempts each boss takes you. It's similar to something like Super Meat Boy where you will be trying each fight quite a few times. I died 92 times in total.\n\nAs most people know the game's main gimmick is you only have one arrow and that's all you will ever have. Fights are very fast with either you dying in one hit or the boss dying in either a hit to expose them and a hit to a weak point or just one hit to the weak point. While there is plenty of variety in the boss fight paterns the arrow mechanic got dull fast.\n\nThere are more modes you unlock once you beat the game but, again, the arrow mechanic didn't sell me on going through again on a hard mode or a no roll run.\n\nYou can tell that the devs wanted to have the story be told through the enviroment which I normally LOVE to death but in this case it is so very bare bones that there was no initial catch for me and I didn't enjoy the gameplay enough to delvae deeper.\n\nLast of all there's the comparison to Shadow of the Colossus and Dark Souls that I don't think are really acurate. The simlarities to Shadow of the Colossus is the more obvious with the minimalistic story, only boss fights, and the absorbing the boss' "souls" in the end of the fights but the gameplay is totally different where it's more about quick execution and mastery through repitition rather than thinking things through. As for Dark Souls it's nothing like it unless you call anything challenging "like Dark Souls" which would be idiotic.\n\nTL;DR Short game with an interesting mechanic that gets old fast. Won't last more than a couple of hours for most folks and isn't worth the current price of $15 USD IMO. Worth about $5 USD.","April 17, 2015","false","2.2"," 174 of 241 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","174","241","2","0"

This is due to the fact that there is absolutely no depth to the game (as much as I played anyhow).  I understand the controls are supposed to be minimalistic, but the fact that you need to stand still to recall your arrow really just kills any pacing the game has.\n\nPlayed about an hour of it and got extremely bored.  All of the fights end up being the same thing: something (usually the boss or a projectile from the boss) flies at you in a relatively fast speed, you dodge it, then you shoot an extremely small hitbox on the boss.\n\nThe variation on this is when you need to make the boss move somewhere specific when its chasing you.\nMost of your deaths will come from the initial boss activation where you need to shoot it with your bow to get the fight started, but then you need to stand still for about a second and a half before your arrow returns to you.  Most of my deaths in this game have resulted from me just wanting to kill the boss quicker and get the fight over with, because its impossible to die if you just roll whenever you get attacked (because that is the only movement action you have available to you).\n\nControls wise, you need to roll before you can run, meaning you don't ever feel like you are fully in control of what you want to do.  Additionally, the degree of freedom you have while aiming is usually poor compared to the size of the targets you need to shoot.\n\nThe art looks great, and I understand that the game is trying to pull of minimalism in the simplistic control scheme, such as super meat boy does, but the few controls it does have don't feel very smooth.","April 17, 2015","false","0.7"," 164 of 236 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","164","236","0","0"

Half of the bosses feel exactly the same, with only a tiny change in mechanics.  It's waiting for that half-second opening and daring death, as you almost always have to nearly trade your life to score the killing blow.\n\nSome bosses get downright asinine, having "magnetic" attacks (attacks that follow you when you get too close), or even creating deadzones (give me a break; it's sitting there, but if I touch it, INSTANT DEATH!  No, not pushed into it, poke it, INSTANT DEATH!).  It all gets rinse-lather-repeat, and you start to see the same thing in every boss, with a handful of new 'features' over the previous boss of its' type.\n\nBy no means does that make this a poor game; I just believe the developers could have done better.  It felt like, "Well, it's WAY too short unless we add a few more titans..."\n\nWith no expansion of the player, no new methods of gameplay and approach could be added to the bosses, thus it all becomes stale by the time you reach the end.\n\nThe story, itself, while intriguing, is another one of those disingenuously vague ones that reveals and tells almost nothing.  What little bits and pieces are there reveal next-to-nothing of what's going on, or even why you're there.  It's another one of those, "the description of the game tells more about the story than the game itself."  After a certain point, you start to ask yourself, "Why the heck am I even doing this?

I get that the game is supposed to be uber hard, but it's not the kind of uber hard that made me want to come back for more. Like I said, the bosses are really cool.

This game is amazing but it's specifically aimed towards people who like a darn good challenge and don't care about dying a LOT. Not like in Super Meat Boy where it's fast paced but still holds a lot of the trial and error.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nI don't think the constant not recommended reviews said to be the most helpful give this game the right kind of justice. This game is very, very good. I had way too much fun playing it. It's really short however, and would have liked more bosses to fight.\n\nSomething important to mention: THIS GAME HAS A SPECIFIC DEMOGRAPHIC!\n\nWhat do I mean?\n\nIt's simple.\nIf you don't like constantly dying a LOT in a game, traveling back to where you were despite it being a short distance, you will not like this game. You will get infuriated and lose any interest in playing. It wasn't that difficult for me. I died a lot but I kept trudging on because I liked the difficulty of this game. You also only have one type of attack and that's a single arrow. You fire it and then you can pull it back or run up and grab it. But it's all you'll have.\n\nI liked the "One hit equals death" aspect of the game as it wasn't exclusive to you, the bosses die in one hit too. The one type of attack meshes with this very well. However unlike you, bosses can only be killed at a certain moment in a specifc area. I actually watched a friend play this a little and knew how to get through the first three bosses and knew to hit the tail of the electric eel, but the rest I was pretty much on my own. While some weaknesses are obvious, others take a little more thought. (Seriously, if I was not told about the tail weakness, I don't think I would have ever figured it out).\n\nThis game has some wonderful music as well. It's truly astounding. It makes every part of the game that much more lively. It's a shame the game is so short. When you beat it, you unlock new modes like Hard mode, Iron Mode (Die once and it's game over), and No Roll or Run mode (How the hell is this one possible? Please tell me!). There may be even more than that when you beat those modes, I'm unsure as of yet. I only just unlocked these modes after all.\n\nEither way, the game was very fun. I beat it in the same run I started in as it was very enjoyable depsite constantly dying. The more you figure out trying to fight bosses repeatedly helps you figure out ways to make fighting them that much more easy though still remaining quite difficult. If you're a casual gamer, just stay away from this because you'll get infuriated. For all those hardcore gamers, get this. It's just a blast.\n\nEDIT: I've just gone through a lot of hard mode and have also realized I missed about 6 titans as you don't have to kill them all to reach The Soul. Once killing all of the titans, I got to experience Truth. While I haven't made it in hard mode yet as I didn't know about these titans that existed, I've beaten truth in the normal game and that was a lot of fun. He's a great boss to finish things off with. Defeating all the titans in the game doesn't really increase the game's length by much but it sure does make the game feel more complete. That's all you really need anyway.","June 19, 2015","true","13.6"," 75 of 111 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","75","111","4","5"

It is also very obviously "inspired" by Shadow of the Colossus, Dark Souls and to a degree Zelda. Not exactly the worst games to mash up.\n\nUnfortunately, the actual gameplay is infuriating and not even close to being as great as the aforementioned titles. I want(ed) to like this game. After finally finishing it, I pretty much hate every single pixel of it and will NEVER touch it again unless I want to die of cardiac arrest or develop malignant tumors.\n\nHere is why:\nThe "challenge" of this game is based on extremly contrived limitations. You fight all enemies with a single arrow. I am okay with that. What I am not okay with is shooting that single arrow while slooowly charging it up and using analog controls to hopefully hit wonky hurtboxes and having to sloooowly "force-pull" it back into my quiver if I ♥♥♥♥ed up. I am also not able to move while I am doing that. Ugh. It isn't so bad during the first bosses you encounter - but in the end you basically have to be a pychic and anticipate where to shoot before it happens.\n\nIf this sounds like ♥♥♥♥, wait til I tell you about the dodge roll. Obviously, nobody of the devs ever heard of invincibility frames. You know, those little frame that made the Souls-game a success? NOT. IN. THIS. BLOODY. GAME. I imagined dodge-rolling through projectiles is a given considering what the game is trying to do… on the contrary, the roll more often than not killed me instead. It didn't help that many times you can't really tell what can hit you / where it actually is - can you roll under something because it is above you or not? Well, in 9/10 cases you cannot - no matter if it looks like you can.\n\nThe game has ZERO margin for error (and sometimes it's more like a -3 to -7 margin) and it punishes you with having to backtrack to most boss rooms hundreds of times. Kinda slowly. And you cannot even roll up the stairs. Out of the 5 hours I played, I guess 3.5 hours were spend just moving from the savepoints into boss rooms. I have never raged more in my life. I had to stop in between for the sake of not smashing my stuff.\n\nThe worst thing is, that it isn't rewarding in the slightest. There is no real learning curve here - even if you know what to do, there are a million random factors that will stop you from achieving victory. The final boss takes the cake and is basically a glorified "flipping the coin"-situation. If you are psychic, this is the game for you - if you are a normal human being, don't waste money on this.\n\nIt's a shame about the visuals and the music, excellent as they are - but this game is absolutely devoid of any fun, genuine excitment or anything making the hardships worthwhile. Nothing oldschool or good about this terrible design - I have nothing but contempt left for Titan Souls and I do not wish for anybody to suffer through this awful piece of code.

There's not much to the game in terms of its mechanics and controls. Your character has the ability to run and roll, that's it. Weapon wise, you have a bow with one arrow that once you have shot it will return to you by holding down a button, like Yondu from guardians of the galaxy, Yes I whistled every time.\n\nThat's it all you can do no less no more. The interesting elements in the game come from the battles with the Titans. Each titan is different in design and mechanics. Titans will have one weak point which is your arrows ultimate goal. Hitting the weak spot with the arrow will kill the titan dead. Some battles will require you do wear down a defense using environmental factors such as using fire to melt ice or using a titans own attack to knock out his teeth. Titan souls boss battles are all about learning your enemies attacks, movements and timing, then striking when the time is right.\n\nThe boss mechanics are both fun and frustrating. Learning how the boss works is one thing but having to time your single attack just right while avoiding getting flattened is quite another. This is a one hit kill game and if you get hit your done. All is not lost you'll respawn at the nearest checkpoint and have the long walk of shame back to the titan to try again. Shooting your arrow is also a test in timing as you have to power up the shot which takes maybe half a second but it can only take that long to get stomped.\n\nLet's have no illusions, you'll be dying a hell of a lot in this game which I don't mind terribly, nor do I mind the difficulty of the Titans, I like a good challenge. I do however mind the amount of time I have to spend walking back from checkpoints as it can take an age. There's no enemies, or for that matter anything to do bar a few puzzles and boss fights so why I have to spend so much time walking is beyond me. It's unbelievably frustrating, the sheer amount of time you have to back track through various zones to get back to a titan. It wouldn't be so bad if there was things to see or do on the various routes to the boss locations but the pixel environments are not particularly interesting nor is there anything to collect or see. The traveling ultimately becomes a test in patience which is something that for me personally ran out very quickly.\n\nThe games chosen art style is not bad by any stretch. The pixel style works well and the titans look really good. The soundtrack too ironically provides nice soothing tones as you feel the slow burning rage of frustration. The pixel art style while it is not bad and works well, doesn't do anything for me. It's an easy solution for indie developers which is why it is used in so many games. I think that it's beginning to lose its appeal on the eye for me personally and I feel the game would have looked stunning with a hand-drawn styling but again that's a personal preference.\n\nIt should be made clear that mechanically the game is sound. It works as intended, its a stable game with very few bugs and for people who live for boss fights, it's a treat. However for me it lacks depth in its game-play. I understand the idea behind the one arrow mechanic, indeed the very concept of the game is 'you only have one' and that its supposed to be about using what you have to overcome the enemy. The game admittedly does this well, it makes you think, use your brain to overcome the titans, learn their strategies and test your evasion skill to survive.\n\nWhat the game doesn't have is progression depth, nor indeed does it have a story or even a motivation which for me ruins the experience. I would have liked some pay off from defeated titans which you don't get in Titan Souls, yes you unlock more titans but the experience of running around and fighting bosses was not enough for me. The lack of any character progression makes the victory of taking down a boss......lesser for me. I like progression, item progression, character progression, skill progression, something to keep me engaged. Something to keep me motivated past the frustration. Tough games like Dark souls have items, weapons, Armour, leveling and story. All those things keep you going when your getting pummeled by a boss time after time after time.\n\nTitan souls has none of this, which while it does provide a nice simplistic streamlined experience, also means that its a game with all the annoyances of similar games but without any of the good sides. It becomes a punishment simulator, a wet dream for self flagellation. Run here, die in four seconds, run back, die, run back, it grows tiresome very fast. This being said of course, I can also see fans of games like dark souls taking a shine to this and enjoying it a lot. There's merit in the Titan's design and the battles are very well constructed. The biggest design flaw if not the only one in my opinion is the checkpoint system, it adds far to much frustration on top of the battles to the point of becoming uninteresting. For a game that's sole purpose is for me to fight big huge titans, I seem to be spending a lot of time running and looking at nothing. I want to be right back in the action as soon as possible not running though maps that have nothing there.\n\nUltimately it's a well built game that should please fans of games like shadow of the colossus and dark souls. While it certainly didn't have enough content and depth for me, looking from someone else's perspective, I could see why they could get a lot of enjoyment from it. Since the game is well built and mechanically sound that's what it comes down too, your personal preference, what your looking for in a game, what things you like and what things you don't. For me its a no but even while I do no like and did not enjoy playing it, I can still sit and admire the well built mechanics, great looking Titans and overall intention the developers set out for the game.","April 21, 2015","false","3.7"," 93 of 151 people (62%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","62","93","151","4","1"

However, I can't fully recomend it because of one complaint that will probably sound shallow. Every time you die to a boss, you have to walk all the way back. A boss can kill you in 3 seconds, and then the walk back takes 10-30 seconds. Imagine if in super meatboy you were kicked back to the main menu every time you died.

My first run took less than 2.5h, and that was an all-boss run (I assumed all bosses were required, but apparently you only need to do some of the 18 fights). A simple run doing only the required number of bosses you could probably finish a first run in an 1.5 or less, if you are decent at these types of games.\n\nKinda neat idea. Pretty easy though, most of the boss' weak spots are blatantly obvious, and the only real 'challenge' is either learning exact timings or simply getting lucky with your shots.\n\nNot much of replayability. The extra modes are simple additions like 'no deaths' and 'no rolling', rather than making the bosses more difficult, changing up their attack patterns, etc.\n\nI'd pick it up if it drops below $5 or you get it bundled with other stuff, but not for $15, or even $10.

It’s beautiful.  It’s in itself a work of Art. Gorgeous, challenging, rewarding and unforgiving. It’s overall a fairly short game but I caught myself more than once just slowly walking around enjoying the scenery or swimming around whenever I got the chance just so my sore Body doesn’t hurt as much after dying numerous times, over and over and over and … over again…\n\nI loved every second of it. Every death was my own fault and that’s the beauty of the game. It’s all about how you act and where you choose to or at what time you’re gonna shoot your arrow.\n\nAlso this game feels like a pixelated version of Shadow of the Colossus. Exploring alone is so much fun it's hard to describe but enough of that.\n\nNow let’s get to it folks!\n\nStoryIt might not look like it but yes this game does have indeed a story.\nTaken from the games website:\n\nBetween Earth and the world beyond lie the Titan Souls, the spiritual source and sum of all living things. Now scattered amongst the ruins and guarded by the idle titans charged with their care, a solitary hero armed with but a single arrow is once again assembling shards of the Titan Soul in a quest for truth and power.\nSo now you know. You and your trusty Arrow are on a Quest for Truth and Power. No fame. No treasure. You seek power and truth. An honest quest. I certainly like it.\n\nWill you be able to use your trusty arrow and defeat the titan to gain the Titan Souls?\nOnly one way to find out …\n\nGameplayI usually don’t do stuff like this but let me quote Eminem real quick:\n\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo\nIt certainly fits the gameplay ... yo.\nAll you have is one arrow. Once you shot it you have to retrieve it before you can try to hit your target again. But your best friend is movement. You have to move around, dodge and roll in the right moments to avoid getting crushed or blown to pieces. You have to find the perfect angle for your shot and you only have a tiny window in which you can actually defeat the titans.\nI do have some good and bad news though.\nThe bad news: You die in one hit\nThe good news: Titans as well\nSo you see it’s an even matchup. Whether or not you’re the one who will survive or not depends solely on your skill and a tad of luck. Just a tad though.\n\nVisualHonest opinion?\nI’m blown away. I haven’t seen any screens prior to buying the game and boy I’m seriously blown away. I caught myself just wandering around and enjoying the scenery.\nYou’ll walk through and enjoy different biomes. There’s a snowy one which is my personal favorite by far. I’ve taken so many screens and just … alright I admit it … I just found myself rolling through the snow going Weeeeeee!. Feel free to judge me but I enjoyed it. Very much to be honest.\nThere’s just so much open space in the game and I really had the urge just to roll around and explore everything. I was swimming around numerous times since my body was so sore after being beaten to death for like the 57th time.\nIn one of the other Biomes, in the Wood one to be specific, there’s a place which instantly reminded me of the Lost Woods in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. What really made me smile when I found out that I’m also greeted by a maze-like area.\nOverall the Pixel Art is stunning. I really love the look of the game and it’s just gorgeous.\nThere are so many small details placed all over the game .. Perfect.\n\nSoundEvery track on the OST is beautiful but one caught me a bit off guard I’d say.\nThe track Souls reaches something deep inside me … It’s beautiful. Gorgeous. Peaceful. At the same time it does sound like something is about to happen. It’s not a carefree track … It’s more like the Calm before the Storm. It’s … I can’t put it really into words to be quite honest but I really, really like this track. Actually go ahead and listen to it now!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5XoWY_D3fE&list=PLTBIh-EgHxf3hncWumlOwR04LH5PQ0M73\nOverall I’m really happy with the whole OST and I can only recommend it.\n\nWhat else can I say?Do you love challenging games? Do you love Pixel Art?\nAre you a Masochist?\nIf you said yes to all three of those you’ll really enjoy Titan Souls.\nThe masochist part is important. You will die. A lot. It’s part of the game. Enjoy every death. Embrace it. At the same time the game’s really rewarding. Your reward is not only one more dead titan on your agenda but discovering new biomes and the associated soundtrack and just … enjoying every second of the game.\nLet me quote the Developer for the end:\n\nDash and run from the titan’s attacks but do not fear death, as it is both inevitable and plentiful in Titan Souls.\nThat being said enjoy it. The game is really fun, challenging but rewarding at the same time.\n\nNote: If you die over and over again to the same titan feel free to cry. It's actually adviced to cry whenever you feel like the game's mean to you. Come back to it later and just try again. And again. And again 'till you succed ... or cry again.","June 21, 2015","true","2.8"," 85 of 142 people (60%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","60","85","142","10","0"

Titan Souls is as close to a 2D pixel-version Shadow Of The Colossus game as we will ever get  (minus the horse and the pointless cut-scenes found within SotC, of course!) It's an open world game which you control one small character and enter different rooms, each room contains a boss where you must then discover it's weak point and ultimately defeat it. You die in one hit so you should expect to die and backtrack alot - if you die, you don't respawn in the boss room you were in, instead you have to walk all the way back.\n\n"We don't care about the story in this kind of game!"-Said no one ever The game's storyline? Titan Souls' story isn't all that apparent in the game but once you start to put the obscure pieces together you get something very bland and forgettable. Titan Souls apparently takes place in a world in between ours and the world beyond, yet some of the titans are located in heaven and in hell. Doesn't make much sense now does it? All in all, the more you learn about the story, the more you find it to be a messy contraption of mythology that's ultimately very poorly written and just plain forgettable.\n\nThe controls? Simple. You move with the analog stick. There are only three action buttons. Roll, run and Shoot. You have only one weapon - a bow and with that bow, you only have one arrow which you can re-use. It's an idea which doesn't push to any extreme, yet it works. Less is more.\n\nThe graphics? Retro-esque pixel-art style at an isometric angle with a modern color palette. Giving you a clear overhead view of the action. For the indie gamer, it certainly offers nothing new and what we get in Titan Souls is to somewhat be expected but some gamers will find this style cute and full if charm. Less is more.\n\nThe sound? Average, I'm afraid. There isn't much to be said about the sound effects or the soundtrack. It's not by any means the best nor the worst thing about the game but honestly, I expected more from the game's sound department, quite frankly, I think we all did. The soundtrack and overall sound of the game fell behind compared to other games I've played but it does get the job done and it's nice that it's included in the Collector's Edition... It's not Super Meat Boy\n\nHey, what do you mean all bosses? Doesn't that get annoying and repetetive after awhile? Well, that's pretty much up to each individual player I suppose. Do you like boss rush modes? The game is basically one big boss rush, however, I did find that in Titan Souls, each boss was different and unique from one another - which is more that I can say about Shadow Of The Colossus. Every Titan design is interesting and the animations are just beautiful.\n\nOverall, the game itself may not really offer anything new in terms of mechanics but conceptually, it's a whole other beast. Can we name any other 2D Pixel-Art Shadow Of The Colosus type game? No, no we cannot. And it's easy to see why that is the game's claim to fame. Despite the simplicity of the game, it just works and most things gel together really well for Titan Souls.\n\nWhy did you compare Titan Souls to Shadow Of The Colossus, Titan Souls has nothing to do with Shadow Of The Colossus!!!!! WRONG, Titan Souls was so inspired by Shadow Of The Colossus that it's almost unbearable, anyone who has played both games can and will easily see this. Look at the developer diaries my friend, developer diaries....Hence an achievement you can unlock named "Shadow Of The Colossus"\n\nThis game is not a bad game, conceptually it is great, it's just the lack of depth and the bland story that keep me from recommending this game at the asking price. I hate that I could not bring myself to love it as much as I wanted to. Hoping for a sequel with more emphasis on a real story.","March 26","false","1.5"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","21","28","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/297130/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Here’s a proposal: the satisfaction of Titan Souls is not in your success, but in proving that you are capable of it.\n\nThis is a bit abstract but stick with me a moment and I’ll explain. Titan Souls is a game of extreme efficiency. You are given one arrow and one hit to defeat an assembly of enormous and monstrously powerful titans. There are no upgrades, no minor enemies or side objectives, just you against an array of incredible and individual foes. The hook is in how Titan Souls resolves the asymmetry of its bosses by designing them to go down just as quickly as you, that being with a single well aimed shot to their Achilles’ Heal. Your job then is to figure out where this weak point is and how to hit it, a task that sounds simple on paper but becomes exponentially more challenging when you’re staring down a 50-foot hallucinogen excreting mushroom or an anthropomorphic blob of sentient lava.\n\nParallels have been drawn between Titan Souls’ and Shadow of the Colossus, both featuring a stripped down design focused entirely on encounters with huge monument like creatures. But where Titan Souls divulges from Shadow of the Colossus is in its framing and structure. Where Shadow of the Colossus’ fights would often be drawn out and almost poetic in their grandiosity, Titan Souls’ are fast and brutal. Titan Souls doesn’t want to entrance you with its majesty, it wants to break you with it. Because of the nature of its 1-1 design, Titan Souls’ bosses have been designed in such a way as to kill you quickly and repeatedly as you slowly learn enemy patterns and suss out how to exploit them. Once you do manage to land a successful blow though there is rarely a moment of true catharsis. Everything moves so fast and is over so suddenly that the ramp up to victory often seems far greater than the reward, each kill leading only to another fight.\n\nBut say we take a metaphorical step back and consider if Titan Souls’ actually wants you to feel satisfied. Nothing in its design is built to appease the player’s need for recognition. There is a brief animation at the end of each kill letting you know you did the thing, but otherwise Titan Souls’ feels in most ways utterly indifferent to your achievement. What it cares much more about is in keeping you from it as long as it can in as patronizing and taunting a way possible.\n\nTitan Souls, I would argue, doesn’t want you to feel satisfied, it wants you to feel accomplished. Success isn’t dictated by the kill itself but in getting to throw it back in the game’s face as you declare it too little a challenge. The relationship Titan Souls build throughout the game between itself and you, the player, is one of domination and strength through brutality. It wants to make you work for your kill, dropping you back at inconvenient checkpoints after each death, only to sludge back across the overworld and die in less time than it took to get to the boss itself. It’s agonizing and tedious and you can almost feel Titan Souls laughing at you as you continue to throw yourself at these slumbering behemoths over and over. And for what? With no satisfaction to be found in the kill you are left with little more than a sensation of all the air being sucked out of the room, your only purpose for existing now dead at your feet and you no less content. As a final gift upon completing the game you are awarded with “hard mode,” captioned “the real challenge” as if to further demean the player’s success by effectively christening it a warm up.\n\nIf all this sounds entirely the opposite of fun that’s because in many ways it is, and I think that’s intentional. Titan Souls isn’t interested in fulfilling a player’s power fantasy, it just wants to see how far they’ll run, going about itself with a smugness that is simultaneously alienating and gravitational. It’s a game that exists purely for itself, and it feeds into that elitism in a way that eats at you until you find yourself once again playing along purely for the sake of proving to the game that you are better at it than is at killing you.\n\nAnd once you get into Titan Souls’ rhythm, removed from the necessity of payoff or justification beyond proving yourself capable enough to play along, the game’s flow can become hypnotic. Titan Souls is cruel, but it is also incredibly smooth and refined. Your moveset is limited but every action has a purposeful weight to it. Rolling feels slick and chunky, blending seamlessly with your run to create a tactile sense of momentum. Aiming a shot momentarily slows down time as the camera narrows on your character rooted to the spot, causing each second spent pulling back your bow to feel terrifying and vulnerable but also necessarily precise. Titan Souls’ core gameplay loop is brilliant in its compactness and feel, its narrow design granting each inclusion an enormity unto itself, each mechanic feeling invaluable and utterly necessary. Titan Souls remains a small game in most respects, but it is so concise that it rarely feels that way in the context of itself.\n\nTitan Souls is also a wonder to behold, enthralling environments stretching all around you as you search for your next fight, the world’s indecipherable history jumping out at you from wall carvings and monuments to events unknown as you wander through forests and dungeons that have long fell into disuse. It’s an intensely isolating experience but not one that feels lonely so much as decidedly melancholy, accompanied by a somber and gorgeous soundtrack that takes the place of exposition to set the mood. If it wasn’t so fixated on death, Titan Souls’ world would almost be soothing, but the presence of such enormous enemies instead imbues it with a sinister tone fitting for the brutality of your quest. It’s unquestionably grim, but with how fast everything moves you probably won’t have time to stop and think about it.\n\nTitan Souls is a challenging game, both in terms of play and enjoyment. Its antagonistic nature likely requires a particularly masochistic and determined mindset to appreciate, as on the surface Titan Souls is a game that goes to almost absurd lengths to push players away. But underneath all that snobbery is a fantastically sharp design philosophy that becomes a means to its own end, a delight to employ even as the game itself refuses to allow you any satisfaction for your accomplishments. Instead it asks you to do it again, faster, smarter, and with more efficiency. How you respond to this demand will likely determine if you’re the sort of player capable of finding the “fun side” of Titan Souls, or if you’ll bounce off it and go in search of something less abrasive, a decision I couldn’t entirely fault you for.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","March 25","true","4.0"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","7"

If you're going to make your game just boss fights, you need to make the boss fights and mechanics fun and not worry so much about exploring your boring overworld.  It feels like genre fiction where the author spits out the lore, gross national product and other incessant details of their world with no regard to making the reader care about the setting or characters in the first place.\n\nControls just feel clunky, like your character movement is too slow for the size of the world and the single arrow mechanic is a chore.  Despite that, I would of kept playing a bit more if not for the stupid trek back to the bosses.  This is a one-hit kill game, so you run into occasions where you die seconds into a fight and then need to spend 20-30 seconds running back to the fight.  This isn't enjoyable in any manner.  It's not a Dark Souls or the like, where the run from the checkpoint to the boss is full of other potentially interesting things; instead, you just slowly move through the boring and barren overworld until you get back to the boss.\n\nI don't know whether this design choice is due to wanting to artificially inflate the game time or because the devs thought this was a beautiful and mysterious world worth exploring, but either way, it doesn't result in a fun experience.\n\nOne of the more disappointing games I've played in a while.","February 6","false","0.8"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","22","31","0","0"

When the demo came out, I downloaded it immediately. And I had fun! It was really great, learning how to defeat each of the bosses in a unique way. I preordered the full game (something I almost never do, especially not on Steam—even if refunds are allowed now) and eagerly awaited the day I could play it.\n\nEventually the day came, and I installed the full game. After defeating the few bosses I had already seen, I was set free into the world of Titan Souls. And what a world it was! The atmosphere was lovely; the music was peaceful, and the environments were beautiful. I enjoyed walking around to find each new area, even if there were some long walks between the action. It felt like a smaller, pixelated version of Journey during these moments.\n\nHere's the gameplay in a nutshell: you are a lone wanderer, and for whatever reason, you are hunting and defeating these massive beasts known as the Titans in an attempt to acquire the Titan Souls. You have a bow and a single arrow that can be called back to you by holding down a single button. Each Titan only requires one or two hits to defeat, and since you have no armor, it only takes one hit to kill you. The game is about finding the perfect shot and the right timing, and for a while, it works. The controls are simple, but if you're going to put yourself through this, I recommend a gamepad. I can't imagine playing this on a keyboard.\n\nAt first, it was fun. Testing the waters and tryin to discover each Titan's weakness was entertaining in itself, and if I managed to get one on the first or second try I felt great. But I stopped feeling good after the first few deaths. I felt like I was failing the game, like I wasn't good enough to play it. But I kept going, and I kept dying, and I kept trying not to break my controller in half. And it only got worse after I died ten times fighting the same enemy (ooking at you, Yeti). Most of the bosses are insanely difficult to defeat, forcing you to try multiple times to get that one perfect shot. Here's a hint: it won't happen. You won't get that shot, because the weak spot on each boss is so miniscule and requires such perfect aim that the chances of you hitting it are pretty damn close to zero.\n\nEven if by some miracle I managed to defeat a Titan, I didn't feel any accomplishment. I just felt glad that it was over. I felt like I had just finished cleaning my entire house, and any relief I should have felt was replaced by the anger that I just spent so long cleaning something that's only going to get dirty again. If I'm going to put a lot of energy into a game, I'd like to feel a bit victorious after passing each milestone. Titan Souls instilled no such feeling. It only instilled feelings of extreme anger and sadness—failing each boss, and after finally defeating it, remembering that there are plenty more to fight...If you're going to play this game and get your money's worth, you're going to have to beat them all. It won't happen. Believe me. If you want to punish yourself, clean your entire house. At least that will produce a sense of accomplishment, if only temporarily.","June 17, 2015","false","2.9"," 156 of 276 people (57%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","57","156","276","14","5"

From what I can tell, there's no progression - you're as powerful as you'll ever get right from the beginning. That's not a bad thing. I've not played a game of this genre before, but from the first area I found I was really enjoying it. I think I can quite safely say that this is a genre that I would enjoy.\n\nHowever, there is one major issue. "Controller Recommended" is not quite precise. This game is possible to play without a controller, but ultimately an exercise in frustration. The reason for this is quite simple: A lot of the bosses after the first four were designed for an analog aiming mechanism. Which would be fine, except for the fact that the developer, for some reason, decided not to implement a keyboard and mouse control system. This means that playing the game as expected on PC is inferior to on a console.\nAdditionally, there is no remapping of controls.\n\nNow, if they had said "Controller required" and cut out the keyboard controls altogether, fair enough. I wouldn't have bought it, because I don't like using controllers, but everyone that did would have gone into it knowing that they'd be playing on a controller. However, they really didn't bother to implement proper keyboard and mouse controls. This is a bad port, not a game that was designed for PC. As such, it should never have been released on PC.\n\nI may continue this with a controller, but I doubt it. And if I do, it's purely because everything else about this game is amazing, and rock solid. It just should not be a PC game in it's current state.","July 3, 2015","false","1.5"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","20","29","0","0"

The protagonist wields a single magic arrow that must be used to slay enormous creatures called Titans. In an unexpected turn, both the player and the boss have but a single hit point--so any hit is lethal.\n\nFair Warning: This game is much, much harder without a gamepad.\n\nGameplayThere are no enemies in the game other than bosses. In order to fight a boss, the player must venture through the overworld and find the boss stage. Within it, the player is almost guaranteed to die a dozen times before fully understanding the mechanics of each fight. Each boss fights in a different way (although some overall mechanics may be reused), and it is up to the player to figure out how to counteract it.\n\nIt sounds easy, but the fact that the protagonist dies in one hit is really crippling and makes the game that much more punishing. If you aren't prepared to fight, all the bosses are fully capable of killing you seconds after you engage. Between dodges, there is not much time to calculate and execute an attack, and little room for error.\n\nMinimalismTitan Souls takes a very minimalist approach. Aside from the two buttons and the directional keys, there are no other controls. Throughout the game, there is no instruction whatsoever. You will not find any explanations, hints, or even a world map. As a major pitfall, there are no items or unlocks, making this game lack any feel of progression. You find a boss, die a few times, then kill it. Repeat. This (lack of) feature preserves the difficulty throughout the game, but forces the game to deliver complexity through each individual boss fight.\n\nThis game isn't an RPG, but looks and feels like it should be one. Most negative reviews criticize this game for lacking RPG elements, when it clearly isn't intended to be one in the first place.\n\nWorldThe world itself in Titan Souls is very beautifully rendered in pixel graphics. It depicts a tranquil ruin, with a very mystic (and cryptic) feel. However, it soon becomes clear that something more sinister is at hand as you hunt Titans, juxtaposing the chaotic boss rooms and the peaceful outdoors. The soundtrack plays into this dichotomy well and is a very welcome feature of the game. Everything about Titan Souls feels ancient and colossal, creating a wonderful atmosphere.\n\nIf you are looking for story-driven content, however, you won't find it in this game. There is no formal story; the game does not elaborate on anything and leaves everything up to assumption. But it is a really, really cool world.\n\nVerdictTitan Souls is one of my favorite games, but I will be honest about it. This is a very difficult game that likes to capitalize on the player's stress. Expect only a series of short boss fights with a little extra space between boss rooms. Overall, I think Titan Souls is really fun, but it isn't right for everyone. Get it if you crave difficulty and fast-paced 2D games.","December 30, 2015","true","17.1"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","17","24","0","0"

As someone who has used both a controller and keyboard/mouse, i think its fair to say that unless your game requres degrees of acceleration in movement (like in a driving game), there's no dowside to Key/Mouse. Instead of including mouse aiming, Acidnerve decided "Eh, ♥♥♥♥ keyboard/mouse." That's not to say that Key/Mouse dont work. In fact, the game is completly completable with only 8-directional aiming, but then it becomes about positioning your character to take advantage of only being able to shoot in 8 direcetion.\n\nThe graphics and music are both pretty, but nothing you haven't seen before. No real attempt is made to make either truely stand out.\n\nThe boss fights are a very tense one-hit-kill scenario for both the player and the boss, but without any actual filler in between bossfights, there's no sense of tension, no feeling like you've overcome hoards of foes or mountains of chalenges to culimate in a climaxtic moment.\n\nOh and the story is non-existant. There seems to be a hint of what COULD have been a story, within the scenery, and a few of the bosses, but something got scrapped along the way.\n\nIn short, its not actually BAD. just dissapointing. If this game drops to about $5 I'd reccomend it as a short and sweet experiece. Until then, I have to give it a no.\n","August 20, 2015","false","2.3"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","20","30","0","0"

I love how free exchange of ideas is becoming commonplace allowing flash animators with great ideas to become success stories (read binding of isaac, risk of rain, etc.), and Titan Souls is no different.  This studio brought an amazing idea to bear.  Cut out the cheap trash enemies and give us a tale befitting a titan in small shoes.\n\nI was instantly charmed by the game.  A young hero with just a bow and arrow imbibed with power.  This hero is small in a large and amazing world spanning the seasons (as is tradition) against bosses that are simultaneously terrifying and unique.  You have 3 buttons to use: joystick, shoot (and retrieve), and roll (and run).  Between the three, you have to solve the boss puzzles and learn their patterns, their tells, and their weaknesses.  I cream over games like these.\n\n...but sadly, TS was over before it started.  My first playthrough I beat in under 2 hours.  And while I will certainly go back for some achievements, particularly to beat it in hard mode and potentially the other modes, I can't rightfully appreciate that a game's main campaign is 2 hours long.  (I do feel like I missed a boss or something, but at 2 hours to be 90%+ finished? For those not seeking a facebashingly difficulty game, you might want to turn around now).  I have 0 reason to go back outside of steam achievements, and what started as a beautiful game that only expanded and promised me something amazing, left me with a short game with less than 30 enemies total.  And for a $15 price tag, I am hard-pressed to recommend this to anyone that didn't receive it as a gift (for me, I was gifted it from a charity event).\n\nIt was fun.

Those people do a great job of detailing the positive things about the game before they start complaining. You're reading this negative review though because you want to know why NOT to buy the game, so I'll just cut straight to it: with a game that is designed to be as hard as this one is, allowing the player to quickly retry the bit that they're going to be re-doing over and over is really important to keeping the player engaged.\n\nMaking me run all the way back to the boss again from the checkpoint feels completely pointless. It's a waste of my time. Nothing is going to kill me on my way back, because the levels are completely empty between the bosses. Seriously... the only enemy I have to contend with on my repeated walk of shame... is boredom.\n\nImagine a racing game where you knew that if you didn't NAIL the first corner, you were going to have to re-start to have any chance at winning the race. If that game made you sit through 45 seconds of loading screens before you could re-start the race, you'd want to throw your controller through the screen pretty soon. Same thing here. I can easily imagine that if I were to keep track of all the time I spent playing this game, over half of it would be spent re-tracing my steps between the checkpoint location and the fight where I was going to die over and over until I nailed the timing sufficiently to beat that boss.","August 16, 2015","false","1.6"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","20","31","0","0"

For the record I really really like Dark Souls, and I like this game for the same reason I like Dark Souls -- simple mechanics, imaginative bosses, and great atmosphere.\n\nThe controls are almost really tight, the bosses are almost really well designed, and the artstyle almost complements the world excellently. This game is almost really really amazing.\n\nI won't review the story because it's not a game you should play for the story, and anyone who thinks the story is bad or shallow doesn't realize it's not an RPG. It just has a fantasy artstyle.\n\nControls\nThe controls are simple, but leave a little more to be desired. The rolling and running share one button which makes the dodging slightly clunky. Often one finds themself in a situation where they want to run one way but because the were facing a slightly different direction they rolled in a non-desired direction and thus killed themself -- this is my biggest qualm with this game.\n\nBosses\nThe bosses are super original and have interesting attack patterns. But the intense player-tracking makes the bosses feel unfair sometimes. It often feels like one is not outsmarting the boss, but rather the game itself. Although it still feels amazing to finally kill a troublesome boss with one well placed arrow. The "Gotcha!" feeling is superb and makes killing bosses very satisfying, especially on hard-mode.\n\nArtsyle/Atmosphere\nThe artsyle makes key areas, such as areas containing bosses, feel massive, but makes the spaces in between feel empty and void of detail. Travelling from place to place can seem like a chore but if the world were bigger, which is something a lot of people suggest, the travelling would be loathsome; so in terms of gameplay the world benefits from not being massive.\n\nIf the game were slightly bigger, it could use more bosses, more structures, and more little puzzles and secrets to compliment it better, which I think would do this game a huge favour.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis game is almost really really awesome, and it's painful how not stellar it is.\n\nIt has everything required to be a widely loved and played game, it just needs some tweaking. Unless the devs believe this product, as is, is exactly as they envisioned it. In which case it's an all right game. Perhaps this game could have an awesome, balanced, better sequel that could be all of this.\n\nBUT I REALLY REALLY WANT TO LOVE THIS GAME MORE.","June 21, 2015","true","6.8"," 23 of 37 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","23","37","0","0"

I'm pretty terrible, actually... And yet, I can still enjoy them  ( if playing Nuclear Throne for 120 hours doesn't prove it, I don't know what does). It's because those games, apart from being hard as nails, are also rewarding and even if you fail, they still encourage you to try again. You failed? Here, try it again. And again. One more time...You finally pull it off and it feels great.\n\nTitan Souls isn't like that. It doesn't feel great. Yes, it is hard, but it's also tedious, frustrating and overall, not really interesting if I'm being honest.\n\nYou're a solitary character roaming the world, going from one boss to another. You have a bow, an arrow (yes, one arrow) that you have to retrieve each time you shoot. The combat is very simple, mechanically, but I don't mind that.\n\nYou go in the room, the fight starts and you die pretty much instantly. Believe me, we are talking a few seconds here. Obviously, it takes time until you figure their weak spot or their "pattern".\nThe problem is, every time you die, you have to walk back to that room. Every. Time. What this means is, you'll probably spend 90% of the time walking from spawns to boss rooms. Not even kidding. And you know…when you make a game, where you can only do two things ( a) walking b) fighting bosses), that's a big ♥♥♥♥ing problem. It's actually kinda funny, that the battles are not as frustrating as getting to them. You loose interest not because the game is hard, but because the game forces you TO WALK. It's just...absurd.\n\nNow…Many people have compared this to Shadow of the Colossus. I'll just say this - I don't think SoC is all that interesting, either. It's kind of dull, mechanically, BUT it makes you feel something. Titan Souls doesn't. I honestly don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about Titans. These fights don't even feel like boss fights.,I didn't find them rewarding in any way, and most of the time, it just felt like I got lucky.\n\nOne thing I love about this game is the art style.

I'm an old school gamer, so the challenge was nice for me...to a point. I read the reviews about how hard the game is (and it is hard), but they didn't bother me because I enjoy when a game challenges me...if it's a fair challenge. The problem? Tital Souls isn't exactly a fair challenge.\n\nPROS:\n\n- The graphics and music are beautiful\n- The gameplay is unique and fun (for a while)\n- Exploration and a couple puzzles are highlights\n- Some of the titan battles are challenging and fun\n\nI enjoyed the first half or so of Titan Souls. It could have been a much better game, had it been more like a "Zelda" type action RPG, but that's not what the devs were going for...unfortunately. As others have said, the game is basically a boss-rush game where you go from one room to another challenging giant titans. Some of the bosses were challenging and fun, and gave me a real sense of accomplishment when I beat them. However, the best parts of the game were exploring the somewhat vast world looking for the titans (and other secrets). There are even a couple instances of light puzzle solving, which I wish had been expanded upon. More exploration, more puzzles, and fewer titan encounters would have made a much better experience. The game only took a couple hours to finish, and when I was finally done, I was glad it was over.\n\nCONS:\n\n- An unfair challenge at times\n- It feels like you need to be lucky to beat some of the bosses\n- Giving a taste of exploration and puzzle solving makes you realize what this game COULD have been\n\nAs I said earlier, the first half or so of the game is enjoyable. However, in the later parts of Titan Souls, it becomes a lesson in frustration as you repeatedly retry the titans over and over again. You typically know what you need to do to defeat the giant boss, it's just a matter of being pixel perfect in your execution. Even more frustrating is the fact that I defeated a couple of the later titans on pure, dumb luck. When I FINALLY defeated these titans that took me 30 tries, I felt no sense of accomplishment because I didn't really know how I had done it, and I don't really know if I could do it again.\n\nWhen you beat the Titan Souls, you unlock "HARD" mode and several other modifiers to make the game harder (like it needs to be harder), but I have ZERO interest in touching the game again. If I had paid $15 I'd probably be pretty disappointed, but for $6 (Steam Sale), I at least got some enjoyment out of it.\n\nTime to play another hundred hours of Spelunky...","December 29, 2015","false","2.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Yes,you get its soul but does it affect anything? Sadly no,you get literally nothing out of this.\n\nI also did not enjoy wandering a empty world that has nothing much interesting in it,they just act as a way between bosses.\n\nStory\n\nI think the makers did a good job on story,though i felt like adding some more 'clear' lore to it would be great.You just fight a titan that you know nothing about and be done with it.\n\nAtmosphere\n\nI really enjoyed the Titan Souls' atmosphere. The music,the graphics were very nice. I think the atmosphere part is the strongest part of the game. But still,the world feels a bit dead.\n\nDifficulty\n\nYes,the game is very difficult,you get hit one time,and you are dead. Difficulty is more about dying to a boss and trying to memorize its pattern,with some luck in it.\n\nReplayability\n\nThe game has a bunch of unlocked game modes after you beat it,but i didn't feel like playing the game again after finishing it.\n\n\nOverall\n\nThis game is not a bad game but rather feels kind of incomplete.

I will change this to a thumbs up review if they update the game so that you can instant retry a boss or retry starting from a point very near the boss door.\n\nThis is a game where the bosses are intentionally very difficult, where you die if you get hit only once, so you die CONSTANTLY and REPEATEDLY and OFTEN, but every time you die, you have to walk ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE BOSS CHAMBER. At first you dont mind. The bosses are challenging and exciting and they are really great quality fights.\n\nBut in a game where the player is EXPECTED to die many many times, I do not understand the purpose of making the player tediously walk all the way back to the point of retry again, and again, and again. It's such a small thing, but it really is kind of a big deal. It's like playing Super Meat Boy, but every time you die, you get kicked back out to the main menu. Would SMB still be a great game if that were true? That's kind of the situation we're dealing with here.\n\nI will change to recommended INSTANTLY as soon as retries are no longer a pain.","February 5","false","0.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Except, the game is... not fun.\n\nI love challenging games, games that are merciless, cruel, and whip you.  It makes victory that much more satisfying and rewarding.\n\nTitan souls?  No, it isn't challenging.  It wears the APPEARANCE of challenge.  The bosses are basically 90% luck 10% skill.  Everytime I beat a titan, save for the first couple, it doesn't feel satisfying.  It just feels like you got lucky.  After a dozen tries, this time the arrow was 'drawn just enough' and the angle was 'just enough' for the game to recognize it as on target.\n\nThe trick to the titans is obvious, so you don't feel smart for figuring it out.  Getting to the titans is frustratingly slow.  Firing your arrow is frustratingly slow.  Getting your arrow back is frustratingly slow.  Dying and getting another crack at a Titan is frustrating slow.\n\nThe game and the mechanics are identical from start to finish.  So traversing the big and open world, while pretty and with a nice atmosphere, gets very boring, very quickly.  I was pretty pumped to get this game, but after about 10 titans in, i'm done, it's got nothing left to offer.\n\nDon't waste your time, just replay Shadow of the Colossus on PS2.","December 15, 2015","false","2.0"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

Yes the world is beautiful and elegant which fits with the minimalistic gameplay style that defines the experience. That said this game demands the most from you without it giving you the most back. There are many design flaws with this title that produce counter intuitive logic. It's not fulfilling to die for reasoning you presume to be consistent with the games logic only to find that you entirely wasted your time. You will often try mistaken ideas that seem logically possible but aren't, whilst the game does nothing to steer you away from that kind of reasoning.\n\nAnyone who has played this game without a guide knows exactly what I'm talking about from the illogical arrow does damage when returning (yet not to you?!) to often illogical boss weakness which turn out to be nothing but aesthetic choices rather than gameplay dynamics. The game records your death count and when you combine that with the inconsistent design there's a real dilution of the sense of achievement there could be here when you finally kill a Titan. A feeling you may feel like jumping  for joy in achievement but reflecting back it often feels out of sheer luck that you got your arrow off than any kind of skill.\n\nTechnically this game optimization is very poor It struggles immensely with alt tab not to mention the games clueless ability to understand resolution formats getting them often entirely wrong. I've also had game crashes and artifacting from alt tabbing in which the prior screens elements are left behind. This with an options menu that is overall very lacking which would be more acceptable if the standard price wasn't so high at 11£.\n\nOverall this is a cool game just not a good one but I really hope they take what they have here expand it and tighten up all of its potentially great aspects. Right now it feels like an unrewarding and often empty relationship, to which the netgain of the experience feels one of loss in terms of your time especially when there are superior titles out there like the Shadow of the Colossus. For now watching the game is far more enjoyable than playing it to its underwhelming conclusion, lets hope in the future the next title can rectify that.","December 26, 2015","false","7.6"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

It's too bad you only hear about 2-10 seconds of any particular boss song.\n\nDespite everything it has going for it, and how much I wanted to love this game, I simply cannot recommend it.\n\nThe first four boss fights got me so excited for the rest of the game. Excellent, 95% skill-based boss battles? What's not to love? It soon became apparent that the game was turning itself into an exercise in tedium. Boss arenas got further and further away from the checkpoints. Bosses killed you without warning in a matter of seconds. It takes about 15-20 seconds of walking per death to reach a boss room. I expect the average total death count for a first playthrough to be somewhere around 150-200 times. That's a lot of unnecessary backtracking.\n\nAt first glance, and maybe about an hour into the game, it can easily be likened to something like Dark Souls or Shadow of the Colossus. In practice, however, it ends up playing more like I Wanna Be The Guy. The amount of split-second coordination doesn't reward a quick wit and clever decision-making; it grants death. You die, you die again, and continue dying until you get a lucky shot and come out on top. It doesn't feel satisfying to win against a boss knowing that you haven't really gotten any better at the game. It feels cheap.\n\nTitan Souls set out to be an exciting adventure, and it has all the trappings of one.

It's EXTREMELY tedious, all thanks to how much walking you have to do. The game world is way too large and is the sole reason why my experience was padded out to about 2 hours. As other reviewers have noted as well, until the end of the game, all of the checkpoints spawn you a good distance away from your enemy, forcing you to walk all the way to the boss room every time you want to retry.\n\nThere's no real reward for progressing or even beating the game, either. All you really get are three modes that just make the game more difficult/frustrating/unfun, and for beating the final boss, some text is translated, like boss intro blurbs. Nope, there's no unlockable bosses, weapons, locations, nothing. Yay..?\n\nThere's no real replay value either. As previously stated, the three modes you get for beating the game only make the game harder and more frustrating. Like a no-roll run, a hard mode that screws with previously successful strategies, and a mode that only gives you one life that uses the hard mode changes. Considering you die in one hit and some of the bosses can be EXTREMELY cheap (changing their patterns on a whim, bad hitboxes, etc), you can already see where that'd go.\n\nThere's barely any story other than what's on the store page for the game, and a very short and vague dialogue sequence that many players won't even see (which locks them out of the final boss). Hell, the entire game is extremely vague and gives you barely any reason to care about trudging onward. At least in a story-starved game like The Binding of Isaac, the genesis Sonic games, or the first Hotline Miami, the fun of the gameplay keeps you going. Here, you're given next to no direction and a Gainax Ending that really doesn't tie up anything or explain anything.\n\nThe music is okay, but it's mostly generic fantasy tunes similar to what you've probably heard a million times before in other fantasy titles, such as those from Bioware or Bethesda. Personally, most of it does give me a pleasant Neverwinter Nights vibe. The art direction is also alright, but some of the monsters seem lazily designed or just look out of place. Some other parts of the game look rather low-effort as well, such as a river in the hub area.\n\nThis is definitely a sale game, and not worth the $14.99. It's easily beatable in about 2 hours, and there's really no reason to come back to it. By the time you beat it, you're already burnt out, frustrated, unsatisfied, and wishing it was something better. For $14.99, this is wasted potential. If it were like $4.99 or something, then it'd definitely be worth a buy.","February 29","false","2.5"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

Am I evil? Are these things evil? Is this just some sport? I don't know.\n\nThe game gives no context to any of my actions. There is no exposition to explain what all of this is. There are no changes to the world whenever a monster is killed. There are no powers gain from killing these monsters directly or indirectly. It doesn't even build my character: the same boring unskippable cutscene plays every time I defeat a monster. Maybe when I defeat the monster with the heart, I should gain my own heart, but no, I just gain this white goo and rays shoot out of my stomach. Maybe I don't want rays to shoot out of my stomach.\n\nWhy, when I die, do I have to do walk through the same path again? Because the environment never changes, this is just a repetitive action. The lack of context to having to walk back means I don't feel remorse, but frustration at the game. Why do I respawn sometimes on an elevator on the switch so it moves me back to the previous zone? What the hell, game?\n\nThe highlight of the game is the mechanics of the monster fights. Each one of them has a trick, which when you figure it out, you can defeat them quickly. But, it is marred by having to walk back to the monster room each time you die with one hit. That time not fighting bosses is time wasted.\n\nIf this game is about just boss fights, make it about boss fights. Put everything in a menu. There's no reason why half my time should be spent staring at the same background art.","March 26","false","0.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

There are parts that are almost impossible to do with just a keyboard.\n\nWhat about the actual game? Well, if you like having absolutely no difficulty curve, this is your game. You need to be able to pick up the mechanics fast in order to have any fun, otherwise you'll be constanly dying almost immediately, since basically any attack that hits will instantly kill you. And while dying might not be much of an annoyance at first, the longer you go on the more the game ends up being 40% loading screens, 45% transit between the respawn point to the boss room, 12% actually fighting the boss, 1% exploration, and 2% watching the boss smash your corpse over and over to add insult to injury.\n\nAs far as the gameplay goes, you play as a puny weak little human with a bow and a single arrow that you can force pull towards you after it is fired. You use these to fight various bosses in rooms of various layouts and sizes reflecting the residing boss, and must use its attack pattern and your environtment to either get past the boss's defenses or hit its weakspot. This can be accomplished by directly firing your arrow at your enemy or by hitting it while you draw your fired arrow towards you. It's similar to being a top-down 2D Shadow of the Colossus, except all of the Colossi are the annoying, smaller, fast colossi, now with multiple methods of attack and where you simply have to observe their behavior for a few lives to figure out what to do. The primary challenge is simply in properly executing your plan without being slaughtered within seconds of activating the boss, which is very, very hard.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't mind the game so much if you respawned in the boss room, cutting out one of the loading times and all the time you spend in transit, and if it was optimized more for use with a keyboard and not just a controller. If it wasn't for those issues I feel I could really enjoy the game.","January 19","false","2.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mercury_zero/recommended/297130/","mercury_zero","Mercury","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mercury_zero/","639 products in account","Before you buy this game, be warned: it's nothing but boss battles.\n\nI can't say I didn't spend a lot of this game really enjoying myself. It has interesting visuals, lovely music, and it was a delight trying to work out the puzzles behind the bosses, but when I say 'it's nothing but boss battles,' I mean that.\n\nThe world feels lifeless. There's some artistic symbolism that someone may be tempted to call a story, but there are no characters, no motivation, no development, no choices. I consider it a missed opportunity. Lots of effort was put into making the world pretty and interesting, but nothing even hints at the motivations of whatever it is that put all these things here for you to interact with. There is also no arc either. When you first land in the game you're doing exactly the same stuff that you're doing in the middle and at the end of the game.\n\nEven Super Mario Bros. had more emotional engagement than this. At least it had an understandable goal to go along with its pretty visuals and artistic landscape. In this game you're given an arrow and you have the opportunity to murder everything in sight, if you want, and that's pretty much the extent of it. You murder eighteen things and you're done. You don't get an ending.\n\nLet me repeat that. This game doesn't have an ending. You see a defeat animation of the final boss, hear some wooshy sound effects, and then the credits roll.\n\nNormally I'd be fine with a game that wants to be pure and have no story at all. I don't have any similar complaints about Tetris or Solitaire, but this game is different. It teases the player with unfulfilled hints at a story that isn't there.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, I found that I very much enjoyed the difficulty level, but the biggest complaint I had was the punishment for failure. You have to stroll back to the boss chamber from the nearest save point, and then rejoin the battle, at which point absolutely nothing has changed.\n\nWhen you resume combat with the boss, you're back in the exact same battle with exactly the same number of hits remaining (one), and with the exact same number of hits remaining for the enemy (one), so effectively there is no punishment at all for dying except for having to take a tedious walk, sometimes up to fifteen seconds. The game could have spawned you just outside the door, but it doesn't, and often, you spend way more time walking back to the arena than you do actually fighting the boss.\n\nAnd just as there is no penalty for dying, there's no reward for winning, except that you get to see a short animation. It's the same animation every time, except for the final boss, which is slightly grander, but has an identical theme. That's the animation I mentioned before that plays before the credit roll.\n\nIf you do choose to buy this game, I hope that this helps you. Don't get invested in the lovely world and interesting circumstances. Don't assume you will get a narrative payoff for all the hard work you invest into beating all the bosses. You'll be disappointed if you do.","February 12","false","4.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This is what drew me to the game in the first place. Titan Souls falls short of it's inspirations though, and it's mostly down to the pacing, and the perspective.\n\nPacing first; it's pretty bad. You're just going room to room, fighting boss after boss. The boss-only thing can work well, it was stunning in SotC. There's no exploration here though, no motivation even (why am I doing this?), no build-up... The game feels very flat as a result, compartmentalized and hard to lose yourself in. A big deal, I think.\n\nOkay, onto perspective. I don't mean in this in a 2d/3d or top-down/over-the-shoulder sense. Just that in SotC and Dark Souls, there are staggeringly large things to fight, but these games first show a world that is scaled to suit you. The awe/horror/wonder comes from encountering something that exists outside of your frame of reference. In Titan Souls, these "giant" boses take up as much screen real estate as you would expect the player character to. They appear to exist in stasis til you approach them; they're just... there. Sat in their sterile, square rooms, with no indication of purpose, no backstory implied. Maybe if the boses were more interesting, this would be less of an issue. So far though, I've fought a slime, a cube, and a different kind of cube, and I am just done at this point.\n\nI'm sure the game would reveal more of it's world over time, and I'm sure it's saving more interesting bosses for later encounters. I'm past caring though. The art is lovely, and some of the combat dynamics are interesting, but this feels like half a game. The incentiveless opening and uninspired first few fights have exhausted the good will that Titan Souls' art-style and influences had inspired. I'm uninstalling it now.","March 22","false","0.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The world isn't the real problem though, it's the respawning after dying (and it happens a lot).\nThe game would be greatly improved by respawning you right outside the boss room like Hyper Light Drifter.  It doesn't do that though, you have to fade in, re-walk 5-45 seconds to the boss room, watch the bosses intro, and then try to not die in 2 seconds (you die in 1 hit in this game).  The gameplay and bosses are actually fun too, which makes it all the more annoying that the game is ruined . . .\n\nWhat I would personally change:\n-Respawn right outside the boss door where you died (or let the player pitch a tent where they wanna respawn)\n-Gradually increase your run speed with continual running (or just blink into speed run after a time like Okami)\n\nThis game would literally be fun to me with just those small changes.

You shoot a single arrow from a bow, and you can't shoot again until you get the same arrow back. You can hold the shoot button after you fired the arrow and it will slowly move back toward you. If an enemy hits you, you die instantly and go back to a checkpoint. Everything is designed just to make it a pain in the rear to play. They could've done a few other things to make it even more of a chore, like making it so when you press left you go right, and when you press down, you go up, etc., but the developer hit the nail on the head for misery, so no need to step it up any further.\n\nAside from the annoying one arrow situation, you can roll, you can shoot an arrow, and you can run a bit. You walk into a room, a large monster attacks you, and you try to kill it before it hits you one time and you have to do the whole thing over. I'm fairly certain that's the whole game. Rooms spaced apart which you can pick from, each containing a different monster that wants to one-hit-kill you.\n\nThe good news is that with Steam refunds, you should know if you cannot stand this game within about 5 to 10 minutes of starting. If playing games with 90s-looking graphics that are designed just to be difficult and little else, then Titan Souls might just be for you!

Playing through it is decently enjoyable. The fights are diffcult and intense, and figuring out how to beat each boss feels like a small puzzle. The art style looks very nice and the music and controls (if played with a gamepad) are decent as well.\n\nThat said, the game has serious issues. The one-hit-death mechanic makes the fights intense, but taking up to a minute to walk to the boss again after you've really becomes tedious after you've done so a million times. Some fights are also extremely anti-climactic in the opposite way, where you kill the boss in under 5 seconds.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shymain/recommended/297130/","Shymain","Shymain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shymain/","71 products in account","Titan Souls is an amazing game. It has been a great experience playing it, and I'm nowhere close to done at 9.2 hours. There are two main parts to this review: Firstly, responses to some common complaints, and secondly, the review of the game itself.\n\nResponses\nWow. Some of these reviews make me doubt humanity itself -- not because they're negative, but because so many of them are stupid. One by one, let's go over them.\n\n"This game doesn't have enough puzzler/RPG elements in it."\n\nContrary to semi-popular opinion, this is not an RPG nor a puzzler, but an action-adventure game. While I agree that the few elements they added in were nice, and I would have liked more of it, it's not obligated to have features from other genres. This complaint was reasonable, compared to the others, at the very least.\n\n"The game makes you walk too far to bosses."\n\nFor the majority of bosses, I found you could reach them in under 10 seconds from the closest save point. There were two that you couldn't, Onyxia and Avarice, and they were both around 15 seconds total. Yes, I get that you die a lot -- but it's a purposeful decision to make you have to walk back. Do you know why that time is there? It's because you're supposed to be thinking about what to do next. That's what I did -- the first couple fights with the boss, I would roll around and try to survive while figuring out the pattern, and when I died, I took the time walking back to try and fomulate my strategy for the next time.\n\n"The boss battles are easy to figure out, but are hard to execute."\n\nIf you can't execute correctly, you haven't figured the battle out. It's pretty obvious what the weak spots are, and if they're hidden, it's also decently obvious as to how you expose them. The strategy part isn't about figuring that out -- in fact, if you don't quickly figure out the weak spot, you might want to have your head examined for brain damage. The strategy part is in figuring out how to work with and manipulate the mechanics of the boss battles so that you can defeat the bosses.\n\n"The game requires a controller."\n\nNo, it really doesn't. I get the annoyance at not divulging that using a controller is a better choice before buying the game, but it really isn't required. I beat the whole game on normal mode using the keyboard controls, and then with a Dualshock 4. Now, I am a WASD person, so much so that I remapped my whole keyboard when playing Undertale so that I could use WASD instead of arrow keys. This game isn't so hard that you can't use a keyboard. That being said, control customization is always a preferred feature to have.\n\nActually, wait, that's only partially true. You'll be royally screwed if you try hard mode with anything other than a controller, I would guess. Haven't actually tried yet, as I'm using my controller to do so.\n\n"We should be able to use a mouse."\n\nNo. You should not. Part of the difficulty of the game is planning the execution of the battles. being able to click on your target is basically an aimbot in this case, as opposed to just pointing in a direction. A mouse would make the battles significantly easier than they were designed to be.\n\n"There's no story."\n\nYeah, because it's not a narrative-driven game. That being said, there actually is a hidden story, if you care to uncover it.\n\n"You/The Enemy dies with one shot!"\n\nThat's integral to the concept of the game. It's a rather good concept, in my opinion.\n\n"You have to pull back your arrow!"\n\nThat's integral to the concept of the game. It's a rather good concept, in my opinion.\n\n"It's SO SHORT!"\n\n*Glances at time played*\n\nNo, it really isn't, unless you're just playing it once through. If you are, then sure. 2.5 hours will be about right for you. The game is fun enough that I enjoy replaying it, hard mode takes FREAKING FOREVER, and the achievements are moderately difficult to get and fun to try and get. I have 9 hours of gameplay, and I'm not stopping anytime soon.\n\nYeah, that's about it for complaints. I may update this.\n\nMy Review\nWhat is there to say? This is an all-around excellent game, in my opinion. The art is amazing -- although, that may just be because I have a love of really good pixel art -- the soundtrack is very good, and adds a whole layer of atmosphere to the game, and the gameplay is fun, if infuriating at times. (To be fair, I get angry pretty easily.) I think the concept behind the game is great, having the one-shot kill be mutual, and having only one arrow that we can use. Limiting gameplay like this is always interesting, and fun when executed well, like this.\n\nThe bosses are excellent, unique, and fun to fight. True, there are maybe two pairs of bosses that have similarities (one of those intentionally), but it's no big deal in my opinon, as they are noticably different. The fights themselves are awesome, being very strategic and action-packed at the same time, which is always a great combination. This was a game that really made me think about what I was doing.\n\nI guess I could say more, but there really isn't much more I need to say. So I'll leave this here -- who knows? Maybe I'll update this at some point.","January 9","true","20.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Now to make the people happy who are *itching about my thoughts on it and said I did not give a legit review of it. here you go: The game is super short you fight 19 bosses total (less if you know a certain way around it to skip them to go straight to the boss after a certain point) both you & the bosses are always one hit kills and I still run into glitches while fighting some bosses for example cliping into the giant ice block when trying to dodge roll away from it and getting stuck in the block until you clip out or die and it feels like I'm playing a beta or early access game and felt like I'm waiting for the rest of the game to come in a update and the fact that you can't use mouse and keys for this is just dumb for a PC to not have mouse and keys support and if you don't have a xbox 360 or PS4 controller it becomes unplayable.

Now I can't really fault the game for being too hard, I'm sure my lack of skill is partly to blame. Even so, this game will take a lot out of you.\n\nLet's start with my only real substational complaint: The respawn times. While I understand that the game is meant to be thought-provocing and atmospheric, every time you die, you have to wait a second or so before the screen fades to black, and then another few seconds before the screen fade in again, now at your last checkpoint. This might not sound like much, but the battles are incredibly fast-paced and intense, and you can only take one single hit before dying. This means that respawning REALLY breaks up the gameplay, and often. Perhaps the long wait was meant as a punishment for dying, but it made me mad at the game rather than myself, even if I did fault myself for my death. You can assume that .4 of my 4.4 hours were spend waiting for the game to let me play again.\n\nSo! Now that that one complaint is out of the way, let's praise the game a bit, shall we? The Titans are diverse, and while defeating each one can take many, many frustrating tries, doing so is quite rewarding in the end. The game looks gorgeous, a real treat for any pixelart lover. The music is also fantastic, doing a great job of setting a more calming mood outside of battle, and having a varied library of Titan Themes. That's what I'm calling them.\n\nNow, I'll be frank and say I only got through the game all the way to the true final boss out of sheer unwillingness to let this relentlessly difficult piece of virtual entertainment beat me, and near the end I was mostly incredibly frustrated, but as I've said before, this was at least partly due to my own ineptitude. But in the end, it felt incredibly rewarding. The true final boss will likely stick with me for months to come.\n\nTitan Souls offers a challenge. A real challenge, one that doesn't last too long, but it'll feel like a terrible eternity. And when you finally beat it, you'll be glad you did. Just be prepared to get very, very angry.","June 19, 2015","true","4.4"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","17","32","0","0"

The concept of a 1 hit kill game could be really awesome but I found myself feeling tired and cheated rather than invigorated and callenged, and this is coming from someone whose favourite game is dark souls. The gameplay consists of boss after boss, with little to nothing inbetween except pretty landscapes, all of which can 1 hit you with any of their billion hurtboxes all of which guard their hitbox which you must hit at least 3 times. I really wanted to like this game because you can see the love that's been poured into it, but after multiple attempts I've resolved to deleting it from my library; officially giving up. All round this game was a saddening and frustrating experience. The graphics are alright though, somewhat clunky in parts but all over an interesting feel. It just felt like "difficulty" was favoured over gameplay.

The game is basically a boss rush which is fine, but for some reason it  loves to waste your time by having you run to the bosses each and every time you die. There is no reason for this. There are no puzzles to be solved or enemies to be beaten, you just respawn at a point and have to walk to the boss again. It doesn't sound that bad, but trust me: Having to run to a boss, even if it just takes 10 seconds, feels like a huge chore after you died ten times to a boss.

Now I haven't played SotC, but I thought I would try this game out since it looked interesting! OMG I was right.This game is simply amazing.\n\nThe game starts with you waking up in a large unkown area and your job is to go around and defeat a bunch of different and challenging bosses, just like SotC.\nThe game is a heavy trial and error genre, since you have to keep replaying bosses to find their weak spot. The bosses only die in one hit but so do you. This in turn makes it incredibely satisfying when you finally defeat a boss.\n\nOne problem I had with the game was that it was really difficult to find your way around in the beginning. I get that the game incurres exploration, but I just found the map a little too huge. It didn't take long before I got tired of this and then I decided to follow a guide to find my way around and it was so much better. It is recommended to try to kill the bosses without a guide though, since it kinda kills the point of the game, but feel free to use a guide for exploring\n\nIn conclusion the game is really great and immensely satisfying to complete, but before of the difficulty. The navigation problem nowhere near makes the game bad","May 18","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The best way too think of it is this,   zelda but only boss and one weapon.  The weapon is a spear that you can throw then pull back too you. This game is vary hard and you die a lot.  It is very satisfying to finally kill a boss but what ruined the game for me was the walk back to the boss. Every boss requires learning his moves and his weakness and dying a lot in the process. So the walk back over and over again, I suspect, may equal or surpass the time actually spent fighting the boss. I don't understand why you couldn't respawn in the boss' chamber.    The walk back means you can't get right back in the action.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blendvai/recommended/297130/","blendvai","da  B man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blendvai/","408 products in account","I see a lot of bad reviews for this game that make NO sense, what-so-ever. If you read them please consider one thing: This game was made for a generally masochistic audience. These people have never played games of this genre, this genre is pseudo-masochistic RPG... like dark souls, salt and sanctuary, etc... Some of them actually had the balls to complain about dying in 5 seconds yet spending 20 seconds running to the boss, HAHAHA, I guess they never played shadow of the colossus(a game that had clear influence over this one). The game doesn't pat you on the back for finding the keyboard. In the hour time or so that I've played and explored the game, I beat the first 4 bosses and was amazed at the size of the game, thereafter. From the reviews I was expecting it to be a short and sad experience, but I guess they never managed to kill the first bosses because the areas become VERY large and amazing afterwards. The game is very simple. You die in one hit, but you also kill in one hit. The trick is you have to hit bosses at a very specific time. I've only stumbled onto bosses, and I haven't had any sort of alteration with levels, gear, or weapons. But I also haven't seen any alteration to difficulty, which was pleasing, since health doesn't seem to go up. Every boss is equally as hard depending on how skilled you are with timing. This game rewards you for having a quick reaction time, and the ability to spot extraordinary yet sensical details(weaknesses). You are only given a few seconds with a boss at a time to get a grasp of his movement and attack animations before you die, so if you're the type of person who is rather squeamish as 90% of these reviewers seem to be, then perhaps check out youtube instructions on when to attack. This will make your gameplay a lot more enjoyable. Or you could go the route the developers intended and simply spend a little extra time dying to figure out a strategy for you. P.S. The cube boss on the first level has an achievement for being killed by running into his eye with your arrow arched back ;) Hope you enjoy this massive boss-hunter as much as I did!","June 2","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It just feels like it's difficulty for difficulty sake. And some of the boss mechanics feel borderline unfair. It'd all be worth it if there were some kind of feeling of progress after you defeat a boss, but instead it's just "oh, I gained a soul." And as far as I can tell, that's just a counter that gets incremented. After 4 or 5 bosses, it felt like no progress character or story wise. So I was just left wondering why I should bother with the frustration of these bosses.\n\nOn paper, it's a great idea: take old school Zelda-ish mechanics, retro pixel graphics, and apply them to a Shadow of the Colossus/Dark Souls type world. However, those games had story depth, gameplay depth, and/or character progression. Whereas this game has little to keep you around when the boss fights begin to feel frustrating.\n\nPerhaps I missed the narrative or maybe I didn't find the gameplay aspect where my character gains levels/abilities. As is, I think the only people who should pick this up are those who really like difficult games and/or pixel graphics. Otherwise, save your time and energy for a game that has more to offer to the player.","December 2, 2015","false","0.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you like it and want more, go for it. Just be warned that the rest of the game is a dozen more bosses and about 10 minutes of map exploration. Strongly recommend you get this on sale.\n\nLong Version: This is a pretty short, but challenging game. You're basically just walking around a fairly small world map until you find a checkpoint, and from there you'll find 2-3 boss rooms in the immediate area. 16 main bosses total, plus 1 hidden boss (your reward for exploring the full map and finding a single hidden path) and the final boss on Hard Mode\n\nThe boss fights are a good challenge. Each boss is unique, and they feel more like a puzzle than an endurance challenge. If you can avoid a bosses attacks long enough to discover it's only weakness, you are then tasked with figuring out how to exploit the weakness. Once you figure out a strategy, it's only a matter of executing it perfectly. Most the bosses only take one hit to kill, but getting that hit in is an excercise in gamepad finesse. So you might fight a boss 20 times, but when you do finally kill it, it'll be in the first 5 seconds of battle.\n\nI beat the game in just over 2 hours. Beating it unlocks 3 more levels of difficulty: Hard Mode (faster bosses, harder tactics), Iron Mode (no death run), and No Run No Roll Mode (sheah right, as if). I'll try Hard Mode, but likely I'll put the game down permanently before I finish it.\n\nI would only recommend this game if it's on sale. I paid $4 for it and feel like that was a good price. If I paid full price I would be pretty annoyed at how short this game is and how little content there is. Aside from the bosses (which are definitely well done and this games only real selling point), there is only a single puzzle that you use your bow & arrow for - and it's the sort of challenge you get in the very first puzzle room in a Zelda game. There's really no story to speak of at all. There's a few lines of dialogue, but it doesn't have any context, so it's kind of dumb and pointless. The developers could have done a lot more with the map (there's a good number of designs and mysterious carvings here and there: why not some text to help build a story?).","March 18","true","2.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's gorgeous.\n- Interesting Bosses --> about 20 bosses and almost all different paterns.\n- Good music --> yeah the music is well made but.. (see bellow)\n\n\nAnd the bad points :\n- No story at all ! --> There is games where you don't need it because their game mecanics don't allow it (take Towerfall as exemple) . But here in Titan Souls, it is clearly made to support a story ! Even a really symple one. Just something to gives you a purpose in the game... Otherwise you're just a bloke wandering around in an empty world... As it is right now...\n- Having the Roll and Run on the same button is just a pain in the ♥♥♥ ! --> you can't really control your character if you have two different actions on the same button !\n- The music --> While the music is very good, you don't have time to listen to it cause you often die 10-20secondes after it starts...\n\nI feel like this game would have been better if you could bear a few hits and had to kill the Titans in 2-3 hits. You would have more time to learn it's pattern, and more time to hear the music and more time to really get into the game.\n\nOtherwise, some achievements are interesting to get, others are completly impossible..\nDunno if I'll do a new playthrough for this game..

Great, right? Oh, but you have 1 hitpoint.\n\nThe visuals and music create a fantastic atmosphere, which is a huge shame given the excessively rigid gameplay design.\n\nI remember when the original 'Ludum Dare' version came out awhile back and I played it. Even though it was just as difficult, it was a small demo that showed a lot of potential. Unfortunately, they didn't move from their original design whatsoever and therefore you die in one hit against every single boss, and then have to trek your way back to the boss. Every. Single. Time. They give you a few checkpoints, but what does it matter if it still results in spending more time getting to the bosses than you do fighting them?\n\nMore specifically, the real problem is there is very little sense of progression. In Dark Souls (for example), even though it technically takes longer to reach the bosses than it does to fight them, there's significant opportunities for progression. You can explore the area for loot, shortcuts, and characters; you can learn how to best avoid or confront the obstacles along the way; and perhaps most importantly, you can take time to study AND appreciate the boss fight most of the time without fear of dying in a few seconds. Not to mention, you can change your loadout for the fight however you desire. I'm not saying that Titan Souls needs all these things of course. But it simply has very little progression and the bosses are very aggressive and fast. You keep flinging yourself against them until you get that perfect shot, without really any change to speak of other than hoping that your reflexes and accuracy are what the fight is demanding.\n\nI noticed a very questionable design choice...the character runs by holding A, but there's no reason to ever want to walk. Every single boss has relatively quick movements and running is a strictly better alternative, especially since you get killed in one hit. Having the option to roll is nice, but they should have made "running" the default movement. Now I'll admit that I purposely have been avoiding spoilers but out of the 10 or so bosses that I fought, I didn't see any moment where walking proved useful. Without a stamina bar of some kind (which would make the current game even more difficult), having to hold down a button to move faster feels like a needless formality.\n\nThe animation that happens when you kill a boss is exactly the same every time, and unskippable unless you exit the game. And what are their souls giving me exactly? Certainly not more health, speed, or power. So, then why so much fanfare with the animation?\n\nI do applaud the developers for at least offering a demo, something a lot of developers nowadays sadly neglect. Even so, after the demo I bought it somehow hoping for a more wholesome experience, so temper your expectations.\n\nIf you mostly like the art and music (which again, are great), I really recommend just watching a speedrun or let's play instead of buying this.","January 1","false","1.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

As music is a very personal point at least I can say (as being a musician myself) that the music fits to the overall atmosphere of the game.\n\n-The graphics are beautiful compared to other top down games from this century (such as hero siege, relic hunters zero, hotline miami 2, etc.)\n\nNow lets get to the gameplay. I played it with the keyboard and had no complains about the controls. I wont describe how the mechanics are in detail but rather point out the results out of them.\n\n-It feels smooth to run around the world and shoot and so on\n\n-Depending on what boss you are on it feels more or less lucky to kill one. For some bosses i was disappointed that it worked, for others it felt just great and satisfying\n\n-You learn the tactic of each boss by dying to them several times before even discovering their weakness. This can be annoying as for some bosses it takes too many deaths or more likely too much time. This phase of the bossfight is the most disputable one in my opinion for as you know how to kill a boss the fight immediately depends only on your reaction and skill to bring it down and the game starts to get what it was ment for: fighting bosses and kill them (not discovering how to do that)\n\n-The respawn time is fair and the way to the boss is short enough\n\n-The overworld is relatively big but its the perfect size. You are completely alone in this world except for the titans. Hence an encounter makes the titan feel exalted and mighty and the main character just small and weak. This is a brilliant effect just reached by games like "Shadow Of The Colossus" and makes this big world worth exploring and the games atmosphere so magically\n\n-There is no real story in this game. This is a huge minus because you are willing to know why you are killing these titans and what is going on in general. At least there is some text appearing as you walk through the game that gives you the idea of what is happening but it is just too little to get this satisfying feeling of a progressing story. But this game does not rely on a story to thrive in atmosphere because the "not knowing" what is going on underlines the unsettling encounters with each titan\n\n-The Titans themselve are well crafted. Each has its own mechanic and the developers were pretty creative in making them all different\n\n-The game is really short with its 19 bosses\n\nThese are my impressions of Titan Souls. I would like to conclude by saying that this game is worth a try and is developed properly. BUT in relation to its length it is not worth its price at all! I bought in on sale and so should you do unless you are a complete fanboy of top-down-2d-pixel-graphics-boss-fight-games.\nAn adequate price in my opinion would be 7€/$.\nThanks for reading and excuse my bad english.","December 10, 2015","true","14.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

A try to recreate the feel of 'Shadow of the Colossus' and 'Dark Souls' fused together into one, 2-dimensional package. Sadly, it takes out the main ingredient of those 2 games: Fun. This game isn't fun, it's a chore. You know what to do, the bosses all have 1, very obvious weak-point, but it's very difficult to hit that singular point. You know why? Because playing with a keyboard makes this game absolutely unplayable. Yes, the developers recommend a controller, but I don't want to buy third-party hardware just to finish this game. That would be a waste of money, since finishing this game would be a waste of time. Anyways, back to the gameplay: The bosses are frustratingly hard, and since they serve as a tutorial, my motivation to finish this game has vanished extremely fast.\n\nWhat else is there besides the broken, barebones bossrush? A generic, boring, ugly and empty overworld to explore. Great.\n\nThe game looks okay, nothing special.\n\nThe music is okay as well.

The main gameplay involves fighting giant bosses in a 1HP style battle. You die after one hit, but so do the bosses. You strike by firing a single arrow, which you must then pick up if you miss, so every fight must be executed skillfully. I've seen others call this game a "puzzler", which I suppose is somewhat true. Part of the game is figuring out where exactly to strike the bosses to kill them. In some cases, this could not be clearer, but in others I found it more subtle.\n\nThis is no easy game, but I found the difficulty ultimately worth the payoff. The satfisfaction of experimenting many times in order to get it *just* right was very rewarding when successful. I won't lie, this game was frustrating at times, but I thought it was worth it. I've also seen people complain about the distance from the checkpoints to the boss. I see the validity here, but I also think that without this I would have just thrown myself at the bosses over and over. The risk caused me to play more cautiously and made each fight seem more meaningful.\n\nThe art deisgn and the music are especially spectacular, evoking something of an old-school top-down RPG aesthetic with a modern sensibility for design and color. Each boss has its own (I think) music, each of which really got the adrenaline pumping.\n\nUltimately, I think there's a lot that subjective here in terms of style, gameplay, and many other things this game does. Definitely not everyone's cup of tea and I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, but if you're looking for a difficult action game with memorable bosses, this one's for you.","February 23","true","4.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

As the title implies, it borrows heavily from Fromsoft's Souls series, but with a much more minimal aesthetic, and a shifted emphasis from combat to brainteasing. It scratched that masochistic itch well enough, but only for a shockingly brief 3 hours, and during that short time I encountered some problems greater than difficulty.\n\nTitan Souls focuses exclusively on the rush of victory following a particularly difficult boss; the entire game is composed only of wide open quiet stretches between bosses that will test your resolve to perservere. They have one critical weakness, exposed for desperately short moments, which one must first identify before striking. So when my wild shot between frantic dodges finally connected, it took my breath away without fail.\n\nThat said, it was quite a trial of patience to reach victory, and some foes fell on the wrong side of unreasonable. I confess, I had to look up the weakness to one, and to this day I'm still not entirely sure how I beat the final boss. So, Titan Souls is worth the price, barely, but only if you already own the controller that is impossible to play without.","March 7","true","3.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The full product disappoints. Why? It's bare bones. Titan Souls is a pretty, retro looking boss-rush type of a game. Your character has one weapon (a bow) and dies from one hit. The task is to fight and win with all 19 boss creatures. Most of them require from You to find and plant your arrow in their... weak spot. It's fun, but those simple mechanics get boring very quickly. There's no real reward for winning, no leveling, no new abilities. Bosses look great, but figuring them out takes a minute or two. Then starts the frantic battle to hit there weak spot, often resulting in chance, not skill. With no real progression or reward, Titan Souls loses it's charm. I couldnt get myself to play that game. It tries to be a 2D version of Dark Souls in it's vague storytelling (or rather non-existing storytelling) and high, unforgiving difficulty. In the end, it's a failure.

The gameplay is all about trying to get the one shot off needed to kill the various bosses before they get you. Instead of making fighting them interesting, it just becomes a repetitive game of hoping to have everything align to actually hit the small weakpoint. There is no reason to explore outside of finding the bosses and the whole game is very short for its price.\n\nI would wait for a massive sale and then spend an afternoon to play through the whole thing.","June 19, 2015","false","2.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/simplymatt/recommended/297130/","simplymatt","SimplyMatt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/simplymatt/","184 products in account","The game takes its inspiration primarily from Shadow of the Colossus and Dark Souls; I personally believe they're great games. Mechanically, The largest influce those two titles have had on Tital Souls is 1) the level of difficulty and 2) the boss-fight based style of SotC.\n\nNow, within the original games these aspects are used near flawlessly; however Titan Souls become stuck largely because of it's scope.\nThe reason Dark Soul's diffulty and challenge works so well as a gameplay point is that due to the complexity of the game and variety of things to do eventually overcoming the challenges it throws at you is rewarding. Killing the first boss, or even first few enemies in that game is satisfying as it demonstates the players ability to learn and master the many systems the game incorperates. Titan Souls meanwhile offers little satisfaction is this regard as it is incredibly mechanically simplistic; you can walk, roll dash, fire a single arrow and have to retrive it in order to attack again; the use of all this isn't hard to grasp, you'll have done so before encountering the first enemy. To get a solid grip on Dark Soul's mechanics might take the better part of hours of gameplay. That's where the fun lies. Titan Souls offers a challenge in a similar elk to DS, but in such a condensed manner that it can feel like a repetative slog, as opposed to a bountiful system of intricate trials.\n\nMeanwhile, for Shadow of the Colossus, the game does boil down to largely consisting of just sixteen bosses, but it's everything that truly makes the game; the sprawling map to explore, along with the visual feast of it's unique graphics style. But, back in Titan Souls, the world offers little in the way of exploration outside of the bosses, with the map serving as a overworld map, linking the individual boss rooms together. And as for the graphics (and yes, they do have a certain charm) are not too dissimilar to the art style of numerous other games; leaving the world, in part, uninteresting to explore and venture into.\n\nAs a final point, I know how little I've played, but I've given it a go and seen the game and personally, it's just not for me. It has taken cues from some fantastic games that I hold in high regard, taken their essence, stripped it back into something so simplistic and acute the fun was left out.","March 15","false","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However, I've come out of the game feeling more frusterated than like I completed a fun, hard challenge. The art design is pretty pleasing to the eye,  the controls are nice and tight, and the music is pretty good.\nTitan Souls is a glorified one hit KO boss rush dressed up as a retro Shadow of the Colossus without any real feelings of progression. There is nothing else to do besides slaying Titans, and that's a real shame. There were many opportunities to hide nice secrets in the overworld, but since what it does have (murals) adds nothing to the combat or the game in general, it ends up being more disappointing.\nLorewise, it feels like a mess. It tries to be as vague as possible, and when you do find murals depicting what could be lore, it is meaningless and doesn't add anything to the game. There was a large mural in the Forest area that no matter how I looked at it, it meant absolutely nothing. There was no context.\nAs I've stated before, the overworld is empty. SotC made up for the large overworld by adding upgrades to health and stamina, but since Titan Souls has no health mechanic whatsoever, and the bosses are one hit KOs anyway, there is no point to the overworld except as acting as a hub between the actual game. So the more time I spent on the overworld, the more I got bored of it.\nMost of the bosses operate on a "Think Fast!" attack system. Where the boss will attack at ludicrous speed without giving any tell worthwhile. The amount of times I started the boss fight, only to get killed a second afterwards because I had no clue where the boss was landing an attack is too much. The game gets most of the difficulty from this. And while some bosses have a rest in between a combo, the rest is not longer than 1-2 seconds long. So anticipating the direction of the boss to how long you need to pull the arrow back and avoiding death at the same time, creates even more frusteration. It gives off an RNG/luck feeling, as you can't determine what direction the boss is going to face for its rest period.\nHitting the weak spot does also not guarentee a victory, as it takes into account how much momentum the arrow is going and which direction it's facing. I've shot multiple bosses with a weak point facing towards the screen, but it didn't connect because I was coming in at an angle. The attack has to be precise, and frame perfect, or else you die.\nAnd die, you will. I spent 4 hours for myplaythrough, and died around 250 times. This is where I started feeling like I was playing something like Super Meat Boy, but not as fast paced when it comes to death and respawn.\nI am in the firm belief that most of my time spent in Titan Souls was watching the area fade to black as the boss continue to pound my body, and waiting for me to be able to control my character again to head all the way back to the boss arena. The forest area was the most annoying, because you had to keep scrolling through multiple screens before arriving at the bosses once again.\nThere is no real prgression outside of the gates you open, of which there are only two. The first one opens after the first 4 bosses are destroyed, and then the second after the the rest. So there was no seeming forward progression because of that. If the gates were used to continue on to other stages instead of dumping you into the hubworld and final area, there may have been a bigger sense of momentum, but even then, character progression doesn't exist.\nThe game is less forgiving than Dark Souls, and I believe that's a bad thing. The one hp is more annoying than it should be. If you make one mistake, have fun going back to the boss arena.\nTitan Souls sounds really good on paper, but because of the lack of other mechanics to give it more body, the game is too short for what it could've been, and too frustrating. Makes me want to play SotC even more though, so there's that I guess.\nTL;DR-It's a glorfied one hit KO boss rush with too much walking in the 'menu.'","March 15","false","5.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's the fact that when you do DIE, you have to travel back to your murder scence and this takes time and effort and after your 3rd or 4th trek, it all becomes a total drag! No matter how expansive and mystical the landscape appears, on your 5th journey through the same area, you just start losing a connection with the game.

I expected a game that was entirely too short, too frustrating, and too unpolished to be worth its asking price of $15. So, I dutifully waited until the game went on sale for under $5, and went in with low expectations.\n\nThe result? I was surprised. Titan Souls is a pleasure to play. At its core is the exploration of a simple concept: what if the terrifying big bosses were just as fragile as you? Both you and your foe will die after one decent hit, although landing this one decent hit can be quite a challenge.\n\nYou have at your disposal a single, magical arrow that can be alternately shot, then retrieved by magically attracting it to the player. You can also run and roll to dodge enemy attacks. Both shooting and retrieving the arrow force you to stand still, and the arrow will fly further the longer you hold down the attack key. Titans also tend to be very quick and very aggressive, so even finding the time to get a shot in can be very difficult.\n\nThe Titans themselves are beautiful (and often quite clever) in their design. As I mentioned, the weak point of each Titan tends to be evident, but it often takes some thinking to force the Titan to expose its weakness. Sometimes just seeing its weak point can be challenging, as often Titans will kill the uninitiated player in a matter of seconds after commencing battle. But when everything comes together, that moment, when your arrow hits your opponent square in the weak point it was guarding so effectively, is indescribable!\n\nThe world is also beautiful, but a little dull. Titan Souls' greatest weakness is the delay between fighting Titans, in which the player watches his corpse be pounded by the last Titan, then respawn several seconds walk away from where the fight took place. Generally there was a delay of 10-20 seconds between losing a fight and challenging the Titan for a rematch.\n\nI often found that I didn't really mind, certainly not as much as other reviewers. Titan Souls is packaged so beautifully, with lush 2.5-3D pixel art and a gorgeous soundtrack. However, the purpose of these trimmings is clearly just to accentuate the stellar gameplay. In an industry obsessed with making games more like movies, it's a breath of fresh air!","November 29, 2015","true","5.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The visuals and soundtrack design are outstanding, however, the game is not without its flaws, ALAS, big ones:\n\n\n1- The camera: The camera will be fine for most of the game, UNLESS you fight against someone in a big arena, in that case the camera ALWAYS moves way too much and you might end up out of camera (happened to me several times). Its a real shame that this can be fixed so easily but it hinders your skills so much, even if its for under 5 seconds, those 5 seconds are easily the difference between win or defeat\n\n2- Rolling: In this game there are 2 buttons, both wich serve 2 functions when hold or just pressed. The movement one has the feature of making you able to run when you hold it, and when you press it you do a quick roll. The problem comes from the fact that speed is key in this game and you want to be running as much as possible. This however, places the spotlight into the problem that whenever you want to run, your character will first do a roll, wich is a long quick movement that you CANNOT stop nor change the direction of. Ive been killed way too many times because my character would roll into obvious danger instead of moving where i wanted him to go. Maybe this could have been a 3rd button.\n\n3- Keyboards: DO NOT -I REPEAT- DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME WITH A KEYBOARD. You use the movement controls to aim with your arrow, with an analog joystick that means you aim wherever you please, with a keyboard this means you are locked to 8 directions. This doesn't look like a big problem except for a few bunch of bosses, but still, one of those is the final boss, and its very obvious that if you, like me, played this with only a keyboard, you would have a better time playing with a joystick.\n\n\n\n\nOther than that, this game is beautiful, might not be worth 15 dollars tho, as you can finish it in 4-5 hours, but i bought it on a 75% discount and i enjoyed this way better than my 200 hours at MGS V: TPP.","November 26, 2015","true","4.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The rule of ones. You have one life, take one it and your dead. Each boss had a weakpoint, hit it, they are dead. You only have one arrow that you shoot from your bow and call back to you. This game is only about this concept, two fighting as equals. The entire game is fighting up to 18 entirely unqiue bosses, aka titans. Each one has there own concepts and weak points. Now, you will die, a lot. There is a lot of back tracking which is the main complaint people have with this game. I found it fine as it wasn't a long walking distance to the boss. The soundtrack is great and the pixel art is astonishing. I enjoy this game greatly. To add to challenge, 3 extra challenge modes plus 1 reveal mode add more content to the game. 8/10","January 27","true","6.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I expected a game that was entirely too short, too frustrating, and too unpolished to be worth its asking price of $15. So, I dutifully waited until the game went on sale for under $5, and went in with low expectations.\n\nThe result? I was surprised. Titan Souls is a pleasure to play. At its core is the exploration of a simple concept: what if the terrifying big bosses were just as fragile as you? Both you and your foe will die after one decent hit, although landing this one decent hit can be quite a challenge.\n\nYou have at your disposal a single, magical arrow that can be alternately shot, then retrieved by magically attracting it to the player. You can also run and roll to dodge enemy attacks. Both shooting and retrieving the arrow force you to stand still, and the arrow will fly further the longer you hold down the attack key. Titans also tend to be very quick and very aggressive, so even finding the time to get a shot in can be very difficult.\n\nThe Titans themselves are beautiful (and often quite clever) in their design. As I mentioned, the weak point of each Titan tends to be evident, but it often takes some thinking to force the Titan to expose its weakness. Sometimes just seeing its weak point can be challenging, as often Titans will kill the uninitiated player in a matter of seconds after commencing battle. But when everything comes together, that moment, when your arrow hits your opponent square in the weak point it was guarding so effectively, is indescribable!\n\nThe world is also beautiful, but a little dull. Titan Souls' greatest weakness is the delay between fighting Titans, in which the player watches his corpse be pounded by the last Titan, then respawn several seconds walk away from where the fight took place. Generally there was a delay of 10-20 seconds between losing a fight and challenging the Titan for a rematch.\n\nI often found that I didn't really mind, certainly not as much as other reviewers. Titan Souls is packaged so beautifully, with lush 2.5-3D pixel art and a gorgeous soundtrack. However, the purpose of these trimmings is clearly just to accentuate the stellar gameplay. In an industry obsessed with making games more like movies, it's a breath of fresh air!","November 29, 2015","true","5.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Get it for a great challenge.\n\nIf you are a fan of tense, fast-paced fights and single life-single kill mechanics, you'll enjoy this game.  The soundtrack is amazing, the world design is fantastic, and the bosses each feel great and unique.  That's all I really have to say, I loved this game through and through, and the extra achievements give each boss some replayability.  The background world has plenty of lore and world-building, even for a pixel-graphics game, and the story pretty is interesting once you can unlock the text.\n\nFor anyone put off by the negative reviews, most of those people haven't even beat the game.\n\nDon't believe them, each boss has its own mechanics and system.  You kill them all the same, because of course you do. You only have one bow and one magical arrow the entire game, which necessitates killing everything the same way.  But the ways in which you reveal a bosses weak point or have to excute the correct timing vary with each fight, and the game is anything but stagnant.  The game is a bit short on bosses, but unless you're a mechanical genius it'll take you several dozen deaths to clear them all, and then even more if you try a harder second playthrough.","November 29, 2015","true","7.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/simplymatt/recommended/297130/","simplymatt","SimplyMatt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/simplymatt/","184 products in account","The game takes its inspiration primarily from Shadow of the Colossus and Dark Souls; I personally believe they're great games. Mechanically, The largest influce those two titles have had on Tital Souls is 1) the level of difficulty and 2) the boss-fight based style of SotC.\n\nNow, within the original games these aspects are used near flawlessly; however Titan Souls become stuck largely because of it's scope.\nThe reason Dark Soul's diffulty and challenge works so well as a gameplay point is that due to the complexity of the game and variety of things to do eventually overcoming the challenges it throws at you is rewarding. Killing the first boss, or even first few enemies in that game is satisfying as it demonstates the players ability to learn and master the many systems the game incorperates. Titan Souls meanwhile offers little satisfaction is this regard as it is incredibly mechanically simplistic; you can walk, roll dash, fire a single arrow and have to retrive it in order to attack again; the use of all this isn't hard to grasp, you'll have done so before encountering the first enemy. To get a solid grip on Dark Soul's mechanics might take the better part of hours of gameplay. That's where the fun lies. Titan Souls offers a challenge in a similar elk to DS, but in such a condensed manner that it can feel like a repetative slog, as opposed to a bountiful system of intricate trials.\n\nMeanwhile, for Shadow of the Colossus, the game does boil down to largely consisting of just sixteen bosses, but it's everything that truly makes the game; the sprawling map to explore, along with the visual feast of it's unique graphics style. But, back in Titan Souls, the world offers little in the way of exploration outside of the bosses, with the map serving as a overworld map, linking the individual boss rooms together. And as for the graphics (and yes, they do have a certain charm) are not too dissimilar to the art style of numerous other games; leaving the world, in part, uninteresting to explore and venture into.\n\nAs a final point, I know how little I've played, but I've given it a go and seen the game and personally, it's just not for me. It has taken cues from some fantastic games that I hold in high regard, taken their essence, stripped it back into something so simplistic and acute the fun was left out.","March 15","false","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However, I've come out of the game feeling more frusterated than like I completed a fun, hard challenge. The art design is pretty pleasing to the eye,  the controls are nice and tight, and the music is pretty good.\nTitan Souls is a glorified one hit KO boss rush dressed up as a retro Shadow of the Colossus without any real feelings of progression. There is nothing else to do besides slaying Titans, and that's a real shame. There were many opportunities to hide nice secrets in the overworld, but since what it does have (murals) adds nothing to the combat or the game in general, it ends up being more disappointing.\nLorewise, it feels like a mess. It tries to be as vague as possible, and when you do find murals depicting what could be lore, it is meaningless and doesn't add anything to the game. There was a large mural in the Forest area that no matter how I looked at it, it meant absolutely nothing. There was no context.\nAs I've stated before, the overworld is empty. SotC made up for the large overworld by adding upgrades to health and stamina, but since Titan Souls has no health mechanic whatsoever, and the bosses are one hit KOs anyway, there is no point to the overworld except as acting as a hub between the actual game. So the more time I spent on the overworld, the more I got bored of it.\nMost of the bosses operate on a "Think Fast!" attack system. Where the boss will attack at ludicrous speed without giving any tell worthwhile. The amount of times I started the boss fight, only to get killed a second afterwards because I had no clue where the boss was landing an attack is too much. The game gets most of the difficulty from this. And while some bosses have a rest in between a combo, the rest is not longer than 1-2 seconds long. So anticipating the direction of the boss to how long you need to pull the arrow back and avoiding death at the same time, creates even more frusteration. It gives off an RNG/luck feeling, as you can't determine what direction the boss is going to face for its rest period.\nHitting the weak spot does also not guarentee a victory, as it takes into account how much momentum the arrow is going and which direction it's facing. I've shot multiple bosses with a weak point facing towards the screen, but it didn't connect because I was coming in at an angle. The attack has to be precise, and frame perfect, or else you die.\nAnd die, you will. I spent 4 hours for myplaythrough, and died around 250 times. This is where I started feeling like I was playing something like Super Meat Boy, but not as fast paced when it comes to death and respawn.\nI am in the firm belief that most of my time spent in Titan Souls was watching the area fade to black as the boss continue to pound my body, and waiting for me to be able to control my character again to head all the way back to the boss arena. The forest area was the most annoying, because you had to keep scrolling through multiple screens before arriving at the bosses once again.\nThere is no real prgression outside of the gates you open, of which there are only two. The first one opens after the first 4 bosses are destroyed, and then the second after the the rest. So there was no seeming forward progression because of that. If the gates were used to continue on to other stages instead of dumping you into the hubworld and final area, there may have been a bigger sense of momentum, but even then, character progression doesn't exist.\nThe game is less forgiving than Dark Souls, and I believe that's a bad thing. The one hp is more annoying than it should be. If you make one mistake, have fun going back to the boss arena.\nTitan Souls sounds really good on paper, but because of the lack of other mechanics to give it more body, the game is too short for what it could've been, and too frustrating. Makes me want to play SotC even more though, so there's that I guess.\nTL;DR-It's a glorfied one hit KO boss rush with too much walking in the 'menu.'","March 15","false","5.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Another game that thinks Bulshit is Difficulty.\nLet me explain:\nEverything is a 1HKO. that itself isnt a bad thing, but\nThe game's Movement and Firing is like Castlevainia's: Solid, Fast Movement, but slow, clunky firing.

When you shoot it, It starts to move... AND NEVER STOPS.\nthat's this bosses main problem. When Paired with the Clunky Firing, you have a boss that's very hard to hit and moves fast, which is  problem when you need to send your arrow throgh fire to kill it. Fire that has to be activated by buttons. that only the brain can activate. A brain that NEVER STOPS. It can also Jump accorss the room and, if you remember, EVERYTHING is a 1HKO.

The lazer block is... a Block that shoots lazers from an Eye on one side. Every few flips, the lazer fires. In order to Kill it, I Assume you hit the Eye with the arrow. I say assume because this Boss is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Take the worst Aspects of the Ice brain Fight and Multiply them by ten, and you have the lazer Cube Fight. Not only does the Cube move so fast Sonic would say 'Wow, that's slightly faster then the Average person.", but, when the Lazer Fires, It you have a window of about 1 second to fire the arrow before your killed. and considering the clunky firing, you can guess how much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t it is.\n\nI could beat that boss if i Kept at it, but it wouldnt have been fun. and in the end, that's the worst thing a game can be.","February 4","false","0.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

If you're someone who is persistent, and likes to work for results, this game could be for you. If you care for mastering a specific mechanic, and game design expanding on one thing more so than adding new things, this game could be for you. And if you appreciate music, aesthetics and design, this game could be for you.\n\nTitan Souls is an open world game. Open world in the literal sense, the world is large, pretty, atmospheric, but empty. Most areas are serene, which is enjoyable, not intended for exciting gameplay. The point is to explore this world to find bosses or "Titans", and defeat at least seven of them. This is introduced well, as you have to beat four Titans before you can get to the open world, but there is no scale in difficulty. Every boss has unique and difficult to master patterns that can be exploited only after much practice. Some find bosses naturally easy to master, while others slave at them for hours.\n\nThis game is an adventure, it puts you, a character that dies pitifully after one hit, armed only with a single arrow, in a world full of collosal monsters. This is one of my main draws to this game. You do not grow mechanic wise as you play, there are no stats or buffs to your character, but you grow yourself as a player in mastering this game.\n\nNot many games can make an average playthrough span from ten minutes to three or four hours. It's artwork, honestly. I recommend it to anyone that can really appreciate it for what it is, and not for what it is not.","March 20","true","14.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But I am still recommending it. Keep in mind I haven't finished playing it yet.\n\nA game 90% boss fights and 10% walking around, one-hit kills, both for you and the bosses. This means the battles are extremely short. You start, die, maybe learn something, try again until you kill it. That is a compelling idea! But all this repetition is extremely tedious because you don't respawn fast and near the boss. And if we learned anything from Super MeatBoy is that repetition is ok if it doesn't waste my time. Dark souls sends you back too, sure, but the path is full of perils and challenges so you have something to do at least.\n\nSo this is where I find myself: I fought against a boss about 5 times, the boss itself is a compelling puzzle and a reflex challenge, and I WANT to try again. But every time the game sends me back I want to simply close the game. It's the walking from spawn position back to the boss that kills the pacing of the game because  it takes LONGER to walk over there than the fight itself.\n\nBut anyway. Yes, the game looks very pretty, the Titans are very well designed, figuring them out is fun, finally beating them is very rewarding. If you are a very, very patient person and are totally ok with the walking part (seriously, your thumb will gain muscle memory and you can do the path with your eyes closed) then you will love this game.\n\nOne final nitpick: why isn't run the standard state? who walks?

I was surprised at how fast I grew to dislike this game.\n\nThe mechanics of combat are basically redefined for each boss, and  you are expected via trial and error to figure them out. If you die you get sent to a respawn point which can be an agonizing slog back to the boss door.  The movement and polish are finnicky enough that you could spend a while pursuing the right solution, only to have it fail mysteriously and get stuck not knowing if you were close to the answer or not.\n\nBoss combat is like trying a bunch of keys to unlock a door that just sticks randomly sometimes, and if you get it wrong you have to walk around the house three times.\n\nThis is just a fundamentally broken design loop.  You can't have trial and error gameplay with punishment. It's basically the worst parts of every boss fight in every game distilled into one game.\n\nI would actually recommend the game to developers just so they can identify what this does wrong so they never do it in their own boss fights. The game may actually be more fun if you look at a FAQ which would remove the worst of the trial and error aspects of the game.","June 23, 2015","false","1.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MXsora/recommended/297130/","MXsora","MXsora","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MXsora/","283 products in account","The top reviews say it all.\nIt tries to be a combination of Dark Souls and Shadow of the Collosus except it failsat recreating the greatest traits of either. The atmosphere is nice and the music and art do their job well, but the lack of worldbuilding and motivation at the start makes it a drag to care about anything you're doing. There is absolutely nothing at the beginning, it just throws you in because you're playing a video game, now play the video game dammit, kill these things because they impede forward progress and literally nothing else. I got more out of the story from the breif description of the game on the store page then the time i spent with this game.\nIt lacks the scale and wonder of Shadow of the Colossus when it comes to the environments and exploration. It also lacks the intimidating nature and granduer of its boss fights as Titan Souls beleives in quantity over quality. The bosses are nothing more than a thirty second chaotic mess to see who hits who first instead of a puzzle that needed to be overcome.\nWhen it comes to difficulty, it looked at Dark Souls for maybe five seconds and decided that making everything tough as nails is the best way to make your game challenging and rewarding. In reality, it only frustrates the player as they spend more time walking back to the fight then actually engaged in it and once the player lands a lucky shot it is instantly over and you end up feeling nothing for beating the creature.\nIf the game focused more on a smaller number of fights that were longer and more challenging then just a one hit lucky strike and tried to do more with its story and world, then I'd be able to recommend Titan Souls. But, that's not what the game is, so I can't recommend it.","January 13","false","0.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

The reason that I don't recommend this game doesn't have to do with it being hard.\n\nI got this game because I love boss fights, so I figured it was right up my alley. I quickly found that the bosses in this game don't have the same feel of all of those boss fights that I love. You die in one hit, which I am quite okay with. However, most of the bosses also die in one hit if you manage to hit them at the right time, so it turns would could be very epic battles against titanic bosses into what feels like dumb luck and removes any sort of feeling of accomplishment when you do beat them.\n\nI remember fighting one of the bosses who had killed me two or three times and I was devising a strategy to avoid one of his stronger attacks that he uses throughout the fight. Except the next time I fought him I got off a lucky potshot after his first attack and killed him in one hit. It didn't feel rewarding, it just felt lucky, and honestly, I walked away from it feeling a little robbed.\n\nTo contrast this game with those of the Souls games and Shadow of the Colossus, both of which this game takes inspiration from, what this game really lacks is a sense of accomplishment for taking down the bosses/titans. In the other games I mentioned, the player, weak compared to these gargantuan creatures, manages to take them down against all odds. In Titan Souls, you don't get that. Because while the Titans may have different and more lethal attacks than you do, in reality they are just as weak as you are. And since most of their weak points are only momentarily visible, a lot of the time, at least in my case, it felt that it was just a lucky shot that ended most battles.\n","April 22","false","2.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You use this arrow to take down giant beasts, giving the game a Shadow of the Colossus feel. Controls are pretty good with a gamepad although i'd imagine it being very frustrating with just a keyboard due to directional control being integral to how you aim your arrows.\n\nThe game is pretty much a boss rush, and each enemy kills you in one hit (and likewise, you typically kill them in one as well). You can complete the game in quite a short amount of time, so I'd recommend waiting to purchase this until it's on sale, as a $15 price point is ridiculous for a game that may last some little more than two hours. Sure, you can redo the game on harder difficulties and go achievement hunting, but for the most part the rush that comes from figuring out how to kill a boss dies away after your first completion. Another complaint is that respawning takes a bit of time, which is a little annoying when you have to walk up to boss rooms and can get killed in a matter of seconds (at least 1/4 of my playtime was waiting for the screen to go black and returning to a boss encounter room). Along with this, while the bosses are on an epic scale, the one hit kills sort of work against the game in some cases. I've had random shots kill some bosses, which made the fights very anticlimactic. Since most bosses require precision, I didn't feel elated that I got a random shot, just like I cheated the game and didn't deserve the victory. Others may feel differently in such a situation.\n\nThe score is well done and the art conveys the boss characters well. Story wise there's not really much going on (from my playthrough anyway), although there are like murals on walls that I suppose are supposed to tell some sort of story if you pay enough attention to them?\n\nGet this game if you're looking for a challenging little boss-rush game to play through, but make sure to wait until it goes on sale. If you're looking for something with a strong story or a lot to do, look somewhere else.","February 14","true","4.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Bosses are unique and fun. Fast-paced, battles can be won or lost very quickly. Controller is recommended, but absolutely not required.\n\n\nThe game is entirely boss fights. These fights end in either one well-placed arrow against the boss, or one well-placed hit on you (with a couple exceptions). It can feel a bit underwhelming when you beat a boss because of this, but it's okay! There's a solution! It's called a whoooole library full of bosses. There's a damn lot of them, and they're all unique and hard to fight.\n\nThe game is played with minimal backstory (Did I say minimal? I meant it's not there.)\n\nControls are very tight, which is good, because the only way to beat the boss you're fighting might be to fire and arrow in between floating fists zooming around that can either block your arrow from their target or just pancake you.\n\nMusic is pretty 'aight\n\nBasic Controls:\nCan quickly move a short distance by rolling\nShoot an arrow, aim using controller or arrow keys\nCan use the force to make your arrow fly back to your hand, this can damage enemies and is sometimes the only way to beat them\n"AAAH! I'M SUPPOSED TO PLAY WITH A CONTROLLER!?" The game is meant to be played with a controller ("highly recommended") But certainly not required! With a controller, you can shoot your arrow in a whole 360 degrees around you. But if you're stuck with just the arrow keys, you can shoot in only 8 directions by holding down the arrow keys to aim ("^" Key to shoot North, ">" Key to shoot East, "^ and > together" to shoot diagonally NorthEast (This being said, you can also be insanely edgy and release the arrow just after letting go of one of your arrow keys after pointing diagonally "let go of "^" key after holding "^ and >", though this is generally unreliable and overall a bad idea)) Though it's harder to play with a keyboard, I beat the first 4 bosses in ~45 minutes, though those 45 minutes had sweat and lots and lots of blood poured into them.","December 10, 2015","true","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is a game where it's nearly impossible to feel bad while playing it. I found myself fighting and dying to the same boss over and over for about an hour and a half, and never once did it start feeling like work.

Unfortunately, a few note worthy flaws mean the execution leaves something to be desired.\n\nFirstly, despite being released on PC at the same time as PS4, it has clearly been designed for console, leaving the PC version feeling like a mediocre port.  It controls poorly without a gamepad, because the joystick (used for both movement and aiming) is replaced with the arrow keys, which means you can only really aim in 8 different directions.  This, of course, could have been solved with some modifications to include the mouse in the control scheme, but was not.\n\nAnother problem is the respawn times.  Yes.  I got it.  I died again.  I don't need to watch the screen fade to black as a behemoth continues to jump up and down on my bloody husk every ♥♥♥♥ing time, especially not if you're going to follow that up with making me walk all the way back to the boss room I just died in.\n\nEdit:  Got a steam controller and the game is very fun now.

For a boss-run style game (that has a total gameplay timer in it), short and sweet makes sense and turns the game into a speed running challenge if you're into that kind of thing, adding some replay value.\n\nGame is challenging, albeit not ridiculously so. As many reviews point out, it has a very similar feeling and theme to Shadow of the Colossus, but unfortunately lacks impact that made SotC work.\n\nPros;\n- I like that the game is short and mysterious, and doesn't waver from it's core concept\n- Challenging, but not over the top\n- Fast-paced\n- Has a hint of subtlety to it, enough to make it interesting and mysterious if you pay attention, not enough to make it stand out in the long run.\n- Soundtrack is pretty damn good\n- Art is really nice, reminds me of Risk of Rain\n- Final boss was pretty wicked, had a really cool final-fight feel to it.\n\nCons;\n- It is a short game, I enjoyed it as a short game but if you're looking for a time investment, this is probably not it\n- Puzzles and mystery of the game fall short. It seems like the devs were a small bit too careful about inclusion of such, exploration and discovery go unrewarded. While I found the one hint to the "Lost Woods" type area leading me to the boss, it would be easy to find said Titan without noticing such a hint, which is a bit discouraging and defeats the purpose.  Had they let the game have a greater element of discovery and perception to it, it would have made it much more interesting and rewarding to find more hidden Titans.\n- The actual fighting is unfortunately not thought through very well. There were several bosses were I was wondering "Oh, do I have to do 'x' to expose/hit a weak point?" when the answer was no, you just shove an arrow into the weak point and that's mostly it, which made it frustrating since I was otherthinking it and hoping perception would go rewarded, when it was punished with death until I just made a lucky shot and killed the boss.\n- For a mysterious game I don't want to say the ending was terrible, but it was. It kind of just ends, answering nothing and raising no intrigue. Had there even been a few really cool and artistic final shots of the area or the tower in the last scene I feel I would've been much more satisfied but instead it just kind of ends. I didn't even expect or really want answers, but it doesn't even present a story or end on more questions. Had the ending presented some kind of idea or introduced something that could let players develop their own story or outline of what the adventure was about, it would have had a solid and mysterious ending with enough intrigue to keep people talking and interested. Much like the end of SotC which I have to reference again, in the last scene your character is suddenly an infant with horns but the girl you were trying to save is alive again. It has a sense of closure, while also adding a layer of depth and confusion that raises intrigue. By contrast this game just ends completely and utterly, roll credits. (Yes, I got The Truth ending)\n\nThat pretty much sums it up. Took me around 2.5 hours first attempt. Fun and fast game with some healthy challenge that missed out on small opportunities to make it well-rounded and fully polished.","December 5, 2015","true","6.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you buy this game it is worth the money you spent however much. there is even new game +. in the end i rate this game 10/10 for amazing soundtrack, great controls, and beautiful scenery. ALSO: as a final note, the storyling is essentially up to the player to make up. the game doesnt guide you into a conclusion and that is another reason this game is special to me. i see a lot of people complaining that there is no comprehensive storyline and it makes me sad to see that they downrate this game solely due to that. the free roam capabilities are amazing!","January 1","true","11.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Unfortunately, a few note worthy flaws mean the execution leaves something to be desired.\n\nFirstly, despite being released on PC at the same time as PS4, it has clearly been designed for console, leaving the PC version feeling like a mediocre port.  It controls poorly without a gamepad, because the joystick (used for both movement and aiming) is replaced with the arrow keys, which means you can only really aim in 8 different directions.  This, of course, could have been solved with some modifications to include the mouse in the control scheme, but was not.\n\nAnother problem is the respawn times.  Yes.  I got it.  I died again.  I don't need to watch the screen fade to black as a behemoth continues to jump up and down on my bloody husk every ♥♥♥♥ing time, especially not if you're going to follow that up with making me walk all the way back to the boss room I just died in.\n\nEdit:  Got a steam controller and the game is very fun now.  Still only recommend if you have some sort of gamepad, but I felt I should note that it works very well if you do actually have one.","May 3, 2015","true","7.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VirtuallyReal/recommended/297130/","VirtuallyReal","VirtuallyReal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VirtuallyReal/","253 products in account","-- Recommended but on sale only --\n\nTitan Souls is a short and charming experience that would have been gold had it been a bit more rounded out than it was.\n\nWhile a lot of reviews downvote due to how short the game is, I'd consider it a "feature" of the game. For a boss-run style game (that has a total gameplay timer in it), short and sweet makes sense and turns the game into a speed running challenge if you're into that kind of thing, adding some replay value.\n\nGame is challenging, albeit not ridiculously so. As many reviews point out, it has a very similar feeling and theme to Shadow of the Colossus, but unfortunately lacks impact that made SotC work.\n\nPros;\n- I like that the game is short and mysterious, and doesn't waver from it's core concept\n- Challenging, but not over the top\n- Fast-paced\n- Has a hint of subtlety to it, enough to make it interesting and mysterious if you pay attention, not enough to make it stand out in the long run.\n- Soundtrack is pretty damn good\n- Art is really nice, reminds me of Risk of Rain\n- Final boss was pretty wicked, had a really cool final-fight feel to it.\n\nCons;\n- It is a short game, I enjoyed it as a short game but if you're looking for a time investment, this is probably not it\n- Puzzles and mystery of the game fall short. It seems like the devs were a small bit too careful about inclusion of such, exploration and discovery go unrewarded. While I found the one hint to the "Lost Woods" type area leading me to the boss, it would be easy to find said Titan without noticing such a hint, which is a bit discouraging and defeats the purpose.  Had they let the game have a greater element of discovery and perception to it, it would have made it much more interesting and rewarding to find more hidden Titans.\n- The actual fighting is unfortunately not thought through very well. There were several bosses were I was wondering "Oh, do I have to do 'x' to expose/hit a weak point?" when the answer was no, you just shove an arrow into the weak point and that's mostly it, which made it frustrating since I was otherthinking it and hoping perception would go rewarded, when it was punished with death until I just made a lucky shot and killed the boss.\n- For a mysterious game I don't want to say the ending was terrible, but it was. It kind of just ends, answering nothing and raising no intrigue. Had there even been a few really cool and artistic final shots of the area or the tower in the last scene I feel I would've been much more satisfied but instead it just kind of ends. I didn't even expect or really want answers, but it doesn't even present a story or end on more questions. Had the ending presented some kind of idea or introduced something that could let players develop their own story or outline of what the adventure was about, it would have had a solid and mysterious ending with enough intrigue to keep people talking and interested. Much like the end of SotC which I have to reference again, in the last scene your character is suddenly an infant with horns but the girl you were trying to save is alive again. It has a sense of closure, while also adding a layer of depth and confusion that raises intrigue. By contrast this game just ends completely and utterly, roll credits. (Yes, I got The Truth ending)\n\nThat pretty much sums it up. Took me around 2.5 hours first attempt. Fun and fast game with some healthy challenge that missed out on small opportunities to make it well-rounded and fully polished.","December 5, 2015","true","6.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I still have to kill a few more bosses in the game and that is the best thing about this game. I love the challenge in this game. But to the review!\n\nStory: You are a guy with a one bow and arrow versing bosses for some strange and unknown reason. I like that there is a simple concept to it. Not every game needs an enriching story so this is fine for me. However, since the world is pretty big, I would have liked to have seen some sort of lore to the world plastered on to the wall.\n\nGraphics: The pixel graphics look great. It has a good artstyle.\n\nSound: The sound design is beautiful. Some might say it is simplistic, but I think that works great for this game. The music makes you feel like you are at peace when you die after a boss. It makes the world you are in seem more mysterious. I'm glad that they chose this track or else I probably would have been rage quitting most of the time after the bosses kill me. Not every game needs to have a totally memorable track.\n\nGameplay: This is where the game truly shines. The bosses are hard as balls. At first the game starts you off with 4 pretty simple bosses. It is a one hit KO for each boss you face, but they also one hit KO you. ( You are more likely going to die first). The first few bosses set up what the game is going to be like. Each boss is some sort of puzzle that you need to figure out. Their weak spots aren't hidden, but are hard to get to. Most likely you will only have a split second to attack. Some might say this is terrible game design, but I don't think so. The thing is when you do hit the boss, I feel so empowered and ready to kill the next titan. I think the game rewards you for being good at the game. Each shot will take a lot of precision and skill, which is what makes this game so great.\n\nOverall, this game is great if you are looking for a challenge. The game is sort of like Shadow of Colossus with Dark Souls difficulty mixed in with Zelda puzzles to kill the bosses. The gameplay is challenging and also rewarding when you hit the mark. If you die, the soundtrack relaxes you and makes you come back for me. Put a great pixel art design and you have a done deal. Note: This game isn't for people who rage a lot.","January 1","true","4.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

First off, the controls are TERRIBLE, and there is no way to rebind keys in a game that came out in 2015! The controls could have been great: WASD to move, left mouse for arrow (use mouse to aim), and right mouse or space for roll. Instead, however, you use the arrow keys to move and X&C to shoot and roll, respectively. Who though this was a good idea? It's quite uncomfortable, and I often found myself pressing the wrong button, causing me to die. Because you die so often and so quickly, It would be nice if you spawned in front of the titan you last fought, to avoid the annoyance of running the same path to fight the same titan over and over.

The visuals are amazing, and the soundtrack is beautiful. It's like a 2D Shadow of the Colossus.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, you have to show an arrow into the enemy weak spot to kill him, but you can only do this when you aren't moving, and the titans can also kill you with one attack. I won't say the game is easy, mostly because of the one hit kill, but it's also not that hard. After you know how the titan behave is simple to know how to hit it's weak spot.\n\nOne point that i think the game lacks, is the absense of a story, and although it worked very well with Shadow of the Colossus, here it just makes you think that it's missing something. The game is also very short, and i don't find much of a replayabillity.\n\nI would say that 10€ would be a fair price for this game, mostly due to the fact you only need a couple of hours to finish it the first time. Still, i recommend it.","September 10, 2015","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

First off, the controls are TERRIBLE, and there is no way to rebind keys in a game that came out in 2015! The controls could have been great: WASD to move, left mouse for arrow (use mouse to aim), and right mouse or space for roll. Instead, however, you use the arrow keys to move and X&C to shoot and roll, respectively. Who though this was a good idea? It's quite uncomfortable, and I often found myself pressing the wrong button, causing me to die. Because you die so often and so quickly, It would be nice if you spawned in front of the titan you last fought, to avoid the annoyance of running the same path to fight the same titan over and over. I would recommend this game, but only of it's on a good sale and you have a controller.","February 12","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You use this arrow to take down giant beasts, giving the game a Shadow of the Colossus feel. Controls are pretty good with a gamepad although i'd imagine it being very frustrating with just a keyboard due to directional control being integral to how you aim your arrows.\n\nThe game is pretty much a boss rush, and each enemy kills you in one hit (and likewise, you typically kill them in one as well). You can complete the game in quite a short amount of time, so I'd recommend waiting to purchase this until it's on sale, as a $15 price point is ridiculous for a game that may last some little more than two hours. Sure, you can redo the game on harder difficulties and go achievement hunting, but for the most part the rush that comes from figuring out how to kill a boss dies away after your first completion. Another complaint is that respawning takes a bit of time, which is a little annoying when you have to walk up to boss rooms and can get killed in a matter of seconds (at least 1/4 of my playtime was waiting for the screen to go black and returning to a boss encounter room). Along with this, while the bosses are on an epic scale, the one hit kills sort of work against the game in some cases. I've had random shots kill some bosses, which made the fights very anticlimactic. Since most bosses require precision, I didn't feel elated that I got a random shot, just like I cheated the game and didn't deserve the victory. Others may feel differently in such a situation.\n\nThe score is well done and the art conveys the boss characters well. Story wise there's not really much going on (from my playthrough anyway), although there are like murals on walls that I suppose are supposed to tell some sort of story if you pay enough attention to them?\n\nGet this game if you're looking for a challenging little boss-rush game to play through, but make sure to wait until it goes on sale. If you're looking for something with a strong story or a lot to do, look somewhere else.","February 14","true","4.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In a sparce (but very pretty) setting there are a number of rooms each with a different boss in them. Each boss is at once a test of timing, aiming, and deduction as you try to figure out exactly how to kill it. You will die a lot, but each death brings you one stop closer to beating the boss, either through figuring out how you're meant to kill it, or getting the timing/aim just right.\n\nThis game is certainly not for everyone, it is only for people who get a sense of extreme satisfaction for overcoming very difficult challenges.

Although the game is fairly short, I enjoyed the game even though I finished it in barely 3 hours.\n\nPros:\n+ Great soundtrack.\n+ Good graphical style even though its pixel-based.\n+ General combat mechanic is pretty cool, almost every titan goes down with a single hit, but that goes for you as well.\n+ If you're struggling with a titan, you're not forced to beat it as you could just go somewhere else and start fighting another titan (Eventually you'll need to beat every titan in an area however, you can beat the titans in that area in any order you like).\n+ When you complete the game for the first time, you will unlock a couple of difficulty-increasing gamemodes, such as Hard mode, Iron mode (1 death = Permanent game over) and the No run/rolling mode.\n+ Some pretty hardcore achievements which definitely leaves a good challenge for those who wish to take them on.\n\nCons:\n- Game is pretty short, therefore I think the game should of had at least 10 more titans to be worth the full price.\n- The world is pretty small. At first it will seem huge, but the closer you get to the end you will start realizing how small the world really is.\n- Not really much of a story to the game.

Titan Souls falls short in many aspects, game length being one of those especially. It took me barely 2 hours to beat the initial game, and even with 3 extra modes added on, this is simply laughable for a 15$ game.\n\nSome could say that Titan Souls is "Inspired" by SotC, while I'd rather say that it's just a blatant 2-D ripoff with a much duller boss design. The fact that everything except for the final boss dies in one hit completely rules out the possibility of multiple form fight, which was amazing to look at in SotC, seeing how you were actually weakening the gargantuan enemies. In Titan Soul's it's just:\n\n-Look for a giant glowing spot.\n-Plink it with an arrow.\n-Dead.\n\nAbsolutely underwhelming gameplay.\n\nThe story, again, ripped off of SotC with minor changes which only make Titan Souls looks simplistic and evoke the classic "2deep4u" trope. The fact that the game is going for the "butchered indie retro" look only reinforces this, sadly.\n\nThe only redeeming quality was the soundtrack, which was unexpectedly great. I would absolutely listen to something like that in my spare time, especially the overworld music.\n\nAt the current price, I would strongly recommend against buying this game.

In fact, every boss can be killed in one hit to their weak point, but might take dozens of tries before you figure out how to do it.\n\nThat said, a few of the bosses require either ridiculously precise timing (like, less than a quarter of a second), and the final boss is entirely luck-based (the only "strategies" involve exploiting a weird quirk in his AI). The saving grace is that again, you only have to nail that timing once to kill the boss.\n\nInbetween bosses you'll explore some beautiful scenery. Every area has unique sights to see and was created with intricate detail; they vary from ruins to forests to a volcano and a frozen mountain. Your character's footsteps even vary depending on the ground you're walking (or running) on. Checkpoints give you clues as to the number and direction of nearby bosses.\n\nThere's also a phenomenal soundtrack, both in and out of battle; everry boss has its own song.\n\nThe one thing that I consider bad is the keyboard control. Most of the game can be beaten just fine with a keyboard, but there's a few bosses where it's much, much harder than a gamepad due to not being able to fire in any direction. When a boss's weak point is open for less than a second after an attack, 8 directions doesn't cut it.\n\nOverall, I highly recomend this game to anyone who likes killing creative and unique bosses. Which is hopefully everybody.","June 20, 2015","true","7.3"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

The one hit kills and one hit deaths make the game extremely tense at almost every battle, coming at it over and over, figuring out a way to win, it's an interesting learning curve but it can be intensely frustrating, especially towards the end. But that frustration is worth it in the end for that sheer sense of accomplishment.\nThe environment design is excellent, it might be a bit big and walking back to bosses can get a bit frustrating, but the way it's set out, some neat background details that help tell parts of the story, it genuinely feels like you're walking around a long forgotten world. The tidbits of story you pick up, especially when replaying after unlocking a certain mode, create an interesting "Fill in the gaps" kind of deal that, as I mentioned, reminds me of Dark souls.\nSoundtrack is also excellent. I especially like how the boss music can start at two different places so it doesn't get too stale for the short time you get to enjoy it.\n\nOverall, it's an atmospheric experience of a game that, if you like boss battles, is a must have.","June 13, 2015","true","5.5"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

I just finished the game in No Roll mode after a couple of hours of wanting to punch my monitor. I normally do these reviews after all the achievements, but I can only imagine it taking me a few more weeks before I can claim the Iron + Hard Mode achievement. I had to use a guide for some of the achievement kills, especially the glitched one on the gate keeper titan in the starting area. These achievements are brutal and not for the faint of heart. My Dark Souls days prepared me for this game, but it was still frustratingly difficult. If you're a masochist, you'll enjoy the added gamemodes.\n\nAs for the rest of the game, the mechanics are inspired by and almost identical to dark souls in which you roll and roll and roll and roll and maybe land a hit on the titan. The first time through will probably be difficult without help, but not so much you will never be able to continue. The graphics are your stereotypical 2D pixel art found in indie games, but I feel like they fit this game well. The art had a sort of charm to it but it wasn't anything new to me.\n\nI'll give this game 8/10 with a warning that you'll either love this game enough to finish it once, love this game enough to eventually hate yourself with the extra modes, or hate this game and wonder why masochists enjoy this type of thing.","June 24, 2015","true","23.7"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

As it is, it's more infuriatingly difficult than rewardingly. TL;DR: Recommended only for semi-sadists. This isn't as good as the games its inspired by (currently).\n\nYou have a run button, but you pretty much HAVE to hold it down, since the normal walk speed is a surefire way to get yourself killed.\nThe arrow is alright, but if you miss your shot, you're pretty much dead, since it takes too long to retrieve it.\nThe music is fantastic, but you'll only ever hear the first 6 seconds of a given song, because either you or the boss will be dead by then.\n\n\nNEEDED TWEAKS FOR GREATNESS\n* Double the speed of the arrow retrieval, at least in its acceleration curve.\n* Allow some movement (50% penalty?) while retrieving.\n* Make run speed 20% faster\n* Make walk speed 80% of what run speed is now\n* Eliminate tiny delay before your arrow shoots. A short press should still launch an arrow, not do nothing.\n* Arrow distance curve should increase. You have to hold the button a bit longer than feels right to get a 'usable' distance out of it.\n* Increase magnet radius for arrow retrieval. The archer has ONE JOB. Let's make it easy for him to do it.\n* Second-to-last boss needs to telegraph where he's going to go. It feels way too random and unpredictable. HIs window should also be about 250 ms wider, or it should be faster to nock/target the arrow. As it is, you just have to aim early and hope.\n* Swap blob boss and box boss as the box is a LOT easier and a better 'first' boss to encounter.\n\nOPTIONAL:\n* Add some degree of health, at least ONE hit of forgiveness, on the first playthrough. (though may not be as necessary if the tweaks above are applied).\n* Switch to a more standard "rule of threes" approach with yet more HPs to the player, like a permanent 3. We get to hear more music, and we get to have a more epic, less random chancey encounter.","June 28, 2015","true","6.0"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

This is the game you would get.\nWell, that was the idea, anyway.\nDon't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this game.  It was one of the few games I bought for full price and one of the fewer still that I have spent enough time on to beat.  And I enjoyed it almost every step of the way.  Almost.\n\nPros:  The graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is solid, the music and sounds and enjoyable, and the titans are full of variety and often have heart-pounding battles.  There's a fair amount of content and replayability, too (Although anyone who manages to beat the Iron Man mode is either a masochist or Lord Gaben himself).\n\nCons: It can get rather repetitive, and as the case may be, having to run to find the titan's lair and wait through loading screens every time you die can become too much of a hassle.  Also, although the titans are varied, 80% of them are just "roll and shoot until you hit the weak point."  The ones that didn't follow that pattern exactly were incredibly enjoyable and rewarding, and I wish there were more like.  I also wish there were more titans, honestly.  I don't entirely know if the game is worth it's $15 price tag, in all honesty, despite how much I enjoyed it.  One of my main problems was that, despite how large the world is, there isn't really much to do.  If you find every titan, from what I understand, there are no other secrets.  There are no monsters in between titans.  Just a lot of running and empty space.  Also, I do wish there was some sort of character progression.  I know that's the exact opposite of what the game is about, but hey, I like character progression.\n\nSo, all in all, it's a fun game for a few hours, and while I don't think I'd play it again (maybe in a couple of months I'll change my mind), I did enjoy the time I spent with it.  Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I had bought it on sale.\n\nTL;DR: TITANS ARE MY TRIGGER.","June 30, 2015","true","4.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

The gameplay is very similar to Shadow of the Colossus in that the only enemies you fight are boss like creatures that require you to find their weak spot and hit it with your arrow. Although you only need to hit their weak spot once, you also die in one hit, which is where most of the games difficulty comes from.\n\nThe Good:\nAs mentioned above, the art style is good and adds a nice atmosphere to the game with a great soundtrack that goes along with it, that includes peaceful music while exploring and looking for the bosses, and switches to a faster pace and more intense piece when fighting a boss. The controls feel fluid while running around and fighting, and only having one arrow to work with makes you have to plan when and how to use each shot. Since your arrow is also "soul linked" to you, it is possible to attract the arrow back to you after you shoot it, adding another element of strategy as you can hit the bosses by doing so. Each boss is unique and finding each of their weak spots is part of the challenge that makes fighting a new boss even more enjoyable. Managing to finally figure out how to defeat a boss and landing the precise shot to kill it is a very satifying experience. The difficulty of the game remains challenging but never becomes overly hard, and includes 3 new modes after you complete the story that increase the difficulty if you want more of a challenge.\n\nThe Bad:\nAlhtough the environments look nice, the overworld in the game is very empty, and the lack of a map can end up in you getting lost, but it isn't too difficult to find your way back. Although the controls feel fine, a gamepad is basically essential as there is no mouse aiming and only being able to aim in 8 directions with a keyboard severley increases the difficulty of the game, and in my opinion makes it almost unplayable. The biggest complaint I have with this game is that it is too short, being a $15 dollar game it took me only about 3 hours to complete the story. There is some replay value with the 3 new modes after you beat the story, but they still use the same bosses, which means you already know how to beat them.\n\nIf possible, I would recommend buying this in a sale if you want more value for your money, but overall I would say the fun boss fights combined with the appealing art and music outweigh the short length of the game. Each fight is epic in it's own way, making you use your wits to figure out how to find its weak spot, and your skill to land the perfect shot.","November 13, 2015","true","3.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The game is simple - kill the titans, absorb their souls. To be honest when I put it like that I'm not entirely sure we're not the bad guy in this narrative. The mechanics are equally simplistic, you have one arrow and Titans have one weak spot, find it, exploit it, kill it. The game is clearly inspired by Shadow Of The Colussus and in my opinion does an even better job of creating varied and interesting bosses. I found myself smiling often at this game's ingenuity, those satisfying moments when you figure out a Titan's achilles heel and the rush when you just know you're gonna' take it down next time. The pixel graphics are beautiful, there's a real sense of intelligent art design behind every environment and every Titan, it really feels like a passion project. Equal plaudits go to the soundtrack which is just exceptional, up there with Transistor as one of my favourites of the past 12 months. Normally after beating a game like this once I'll put it down and that's that but already I'm tempted to pick Titan Souls up again and try it with one of the gimmicky replay modes like No Roll or Iron Man. For those arguing there's not much to this game I'd argue there doesn't need to be, perhaps it's a quibble on price point but as a game I think it has everything it needs to.","September 14, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

You roam through the remnants of an ancient civilization and the lairs of gargantuan creatures, each of which you are required to kill. Why you have chosen to visit these lands and why these Titans need to be killed is never explained. While this may be seen as a weakness the lack of explanation has a beneficial effect on the atmosphere of the lands you roam through.\n\nTitan Souls is similar to Dark Souls in the sense that through deaths you will start to learn the boss pasterns and master the fights. There is one main difference, if you hit the Titan once with your arrow on the vulnerable spot it will die instantly. In similar fashion, you will die instantly if you get hit once by the Titan. To aid you in your task is a simple yet precise set of controls. As you only have a single arrow in your possession you need to make your shots count. Charging up the bow will make it fly faster and further. Once you have taken your shot you can run or dodge your way towards to arrow to pick it up or use your power to pull it back towards you (requires you to stand absolutely still though). This can get very hectic as the Titan will not sit around while you recover your arrow.\n\nIn the best moments, you will barely dodge your way past the Titans hands slamming on the ground, shooting your arrow at a perfect angle at the wall and using your power to draw the arrow back right into the Titans' back to finish it off. In the worst case scenario, you will get frustrated over a great number of deaths only to have a random shot kill the Titan and feel no sense of accomplishment at all. Futhermore, while most boss fights are original the level of difficulty can be both very high or very low for certain fights which makes for an uneven progression through the game.\n\nFinal score 9/10\n+Thrilling and challenging fights\n+Simple and precise controls\n+Pixel art\n\n-Can be frustrating; death comes quickly and often.\n-Sense of accomplishment can be diminished by finishing a fight through luck and not skill.\n-Spikes and dips in difficulty.\n-Somewhat short","September 4, 2015","true","5.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Beating a boss is one of the best feelings you'll ever have.","August 14, 2015","true","7.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

Still haven't replayed it through it's various modes though. Here are some thoughts on it:\n\nPros:\n- Great atmosphere: The soundtrack, retro landscapes and bosses all blend in togerther very nicely.\n- Challenging: The painful repetitive deaths force the player to be mindful and evaulate each boss encounter.\n- Replayability: The unlockable modes add a lot of replayability for those inclined to challenge themselves further.\n\nCons:\n- Too simple: Simplicity is good but in moderation. The only thing the player has to think about is boss strategy. There is no added layer of complexity outside of it. For example, the fire arrow mechanic used to access Onyxia's lair is a good idea but it isn't developed further. I could see the addition of other kinds of arrows, bows or even boots while maintaining the simple 1-hit-kill-or-die gameplay. By this, I do not mean adding an RPG-like inventory system but just the implementation of other small ideas which would make the game require more thought outside of the boss battles.\n- Small sense of achievement: The only reward a player gets throughout the game is the pleasure of overcoming the battles. Some kind of growth, character progression or cummulative reward system could help here. The steam achievement system helps to make up for it though.\n\nI'd give the game an overall 8/10.","January 22","true","5.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This and its general aesthetic are highly similar to the PS2 cult hit Shadow of the Colossus.\n\nHowever, unlike SotC, Titan Souls lacks any sort of content or progression beyond these boss fights -- both your character and all bosses (except one) die in one single hit, and your only weapon remains a magic bow with a single, returning arrow. Your only movement technique is rolling.\n\nThe challenge of the game is that only one specific spot on each boss is vulnerable to attack and only at certain times, and you have to figure out how to expose it. A single hit to that spot with your arrow -- including on the return -- will defeat the boss immediately (except one.)\n\nPros:\n- Widely varied bosses\n- Not every Titan is required to reach the "last boss", only the EX last boss\n- Game becomes gradually more frantic and difficult but not completely unfairly\n- Magic arrow returns on command and is deadly in transit; adds meta to some boss fights\n- Sectionalized content allows for both long or short play sessions\n- You defeat one boss by shooting him in the butt\n- Difficulty modes\n\nCons:\n- Keyboard controls ARE NOT WASD + MOUSE, so you're limited to shooting in 8 directions without a controller\n- Very short (my first run took a mere 4 hours 17 minutes)\n- Little to no content beyond boss fights and difficulty settings\n- Walking to bosses is a chore, especially between deaths\n- Certain cinematics are a bit lengthy\n- EX final boss is stupid and highly annoying; normal final boss is much cooler\n\n\n\nI would do the following to improve this game:\n\n- Allow use of WASD + Mouse for finer aiming (go ahead and fight Knight / Soul / Truth with only 8-direction aiming, see how well it goes...)\n\n- Allow players the option of either respawning at the boss room entrance or back at their last checkpoint\n\n- Allow players to teleport from one discovered checkpoint to another\n\n- Add a horse, chocobo ripoff, or other much faster transport that only works outside of boss rooms (animal will visually shy away from boss rooms it could fit into)\n\n- Add optional puzzle rooms or hidden non-Titan bosses that add context clues to piece the story together, none of which are required to access Truth\n\n- Add inconsequential wildlife such as birds or squirrels\n\n- Allow skipping of cutscenes or certain boss intros (--> Truth)","May 6","true","8.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's akin to Cave Story in that they're both good examples of short but otherwise worthwhile experiences. Allow me to explain step by step.\n\nLet's start with the Gameplay. We'll break it down between controls and mechanics.\n\nAs far as controls go, this game is very simple. You move your character with the arrow keys or control stick, you can shoot your solitary arrow if you have it stocked or call it back after shooting with the same button. While aiming to shoot, the arrow keys/control stick become your method of aiming instead of moving. Along with movement and arrow play, you also get a dodge button that can be held to make your character run. I highly recommend using a gamepad, some bosses are near-to-outright impossible with only 8 directions to move and shoot in.\n\nIn contrast to the simple controls, the gameplay mechanics are more in depth than one would expect. The entire game can be boiled down to a glorified boss rush. Every titan encounter is in the typical "boss room" structure, whereas upon finding the titan in its room and engaging in it only victory or death will allow you to leave. Every boss has a weak point, but is otherwise invincible unless you hit this one spot with your own arrow. This makes each boss feel more like a battle of wits rather than strength, where solving the question of 'what' the weak point is and 'how' to hit it is as important as not being hit yourself. Learning a titan's pattern through trial and error and finding the perfect moment to attack is what this game's combat is at its core. It’s best not to get too worked up as death will happen in this game, again and again and again.\n\nOutside of battles with the various titans of this world, the player is left to explore an unexplained and quite desolate world in search of the aforementioned titans. There are little rewards for exploration if you were looking for more than another titan to fight, and none if finding vague hints of the lore doesn't interest you. There are no mobs to find, and no enemies to deal with and level up against. This is a world of titans and decisive actions.\n\nNow let's talk about Narration. This topic covers story as well as the level of engagement the game is capable of putting you into.\n\nAs far as the story goes, you're a chosen hero on a mission to kill all the titans and obtain the ultimate power, and learn the truth. Although, none of this is told to you in the game. Going off just the game, and not the game's description on this store page, you're a guy (or girl...?) with an magic arrow searching for and killing titans to collect their souls. There are murals that vaguely depict events or prophecies, but nothing is exactly obvious. The designers seemed to have taken a page of From Software's book of 'finding the story' design, without actually putting much story to find though.\n\nDespite having such a paper thin plot, I found myself immersed during my gameplay all the way through. The engagement factor comes from the gameplay I mentioned before. Such an in-depth game of solving the boss' puzzle coupled with the sense of true satisfaction every time I figure it out and earn victory coaxed me into taking the next step and finding the next boss to fight. In some cases, yes I thought it impossible to defeat a boss, and ended up skipping it for another fight. Though that didn't deter me from playing nor detach me from the immersion, in fact it forced me to rethink how I approached the boss and lead to victory once I learned how to really fight each boss.\n\nNow we'll finish off with the Aesthetics. This'll cover the art, which includes both sound and visual, the setting of the game, and how everything ties together into one experience.\n\nTitan Souls uses a pixelated style mixed with simple three-dimensional graphics snuck in with a pixelated dress on to look more like all the other sprites in the party. Though it isn't 'anime with 3D CGI' levels of cringe worthy obviousness, in fact they're done quite well that I'm unsure whether the game was actually pixelated and not one big 3D graphic to begin with. The way some bosses can look like beautifully intricate sprites while others appear as pixel-textured models, and all of them fit without anything looking too far out of place is a feat on its own.\n\nSpeaking of fitting aesthetics, I found the music to be amazing in quality and purpose. The music is there to set a tone or invoke a feeling. With each area of the world came a theme that played the trope as straight as the typical lava area and snow area would in any adventure game, however that doesn’t mean to diminish how well it was produced. The feeling of first finding a new themed area coupled with the sudden shift in tone for the background music gave me a warm feeling of accomplishment, as if all that exploring actually wasn’t all for waste.\n\nDon’t even get me started on the boss themes. I absolutely adore the boss themes of this game. From what I could notice, every boss has its own theme. Some even move to their theme, at least in the beginning. Every theme came off as fitting for the titan at hand, and made that fight all the more memorable or even fear inducing when their theme would come in at the start of the fight.\n\nOn the topic of themes though, I found the settings of Titan Souls to play most of the usual tropes. You start in a simple temple area, than branch out into the forest, volcanic caves, snowy peak, and even a small graveyard, all linked back to the main temple and its own little gardens. The areas are large, giving the sense that you’re actually in a world and not some corridor leading to the next boss. That same size also plays into the general theme of the world. It’s empty. It almost feels dead, abandoned, apart from the titans you’re there to defeat. It gives an odd sense of wonder, like something else is going on. Your mission isn’t some fanfare’d prophecy about saving the world, there isn’t seem to be right or wrong here. Just titans, and you who have come to slay them for your own goals.\n\nAltogether, Titan Souls becomes an experience more than a walk from boss to boss. If you take the time to look around and get a sense of the world, and think about what’s going on, a whole story built on speculation opens up. The same book players would write for themselves when playing one of the notorious ‘Souls’ games by From Software, this game builds a world using only aesthetics and gameplay and doesn’t tell you anything at all outright. Each battle is a challenge on its own, forcing you to master the simple controls and the mechanics of the game alike as they’re presented to you within each fight. Death will happen, but it’s not the end. It’s only a means to grow and try again. Just you, your arrow, and a dozen titans to slay.","May 11, 2015","true","8.9"," 22 of 47 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","22","47","0","0"

I had to quit the game and start it up again because there is no option to just respawn at the last checkpoint.\n\nI played the first 4 bosses on keyboard, and I got so frustrated with the controls that I decided the 10 pounds for a gamepad was worth it, just to ease my frustration. DO NOT I repeat DO NOT play this game without a gamepad. You will rip your hair out.\n\nA few graphical issues and weird hitboxes made the game less fun at times, whether they were intended or not is not my concern, I got past them.\nBUT\nWhat this game did right\nGorgeous pixel art style, tastefully done to the point that you aren't thrown out of immersion. If you liked the art style of Shadow of the Colossus (I know that everybody makes this comparison but it is a valid one), imagine that but in stunning pixely goodness.\n\nBrilliantly composed sountrack, if you don't play the game at least take the time to listen to the OST. Trust me.\n\nThe fights are, in theory, simple. There is nothing difficult about this game IN THEORY. Enemies have a weak point. You have an arrow. Your entire body is your weak point. Hit their weak point before they hit you.\n\nSimple, right? But then you missed the first shot and there are 10 icicles dropping at your face and oh f*** your arrow is over there but you have to stand still to pull it to you a-\n\nDed.\n\nYou'll spend a life or two just sussing out the boss, finding its weak point, learning how it moves and attacks. Then you'll know EXACTLY how to beat him; God it's gonna be so easy this time DAMNIT I forgot about that other thing he does.\n\nDed.\n\nThere is a, not immediately apparent, underlying story to this game that (as much as I haven't finished the content yet) looks intriguing, made up, so far, of wall murals and  a secret boss who lets himself be killed because he can see the pain in your soul, stating "do what you need" as you draw your bow and fire directly into his eye. Wow.\n\nEvery boss feels unique, and I haven't had any feelings of a boss being "cheap",  Aside from greed amirite hahahahaha kill me  or a boss having any abilities that I felt were overpowered or "broken".\n\nThis game is hard because it is HARD. It is not hard because you get killed in one hit, that plays a part but it doesn't up the difficulty THAT much. This game has earned the reputation of being hard, because it requires you to be dextrous, have fast reactions, know when to use one of the game's mechanics instead of another, and even at some points to avoid attacking at a particular time because it could screw you over for the rest of the fight. This game requires skill, not luck, and certainly not just trying again and again and again until the stars align because the boss is TOO hard.\nTL;DR\nHard game. Buy gamepad. Fun to play. Music good. Some glitches. Art nice. Worth buy.\n\n\nOverall, this game is worth the price and then some, I'd fork out the money for the collector's edition because you get the OST and some digital art which is awesome when both are of such a high standard. Gameplay gets an 8/10,  soundtrack gets a 9/10 and art gets a 9/10.\n\n8/8 gr8 game m8s.","May 7, 2015","true","10.5"," 16 of 35 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","16","35","0","0"

Putting two functions (roll and run) on the same button makes it very difficult to survive bosses because I was constantly messing up, forgetting to keep holding down X because I just had to press it to roll. Also, why isn't running the default movement pattern? The world is too large to just stroll around in, because then you'll just get bored. Back to the controls, aiming is a b**ch since you can only use the arrow keys, which is incredibly inprecise. It'd be easier if there was real mouse support.\nSecondly, the map is confusing. Bosses are not easy to find beyond the first set of 4, and there are plenty of branching paths from the spawnpoints that lead you RIGHT BACK to the spawnpoint. If these paths don't lead anywhere, why are they here? Just to give an example, there are two bosses in the forest/swamp area. To reach the one to your right, you have to take the right path, then when you get to the next area, immediately turn back around. When you get back to the spawn area, it's no longer the spawn area and it leads you to the second boss. How is that sound design? And how was I supposed to know that? The game is already challenging enough with the bosses, making it harder and take longer to reach them (because it does those bosses are sooo far off) only takes away from the game.\nThe bosses are difficult, and if you can overlook controls and map and want a challenge then this is for you. If you don't like what I've written, don't buy the game.","May 2, 2015","false","1.4"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","11","25","0","1"

Avoid their attacks and your opportunity will reveal itself, though how and when to exploit it often remains unclear. Fortunately, you have infinite lives to try different tactics, because you will quickly burn through many of them. As unforgiving as this process is, I've rarely felt truly frustrated - I've simply not understood what needed to be done, or failed to execute it within the narrow window. You face a short walk back to the battle arena after defeat. I used this time to reflect on why I'd failed and how I could change my approach to succeed. Still, over time these treks become marathons, and an option to cut straight to the action would have avoided this. Controls are tight and responsive, provided you heed the strong recommendation of a game pad. Seriously, keyboard controls are futile here.\n\nThe world is pretty and detailed, yet feels slightly hollow - its a lonely journey. This was most likely to convey the isolation of your vulnerable protagonist, and this works, but some rewarding exploration would have created a more vibrant world, rather than just a hub leading to battles.\n\nThe score is glorious. Wistful, ethereal music accompanies the main world, ominously fading to silence once you enter a dungeon, replaced with pounding tribal beats and darting strings once battle initiates.\n\nWhen that perfectly aimed arrow connects and the giant is slain, it is satisfaction and disbelief combined. Only one task remains - retrieve your lone weapon.\n\nAn immensely rewarding game, it deserves to be valued on its own merit, not stand in the "Shadow" of any other.","May 23, 2015","true","8.1"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","9","21","0","0"

I'm playing Bloodborne right now so I knew going into this game was going to require a lot of reaction skill, and I ended up clearing the first 4 bosses no sweat (The Ice Cube was a b*tch until I learned the secret to the room!), and I'm sure by saying that karma is going to come back and absolutely obliterate me :D\n\nGetting real, I found a ton of things I love already: the soundtrack is gorgeous! It's a unique style I haven't heard in many games, but the boss music and the exploring music fits in perfectly (especially when you die the first time to the boss before the elevator!)\n\nThe pixel graphics I was surprised by. I know you can make art with pixels and make it look really good, but in Titan Souls the artwork done is fantastic! They really put their hearts into making this game look as good as it plays.\n\nGameplay is very simple, with only, like, three buttons needed, I would still take their advice on using a gamepad for this. You get used to it very quick and I started using the gamepad right away when I booted up, and it's been a smooth ride (except for one point where my arrow was stuck in it's draw phase and wouldn't get out of it until I died. Possible bug? Or perhaps my controller was being stupid :P)\n\nIf you were lazy and decided to skip to the final verdict of this insanely long review, just buy it. You won't have any doubts putting this game in your library, especially with it being on sale atm. Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of this, even if it's just for the soundtrack and artwork.\n\nAlso, it should probably be mentioned this game can make you laugh like hell!

But unlike with SOTC this game isnt boring and you feel like you actauly acomplished something when you killed one of the bosses.

I got this on discount, and its incredibly hard. Its essentially a well made pixel game where you fight 4 bosses. I've not hit the last boss but its incredibly challenging and makes you, most of all think.\n\nYour own weapons consist of just a arrow bow set, but the arrow returns with your call. Juggling this, that makes you stand still, becomes a challenge. Still, I very much do recommend it as a enthralling time killer. It makes you think yet sort of not? And I'm a -very- picky gamer.\n\nIn terms of the think yet not idea, you have to both use an active mind and instinct then reflect afterwards to see what tactic works. If you expect winning to fall in your lap, just don't buy it. Its something you have to work for. Half the time I was playing I was running in circles watching how the bosses move.\n\nEdit: I just looked at more content and I'm pretty sure there is a lot more content after the 4th boss that I didn't notice in a quick glance of the page.

But with the quite short time I had with this game, the finishing time didn't matter, it's the experience that matters. Seeing the boss for the first time and wondering what made it trigger, getting instantly squished, impaled, melted or vaporised (respectively), staying back to discover the attack pattern of the boss (while being assaulted with vines, fists, icicles, magical arrows of death etc,)  getting enough courage to take shots between attacks and finally taking it down. All of this was what makes this game great. Regarded, I still havent versed the majority of the bosses, but the ones I did fight were quite a challenge with the final fight making me physically gasp and then punch my fist in the air with joy when I finally took it down. I plan to go back to this game in the future.\n9/10","August 27, 2015","true","2.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

If you come expecting great graphics, music, and fun gameplay, you'll probably be pleased. It's a simple yet challenging game, that leaves you satisfied after each boss defeat.\n\nThe on criticism I would give is that I wish there was some type of RPG progression system, where you could upgrade some aspect of your character or weapon.

A good amount of them also, divided up into areas nicely\nReally satisfying to hit the boss at the right place after figuring out it's pattern and weakness\nCons\nRelatively short time to complete the game needed, as there are only bosses. There isn't a story, no NPC's, no dialogue, no progression or anything. So if you're "good at this" you'll be done quickly. (however, the game does throw replay challenges at you like an iron man run)\nYou only get one weapon - your bow. I think it would've been cooler if you had a few more weapons\nBosses literally need one hit to kill. Only at one boss you had to "expose it's weak spot" and then you could one-hit it.

This game is a love letter to Legend of Zelda and Shadow of the Collosus fans, as it combines the puzzle/strategy combat of the top-down Legend of Zelda games with the "you are puny" feel of Shadow of the Collosus. And, not only that, the bosses don't feel ripped out of either game. They are a solid combination of both games that gives most LoZ and SotC fans. Also, don't expect the story to be spoonfed to you. Seriously, don't. There is very little story to the game, partially to accompany the "OOH MYSTICAL" feel of the game, and partially because the devs were a little too lazy to implement story. Otherwise, it has rock solid LoZ gameplay with the hardcore SotC/Dark Souls feel, with an entrancing mood and setting of it's own.","December 21, 2015","true","7.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Now, I will say this game is rather light on content, but don't let that fool you into thinking this is a short game.  Beating it on the normal difficulty mode may take up to a few hours, but it's more to get you acquainted with the bosses you'll be dieing to in Hard mode.  See, this game is fashioned to be part Shadow of the Colossus, part Dark Souls, and (mostly) 2d.  So this means that hard mode is going to grind your face into the ground.  You can mix that in with Iron mode (One life) and prepare to rage harder than you ever have before in your life.  The soundtrack's appealing, and the gameplay is quite smooth.  I'd give this an 8/10 for the lack of content, but what IS there is polished and well made.

And instead of listing the typical pros and cons list, let me give you reasons to pick this up and reasons not to.\n\n\nReasons to buy:\nThe difficulty. This game is incredibly challenging while remaining enjoyable. While some may disagree, this game is unforgiving but not unfair. On my first run of the game, I managed to beat it in about three hours. In the process, I killed 18 Titans and died almost 200 times. Not once did I feel like the game was too difficult. Don't get me wrong, this game is hard. But still very enjoyable. And you have no idea the type of satisfaction you get when one boss has been handing you your ♥♥♥ for the past half hour and you finally manage to beat him.\nThe gameplay. Everything from the world to each individual boss fight felt unique and stylized. The game has character and that's something noteworthy. However, once you learn a Titan's attack patterns and weakness, most of them can be killed in ten seconds or less. You definitely won't be doing that on your first run though.\nThe soundtrack. God, the soundtrack is beautiful. It's the only thing I listen to on my iPod anymore. Worth the extra $5.\nThe artsyle. You can take a look at the screenshots and see for yourself. I can't get enough of it.\nThe controls. With a gamepad, this handles masterfully and smoothly.\nReasons not to buy:\nThe price. Once I beat the game once through on normal and again on hard, I found myself sitting at about 8 hours of playtime. Is that enough for $15 USD or your regional equivalent? Maybe. For me, yes. Definitely. I'm still getting massive enjoyment out of trying to speedrun hard mode.\nThe story. There isn't one. Except for the Maker's dialogue, but even then that hardly counts.\nThe controls. Without a gamepad, this game is god awful. Do not buy this unless you have a working 360 or PS4 controller. Spare yourself.\nThe mechanics. There is little progression in this game other than beat bosses to unlock more bosses. For people seeking that compelling RPG game with skill trees and talents, look elsewhere.\n\n\nThis game is geared towards a very specific type of person. I happen to be that type and I can wholeheartedly recommend this game. However, if you aren't that type, you'd be better off buying something else.\n\nIt's a shame that one of the devs is a child when it comes to criticism. I feel like some people are letting that poison their thoughts of the game, which is fair enough.\n\n\nTL;DR: This game might be for you, it might not be. Wow, whodathunkit.","May 10, 2015","true","9.8"," 11 of 26 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","11","26","0","0"

That is the crux of my own dislike of the game, a lot of bosses kill me too quickly to actually glean useful information from them. Experimenting with a different setup is possible, but sometimes you die immediately during an optimal setup and dismiss it only to realize you had it right the 4th time. The boss designs themselves are strong and when you finally figure out how to kill a boss quickly it's satisfying, the road there isn't enjoyable for myself though.\n\nThis isn't a slight on the design, there is extreme clarity in the choices they made in this game and it has a solid voice. I recommend it to other people who have patience and appreciate a well crafted experience.","May 18, 2015","true","3.1"," 11 of 26 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","11","26","0","0"

Should I not?" you may read that first line -and see the big blue thumb- and it may convince you to buy it.\n\nThis game won't be for everyone however. One of the main aspects of Titan Souls is that it is hard, it's very much like DarkSouls in its Difficulty, but I never found the game to be so hard that it would take me ages to beat a boss. I beat all the bosses mainly in under an hour -sometimes more or less- and only had to use a guide once or twice. The bosses are difficult to fight though, you have to give each boss your all and pay full attention or you will be squished, be it by a rolling yeti or a Mace Wielding Square.\n\nThis takes me on to something I like a lot about the game, its great boss design, almost all the bosses are very original and look terrifying to go up against.\nWhen I was in the fire world and had to fight that Mace Wielding Square I mentioned it made me panic like I had just met a giant face eating spider! It just started swinging its maces around and rolling after me literally seconds after the boss had activated. And when I was in the Ice World the Electric Snake Monster, when it sprung out the water, looked awesome and just took me well by surprise.\n\nI know there was some kind of argument or row between Total Biscuit and Acid Nerve who made the game, and Total Biscuit refused to review it (I don't know if anything has changed though...)\nAgain I don't for sure if there is but if there are any people out there, avid fans or Total Biscuit, who may see the news and take his side just because they like him as a YouTuber and not play it then you are missing out.\nEven if maybe Acid Nerve aren't nice people or maybe Total Biscuit  -For whatever reason- is right in the whole argument, it’s still a good by a game standpoint, so I still would deem it a must play even if the people behind it aren't the nicest.\n\nTo sum up,\nThe game is like if Darksouls and Shadow of the Colossus where put on a school assignment to make an indie game and then just combined Darksouls name and Titan Fall's name, and it all turned out really awesome.","May 24, 2015","true","10.1"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

Sounds harsh, and feels harsh, because the game genuinely plays extremely well, but there's not much to it.\n\nI haven't played much, and haven't gotten very far, so I can't claim that I know the story. From what I gather, you're a dude with a single arrow (which is admittedly a very strong arrow) tasked with taking down Titans and gathering their Souls, which I don't feel the title inferred well enough. Basically, you line up a shot, take it, and then can recall your arrow via some kind of psychic link. You must battle several bosses, and that's pretty much it. Each of the bosses has their own quirks, weaknesses, strengths, attacks, and designs, and it's always a nice 'daunting' feeling when you walk into a new boss room for the first time.\n\nIt's a good game, for sure. The design and art is absolutely fantastic, with a hint of retro-flair to it. Each boss has been wonderfully and maticulously crafted, and the work shows for sure. Titan Souls does a very good job of drawing you into its strange world, and the bosses feel as intimidating as their size would have you believe. It's challenging from the first boss onward, and only gets rougher from there. I've found that it's one of those games where you can switch off with your friends without anyone getting too bored from watching. Pretty damn good, best for fans of LoZ or Colossus, but I probably wouldn't buy it full price.","July 14, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

The only thing to do is walk around and fight the bosses.  Some bosses are super easy, some are very difficult and require almost pixel perfect timing.  You die in one hit, bosses die in one hit.\n\nControls are terrible.  Having run and roll on the same button (actually, on an XBOX controller you get three run/roll buttons and three shoot buttons) is stupid and/or lazy.  Graphics are not impressive.  Sound effects are not impressive.  Music is meh.\n\nBiggest issue is a game with one shot kill mechanics and lots of trial and error to fight the bosses is the huge delay between attempts.  A game like IWBTG, or something like Castle in the Darkness, you die, push button, respawn and go back to playing.  This game, you die, there's a few seconds of fade out, then a fade in, then watching youreself get up from the spawn, and then walking back to the boss room to try again.\n\nWhen you finally win a fight, you aren't even happy because it means you get to go walk for five minutes around a big empty world to find the next boss.  This game is somehow a more boring Shadow of the Colossus, with less story and less epic boss fights.  If you have trouble sleeping at night, this may be a game for you.","June 18, 2015","false","0.9"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I'm sure there are more bosses to beat as there are a few titans I wasn't able to find, but know exist from the glowing dots scattered throughout various checkpoints.)\n\nJust from that, I finished in about 2 hours in 180 deaths.\n\nFor a game that seemed to emphasize challenge with its 1-shot, 1-kill rule for both you and the boss, I expected it take longer to beat. To be fair, there were several bosses that gave me a hard time (the narrow timing on the arrow knight was particularly frustrating), but, honestly, most bosses go down within a few tries once you've seen the gimmick. The worst of this was the rolling eye encased in rock boss. Didn't even get to see his attack pattern - just waited in the bottom left corner and caught him in the eye after the initial dodge. A lot of fights go like that, and, while most fights felt satisfying, some felt like I just stomped the boss into the dirt and walked out the door laughing at the absurdity of it.\n\nFun, but a bit overrated. Seems to want to capture the feeling of pulling off a clutch, near death kill at the last second, but extends this to every fight and falls a bit short.\n\nI'd still recommend it, but maybe wait for a sale.","May 12, 2015","true","2.9"," 13 of 31 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","13","31","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZORBURGER/recommended/297130/","ZORBURGER","ZORBURGER","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZORBURGER/","141 products in account","This ♥♥♥♥ing game. I'm very conflicted on how to feel playing this game. I really want to love this game, and I feel like I would be obsessed with this game if it wasn't for some flaws that I have noticed throught my experience with the game. Let me point something out. I am no stranger to difficult games, I've completed this game on hard mode as well as beaten other hard games such as 1001 Spikes and Super Meat Boy. The difficulty of this game doesn't change my overall perception of Titan Souls. As stated I got some ♥♥♥♥ing beef with this game but I will share what I like about the game first.\n\nThe visuals is what brought me to this game in the first place. Just look at this game, looks like cheeky sex on the hood of a Mercedes Benz. Just while looking at my ♥♥♥♥ went into orbit from the sheer ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic arousal of stylistic qualities witnessed by eyes. And the ♥♥♥♥ing SHADING hnnng, the clean up was real. Alongside the pleasurable I liked the variety of areas to explore ranging from snow covered mountains, spooky gravyards, boiling caverns ect. The bosses also reflected the areas they represent which was also a nice touch. The bosses for the most part were fun each with a new mechanic ranging from pretty clever to annoying as ♥♥♥♥ but I'll get into that. The music was alright, not very rememberable but I enjoyed the calming sounds when exploring the overworld. All in all Titan Souls has a very good presentation but where does it fall short?\n\nWell here we go, It's time for what I didn't like about this flaming pile of ♥♥♥♥ that I would implore all the casual scrubs out there to take a ♥♥♥♥ing listen. Now don't do what I did and use a god damn controller ♥♥♥♥♥. Now I'm a lazy muther♥♥♥♥a and I don't like to dig out a controller to play a damn game on my PC otherwise just get this game on PS4 or some ♥♥♥♥. I beat this game on normal with the keyboard and let me just say this is not for the weak of heart. You will not have a good time and the ♥♥♥♥ing bosses will bend you over and ♥♥♥♥ your prolapsed ♥♥♥♥ over and over. So naturally you will be dieing alot. When you die to the boss you respawn to the center of the area you were in and have to walk back to the boss which takes about 10 seconds. Now you might thing that 10 seconds isn't even a lot of time to be mad about, but holy ♥♥♥♥ does that time add up. You die walk back to the boss, die in 5 seconds, walk back in 10 seconds, die again and walk back. Sometimes you spend more time walking back to the ♥♥♥♥ bosses then actually fighting them which is devious as ♥♥♥♥ and Acid Nerve gets a hearty "♥♥♥♥ you" from me, because WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ would anyone not want to spawn exactly the the boss that they were just fighting. OMG Acid Nerve like what were you guys on over there? This is by far the most wicked, uncool, unwanted, ♥♥♥♥ed up decision in your game. These bosses are going to kill you A LOT and it doesn't help when you need to run a good damn marathon to just get another chance of fighting. Some of these bosses are just ♥♥♥♥ and arn't fun, namely the final boss, no spoiler, what a bunch of bull ♥♥♥♥. That ♥♥♥♥ was not hard, it was just cheap and inconsistant and thier wasn't one moment that I and probably anyone else enjoyed fighting that ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nNow, in retrospective the game was actually pretty good which is why it just barely gets my thumb but good god is this a broken and bruised thumb. The game has it's flaws but you can't help but feel you accomplished something. While you were playing though you just wanted to ♥♥♥♥ing commit mass genocide on anyone who was involed and developing this steaming heep of ♥♥♥♥.

I'm only part way through at this point, but it is absolutely fantastic so far.\n\nSome people are complaining about it being repetetive on the fights? I don't know wtf they're talking about. Every boss is unique. Sure, they all have a weakpoint you have to hit, but the method of hitting it is very different for each boss. Learning their attack patterns (and trying to stay alive long enough TO learn them) makes each fight challenging and intense.\n\nAnother complaint I saw was the lack of story. Why do you need a giant narration or deep story for $15? Honestly, this has more story than some $60 games I've played... Finding the secrets and reading the boss names adds alot of flavor to the game.\n\nMY only complaint is that you can't change the keyboard controls. From watching videos, I kinda thought that shooting the arrow would be done with the mouse, but the videos were done with a controller. With the keyboard, you use the arrow keys and X and C, so aiming is only 8-directional and makes things quite a bit harder. But it's STILL fun with that limitation. Maybe even more fun if you like that kind of challenge.\n\nI honestly hope that there is either more added to the game over time or a sequel is made.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bitch-baby/recommended/297130/","bitch-baby","Silver Lining","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bitch-baby/","244 products in account","Addressing complaints of "long walks"Reviewers complaining about this game being a "return to boss simulator" have either only fought the 3 (out of 19) bosses that arguably have this problem, or have rediculously low attention spans. Most of the bosses in this game take less than 10 seconds to get back to. No, it isn't an instantaneous return to the boss, but is 10 seconds of walking really worth complaining about? In fact, the very last boss of the game (a secret boss, you can say) actually respawns you right back into the fight, and in my experience it makes the fight a bit too easy.\n\nThe fact that you have to walk to boss upen defeat makes every death count more than it would otherwise. Imagine if in dark souls, and this comparison has been made often, you were respawned at the boss's door when you died to the boss. That would eliminate the weight behind each death, and your fear of failing to retrieve your souls from the boss fight if you die before getting back there. The same concept applies to Titan Souls, the slight tedium (for lack of a better word) of walking back to the boss puts weight on your death, and makes the kill all the more satisfying.\n\nIs this game short? Yes, it takes a skilled gamer 3-5 hours to get through, maybe more if you have ♥♥♥♥ accuracy like me. So, yes, the addition of some walks to the game could have been to artificially lengthen the game, but it hardly matters as the game is still "short" in its final state.\n\nIn Conclusion: If the rumours of long walks between bosses are what are driving you away from the game, rest assured that its very very bearable throughout the gamen and always gives you enough checkpoints to use.\n\nIs it any good tho?Titan Souls is the kind of game that often elicits a love/hate reaction from players. This is beyond doubt a HARD game. It relishes in killing you in a myriad of ways, and the bosses gleefully stomp you to the ground even after you die. However, its difficulty is inherently different to something like Dark Souls, as its devoid of levels and complex combat and relies almost solely on accuracy and timing (the controls are tight enough to make this viable). The bosses are also not quite as "salt inducing" as those in the Souls games, as you don't lose too much upon death and can always take a break from the boss and try another.\n\nThis being said, its also a very well designed game. Boss mechanics are often varied although most are quite straightforward. The final few bosses of the game in particular are quite well designed and offer a nice up in difficulty. The NG+ offers even more complex bosses, as many of them change up their mechanics when in NG+. The game also offers many "challenges" in the form of the achievements, that can turn an easy intro level boss into a formidable enemy.\n\nConclusion: Try the demo first to see if it resonates with you. Highly recommended on sale; keep in mind that there is only about 3-5hrs of base content. Controller highly recommended.","May 2","true","6.5"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CaspianCrawdad/recommended/297130/","CaspianCrawdad","CaspianCrawdad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CaspianCrawdad/","281 products in account","Titan Souls is a top down non-linear puzzle game, similar to the idea of Shadow of the Colossus.  While not on the same level with the comparisons between the two, the one thing that both games have going for it is the boss mechanics.  Titan Souls takes that idea and turns it into a mechanic that the bosses die in one hit, you die in one hit, and you only have one arrow.  A puzzle like mechanic that is lacking the usage of equipment and abilities.  Instead, it's based on reaction time and awareness.  If you miss your shot, you'll probably die.  If you never learn the boss's mechanics, you'll die.  You can argue that a game based on trial and error is not a good game, but trial and error is a concept in every game.  The fact that the Souls titles (which need to stop being compared to Titan Souls) are very succesful because of the trial and error.\n\nNow to play this game, you will need a controller.  The PC controls are not fantastic in the least and there are no key rebindings (although there are only two real actions in the game).  If you don't have a controller, you'd either go and get one or just skip it.  The difficulty is an opinion.  I say that because people who can solve puzzles or learn mechanics quickly, will have no problem.  If you can't, you're going to get stuck.  The art style is fantastic with a portrayal of some Fez like animations and the camera being drawn back reminds me so much of what Below on the Xbox One is doing, giving you a sense of how large this world is.\n\nThe music is simply beautiful in every aspect, to the point that it's a damn shame they don't have it on sell anywhere.  From soft and somber music to some straight heavy guitar riffs, the range of sounds are absolutely outstanding.  As far as sound design, every sound is impactful (I.E. a yeti rolling into a wall, a blob hitting the ground, being sucked in by a gust of wind, etc).\n\nThe story itself is probably the weakest.  It heavily focuses on narrative and doesn't give you much of the history of the world, bosses, and protagonist.  That is up to you to decide whether your character is there for the right reasons or the wrong reasons.  Why is he here?  What kind of person is he?  Why do the titans not attack you instantly?  What's the "truth"?  All questions you ask yourself throughout the game, only for you to come up with the answers.\n\nI feel the price range of $15 is fair because I love simple yet challenging games like this.  It's not everyone's cup of tea, but if you dig like Shadow of the Colossus and are heavily supportive of the rise of indie devs, I totally suggest picking this title up.","April 15, 2015","true","32.9"," 9 of 24 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","9","24","0","0"

If seeing a good 2-hour movie is worth 10 bucks, then playing a great game for at least triple that time is definately worth 15. The game is exactly as good as it looked in the trailer, if not better. If you thought the trailer looked awesome, don't worry, the game delivers. I strongly recommend this game. The gameplay is solid and simple, yet immensly difficult at times which is great. The game world is beautiful and mysterious, like something out of a dream. Just as strongly as I recommend this game, I also recommend a controller beacause keyboard controls are pretty brutal. People have been complaining about the keyboard difficulty, when the game literally says "Gamepad strongly recommended" whenever you boot it up. It's basically saying "you seriously need to use a controller but hey, its a free country."

I'm probably just salty, but I lost count of how many times I'd aimed in the direction of the boss but just barely missed. You come to slay a number of Titans for some reason I... never quite gathered, I probably missed something. One boss asks if you're after 'power or knowledge', but that's the only clue I can remember. The game feels like a mixture of old school Zelda and Shadow of the Colossus, with a greater extent towards the latter; a young hero travels to a forbidden land with a cursed weapon, seeking to slay a number of immense creatures and obtain their power. In spite of the similarities, Titan Souls does more than enough to set itself apart.\n\nThe bosses are nicely varied, each being highly challenging and needing a VERY lengthy period of trial and error to overcome. Each of them have a weak spot for you to hit with your arrow, and the challenge lies in exploiting that nanosecond of opportunity to hit it.\n\nThe game itself is INFURIATING, and not just from the fact that you die in one hit and the bosses' attacks are fairly quick; you'll quickly feel apathetic towards your character when he doesn't hit the weak spot that, in that brief moment, would have been an easy hit, or when he dies because he doesn't move faster than a brisk stroll while the boss is stomping after him. But then, if you die, it's your fault, and while I could argue that the game might set the bar a bit too high at times, or that some of the boss kills require a degree of luck, that's probably just me being salty at my 100+ deaths.\n\nNow, people have issues with the fact that this game has no progression, and is nothing but boss fights, and while I LOVE boss fights (hence my Steam name) I can understand their issue. Shadow of the Colossus succeeded with having 100% boss fights by having those lengthy moments of traveling from the hub temple to the Colossus' lair, and having you do them in a specific order, one at a time. Colossus had progression, while Titan Souls simply has 'Beat four bosses, then beat the rest of the bosses in any order you want before the last three.' But I'd argue it has a sort of Talos Principle vibe where, after a period of making no progress you say "Okay, I'm gonna try another one and come back to this one later." But, to each his own. I thought this game layout worked for my tastes, but I respect that it didn't for others.\n\nAll in all, while this game nearly made me put my fist through several walls, it left me with that feeling of "SCREW YOU" each time I killed a particularly tough boss, and each death made me clench my teeth and refuse to concede defeat.\n\nPros:\nNice art style\nGreat music\nVaried, interesting bosses\nSimple gameplay\n\nCons:\nEXTREMELY difficult\nCharacter's slow movement and lack of accuracy with a bow can be frustrating\nFaster movement speed in the overworld would have been nice\nAnticlimactic ending","April 23, 2015","true","7.2"," 27 of 63 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","27","63","0","0"

The controls are what they're supposed to be, smooth and efficient. The game isn't really difficult, it feels a bit more like a Dark Souls series or Bloodborne in which when you die you know it's your fault. The Art direction and the music are amazing but the story and the world feels maybe a bit too simplistic. I just unlocked some modificators for the main game (hard mode, single life mode (outch), no roll mode (outch too)) that will extends the really short game length.\n\nAll in all, Titan Souls is a great concept that will please the people looking for a quick and fun challenge or the speedrunners.

I dont really know what to say apart from go buy it and play it. It is one of my favourite games EVER and I think it definately is worth how much money your charged for it. The boss battles feel so well designed and each battle is a unique experience and whenever i finally conquer a boss you just feel an overwhelming about of satisfaction and joy. The only thing i would critisise the game over is the fact that when I die (and youll probably die a lot) the walk back to the boss is very annoying, escpecially if you just cant find a way to defeat the boss in the first few tries and sometimes the boss fights become very tedious if I struggle for too long but that addind to the satisfation of finally killing it when I do. I love the art style and the split-second descisions really make you have to think fast, which I can see why people may dislike this game about. Another complaint i see is the controls. I think it's just a matter of finding the right pattern and finding a perfect movement around it, and really just to practise. I definataly think this game is worth picking up.","May 3, 2015","true","8.9"," 7 of 21 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","7","21","0","0"

(but when they warn that a controller is strongly recommended, they aren't kidding, I haven't tried with a keyboard and mouse but aiming the one arrow you have would be near impossible with only 8 cardinal directions.)\n\nTL:DR: get this game, it's fantastic, cheap and a great way to kill an evening or two.","May 2, 2015","true","0.6"," 6 of 19 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","6","19","0","0"

The games name was Titan Souls and started of as a game jam project, started from three guys named Mark Foster, David Fenn and Andrew Gleeson.\n\nThe basic gameplay is that you are a Titan hunter and are on the mission to kill all titans you can find and absorb their souls. Your weapon of choice is bow and arrow. One arrow to be exactly because this one arrow can be shot and pulled back to your player via telekinesis.\n\nOn your way to become the next legendary Titan slayer you face up to 17 Titans and the final boss, which is the Titan Soul itself. There are 6 parts of the world where different elements of Titans are waiting for you. Heat or Lava types vs ice types, normal types and venomous types.\n\nEach Titan can be killed with one hit to their weakspot, the problem is, that either this weakspot is hidden behind cover that you have to break or you have to act really fast to get a shot at it.\n\nThe gameplay is a big challenge and sometimes really annoying as you have to run a few seconds to get from your savepoint to Titan that you’re trying to fight. These few seconds are not that much alone, but if you fail multiple times again and again, you’re really annoyed that some Titans are that far away from your savepoint. I’d love to see a improvement so you are respawning right at the door to the Titan again.\n\nThe graphics of this game is a fantastic 2D world mixed with some 3D elements from time to time. The world is filled with small details like small piles of snow, that you can roll through, a dead Titan lying on the corner of the map and overall the style of the game has a reminiscing touch from FEZ, which I really liked.\n\nThe soundtrack is really awesome and in fact I’m listening to it right now as I’m writing this review. Each area has it’s own music and every Titan again too. The thing is that you will probably not hear much of the Titan music, as you are first, concentrating on not dieing and shooting your arrow in the right moment, second you probably die or kill so fast, that you won’t have a chance to listen to the soundtrack until the end. But don’t worry, if you bought the game, you can find the music and all sounds in the games directive as .ogg file.\n\nIn fact, you could mod this game easily with photoshop and a sound programm to exchange some data, but that’s a different story.\n\nFor you out there, who really want a challenging and simple game, Titan Souls is your first choice if you’re not that much against using a gamepad on PC. The game is just designed for a controller because you need the accuracy of a joystick to target with the right angle on screen.\n\n[SPOILER WARNING]\n\nBut there’s also a hidden 19th enemy, called the truth, which has a slightly different challenge for you. You can beat him in three different steps, because he is changing is form in 3 variations. The thing is, that once you got to know the pattern or system behind the movement, you can do the first two steps without a problem. The third step again is a real challenge and considering the fact that three steps of random events like chasing eyeballs might be too hard to manage, it is probably for the better.\n\nAfter you beat the game you get a nice screen presented which tells you how many Titans you slaughtered and how many times they did. My playtime of my first full run was about 4 hours and 20 minutes, with over 200 deaths.\n\nThe game presents you also the possibilty of 4 savegames to start different runs with different modifications such as Hard mode, Iron mode, Truth mode and No Roll, which means no rolls OR running.\n\nTo be honest, the first normal run was difficult and stressful enough for me, so I have not played the game on harder modes yet. I can only guess that these modes really stress you out and I think that the gamedesign for your player might be too difficult at that point.\n\n[END SPOILER WARNING]\n\nSo this game is a big challenge and if you are the type of person that likes to struggle and seek for the one perfect shot-moment, you’re definitely the type of gamer that should check out Titan Souls.\n\nMy biggest problem is, that there’s no real point of doing all this. You’re just the kid running around and absorbing souls. You will only get a small hint of a lore, but that’s all about it. To me, this game is more arcarde style, which is not bad, but could have been a little bit more.\n\nSo my final thought on Titan souls is, that it’s the perfect small game to test your skills and nerves, but if you are looking for something with real depth, there’s not much to it except for the beautiful graphics and music.\n\nBut you can download a Demo on Steam, so go and find out for yourself if this game is worth your money or not.","May 2, 2015","true","5.3"," 10 of 28 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","10","28","0","0"

One bow, one arrow and one hit. You defeat Titans and continue on to your quest. What is the quest? Well to defeat Titans and that's about it. The story isn't all that complicated and it doesn't really need to be but there are several areas with cave drawings and such so I presume there is a reason or a hidden message behind the game.\n\nThe game as you've probably seen above uses pixel graphics and personally I quite like it. It's good pixel art with a lot of vibrant colours and shading. The only problem I had was the main character. He/she looked a bit derpy to be quite frank. But all in all it's good.\n\nThe game doesn't have any small time enemies, loot, gear, easter eggs or a lot of what we've come to expect. It's all about the Titans which some people refer to as "Bosses" but since they're the only enemies in the game it's hard to justify that term. The bosses usually take one hit or have some armor you have to remove and I like it for the most part. It's cool defeating them but I it sometimes get's fustrating so you might want to take breaks when playing. Not that you probably need one since this is the game's biggest problem.\n\nIt's too short.\n\nThat's a bit of a shame. I liked this game but I think they may have stripped too much away from it. I know I may have missed some Titans but I didn't just run straight through the whole game. I died, I dawdled around corners to see if there was anything worth seeing but yeah the game was a bit short. However I believe this is a game that is meant to be replayed a lot on various modes and beating your score. If that's your thing then I think you'll have a better time and if not make sure you take this into consideration.\n\nThe music I just have to mention. It's really danm fine stuff. A lot of soft melodies as well as tough brutal chords but you die so quickly you barely have enough time to hear it.\n\nThis review wasn't supposed to be so long but I can't do too much about that. It's a good game with a cool simple idea and combat with unique "bosses" and excellent music. It's short however and multiple playthroughs seems to be expected with multiple modes. I give this a 7/10.","April 25, 2015","true","3.9"," 12 of 33 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","12","33","0","0"

But all that to the side Titan Souls is a solid adventure game with great music, atmospheric map design, and crushingly difficult boss fights. The game has a very simple mechanic where you die from one hit, however so are all the bosses. The boss fights feel more like a puzzle than fight, its just that these puzzles need to be solved with precision and timing. Sadly the game isn't very long but I can say it is more about quality gameplay than anything else. As far as story goes I can't seem to find one, you are an archer with one arrow you have to reuse all the time and your fighting titans because feel like it. If there is more to this story I certainly can't see it but it doesn't give me any bad feelings towards it.

Like a solid 10x better.)\n\nAnd here's the long version:\n\nI bought this game because I saw a video of it on YouTube and I thought it was a beautiful nod to Shadow of the Collossus while still being original and creative.\n\nI went into the community discussions to see if there were any tips on beating the Skull-With-Spike-Balls Titan, and I saw tons of drama and criticism for the developer.  The same is reflected in the reviews.\n\n\n\nThis game is infuriatingly difficult, cruel, brutal, unforgiving, and downright evil.  I love it.  Every time one of the Titans kills me, it makes me want to beat them that much more.  Every time they kill me I get a new idea on how to beat them.  and that's what this type of game should be - unforgiving but fun.  It's much the same reason I enjoy Risk of Rain or Dungeon of the Endless.  Yes, I am putting this gem right up there with those.  It's fun and brutal and every second of walking through the beautiful landscape is awesome.  The music is spot-on, and I enjoy 90% of the Titan songs.\n\nMy biggest complaint is caused by my own lack of skill in this game - when I die to a Titan, I don't get to listen to the soundtrack any more.\n\nMy second biggest complaint is that I have yet to find a way to listen to the Titans' songs after I kill them.\n\n\nI don't know the developer, and I don't know what all the drama is about, but you don't have to agree with someone to appreciate something they've made.  It doesn't matter if Van Gogh was an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or a saint - people still appreciate and love his work.  The same applies to game developers, musicians, whatever.\n\nStop giving this FUN GAME bad reviews because you disagree with something someone said: you don't have to like a developer to like his game, in much the same way that you don't have to like an author to like his books (Orson Scott Card is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but he's a brilliant author).","April 21, 2015","true","26.6"," 15 of 41 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","15","41","0","0"

With amazing art and a beautiful soundtrack, this game is worth the cost. But what is Titan Souls? Titan Souls is a Judum Dare style game with the theme of 1 hit, 1 kill. This goes both way for you and the bosses. While dying in one hit sound troubling, the save points are generally nearby and are only a short walk away to try again. People have attacked this game mainly for the amount of walking you have to do, but for god's sake its an open world game. Of course your gonna do some walking. Also, the reason they dont respawn you at the entrance is for the fact that if you struggle against Boss A, just go to Boss B instead and try killing him. Whether it be shooting a Yeti in the butt, or having to shoot an armour clad skeleton in his arrow, then his body within the short frame of three second, this game is meant to be challenging. Yes the story lacks, but you can clearly put the pieces together if you explore and read the names of the bosses.  The longetivty of the game is questionable at times, with the option of Iron Man mode, No Rolling Mode or just Hard mode, it can get very boring very quickly.     The cost should not sway you from buying it, it is well worth the 15, with possible hints to DLC in the future. So go out there, find a boss and solve him/her out. Whether it takes 1,2,5 or even 100 attempts to kill that boss, the victory is quite worth it.      Overall, the only cons of this game would be questionable longetivity and difficult story line to understand.","April 21, 2015","true","7.6"," 23 of 59 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","23","59","0","0"

A 2d game similar to Dark Souls / Zelda, home to a little boy hero equipped with only a single arrow to vanquish his enemies. When I started playing, I loved it from beginning to end, the art style, the one shot boss kills, the beautiful scenery that was devoid of life. The whole game was wonderful, I would reccomend it. That being said, I beat the game in five hours and after that I played a little bit on ng+. Aside from the bosses being a bit harder, and being able to read the names of them, I didn't see much of a change so I just put it down and went to bed. I personally NEED some dlc for this game, or i'm afraid I wont be playing it for some time, new bosses and maybe a twist to add a skill or two to the game.

You play as a little kid, you have a bow and only one arrow. This arrow is indestructible, so even if you miss your shot you can pick it up again or even summon it back to your location, but while you’re summoning it you can’t move, which makes you vulnerable to enemy attacks. In terms of movement you can dodge by pressing a button and if you hold down that same button you can run. And honestly, that’s pretty much it in terms of controls. One button to shoot and retrieve the arrow, another one to roll and run. Besides moving with your analog stick, this is a two button game, extremely simple. But don’t let that simplicity trick you, because the ways this game uses its mechanics are extremely varied, you’ll be using your skills in many different ways. Every boss you fight is extremely unique. Every one of them has different attack patterns for you to memorize and different weak points for you to explore. Some bosses die in a single attack to that weak point, but that one attack is usually pretty hard to land and requires precise timing and positioning. Other bosses have certain protections that you must first get through in order to strike its weak spot. And although all the bosses die with one well placed attack to its weak spot, you also die in a single hit. There are no health bars or anything of the sort, and because your enemies are so  varied, prepare to die a lot while you learn the different strategies.\n\nI’d say this game is definitely worth at least two playthroughs for a casual gamer, since you unlock Hard Mode after you complete it and you'll have a tough time figuring out the story with a single playthrough, but for those that really love it, no doubt you can spend some time with this game. My first playthrough took about 3 hours, but this value might vary. If you kill all the bosses on your first try it’ll be a lot shorter for sure, but I wouldn’t count on that.\n\nMy complaints with this game are very minor. I don’t really like some of the pixelated textures in the world, and I usually don't have an issue with Pixel Art games. Another complaint that I have is that I think the game could just spawn you at the boss room entrance when you die. Running back to the boss from the checkpoint seems unnecessary. It’s not a huge run, but if you a die a lot, it becomes frustrating, and I think it would be a simple change. I would also like to know the story or at least some justification for why I’m killing Titans, what’s my motivation. Maybe that will all become apparent when I figure it all out, but it’s the same complaint I have with the Dark Souls games. I don’t like this style of storytelling. I like my stories to be up in my face, or at least give some establishment, give me some context, don’t put all of that behind locked doors and send me out to find the key. But that’s obviously a very personal opinion, lots of people seem to enjoy that style of storytelling.\n\nSo who’s this game for? This is for gamers who enjoy a challenge. If you’re able to die repeatedly and face death not as a defeat but as a process that’s teaching you what you need to know in order to defeat your enemies, than you and this game are gonna get along just fine. If on the other hand you get easily frustrated when you can’t figure out how a fight’s supposed to work or become demotivated because you can’t defeat a boss, than maybe this isn’t the game for you.\n\nBut yeah, that’s pretty much it. I find this game to be very challenging and also very rewarding. It’s like every time you face a new encounter not only do you feel extremely satisfied when you finally kill the boss, you also feel satisfied when you find its weak spot and how you could potentially kill it. I absolutely love this game, it has Magical Noob’s seal of approval, great job guys!","April 21, 2015","true","8.6"," 14 of 40 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","14","40","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daytondoes/recommended/297130/","daytondoes","Dayton Does ¯\_( ͡°Ꮂ ͡°)_/¯","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daytondoes/","1247 products in account","Titan Souls is an amalgamation of everything awesome that has surfaced recently in video games, as well as all the pieces that made the classics what they are. Lines are often drawn to Legend of Zelda. With a bow, and one heart that doesn’t BEEPBEEP at you endlessly. It’s not an entirely inaccurate comparison, the bosses are larger than life and the music is heavenly. It’s epic during fights and can also turn relaxing and subtle while you wander the overworld. While the humongous titans can smash you in less than an instant, their own demise can be as quick with the correct strategy. This borderline of victory and death and the ability to leap right back in and correct your past mistakes is an extremely addicting combination. Will Titan Souls stand the test of time? Or will blemishes end up bringing it to its knees? Without any further adieu, lets dive into Titan Souls.\n\nThis game works so well simply because I look forward to making my way to the next boss and picking apart its weakness. Most bosses will take a bit of trial and error, and even once you have them figured out, one slip can lead to a trip back to the save point. The run back usually isn’t too long, but between boss hubs there is a massive overworld. It seems almost too large for its own good. Puzzles are sparse and don’t take much thinking to conquer, especially after the intensity of a boss battle. Aside from it being pretty vacant, it is pretty enjoyable with many changes of scenery and lovely mood music to relax you after a string of hectic failures against the titans. The variety of bosses you will find in this game is pretty vast as well; from a frozen-brain, to a yeti, to a giant mushroom. The feeling the game creates when you first step into a room and lay eyes on a new titan is ecstasy. Even if you die seconds later.\n\nEach boss even has its own way of moving. One particular boss comes to mind that submerges itself in the water, only to leap into the air and crush the platforms that you stand upon. Some patterns are more coherent than others. The massive amount of experimentation makes this game a pleasure to play, and when you finally achieve victory the elation is well deserved. I do wish there was a bit more lore or story to explore, since the vast world makes you thirst to know more but doesn’t really do much to satiate that desire. This is where it really falls short in my eyes. For a game to deserve a comparison to something like Legend of Zelda it really needs to offer more depth.\n\nOverall I think Titan Souls will remain a game that stays in my memory for a long time to come. While it has a couple of problems, such as the somewhat uninspired design behind the boss rooms and the slightly monotonous feeling of the overworld. However, the boss fights will keep you engaged and there is even a new game plus for when you think your journey is finally concluded. I’d venture to say that the game really only begins with new game+. The replayability is there, and Titan Souls is fun enough to keep you endlessly engaged. The fact that I want to see more of the lore behind the bosses might be a complaint, but it’s also a testament to the game’s ability to completely absorb you. Great work by Devolver Digital as always! Hope to see more from you guys soon.\n\nGameplay:\n\nControls- 8/10\nFun Factor- 9/10\nDifficulty- 7/10\nReplayability- 7/10\nInnovation- 8/10\n\nAesthetic:\n\nGraphics- 9/10\nMusic- 8/10\nSound FX- 7/10\nStory/Lore- 5/10\nLevel Design- 2/10\n\nFinal Score: 70/100 for fun factor, graphics, and controls.\n\nSummary: A string of epic boss battles with a beautiful retro aesthetic.

It is extreemely anticlimactic when the boss can be beaten in 10 seconds or less, as long as you do it perfectly.\n\nThe game just isn't as satisfying as it should be. If more of the bosses had multiple stages this could be fixed, but the developers seem to have focused more on making it difficult to survive for even a few seconds, instead of making it difficult to last the whole way through.\n\nI will also say that i haven't beaten the game yet (though I am almost certain that the boss I am failing to beat right now is the final one), so it seems that the game is rather short as well, but you should probably look for another review written after this one to make sure.","April 14, 2015","true","3.8"," 27 of 71 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","27","71","0","0"

Beating it seems impossible at first, but once you figure out where the bosses' weak spots are, and begin to understand the timings, patterns and are able to appropriately gauge the level of risk you start to see the genius behind the game's design philosophy.\n\nIt's not about rushing and repeating each boss again and again until you finally make that lucky kill (although this does sometimes work). It's about taking the time to observe and study the creatures, and then plan ahead your movements in order to make that single satisfying kill.\n\nThere's no inventory, no loot, no progression, no fluff. Instead, there is just your own level of skill, which you will see gradually improve after each and every death (which is almost always your own fault). There is a certain purity of design distilled into each of the 18 bosses and that's what I love the most about this game. Granted it's short, but it's very sweet.\n\nNew Game+ seems impossible for me to beat right now - but I suspect like the main game I'll eventually be able to figure it out and there will be another moment in the near future where I'll just "get it".\n\nWhat a brilliantly crafted experience, well played Acid Nerve!","April 14, 2015","true","13.1"," 161 of 374 people (43%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","43","161","374","7","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/internisus/recommended/297130/","internisus","internisus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/internisus/","2421 products in account","As a boss rush game, what distinguishes Titan Souls is that it is a one-hit boss rush game—for both you and the bosses.  The encounters play out like puzzles; impressively hefty three-dimensional creatures dominate their arenas as they throw their weight around, often leading you to scramble and panic before you've figured out how to manage them, and you will die many times in your effort to learn how to fight and defeat each of these well-patterned foes.\n\nAnd you must learn, for there is nothing save your own skill and strategy that can help you.  This elegant design refreshingly eschews the bloat that is prevalent among modern games; you will find no fodder enemies, equipment upgrades, or level ups here.  Some reviewers have opined that Titan Souls therefore lacks "progression"; that, somehow, more game is an insufficient reward for overcoming a challenge.  These people secretly hate video games.\n\nDespite its simple concept, it would be unfair to portray Titan Souls as merely a series of boss rooms.  There is a world here stretched between them, beautifully laid out and lushly drawn and animated so as to provide a sense of place which meaningfully contextualizes your experience of searching out the slumbering titans in their secluded dens.  It is a world with secrets, too.  Several titans have hidden themselves well, and during your hunt you may stumble across routes which are obscured by the game's overhead perspective (speedrunners take note).\n\nFor those who pay close enough attention, murals carved into the walls of cave passages tell a subtle story together with environmental detail and even the locations of the titans themselves—a story that cannot be fully grasped until a second playthrough after receiving the true ending, which translates enemy descriptions.  Even before you have that information, however, there are still some surprising titan encounters with thematic implications—enough to plant that seed of familiar dread in your stomach and start you wondering whether this quest you are on is a noble one at all.\n\nCompleting the game for the first time and getting the true ending took me about 3 hours, and I spent 8 more refining my speedrun.  Beyond that, there are additional modes for a harder new game+ difficulty, a one-life iron man run, and a restriction on rolling and running that requires you to completely change your tactics and gain an even better understanding of these boss fights.  For those who are willing to patiently replay Titan Souls and master its myriad challenges on the game's own terms, I certainly do recommend it.\n\nIf you decide to make the purchase, consider paying a little extra for the deluxe edition as the soundtrack is quite lovely and easily worth the additional cost.  Sometimes the guitar and flute pieces that play as I walk through the forests and among the ruins remind me of Child of Light; they share that wistful melancholy.  Try Forest Songs for a sample.","April 17, 2015","true","11.9"," 78 of 189 people (41%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","41","78","189","6","2"

There are 19 bosses in total, and beating the game unlocks three alternate modes to play on. Everything I said from early impressions stands for the length of the game. I've heard that Hard Mode makes some notable changes, but haven't tried it out just yet. Will update when I can confirm. I died around 250 times on normal, which I think is the most any game besides VVVVVV has killed me.\n\n--------------------------\n\nSo far I've seen a little under half of the games bosses and killed a little under a third of them. Based on how horribly the fights in between "killed" and "seen" went, I don't expect I'm anywhere near a third of how long it'll take to beat.\n\nThe easiest way to recommend this game is to tell you to go play the demo. If you like that, you're going to love the full game. If you didn't, you're not. This is a game that takes the deliberate combat of Dark Souls, the boss philosophy of Shadow of the Colossus, and the art and music of Legend of Zelda and combines them into something truly unique. The demo contains three bosses from the game, and although they're the three least interesting I've fought, it's still similar enough to the full game that you should know whether or not it's your thing.\n\nIf playing the demo is for some reason not an option, the best way to describe this game is a series of very unique and *very* skill-based boss fights. You get one infinitely reusable arrow. You die in one hit. The bosses die in one hit to their weak spot. Combat is essentially a real-time puzzle in which you're racing to identify and hit that spot before you make a slight mistake and die. It's a game where you'll routinely win by pixels and milliseconds, and also one in which you will much more routinely lose by pixels and milliseconds. If you find defeating the odds makes up for the frustration along the way, I cannot recommend this game more. If dying a dozen times in a row to the same boss doesn't sound fun, you will absolutely hate it. For those worried about the lack of exploration in the demo, the game world is much, much larger and there are plenty of side areas to explore. After the initial hallway, even the required bosses can take a decent amount of exploration to find.\n\nArtistically, the game looks and sounds phenomenal. The boss design takes heavy inspiration from A Link to the Past and  The Wind Waker, with Shadow of the Colossus and some other Zelda games mixed in less noticeable ways. The music shares similar inspirations, but stands easily on its own.\n\nFor anyone considering the collectors edition, I would say it's worth the extra $5. The soundtrack is great, as I've mentioned, and the art book is equally impressive. Unless more are hiding from me somewhere, however, there are only two wallpapers included. They're both great, so I'm not mad about it, but I'd certainly have liked more than the minimum needed to use a plural.\n\nI'll update this if anything significant changes as I play through the game, but I can't imagine it will. This is a game for people who love precision, classic Zelda boss fights, and beating the odds. So far, it does those things better than any of its inspirations, and even if the length isn't quite there in the end, that's worth $15 to me.","April 14, 2015","true","5.1"," 50 of 127 people (39%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","39","50","127","2","0"

After my first playthrough of the game, I can tell you that getting that final titan kill was one of the most exhilarating feelings I've ever experienced. Just working out the patterns and  mechanics of each battle is engaging enough, but the ultimate reward and satisfaction of finally taking down the beast you've been dissecting for the last half an hour is a feeling like nothing else. I'm sure you know by now if Titan Souls is your type of game or not: challenging, analytical, and precise. It is not for everyone; this game weeds out the impotent and incompetent. But, if you're a masochist with an eye for reconnoitering, I promise you will enjoy every little bit  of this game.","April 15, 2015","true","11.7"," 82 of 200 people (41%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","41","82","200","4","0"

Like, super duper pleased with this, this is really high on my 2015 list so far. My time with this game is far from over, but I'm loving it so far.\n\nHowever, this game will not be for everybody. If you're patient, appreciate 1 thing done right as opposed to a lot of things done 'okay', and like the idea of getting ever more efficient at fights, then all aboard the hype train.\n\nTitan Souls is what you get when you boil down Shadow of the Colossus to the raw and add in a lot of cute sprite art, with a soundtrack that honestly rivals that of SotC (seriously that forest theme is so fetch).\n\nThe difference is though, that this game is a one-shot-kill for everyone involved. Even though it has 'Souls' in its name and shares the same welcoming of multiple deaths, the combat is very much distilled down. In Dark Souls, you'll often trade blows and dance around, whereas here, it is more of a waiting game to figure out where the weak spot is, prime yourself for that key shot, and claim souls. It's more like Nidhogg, or Bushido Blade for the Playstation, in that way.\n\nThis means that once you've figured out how to beat a boss, fights can last merely seconds, and while some my think that's not great from a £/min perspective, I personally feel so pumped when something that's been giving me so much trouble for so long crumbles so quickly. Also, upon beating the game, more game modes are unlocked to add to the replayability, and to make the experience a lot harder.\n\nThere's no other equipment in the game. It's just you, your bow and your arrow. The are tight enough to pull this off, and there's never a point when you die that you fell like you can blame it on janky controls. They're fine, you just need to git gud.\n\nHowever, this does lead on to my only negative, but it's not one I can really fault it for. Having more 'Zelda-style' puzzles in the overworld would have really taken this game over the top, but that's not what the game set out to do. This is a game about killing big scary things, and so I can't really fault it for not being something that it isn't trying to be.\n\nSo, to summarise:\n\n+ Gameplay\n+ Music (unnnff)\n+ Visuals\n+ Atmosphere\n+ End-game unlocks\n\n- Not enough puzzles, but oh well.\n\nThis game is pretty great.","April 17, 2015","true","15.0"," 24 of 69 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","24","69","0","0"

Firstly, I'd like to emphasise that looking at the profiles of those people who have not recommended the game they have not completed the game (one of the achievements) and are therefore writing from a biased perspective. A perspective influenced by their lack of skill and inability to overcome the challenges thrown at them in this game, to then blame it on poor game mechanics (Yes I'm looking at you Wolfman...amateur).\n\nNow that's out of the way let me explain the good points about this game:\n\n1) The Graphics - This retro pixel-style game design is amazing and is pleasing to look at whilst running around and during fights.\n2) Sound & Music - The sound and music tie in well to the area and/or boss that you are fighting to make for a better experience. I bought the collectors edition myself and the soundtrack is something that I would listen back to in the future only to be hit by a freight train of nostalgia and want to put myself back into this torturous realm!\n3) Gameplay - This is debatable amongst the player-base (so it seems). However, the difficulty of the game, even in normal mode, provides a challenging experience for even the best of gamers out there. That split second window of opportunity you have to hit a shot, to then succeed and fist pump the air is truly gratifying. If you are not a skilled gamer to start with then this game probably isn't for you.\n\nMoving on to the negative aspects of the game:\n\n...there aren't really any major problems in my eyes except for one; respawn distance from some bosses. There are platforms in the various regions of the world which act as checkpoints and a place to respawn should you die during a boss fight (which you will). The distance between these checkpoints and the entrances to the various bosses can sometimes take up to 30 seconds of game time to run between. Dying multiple times and then having to run and waste more time adds to the frustration factor of the game.\n\nAnother potential negative about the game is the lack of story. It seems to be non existent but there are puzzles and lore which have yet to be discussed or discovered due to the age of the game. I find myself sitting in a room with three directions on the floor wondering what exactly it means and if there are secrets to the game that I have yet to find.\n\nThe only other points to mention in this review are to critique some points from players who have not recommended the game.\n\nSome people have stated that there is 'no reward or growth in order to overcome bosses' that you are having difficulty with. THE WHOLE POINT OF THE GAME IS TO FIND A WAY TO OVERCOME IT YOURSELF. IF YOU ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO DO IT THEN YOU'RE A SCRUB.\n\nThe game mechanics have been criticised too with people stating that the inability to move when charging a shot with your bow or recalling the arrow is an out-dated mechanic or broken. NO. The game is designed like that to make it challenging. Having played through and completed the game on Normal and Hard mode I can safely say that if I had the ability to charge my shot whilst moving the game would be a joke and far far too easy.\n\nTo sum up, I didn't purchase this game for a story or to find excuses. I purchased this game to challenge myself, to be rewarded with a massive sense of achievement once I was able to overcome the various challenges I was faced with. I plan to replay the game on No Roll Mode (which I am currently doing) and to try and get most of the achievements (albeit Iron Mode - 1 life to complete the game will be near impossible). Anyway I recommend this game, yes it is punishing and if you aren't good enough you just aren't good enough. As with all things in life, you either train to become better and overcome the challenges or you just fail. If you can't overcome a challenge in a video game I dread to think what your actual life must be like. I believe there are hidden secrets yet to be found and I look forward to replaying the game and torturing myself some more!","April 15, 2015","true","22.1"," 45 of 117 people (38%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","38","45","117","5","0"

If you're not a big fan of this style, then wait for it to go on sale. It's not for everyone, but it's an excellent example of the genre.\n\nTitan Souls is a clever & beautiful pixel action adventure game. Think Zelda, Isaac, and Hammerwatch, but boss fights only. Each boss has its own weakness that you have to figure out which adds a slight puzzle element. Titan Souls is not overly difficult -- yes it's tough, but I've played harder (i.e. Eron, Contra, Megaman). What may bother people is having to do the same thing over and over until they get it right. This may feel repetitive. Some people will hate this aspect, others will enjoy reaching perfection.\n\nTitan Souls is well balanced with a decent learning progression. It's a great example of the genres it fits in. It's got beautiful pixel art, great soundtrack that fits well, and excellent mechanics. This style of game though is not for everyone. At $15 USD if it's not in one of your favorite genres there's a good chance you may not thoroughly enjoy it. In that case, I'd say wait for it to go on sale a bit. For me, I very much enjoy this style game and it's absolutely worth the current price point.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HqHhN3w6I0","April 16, 2015","true","0.8"," 58 of 148 people (39%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","39","58","148","4","0"

This game was designed to be a PS4 game that just happened to be released on PC as well.\n\nShort and Sweet: If you like speedrunning games, buy this. If you are expecting an AAA title legend of shadow souls love child, you will be highly dissapointed. Buy if you feel that 5 hours is worth 15$ to you, (lot better price than the movies, too.)\n\nForwarning: This is less a review about the game, as it's just simply amazing that three guys pulled this off without a high budget anyway, and more about how I feel about people reviewing this game with poor or biased judgement.\n\nThis game is just amazing for anyone who loves to speedrun games. (Heck, it's even got a built-in timer.) The designs are just simple, but complex enough to give a good first experience, and give you the possibility of beating each boss in 10 seconds once you learn how. Most people came in here expecting a huge, zelda-esq game where they would constantly be fighting bosses. This is not a huge game. This is a short game, made by THREE people. THREE. It was DESIGNED to be short, for the purposes of being able to play this game over and over and over again, not for the sake of a new experience, but because each time you find a faster way, a better way, a way no one ever thought of. Taking 20 minutes to beat a boss the first time, to take 5 minutes, the next time, to taking only 10 seconds to beat him after that just feels amazing to me.\n\nI feel people have this warped idea of what a game should be. This is NOT a AAA title, yet people seem to be holding this game to those standards. The soundtrack is pretty good, considering this is a game with only three developers with probably an extremely low budget. Yes, the game is short. Yes, the game has some control issues. Yes, the game's bosses can be completed within 10 seconds each. Yes, the game has no puzzles that make you think about what you have to do. You know what? They wern't even trying to make it, yet you have a warped up idea that all games should hold up to this standard.\n\nThe game is around 19 bosses, each taking anywhere from 5 seconds to 30 seconds to complete once you figure out their patters, and you'll more than likely be completely done with the game in 4 hours and then never touch it again. It was by far worth the 20$ I payed for the digital collectors edittion. (Bought it so I would have a map for drawing my speedrun routes, I like the sound track, and the art is good.) This is not your average AAA game, it's a game that has recieved so much love from people who like the game for what it is, it flooded in people who are expecting more than the short experiences I love. Transistor is another fine example of a short, rememberable game like this one. They both are around the 15$ range, and both last around 4 hours of gameplay. So it is "worth the 15$," but you guys just don't like the game. If it isn't for you, it's not the game's fault you don't like it, so no need to give it a bad review.\n\nI respect people who rate the game negative for having issues that are apart of the game design, and not gameplay. If you don't have a controller, it sucks. They even say when you play, "gamepad highly recommended." I can understand giving it a negative review for that, because the game just wasn't designed for a keyboard. They could add mouse support, rightclick a location to move that direction / roll/run. Left click to shoot/draw arrow. I understand that. But giving it a bad review because the game isn't an adventure game, or it doesn't have secret powerups for you, isn't the games fault, you just came in with improper expectations.","April 16, 2015","true","6.0"," 98 of 240 people (41%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","41","98","240","3","2"

But this game is magnificently crafted, scored and stylized. Each boss fight feels unique and all the fights are boss fights. While the game is light on story, it is set in a colorful and imaginitive world that is brutally contrast to the intensity of the fights you'll have to face to reach the end.\n\nOn the point of the fights: each titan is unique and challenging in its own way, employing different tactics and abilities to force you to think about your approach.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this game.

A lot. If you don't like being challenged, steer clear. Otherwise stay seated, because you're in for a fun game.\n\nYour unspeaking character faces nothing but challenges in a beautiful, but lonely world. The only creatures you encounter are bigger and stronger than you. There are no upgrades, your only reward is being able to move forward. I liken the themes prevalent in Titan Souls to Stoicism; all you have is yourself, your wits and your ability to endure increasing hardship with neither complaint nor reward. Oh, you also have a magic bow and arrow, too.\n\nI personally am struggling through the middle of the game, but improving myself to overcome merciless bosses is a rewarding experience. The fun is in getting better. I highly recommend Titan Souls to those who like to overcome challenges.\n\nAlso, this game is beautiful.

The 2d/3d blend of the bosses made it stand out from the dreaded "2d pixel indie game". The soundtrack does it all from adding to the serenity of the hub world, to intensifying the boss fights, although for the harder bosses it'll take a few attempts to actaully get past the first few seconds of the music. The soundtrack is the reason I would recommend getting the collector's edition; you won't be dissapointed.\n\nThe game is not long at all and could easily be completed in less than 2 hours on a first play through, so if you are in the mood for a +100 hour game this may not be what you want right now.  However, it was refreshing to play a game that didn't try to eat up hours of your life. The game isn't overwhelemed by an obscure lore that must be found, complex mechanics that must be learned, or any sort of trends that have become so common. There are bosses, environements, and you trying to kill said bosses with your arrow.\n\nAnyone can pick up this game, and everyone should. The gaming community could use a break from all other time-consuming games.\n\ntl;dr\n80s Zelda had a baby with Shadow of the Colossus and this is said baby.

The reason behind this is because I beat this game in just under two hours. I feel like this point should be made front and center, as it is a very huge factor in determining whether or nor you are going to purchase this game. Even after defeating all the bosses, as well as the secret final boss, this game took my friend around three and a half hours. Since we completed the game first time through at roughly the same pace, I'd imagine it would take me roughly the same amount of time. There are additional difficulties, such as a Hard Mode (makes bosses kinda harder maybe), Ironman mode and a mode where you can't roll. Suffice to say, if you're one of those people who only likes playing a game once, you may wanna steer clear of this game until a sale.\n\nNow, let's stop gabbing on about the length of the game and talk about what the game has to offer. Whether or not the second word of this game's title being "Souls" was an allusion to the series of a similar moniker is unknown to me, but despite this, it's much better to compare this game to Shadow of the Colossus, as much like Shadow of the Colossus, this game is "Boss Rush: The game." There's a bunch of bosses that you have to fight (around 19 as I was last informed), you run around a map roughly half the size of the overworld in Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, solve a couple of puzzles on the overworld, and that's about it. Unfortunately, the overworld for this game never gave me the same sense of wonder and adventure that SotC gave me. While this is subjective, of course, the overworld looks empty and desolate in a kinda bland way.\n\nCombat is two buttons: push A to roll (also, I'll be assuming you are gonna use a 360 controller for this, as it or a PS4 controller is HIGHLY recommended), hold A to run, hold X to charge an arrow shot, hold X after shooting to recall your arrow and that's your lot for controls. I really don't understand the point of not running all the time, as walking seems to be entirely useless, and could just as easily be assigned to partial pushes of the analog stick. There's also no consequence to running all the time, unlike in the Souls series, so it just feels unnecessary. You can aim your arrow in any direction you want, which is why you really want to use a controller for this game.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I've only fought 13/19 bosses, and for the most part they're pretty well designed (except for a certain Knight which would be pretty rad if not for one really dumb bit of artificial difficulty). These bosses are really where the puzzle elements of this game come to light, as most bosses have some form of puzzle solving to them. Some are pure execution, but others do require a bit of brainpower. You die in one hit in this game, but so does the boss. While this does make finding the solution satisfying, actually beating the bosses feels pretty shallow in the long run. It's about 10-30 seconds of intensity and it's over. There's no gravitas to the bosses, and I think that's my biggest problem with the game.\n\nIt's because of this that I've looked at Titan Souls in my library over the past few days, thought about playing it, then went to play something else. There's no meat to the game; it's all surface layer, at least as far as the main playthrough is concerned. This game isn't a bad couple of hours; it just lacks some panache, is all. 7/10.\n\nStory: Something about souls or whatever i dunno symbolism or stuff. I guess I'm too much of a plebian or something, but I really couldn't find any story worth talking about here. As such, I'm not going to.\n\nGraphics: The detail in the pixel art is quite nice, and I can certainly admire the effort put into this game's art. However, 2D pixel art doesn't do a very good job at making big worlds feel big, I've found. Because of this, long stretches of land just feel dull and lifeless, especially with some cliff faces meant to look big actually looking kinda silly with how long the texture stretches on for. Boss design is pretty neat, but one thing that I don't understand is why some bosses are rendered as sprites and others as 3D models. Well, I should say that I get why from a gameplay perspective that some bosses are 3D models, but I don't think it fits too well with the graphical style that the game was trying to have in all the rest of the world. I think it would've been better if the team had gone either all bosses in 3D or all bosses still in 2D. As for the technical side of things, it runs fine, fullscreening to my native resolution of 1080p without any hassle. Nothing to complain about there. Overall, while I can admire the technical finesse of the art in this game, I feel that as for an overall style that this game is in some places lacking and in other places somewhat confused. 4/5.\n\nSound: The soundtrack to this game is quite good, and I'd recommend giving it a listen outside of the game. Why outside of the game? The bosses will die too quickly for you to be able to hear the songs, unfortunately. While most of this game's OST has a basis in orchestra, it does branch out to some Dream Theater-esque progressive rock every now and then, which is always a nice change of pace. There's not any voice acting apart from Mister Fister yelling at you, so nothing to talk about here. Good showing on the sound portion of things; I just wish I had been able to hear a bit more of the soundtrack in game. 4/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 7/0/4/4; cumulative score of 7.5/10. Again, while I definitely did enjoy my time with the game, I just don't feel compelled to complete the rest of the game. Not that it's frustrating to play or anything; I just don't feel like exploring this world to a great deal of depth. Again, I could see a 100% playthrough taking about four hours, but once again the world just feels too flat for my tastes. For me, it's worth it on a sale, but otherwise the price does feel a bit steep given the amount of content.","April 17, 2015","true","1.9"," 16 of 54 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","16","54","0","1"

The only gameplay is fighting bosses and traversing the world to get from boss to boss. By cutting out all the fluff titan souls has created a richer experience at the cost of overall playtime. If you're looking for a long game then titan souls might not be the game for you as my first playthrough of the game took 3 hours. That being said I typically beat games in about half the time an average player would take (you can probably expect 4-6 hours of unique gameplay).\n\nGame length aside, I found the game to be really enjoyable. The controls are smooth and the gameplay is fluid. The environment looks great and the bosses attack patterns fit together with their respective aesthetics. Each boss battle felt like solving a puzzle. First I had to observe the bosses attack patterns and find out how to dodge them. Then I had to figure out their weakspots and devise an attack pattern that could exploit their respective weaknesses. Lastly I needed the execution to dodge the bosses attacks and successfully put my plan into action.\n\nOn top of actually figuring out the boss fights there is an extra level of difficulty in figuring out the fastest way to kill the bosses. While some of the bosses had extremely dangerous attack patterns there was often a way to kill them in the first 10-15 seconds of the fight. While figuring out these quick kills was fun, I found the game to be slightly too easy when using them on some of the bosses. To counteract this there are achievements for each boss that often require you to not use a quick kill and they also add an extra level of challenge to the fight. If getting all the achievements isn't difficult enough for you, there are new game plus options which add even more difficulty to the game.\n\nWhile the game only took 3 hours for me to complete, I'll proabably spend another 5-10 hours trying to get all of the achievements and completing the new game plus modes that add extra difficulty to the game. This has been one of the most enjoyable games of 2015 so far and I'd recommend it to anyone who doesnt mind the shorter than average game length.","April 14, 2015","true","4.0"," 25 of 75 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","25","75","0","0"

I'm merely posting this as a first impression review of course. But I've gotten the feeling of exuberant joy at beating the first boss that I haven't gotten from ANYTHING else lately. The game concept is similar to Shadow of the collossus in the sense that the game is about fighting big bosses with no faffing about grinding or cutting down hordes of minions. You have an arrow and you don't get more from what I've seen, yet you have such a great time picking up on the quirks of the bosses and figuring out what you must do to take them down. It felt incredible taking the first boss down, partially because I realized that I did it with just some combat rolls and one freakin arrow. The game's visual style is remniscent of the gba zelda games. At the same time it feels very smooth and intuitive. The music is also excellent as it ups in intensity the closer you get to defeating the boss.

That's the core concept: fight, die, learn...and to some people it's a negative thing because we'e flooded with "instant awesomeness" games that you dont have to work especially hard at to be good at. Whereas, with Titan Souls it beats the hell out of you until you get it perfect, and that in itself is a rare quality in a game.\nThe core mechanics of the game are solid, the very first screen tells you to use a gamepad, which doesn't redeem the poor controls without said gamepad, i myself played an entire playthrough with the keyboard and got thouroughly frustrated, but had a much more enjoyable experience when i plugged in my Xbox 360 controller. But what this game does have going for it is its incredibly addicting sense of satisfaction when you finally manage to overcome the obstacles it throws in your face, its absolutely BEAUTIFUL soundtrack, a suprisingly rich atmosphere, and a charmingly simple concept.\nMy overall conclusion for this game was an 8/10, docked down only due to the fact that the experience i had was not as long as i would've liked for the money i spent and the poor PC controls.

You have 1 arrow, and must retrieve it after shooting. You die with one hit. You are completely underpowered and overwhelmed, facing down huge monsters.

The pixel art really suits this game well and makes everything look beautiful, the music can go from a serene stroll to an absolute barrage of instruments either pushing you on or making you feel like the odds are against you. The one hit, one kill system for both the character and the enemies alike keeps things tense, and while it often can be extremely difficult, you slowly learn about how the bosses work and how to kill them, and it always feels like a boss can be defeated. I find this game most relateable to Shadow of the Colossus, given that it's entirely bosses that are Gosh Darn huge, and you feel the same sort of loneliness and beauty (although it's not as sad when each boss dies). The only problem I have with this game is that it makes me swear quite a bit, but, as of yet, I have not found anything else wrong with this game\n\nIn Short: Brilliant sound and graphic design, gameplay is super fun and unique, lets me reminice about Shadow of the Colossus, makes me angrier than I'd like to admit\n\nEdit: I have since completed this game, and wouldn't like to change anything I said. All in all, it lasted me around 6 hours, however, with the extra challenges and the fact that I can now read the bosses' names, I'll definitely revisit this again. Also, in the final few stages of the game, there were times when I thought there was undue difficulty, but when the game is based in part off of Dark Souls, it's reasonable. All things considered, I would recommend the damn diddly out of this game until the end of existence.\n\n(P.S. My favourite Titan was the snow face with the laser fingers and ice teeth, and my favourite area was the forest)","April 15, 2015","true","8.1"," 10 of 41 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","10","41","0","0"

So about the game. Titan Souls has a beautiful soundtrack that goes incredibly well with all of the areas to explore and discover. The idea of having one arrow and one life, is a truly awesome idea in itself. Add that with fighting colossal titans that have a weak point where you can kill them with one blow from your arrow, and you get one epic game!\n\nThe challenge of the game was fairly difficult. I played the entire game with my keyboard, and there were some challenges, and yes, some rage induced moments. But over all I truly loved going from one location to the next, fighting the titans that slumber.\n\nMy favorite titan? The Unkown Titan that you can find in the graveyard. Im not going to give any spoilerinos, but that Titan truly gave me some feels right in the heart.\n\nAll in all, this is a wonderful game that im sure any one could love. I hope that you check it out and hope you fall in love with this game, just as I have.\n\nThis is Cogsdale,\nIll check you later!\n\nOn a scale of 1-10, I rate this game ♥♥♥♥♥♥ically Amazing.","April 17, 2015","true","12.1"," 7 of 34 people (21%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","21","7","34","2","0"

No health bar, no compass, no map. Not a single thing. You die in one hit but, if you hit the weak spot, so do the boss enemies. It's basically a race to see who can land a hit first. Do or die type of situation.\n\nI have to say that the adrenaline rush you get when you spend so long dodging the enemies attacks like crazy, missing shot after shot, you shoot your arrow immediately after rolling into the weak spots line of sight and BAM. You hit your mark and get to drain the soul. It's a wonderful feeling. That's where I get the Demon/Dark souls feeling from this game. Besting that one boss that's always a pain.\n\nThe comparsions between it and shadow of the colossus are quite accurate for quite a number of reasons\n1. You are a small human boy up against creatures of various sizes but all of them bigger than you\n2. All (so far) of these monsters just stand or drift around doing nothing until you provoke them in some way.\n3. The monsters have special weak spots\n4. When killed, you absorb something though you are able to move around a tiny bit before it gets you.\n5. You have to search for these monsters all over the place\n\nI'm sure others will make more comparsions but I'm sure you get the gist by now\n\nI have nothing else to say really other than definitely give this game a try. You won't be disappointed.","April 14, 2015","true","6.1"," 21 of 67 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","21","67","0","0"

The combat, although its simplistic nature, is used in many different ways depending on which Titan you're fighting.

There are tons of soundtracks, all of which are very high quality and fit well to their respective area or titan.\n-Beautiful graphics. The game looks polished.\n-Challenging combat.\n-The game respects the intelligence of the player and doesn't tell you everything you need to do.\n\nCONS:\n-The game is meant to be played with a gamepad. Using a keyboard makes Titans much more difficult to defeat.\n-Frustrating at times when game mechanics fight against you. This might be different with a gamepad.\n-World seems a bit too "dead" in the sense that there is not much you can interact with.

Check out my Build-a-Review\n\nPros:\n_Pretty: Yes, I know, we're all sick of pixel art. I like it though, I think it looks really nice, with soft coloring and minimalistic style that makes the game seems both familiar and foreign at the same time. Great attention to details too, your character's breath will become vapors in cold area, for example.\n_Sounds nice: Punchy sound effects when you loose your arrow, or when the bosses attack you. Good ambient as well. Also, the music is terrific, particularly boss fight music.\n_Interesting gameplay: This is what makes this game all the money here. The game gives you one, ONE, arrow, and you have to kill every boss with it. The whole game then becomes a really heart pounding game of catch with yourself, where you find opportunity to loose an arrow, then go pick it up (or leave yourself open to call the arrow back to you), then find another opening; meanwhile, you're also dodging every attack coming out of the bosses AND trying to decipher their patterns and weaknesses. It's intense! There's no tricks here, no grinding, no stats, no help. Either you're good enough, or you're not.\n_Difficult: It's real hard. Never unfair though.\n_Boss Rush Mode all the time, and all the time Boss Rush Mode: It's all about fighting bosses, it's all about fighting really cool-looking bosses, it's all about fighting really cool-looking, well-designed bosses with devious, satisfying patterns that work in the exact way you'd think they'd logically work.\n_Cool sense of style: The game seems to have a vision of what it wanted to be and went for it. The way the lights, the sounds and music kick in and time out are all impecable. Killing a boss, for example, will flood the screen with bright light and a stream of loud sounds, almost symbolic of the joy the player feels defeating a tough enemy. Then in a moment, it all drowns out. The player is left with a dim, color-muted room in total silence; mournful of what was once a worthy opponent... It's really cool, is what I'm trying to say.\n\nCons:\n_Can be pretty bad in term of pacing: Listen, if you're designing a game that you KNOW will be difficult, design it with the least amount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t possible. The player dies a whole lot in your game, so don't sit them through a loading screen, spawn them outside of the boss room, make them walk back inside, then sit them through another loading screen. Just spawn them in the boss room! Don't put in so much downtime in between the gameplay for no reason.\n\nOverall, is it worth $15? Despite my mini rant about the game's pacing there, I'd still whole-heartedly recommend this game. It's good! Simple, challenging, interesting and unique. It's pretty, too, which doesn't hurt.","April 14, 2015","true","1.6"," 21 of 68 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","21","68","0","0"

This is a very difficult game and it should be expected as so because you are fighting bosses. It is a great game because not many games can tell you a story without saying a word. There are amazing visual effects and simple mechanics. The game recommends a controller and I would too. The small amout of controls are not for a keyboard and the fact that the game uses a top, down perspective with arrow keys doesn't help. A 360 degree line of fire is need to make good shots.

Coming from Ludum Dare, nothing was compromised from the overall vision in the full release. Having put several hours into the original concept, this is still a very challenging game. Each boss is very unique, requiring different tactics to defeat them. It is a game where you will most likely play in bite-sized sessions due to needing a break from the difficulty. The controls are responsive, and I haven't had a death that seemed like it was the game's fault.\nMy favorite part of this game is the atmosphere and music. It harkens back to the open, empy world from Shadow of the Colossus. With some imagination, each area tells a story. I thoroughly enjoy exploring the (though very small) world.\n\nIt can get somewhat repetitive at times. When you die to a boss, and just want to restart at the door, the game will warp you back to your last save. These are not far from each boss area, so this is more a nitpick than anything.\nAnother gripe I have is with the addition of 3D graphics on some bosses. With an orthographic game camera, it is difficult to pin point the exact location of weak points on some 3D bosses, or judge where projectiles will land.\n\nIn any case, this game is a great experience. A test of skill and determination. I give it:\nArbitrary_Score/10","April 14, 2015","true","1.8"," 26 of 81 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","26","81","0","0"

That being said a skilled player could finish the games extra 4 modes and the permutations of said modes in around 10-15hrs. If you're not a completionist and just like to beat a game once you should probably hold off until a 20% or more discount comes around for this. The ratio of gametime to price reminds of me dishonored, you might be upset about it's length but with these types of games you're paying about 20-30% of the cost for the art and not the gameplay.

While that sounds like it would be really easy, it's the fact that you have to figure out exactly where and when your shot needs to be taken.  Oftentimes you have less than a half second to make that call. Since the bosses are one hit kill, it makes it just SO satisfying to get that one shot that rings true, stopping the madness around you.  Every boss is unique and they all require creative thought on how to best approach them, or get them to reveal their weakness. While many of the bosses require you use their own attacks against them, that's only to open their weak point, where you then finish the job yourself.  Every kill feels earned, and (almost) every death feels fair.\n\nPros:\n==========\n+Difficult\n+Beautiful Graphics\n+Awesome Music\n+Great Concept\n+Very crisp, yet simple controls\n\nCons:\n==========\n-Some bosses are far away from spawn points, which can be frustrating for more difficult bosses because you have to walk all the way back every time\n-Fairly short\n\nNitpicks:\n==========\n*The story is... Well, this is the kind of game where you make your own story up.  I feel like it could have easily been told in the transitional areas from boss to boss, but it wouldn't add or detract from gameplay.\n*There's a maze. Nobody likes mazes. (Here's a hint: Left Up Up, and Right Left Up)\n*Some of the boss doors are hidden. I never had to look at a guide, but I can see some of them being easily missed.\n*A map would be handy.\n\nAll in all, I found this title to definitely be worth the asking price. I'm certain it will go on sale at some point in the future, so if you're unsure, buy it then.

I felt that everything was on point; the music, definitely the art, I felt the boss fights were hard but fair, and what story it had was fun to piece together. Titan Souls really emphisizes making your shot count by making a miss lead to having to kite or wait a second to get the arrow back to you which leaves you open, which I really enjoyed. You have to be quick and precise.\nWith all of these good things said about it, there are some bad. The game is relitively short. I beat it in around 2 hours the first time around and for the price (17 CAD) it may not be worth it to you if you aren't looking to play it more than once. As well I had a few weird visual bugs on startup but nothing while playing the actual game.\nIf you are the kind of person to do speed runs, new game +, and game modifiers or achievement hunting(quite fun in this game), I'll reccomend it to you. if you aren't into that, pick it up in the summer sale.\n","April 16, 2015","true","6.2"," 39 of 113 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","39","113","0","0"

I'm still not sure how I feel about this game. I'll put a positive for now, because I think its pros outweight its cons.\n\nVideo Review (my opinion has changed a bit since the episode):\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ELdJlq14HSY\n\nWhat is it?\n\nTitan Souls is a game about fighting giant bosses with only one arrow. Each boss has a particular weakness that you need to find and exploit. The gameplay is made to be difficult (similar to Dark Souls). Beating the bosses will be based upon your own skill (and luck) rather than your characters progression (which isn't actually a thing).\n\nSo that's what it is. Why am I on the fence about the game? The main irksome part of the game is everything in between the bosses. The world (once you get past the first area) is MASSIVE. Travelling between two respawn points feels incredibly tedious.\n\nThen you get an even bigger issue. There is a forest section. It is a Lost Woods scenario. In other words, it is a maze that sends you back to the beginning if you go the wrong way. I found the first boss, and can't find the second. I don't see any reason that a section like this would be in the game. You do nothing but keep trying new paths (which will end up taking a long time). I left after about twenty minutes of searching for the second boss.\n\nI also have a smaller problem with the game. I feel like some of the weak spots on the bosses are far too obscure.  One boss is the Titan Slayer, a giant guy who shoots arrows. The way to kill him is to shoot his arrow and then shoot him again. The Tell is that he goes XRay at the beginning of the fight (if you see it you'll understand). If you're in the wrong position you won't even see that (I didn't the first time, the screne was cut off). I also still havn't figured out what to do against the magma slime. I think it's to shoot it in the mouth, but there's no clear indication.\n\nPros:\n\n-Difficult gameplay that is rewarding when you succeed.\n\n-Wide variety of bosses. Each of them is significantly different.\n\n-Responsive controls. That's very important for a game that relys on difficulty.\n\n-Lots of bosses. There are more than fifteen bosses (I'm pretty sure). You will spend quite a while beating them.\n\nCons:\n\n-Massive empty world. Really, the only thing out there are a few obscure glyphs. It has no reason to be so large.\n\n-Lost Woods. See above.\n\n-The game never teaches you how to sprint. It's holding down the roll button. It really should have said something.\n\n-The game is clearly not made for the computer. It says that it is recommended that you play with a controller, and I very quickly foudn out why. It's very hard to aim with a keyboard. It's possible to do it, but a controller would be MUCH easier.\n\nOverall, I can't extatically recommend the game. If you want difficult boss fights, it will fit the bill on that mark. It is not a must have game, but it's not so terrible that I would warn you against it. I think you get the idea.","April 18, 2015","true","1.2"," 5 of 33 people (15%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","15","5","33","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamblore/recommended/297130/","gamblore","Gamblore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamblore/","657 products in account","Game is pretty, fun, but not a strong recomendation. If you like figuring out the mechanics of boss fights in games check it out as there are not many games like this. Don't watch any Let's Plays on this game because you really don't want to know anything about the boss' mechanics, as figuring them out is the game.\n\nI feel they had a whole thing about making it a journey rather than a game you rush through. That isn't always great when most of the bosses you can figure out how to kill with very few deaths but it will still take you many more times to trick it into doing what you need it to do and then get the timing/control right. This leads you to taking long slow strolls (and rolls) to get back to the boss even after you know what you have to do. Also the placement of steps making it so you can't roll/run back to a boss sometimes is anoying because you know they did it on purpose to make you go slower.\n\nThe world is pretty but when I finished the game I didn't expect it to be over, I kind of just explored my way to the ending while still missing a huge section of the world all together. It is hard to know how far you have progressed and what you haven't covered. The map in the special edition probably would have helped with that if I had that edition.","April 19, 2015","true","3.1"," 7 of 38 people (18%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","18","7","38","2","0"

Also, am i the only one having trouble with the main characters gender? I think it's a girl, but majority of the players say it's a guy. Anywho, loved this game!

Beaten the game with in the first 1.5 hours, but with only killing 13 of the possible 19 Titans. These numbers and times are blind, no wikis, no videos. I consider myself an average gamer so do with that what you will.\n\nThe Review\nI want to start by saying I hadn't followed this games development. It's something I heard about but never really stopped to look at. So the comparison to Shadows of the Colossus type of game never really hyped it up for me or gave me game mechanic expectations. (I've never played SotC) I went into this game with no knowledge other than it was exceedingly brutal, one shot kill / death and nothing but boss mobs.\n\nWith that information, I had a pretty good idea the game wasn't going to be a marathon 20+ hour game.\n\nSo what did I think of it? In a few words, It's great!\n\nThe core mechanics are extremely basic, 2 button controls and easy to pick up and intuitive. They are enjoyable and very responsive. When you die, it's not because you were cheated via some long drawn out animation sequence, it's because YOU pushed a button too soon, or too late.\n\nThe game is relentless, some of the titans only showing their weak spots for a fraction of a second. I've seen some people complain that "You can't beat it unless you get lucky" I just want to stop you right there, because you can in fact manipulate all of these titans to showing the weak spot exactly where you want, once you figure out their patterns. It's a very skill driven game, that requires patience and precision. So in my opinion, this is where a lot of the frustration comes from.\n\nThere's not really an "entry level" into this game, if your reflexes aren't upto the task, you will have a hard time. If pattern recognition is tough for you, you WILL have a hard time. Then it really does feel it comes down to luck. For the skilled out there, controlling that titan to the extent of creating an opening and nailing that perfect shot... it's very satisfying\n\nControls are a bit of an issue here, not just because the key bindings are horrific for the keyboard. But because you only have the ability to shoot on 8-axis. In a game where precision is the difference between winning and losing, it boggles my mind why there is no mouse control to shoot and aim the bow. While having movement on the keyboard.\n\nMy personal gripe is that the world, although very interesting to look at with some great areas, is empty. It feels to me like it could have been half the size (at least) and still given the exact same impression. Without the likes of trash mobs to make travelling from point to point challenging, it makes those long distances boring and uncalled for.\n\nbellow I will just outline the key points as I always do in these reviews.\n\nThe GoodPixel art and setting is great.\nMusic is fantastic.\ncontrols are responsive.\nVariety in titans is impressive\nThe BadThe main area is far to big.\nStory could have been so much more.\nKeyboard Controls limit you, heavily.\nfrustrating for lower skilled players.\nThe Verdict\nFun and Unique experience - Reaps Recommended\n\n\nAll in all this offers a vary unique experience for this style of game. Sure you can kill a select few titans, and end the game within the hour if you know where you were going. But to complete the entire game killing all Titans, without knowing the strats and having seen the bosses before, I believe you are getting good value for money. Throw in the other game modes once you complete the game, and the timer to compete with friends. It adds up to pretty good re-playability.","April 20, 2015","true","9.3"," 9 of 50 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","9","50","0","0"

While it does succeed at being punishing, it feels like the creators missed the mark on making the boss fights themselves satisfying. It does feel nice to finally hit the mark on your target, however, the majority of the fighting feels like a big setup for the final shot. There's no slow progression towards beating individual bosses. You eventually figure out how to beat the boss and wait until the stars align for the right moment. This is especially apparent in a few Titan fights where the setup is the longest part of the fight. I did not feel like getting to the bosses was very long like others have expressed although I  feel like most of your time is spent doing this for some bosses.\n\nOverall the visuals are good for an 8-bit style game and the OST is excellent, especially in the fire level. However, the vague story and little explaination leaves more to be desired. It would have been nice to see some leveling up with the bow (range/attack speed) or the character (faster dodges) like there was in SotC. As for the gameplay, a controller is REQUIRED. The KB+Mouse controls are lazy and could have been made better to allow for more than 8 directions of movement and shooting.\n\nIf you enjoy grinding away at bosses over and over then you should consider buying it when it goes on sale for $5 or less since the game is so short.","December 1, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

At first I didn't know whether this was gonna be a game I can get into after simply watching the video on the store page, but then I noticed it had a demo download.  So I DL'd the demo played it and was like "I could get into this."  Bought the game later and played it at times like before heading off to work or before going to bed, so my progression was slow at first.  One day I decided to grind the game out.  When I pulled stupid moves that caused me to die, I couldn't help but laugh becuase it was just simply funny to die the way I did. after three and a half...ish hours I couldn't belive I had won.  Some titans were fun, some were too easy. but in the end I did enjoy the game on the first playthrough and will make another day to attempt the achievements I didn't get by accident on the first playthrough.   I don't see myself getting the 'beat the game in 20 min' achievement but perhaps another happy accident could happen.\n\nA friend later told me about how there was a supposed twitter fued between a developer and totalbiscuit and I was like "who cares!?"  Outside opinions on a game from a reviewer doesn't appeal to me.  I can simply try it for myself and I'll either like it or dislike it.  But my homeboy is a TB fanboy for some reason and he said "because TB doesnt like it and had a twitter fight with a developer is enough for me to not try it"  ok, Don't think for yourself there buddy.  I tried it I liked it and others will too.  Sure not every game is for everyone, I personally don't like too many shooter games but that doesn't mean I dislike the entire genre.  Some games win and some games lose and not all that win are based on high profile game reviewers. Its a lot like movie reviews.  Critics didn't like Boondock Saints but the public did. So all in all try for yourself and make your own decision.","August 23, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not recommended for those who give up easily.\n\nLong version:\nI got this game in the Humble bundle and thought to myself "hey this sounds nice"\n\n\nStarting it up it wasn't too difficult they introduce you fairly nicely tot he concept of the game as a whole.  You have one arrow that you can retract, you can roll out of the way.  The dificulty curve shifts into high gear after the 3 or forth fight, but it goes all over the place.  Some fights were easier then others and one (for me personally) was ridculously difficult.\n\nThe first thing, was it fun?  Yes.  I'm not used to playing the "you are gonna die alot" games.  The learning curve was enough for me to be emmerised in the game play.  Each boss was just slightly different enough to not have the same strategy to win.  Oh and by boss I mean the only things in the game.\n\nEach boss is difficult in its own nature.  Strategy is key and there is no way around first time playing dying...or the second....or the 35th in one particular case. but the game never presents itself as impossible.  It is pretty clear how one can kill a titan, but it is like an active puzzle.  An active puzzle trying to kill you.  There is a high level of satisfaction for seeing everything laid before you and actually executing them.\n\nThe "rest of the game" is walking to them.  For pixel top down art it is very beautiful.  In fact the game is all kinds of beutiful.  There is no way around that fact.\n\nNow for my one true gripe with this other wise wonderful game.   The story.  It was given in very very small doses and never explained in my playthrough.  Why am I doing this?  What do I gain?  What are all these carvings on the wall meaning.  Why can't I read the titan's name?   In the first playthrough you get nothing.  One Titan says something to you.  the only one that talks, but its vauge enough to make you start to wonder what the hell you are, they are and the goal or even the reason for doing this.  And it is never answered.  Hell maybe a second playthrough is needed, but I find that rather tedious.\n\nSo like I said in the short version.  This is not a game fro people who get frustrated and give up.  It is short but gives you what you need.    SO if you play this from my recommendation I say, don't give up.  Fight to the end.\n\n","March 27","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You'll get frustrated quickly constantly having to respawn if you treat this game like other instant death games.

It's only when you have to fight back and dodge that things become hard.\n\nTL;DR – PLAY THE DEMO!!!!","March 27","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And there's a lot to like. The atmosphere, design, and the titans themselves are all wonderfully well-crafted. But a couple of major flaws stick out like sore thumbs and thoroughly spoil what would've otherwise been a fantasically well-executed concept.\n\nFlaw the First: Checkpoints. Many other reviews have pointed this out. When you die at the hands of a titan, you don't respawn at the entrance to the arena, but at the last checkpoint you crossed, and then you have to trudge back to the arena to start the fight again. The journey may be a short one, but since the fights themselves can be even shorter, this impedes the flow of gameplay, especially since the journeys are uneventful and repetitive. If the intent was to allow the player to decide to fight a different titan when they die, this was an ungainly way to do it. I'm sure no one would mind walking back from the arena to the checkpoint after respawning if it means we can get back into the action that much faster.\n\nFlaw the Second: Difficulty Plateau. You're free to fight the titans in any order you please, and I suppose the idea was to offset the high level of difficulty with a glut of choice. In reality, the lack of an actual difficulty curve (combined with the poor checkpoint system) only means that you'll likely be frustrated no matter which titan you choose to fight. For a game that borrows so much from Shadow of the Colossus, it's a shame they didn't try to emulate the excellent difficulty curve of that game.\n\nI think fixing the first flaw would significantly diminish the second. The two parts of the game -- majestic, moody exploration and fast, twitch-shooter action -- are best kept segregated, rather than abruptly switching between them as is the currently the case. EIther way, until one of these glaring issues are addressed, I can't really recommend this game without fear of losing friends.","March 20","false","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first I didn't know whether this was gonna be a game I can get into after simply watching the video on the store page, but then I noticed it had a demo download.  So I DL'd the demo played it and was like "I could get into this."  Bought the game later and played it at times like before heading off to work or before going to bed, so my progression was slow at first.  One day I decided to grind the game out.  When I pulled stupid moves that caused me to die, I couldn't help but laugh becuase it was just simply funny to die the way I did. after three and a half...ish hours I couldn't belive I had won.  Some titans were fun, some were too easy. but in the end I did enjoy the game on the first playthrough and will make another day to attempt the achievements I didn't get by accident on the first playthrough.   I don't see myself getting the 'beat the game in 20 min' achievement but perhaps another happy accident could happen.\n\nA friend later told me about how there was a supposed twitter fued between a developer and totalbiscuit and I was like "who cares!?"  Outside opinions on a game from a reviewer doesn't appeal to me.  I can simply try it for myself and I'll either like it or dislike it.  But my homeboy is a TB fanboy for some reason and he said "because TB doesnt like it and had a twitter fight with a developer is enough for me to not try it"  ok, Don't think for yourself there buddy.

However, it is difficult. And by difficult, I mean you will become frustrated, no matter how much a fan of difficult games you are. While I give this game a "Yes" recommendation, it's games like this that make me with there was a neutral recommendation to offer, between Yes and No.\n\nLooking and feeling similar to a 2D Shadow of the Collossus, the game pits you and your unnamed hero against a bunch of boss battles in an atmospheric, ancient environment. You get a single arrow, which you can call back to you after you fire it.\n\nThat's about it. You take that arrow and try to kill a number of unforgiving bosses. The formula is mostly the same for all of them: find their likely weak point, and try to put the pointy part of your arrow into it. Some bosses deviate from this pattern, but not often. The enjoyment taken from trying to figure out how to kill the boss is turned quickly into frustration as you spend more time trying to avoid being squished, burned, decapitated, frozen, gutted, blown up, melted, incinerated, eviscerated, or turned into a red mist then you do trying to hit them. Unlike similar games, you have little opportunity to learn any form of pattern the bosses follow and determine how to defeat them; dying several times within 10 seconds of the start of the battle will have to be expected.\n\nI suppose the hellish jog back to the boss room from a save point after each fight gives you enough time to contemplate what you could have done differently. Usually, unfortunately, the answer will be "not a hell of a lot".\n\nThe game is both brutal and beautiful. But if you're lacking in patience, stay clear.\n\nBest recommendation? Pick the game up on sale. I commend the creators for what would be an otherwise perfect game in all regards, except for how absolutely unforgiving it is, and how long it takes for you to try again after you (inevitably) (repeatedly) fail.","March 16","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm glad to say this was the right decision.\n\nDespite the game's simple controls, every single boss manages to add something new, each one with a distinctively different feel. Despite the difficulty of the game and the number of commentators who seem to believe otherwise, 'cheap kills' are few and far between. Each boss has a very much readable pattern, and mixed with the game's well-built control system, if you die you know it's your fault. Sure, you may (probably) will die the first one or two times as you try and work out the boss's pattern, but then you jump back in and you do better. This system promotes natural, fluid grinding and player growth and it is exactly how a game like this should be. One major point, uncommon in most 'hard' games, is that the bosses, much like yourself, all die in one hit. To kill them takes less than thirty seconds or a minute each, and this removes a lot of the false difficulty inherent in long boss fights without checkpoints in favour of a honing of skills, and a puzzle-like search of the correct method of victory. Playing back through the game now to get the boss-specific achievements, it is immediately noticeable how much easier every single boss is, and that is a very good sign of the prevalence of skill over luck in the fights.\n\nOn top of this exceptional combat, the art, music (every single boss has their own, characteristic theme!) and overall mysterious and exciting theme of discovery in the hub world, this game is an utter joy to experience. And, as someone who likes partially concealed stories (see Braid, Fez, etc.), the odd hints scattered throughout the game towards a greater story, and the speculations and theories surrounding them, are very enjoyable to chase after.\n\nIf it were just for the battles and the walking, this game would be close to perfect, however the gripes about the respawning are not misplaced. Especially when you're getting the grips of each boss, or fighting one like the Knight Titan with an extended introduction, the time wasted on getting back to the boss is a real, unavoidable downside. There is an argument to be made for the extra pressure added by this or perhaps a plot-relevant concept of travel or punishment or some such, but there comes a point when the gameplay of a game must be considered the most important thing. I will say, while I hate to admit it, there was one benefit in walking back to the bosses in that through the calming music and the cathartic mashing of the 'roll to go faster button', the stress of dying was actually somewhat relieved. Perhaps I did find more enjoyment beating the bosses this way than I would otherwise, but I can't really say one way or another. The one thing in my mind that is truly, absolutely unnecessary and which it seems most people are forgetting is the respawning itself. The dull six seconds of fading out, fading in and getting up. At least when I am walking I am listening to music and pressing buttons: I am playing. When I am respawning, I am just bored. At this point it is not a game.\n\nAll in all, if you like challenging or explorative games, I would suggest trying Titan Souls. While I do not believe it is a plus point, I feel the respawn system is not enough to ruin an otherwise very well-designed game. What really stands out is the addictive gameplay, engaging plot, and captivating soundtrack.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nSound: 7/10\nArt: 7/10\nStory: 8/10\nOverall: 7.5/10","April 7","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's all about fighting bosses. Everything dies in one hit including you. There is no upgrade system; you just have to get better and be better than the game. If you enjoy the souls series you will appriciate this game\n\n8.5/10","September 8, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first I didn't know whether this was gonna be a game I can get into after simply watching the video on the store page, but then I noticed it had a demo download.  So I DL'd the demo played it and was like "I could get into this."  Bought the game later and played it at times like before heading off to work or before going to bed, so my progression was slow at first.  One day I decided to grind the game out.  When I pulled stupid moves that caused me to die, I couldn't help but laugh becuase it was just simply funny to die the way I did. after three and a half...ish hours I couldn't belive I had won.  Some titans were fun, some were too easy. but in the end I did enjoy the game on the first playthrough and will make another day to attempt the achievements I didn't get by accident on the first playthrough.   I don't see myself getting the 'beat the game in 20 min' achievement but perhaps another happy accident could happen.\n\nA friend later told me about how there was a supposed twitter fued between a developer and totalbiscuit and I was like "who cares!?"  Outside opinions on a game from a reviewer doesn't appeal to me.  I can simply try it for myself and I'll either like it or dislike it.  But my homeboy is a TB fanboy for some reason and he said "because TB doesnt like it and had a twitter fight with a developer is enough for me to not try it"  ok, Don't think for yourself there buddy.  I tried it I liked it and others will too.  Sure not every game is for everyone, I personally don't like too many shooter games but that doesn't mean I dislike the entire genre.  Some games win and some games lose and not all that win are based on high profile game reviewers. Its a lot like movie reviews.  Critics didn't like Boondock Saints but the public did. So all in all try for yourself and make your own decision.","August 23, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, the game does not offer much more than that.  There is little in terms of story and not much replay value besides the different gamemodes and achievements. I would reccomend, but only if its on sale.","August 23, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
