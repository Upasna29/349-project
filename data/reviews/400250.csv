Sure, it looks like a relaxing Heaven over there, but what do you exactly have to do over there?\n\nI don't mind playing a game with absolutely no objectives or type of story involved, but if you can't really do anything other than walking or sprinting across the islands, then it can get rather boring really quickly. You can't interact with objects or anything like that.\n\nThere isn't much audio or sounds that exists in this game. All I could hear was the ambience of the ocean waves crashing onto the shore and some water splashing when I go into the water. At least adding some good background music would be nice.\n\nThe VR support feature is also nice for people who do have the Oculus Rift and other things.\n\nThe only thing I really liked about this game was that it really does give you that relaxing vacation paradise feel when you experience it, but that's about it. Oh and lets not forget about the trading cards to help you level up once more.\n\nIn conclusion, this could've gotten much, much more potential, but as it stands right now, I can't recommend this.\n\nShould you buy this game?Looking for something cheap?

Mouse sens is totally messed, if you dont have a VR headset, DONT buy this game... and at the current time of this review's first writing, there aren't really alot of VR headset's available.\n2. Very barebones. I honestly can see the potential for a really good narrative, and it's sort of a test for the future of VR MMO's but even for 54 cents its pretty lackluster, there's not really any gameplay element other than finding things and picking them up into infinite inventory space that you cant even view, and looking at books that are written randomly on the island.\n3. Glitchy, there are many spots you can get stuck in that just exist probably because of Dev overlook, causing you to resart the game and look around again at this game's minimal replayablility.\n4.

However the game has 8 out of 15 card drops and achievements attainable in a time frame of 30 - 50 minutes. The dev of this game is asking the community for improvements in the community hub.\n\nReview:  Heaven Island - VR MMO  has little to no gameplay, with the only actions available to you is to sprint, jump and collect shells and apples, only for the purpose of achievements. Upon starting the game, you are launched into this big blue ball of glowing orbs, which are used to represent other players "souls". Once figuring out how to move, (as the game gives you no instructions,) you are able to explore the map that is surprisingly large. Unfortunately, most players would've/ will not explore that far, as the majority of apples/ shells are close to the spawn. There are a number of quotes around the map, which is the main objective of the game. The more quotes you read, the more enlightend you become. This is shown by your "soul" changing colurs from blue to green.\n\nThe graphics are not bad, but not good either. Some places on the map make for good screenshot opportunities, whilst others are this glaring, glitchy mess of textures clipping together. Another unsatisfactory factor of the game is the menu, or the lack there of. Also the game seems to be locked at 30 fps, without a way to change it. I'm sure some people may be able to unlock this by searching the games files, but I wouldn't bother for this game.\n\nAudio is fairly nice in this game, accompanied by the relaxing sounds of waves. However the audio is often cut off by a wave, or when you decide to move to another location. If you had this game before the soundtrack had came out, you would have gotten it for free. The soundtrack itself is satisfactory but you can probably find similar music for free on Youtube.\n\nAnother thing I dislike about this game is the amount of cards you would have to get to complete the full set. This just seems like (to me) a desperate attempt to scrape a few more pennies into the devs hand. The emoticons and backgrounds themself aren't particularly pleasing, and generally sell for a low price in the community market.\n\nOverall, I think this game is just not good enough at it's current state. Whilst the achievements may be a redeeming feature for an easy 100% game, it doesn't justify the price. The only time I would suggest this game is if it was free to play, as it feels like a "tester" game of sorts, as if the dev is just practicing making a environment. This is fine, but I don't think people should pay for it.\n\nIf you like my review, any feedback is appreciated and if you would like to see more reviews from me in the future, feel free to follow me!","April 29","false","10.8"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","37","42","2","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/400250/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1597 products in account","Heaven Island is a simple and cheap walking simulator set on a tropical island. When you enter the game, you will be surrounded by sand and water as far as the eye can see, but the deeper you venture into the island the more tropical elements you will find.\n\nAnyone who is considering picking up Heaven Island needs to know two things; do not expect any form of challenge, and do not expect any in-depth detail. This game is meant for a purely relaxational experience, so it is void of any form of puzzles. As well, it's a dollar game, the island is not crawling with exotic inhabitants. At the very best, you get about 3-4 different kinds of fish swimming in the ocean, the occasional butterfly and some sea turtles.\n\nWhile I found the visuals of the game passable, the audio here is deplorable. Heaven Island is marketing itself as a VR game. One of the most important features to any VR title is the audio. I use a Corsair Void Wireless 7.1 headset, and I will say that the sound is 2.0 at best. There are sections of the game that do not even have any sound, or the sound cuts out abruptly. You will hear some crashing waves and the odd flock of seagulls squawking, but that's about it. The sound is never consistent, and as such neither is my immersion in this "VR" game.\n\nThe latest addition to the game are achievements, which you can obtain by collecting 70 apples and 70 shells. This is not an especially grueling task, so long as you're prepared to scour every nook and cranny of the island and areas within the ocean. However, there is no in-game counter to help you keep track of what you have collected. Having to keep a tally in your head or on paper also causes the immersion in this "VR" experience to fly out the window. A simple counter is not hard to implement. I should also point out that if you exit the game, your progress is reset.\n\nI was 36 shells in when Heaven Island decided to abruptly dump me back to the starting area, logo and all, effectively resetting my shell collecting. Up to that point, I was having a mildly fun and mostly relaxing time playing the game. The fun left when the entire game reset, and I decided that I'd had enough of wandering around the island for now. It's cool to see other people who are playing the game, as indicated by their blue orbs scattered about. If you turn around fast enough, you can see your own blue orb trail. At first, I thought it was someone trolling me by following my every movement, I found it funny when I realized that it wasn't and it was just my own blue orb trail.\n\nOverall, you get what you pay for. Heaven Island can hardly classify itself as a VR, and it should remove the MMO from its title. There are numerous bugs that need to be fixed, the developer released a game that really was not ready to be released yet. This game could be made a lot better with the implementation of better sound, more sound effects, an in-game counter for shells and apples, and a fix for the game-killing bugs. In its current state, I would not recommend this title... not even for a buck.\n\nEdit: The developer has implemented new features, such as now when you exit the game your shell/apple collecting process is saved. You can now interact with more objects on the island. There are more fish as well.\n\nRating: 2.0/5.0 - It's not awful, but it's not great.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","January 16","false","5.7"," 42 of 51 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","42","51","0","6"

The game as it is now is CRAPTACULAR but I believe it can do better if the devs are willing to listen to the community feedback.\n\nParadise Island - VR MMO as the genre suggest is a Walking Simulator. There are no objectives there's basically nothing to do in the game except walking and collecting shells/apples.\n\nThere's a TL;DR at the bottom of this review.\n\nFirst few seconds of my playthrough\nFirst thing I noticed is that the game didn't have any HUD. I tried pressing "Esc" hoping it would pause the game and bring me a series of menu or a settings page but it ended up closing the game. //facepalm// Turns out that the game didn't have anything else to offer except the exploration itself and the startup window.\n\nSince the game has no objectives or whatsoever. Don't expect any tutorial or pointers in the game. You either learn them yourself by trying the keys or check the Input tab in the startup window. The only thing you'll ever need are the movement and picking controls anyway, even with jumping there's nothing to use it for in the game. (more details about this later)\n\nThe game also disconnects you when you idle and puts you back to the respawn point. It can be a big disappointed when you finally found some interesting things to see only to end up on the starting area because you need to do some other stuff before.\n\nThe World\nAlthough the game gives off a relaxing atmosphere the doodads scattered all over the island could use a heavy touch-up. There are some grounds and woods that includes a very detailed texture (probably an actual photograph) but stretched to the core. There are also textures that are just plain flat colors. Makes you wonder if the contents of the game are just random 3d models taken in the internet. The trees are the most abundant and also the ugliest object you'd see in the game. They're like standing papers with a tree drawn in it, they look really flat and just floating around and not actually planted on the ground.\n\nThe world barely contain anything. and if it does they're all static objects. You'd see a door or maybe a chair or a bench but you cannot interact with them. They are just there for the eyes. Heck, even the collisions are poorly made. You can walk through most objects and sometimes even end up on the roof of a building by simply walking in it.\n\nGameplay\nCollecting shells and apples are the only thing you could do in this game. And those doesn't even have any importance nor it does ANY kind of changes in the game so there's really no point in doing it. You won't even see an inventory where your items are supposed to be stored. The only reason to even bother doing this at all is if you're in for the achievements.\n\nThe exploration itself is also a huge mess. Firstly, you don't feel that you are actually exploring during the game. There are no movement and environmental sounds. You hear a small gushing of waters and maybe the insects but they make the immersion worse since all you will hear are annoying loops. You can't even swim you just walk your way through the water and feel the same when you explore on lands. Fishes doesn't give a damn. Doors can't be opened, Ladders can't be climbed. It's literally a walking simulator.\n\nTL;DR;\nI would not recommend this game even if it cost stupidly cheap. But I might if you're interested for an easy 100% achievement. Despite the game having a potential it's not even 1/4 close to achieving it. This game might improved or it may not only time will tell.\n\n[ Quick-Edit ]\n\nTurns out even the achievement earning is bugged. The game's worth nothing at the moment.","January 20","false","11.2"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","25","29","0","0"

When I look at my game completion %, my obsessive compulsive tendencies take over. Next thing I know, I'm looking for games to play (or replay) in the hopes of scoring some easy achievements.\n\nWell, Heaven Island certainly succeeds in this regard. If you have 30 minutes, then you can 100% this game. Although, now I find myself questioning the purpose of this game. Is it to relax? I don't think so. Yes, there is some relaxing imagery like beaches and butterflies. However, the entire time you're playing this game, you're engaging in busy-work.\n\nWhile you're scouring the island for seashells and apples, you're bound to stumble upon "enlightening" quotes. You might even find the Buddhist temple. As far as I can tell, this trip to Heaven Island isn't some idle vacation.

You can't tie that to an achievement.\n\nThis is all well and good, but where's the sense of self? While exploring this island, you are not *you*. You're not even a person. You're a floating orb of nothingness. All of these benches, beds, and beach-side folding chairs? They hold no meaning to you. What use are all of these apples, if they can't be eaten? You can't sit, sleep, eat, drink, or doing anything that could be considered relaxing. All you can do is collect things, because that's your purpose.\n\nThis reminds me of the endings to various videogames that I've played. In order to save the world from a great evil, the hero sacrifices themself. Afterwards, the Gods or the Ancients or whatever give the hero some great power, when all the hero really wanted was to be back at home with their loved ones. When I'm on Heaven Island, I don't want to be the floating orb of nothingness. I would rather be a fish, or a bird, or anything capable of living. Instead, I'm the all-seeing eye, cursed to witness the world from afar.\n\nIf you want a vacation, then take a real one. If that's not possible, then install Skyrim. Get yourself a few tropical island mods, throw on a bikini, and go kill mudcrabs for an hour. At least you won't find yourself questioning the meaning of existence.\n\nIn short: Heaven Island made me ask too many questions, when I'd rather not think at all.","May 31","false","4.6"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","14","14","2","0"

I'm not even sure why it is an online game.  You can see other people as some sort of floating spirit ball, but there is no interacting with other people, or objects, other than picking up apples or shells.  I don't really understand why everybody keeps claiming that the graphics are fantastic.  I have them all the way up to the highest settings and I wouldn't even say that it meets the medium threshold of a lot of other games out there.  Overall, just walking around, no settings to change, not even a basic menu or user interface.  You can't jump or crouch and the lack of being able to move over terrain is frustrating, especially when you go into the second floor of a house that you get stuck in because there is a ledge which is 2 inches tall and you get trapped and have to start the game over to look for more apples and seashells.  It might be more enjoyable with a VR device, but that still wouldn't make it anymore of a game.  It seems like an early access title, but it is not labeled as one on steam.  So if the developer is planning on making some huge improvements then this "game" is not finished and deserves no further examination.\n\nEdit: They added the ability to jump now.  Or rather, "Float"","January 7","false","5.4"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","21","27","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/recommended/400250/","EdenStarGazer","EdenStarGazer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/","429 products in account","This game is not much. I say that because I am trying to be positive lol. (It is instead of it's not.) Ok, let me explain by telling you what it is not. Remember "Playstation Home?" It's not that. Or, Second Life? It's not that either. Paradise Island has taken one tiny element of those games and brought it into the VR age; exploration of a virtual "unreal" estate. It works from a technical standpoint, despite the few errors I see in technical glitches.\n\nRemember those shoebox theatres we made as kids, (if you were born in another milenia) where you made a long scrolled storyboard filmstrip of crayon art on butcher paper and inserted it into the shoebox on dowels like a tv? Then you could wind the bottom dowel, scrolling the scene past the hole in the box so you were watching your own moving pictures. Then you could wind the top dowel to rewind the movie. Paradise Island is like that. The gamer, and I use that word loosely here, does not seem to actually interact with the environment. The scenes seem to scroll past you while you are standing still, rather. The only exception to this is that you see apples laying along the ground with these strange green auras, and seashells along the beach with the same auras. When you see those, click the "E" key and there you have a game. You, my friend, are collecting objects. And, if you collect 70 of each you will have a 100% game. That may be the only sane reason to spend more than 10 minutes in this game.\n\nNow, Let me tell you what I would like this game to be. It would be more engaging if you interacted with the scenes, without walking through objects. It would be even better if the people there were visible, instead of auras. And, what's with the aura thing? Why does everything have to have an aura? I thought someone was following me, because everytime I turned around an aura was in my face. Soon, I realized the aura was my own. Yes, I have an aura as well, and it moves more slowly than I do, so I see it when I circle around quickly.  So, you get the idea of how inane this game really is. Also, it would be great if you could talk, or chat with people you meet there... like a VR chat room. An MMO experience means interaction among gamers.\n\nThe only engaging thing I found was under the sea. There were a few fish and turtles. (It didn't seem to matter that I was underwater, since I apparantly didn't need to breathe.) Then, I walked around the island, and suddenly a cabin appeared before me, and then suddenly a pagoda. I walked through a fence. I closed the game, and realized I had a couple of achievements for picking up the apples. That's when I understood the whole point of the game. So, now when you see me playing this game again, you will know... Eden wants to 100% that game... all 70 seashells... all 70 apples. Poor Eden.\n\nAm I being harsh? Remember Second Life? I loved that. I should go play that again soon and may. Remember Playstation Home? I played that too much, and sadly spent too much money on virtual property on that game. I don't recommend you play that either, as it can be addictive and expensive. Now, if Paradise Island were either of those games, I'd probably have found another guilty pleasure. Lucky for me, this is not that.","January 17","false","8.3"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","0"

You can't talk or see anyone else playing, however I had a few times where there was a connection error and I was kicked back to the original spawn.\n\nThere is nothing to do in this game except for walk around the island, collect apples and shells. It would have been nice if there were some activities to do while exploring other than pressing E on every shell and apple you come across.\n\nThe achievements are buggy right now. I unlocked collecting 30 and 70 shells but the 30 shells won't unlock. The collect 60 and 70 apples won't unlock despite me collecting more than the required amount. The biggest problem is there is no counter in game to show you how many you have collected and achievements only pop up when you exit the game. There is no way to know how many you have unless you manually count as you go, and that doesn't help since achievements are buggy anyway.\n\nIf there was something do actually do or others to talk to, since this is labelled as an MMO, then I might be able to recommend this game. I'm not sure why is has multiplayer or MMO tags since while you are connected to a buggy/laggy server that will kick you back to your original spawn randomly, you will be completely alone while you explore the island.","January 13","false","1.8"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

I wish I could play more.\nUnfortunately I had to uninstall this, simply because I'm one of those people who get debilitating motion sickness with 1st-person perspective games and games that involve 3D panning/movement.\n\nThis had no bearing on my decision whether or not to recommend this game though.\n\nI hope the developer will consider making a 2D adventure version of this game, so I can play it - I'd love to do more exploring in such an environment. The visuals are most definitely pleasing - very relaxing and therapeutic, especially if you love water, swimming, diving, beaches, the seaside, ocean, etc etc.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIf you like tropical beaches and free roaming with no clear goals in sight, no harm giving this a try - the island is visually well-designed and the experience immersive.\n\nOther than that, the game has absolutely nothing going for it. The lack of instructions and inability to do much except walk around (I saw a sparkling shell and tried to pick it up, but guess what - no instructions for controls, so I couldn't figure out how to, despite pressing loads of keys and clicking my mouse countless times) was off-putting, not to mention disappointing.\n\nDisclaimer: Game played for free, many thanks to my dear friend Unpageable","May 27","false","0.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sellyme/recommended/400250/","sellyme","Sellyme","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sellyme/","776 products in account","The only gameplay (if you can call it that) in this product is picking up two different types of collectibles. There is absolutely no visible tracker of how many you've found (or even how many there are), and if you restart the game all of the collectibles will reappear without resetting the count of how many you've picked up.\n\nSo, the only semblance of gameplay is completely non-functional. Not a great start. How about the other features?\n\nPROS:\nThe textures are at least tolerable, although that shouldn't surprise anyone seeing as they're clearly default Unity assets.\nThe audio design is okay. There's a few sections of the island where the transition is a bit jarring, but I didn't have to mute the game.\nThe island is at least large enough that in the 37 minutes it took me to complete the game, I didn't actually completely memorise the map.\nCONS:\nThere are literally no options beyond the default Unity launcher. No audio options, no FoV, no mouse sensitivity, nothing.\nThe game runs awfully - I have an i7-4930K and Radeon HD 7970 and was getting fewer than 5 frames per second average at 360p.\nThe mouse sensitivity is unbearably low, to the point where I had to move my mouse a full two metres across my desk to do a half turn. There's no way to increase this.\nThe default walking speed is glacial. You can hold down shift to "run" (aka, walk at a normal speed), but doing so for the half an hour it takes to complete the game starts to actually become physically painful.\nThere's no gameplay. Yeah, the "collect stuff" mechanic is there, but I don't know why. What am I achieving here? The only "instructions" in the game are vague pretentious quotes presented on open books that have nothing to do with the game.\nThe draw distance is atrocious. I avoided a very large open area because I could clearly see that there was nothing there and wanted to avoid playing this "game" for any longer than I had to. It turns out that some collectibles were in that area that I didn't see, because the game hadn't bothered to render anything more than three metres from me.\nAccording to the game's hitboxes, the character you play as is a 50cm tall cube. Or at least, that's how it seemed from the environmental objects that I actually collided with, although it was hard to tell considering I clipped right through about 80% of them.\nThe cursor is not locked to the centre of screen. In a game with a first person camera, this is an unforgivable fault. At least a dozen times while playing this game I moused over the "show desktop" button or accidentally clicked on something on my second monitor, both of which froze the game for about thirty seconds.\nThe game claims to be an MMO, yet there's absolutely no multiplayer aspects. You can ostensibly see other players in the world as floating orbs, but you can't interact with them in any way. If seeing other people play the game independently counts as being an MMO, then watching someone play Minesweeper makes Minesweeper an MMO.\nTo my dismay, when I walked straight into the ocean and submerged myself underwater, I did not die. In fact, my character just continued to walk on the seabed. The ocean is apparently just for aesthetics.\nWhile in the ocean I found a large floating red orb about a metre below sea level. I still have no idea what that is, but I was unable to interact with it. It seems to just be a completely random asset that was accidentally put in to the game and never noticed.\nAs mentioned at the start of this review, there's no way of tracking the number of collectibles picked up. The only way of actually telling is to exit the game and wait for the Steam achievements to come up (because they don't proc while the game is running), but then the next time you launch the game, everything you picked up is back on the ground. You could theoretically get all achievements by picking up one shell and one apple 70 times each.\nThere's probably about twenty more negative points I could mention but I've already spent more time writing this review than the developer spent making this game, so I'm going to cut my losses while I still can.","April 2","false","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You walk to a zone, there's a music (that is kinda cool)... Then walk 1 step backward, and the music disappear. Same for the ocean waves, the sea grulls etc...\nOh, in the ocean there are no waves... Yeah, you listen waves sound, but you don't see them, nice ya?\n\nTo all of this, the controls sucks even more than the game.\nThe mouse accelartion ratio is like 1:15\n\nYou move your mose slowly = you don't move at all;\nYou move A BIT more faster = 720° MLG quickscopez bi**hes.\n\nThe physics...\nYou have like Moon gravity force.\n\nTry to throw yourself from a house. You will walk in the air and will land after 4-5 seconds.\n\nIf I would've improves this game, I would first of all delete it.\nThan start a new project on Unreal Engine 4 and do it the right way, add the possibility to seat on chairs and benches and to interact a bit more with objects, do a good job on scripting musics and video filters and make doors that the player can open to explore the house. And I would also add more things into the house and let the physics be real. Like, water drops are 2D and they make the sound, but on the water they fall into there's no effect at all.\n\nFor now this is a 1/10 review for me.\n","April 9","false","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

There are much worse games out there for a similar price, but also much better games as well. Paradise Island follows the story of the ghost of someone trapped on the island. In order to escape they must collect 70 apples and 70 shells, like some tedious Easter egg hunt. To be honest the being a ghost part is probably not true. It's just the fact that you can pass through most of the terrain, including trees, some walls and most ladders. Not to mention all of the wildlife seems to ignore you.\nGraphically the game is fairly beautiful. Golden sandy beaches, clear turquoise seas and lush green trees and plants. There are several landmarks dotted around the island too. Including a large Buddha statue, a small lighthouse and a few other places to note. Travelling from landmark to landmark can be fairly exciting and gives the game something of interest to aim for. But after a while you lose interest. The island, for the most part, looks very samey in places. The same rock formations dot opposite ends of the coast, along with several small boats washed up on the shore. Pointless books sit scattered around the island on pedestals talking about some pointless nonsense that, to be quite honest, no one really cares about.\nFor the most part Paradise is an interesting, if not short lived, walking sim. While collecting the shells and apples dotted around can be fairly exciting, it does get boring very quickly. To be honest, if you want a decent walking sim with a generous amount of freedom, then I'd go for something else. The vanishing of Ethan Carter is a fairly good example, or if you want a game set on island as well, then Salt is a better option.\nWith a cheap price tag, Paradise Island is worth a go, even for a few minutes, but if you want something that lasts longer, and is more enjoyable I suggest looking elsewhere.

More like nNO\n\nOk, I understand that this game is a "journey to find your inner self" kind of game, but unless your inner self is an apple or a seashell, you're not going to get much from it. It's not really professionally made: no menu, bad window ratio, controls/mouse is kind of jerky, and pressing esc crashes the game. There are no objectives and no way to interact or "connect" with the players (basically other orbs of light, but you won't see them anyways 'cause they're idling for cards). Although I got to admit, the island is quite pretty, albeit kind of small.\nSome people complained about not having any audio. Audio, for me, was able to work, but usually it was only the minimal nature-y sound effects with an occasional music clip that just plays randomly which I found to be sort of unnerving. Honestly, I think this game has a lot of potential, but it's just not finished. There are fish in the waters and buildings all over the island, but the only two things you can actually pick up/interact with are shells and apples (which will just spawn back to their original positions after a while). You can't even open doors. Also, you move really slowly, jump really slowly, and fall really slowly (I basically was just holding shift down the entire time while I was scouting for shells).\n\nThere are 15 cards. Took me 4.7 hours to get 8 of them.\nAchievements are easy, if you're into that sort of thing.","February 29","false","4.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","0"

Pretty standard and this intuitive.\n\nWhile wandering around you may interact with "E", picking up apples and seashells for quick and trouble-free achievements.\n\nExit using "ESC", upon which any achievements you have acquired will be registered.\n\nYou may also encounter glowing souls which keep moving around. These are supposedly other players, though you cannot interact with them in any way.\n\nWhile you are missing the ability to swim, somehow you are able to walk underwater, which reveals a whole new flora and fauna and interesting reflections.\n\nMost of the music used fits the area in which it is played quite well, though there were two cases in which the new pieces were simply too loud in comparison to the ones before that.\n\nAll in all (and if you cut out the inner soul stuff) this game delivers what it promises, so I can easily recommend it to those simply interested in kicking back and touring new digital areas.\n\nPlease note that even on the setting "fastest" I experienced quite the bit of lag.

It focuses a lot on exploration and gives you a lot of locations to explore but nothing to explore inside of those locations. For example I walked around and arrived at this Asian temple and music started to play. It was very interesting and I walked inside. I read some quotes and that was really all I could do there. It knew how to hype me up yet didnt give me anything to be hyped about.\n\nNow for the mmo part in the game, there is none. There are blue orbs flying around which are other people exploring but there is no way to contact them. I think the MMO part in the game is false and should either be completely removed or make it possible to communicate between other users.\n\nThe visuals and sounds in this game are good, not amazing but good. You have to keep in mind that its not a triple A game by a big publisher but an indie game. Therefore I think that they or he did a great job on the visuals and soundtrack.\n\nHonestly in my opinion I think its a fun game with a few flaws that can easily be fixed by putting a little more effort into the game.\n","March 18","true","0.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","4"

Other reviewers describe this island as "vast", I would describe it as "tiny", not even a speck on the map, I went around the whole thing in about four minuts. Does it have breathtaking graphics? Ehh, maybe in a circa-2010 game engine kind of way, certainly nothing more than what you see in the images. Is it tranquil? Interesting? Getting there. What it needs is more of these pages, with more text, and the ability to actually sit, or perhaps to fly, but most importantly considering it installs itself as an "MMO", it needs the ability to interact with other players beyond just seeing them.

I happened upon a bright blue and white orb. This orb, this essence, represented another being in this tranquil place. It seemingly hovered happily, playfully, almost joyfully in front of me. It bounced up and down as in acknowledgement of my presence. It moved away some distance and I chased it not knowing why. It stopped abruptly and I felt its gaze upon me once more. Instinctively, I knew what I must do - KILL IT! Slowly, I began circling it, in my ears unplayed music Stravinsky The Rite of Spring, my blood pumping I circled faster. I was Spock and this orb was Kirk - this was to be a battle to the death! Then it blinked out of existence.  My blood lust unquenched - I was sad.\n\nPretty graphics, charming life affirming quotes and.. well, that is pretty much it.\nThis 'game' has a way to go yet, but it does seem the developer is listening to feedback and adding more content.\n\nI got my copy free, one of thousands given away. With the price under £1, often heavily discounted and the promise of further work being done - I am happy to recommend for a look-see.","February 8","true","4.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brutalboris/recommended/400250/","brutalboris","BrutalBoris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brutalboris/","69 products in account","I'm going to give this a thumbs up for now simply because I read the info around the game before playing and have a clear exectation of what the game currently has available.  First off, it's classified as an MMO but currently you see other blue "souls"/orbs in the game but there is no interaction in the game really.  You are a blue orb that floats around the environment and so far I've found there are books that have quotes from Tom Stoppard, Martin Luther King Jr., and maybe some Zen type quotes/thoughts.\n\nI chatted with the lead developer and he has more plans to add stuff, maybe crafting, etc. but for now you can only pick up some items like shells and apples, etc.  There currently appears to be no inventory access however.  It is really a cool environment and the music isn't too bad.  It honestly reminds me of Hawaii, calm, serene, and peaceful.\n\nBecause I knew the current state and that the dev is adding more features and functionality in the future I will give this a 7/10 for what my current expectations were.  You may find yourself wanting to find all the key locations and may sink a lot of time in just moving around the island.\n\nPros: Serene, calm environment with music and sounds to relax.  You can "collect" shells, read books that are on the paths (and do like I did and google/research where they came from), see the "sites", get caught up in wanting to "just find one more place and see what's "over there". Graphics are pretty cool, shadows are neat, fish and environment are pretty good.\n\nCons: Had a few graphics crashes on a really high end video card/gaming system. Had to reduce to "fast" instead of "fastest" for graphics. Need inventory access, maybe crafting.  You have to start back at the same spot every time you log in, not where you left off.  I got stuck trying to go into a few of the treehouses/shacks.  No chat  or interactions with others.\n\nIf you are looking for a highly interactive game this is not it (yet). If you are looking for a lot of interaction, crafting, inventory, etc. this is not it (yet).  If you like those games that kind of catch you and draw you in to keep going and trying to just see what's around the next corner, while being calming and relaxing, this is the game you want.  If you like researching then things you find in game this is also a good thing for you to experience in this game.\n\n","January 1","true","9.4"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","7","18","0","0"

Given the very low price and the fact that it comes with Steam trading cards, it's worth picking up even if you don't plan on playing it.\n\nThat said, it has a lot of potential. The world looks nice, though I'm sure it'll be expanded and improved upon. At the moment, you can walk/run around it, but I couldn't interact with any objects, jump, or adjust settings.\n\nThere were places I got "stuck" because I could step down into them but I could not get back out or move around it since there was no jumping possible.\n\nSuggested changes/improvements:\n\nExpand the world\nEnable interaction with objects in the game world\nAllow users to adjust the mouse sensitivity (the sensitivity is MUCH lower than most gamers would like)\nEnable jumping/firing/action keys\nLock the cursor into the window\nMaybe allow players to interact with one another in some way to make it more "real" and personal than just seeing another player's soul\nAllow an in-game menu, rather than the Escape key automatically kicking you out of the game\n\nAll in all, it needs quite a bit of work but is definitely worth picking up if you can get it cheaply. I will probably play it a lot more once the developers polish it more and add in some of those features I listed or put more in the game to do. Go ahead and get it while it's cheap. I'm sure if they put a lot more into the game it won't be under a dollar.","January 3","true","7.6"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

It is very frusterating getting stuck in rocks and inside of buildings and having to restart the game to get out, but honestly, if you don't go looking for bugs you won't find too many of them. All in all, this game actually was very pleasant and relieved a lot of stress from my day/week. With a little more polishing this could be a fun thing to turn to if I am feeling overwhelmed in life. Also it's like a dollar, and if you really hate it you can return it, so I say why not give it a go? I will hold on to this and see where the (very regular) updates take it.

The idea of this game is to relax and just explore the Island that you are in. The multiplayer side isn't all that great, but this game really relies on graphics and the music/sounds to make you like this game. If you don't like games with no real objective you may not like this game. I really enjoyed this game.\n\nGame PlayThis game hasn't got all that much to talk about when it comes to the game play side. There are very few objectives/goals for you to do, but the game makes up for it with a nice over world to explore. There is a lot of places to explore and discover as you explore this very nice looking Island. There are few books that have some nice quotes that really set the mood of the game as well which compliments the graphics of this game and the atmospheric music. The rendering of the game isn't too great. You have to be pretty close to entities to make them appear, not much of a problem but just kinda annoying sometimes. This game really makes up for everything with it's very large over world to explore, this keeps you playing searching for more things to discover while keeping you relaxed throughout the entire experience. For me this is basically a stress relief of a game, it really helps me relax when I am stressed or angry, which really helps me get through my day and puts me in a good mood.\nScore (Out of 10): 8 - Very nice walking experience, would like some more objectives to do that doesn't stress you out. This could prolong the game play and keep me interested to play it in longer sessions.\n\nGraphics/Art StyleThe graphics of this game are beautiful. It really helps set the mood along with all of the nice atmospheric music that comes along with it. It's really good for a single indie developer to put so much detail in the game on his own, some of places on the island are really nicely detailed when you find them. With the graphics and game play together it really suits the game well to be a relaxing walking simulator.\nScore (Out of 10): 10 - surprisingly good graphics for single Indie developer, nicely detailed that sets the relaxing tone of the game.\n\nMusic & SoundThis game has exceptional Music and Sound implemented into the game. There is only background music sometimes when you get to a certain area and then it just dies down and you can hear all the other sounds of the game. This works well, but sometimes I was really wanting the background music to come back up so that I could relax more. The developer worked well with the sounds of the birds and waterfalls when you get near to them. Really well done.\nScore (Out of 10): 9 - Really nice atmospheric music and sounds, maybe keep on the background music constantly on a low volume.\n\nConclusionI would defiantly recommend this game to people who enjoy playing games with no real objective, and just to walk around and explore the area to get into a relaxing state. It really has helped me through some days when I was stressed or angry, it calmed me down and helped me get through my day.\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Lot's O Giveaway's curator group here.","February 13","true","7.8"," 12 of 29 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","12","29","0","0"

I know they do read reviews and change stuff, because the game used to be literally unplayable because of the low mouse sensitivity (you had to drag your mouse across the mousepad 4 times just zu turn around ever so slightly) and they fixed that, it's now definitely playable.\n\nIt's basically a walking simulator. It already looks quite nice (playing on highest settings), but they *need* to add more details, more detailed textures. Especially the wood textures look like brown plastic. They need to do something about that. The sand looks good, the fish are really pretty. There are too many tree-clones, there should be more diversity. Maybe also add some land animals (like some bunnies maybe, lizards, some bees and butterflies?)...\n\nThe soundscapes are nice, but there are areas in the game that are completely silent and that's something they need to change as well.\n\nI enjoyed walking around and discovering all the little 'books' on the island (even if some of the quotes were a little 'meh'...).\n\nI understand that this is supposed to be a walking simulator, but please give us something to interact with. Anything. Let us interact with the other souls on the island, or add a little minigame in the game (like some tables where you can sit down and play a game of cards or a tabletop game with the other souls?). The game needs *some* purpose.\n\nSo, please keep on updating this and add new things, and I will come back to check them out. :)\n\nUPDATE 06.01.2016:\n\nThe devs do listen to the community, they have added animals and you can now collect stuff (apples and shells) around the island and in the ocean. :) I like.","January 2","true","7.4"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","0"

This isn't a "game" in the traditional sense nor is it what is commonly called a walking simulator as there is no storyline. It is more of a Zen/meditation experience to use to relax along with some wisdom quotes on books (Buddhist I assume) and is (in my opinion) well worth the 50 cents I paid for it on sale. I think it'll look really good on the Oculus Rift whenever I get one of those.\n\nBut it is definitely unfinished:\nYou can get stuck in certain areas and can't get out since you can't jump\nYou can collect shells and apples, but there is nothing to do with them afterwards (that I've found)\nYou get disconnected from the server every few minutes, which puts you back in the beginning. It seems like there should be some sort of save that remembers the last place you where at and put you back there when you restart the game\nYou can't interact with items. I.e. you can't "sit" in a chair (of couse you are some kind of energy ball so maybe that wouldn't make much sense anyways, but you get the idea)\nThis looks like it would be a great crowd project and I encourage the developers to open it up to people for development. To maintain the Zen experience, you can't just make it "real-time" open design though since people would ruin it (a la Second Life), but maybe have a way for people to design and submit additional pieces of island to you and then you can review them and integrate the worthy ones. Maybe also add the ability of users to play their own music while "playing".\n\nAnd while I'm normally not a fan of idiot checks, PLEASE add a "are you sure you want to exit" dialog if you keep the Escape key as the way to quit since in a lot of games, that button acts as a pause button and it's really annoying when I try to pause the game with Escape and it exits (and then of course when I start it back up, I'm back at the beginning).  ;-)","December 29, 2015","true","1.1"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

HOWEVER, you are paying for a game that is 80p. If the game was expensive the developers would have been funded to enhance the graphics of the game. Please remember this is not Battlefront 3 with top quality graphics or the newest DICE engine. This is using a simple engine, and it is using it quite well.\n\nThe 3D world of Paradise Island comes to life in a realistic way, which is nice.\n\n\nI liked it.\n\nOverall Score: 6 / 10\n\n-\nEDIT: The game is also being updated regularly.","January 4","true","7.0"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

It's also not much of a MMO.\nWhy? It's missing some of the main aspects that MAKE a MMO a.. well... MMO.\n\n1. This game is not listed as early access, as it really should be. It doesn't even have a main menu.\n2. You are auto-joined into servers, don't get to pick, don't get to choose, don't get to nothing.\n3. You don't know who you're playing with. You see players as blue wisps, that it.\n\nThis is basically a walking simulator, that CAN help you relax with the sounds and music. That's really all to it, including picking up some shells and apples here and there for you achievement hunters.\n\nWhen I came across the reddit post and looked up the store page, I saw major potential in this game. I really did, although the developer had a miss.\nAs mentioned above, this game should really be early access as development continues.\n\nWhat I like about the game.\n\n* The game sounds are really good for a game at this "state"\n* Trading Cards! Coming in with a set of 15 and a drop cap of 8\n* Achievements, well, sorta.\n\nWhat I don't like.\n\n* No main menu\n* Achievements not registering/lack of\n* Lack of variety\n* Somewhat misleading title\n* Lack of Content\n\nWhat it NEEDS.\n(In order of impotence)\n\n*Main Menu - With Single/Multiplayer, Settings, Quit button, etc.\n*Something that keeps players coming back. ("Addicting" Content)\n*More Content\n*Multiplayer overhaul (Server selection, profile names, etc.)\n*More Achievements\n\nRegarding the "bribe drama" going on. A cripe ton of people already have the game and they've left reviews, but not constructive reviews. When I received the key I was told to leave a constructive positive review. As mentioned before, this had potential but it was a miss. In that case I will not be leaving a positive review, but rather a negative constructive review. I expect you to implement most of these, dev.\n\nTL;DR\nMissed Potential, Can be a relaxing walking simulator.\n\n\nGood day, Gentlemen\n\n~Hi5TBone","January 9","false","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The island contains a variety of setpieces ranging from a large Buddha statue to a tree house to a playground in an orchard to beach bungalos... lots of things that should be tons of fun.  However, outside of collecting sea shells and apples, the game lacks any kind of interactivity (the treehouse is inaccessible because you clip through the ladder, what a rip).  Also, the visuals are really somewhat subpar, with 3d models that come across as lazily crafted and certainly lazily textured.  The movement of the player is also really floaty and annoying in that subtle way that never allows you to get used to it.  The MMO aspect adds literally nothing to the gameplay, interactivity, or experience at all.\n\nNot to mention that the game world is scattered with these books which apparently only contain one "philosophical" quote each.  In a somewhat hamfisted attempt to give the game some sort of intellectual or faux zen aspects, the most shallow guru quotes (which can only be mistaken as deep by college freshmen stoners) are tossed into random places, putting the finishing touch on this game's status as an absolute mess of random assets thrown together with no thought.\n\nAll in all, the game feels like a collection of half baked ideas, lazy execution, and lack of direction that isn't really meant for anyone.  I usually enjoy laid back games where I can just absorb the scenery, but this was just a huge mess.\n\nDo not buy.","April 7","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Upon entering the game I found that I could only look around.  The strange blue wisp I spawned as could only float in place and watch as my computer toiled away, running the biggest waste of $0.79 that I have ever had the misfortune of playing.  Do not play this game if you like good graphics, decent gameplay, or doing things that are fun.  It is truly the closest thing to purgatory on this miserable side of death.

You can check out stuff under water, explore wherever you want, and just relax.

Secondly, this game (or should I say experience?) is quite nice. If you can get over the texture pop-ups, bad optimization or the fact that this game is far from finished.\n\nI can understand where the designer got his idea from, he wanted to emulate the experience you will have with indie darling Dear Esther, which is a worthwhile goal but thus far badly conceived.\n\nA few feedback points for the creator of this game:\n1. If you do not feel that this game is ready, set it into alpha mode.\n2. The Steam community can be a fickle flame, but they are also willing to give you tons of feedback and make your product better.\n3. If this all was just a ruse to get use shelf out 99 cents, then I congratulate you on your well played scheme. But I'm guessing to the extent of your design you just wanted to create something very beautiful.\n\nSo, I'm going to recommend this game but there is a lot to be learned for the developers (and the Steam client base) for future games or sequels or updates. So do not buy it if you want a badly optimised game, do buy it if you can look past that.\n\nI hope the people behind this experience will take it to heart and go with it.","January 26","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The island contains a variety of setpieces ranging from a large Buddha statue to a tree house to a playground in an orchard to beach bungalos... lots of things that should be tons of fun.  However, outside of collecting sea shells and apples, the game lacks any kind of interactivity (the treehouse is inaccessible because you clip through the ladder, what a rip).  Also, the visuals are really somewhat subpar, with 3d models that come across as lazily crafted and certainly lazily textured.  The movement of the player is also really floaty and annoying in that subtle way that never allows you to get used to it.  The MMO aspect adds literally nothing to the gameplay, interactivity, or experience at all.\n\nNot to mention that the game world is scattered with these books which apparently only contain one "philosophical" quote each.  In a somewhat hamfisted attempt to give the game some sort of intellectual or faux zen aspects, the most shallow guru quotes (which can only be mistaken as deep by college freshmen stoners) are tossed into random places, putting the finishing touch on this game's status as an absolute mess of random assets thrown together with no thought.\n\nAll in all, the game feels like a collection of half baked ideas, lazy execution, and lack of direction that isn't really meant for anyone.  I usually enjoy laid back games where I can just absorb the scenery, but this was just a huge mess.\n\nDo not buy.","April 7","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've tried to break it down into a pro/con list.\n\nPROS:\n+Good graphics - Not the best, but they're decent enough.\n+High FPS - Runs pretty well, even on high settings.\n+Huge map - There's lots of places to explore.\n+Simple to understand - It's not complicated at all.\n\nUnfortunately, this is the extent of the positive things I can say about this. Graphics and performance can only get you so far.\n\nCONS:\n-No story - You're given no story or explanation as to why you're here and what you're supposed to do. If I hadn't read the achievements before playing the game, I wouldn't have had a clue what I was meant to do. All that you're given are a few books with cryptic quotes about happiness in them.\n-Lack of objective - The only task you're given in this game is to collect seashells and apples. There's no real reason behind it and it doesn't feel meaningful in any way. It's not at all fun and gets very boring after about 5 minutes.\n-World is too big - There are all sorts of structures on and around the island, but they're often blocked off by invisible walls and there's sadly no incentive to explore them at all. Instead, you're encouraged to stick close to the water and trees so you can get apples and shells. This wouldn't be so bad if the island wasn't HUGE. It takes ages to navigate the whole thing looking for tiny little objects.\n-Glitchy - I encountered lots of bugs and graphical glitches in this game. One time when I booted it up, the map completely failed to load and I was just stuck in a void. Another time, I got stuck in some rocks underwater. It's frankly shameful.\n-Bad controls - The mouse sensitivity is very high and the controls aren't very intuitive. To collect objects, you press the E key instead of the mouse like a sensible person would expect. You can't really tell where your cursor is because there's no crosshair and you need to have your mouse over an object to collect it. There's no way of changing the controls or editing the mouse sensitivity because when you press escape, the game just closes.\n-Easy - You can complete this game in 30 minutes-an hour very easily. There's no challenge involved at all.\n\nThis game is hardly even a game. It's the kind of thing you would expect in a tech demo, not a full game that costs 99 cents. Don't waste money and disk space on this!","June 3","false","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
