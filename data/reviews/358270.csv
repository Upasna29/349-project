You have a selection from 3 random races each with its own difficulty and money/ladder points rewards - there is a limited time to sign up to a race and soon you'll be watching it closely for which driver will sign up where so that you may jump into a more difficult race and win it due to weaker competition and be showered with the rewards.\n\nWith the top down racing there are several mechanics that make it so much more interesting.\nGuns! (duh!)\nPowerups - repairs, boosts, ammunition, drugs, etc.\nBlack market - You can buy mines, sabotages, rocket fuel and spikes for your bumper.\nSponsorship bonuses - Rewards for taking minimal damage, killing everyone or winning 3 times in a row.\nAssasination/Steroids objectives - sometimes offered by a shady figure with reprecussions if you fail.\nWin the race by racing or eliminating competition.\nThe menu UI and graphics are very well made, nowhere to get lost and they're... pretty.\n\nMusic is amazing, have the OST in my car - it's that good. No idea how much bias does my nostalgia bring, but if you can live with the pixely graphics in races I strongly recommend giving it a try. Heck, there is a demo version if you'd want to try before you buy.","October 9, 2015","true","3.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

If you played it and liked it back in the day, you'll probably still enjoy it. Probably less to offer you if you're someone who doesn't already know it from previous experience. I happen to still love it, though it's not aged as well as I thought, with vehicle physics that feel a bit dated compared to newer top-down racers. It is, like, 20 years old now though.

He's one of the selectable drivers in this game and comes with his classic "Hail to the king, baby" lines when he comes in first.\n\nThis is worth every penny.

It's actually not too low res and pixellated in comparison to other games from around the same time.\n+ The sound effects are okay. One or two of the music tracks are good.\n+ There's quite a good range of variety in the environments that you race in. The tracks are quite well designed and fun to race in.\n+ The occasional challenge which you are offered (collect some drugs while racing, destroy another car) is an interesting feature and makes the gameplay a little more interesting. You can also win by destroying the other cars, which is fun too.\n+ The speed at which the cars travel is well done and it feels like you're actually racing, unlike a lot of other racing games.\n+ It runs fine on my windows 7 64 bit OS, with no problems and not too many glitches in game.\n\n\nNegatives\n- The game is very grindy. Once you get past the first few races, you have to keep repeating the same few tracks over and over again until you get enough money to actually upgrade to a newer car or upgrade parts of your current car. It seems like you only feel a sense of progression three times in the game, which is when you advance to the next set of tracks. (There are three sets of around 5 tracks, arranged by difficulty).\n\nTo put this into perspective, it takes around 3 races where you finish 1st each time to unlock an upgrade for your car. Depending on which car you have, there are anywhere from around 4 to 9 or 10 upgrades for some of the later cars. It takes a long time to upgrade your car, and it doesn't really feel like a lot is happening in the meantime.\n\n- The collision detection is pretty bad, even for a game made in 1996. This is the sort of collision detection that GTA 1 & 2 had, where if your car slightly collides with a wall, then your car will come to a complete stop. It's like that, except that it seemed to happen to me in almost every single race, and there are many tiny objects such as lamp posts which you can collide with and they will bring your car to a complete halt. It doesn't help that the car doesn't really move backwards very well so i found myself driving forward until the car was unjammed from the wall, which damages your car quite badly.\n\n- The AI opponents are annoying when they use mines as they will always suddenly drop a mine if you happen to be right behind them. This feels pretty cheap and it's annoying because there's a lot of situations in the game where you can't help but be right behind an AI car.\n\n- The armour upgrades which you can apply to your car don't feel like it changes anything. You still lose armour really quickly even with the highest upgrade of armour.\n\n- The save function doesn't seem to work, you have to manually save. The game doesn't tell you this and it never once saved the game, so i actually ran out of money when i was close to the end of the game and lost the game. I would have had to start from the beginning again, however it doesn't feel like it would be worth it since i was close to the end.\n\n- There's no multiplayer mode, so this is only for singleplayer. The campaign only lasts for around 4-5 hours, which would make it only just worth value for money at the full price.\n\n\nI had heard a lot of good things about this game, but to me this seems like nostalgia had a big impact on this. By today's standards for racing games, it's still a decent racing game, especially compared to some games which are just broken and not very well made. However the gameplay feels shallow and not very in-depth and it has some problems with being frustrating, especially when your car is constantly getting stuck.\nIt's still fairly fun to play and definitely one of the better racing games on steam, but it still seems like it would have been a fairly average game even in 1996. I'd say it might be worth it in a sale though.\n","April 4","false","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've re-played the DOS original multiple times on hardest difficulty, but never had to struggle (reload my save) this much to make progress.\n\nI could never get first place, and I'd regularly end up fourth unless something unusual happened. After I bought the middle-tier car, the game suddenly became impossible, because enemies' cars suddenly improved too, and repair costs were eating all my winnings. I had to reload 10 times to get lucky enough to come out of a race with a net positive income. I had to resort to the exploit where you enter the $750 race, outrun the slow opponents, then get a $3000 'not a scratch' reward.\n\nThe AI's unbalanced. They only use turbo to outrun _me_, and they only lay mines when things are directly behind them. Often the opponents I face consist of two fast cars that don't fight each other, and one car slightly faster that me that uses mines to stop me - a really frustrating setup. They also seem to have armor upgraded to max, since nothing ever dies unless me and another car bring mines. The AI can bug out and get stuck in a wall while trying to avoid a mine, and if it happens to get unstuck, it will rush ahead with a seemingly unlimited speed boost.\n\nOh, and collisions are broken too. You bounce off everything, but the enemy cars don't. This means that getting past an equally-fast car is impossible, since they can just poke you slightly to make you veer 90 degrees off course and into a wall. This happens constantly, even when I drive a Deliverator.","December 9, 2015","false","4.5"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","5","13","0","8"
