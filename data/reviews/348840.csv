The game is a well balanced strategy board game with nice mechanics that work very well and jelly aliens with a good AI.\nUfho2 delivers a surprisingly great amount of contents: from the story mode to the different characters and the gameplay modifiers.\nI strongly advise to play it against other (human or alien) players because it's how the game is meant to be played.\n\nDISCLOUSURE: I personally know one of the developers.","June 3, 2015","true","1.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

From the story to the puzzles, this game is very, very well made. I am not very good at strategy games, but I really enjoy playing this.\nhttps://youtu.be/YH7jWuBNaFo","November 6, 2015","true","0.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
