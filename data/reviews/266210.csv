(If you're the sort that likes to go "tl;dr" then just scroll to the bottom, but I mean, then why are you even reading reviews to begin with?)\n\nI picked this game up for <$0.60 when it was sale during the summer. I have to say, those were the best $0.60 I have ever spent. One Way Heroics doesn't appeal to you with stunning graphics, rich storytelling, or intricate gameplay. Instead, it is more retro gaming, silly short tales, and an easy to pick-up set of controls. Now you might be wondering, why would I want something like that? Arguably everything but simplicity of the controls could be considered negative or at least niche.  One Way Heroics doesn't offer high spec gaming while emptying your wallet - what you're buying is meaningless fun and entertainment.\n\nWhen I first opened this game and started an adventure, I found myself with my silly little 2D character talking to a "Naughty King Victor" about the darkness at the left of my screen that would attempt to eat me until I killed the Demon Lord. Yes, clearly the storyline could use some work, but as I struggled to kill weak mobs and then stronger demons I found myself falling for this game. Everything was fairly straightforward and the desire to complete achievements, "save the world," and become a true hero compels you to play over and over again. It doesn't take several hours to do a run through like a quest in some RPG, just 30 minutes or so if you're short on time. Yet, you can play longer sessions that go for tens of hours depending completely on what you want to do and how much time you have - and those hours? They were some fun hours.\n\nI won't try to tell you that you'll be so entranced with One Way Heroics that you'll spend thousands of hours playing it - you probably won't. But it's easy to lose 10, 20, maybe even 100 hours of your life having fun by sending your hero towards the right of your screen. Was that worth my 60 cents while it was on sale? Definitely. Is it worth the full $3.49? Absolutely. Most of us play games to have fun - and One Way Heroics delivers.\n\ntl;dr?\n\nIf you're a hardcore gamer looking for a game with brilliant graphics and intricate/competitive gameplay to drop thousands of hours on, I think you're better off somewhere else.\nIf you're someone looking to spend 10-100 hours having fun in your spare time? Buy One Way Heroics.","October 29, 2014","true","51.5"," 251 of 271 people (93%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","93","251","271","10","2"

And with eight different classes to choose from, each actually requiring you to play differently (like, you wouldn't head in solo with a bard or keep your backside exposed with a hero) and a whole bunch of perks to apply and combine in whoknowshowmany ways, in addition with too many possible worlds to traverse and daily campaigns AND a bit of writing here and there that, while often rather generic, still has a couple bits that might make you go "oh, I didn't expect that" the first time you encounter them, you'll more likely than not spend a lot of time on this, provided you're into games experimenting with the roguelike concept.\n\nPresentation wise, it's a bit eh, though that's more of a personal issue. The music got annoying very quickly, so I turned it off. And the character portraits look rather amateurish and sketchy, but you don't see them too much, so they're easy to skim over.\n\nStill, if you got the cash to spare, give it a shot.","February 28, 2014","true","17.1"," 271 of 298 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","271","298","0","0"

In this game, you have to battle against the screen scrolling basically. If you get scrolled off the screen, you die. There are lots of interesting RPG elements at play here, such as different classes, leveling, skills, weapons, partners, and more. You can also save some items from your failed runs to use for the next run. The game is procedurally generated, and you can play worlds other people played by entering their world's seed. The game will also show you who was/is online on the same map you are. There are daily maps to explore and this game has a ton of depth you might not expect just looking at it. The expanded version is out on Playism and coming to Steam in the near future, but this version is well worth playing on its own.","April 27, 2015","true","57.0"," 156 of 165 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","156","165","3","0"

Once I figured it out though, I really enjoyed myself.  There are lots of unlockable classes, map modes, and difficulty levels.  Plus the world is randomly generated so the game can be different every time.  Since character stats and a limited number of items/weapons carry over between play throughs the game has good replay value and individual save slots add even more.\n\nInitially I didn't like the darkness/forced scrolling mechanic but it grew on me as I played.  With the darkness quickly following you, every action matters in combat and dungeon exploration so even though the game won’t move without you, there isn't much chance to catch your breath in these situations.  There is a genuine fear of trying to open a chest only to get trapped by the darkness that nicely complements the regular fear of death by monster.  The game is fun so despite bland visuals, if you watch game play with this information and it seems interesting or you enjoy rouge like games, then for well under $5 I can recommend Once Way Heroics.","February 28, 2014","true","46.6"," 268 of 313 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","268","313","0","6"

Whether for a 20 minute stroll or an epic 2-hour odyssey with perma-death waiting around every corner, this game aims to suit itself to multiple tastes.\n\nFinishing a game, whether winning or losing, awards points used to boost one's future playthroughs (with wins awarding more). Whether it be unlocking new perks or opening new slots in the Dimensional Vault to transfer items from one playthrough to the next, every run feels like it progresses the player. That being said, while there are technically save areas, losing concludes the run and records the player's performance right there - no going back to try and get more points, but it will allow you to conclude a run 'just for funsies'. Maniac Mode, the game's 'hardcore' setting also prevents players from importing items from previous games, though depositing new items is still possible. Save points and dimensional vaults make the game friendly for casual runs, but the true hero wins on Maniac Mode with no takesies backsies (the greatest scores are only counted upon no deaths).\n\nMore than that, the game is also surprisingly colorful. Dialogue and narrative is sparse, but sweet and entertaining. Furthermore, there are hidden secrets everywhere: the various characters you meet may have hidden dialogue, items may have unexpected purposes, and the non-restrictive nature of weapons gives a lot of freedom in designing 'builds'. There are even secret ways to win - it is recommended you do not go in with a guide, and simple explore yourself, as reading the wiki ruins a lot of the surprises this game has to offer (don't even look up those secret ways to win).\n\nThis reviewer's only criticism is that, after clocking a couple dozen hours, I'm ready for more! The weapons do resemble each other a bit too much, there's a hard limit on the available spells/abilities, dungeons resemble each other, and the charming character dialogues do eventually run dry.\n\nFor $3.50, this game was absolutely and totally worth it. It's creative, it's original, it's got high replayability, it suits people looking for various challenge levels, and it deserves to be recognized for what it is: a small but great roguelike RPG.","November 21, 2014","true","103.6"," 124 of 129 people (96%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","96","124","129","7","0"

Buy it. Longer version:\n\nPlot\n\nThe setting itself is quite simple. You are the hero, saving the world from darkness that's devouring everything. And to do that you have to kill Demon Lord, who's somewhere over there ------>\nThat's basically it, but there is so much more, if you care to search for it. Game is filled with alternative endings, hidden classes, party members... Well, you get the point. It actually makes me really sad that only 4,6% of players have invested time to complete the game in some other way, than beating the Demon Lord, as they are missing out on great plot, that's just hidden within seemingly generic RPG storyline.\n\nGameplay\n\nAs you embark to find the Demon Lord somewhere over that ------> way in randomly generated world, the said darkness is chasing you, destroying villages, killing the monsters and, most important of all, keeping you from stopping.  On your way you'll encounter multitude of different terrain types, villages, dungeons, enemies, merchants, friends, (friendly) ghosts of other players and so on. The further you go, the harder game becomes.\nCombat is very much in retro RPG style. You act ---> your party members act ----> enemies act. Extra agility can get you (or enemies) multiple moves in a row. There are status ailments, buffs, critical hits and plenty other things involved as well.\n\nDifficulty\n\nThe game lets you pick the difficulty setting from Walk in a park, Afternoon Stroll, Grueling Campaign or Inhumane odysseu, but even the Walk in a park isn't exactly a cakewalk for newcomer, while Inhumane Odysseu often catches even experienced players by surprise. You also choose your class, perks, and wether you'd like to start with some items from your previous misadventures, so game lets you have very much control over the level of difficulty.\n\nOverall\n\nI enjoyed this game immensely. When i got it for around 0,60€, I felt like I was robbing the developer, because this game is a rare gem that has great potential. So I was just happy to pay the 5-ish € for the new DLC, as I felt I had finally paid him back.\nThe game is addictive (albeit a bit repetitive), and easily triggers the "ONE MORE RUN" -feeling, that made me waste many evenings while trying to overcome hardest ordeals the game had to throw at me.","August 27, 2015","true","189.7"," 49 of 50 people (98%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","98","49","50","4","4"

There seem to be absolute tons of classes and perks, with a lot of strategy being offered after runs with "Hero Points" which allow you to expand your Dimensional Vault (to transfer powerful items between characters), unlock perks, and unlock classes.\n\nIt's certainly worth its price, almost no question about it.  There are a few small problems with the game, such as there being no mouse support whatsoever.  You can't click on anything, so you have to scroll using the keyboard.\n\nIt plays much more fluidly with a controller, so do yourself a favor and hook one up before starting the game.  I guarantee you you'll have more fun that way.\n\nIt's only 3 bucks right now and 3.50 at full price!  Go pick it up!  Play it!  Defeat the Demon Lord, hero!\n\nUPDATE:  Lately, I've been having a lot of crashing issues with the game, which is frustrating.  I'm not sure if it's a change in my system or just a bug that presents itself a couple hours into the game.

GOOD LUCK!\n\nSo begins your slow and painful descent into hell.\n\nAt the 1st gate of hell you pick your class, name, and perks (assuming you even have any). At first you'll wonder why you only get two classes, and thats because without any foundation the others will either be ♥♥♥♥ easy to play (IM LOOKING AT YOU PIRATE <3) or even harder to get going than your beginner classes (coughForceUsercough).\n\nAt the 2nd circle of hell you wander around on "Walk in the Park" mode (easy mode) and you get the gist of the game....while simultaneously wondering why the fabled final boss meets you at a predetermined point or why they even want to kill you (I still dont remember signing up for this ***....Was I Voluntold?). You also realize multiplayer is a lie, as ghosts of people who may have died in that world you signed up to plop into dont seriously help when you're being swarmed by Zubats when night falls on the open plains.\n\nAt the 3rd circle of hell you die because an imp threw a rock too hard at your skull....or a skeleton was spawned in and one shot you with its nifty sword....or you got trapped in the damn DESERT and harpies ended up swarming your soon-to-be carcass. You die, get a crappy score, get some really lame advice and useless critiques from Navi the Fairy, maybe even some halfway tips, and you start over because you refuse to take your beating lying down.\n\nAt the 4th circle of hell you beat the game once and get an ending that leaves too many things open. So you start again, probably on a higher difficulty because you havent learned your lesson from being nearly incinerated and eaten by wild dingos. This was a mistake, as now you have to deal with your old AND new ♥♥♥♥ being torn asunder because enemies are hitting like speeding bullet trains and you just left the Shire.\n\nAt the 5th circle of hell you start getting more endings because you keep beating the game, but now with some of those elusive bonus companions at your side. You meet Elodie after you beat Long Live the Queen (she clearly took nothing but combat classes this time), Azir-Finally here-Emperor Pigeon, Alphonse Elric, an edgy Male Gunner from DFO, a defenseless Loli, a nurse that's crying because you chewed her out for being a dog girl instead of a cat girl, and money grubbing panty mercenary who doesnt actually care about panties. Their endings flesh out their characters, but you still dont know what the hell is going on (or why the left side of the screen continues to devour the game like its stocking up for hibernation every time you start the game again).\n\nAt the 6th circle of hell you decide to just ignore the final boss and journey until the game makes you stop. This results in many a death and many late nights wondering why the ♥♥♥♥ you bought this game. Eventually you reach the end of the world (cause the world really is flat guys, school lied to you) and you finally understand that this game is just dicking with you over and over until you get it right.\n\nAt the 7th circle of hell you attempt to fix the left side of the screen, only to be eaten and or incinerated by it......now everything becomes clear to you and you know what you need to do.\n\nAt the 8th circle of hell you get some Cheesy Puffs, some Dew, and prepare your quad-anuses (btw you should have a minimum of 4 now) for tons of save scumming because of all of the save crystals you hoarded in your Dimensional Vault between worlds; clears or deaths. You finally beat the game and you throw yourself into the next circle of hell because nothing matters anymore.\n\nAt the 9th circle of hell you melt your computer because now you have to buy the DLC and experiance being Anakin Skywalker, Naruto, and some random tourist to Disney World to get all the achievements in the game.\nTime and time again you are going to want to chuck your keyboard/laptop wondering what new ways the game can come up with to cheapshot you and why you just took 600 damage because a bear decided to ♥♥♥♥ your ♥♥♥♥ up. This game (on higher difficulties) will tear you a new one and laugh as you try to tape your ♥♥♥♥ back together. On lower difficulties.....itll only happen 1 or 2 times because you'll pick up enough situational awareness to not get your eyes torn out of their sockets while you were exploring or trying to reach that one item tucked inbetween 30 tiles of mountain when all you know how to do is dash around like Sanic the ♥♥♥♥ing Hedgehog, trying to figure out how many items you can get before the left side of the screen eats you again.. Eventually you realize that you spent over 60 hours on a game where all you do is go right and try to survive when you suddenly dont get any food for 700 kms, or you get 4 consecutive corrupted lands and the ♥♥♥♥ing wolfmen and dragonkin swarm your position after all your weapons snap in half from all the fighting, or you blow up because you got set on fire and forgot to chuck that Elzite bomb you got 2 minutes into a run.\n\nAs you enter the Nth Circle of hell you realize that this was all only worth it if you can somehow make and achieve some sort of goal. You didnt, and you laugh as you realize this game has seared your soul and you will never be the same again.\n\n10/10 would auto-pilot into a lava tile again.","December 22, 2015","true","94.3"," 42 of 45 people (93%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","93","42","45","34","2"

I was pleasantly surprised.  The number of hours of gameplay to price has proven to be a solid purchase.\n\nI do not wish to oversell.  This is a solid game.  It has both pros and cons.  However, at this price point, it's a very high return on price.\n\nThe Pros are that it's a 2d sidescrolling, roguelike, fantasy style game that contains elements of progression post rogue-like death.  The unique aspect of the game is that the world is constantly scrolling to the right, and that if the hero is trapped on the far left of the screen, it's game over.  The game offers a few classes, with more unlocked as you continue to play through, and the ability to carry forward items (how many items can be expanded as well).  It's a typical 2d fantasy style throwback game.\n\nThe Cons of this game is the seemingly random difficulty at times.  Experiencing impossible creatures right outside the starting castle, and random event demons that you can't avoid.  This can be painful if you're trying to clear with a particular class and have dedicated some game clearing items towards your hero!

With a total of 8 classes (3 initial classes if my memory serves me right), it adds variety and replay value. Though some might see themselves inclined to a certain class since it is kind of OP. There are dirty humors within the dialogues too, though it's mild enough (unless you understand the references or the language).\nThe maps are limited, in which you will notice after a few hours. Though their sequences and contents may change depending on the dimension/campaign you will play through.\n\nGraphics: You'll mostly see pixel graphics in this game except when character dialogues pop up. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nAudio: The game showcases good, quality music. The tracks change depending on the area you are currently at which creates the mood of the setting.Even though I already have played the game repeatedly, the charm of it still lingers fresh to my ears. Sometimes, I find myself opening up the game and idling on the menu screen while listening to the opening/menu soundtrack.\n\nThe Verdict\nFor a game that packs a lot of replay value, comedic references, good RPG transition and a unique side-scrolling mechanic, it is already a great deal by itself even without discount. A must-buy for JRPG fans.\n\nIf you are asking if this game is worth its value, my answer is "Yes, it is worth it".\n\nIf you would like to see more recommended games that is worth the value you are paying, please visit my other reviews, or follow our curator group at Good Games Giveaways & Reviews.","March 18, 2015","true","21.1"," 55 of 66 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","55","66","5","0"

Perhaps many of you play roguelikes fanatically. I am not talking games like Binding of Isaac or FTL. I am talking ADOM, Nethack, Dungeon Crawl, those sorts.\n\nThose of you who do play those games may feel at times that their greatest strengths, their vast complexity and length, can often become overbearing and intimidating. By the end of any roguelike, the game becomes exhaustive. You've been at that game for days just for that one playthrough. And how many times did you have to die just to learn every special situation, and figure out every monster along the way to victory? These games require a lot of cognitive overhead and rote memorization.\n\n\n\nDoesn't it seem counterintuitive that I write a gripe about roguelikes in a recommendation for a roguelike? Yes, sure, but this is exactly what One Way Heroics tries to shy away from. It is a true roguelike, but it shies away from the issues I stated before. It plays fast and simple. You could expect to complete a full game within a few hours, and it provides enough of a challenge that it isn't a pushover for it. The wall of death to your left also rids you of the tedium of stashes and grinding.\n\nYour perspective of the game may be different from mine, but this is the most important aspect to me. This is how I sum up the game and why I play it.\n\nI play roguelikes for their nuanced and complex gameplay.\nI play One Way Heroics for its simplicity and short length per playthrough.","December 21, 2014","true","74.1"," 43 of 49 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","43","49","0","0"

This game is really, REALLY good. Especially for it's price! It's literally a steal! You may be thinking from the screenshots "Oh no. Another RPG Maker game." It isn't! This guy used his own engine that was sorta inspired off of RPG maker I believe. So lets get down to what the game actually is.\n\nYou are the hero. Or at least lets hope so! You can choose your class and perks and your gender. There are over 5 classes with their own set of weapons and skills and passive ability and you will be playing the game differently with each one. The game has an online element per sey. You can see in your top left corner who has died in the world you are in. As in players. So if you tell a friend the world you generated, the name of then they can play in the same world and you can see when they die or stuff.\n\nYou cannot see them in your game. Just see their status and their stats at the top left appearing every now and then.\n\nIn the game you will be running to the right a lot of the time from darkness.

Since the old days of Rogue and Hack, indie developers from all over have taken the basic ideas of roguelike games (procedurally developed worlds, blistering difficulty and permadeath, for example) and ran with it.\n\nOne Way Heroics literally "runs with it" by providing a game that forces you to keep running forward until you reach your destination: your final battle with the Demon Lord threatening the world. The parts of the world you leave behind are gradually consumed by a darkness that will devour you, too, if you wait too long or try to backtrack. So, in order to survive your encounter with the Demon Lord, you have to prepare yourself by gathering items and equipment and gaining levels on the way.\n\nReplayability is high due to the fact you can use Hero Points gained from a previous playthrough to help your next incarnation succeed better or faster than before. There's the Dimensional Vault, where you can leave your best items behind for the next play-through. You can also unlock new advantages or even new classes, for greater variety and strategy. You may also choose to run through the same world next time, rather than generating a new one, meaning that you can remember where towns, dungeons, merchants and particularly dangerous enemies are on the map, and approach or flee from them accordingly.\n\nThe game itself is a short one, which is good for those of us busy folks who want gaming in small bites. You can sit and finish a play-through in less than an hour. But there are multiple worlds (including multiplayer ones hosted online) and modes if you get bored of the standard game. I suspect there is more depth and content in this game than I have begun to scratch the surface of, because it requires many playthroughs to get to.\n\nWould definitely play again (and again)!","November 25, 2014","true","22.6"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","34","38","0","0"

A reason why a lot of RPGs are long and tedious. Most people who has a lot of stuff going on with their life doesn't have time to play RPGs straight in one sitting. Even though their playtime only consists of a few hours, it'll still take them days to weeks before they finish it. That's because they can't play in long durations.\n\nOne Way Heroics ignores this rule. It's a straightforward RPG with rouge-like elements. You don't need to explore hours in a dungeon. Here it'll only take you seconds. You don't need to grind. As levels are really not much of an importance later on. You don't need to get money, as you won't be spending a lot anyways. You don't need to look for secrets, as with each step you take the every growing darkness will engulf you if you don't keep moving forward(right).\n\nThe game is not real-time, not fast-paced, it is turn-based. Which means you have time to pause and think the actions you will make. And that is not noticeable until you play it. With each step you take at every turn, the whole world will move after you do. Enemies, allies, npcs, everything moves as you move. It uses a World Generator. Which means you can have different maps in every game you start. It generates random seeds at every reload of your save, with still keeping the same world and same map, but with different outcomes of enemies, treasures and such.\n\nIt is not repetitive as one might think. As with each new game, there will always be new stuff to unlock, and these stuff will make the game more enjoyable with each run.\n\nThe game is made from Wolf RPG Editor. The same game engine used on games like Mad Father and Densha. Which would explain the graphics. Not much of a complaint there since I am rather retro, I don't know about modern gamers though.\n\nUpdate: The developer(s) of this game was also the creator(s) of the game engine. No wonder he/she/they used it instead of other ones like RPG Maker or etc. Quite fascinating.\n\nVery recommended to people who likes old-school RPGs and/or doesn't have a lot of time to play lengthy RPGs.\n\nA very simple RPG that will only take you minutes to finish. And with each new game, it gets more exciting and enjoyable.","March 5, 2014","true","29.7"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

You play an adventurer because excuse plot and you need to save the world, just like in Half-Life 3.\nDarkness is coming from the left and so the only thing you can do is go right.\n\nIt's a 2D Final Fantasy 13 in that sense but the graphics and plot development here is waaay better.\nSquare Enix really needs to take lessons from Sony and make another Final Fantasy X Sonic game.\n\nPick up loot, kill wild monsters, avoid getting trapped against walls or else it will be game over.\nIf you don't play rogue games often however expect to die, a lot! Hunger will cripple you, monsters will one shot kill you, walls and other obstacles will always seem to get in the way at the worst possible time, and thieves will spawn while you are already holding on for dear life.\n\nDespite the above however the game is not about cheap deaths! This is refreshing because Rogue like games usually go the 'uber hard' route by killing you for trivial stuff. You know the kind, you didn't drink enough water so died. You didn't see the hidden pit of instant death so you fell in it and died. This game has none of those, if you died, it was your fault and you can learn something from every death. This means the game is more about learning than it is about gruelling difficulty which is what makes it so much fun.\n\nEnjoy the game and watch out for those treasure chests in dungeons, they'll get you killed.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","March 11, 2014","true","65.9"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","27","35","0","0"

Simply put, every decision you make causes the world to end just a little bit more. An existence-destroying void is following you, and the only solution is to constantly push to the right. You'll have to make detours, whether it's shopping for supplies, exploring for dungeons, or going after some great treasure.\n\nAs with most other Rogue titles, death is permanent...and expected. Your first game might last several minutes, your second might last a few seconds. Dying tends to result in rewards such as new perks, classes, and the ability to store useful items in a vault for future games. This is all dependent on your hero points, a score received at the end of the game. Surviving as long as possible is just one of many ways to accrue points. The character classes and perks offer a good bit of variety in how you approach the game. There are other awards depending on your in-game actions, so it's always worth trying new things and exploring as much as that rapidly expanding void will allow.\n\nAdding to the replay value is the infinite number of randomly-generated worlds. One Way Heroics has numerous online functions, so it's possible for multiple players to explore the same world. While playing, you'll see the status of other heroes and get a sense of their trials and tribulations. When they die, their cause of death will be displayed. You might even happen upon their remains, and score a nice item for yourself. Despite the game's cheap price, it's still receiving great support by the developer. In fact as of this writing there was an update issued just yesterday. Multiple difficulty settings further add to the replay value.\n\nReally though, the main reason I recommend this game is because staying from the void is such a valuable design-decision. Typical rogue games, with their insistence on dark dungeons, tend to bore me. One Way Heroics is very focused, it's linear, but it retains all of the depth that is consistent with the genre. Every decision in the game carries weight, since the void is never far behind. I never get the sense that I'm just meandering around a dungeon looking for a key or a sword or a set of stairs. Every step is essentially proof of life, and it feels like very real progress(though death remains a very real setback).\n\nAll in all, One Way Heroics is an unexpected surprise. I look forward to putting more time into it.","August 30, 2014","true","4.5"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","19","21","0","0"

You start off talking to the Queen after creating your character, now first off playing it, there are instructions on how to control, but theres still no sense of starting & learning to make your way, it just drops you in without much to know, which is quite a minus for starting out. But prior to my last sentence, once you learn, it gets better, a lot better. After you learning the controls, first thing i did was die, why was that? i pondered for the few seconds til i made another game, then i understood, the game keeps scrolling to the right, everytime you do something, & it only stops when you use an ability which makes it stop for 3 turns, which unless you are fighting, or as it suggest when to use it, breaking through walls for which i will cover later, its not always that useful, less a emergency. (it also increases damage during this period)\nAs i said before, it scrolls constantly every turn, & thus this is were the hard choices come in. Your inventory weight is limited, meaning you can only carry so much, & at the start its not that big of an inventory, its allright, but you need to increase it early on by giving up your Levels at a goddess statue in a dungeon, there are several statues, but not in all dungeons, this idea right here is also very interesting, also at the statue you can increase specific skills (Strength, Intelligence, Agility Etc.), which once again, is very interesting & cool. But then theres "Where to go", as you roam there are towns you can pass by which of course you can buy equipment at, & at the same time, in towns (where scrolling does not stop, still gotta keep moving) & outside of towns, there a items you can find, there are a lotta good items you can get, but the problem where in lies with inventory space, if you don't have enough, then ya can't carry, or ya gotta trade it for something else. With limited amount of moves it can be hard to get through, or get to towns & dungeons, which can have major items, but depending on your previous moves, you may not be able to get through, but alas, there is hope. Breaking walls, literally you can beak through while hopped on coolade & 'splore dem dungeons or to get through the towns. (sorry you can't actually be hopped up on coolade) the last thing to mention, past all the things i said, this game can be long, & i mean long, do not expect a short game, the goal is to get to a certain distance & fight a appearing boss, but the distance to get to the boss, can be long, because it is randomized, & even if its at like, 250 distance, getting through 200 is long enough, & it doesn't end there, everytime you start a new quest is randomized, making it different everytime, thus far longer! You either have the decision to play a random generated world, on normal, or hard (Normals hard & long enough) or there are also different modes to playthrough, which i haven't even covered cause of the main game, damn its long!\n\nOne Way Heroics, is a constantly moving, tough decision making, level sacraficing, long tough RPG, & if you like those kind of games, its the right kind for you.\nBut alas here are the plus & minuses of it.\n\nPLUSES\n+Long, with several different modes & the normal game is randomly generated.\n+Challenging, its really tough with the screen scrolling, & random hard enemys can pop up to kill ya instantly if your not prepared.\n+Its an RPG, cmon, whoz dusn' like rpgs.\n+Classes & traits, several different classes & traits to choose from & unlock as you slowly play through.\n+Randomly Generated Worlds\n+Several other different modes besides the story to play through\n+Records Your Run, after making a run, it records the entire thing, which you can save & show others.\n+A Universal Inventory, basically if yur current character dies, but you found such a cool item & ya wanna keep it, you can unlock universal inventory spaces, which can hold items for your next character.\n\nMINUS\n-Really doesn't teach you how to play, or whats happening so much at the beggining\n-Customization, while its not a big deal, there would be a bit more if you could customize your character besides there being just a gender & class choice.","March 9, 2015","true","1.2"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","21","26","2","0"

But this game at base price costs about as much as a cup of coffee from a mid-market coffee chain. I've played it for twenty hours, and it still feels like I'm scratching the surface; after each run, I feel like I learned something about how the game works, about what it wants from me and how to succeed. It's a good feeling. The game is fair but challenging, and for those of us for whom that isn't enough, offers a highly modular difficulty system (base difficulty plus class plus perks, all of different usefulness) to challenge yourself with. There's incremental progress and upgrades to unlock if you'd rather have a barometer of progress other than your own growing skill at the game, which is difficult to quantify, but grinding for these things isn't really an issue -- classes and perks are pretty cheap, at least for the useful ones, and everything else is bonus stuff.\n\nIf you buy the expansion, you're basically getting a game that has double or triple the content of the base game, and also includes a whole bunch of quality of life UI upgrades and balance changes. A lot of the things added are very simple and unobtrusive but satisfying -- things like turning to face the enemies automatically, a little screen to track all of the things you've achieved as each class, more dimensions to facilitate the psuedo-multiplayer. Other additions are bigger -- new classes, new allies, new npcs, new bosses and objectives and missions. While the price of the dlc is triple that of the base game, it's absolutely worth it -- even more so if you can get it on sale. The hours of gameplay/$ ratio is excellent.\n\nIt's also in the class of games that are easy to play while doing something else, like holding a skype conversation or queuing for a match in some other game. It takes very little processor power, deals with tab switching quite agreeably, and time stops while you aren't moving.\n\nAll in all, I think it's a great way to spend an hour or two between doing other things, and ends up being quite moreish once you've wrapped your head around the basic steps to survival. Then, it's all about the rng and your own wits. Recommended.","April 20","true","37.1"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/midnight_tea/recommended/266210/","midnight_tea","Midnight Tea","http://steamcommunity.com/id/midnight_tea/","385 products in account","Even though One Way Heroics is kind of cheaply made in a sense -- being coded in Wolf RPG and somewhat unfortunately prone to crashing now and then -- I find it hard not to recommend. The best description I could give it is that it's a JRPG roguelike that's evocative of "The Neverending Story", a brilliant but bizarre fantasy movie from the 80's. Namely that One Way Heroics is about a hero trying outrun something like the Nothing from said movie -- a darkness slowly creeping and devouring the world -- and confronting evil while also deconstructing certain narrative tropes. I'm not going to spoil anything but while One Way Heroics has a simple story, it's not as simple as it may look and it hints at some deeper and admittedly stirring themes. Again, given all that, it's almost required for Generation Y gamers to occasionally put on the Neverending Story soundtrack esp. if they're playing a Hunter.\n\nI consider it pretty much a must-play for anyone genuinely interested in eventually "getting into" roguelikes, as well for anyone who is interested in designing them. Like any other roguelike, you will die many times and rarely get to keep anything of substance from one run to another. Unlike most of them, One Way Heroics offers detailed feedback about how to improve your future runs and the game over screen NPCs are kind, sympathetic and encouraging. It also strikes a very tight balance between what choices a player has at any given time (especially in character creation) without compromising the unforgiving nature of the roguelike genre. It's also really neat to be playing one that takes place primarily in the great outdoors. On top of all that, the way seeds work lets you share worlds with other players and the game even tracks who is playing what world and when. Defeated players who were playing at the same time as you will even show up in your game to give you random items from their inventory. As I said, it's very novel.\n\nYeah, this isn't a $3.50 you need to second guess for even a moment if you're in the mood for something different or enjoy (or wish you could enjoy) roguelikes. I salute you, Smoking Wolf!\n\n\nBy the way, while the game does a great job of pretty much giving you all the advice you'll need to optimally play it (which I've never seen a roguelike EVER successfully do before now) I strongly recommend using the numpad to move instead of the arrow keys. Holding shift to change direction without moving is very useful too. Also it's not required, but if you see Queen Frieda please give her a hug for me.","March 8, 2014","true","43.9"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lykenstrife/recommended/266210/","Lykenstrife","lykenstrife","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lykenstrife/","79 products in account","A Great Time killing game, hold on Solitare, Chip's Challenge, or whatever you play to kill time, here's ONE WAY HEROICS\nSo after playing this game for a good little bit, I have found that this game could easily be one of those games that you could play to kill time, ALOT of time.\n\nOne of my friends sent me the game and expansion as a gift through Steam, and I tell you what, It's quite an amazing game especially for use old heads that like our RPGs and video games in general with a more retro feel to them. The graphics, by today's standards, aren't the super realistic HD sculptures that a lot of people have come to expect from video games. Instead, the graphics are more of a 16-bit sprites with beautiful choices of color palettes throughout the game. It is very easy to tell when you traverse through different environments, desolate deserts, cold artic tundra, lush beautiful forests and plains. The guards, townsfolk, and inhabitants of the world are just as carefully designed and all look unique.\n\nProbably one of the biggest things that makes this game so great is the gameplay. Imagine a Japanese Style Action RPG with a lot of Rogue like aspects that do nothing, but add to replay value of the game. Everything can be randomized, and like most Rogue Likes perma death is a real thing. About the only thing that you can save, aside from the game, is your character's inventory, or rather a select few items to continue playing with. You get a super awesome sword that when roots your enemies and burns them to death, and you don't really want to let it go? Well there's something called a deminisonal vault that you can use to keep that sword through multiple playthroughs.\n\nSpeaking of that deminisonal vault, the way you get it, and use it is through things called Hero Points. You acquire Hero Points by either completing a full run of the game, or dying. If you die, by some random Dragon Knight in a structure you were checking for loot, drowning in water, or trying to climb to the point of exhaustion and just collapsing. There's also one other very unique way of dying. In this game, you visit a town and you can't revist it, you can't go back the way you came at all. This is because the Dark Lord (boss of the game) is spreading darkness throughout the realm, you touch the darkness and you die. Well the screen scrolls to the right, just like an old school platformer, but instead of being able to go back you can't because of the darkness, if you try, you die. This adds for a significant amount of challenge, you can easily get stuck in areas of the game because of mountains, walls, or whatever other obstacle that impedes your travel, and the darkness catches up and you die. Actually, every action you take, wether it's attacking an enemy, moving, using an item, casting a spell, or whatever moves the darkness closer towards you.\n\nThe Plot is a throw a way plot you are X hero out to slay the Dark Lord and stop the spread of the darkness throughout the world. There's other campaigns that you can do that are fixed maps that have their own story as well, but it follows the same formula.\n\nProbably one of the coolest things about the game is Character Creation. At the beginning of the game you start with two classes, a Swordmaster Class and a Knight Class. You can chose what your sprite looks like, and also give your character perks to help with his stats, or whatever skills you have for the class. You start with three perk slots, but as you play you can unlock up to five perks. This alone gives the game that massive replay value, just to see how every other class works, in a completely different world every single time.\n\nAs you play through the game, and earn Hero Points,  you also gain new classes to run through the game with, each class, plays very differently from the other. You unlock these classes by either spending those Hero Points you've been hoarding, or by completing specific tasks in game. Aside from the Deminsional Vault, and new Classes, the Hero Points also unlock new perks for character creation.\n\nFor us retro gaming fans, especially those who are fans of RPGs that came out before everything looked "pretty" and realistic, this game is a must own. This will probably end up replacing solitare for those people.","October 24, 2015","true","23.2"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","1"

You play as a custom character on a trek to defeat the Demon Lord, a powerful entity that imperils the world with the motivation toward total destruction. Before meeting the tendrils of corruption, the player must endure a certain distance-decided when choosing the various game settings-while destroying hostile creatures.\nHere are a few items of interest within OWH:\n\nGameplay - Aside from other roguelikes, this title’s complexity is derived from its tactical display rather than gameplay, as One Way Heroics utilizes a turn-based approach to combat and item usage. Each in-game action made by the hero utilizes said turns, which advances the daunting foe. The term ‘turn-based strategy’ does not entirely cover this game’s spectrum, however, as every action, whether it be equipping a new weapon or item, or consuming a potion to gain back energy, summons evil one turn closer to the player’s character. Adding to the ominous theme, the darkness swallows the lands you have passed through, and the notification of non-player character deaths can be heard as they disappear into mist. Controls are rather simple on both keyboard and controller, but can be adjusted in the case that they feel awkward. Equipment can be modified within the menus to alter the method of play by adding boons to weapons and armor, but, as stated, this increases danger; these items are gained either as loot from defeated enemies or may be distributed throughout the map. With a high enough Charisma score, the player may also gain discounts from various shops and recruit non-player individuals to the party that will assist in combatting foes and leveling up.\n\nCharacter Creation & Upgrades - Characters comprise of several customizable components, such as name, class, avatar, and perk and statistical preferences chosen by the player; perks may also grant players companions or other game modifications such as quicker swimming or improved unarmed damage. These adjustments allow the player to modify how they would like to play according to the class. Additional equipment may alter damage totals to enemies or reduce them toward the player’s character. Levelling up in OWH operates in a similar way to other titles, as it improves the character’s base statistics depending on which class was chosen.\n\nUnlockables - Depending on how far the player’s character progresses in the campaign, a number of Hero Points are rewarded to the player to purchase game augments. These modifications increase the amount of content usable by the player, such as said hero classes, perks-with selections for both combat and other skills-, and expanding what’s known as the Dimensional Vault: an item-storage system in which adventurers may donate a number of items from preceding generations to the next living hero. This expands play so that the entire game is not just an uphill battle with no reward when so close to the resolve, but rather contains encouragement toward progression.\n\nTL:DR - One Way Heroics is a fun, simple, and rewarding title with incentive to advance toward the Demon Lord time and time again. There is a great amount of challenge involved in this title, but does not evoke frustration due to its Hero Point system. Though the accolade of defeating the ultimate evil may not be reached every time, the journey is a fantastic ride filled with choice, vicious battle, and sacrifice. I highly recommend this title to anyone who enjoys roguelikes and simple roleplaying mechanics. This game has a great deal of replayability, and I hope you enjoy upon purchase. Thanks for reading.\n\nDo you enjoy these reviews?

Do I want more people to buy it both before and after the sale, which by the way is a ridiculously small price to pay for such a deep and interesting game? Absolutely 100% yes. I first saw this game on Greenlight a few months back, and I honestly thought it looked like crap. Seeing that it went on sale for eighty-seven cents, I figured I'd sell a few cards off and buy it, which turned out to be probably the best idea I've had throughout the whole summer sale.\n\nI really honestly love roguelikes, and this is about as good as it gets for me. Tough enemies? Check. General time constraints? You bet. Omnipresent instant-death wall that constantly follows you and kills the NPCs you pass by? Oh, yes. There's so much to love about this game, and that's just with the gameplay. The story is honestly one of the best I've seen in a game so seemingly small and shallow (though, that was only on the surface). What starts as a quest to kill a Demon Lord over and over turns into so much more, but I won't spoil anything here. There's so much rich backstory to get around to, and close to (or I think exactly?) a dozen endings to unlock. The endings may be short, but they're very, very sweet. The wordplay is a bit awkward, at times, but most of the endings managed to evoke the emotions I feel they were meant to.\n\nThis game caught me so far off-guard, that I ended up 100%ing it, getting every epilogue, and every achievement, in just twenty-two hours of gameplay. That may not seem like much, but I went super hard and no-life'd it. Not because I wanted to get it done as quickly as possible, but because I wanted to challenge myself to completely finishing it in as little time as I could. Would I do it all again, casually? Yes, and I plan to play it now and then when I get bored, trying new character builds and strategies, and getting the highest heroics scores I can manage.\n\nI'd absolutely recommend this game, again. Buy it. It's cheap (as of writing this review) AND it's cheap in general, at only $3.50. Buy it. You (probably) won't regret it. If you like roguelikes, that is.

With the first difficulty already being hard and the other difficulties and scenarios much harder than the previous one, this game makes you carefully plan your decisions (through movements, skills, choosing appropiate stats, and watching your three bars closely) in order to even get close to killing the final boss. All of the classes have a completely different playstyle (besides that most of them require you to use basic attacks to damage) to even get past the 100m mark. And although you start fresh everytime you begin a new character, the game rewards you by allowing you to keep a limit of items from past runs to aid your next. All of these elements combine to create a satisfacting experience that can be enjoyed by any RPG player and can consume time faster than you consume a bucket of KFC chicken. The soundtrack is worth a mention as well, fitting and worthy of rocking your head to the beat at the speed of the tempo. I would highly recommend this game to all RPG fans looking for a fair amount of difficulty, and recommend all casual players to give it a go as well. It's more than well worth its price of $3.49, so try this amazing masterpiece of a turn-based slightly pixelated RPG.","April 3, 2014","true","42.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

Maybe a couple of hours fun or an atrasfomany like so many others. You know? The type of game where you take a break from a big game just to break the pace a bit? It has that quality sure. But never did I expect the amount of content, replayability and just plain fun I have had with this game so far. I haven't even tried out harder difficulties and many of the classes I have yet to unlock! I'll tell you about some time spent in game.\n\nI played this a bit on my own and a friend said it looked interesting. So I got it for him...the price is too good *insert subliminal buy now message* and Smoking Wolf deserves it for the excellent work!\nThis game isn't co-op but we chose the same map to kinda compete and help each other out.\nWe got into the same map. A nice, easy, stroll in the park difficulty map for his first time. He chose the Swordmaster class and I choose the Force user. Me being all experienced from my 2-3 hours game time, ran off looking for treasures, things to kill and xp.\nWhile happily one shotting every thing (first time Force user class...dayum) he asks some questions about the mechanics, the tutorial isn't great but you can figure most things out.\nI run into a Carzy Dragon knight, or something simliar, whom I one shot with glee because these guys are tough and I've died to them many times!\nMeanwhile my friend runs around, way behind, having a grand time. Some time passes.\nSuddenly he yells:\n"Oh **** that guy just killed me!"\nMe: "What? Who killed you?"\nHim: "Some guy in a building! What the hell!? He just killed me in one hit!"\nMe: "Huh? Where? All these creeps are pretty basic. Noob! Thought you had this old gamer style!? Hahahahaha!"\n\nWe pride ourselves on being born gamers (another way of saying we are getting old), because we do well or above average in most games, having played games since the first Commodores. So if a game is hard or we fail our pride takes quite a hit.\n\nHim: "Some green dude in building with chests. What the ****!? Such BS..."\n\nRealization dawns. Fail friend...\n\nMe: "Hahahahaa! Sorry dude forgot to tell you those green dragon knight guys are very tough! I had no problem. Just one shot them muehehehehehe."\n\nWith his fail run of the map he somehow managed to unlock the Adventurer class and decides to try it out on the same map.\n\nHim: "Ok so screw that place, Ima go ova mere." Apologies...he actually talks like that.\nHim: "OMF A ****ING BEAR!"NOOO!!"\nMe: "Hahaahhaa a bear!? What the hell man, you have the worste luck!"\nHim: "Noooo! He has friends!! They're chasing meeeee! They're chasing meeeeee!!! Aahhhh!"\n\nJust rofling at his attempts to run away from the killer bears. He dies horribly gain.\n\nHim: "**** those bears. I'm gonna get them."\nMe: "Dude bears are sick, we don't even have gear or levels to kill them, just go take another route."\nHim: "Nah **** that. Them bears are going down!"\nMe: "Psh, good luck fool."\n\nHe restarts.\n\nHim: "Ok they're coming for me, gonna lead them to these guards."\nMe: "Could work, maybe."\nim: "Shweet! The guards did all the work for me! See I told you I'd get those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!"\nMe: "Nice one. Now you can finally catch up. Sheesh you suck! You've only gone like 20km all this time. I'm almost to the Demon Lord."\nHim: "Oh my sweet cheesus balls..."\nMe: "More bears?"\nHim: "Duuuuuuude..."\nMe: "What?"\nHim: "Duuuuuuude..."\nMe: "WHAT?!"\nHim: "Duuuuuuude...I just picked up a Godslaying longsword...."\nMe: "What the ****!? Where?" <----already turning jelly.\nHim: "From a Feral Dog! Hahaha! I just killed it and it dropped this! It has X and Y and OMFG check this Z out"\nMe: "..."  -.-\nHim: "Omg this thing is ridiculous! ###dmg in one hit! Gib, hahahahahah...gib, hahahahahaha!"\nMe: "How the **** does that drop from a dog!?" all jelly now, and greedy.\nHim: "I dunno. You're s'posed to be the expert...gib, hahahahahaha!"\nMe: "..." full of jelly and careless.\nMe: "**** I just died trying to open a stupid chest."\nHim: "The darkness?"\nMe: "Yes the darkness."\nHim: "Noob. Gib, hahahahahah!"\n\nHe dies later because he didn't watch his Hp and we decide that dimension YYOCIFHH  has beaten us...for now. But HE gets to take his Godslaying sword over to the next level if he wants...where is MY Godlsaying longsword?? Sorry. Still jelly he got it and I didn't.\n\nThis is what I like about this game:\n\nCool new map any time you want. Adventuring and never knowing what you might find.\nLeveling and getting loot...so much loot. I cry a little bit every time I have to drop an unidentified item.\nThe mechanics and gameplay are simple but I think mastering each class will be a challenge.\nThis is "Roguelike" to a degree but far enough away to not make it grindy, repetitive and boring after 20 games.\n\nI never expected this to become one the games I regard with this much respect.\nSo grab it! *insert subliminal buy now message* You won't regret spending a penny.\n\nThanks for reading and thanks for a cool game Mr Wolf!","March 17, 2015","true","21.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","7","8","5","0"

The catch is that every time you replace previous items you can only use items from that particular play-through.

Holy christ just getting set up to face the end is difficult enough " trying to avoid spoilers" once you become dedicated to trying to make something happen. Every step makes your heart race. as usually " in my case" a pack of 5 ultimate dragon knights come around the corner,  And then demon lord spawns and then i get ambushed by bandits.   A single unintresting easily beaten increased difficulty quest run, turned in to an epic quest, gaining allies. Finding Sacred weapons. fighting hordes of demons, because the spawn rate hated me. and eventually truly once and for all saving the world.\n\nMy last play through has left me wanting soo much more one way heroics","August 25, 2014","true","100.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I'd put it at number 2 in my book.\nThe companions are terrific; each have their own stories and quests. I don't think I've ever seen a roguelike with a story that was actually compelling.\nThe spell casting is phenomenal, something I could never enjoy in Nethack, Slash'em, and other turnbased roguelikes.\nTerrific soundtracks, another thing that many roguelikes lack. I'd say on-par, maybe better, than FTL soundtracks.\nIMO, this game has an excellent balance of luck vs tactical sense (Its not a total crapshoot but there is enough randomness to make repeat playthroughs rewarding and fun.\nIncredible sense of adventure as you flee the oncoming doom from the west; different biomes offer unique challenges and enemies.\nMost people don't realize there are actually THREE ways to win. If you think you da man just because you stomped the demon lord, think again. You ain't done yet, lil ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nAnd... its 87 cents during sales.

You can survive sometimes by just spamming  'z' on monsters and get away with like 2hp.But the game is not about surving. You need to build up your character, make decisions on whether to give up 5 lvls to increase stats such as strength. There are so many different variations it's nearly endless fun.\n\nThere are different gamemodes , many classes with their unique skill set and many types of weapons.

The game is set in the style of an old Japanese RPG but with the twist of the Darkness coming from the left side of the screen, essentially moving roughly 1/3 - 5/12 of a block every turn. You have to continue running to the right and beating off monsters that hunt you down like a wild animal. There are multiple difficulty levels in this game, starting with a Walk in the Park difficulty, which is where the End-Boss appears at 400 km and you get npcs to help you when he appears (basically easy mode).\n\nThere are multiple choices of class in this game, each with it's own Steam achievement, and each with it's own unique skill set/passive stats. The 8 different classes are Swordmaster, Knight, Hunter, Pirate, Bard, Adventurer, Force User (Mage), and Hero. Some of the classes are rather overpowered, where they can one hit anything with a sword or axe that has at least 10-15 Attack power, and some of them are very weak, requiring you to play like a coward and run until you can get a Holy item or find equipment that makes you super powered. Although there is a lack of creativity in the active skills of each class (basically just Awakening, and some skill you learn at level 1), the uniques are nice to play around with. For example, the pirate has a maxed out Swimming unique, where he uses only 1 turn to swim instead of 5. In terms of playability with the classes, you essentially master one, usually the Hero class, and run through the whole thing playing strategically.\n\nThere is an element of playability where you can transfer over items that you really like or want to use on a different playthrough called the Dimensional Vault. After you die or beat the game, you can place items, up to a limit, in the Vault and access it through your next character. This was a nice idea, but I feel like instead of having a NPC that you have to talk to in order to access it, there should be an option to ask you if you want to access your vault at the very beginning of the game, after you've already started. Another thing the developers added were perks. There is a very limited number of perks, and it's a nice addition. Lastly, there is the Heroics leve ratings, where you get rated from F - SS on how well you did in the criteria of Levels, Battles, Chests looted, and Distance. This was really sweet, and there is also the bonus points that you get for certain actions, like killing no friendly characters. This portion makes you want to play again until you get it right, and I loved it. It could definitely be expanded upon.\n\nI really enjoyed the dimensions, but it feels very plain when using "Create random dimension". When you create a random dimension, it's just a normal dimension with everything placed around differently, no bonuses to equipment, unique NPCs that can join you, or any of that sort. It's just a map with the areas randomized. However, every day, the game updates a few special campaign dimension, about 3-4, and they have unique differences. Some have stronger monsters for more experience, others have a special NPC that you can recruit. Those are nice, but they only change once a day, and though it's a nice catch to get people to play every day, when you beat the game a couple times, it gets very boring and you lose interest of even looking at the list.\n\nThat being said, the time you do spend playing this game would be worth it, especially for a low price. It's super cheap, fun for a good amount of time, and you can replay through the campaigns as much as you want. The perks are very limited however, and I do hope they update it to have a comprehensive list of unique skills, and possibly vary the classes more to feel more balanced.","March 6, 2014","true","21.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Basically, you're just running right in an 8-bit, procedurally-generated world, trying to become as strong as you can by fighting enemies and picking up a ton of different pieces of equipment and items before the final boss of the world comes to ♥♥♥♥ your ♥♥♥♥ up. There's an interesting gimmick involved though, you can't just stop and grind on enemies or bother trying to crack open a chest because darkness is forever swallowing the world from the left. This makes things incredibly interesting, because every step you take is another few pixels or so that the darkness is moving towards you. Every "turn" you take to attack, every person you talk to, every shop you enter, every enemy you kill is another chance for the darkness to eat your world.

I don't know about you but if I followed the concept of "$1 = 1 hour gameplay" then this is definitely worth lots more than what it's priced at.\n\n-Overviews and stuff- (if you just want the opinion go straight to it)\n\nYou play as the "almighty" hero and continue travelling right to take down the demon lord who is slowly consuming the world in darkness. This darkness will continue following you throughout your travels.

This means you may share a dimension with friends (though you won't see them, you'll see how they did).\n\nIn case you don't know what rogue-likes are, they are basically games that start you at level 1 and if you end up at the game over screen you have to start the game all over again, at level 1. Games like these however will allow you to carry certain 'things' over to your next playthrough. In this case, you'll be allowed to carry a limited amount of items you found across your previous travels (the limit of items can be increased as well).\n\nWith One Way Heroics, you'll want to explore as much of an area as you can because you cannot stick around for long, and this is the part I liked best about this game. Exploring dungeons is risky because walls end up being an obstacle (and possibly sandwich you with the darkness if you can't get out). Don't stick around towns for too long as you'll want to do what you need to do then get out so then they can die and you'll continue on your journey.\n\nThere's quite a number of items you can obtain in-game, dungeons to explore and as you finish your playthrough, you'll see your "Heroic rating". Depending on your rating, you'll earn certain amounts of Heroic points to use to unlock perks, classes and the cap limit of your dimensional vault.

The cap limit can be increased with heroic points and become more costly the more space you have.\n\n-Opinion(s)-\n\nThere's a lot to why I find this game enjoyable but I'll tell you the main ones.\n\n1. The concept is pretty simple, and when it comes to concepts, I usually prefer simple ones. It's how you execute the concept is what appeals to me the most. This game actually did a great job at it and you'll be reminded very 'clearly' as well. I personally liked it and of course, this is basically my opinion of it. It'll either be a hit or a miss. Definitely a hit for me.\n\n2. Usually when it comes to RPG, I tend to think that there will be a lot of items that aren't neccessary but are there anyway for the quanitity. Most cases I prefer quality over quantity and in this case, it was the right amount for either two. You won't find many things necessary but they are useful items so it is completely up to you how you want to play and you'll have a variety of items to venture with.\n\n3. The gameplay mechanics are simple but for this top-down it also features diagonals (yes, very strange for a top-down to certain people but this added more of a challenge and I enjoyed it). I enjoy playing with a controller and I'm glad I don't have to actually use my mouse or keyboard at all to play this game.\n\n4. Music. Why? It was great to listen to when I played the game and never thought about turning it off.\n\n5. After you die or finish the game, you get to choose a variety of messages to tell others how you died or survived the struggle in dimensions. Even if the game ends, I'll be left satisfied with these messages (and unlocking more stuff).\n\n6. Bread crusts. You'll understand once you play the game and meet the chefs.\n\nOverall, I was very close to missing out this amazing game. I usually don't play top-downs, rogue-likes and what not but this game, whether you play games like this or not, I recommend you at least give it a go. It's not a grindfest and it's not too hard to pick up as well. It's also a cheap game, whether you get it on sale or not.

Normally this isn't really a problem, you can easily outrun the slowly-progressing darkness.\nIn case of emergency you can use your Awakening ability up to 5 times, which stops the time for 3 turns so you can get yourself out of trouble.\n\nUsually whenever you die, it is because you weren't careful, you will learn from most deaths.\nMost of the time there are ways to save yourself, but you just didn't try or think of everything or were too cocky, though of course there are also times when the game really seems to hate you.\n\nThere are multiple endings depending on how you beat the game and which NPC you have with you.\nMoreover when you beat the game you can store some items in your vault, which you can choose to use at the beginning of each run.\n\nLastly, it's a single-player game, but while playing the game online it will show you details about other players who are in the same dimension and occasionally you will meet ghosts of other fallen players who will drop one of their items and give you experience.\nFurthermore after clearing a dimension it will show you the characters of everyone who completed it as well.\n\nFor the price, especially when it's on sale, it's a steal.\nI definitely also recommend buying OWH+ if you already enjoyed the base game, it adds a lot of new content.","May 16","true","54.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The cycle of a steam game and the end of playtime. Though we mostly have unplayed games in our library, we want to give each and every one of them at least a try. It is in such desperate times we find ourselves caught between playing League of Legends or playing a few minutes on Steam, as we don't have enough time for all the games we own. However, this one is a very important game you must try.\n\nAlthough One Way Heroics is like a piece of artwork, even the most popular one might not be suited for everyone. It's for that I spend so much time writing these great reviews.  Despite how much we bare ourselves, no matter the cost, no matter the repercussions, there is always something more to say about a good game... but sometimes it is best to not say anything and just let the game communicate it's strengths and weaknesses, and take the gameplay over reviews.\n\nThis is one of those unique games.

One Way Heroics, to its credit, trends more toward skill from my play time so far. There are moments of failure, but they are logical moments.\n\n"Whoops. Forgot about the scrolling screen of doom."\n"Whoops. Ignored the icon above an enemy showing it's a miniboss."\n"Whoops. Forgot about my potions."\n\nThat's what is refreshing about the game; every failure makes sense. Often, that isn't the case in other examples of the genre. Each game has its own unique learning curve and priorities, of course. But this isn't the kind of game where you decide to drink a potion and roll the dice on it being poison or acid. It's far more structured than that, with information clearly presented to the player. This ensures that any difficulty is genuine, and not just a random number generator. I can appreciate that.\n\nAside from that noteworthy benefit, One Way Heroics is pretty cool on its own merits. Classic pixellated graphics aren't rare, but the game uses them in a charming way rather than seeming budget-minded. The scrolling mechanic is fairly unique, and adds elements of point-focused gaming such as Cannabalt. It's a simple thing, but executed just right to encourage that "one more run" mindset.\n\nIn short: I got this game less than a day ago, and I already feel like I've got my money's worth and then some.

Well, that's kind of trivializing it a bit as there are a bunch of abilities, weapons, and generally oodles of lootles to find and methods of keeping them from game to game.  There's also a save system, so it's not entirely roguelike at all, but close to a J-ARPG from the dayes of Yore.\n\nAhem... the main mechanic of the game is that the world is constantly scrolling into oblivion (the game is turn-based so as long as you stand still, nothing happens) and you need to keep moving right until you meet the boss.  If you make it that far.  If you can survive.  If you brought/found the right gear.\n\nRegardless, success or fail, once you've concluded a run, you earn Hero Points in order to unlock character classes, abilities, perks, and most importantly, slots for your DImensional Vault.  Whazzat?  Easy - it's a safe to store items you've found so you can give it to the next hero you roll.  Pretty simple stuff.\n\nPresentation is great, sounds are perfectly retrofit, and the only hit against it (considering this thing is priced less than a hamburger) is that it's a bit unstable.  Good thing there's a save system.\n\nAnyways, if you have money in your pocket, you could spend it on stupider things than One Way Heroics; don't.

It's neck and neck with Banner Saga, and though Banner Saga definitely has a greater immersion factor, the pick-up-and-play roguelike aspects and the replayability of OWH put it over the top.\n\nWhat you have here is a game with the energy and fun of a classic Japanese RPG on the Super Nintendo, but with the ruthless difficulty and randomness of a roguelike. However, the developer very wisely simplifies the roguelike formula, so that you are not playing an overly complicated survival simulation; you are playing a game that feels both fun and intense; it is demanding of your judgment without being a drain on the limits of your attention span.\n\nIt's not perfect; once you've seen the 3 or 4 variations of "towns" and "dungeons" in the game they'll get stale quick. Enemy and landscape variety becomes a little threadbare after a few (successful) playthroughs as well. Also, even in full screen mode, the characters are ridiculously small. Don't even bother trying to play in windowed mode. You might as well go outside and stare at ants.\n\nThe achievements are very good as well; they're almost all challenge-oriented, encouraging you to push your skills to their limit, rather than go out of your way to fulfill random garbage achievements (I'm looking at you, Rogue's Tale).\n\nOne Way Heroics is a badass game, especially for the price.","March 25, 2014","true","27.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's a fairly simple roguelike that's really quick (1-2 hours) and rewarding, has a lot of different classes to play, four difficulties, multiple endings, and has different maps and challenges every day.\n\nEvery adventure earns you hero points, which you can use to buy new perks or shared bank space (to hand down items to new characters) after you die or win.\n\nThere are multiplayer feeds that show what other players are doing at the same time, and you'll often encounter helpful ghosts of players who died in that dimension. At the end of each adventure you can get a scrolling credit-roll of all the heroes who won.\n\nGreat simple and fun game, and highly replayable.","March 24, 2014","true","10.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

One Way Heroics, to its credit, trends more toward skill from my play time so far. There are moments of failure, but they are logical moments.\n\n"Whoops. Forgot about the scrolling screen of doom."\n"Whoops. Ignored the icon above an enemy showing it's a miniboss."\n"Whoops. Forgot about my potions."\n\nThat's what is refreshing about the game; every failure makes sense. Often, that isn't the case in other examples of the genre. Each game has its own unique learning curve and priorities, of course. But this isn't the kind of game where you decide to drink a potion and roll the dice on it being poison or acid. It's far more structured than that, with information clearly presented to the player. This ensures that any difficulty is genuine, and not just a random number generator. I can appreciate that.\n\nAside from that noteworthy benefit, One Way Heroics is pretty cool on its own merits. Classic pixellated graphics aren't rare, but the game uses them in a charming way rather than seeming budget-minded. The scrolling mechanic is fairly unique, and adds elements of point-focused gaming such as Cannabalt. It's a simple thing, but executed just right to encourage that "one more run" mindset.\n\nIn short: I got this game less than a day ago, and I already feel like I've got my money's worth and then some. Give it a shot.\n\n","April 1, 2014","true","11.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It also ranks in difficulty with the likes of Mega-Man, Ninja Gaiden, and Castlevania.\nThe foundation of Heroics would make it seem like two things that should never go together.\nOn the left side of the screen, the world fades into a Darkness that consumes men, women,  children, small animals, dungeon bosses, buildings, eveything. It is your job to find out what is causing the darkness by travelling to the ends of the earth and defeating the source (oh, and the final boss has finally attained some common sense, and will randomly spawn in an effort to kill you before you get enough power and equipment to wreck his world.)  It would start to sound as if it's an infinite runner (akin to Temple Run and Flappy Bird).\nAnd then there are the RPG elements.\nRandomly generated worlds, item upgrades, exploration, looting, unlockable perks and classes, the element of permadeath between save points (random enemy drops and treasures will not be the same after continuing from a save file), and the random enemy attributes lead one to question their sanity.\nEach playthrough is different. You have the option to create a new random world every time that you start a new game, but you can also play through the same world as different classes.\nThere are 8 different classes in total, (Only the Knight and Swordmaster are available at the start, but with additional playthroughs, the roster expands with Hunter, Pirate, Bard, Adventurer, Force User, and Hero) with very different play styles. Swordmasters are tough, but it comes at a cost to stamina and carrying capacity. Hunters, however, are better suited to stealth, ranged weapons, and have a special ability that allows them to see off-screen enemies before they encounter them.\nAll in all, it's got great addictive gameplay, the sprite animations are charming, the music is fantastic , and I would give this an 8-8.5","March 2, 2014","true","15.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Being in that cross-categorical genre does require a certain amount of luck with each playthrough, but with this title a level of strategic thinking is also necessary. The ever present "Darkness" coming at your character from the lefthand side of the screen forces you to make difficult decisions - should I visit that town in the North or the dungeon in the South? There isn't time to do both.\nWith a multitude of unlockables (character classes, starting perks, slots in the "shared stash"), there is a tremendous amount of replayability here.\nI highly recommend this title.","March 2, 2014","true","10.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

So, I thought I'd grab myself a copy; I was very much satisfied. :owforce:\n\nOne Way Heroics, being a rogue-like on the run, is quite a fun experience.  I was afraid it would be extremely time limit based, which I despise, but I was thankfully proven wrong.  While you do always have to be on the run from the shadowy darkness from the left, you can play a pretty much infinite game...  Just, be aware things will get stronger, and that the Demon Lord will continuously hunt your butt down.\n\nWhile I extremely enjoy this game, the friend I saw buy this, did not.  This game is not for everyone, but to give you an idea of the games I like, you could say this game is similar, but on a certain degree, to...  FTL: Faster Than Light and Dungeons of Dredmor.\n\nIf you're still not quite sure, and if $3.49 is still a bit much for you, I highly suggest picking up a copy when it goes on sale, even one as low as 25% off. :3","September 15, 2014","true","46.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This may seem like a simple mechanic, or maybe something that would limit the fun you could have, but it's honestly what makes this game so addicting.\n\nYou have to plan ahead. If you blindly rush into any dungeon you see you'll likely find yourself stuck behind a wall, frantically trying to break it down as the darkness creeps up from behind. You have to consider whether you can clear it before the darkness catches up, whether you have the HP and gear required to take on the monsters inside, and whether to advance into a room or wait and let the mobs come at you one by one.\n\nIt encourages you to pack all those items that you'd discard without a second thought in other games. Scroll of Confusion? Use it on the Demon Lord so you can run away while he flails randomly. Teleportation Pill? Use it when caught behind a mountain range and pray it drops you on the other side. (Seriously, watch the map. Mountains are just as dangerous as monsters.) Nayuta Fruit? Use it when in a snow area to replenish your energy. Big stone? . . . Leave it, this one is actually useless.\n\nThe character classes are reasonably varied. Each class starts with different stats and abilities depending on what their purpose is. For instance, the Knight has the Great Wall ability, which lets him regen health every turn. While the Bard has the Song of Heroism, which increases party members damage and defence. There's also an adventurer class, with stats that make him perfect for stashing as much loot as possible.\n\nThe world generation is simple, but effective. You'll be seeing the same tiles over and over again, with few real differences between the biomes. Thing is, it's the layout that matters, not the scenery. It's the generation of Alters of the Goddess, towns, Dark Brotherhood hidouts, and Golems (Be very prepared before you try to take these things on) that make each new world interesting.\n\nAfter each run you'll be awarded Hero Points which you can spend to unlock new perks, classes, and expand your Vault. (In which you can store items from your previous run, in order to use them in the next.)\n\nThe last feature, and judging from the other reviews here also the most unappreciated, are the story missions. These change every day, one day you'll be accompanied by the healer Dosey, the next you'll be tasked with rescuing the Queen. Each of these NPCs have different stories which you'll learn more about as you fight with them. These really make adventuring more interesting, and are a nice addition to the game. They didn't have to be there, but it's nice that they are.\n\nOne Way Heroics is, in my opinion, criminally underpriced. I fully recommend picking this up.","March 9, 2015","true","75.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Defeat the Demon Lord in a whole different dimension with this unmissable addition.\n\nLiterlly the DLC and the Whole entire game in a nutshell\n\nIf you are a fan of Rouge like Dungeons / Openworlds like Minecraft - Binding Of Issac series, and Cyrpt of the Necrodancer. Then this game is also a must in your inventory of wonderous games.\n\nI personally would like to say I spent countless hours offline and online on this game. Trust me, it may look low now. But I spent 100+ of hours playing this... Why? I had worlds to explore. I maybe explored over 1000+ worlds and yet have to save not even 40% of them yet.\n\nYou get to choose your class and you are already set to go on a journey of a everlasting battle of darkness. Not only that,  the darkness is actually a dragon!  is also a very impending doom of your very world you travel and  saving!\n\nFear not, you have time on your hand. No joke, time is of the essance and so is key placement, fighting, item usage and your weapon durability. May I also say you have a day/night cycle? Vision ? More over that you have Bonuses and debuffs? Even more so you can find allies! Even if you're willing to sacrifice some of your levels,  A bard and hero is more sufficient in creating a co-op NPC!  you can obtain some Cooperating Enemies or other misc!.\n\nThe content of the first game is already a great stand alone game. But the expansion far over gives it more power and bang for your buck. Even at a sale price, the game is fantastic. The updates are nearly weekly and they are on the clock * LOL PUNS* constantly checking for bugs and patching new campaigns.\n\nThe classes are easy to understand, the game mechanics simply easy to use, and if delt well , very useful to master. As time, placements, and generally the whole landscape. You too can already learn the many ways of becoming heroic.\n\nThere is also a _Afterdeath_ Screen where you can save, trade, expend, repair, and increase your items you collected in your traveling of the worlds. Hell you can even gain items you can't get in certain campaings. But if you complete it , you gain special other perks, even endings you can get if you finally get them!\n\nGame has perks in it... PERKS! Even Debuffs that make your heroic level skyrocket, but not for the faint of heart. As the Debuffs increase levels, yes, but make your game FAR more Harder and more time pinching then the other easy pickings. Even if you think you got a nice going class you like and you unlock another and gain them the right set for them. You want to try to get more classes.\n\nThe DLC does that for you, it adds 4 more classes, ON TOP with more perks, settings, increase in more items, drops, enemies. Even more campaigns you can do in your  Castle Renavations and also other main / side quests!  More toys to find. Even going beyond the limit. The world never ends.\n\nThe Pros\nRouge Like - Infinite Possiblities\nLow Price\nTrading Cards\nRetro Gameplay with innovative tactics.\nWeekly Updates / New Campaigns\nGreat for Game Stuffers and Collectors!\nGreat storyline - Mini Campaigns with Plots and Events\nGreat Quick Game for short players - Walk in the Park if you have a break in your schedule!\nThe Cons\n\nTime Waster - Somewhat good too.\nSlightly challenging to a new RPG Player if not prepared -  Be Fairly Warned - If going for harder campaigns and doing it for cheevies, I suggest trying to use Hero / Knight Classes to survive if not, Bet your heroic tush goodbye! [spoiler/]\nNo Multiplayer Base - But What you expect? I said *Co-op* but it's your Allies you make in game.\nOptions and HUD UI a bit ... Cluttered but I let it slide as it trying to keep all your info in the game as you travel without the need of constant back tracking.\nAll in All A very great game, I love it, I play it, I am Addictted to it.\n\nIn my score I give it 9.2 / 10 Review\n\n9.5/10 - Gameplay\n9.0/10 - Music / OST\n9.0/10 - Graphics\n8.5/10 - Storyline\n10/10  - Creativity and Originality","March 24","true","39.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You need to beat the game multiple times on different difficulties and with different characters, to find out more about the story.\n-Great replay value if you like walking east every time.\n\nOverall I'd say this is a good game for the completionists, who dont mind doing the same thing in a randomized world over and over again.\n\nI wouldn't recommend buying this if you're not planning on spending hours unlocking the characters and the different endings or difficulties.\n\nDLC EDIT:\n\n-Monster spawn more and items spawn randomly, so no more waiting or sitting around\n-More items have been added and the spawn rate has been reworked so powerfull items are more rare\n-More story has been added and the main story has been completed.\n-Mini bosses have been added\n-Random events have been added\n-More terrain has been added\n-More NPC's and shops/dungeons have been added\n\nThe DLC is a great addition to the game, the events, mini bosses and random loot will keep you busy during your runs, while the extra quests and companions will keep you coming back for more.\n\n(I apologise for my bad english)","March 22, 2015","true","132.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

The game forces you to constantly advance and that really gives the game a very good pacing; the interface isn't clunky which often is the case with more traditional roguelikes, but the game doesn't dumb down anything either.\n\nThe game got an amazing attention to details, and lots of effort has clearly been put into things that most will never notice, but that really makes the game worth replaying over and over against, because you always find new things every time. Clearing the game first looks very simplistic, but once you defeat the demon lord you'll realize that there's far more to the game than you thought.\n\nThe graphics aren't impressive, but they work well for the game, and the artwork can be quite charming at times.","June 8, 2014","true","25.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There's a darkness steadily advancing from the left.  If you get caught in it, it kills you, so you'll be steadily advancing to the right.  There's a demon lord that'll show up at some point to try to kill you.  It's your job to kill him first.  That's pretty much the story.\nThis is essentially a turn based RPG.  Every step you take, action you make, etc. is matched by both the encroaching darkness and all other creatures/NPCs in the game.  As you progress right, you'll run into friendly NPCs that can sell/buy/give items, enemies that want to end your quest, random items strewn across the landscape...pretty much everything you'd expect from an RPG.\nThe worlds you'll play on are randomly generated, so you have the option of a new map each time you play, although you also have the option of playing a world you or someone else has already played by inputting a code.  So, if you find a world you like, you can keep returning to it, or you can keep exploring new layouts...although if you return to a dimension already visited, there will still be some things that change, as shops will have different stocks and random item drops will be different.\nYou start out with two classes available(and a male and female skin for each one), and as you either perform tasks during your attempts(killing an enemy with a bow, for example, unlocks the Hunter class) or spend the points you accumulate at the end of each run, you will unlock more classes and various boosts for your characters, known as perks.\nThere's something about this game that keeps managing to pull me back in, even after it humiliates me.  This game is not much in the way of being forgiving.  Your character is pretty weak to start out each run, and there's always a good chance that a fairly strong monster will be hanging around a few meters from the start to make you notice just how weak you are, and there are always chances you'll take the wrong path through some terrain and get pinned behind a wall of mountains that you won't be able to cross before the darkness catches you.  But, even with that, there's always a chance the next run will drop off an awesome weapon early on, or the planets will align perfectly and you'll take a golden path through the land and take down the Demon Lord with ease...only to never be able to recreate that run again.\n\nSo yes.  I highly recommend this game.","April 19, 2014","true","10.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The combination and design makes progression interesting, as gameplay never really stagnates because of the wall keeping you moving forward and requiring you to make decisions. "Is it worth it to enter this dungeon? Will I have a way to get out in time? Can I reach the shopkeeper before the appraiser gets eaten by the darkness?". At the end, you have to battle the boss, the Demon Lord who summoned the wall of death, which packs quite a punch compared to everything else you fight. To aid you, you can find loot, money...all your traditional JRPG elements, but streamlined to be as fast-paced as possible.\n\nThe presentation is a mixed bag. Sprites are tiny but appropriate, and look very much like what you'd expect in a Super NES RPG. Music is not the best ever, but makes itself noticeable when needed, and stays out of the way during the less exciting parts. Controls are very simple and consoley, but doesn't really need a pad to be enjoyed, as it controls with mostly 3 keys and directions. The interface is however quite confusing, with vital stats near the middle of the screen, with other stats at the bottom, buffs at the right...it's a bit all over the place and takes a bit to get used to, but at least you can get used to it after a couple rounds.\nLarger character artwork is also a mixed bag, with some portraits looking good, others looking kinda bland. Character design is very old-school JRPG medieval fantasy, a bit retro while at it, looks more 90s than 2010s if you get what I mean. I guess it is a good effort at looking old-school.\nAs for gameplay decisions, it's all quite slick. Weapons have durability, but are usually easy enough to replace, and repairing is possible, while not straightforward. To compensate, the limit on enchantments, buffs and powerups for each individual weapon or armor is quite big, allowing to kind of craft superweapons with a bit of luck or planning, not too much. Dungeons, terrain and towns are terribly simplistic, but then again, you can't really stay more than a dozen turns in most places, so it works out for the best. There's plenty of decent loot lying around as well, although deciding what stuff to keep and what to drop to satisfy your weight limits can bring the action to a temporary halt as you ponder advantages and disadvantages, or wondering if that unidentified item is crap or highly enchanted.\nAn average game from start to finish can take like 40 minutes. Since it's designed to be played over and over, difficulty is high, and you can store lucky drops for your characters, replay value is pretty good. Specially if you are into beating high scores, a bit of an outdated concept in general, but works pretty well here. Different classes, builds and worlds play quite differently, so there's noticeable variety. Special and shared worlds also have leaderboards, for a slight competitive vibe if you are into it. Could be a good choice for a let's play or speedrunning.\n\nExtra features are quite convenient and welcomed. You don't get a tutorial, but "advice" based on your actions, reminding you of basic tactics and features if you don't use them. Likewise, you have Iris, a little fairy companion, that will give you general advice and specific details of some aspects of the game (such as terrain penalties) on request. At the end of your quest you get rated on a number of aspects, such as looting and combat, and gives you extra advice or praise if it's bad or good. Your general score awards you "hero points", which you can use to make any new playthrough stronger by unlocking perks, player classes or item storages.\nThis game features a peculiar version of "permadeath", a common roguelike trope, where your character is completely gone after death. You can save your game, but the default would be to start over once you die. However, you can continue a saved game after death, but you aren't awarded hero points if you continue after dying. The game encourages permadeath but doesn't mind very much if you go for the opposite, basically.\n\nYou can't play together with other players, however, it has a fairly interesting approach similar to shared Nethack servers of old, where a single-player game gets peppered with messages and other bonuses caused by other players being in the same "Dimension" (a fancy name for random seeds). As well, special events updated daily give special challenges, such as more experience gain in a harder setting; replacing all item drops for money and so on. Or quests with special NPCs, some fairly funny or endearing.\n6 months after the latest update, special events are still getting rotated daily, which is a good sign.\n\nA great plus is that, while the game isn't available for Linux, it runs flawlessly on WINE, only having a minimal sound glitch with the conversation sound effect (which echoes a tiny bit), but all online features, replays, input, video, music, all other sound effects and such, works perfectly.\n","August 29, 2014","true","38.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game forces you to constantly advance and that really gives the game a very good pacing; the interface isn't clunky which often is the case with more traditional roguelikes, but the game doesn't dumb down anything either.\n\nThe game got an amazing attention to details, and lots of effort has clearly been put into things that most will never notice, but that really makes the game worth replaying over and over against, because you always find new things every time. Clearing the game first looks very simplistic, but once you defeat the demon lord you'll realize that there's far more to the game than you thought.\n\nThe graphics aren't impressive, but they work well for the game, and the artwork can be quite charming at times.","June 8, 2014","true","25.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198008112961/recommended/266210/","76561198008112961","Hetdegon","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198008112961/","74 products in account","Very fun twist on roguelikes, with streamlined and fast-paced gameplay, pleasant music and a highly addictive concept and progression format.\nBasically, this is like a roguelike game (such as Nethack or TOME4: Tales of Maj-Eyal), mixed with one of those old school platformer "scroller" stages where a wall of death is coming towards you. The combination and design makes progression interesting, as gameplay never really stagnates because of the wall keeping you moving forward and requiring you to make decisions. "Is it worth it to enter this dungeon? Will I have a way to get out in time? Can I reach the shopkeeper before the appraiser gets eaten by the darkness?". At the end, you have to battle the boss, the Demon Lord who summoned the wall of death, which packs quite a punch compared to everything else you fight. To aid you, you can find loot, money...all your traditional JRPG elements, but streamlined to be as fast-paced as possible.\n\nThe presentation is a mixed bag. Sprites are tiny but appropriate, and look very much like what you'd expect in a Super NES RPG. Music is not the best ever, but makes itself noticeable when needed, and stays out of the way during the less exciting parts. Controls are very simple and consoley, but doesn't really need a pad to be enjoyed, as it controls with mostly 3 keys and directions. The interface is however quite confusing, with vital stats near the middle of the screen, with other stats at the bottom, buffs at the right...it's a bit all over the place and takes a bit to get used to, but at least you can get used to it after a couple rounds.\nLarger character artwork is also a mixed bag, with some portraits looking good, others looking kinda bland. Character design is very old-school JRPG medieval fantasy, a bit retro while at it, looks more 90s than 2010s if you get what I mean. I guess it is a good effort at looking old-school.\nAs for gameplay decisions, it's all quite slick. Weapons have durability, but are usually easy enough to replace, and repairing is possible, while not straightforward. To compensate, the limit on enchantments, buffs and powerups for each individual weapon or armor is quite big, allowing to kind of craft superweapons with a bit of luck or planning, not too much. Dungeons, terrain and towns are terribly simplistic, but then again, you can't really stay more than a dozen turns in most places, so it works out for the best. There's plenty of decent loot lying around as well, although deciding what stuff to keep and what to drop to satisfy your weight limits can bring the action to a temporary halt as you ponder advantages and disadvantages, or wondering if that unidentified item is crap or highly enchanted.\nAn average game from start to finish can take like 40 minutes. Since it's designed to be played over and over, difficulty is high, and you can store lucky drops for your characters, replay value is pretty good. Specially if you are into beating high scores, a bit of an outdated concept in general, but works pretty well here. Different classes, builds and worlds play quite differently, so there's noticeable variety. Special and shared worlds also have leaderboards, for a slight competitive vibe if you are into it. Could be a good choice for a let's play or speedrunning.\n\nExtra features are quite convenient and welcomed. You don't get a tutorial, but "advice" based on your actions, reminding you of basic tactics and features if you don't use them. Likewise, you have Iris, a little fairy companion, that will give you general advice and specific details of some aspects of the game (such as terrain penalties) on request. At the end of your quest you get rated on a number of aspects, such as looting and combat, and gives you extra advice or praise if it's bad or good. Your general score awards you "hero points", which you can use to make any new playthrough stronger by unlocking perks, player classes or item storages.\nThis game features a peculiar version of "permadeath", a common roguelike trope, where your character is completely gone after death. You can save your game, but the default would be to start over once you die. However, you can continue a saved game after death, but you aren't awarded hero points if you continue after dying. The game encourages permadeath but doesn't mind very much if you go for the opposite, basically.\n\nYou can't play together with other players, however, it has a fairly interesting approach similar to shared Nethack servers of old, where a single-player game gets peppered with messages and other bonuses caused by other players being in the same "Dimension" (a fancy name for random seeds). As well, special events updated daily give special challenges, such as more experience gain in a harder setting; replacing all item drops for money and so on. Or quests with special NPCs, some fairly funny or endearing.\n6 months after the latest update, special events are still getting rotated daily, which is a good sign.\n\nA great plus is that, while the game isn't available for Linux, it runs flawlessly on WINE, only having a minimal sound glitch with the conversation sound effect (which echoes a tiny bit), but all online features, replays, input, video, music, all other sound effects and such, works perfectly.\n","August 29, 2014","true","38.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

One Way Heroics is what you'd expect from any other Rogue-ish game you've played. Turn Based movements, loot of various power/awesomeness and painful difficulty (beyond "afternoon stroll" mode anyways.)\n\nThe twist is theres a wall of darkness comming to murder you (and the whole world) so you are in a constant rush to NOT get scrolled off the screen. This makes entering dungeons and towns something of a race against time when the wall of darkness is on your heels...and every move you make, be it equiping, attacking, talking to npcs, shopping, etc...the wall gets one step closer to you.\n\nThe Story is...well its wierd and certain characters/storylines may either creep some out or not. (me? im good with it)\n\nAlso has multiplayer support and "daily quests" to add some more replay and interestingness.\n\nIf you like Rogue-like/lite games you should like this.\n\nthe price isnt bad either..with and without steam sales behind it","March 3, 2014","true","16.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

A good compromise imo.\n\nWhat I liked\n\nA creative take on this style of game.  I haven't seen anything like it -- the closest comparison would be Shiren the Wanderer.\n\nAn objective (the demon lord) that plagues you from the start, but not impossible to vanquish once you have progressed enough.\n\nParty members that serve a purpose, but also have depth.  Like everything else in the game, they are not permanent.\n\nThe music is fantastic.\n\n\nWhat I didn't like that others might like\n\nI'm not a fan of visual novels (?), so the abundance of text serving as the beginning and end of your adventure is not something that is fulfilling for me.  It's very well written, imo, so I imagine JRPG / Story-reading fans will like this.\n\nNo cursed items.  Unidentified items you can wear, but none of them cursed. :\  The only undiscovered attribute on an item that poses any uncertainty is the durability.\n\nThe price is so low, it feels like I robbed some poor hard-working developer that just loves making games like this.  Playism's site says something about letting you pay what you want (donation-based I guess?), so hopefully some people have been more charitable towards this game.\n\n\nWhat I don't like\n\nThere is no way to isolate the leaderboards to personal social groups - as a result, it's all meaningless information, sadly. :\  It would be great if I could see where I rate among my friends list.\n\nThere's no underground -- Yah, it's a pretty big game already, sure.  But fantasy games need dungeons.  An intricate right-way-progressing dungeon would've made the screen edge much more intimidating.\n\n\nThose are my impressions of this game. :)","March 5, 2014","true","7.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Have to say it's worth far more. I've already spent more time on this game then Dungeons of Dredmor, and can imagine playing it even more.\n\nUnlike most roguelikes, it's fast paced and easy to get into, but becomes complex once you know the basics. I beat easy difficulty on only my second playthrough, which took around 30 minutes. Normal difficulty adds recruitable party members, new items, and removes the fixed end point in easy mode. My longest run lasted 3 hours. I have yet to beat hard\n\nThere are very un-roguelike save points and 'Dimensional Vault' to carry over items from old characters. Your end game rewards are reduced for using them though. If you are good enough at roguelikes to do without them, it's worth trying as there is a lot of stuff to unlock.","March 5, 2014","true","28.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The combination and design makes progression interesting, as gameplay never really stagnates because of the wall keeping you moving forward and requiring you to make decisions. "Is it worth it to enter this dungeon? Will I have a way to get out in time? Can I reach the shopkeeper before the appraiser gets eaten by the darkness?". At the end, you have to battle the boss, the Demon Lord who summoned the wall of death, which packs quite a punch compared to everything else you fight. To aid you, you can find loot, money...all your traditional JRPG elements, but streamlined to be as fast-paced as possible.\n\nThe presentation is a mixed bag. Sprites are tiny but appropriate, and look very much like what you'd expect in a Super NES RPG. Music is not the best ever, but makes itself noticeable when needed, and stays out of the way during the less exciting parts. Controls are very simple and consoley, but doesn't really need a pad to be enjoyed, as it controls with mostly 3 keys and directions. The interface is however quite confusing, with vital stats near the middle of the screen, with other stats at the bottom, buffs at the right...it's a bit all over the place and takes a bit to get used to, but at least you can get used to it after a couple rounds.\nLarger character artwork is also a mixed bag, with some portraits looking good, others looking kinda bland. Character design is very old-school JRPG medieval fantasy, a bit retro while at it, looks more 90s than 2010s if you get what I mean. I guess it is a good effort at looking old-school.\nAs for gameplay decisions, it's all quite slick. Weapons have durability, but are usually easy enough to replace, and repairing is possible, while not straightforward. To compensate, the limit on enchantments, buffs and powerups for each individual weapon or armor is quite big, allowing to kind of craft superweapons with a bit of luck or planning, not too much. Dungeons, terrain and towns are terribly simplistic, but then again, you can't really stay more than a dozen turns in most places, so it works out for the best. There's plenty of decent loot lying around as well, although deciding what stuff to keep and what to drop to satisfy your weight limits can bring the action to a temporary halt as you ponder advantages and disadvantages, or wondering if that unidentified item is crap or highly enchanted.\nAn average game from start to finish can take like 40 minutes. Since it's designed to be played over and over, difficulty is high, and you can store lucky drops for your characters, replay value is pretty good. Specially if you are into beating high scores, a bit of an outdated concept in general, but works pretty well here. Different classes, builds and worlds play quite differently, so there's noticeable variety. Special and shared worlds also have leaderboards, for a slight competitive vibe if you are into it. Could be a good choice for a let's play or speedrunning.\n\nExtra features are quite convenient and welcomed. You don't get a tutorial, but "advice" based on your actions, reminding you of basic tactics and features if you don't use them. Likewise, you have Iris, a little fairy companion, that will give you general advice and specific details of some aspects of the game (such as terrain penalties) on request. At the end of your quest you get rated on a number of aspects, such as looting and combat, and gives you extra advice or praise if it's bad or good. Your general score awards you "hero points", which you can use to make any new playthrough stronger by unlocking perks, player classes or item storages.\nThis game features a peculiar version of "permadeath", a common roguelike trope, where your character is completely gone after death. You can save your game, but the default would be to start over once you die. However, you can continue a saved game after death, but you aren't awarded hero points if you continue after dying. The game encourages permadeath but doesn't mind very much if you go for the opposite, basically.\n\nYou can't play together with other players, however, it has a fairly interesting approach similar to shared Nethack servers of old, where a single-player game gets peppered with messages and other bonuses caused by other players being in the same "Dimension" (a fancy name for random seeds). As well, special events updated daily give special challenges, such as more experience gain in a harder setting; replacing all item drops for money and so on. Or quests with special NPCs, some fairly funny or endearing.\n6 months after the latest update, special events are still getting rotated daily, which is a good sign.\n\nA great plus is that, while the game isn't available for Linux, it runs flawlessly on WINE, only having a minimal sound glitch with the conversation sound effect (which echoes a tiny bit), but all online features, replays, input, video, music, all other sound effects and such, works perfectly.\n","August 29, 2014","true","38.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

More often than not, you will exit the settlement and hear the darkness consuming the NPCs you just chatted to or traded with.\n\nYou generate "Hero Points" during your travel to find the Demon Lord (the endboss), which you can use to unlock more character classes (you can unlock these while playing the game, as well), perks, and, most importantly, unlock/upgrade the "Dimensional Vault" - Here you can stash items the next character you play can profit from, such as a good weapon/armor, rare herbs and other gimmicks that make the playthrough easier.\n\nThe cute(ish) SNES JRPG-style graphics work very well, the soundtrack is excellent and atmospheric, and since this game is built around replayability, there is that, too.\n\nThe online portion is neglectable in my opinion, though there are some neat features such as your death/win message:\nThese get generated at the end and you can pick one from a quite big list, covering generic shout-outs (Like a boss!) to quite specific ones (My trusty Crescent Axe +5 helped me win!). You also meet the ghosts of dead players, which is nice since they even give you EXP boosts and sometimes more when you talk to them.\n\nThere are many more features and "featurettes", I won't go into detail, but as with any good roguelike, there is way more to it than meets the eye.\nTo name just a few: Underlying storyline with meetable / hirable plot characters, a companion system, pets, extensive perk system (this actually kind of works in place of a character generation - you decide what buffs you give your hero), several difficulties...\n\nAlso, apparently a DLC/Expansion is planned (One Way Heroics+), but it is allegedly only readable in japanese at this time, but among other things, there is at least one new class planned.\nSo the game will likely be expanded in the near future.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this for everyone who likes rogue-style games, the price is very modest and you get quite some fun for your money.","August 19, 2014","true","8.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I think it's one of the more overlooked games on Steam which is a shame because it really is good, especially for its price. Basically the game is about you playing the role of the hero, and you have to venture through the land to kill the Demon Lord. You pick your name, class, perks, and start your adventure in a castle full of helpful knights that can give you advice, and also a fairy partner that you bring with you on your adventure to give you advice throughout the game. It won't be easy due to all the wild animals, bandits, monsters, and even the environments, and it's all randomly generated to boot. To top it all off, you absolutely cannot let the black darkness on the left of the screen reach you. Throughout the game the darkness will slowly creep up to you and try to engulf you. Although you move much faster than the darkness itself, doing things like moving through mountains and water, or exploring towns and dungeons for too long will eventually cause the darkness to reach you. The game has a lot of tactics involved as in you have to try and make the most out of the various dungeons you come across, or else you will either get almost nothing out of them or end up dying due to the darkness. Time doesn't move when you're standing still doing nothing, so you can plan out everything. You also have to be very wary of the enemies the game throws at you. If you're not careful and don't take control of the battle, you'll end up finding yourself in a lot of trouble as they are quite strong. Look for various Weapons and Armors you can find because they will most likely be upgrades to your starting equipment. Eventually at 400km the Demon Lord will confront you for a final battle, he has barriers and a lot of HP. Throw everything you can at him, and eventually reinforcements will come to help you. Once you defeat him, you will see the credits, and beat the game...well sort of. See after the end of every run, whether it be due to death or completion, the game will score you on how well you did and you will receive Hero Points. You can use these Hero Points to expand your dimensional vault (A vault where you can store your treasures to use in other runs), unlock new perks and classes etc. This gives the game a ton of replay value as you have to complete the game multiple times to unlock everything. There are some problems I do have with the game, unfortunately. For starters it's quite clunky where you have to manually aim your attacks at enemies and you have to look in the menu to select an ability/item, and your movement speed is quite slow. Fortunately I hear the Plus version which I haven't played yet fixes all of those issues and and adds more content as well. I give the game an 8/10.","August 26, 2015","true","62.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You like persistant unlockables? Buy this game. You like random levels? Buy this game. This is one of my favorite games out there. Its fun to sit and play for 15 mins - or 4 hours straight.\n\nAlso - be happy knowing you're supporting 16-bit style WITHOUT USING RPGMaker. This game runs its own engine.\nThat in and of itself its worth it.\n\n___________________________________________\n\nAt first glance, One Way Heroics looks like it was made on RPGMaker. It wasn't. Its a completely custom engine, from someone in Japan.\n\nAnd, boy is it unique. Seriously. Yes, its an RPG. Yes, it is done in 16 bit style. But that is about the only thing that makes it anything like the RPGs back then.\n\nThe description on the store page really doesn't do it justice. It explains the base game. But it doesn't explain how incredibly addicting it is to go just "one more run".\n\nSee, there's a bunch of dimensions - and they are slowly being swallowed up by the darkness. Meaning you can't go left for too long, as the darkness slowly advances from left to right across the screen every step you take. You are slightly faster than it, though.\n\nThe game is turn based, so like Rogue, everything only moves when you do. Its like Rogue too, in that all you have to do is hit the attack key near an enemy  You are trying to defeat the Demon Lord who's causing the darkness, but its going to be quite a few playthroughs even on the easiest mode to beat him for the first time.\n\nYou will die. A lot. No biggie though as it has permanent unlockables. A "vault" which you can upgrade to store items in. Perks to make your char stronger. And you can either choose to adventure in a completely randomly generated realm, or you can choose one of the "online" realms, 1 of which is random, and the others of which have "specials" (a certain character is there, darkness, better items, more XP etc). The online realms change every 24 hours. There isnt multiplayer as such, however in the online realms, theres a constant scroll of a pic and brief info about each other person playing. You can also set 1 of about 20 "online messages". One of the nicest features of online is you can also encounter the "ghost" of another player in your game at the spot where they died. They help you by giving you an item they were carrying and some of their XP.\n\nTheres also 5 game modes, eacxh slightly harder than the last, but with better items and more story.\n\nOh did I mention that? Theres a story too. Each companion which you can find (and theres quite a few) has a story associated with them you can learn by talking to them. Oh, and both enemies and companions can have "prefixes". Some make them stronger, both enemies and companions. Some change dialogue with companions. (Really, EVERYONE needs to see Naughty Queen Frieda)...\n\nThe base game is I think around $4. Its totally worth it. There's also DLC, which is totally worth it as well, if you like the base game. It adds even more awesomeness.","September 27, 2015","true","60.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Yes. Entertaining? Yes. Cutesy? Yes. Frustrating? Perhaps. Addictive? Most definitely.\n\nOne Way Heroics is a nice little game created in Wolf RPG Editor. When I first played it, I was excited. Games like this always caught my eye and the dialogue the characters/NPC's have only made it more fun. A tad bit silly, but nonetheless still great. So, I started it up and was ready to play. I thought it would be rather simple. It looked easy enough to do; Avoid the darkness consuming the world. In other words, avoid getting scrolled off the screen. I fought monsters along the way. It was very tedious, sure, but entertaining. Then, finally, I encountered the boss, the Demon Lord. I swear, I have never been defeated so quickly by a boss in my entire lifetime.\n\nEager to defeat him, I retried. And thus started the endless cycle of trying to successfully defeat the Demon Lord.\n\nThis game is a bundle of joy, frustration, and addiction. You are provided with numerous classes to choose from and to defeat the Demon Lord with. Each world is randomly generated so there are always new surprises to look forward to. You are also given opportunities to save here and there, so if you are absolutely certain this particular world is suitable for you to achieve your goals, then save at a save point and viola! No need to worry about losing your progress. There are also a number of skills you can obtain, as well as weapons, armor, items, partners - you name it. In addition to the gameplay, the soundtrack is beautiful, enjoyable, and is certainly enough to keep you motivated. Obviously, the graphics are pixelated (with the exception of when character dialogue pops up), but the art is nice and I will admit that I find some of the monsters rather cutesy.\n\nI somehow managed to hop off this game for a while (which was good because if I hadn't, it would've been an unhealthy addiction for me), but I have taken note that the One Way Heroics Plus DLC is coming around Steam sometime soon, so I'll definitely be playing soon again. Do I recommend this game? Of course I do! If you choose to purchase this game, I now wish you all the good luck on your journey to defeat the Demon Lord!","August 11, 2015","true","8.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If they die, you can find their ghosts and get free stuff. Then imagine all this on a auto scroller.\n\nTalking about it really isn't the same as playing it.

Time doesn't move when you're standing still doing nothing, so you can plan out everything. You also have to be very wary of the enemies the game throws at you. If you're not careful and don't take control of the battle, you'll end up finding yourself in a lot of trouble as they are quite strong. Look for various Weapons and Armors you can find because they will most likely be upgrades to your starting equipment. Eventually at 400km the Demon Lord will confront you for a final battle, he has barriers and a lot of HP. Throw everything you can at him, and eventually reinforcements will come to help you. Once you defeat him, you will see the credits, and beat the game...well sort of. See after the end of every run, whether it be due to death or completion, the game will score you on how well you did and you will receive Hero Points. You can use these Hero Points to expand your dimensional vault (A vault where you can store your treasures to use in other runs), unlock new perks and classes etc. This gives the game a ton of replay value as you have to complete the game multiple times to unlock everything. There are some problems I do have with the game, unfortunately. For starters it's quite clunky where you have to manually aim your attacks at enemies and you have to look in the menu to select an ability/item, and your movement speed is quite slow. Fortunately I hear the Plus version which I haven't played yet fixes all of those issues and and adds more content as well. I give the game an 8/10.","August 26, 2015","true","62.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

More often than not, you will exit the settlement and hear the darkness consuming the NPCs you just chatted to or traded with.\n\nYou generate "Hero Points" during your travel to find the Demon Lord (the endboss), which you can use to unlock more character classes (you can unlock these while playing the game, as well), perks, and, most importantly, unlock/upgrade the "Dimensional Vault" - Here you can stash items the next character you play can profit from, such as a good weapon/armor, rare herbs and other gimmicks that make the playthrough easier.\n\nThe cute(ish) SNES JRPG-style graphics work very well, the soundtrack is excellent and atmospheric, and since this game is built around replayability, there is that, too.\n\nThe online portion is neglectable in my opinion, though there are some neat features such as your death/win message:\nThese get generated at the end and you can pick one from a quite big list, covering generic shout-outs (Like a boss!) to quite specific ones (My trusty Crescent Axe +5 helped me win!). You also meet the ghosts of dead players, which is nice since they even give you EXP boosts and sometimes more when you talk to them.\n\nThere are many more features and "featurettes", I won't go into detail, but as with any good roguelike, there is way more to it than meets the eye.\nTo name just a few: Underlying storyline with meetable / hirable plot characters, a companion system, pets, extensive perk system (this actually kind of works in place of a character generation - you decide what buffs you give your hero), several difficulties...\n\nAlso, apparently a DLC/Expansion is planned (One Way Heroics+), but it is allegedly only readable in japanese at this time, but among other things, there is at least one new class planned.\nSo the game will likely be expanded in the near future.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this for everyone who likes rogue-style games, the price is very modest and you get quite some fun for your money.","August 19, 2014","true","8.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You like persistant unlockables? Buy this game. You like random levels? Buy this game. This is one of my favorite games out there. Its fun to sit and play for 15 mins - or 4 hours straight.\n\nAlso - be happy knowing you're supporting 16-bit style WITHOUT USING RPGMaker. This game runs its own engine.\nThat in and of itself its worth it.\n\n___________________________________________\n\nAt first glance, One Way Heroics looks like it was made on RPGMaker. It wasn't. Its a completely custom engine, from someone in Japan.\n\nAnd, boy is it unique. Seriously. Yes, its an RPG. Yes, it is done in 16 bit style. But that is about the only thing that makes it anything like the RPGs back then.\n\nThe description on the store page really doesn't do it justice. It explains the base game. But it doesn't explain how incredibly addicting it is to go just "one more run".\n\nSee, there's a bunch of dimensions - and they are slowly being swallowed up by the darkness. Meaning you can't go left for too long, as the darkness slowly advances from left to right across the screen every step you take. You are slightly faster than it, though.\n\nThe game is turn based, so like Rogue, everything only moves when you do. Its like Rogue too, in that all you have to do is hit the attack key near an enemy  You are trying to defeat the Demon Lord who's causing the darkness, but its going to be quite a few playthroughs even on the easiest mode to beat him for the first time.\n\nYou will die. A lot. No biggie though as it has permanent unlockables. A "vault" which you can upgrade to store items in. Perks to make your char stronger. And you can either choose to adventure in a completely randomly generated realm, or you can choose one of the "online" realms, 1 of which is random, and the others of which have "specials" (a certain character is there, darkness, better items, more XP etc). The online realms change every 24 hours. There isnt multiplayer as such, however in the online realms, theres a constant scroll of a pic and brief info about each other person playing. You can also set 1 of about 20 "online messages". One of the nicest features of online is you can also encounter the "ghost" of another player in your game at the spot where they died. They help you by giving you an item they were carrying and some of their XP.\n\nTheres also 5 game modes, eacxh slightly harder than the last, but with better items and more story.\n\nOh did I mention that? Theres a story too. Each companion which you can find (and theres quite a few) has a story associated with them you can learn by talking to them. Oh, and both enemies and companions can have "prefixes". Some make them stronger, both enemies and companions. Some change dialogue with companions. (Really, EVERYONE needs to see Naughty Queen Frieda)...\n\nThe base game is I think around $4. Its totally worth it. There's also DLC, which is totally worth it as well, if you like the base game. It adds even more awesomeness.","September 27, 2015","true","60.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay is kinda unique for me, you must keep walking to the right side before the darkness chase you(I feel sorry to the town peoples, they're screaming and die ;_;) while looting and fighting, so you must use your turn wisely because this game is turn-based.

But the learning curve is a bit on the steep side. Best advice i can give right now (still so nubbish @ this game) Get a vault and put all ur items in it if you can when your about to die. Super fun even though when you die you lose that char and have to start over. (Again your items can stay if you put them in a vault, This seems to be the key) You can go to a world thats sole purpose is to get money and items.. Stack those items and store them when you die. Will give your other games an easier start. It seems very in depth as far as different classes and items. With the darkness closeing in on you. It makes you have to think about every move and action.. Well worth the price I paid, very excellent game for under a buck.

The system for gear statistics is pretty straightforward, as is the story-telling, as is leveling up. There are no skill trees or any choice of what stat you level up, but I promise you it won't matter.\nThat being said, the simplicity is nice. It allows you to play the game casually without taking away that constant strive some players have for better gear or "the perfect run".\n\nThe combat is also quite simple. You have a basic attack you will use most of the time, as well as a few abilities learned from leveling or NPC's. It's quick, with you likely not spending more than 5 seconds on most enemies besides bosses. It keeps the game moving, which is nice because in a roguelike its important not to drag things out. This also allows you to keep the game short if that's what you want. Personally my average session is maybe 2 hours long, but if you insist on going as far as 2000km (which isn't neccessary to win), it's a bit closer to 4 or 5 hours. Optional saves make those long games far less daunting.\n\nAs I said, this game can work for casual players, but it does not leave the more dedicated players with nothing to do. 170 hours as I'm writing this review and there is still more to do. The game has a few interesting objectives woven into it to DRASTICALLY increase replay value, such as daily campaigns that change up the rules of the procedurally generated worlds you play in, multiple bosses to defeat, 4-5 different difficulties and 4 different ways to "win" a playthrough. Also it has one particular aspect I love to see in roguelikes; you can transfer a limited amount of gear from one playthrough to another. This helps you to continue your quest for the absolute best gear by allowing you to keep enchanting gear instead of losing everything at the end of a playthrough. But it's not at all essential for beating the game if that's too easy for you ;)\n\nAs for the "One Way Heroics Plus" expansion (without going into detail), it's not neccessary for enjoying the game. It's the icing on top of the cake, and the odds are you will want it at some point or another, so I suggest buying it right off the bat to really enhance the game.\n\nWhether you are looking for a game to waste a few hours on, or one to get really sucked into, you just can't go wrong with One Way Heroics.","March 4","true","174.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While AAA developers stick to doing what they know will make money (sequel after sequel, FPSs, etc.), indie developers are more often willing to take risks on new ideas. Sure, you still get plenty of repetition out of the indie scene (side scrolling platformers, RPG Maker RPGs, roguelike elements, retro visuals, zombies, etc.) but I think that their overall percentage of innovative games brought to market is higher. Oddly enough, One Way Heroics features all the examples I listed in parentheses for repetition except for platforming, yet it still goes down as an innovative game in my book.\n\nIn order for you to be successful in One Way Heroics, every action you take requires that you be mindful of the ever encroaching darkness on the left side of the screen. It's such a simple concept and yet it has such a profound effect on the entirety of the game. I particularly appreciated how it forced a fast pace to the game (an extremely uncommon trait in RPGs) and demanded strategic thinking. Both of these play into a relatively harsh learning curve. My first attempt ended very early on yet I was quickly able to restart and learn from my mistakes. This isn't an exceedingly deep game so the learning curve relaxes after the first few hours. That said, between the 8 classes, a variety of perks you can choose from, and 4 difficulty levels, there are enough new things to try to keep your interest.\n\nIt's when you look outside of the gameplay that One Way Heroics comes up short. Its visuals, while not offensively bad, are very generic and bland. The music is a little better but equally generic. I'm still not entirely sure what to make of the story. It's odd because so much of it is worked into the game like an optional sidequest or rare, chance encounter. There were several moments that I enjoyed but the terrible English translation, silly anime character tropes, and high degree of difficulty in even accessing the story put a major damper on this aspect of the game. Despite 33 hours played I only ever encountered one of five NPC characters that you can have join your party and hear their story. The only reasons I can think of to have that level of rarity are a misguided attempt to elongate replayability or an MMO inspired reward for dedicated players. This is an excellent point to lead into my summary: One Way Heroics has a solid gameplay concept at its foundation but is surrounded by otherwise amateurish game design.","September 30, 2014","true","33.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

After your first attempt and death you are awarded with hero point and you can use these to buy mor dimensional vault slots and perks that you can use for the next attempt. Becuase of this every playthrough becomes valuable as you have to try you best every time to get good stuff and even though you may fail at beating the boss at that atempt the stuff you gathered can be stored in the dimensional vault and be withrawn at the start of the next game.\n\nThe game itself can be a little bit disappointing when you walk around and see a house or dungeon way too many steps away and you see it disappearing in the shadow every step you take, but be sure that there's going to be way more epic loot ahead. And if you are really obssesed with entering precisly that house you can reload the same world with the next charachter if you want to do so.\n\nPersonally i find the Pirate class to be the best one. Yeah he may have negative charisma making the villagers hate his face, but after adding 2 charisma+ perks everything is fine. Be aware that you have to unlock him though but it is way worth it.\n\nanyway a great game and seems like something i will come back to now and then whenever i have hard time finding a game to play in my steam library containing 74 games....","March 11, 2015","true","14.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Plays quickly and satisfyingly and gives a new random dimension every day to challenge a leaderboard for, as well as other challenge modes and random modes to do for fun. Combat is simple but there's a decent amount of classes, perks, gear, and items to find, as well a sparty members to recruit that come with mini storylines to complete. You can also save items from previous runs to hand them forward down the line.\n\n\nThe game forces you to continually press ahead or die to "the Darkness", so exploring and fighting is balanced with continuing onward, ever onward. Everything you do takes up a turn, so exploring a dungeon and hacking down chests takes time, and you need to make sure you've got time to get out of the dungeon you went into! Or break a hole in the wall.\n\nAt under 5 bucks, the game is a steal if you're looking for a small, simple game to play bits at a time. You can get in a game before work, or at lunchtime, or etc. You can play for a lot, lot longer at a time if you want to! But the game's strength is its ability to deliver a full package run in about a half hour.","April 27, 2015","true","10.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Let me give you a summary\n\nThis 2D Rogue-like RPG puts you in a world where the end is on it's way, and it is close! Every step that you make, every action that you do, will cause the end to draw closer and closer.\nWith dungeons, towns, npcs, monsters, holy items and companions spread all over the place, it quickly becomes a game where you have to think how much you can risk for opening that one chest that might give you a great item.\n\nThe first time you will complete the game will be in about your first hour of play ( getting to the end isn't that hard on the easiest difficulty) but with daily challenges, increased difficulty maps, secret endings (that i won't spoil) and a ton of classes to complete the game with. You will find yourself a new challenge almost every single day.\n\nThe game plays good, has controller support, has a good learning curve, and it makes you feel like a real hero when you accomplish something.\n\nThe cons?\nWell if you don't like dying a lot, then this is not the game for you. One mistake or wrong decision can get you trapped and sometimes the game will be unfair to you.\nSometimes you will see the game paused with the message "loading map" which is a slight setback in pace.\nClasses are a little bit unbalanced (in my opinion this only adds more challenge for those willing to take the risk)\nMaybe if you are really looking for a complex story in a game this might be a let down. (You are the hero, save the day, thats about it)\nBut that is right about it for the Cons.\n\nIn short, while I only have 9 hours currently into the game, it feels like it has been minutes.\nIf you are looking for a cheap game that is worth the price, and that will consume your time like there is no tomorrow, you will not be disappointed with One Way Heroics.","May 21, 2015","true","12.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

On paper, the concept sounds forced and confusing, but the game plays intuitively after only a few lives. Most importantly, there is a great design sense that unifies the game as a whole. Each class encourages its own gameplay style, and character customization, through an unlock system, is flexible without being overwhelming. An inter-game treasure chest, like that in Shiren / Mystery Dungeon, allows players not used to roguelikes accumulate treasure without being able to horde it. Well worth the price: a game that is rewarding whether you invest hours into it or simply play it as a coffee-break roguelike.","November 23, 2014","true","52.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

And I hate challenging games, but this one is great! 9.5/10.  Here are pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n\n- Great game, great balancing.\n\n- Level system is nice.\n\n- The stamina and stuff gives is a nice addition.\n\n- I've never seen another RPG game like this, so thats great! Making a new idea is always nice!\n\n- Whatever else I think is nice.\n\nCons:\n\n- Lack of multiplayer, it would make the game a bit better in my option, give it that and you get my 10/10.\n\n- Co-op would be cool too.\n\n- Lack of classes, so far i've only found 5. I dont know how many there are, but still\n\n- It should be completely new. They should make new classes that no one has ever seen, that'd be nice. There are the basics like Archer, Swordfighter/Warrior. Sure, all RPGs have that, but this one would be better without, because this game is a one of a kind, I dont think any other RPG game like this could top it. I have a few new class ideas in mind, like the Warage. It'd use a combination of wands, spellbooks and swords and shields. I think that'd be nice. This game should have stuff like that. Also, you can use my idea if you want.\n\n- Finally, not much in the game itself. It gets repeatitive and boring really fast. Adding like Daily Challenges, Missions you could do like "Go 500 meters in 20 seconds" or something would be great. Also adding something like a Christmas mode at the appropriate time each year, it'd bring in the holiday cheer! :D\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverall, One Way Heroics is a great buy.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doxhox/recommended/266210/","doxhox","Dox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doxhox/","234 products in account","I got this game in the Humble Weeaboo Bundle that was running some time ago. You see, I was thinking "hurr durr all those games have steam cards yay free games for me," without actually considering if they would be fun. Frankly, I didn't expect any of them to be fun for longer than maybe half an hour.\n\nAnd boy was I wrong.\n\n>>SOUNDS AND MENUS AND PRACTICAL THINGS AND STUFF<<\nWhen I started it up, I was greeted by the typical low-resolution menu screen that reminded me of some fond childhood memories with my mother. I would be playing on the couch with my gameboy, sound on, and after a while my mother would express her annoyence of this sound by imitating them with considerable volume. The sounds that engulfed me from my speakers when I started the game and saw the menu were the kind of sounds my mother would so fondly imitate to me with her loud loving voice.\n\nAlready almost teary-eyed I pushed the button on my controller - which works flawlessly with this game - to begin a new adventure.\n\nAgain, I saw a screen pop up in front of me which reminded me of home, of my mother. You see, I had to pick a name. And it so happens that my mother gave me my name. Hence, the memories. I felt the tears forming in my eyes again.\n\nAside from picking a name, I also had to choose a class and several perks. My choice for a class was somewhat limited at first, as I could only choose between two classes. This, however, did not discourage me. For it seemed to me that there would be many opportunities for unlockable characters. And who doesn't love unlockable characters? Gleeful at the prospect of being able to unlock things I picked a class at random, after which I proceeded to put all of my perk slots into extra strength. I would need it.\n\nMy heart leapt with excitement as I pushed the button that would initiate my adventure.\n\nAnother screen popped up: the final portal that would bring me to the different universe that I had been waiting for. All I had yet to do was choose which universe this would be. A multitude of opportunites (i.e. more or less 7) appeared before my eyes. And once more, childhood memories filled my mind. Of my mother, who would with a kind smile let me pick out my own clothes, and then get mad at me for not being able to pick anything good. Tears streaming from my eyes I went for the option that my mother would have chosen. The randomly generated world.\n\nAnother two pushes on the button (one for picking the world, a second one for picking the difficulty), and I finally arrived.\n\n>>STORY<<\nI was a hero, and I was greeted by noble king Victor. I was told of a terrible fate to befall these lands. Of darkness, doom, and despair. Of the impending danger that was right behind me. Quite literally. And I would be the one to stop its merciless assault on these former peaceful lands.\n\nAnd so I embarked on my quest. The darkness ever licking at my heels. Again, quite literally.\n\nI noticed that I also had gained help, in the form of an artificial fairy called Iris. She seemed to be there for all the questions I had, which were none as the blood of heroes had been passed down to me from my mother and hence I did not need any help. I blinked away a tear.\n\n>>GAMEPLAY<<\nI rushed through the lands, never resting. Every step I took seemed to take at least 5 minutes. And every step I took seemed to make the many monsters that roamed the lands take one step closer to me as well.\n\nBut I couldn't dally and dance with these fiends for long. With every action of mine the darkness crept closer. I knew that it would be my end should it reach me. So I continued, slashing through waves and waves of demons and monsters as fast as I could.\n\nOn the way, I met many different innocent people. They would offer me their help in exchange for the money I came across on my journey. It was a sad business they practiced. As much as I would have wanted to, there was no way I could save them from the darkness that was creeping towards us. Merely moments after I had finished bartering with them, I would hear their dying screams coming from behind me. From inside the darkness, where they met an untimely demise. With my money.\n\n>>REPLAY VALUE<<\nTen minutes in my adventure I died. Like my mother.\n\nNah just kidding, she's still alive and kickin'.\nI did die though.\n\nBut my death did not discourage me. I had learned from my failures and had become stronger through them. And I knew that I would keep standing up each time I fell down. And I would keep growing stronger, and stronger, and stronger.\n\nAnd at last, I would make it. I would defeat the big evil boss, and peace would return the world!\n\nBut, would it be enough?\n\nThere were many other similar worlds. Like EWGHF, or QWUIHNAJ, or HHSJHEUI, or any other world that seemed to have gotten their names from some deity ramming his head on his keyboard several times.\n\nEach and every single one of them needed the help of someone.\n\nAnd that someone would be me. A hero.\n\nA hero, like my mother.\n\n\n\n;_;7","August 14, 2014","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

This is very great for the price, even when discounted. The price looks like it's already discounted! Worth more than 3.49. Also very good for trading card sellers like me, who sell every card they get (although I couldn't have bought this without a couple of vintage items on TF2). Not to mention, that IT WAS 85 CENTS on summer sale! The most fun part is that you get to pick your own characters, random generated maps (I love rogue-likes' and random generated everything), and with online support, you can get help from ghosts of other dead people that have tried to beat demon1656 (See what i did there >:D sorry, just had to do it). Nevertheless, the main part of the game is about the darkness, I think the darkness is pretty paced for what it does. Sure it can get behind your back when your swimming (unless you get the perk, yes i forgot to mention perks, and lots of them), or climbing through moutains, or getting trolled by some skeleton in a slim dungeon. Another cool little thing is the Dimensional Vault. When you die/beat the demon1656 you get to store items from your inventory and use them for the next adventure. You can choose not to and get recognition if you beat youknowwho xD.\n\n\nIf I would score it, I would give it a winRAR/winRAR","June 30, 2014","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you are a fan of JRPGs or loot snagging in general, you'll have a great time.\n\nDespite this being a procedurally generated roguelike game, it does manage to squeeze in some story and interesting characters. The unique bit is that, the generation is based off of whatever you want to type in. If you die in the dimension you entered if you want to revisit that dimension, the map generated will be the same (from what I've seen). This means that you can try to learn aspects of a specific dimension and plan around it.\n\nDon't worry about the random generation screwing you over too hard either. On each character run you are always given 15 free turns that you can use in bundles of 3 whenever you want. So if you see a long stretch of unavoidable mountains, you could in theory use all 15 turns to pass them if it was really that bad/unavoidable.\n\nThe combat is simplistic, but deep enough that strategy actually matters since your positioning will often determine the outcome of a fight if more than one opponent is present. The game has a fair number of weapons and weapon types, some of which offer longer ranges and others which are really great at busting down terrain (Yes, you can break down walls of a house to talk to the people inside).\n\nIf you love optimization, NPC party building, pretending you actually have friends or are just looking for a fun game with a wonderful soundtrack, I'd spend the 83 cents to play this. I believe the regular asking price is $3, which is more than fair. Had I not only found this thanks to the steam sale, I would have gladly paid the $3.","July 3, 2014","true","50.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With the very retro RPG look, and the handling of an old school adventure RPG, it's already got a lot going for it.\n\nThe game play is basically a "Run from the wall of death" style game reminicent of old side scrollers, where if the Death Wall (the Darkness in this case) gets you, you die, while at the same time, all of your resources are limited and nothing is infinite.  This makes the game heavy on the two major elements of game play:  Risk/Reward and Resourse Management.  Do I want to venture into that dungeon?  Will I get more out of it then I use to go in?  Will I die?\n\nThe other big element of gameplay is multiple play throughs.  You do a dimention, and either win or die.  All characters are "one and done."  On each subsequent play through, you make new characters, allowing you knowledge of what your characters are good and bad at, and giving you control over HOW you'll play each adventure.  After each adventure, you get points that you can use to unlock stronger abilities (perks), new classes, and expand the "Dimentional Box" which allows you to carry a limited number of items over to new adventures, or to merely store them for future difficult adventures.\n\nThe final big element of the game is the randomly genereated dimentions.  Each play through you can go to a new random dimention (with differing base parameters), replay old dimentions (same base parameters but different world layout), or do any of the current special dimentions with descriptions of what's special about them.  Alternately, you can input dimention codes manually to have a similar experience as friends, to find dimentions that spawn things you might want (finding codes online), or just to do your own variety of random.\n\nPros:\n- That price!\n- Lots of replay value\n- Enough customization options\n- Very rewarding gameplay\n\nCons:\n- Some dimentions can be surprisingly difficult even on the easiest mode\n- Can be grind intensive\n\nTips:\n- I have a coveted "Lumberjack Battleaxe" which is just the best at breaking walls.\n- Nice easy dimention:  RVOFGTKI","July 4, 2014","true","30.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Take a very basic turn based movement and combat system, simplified stats and gear usage, and rather basic 'save the world' story as their parts, and this isn't anything new nor special by any degree, yet once you add in the ever moving 'Darkness', a mass of black that's always moving ahead, with or without you activly running away from it, and it suddenly becomes this odd pressured race of time and land management.\n\nThe main key point is whever you take an actions, yet it be attack or talking or even moving, the darkness moves a bit as well, devouring that part of the map with it making it no longger accessible. Suddenly you might be trying to rush towards a small city outpost hoping to sell your overload of loot, only to get there to watch the vender NPC's parish in that very second, having to now make a rush forward hoping another isn't too far off. It suddenly makes every little action you do feel 'importent' in the grand scale of things, and it really forces you to learn to look out for selective map alterations, or carry around Map Scrolls to ensure you don't miss anything vital. The NPC's you can recrute as well also have  rather small, but kinda interesting storylines, each one giving a bit more clear overarching idea of just what's going on, and perhaps a way to really 'save the world'. Not to ruin anything, but those who explore and read up will chances are find far more then this game first lets on.\n\nOn top of all of this, is a small, but nifty option of online interactions. It's nothing Dark Souls worthy of jolly co-op and the like, but it's more say little snapshots into other's current playing situations as they trek on the same world, able to share a small snipit of text, and be shown how they are status wise. Of course, on death, you can also share something much the same, and depending on where you died, your ghost might help someone else's journey along, dropping a random peice of loot you had at the moment. Beyond all of that, it's a nice, addicting, and simple game you can pick up for an hour or two, feel like you've made some progress, and seems to always have just ONE more little thing to show you even many hours after the fact.","July 7, 2014","true","40.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is one of those games that doesn't have a lot of mechanics, but it does what it does, and it does it very well. I don't reccomend playing with a controller, since the default controls are using the control stick to move. And since your character moves in four directions, it's quite difficult to position yourself. The gameplay is a sort of turn-based. The only way I can describe it is if you played games like Dungeons of Dreadmor where each time you move, the enemies (and darkness) move after you move. The graphics are also pretty good. I'm not sure if this game is made in RPG maker, but it does have similar graphics, like the mountains.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lackies/recommended/266210/","Lackies","Zyke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lackies/","193 products in account","One Way Heroics is an excellent game, let alone for the price.\n\nI found it to have one of the smoothest learning curves for rogue-lites/likes. So you can make progress and beat it on an easy difficult consistently with a little practice. And if you can't you can either change your seed for a fresh run, OR practice your current seed and learn where the helpful locations/items are to progress further each time, or maybe store items for that leg up on the next run.\n\nThe classes all have a good variety in their bonuses, and while I found the swordsman and Hero easy to make overpowered there's plenty of success and strategy to be had with other classes. The perk system also helps you further optimize or offset weaknesses.\n\nThe game even accomdates further in that you can beat the demon lord in a quick 30 minute journey or invest in a 3-5 hour hike to the end of the world. You can even save and come back to journey after a break (or a series of poor decisions).\n\nMy rather nitpicky complaint is that the humor is a little immature/pervy, but overall harmless. And that I feel ultimately this game doesn't have quite the staying power of say Binding of Issac or FTL.  This is primarily due to the weapons all feeling very same-y, and there being little  mechanical skill in this game (i.e. if you take your time you should never input an unintended command). The music is also not quite as good as those other games.\n\nThat said this game scratches a similiar but different itch from those games and even if you only get 20 hours out of the game they will be 20 hours you won't regret, and stuff like daily events and the hardest difficulties could potentially get you many more past that.","August 12, 2014","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lipucd/recommended/266210/","lipucd","Lipucd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lipucd/","381 products in account","It's really interesting how a very simple concept can make something highly engrossing, and One Way Heroics is a good example of this in play. Take a very basic turn based movement and combat system, simplified stats and gear usage, and rather basic 'save the world' story as their parts, and this isn't anything new nor special by any degree, yet once you add in the ever moving 'Darkness', a mass of black that's always moving ahead, with or without you activly running away from it, and it suddenly becomes this odd pressured race of time and land management.\n\nThe main key point is whever you take an actions, yet it be attack or talking or even moving, the darkness moves a bit as well, devouring that part of the map with it making it no longger accessible. Suddenly you might be trying to rush towards a small city outpost hoping to sell your overload of loot, only to get there to watch the vender NPC's parish in that very second, having to now make a rush forward hoping another isn't too far off. It suddenly makes every little action you do feel 'importent' in the grand scale of things, and it really forces you to learn to look out for selective map alterations, or carry around Map Scrolls to ensure you don't miss anything vital. The NPC's you can recrute as well also have  rather small, but kinda interesting storylines, each one giving a bit more clear overarching idea of just what's going on, and perhaps a way to really 'save the world'. Not to ruin anything, but those who explore and read up will chances are find far more then this game first lets on.\n\nOn top of all of this, is a small, but nifty option of online interactions. It's nothing Dark Souls worthy of jolly co-op and the like, but it's more say little snapshots into other's current playing situations as they trek on the same world, able to share a small snipit of text, and be shown how they are status wise. Of course, on death, you can also share something much the same, and depending on where you died, your ghost might help someone else's journey along, dropping a random peice of loot you had at the moment. Beyond all of that, it's a nice, addicting, and simple game you can pick up for an hour or two, feel like you've made some progress, and seems to always have just ONE more little thing to show you even many hours after the fact.","July 7, 2014","true","40.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If this statment puts a bad taste in your mouth, then this game is not for you. However, if what I just said doesn't bother you at all, then you just might have found a gem worth keeping.\nThis game is a rougelike, so don't expect to have all the pieces of the puzzle when you first begin. (Google "Rougelike" if you don't know what that term means, trust me it helps.) Your first dozen (or few dozen, depending on your luck) playthroughs are more than likely going to end in failure, and the world will be doomed without you. However, as you discover strategies that work (and ones that don't) things will start to turn around. Still, odds are you will die more times than you will reach that happy ending. But that's the thing, the game doesn't stop at the ending. Multiple endings add to replay value, as do multiple objectives that you don't even know exist when the game begins. Add in the fact that worlds are randomly generated, and you will never have two playthroughs that are quite the same (aside from multiple deaths, as that is always a possibility).\nIn short, this game will give you back everything that you put into it. If you don't give it a chance, you will have wasted your money. Fight through the first dozen deaths and learn from your mistakes, and this game will leave you addicted like it has done for me.","June 29, 2014","true","57.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Toxyclean/recommended/266210/","Toxyclean","DSK Xiphon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Toxyclean/","363 products in account","This is one of the many extremely cheap games I got during the Summer Sales (2014).  I got it simply because I knew the trading cards would make up or at least almost make up for the 74 cents I spent.  I launched it, and was ready to let it sit and run for cards, but then, the music started.  The music was wonderful to listen to.  After sitting on the menu just listening to the music for about 30-/+ minutes, I decided I'd actually give the game a try.\n\nI see a menu allowing me to choose my name, class, and additional perks.  Each of the characters has different standard perks, abilities, and gear.  Though it looks like you're going in extremely weak, you get random perks for leveling up and for exchanging levels with the Goddess statues that you find throughout the worlds.  If you choose the right combination of perks for a class, you can be very well set late-game.\n\nThe mechanics are simple; Z to attack, X to open the inventory menu, and C to open the grid view so you can aim without moving your character.  You progress to the right of the screen to escape the darkness that's consuming the land.  If you touch the left end of the screen, you die.  There's a boss to fight, and if you kill him, you win (though you will not kill him without leveled gear and good stats).  You can climb mountains and swim in water in exchange for turns and stamina.  You find items scattered about, there are merchants, dungeons, and random villages (of which usually have a person that allows you to save your progress).  It's pretty much a standard turn-based exploration RPG, but is very clever in which they execute certain aspects.\n\nThe first game I thought of while playing this game was one of my favorites for the GBA- Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team.  The moving mechanics, the menus, the navigation, and the soundtrack all are similar, and very well executed.  This game renewed the genre for me.\n\nWhy I Recommend It:\n\n-The game has a very high replay value due to the randomly generated worlds and limitless perk combinations.\n-The game is very cheap, and is well worth the money.\n-The soundtrack alone is worth the cost of the game.  The game is almost just a bonus.\n-It's very well set up, with little to no bugs (I have yet to find one)\n\nWho I Recommend It To:\n\n-People wanting to experience another classic RPG with a twist.\n-People that enjoyed the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series and games similar to it.\n-People with limited funds.\n-People that just want a game to play that is unlike many of the games here on Steam.\n\nWho Should Avoid It?:\n\n-People unwilling to pay the minute price.\n-Idiots.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nI didn't think I'd invest as much time in it as I have.  This isn't one of those games you usually invest a lot of time in for straight playthrough (say, 5 hour+ sessions), though you can.  This is one of those games you would play for thirty minutes a day everyday.  Personally speaking, I'll certainly be coming back to it.","July 1, 2014","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And quite frankly it feels like I'm robbing the developers. I've been pretty hooked the last few days on it and expect to push through until I get full completion.\n\nIt is a rogue-like game, meaning that it has perma death and randomly generated worlds. You make a character, you pick from some classes and perks, and you push that character as far as it can go. A darkness on the left side of the screen keeps you moving ever forward in your attempt to get as much gear and power before your inevitable death or the death of the endboss. When you die, you gain some points that you can use to unlock more bonuses to choose from and slowly amass a constant storage between characters so you can save some epic items.\n\nThere is no real multiplayer other than a Dark Souls-like feature where you encounter the ghosts of players on the same server that benefit you slightly and that you can compete with.\n\nThe sound is cute and retro, nothing astounding. The visuals are about Final Fantasy 1 quality but are pretty enough to get you through. The gameplay really hooks me. For some people, you will spend many hours through many characters striving to do better and unlock everything. For others, you'll play for an hour or two.

This is very great for the price, even when discounted. The price looks like it's already discounted! Worth more than 3.49. Also very good for trading card sellers like me, who sell every card they get (although I couldn't have bought this without a couple of vintage items on TF2). Not to mention, that IT WAS 85 CENTS on summer sale! The most fun part is that you get to pick your own characters, random generated maps (I love rogue-likes' and random generated everything), and with online support, you can get help from ghosts of other dead people that have tried to beat demon1656 (See what i did there >:D sorry, just had to do it). Nevertheless, the main part of the game is about the darkness, I think the darkness is pretty paced for what it does. Sure it can get behind your back when your swimming (unless you get the perk, yes i forgot to mention perks, and lots of them), or climbing through moutains, or getting trolled by some skeleton in a slim dungeon. Another cool little thing is the Dimensional Vault. When you die/beat the demon1656 you get to store items from your inventory and use them for the next adventure.

This game is amazing. I know i only have 5 hours (Give or take a little) put into the game. But it is really really good. I found myself sitting and playing for 2 hours straight when i just wanted to see what it looked like. It's a bit tricky to start with for your first go. But it is really fun. And the price. It's well worth the price. Especially if you bought it on the Steam Sale for $0.87. I suggest you get this game. I have no idea on how to make a review. But i'll just say that this game is f***ing amazing. Go get it and stop reading this terrible review.","July 1, 2014","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One Way Heroics is probably one of the better indie games this year that you won't hear about.\n\nIf you enjoy generated games or the old school sprite RPG's, get this, get it now.\n\nThe game-play is pseudo-turn-based where every time the player performs an action, the game world will iterate as well.\n\nPros: Excellent replay value.\nNice sprite visuals\nFun, Simple gameplay: Run right, adventure, fight or flee from a large variety of monsters, search for supplies. Visit towns and talk to NPCS.\nDo all of the above while impending doom is always advancing towards you.\nDue to generated content, you never know what you'll encounter.  Each new adventure has its surprises.\nLots of secrets to uncover.\nWorks with gamepads other than the Xbox360 Controller.\nAble to carry some equipment over to a new adventure.Cons: None.  Although you need to come into this game expecting to replay it repeatedly to really get anything out of it.  Not a traditional linear RPG at all.\nOne of my favorite indie games for 2014.","September 23, 2014","true","32.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If so then this game is a very prospective find for your collection! It's a very perma death and turn based unforgiving type game but of course it has features that work around that kind of system, being able to bring items over from previous gameplays and also unlocking new classes and perks to make yourself stronger at the beginning. The pace it sets with the darkness constantly chasing you is very fresh as well because not only is it a roguelike game but it also has aspects of time management almost like Half Minute Hero, making gameplay have a much more frantic pace even though it's still turn based. Another thing that makes the game fun to play is the online features, it's always fun playing a game and knowing others are doing the same, the little pop in messages aren't disruptive at all and seeing how far other people are reaching and how many other people are failing is fun in it's own rights. Of course, it's got the sharing aspect from games like Minecraft and Starbound, you can share any of the worlds that have been generated by simply giving the world's code to friends and other people. All the worlds have their own little leaderboards too, with rankings and other things, you can even see how people went about their adventure. Also, you can actually get better at a world/dimension since it's layout never changes aside from random loot drops and events. Overall, while simplistic and a bit more on the hectic/rushed side, it's still pretty in depth, especially with the carryovers and whatnot, you can even grind items out to twink yourself up for the next run. As an ending note, don't expect to win early on unless you play on the easiest difficulty, losses are inevitable on this game as they are a part of it, take it in as it comes and build yourself up to become stronger to finally defeat the Demon Lord!","March 1, 2014","true","51.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sure, there are the usual suspects, such as stats, leveling, items, monsters and even a final boss. But that is where the similarities end. Each game is a race against the clock where the encroaching darkness at the left of the screen advances while your heroic character must scramble right in search of experience, items, gold and helpful npc's.\n\nSound fun so far? It gets better, not only is the difficulty brutally hard and the classes vary in play style, but each world you play in is randomly determined at the start of a game. You can keep the names of these worlds and re-enter them to go back to the same world as before, yet even then the experiences are fresh enough to ensure replayability of the highest caliber.\nLike in Rogue Legacy, death is not the end of your efforts. Choosing a new class, and storing items in the dimensional vault makes the next game a little less harrowing if you choose. You can use the Hero points, awarded at the end of the game to unlock more classes and perks.\n\nThat being said, I was not kidding when I mentioned the brutal difficulty. In addition to powerful enemies, you might not have the best equipment because merchants do not appear often and you might not have cash at hand then. Or they appear often, but sell basic articles. And if you find a legendary sword? Use it sparingly as all equipment has a lifebar of such, if it runs out they break. Unless you have awesome perks and have gained levels at a crazy rate you can't beat the Demon Lord naked and unarmed.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is truly one that gives great bang for so few bucks.

Take a very basic turn based movement and combat system, simplified stats and gear usage, and rather basic 'save the world' story as their parts, and this isn't anything new nor special by any degree, yet once you add in the ever moving 'Darkness', a mass of black that's always moving ahead, with or without you activly running away from it, and it suddenly becomes this odd pressured race of time and land management.\n\nThe main key point is whever you take an actions, yet it be attack or talking or even moving, the darkness moves a bit as well, devouring that part of the map with it making it no longger accessible. Suddenly you might be trying to rush towards a small city outpost hoping to sell your overload of loot, only to get there to watch the vender NPC's parish in that very second, having to now make a rush forward hoping another isn't too far off. It suddenly makes every little action you do feel 'importent' in the grand scale of things, and it really forces you to learn to look out for selective map alterations, or carry around Map Scrolls to ensure you don't miss anything vital. The NPC's you can recrute as well also have  rather small, but kinda interesting storylines, each one giving a bit more clear overarching idea of just what's going on, and perhaps a way to really 'save the world'. Not to ruin anything, but those who explore and read up will chances are find far more then this game first lets on.\n\nOn top of all of this, is a small, but nifty option of online interactions. It's nothing Dark Souls worthy of jolly co-op and the like, but it's more say little snapshots into other's current playing situations as they trek on the same world, able to share a small snipit of text, and be shown how they are status wise. Of course, on death, you can also share something much the same, and depending on where you died, your ghost might help someone else's journey along, dropping a random peice of loot you had at the moment. Beyond all of that, it's a nice, addicting, and simple game you can pick up for an hour or two, feel like you've made some progress, and seems to always have just ONE more little thing to show you even many hours after the fact.","July 7, 2014","true","40.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And quite frankly it feels like I'm robbing the developers. I've been pretty hooked the last few days on it and expect to push through until I get full completion.\n\nIt is a rogue-like game, meaning that it has perma death and randomly generated worlds. You make a character, you pick from some classes and perks, and you push that character as far as it can go. A darkness on the left side of the screen keeps you moving ever forward in your attempt to get as much gear and power before your inevitable death or the death of the endboss. When you die, you gain some points that you can use to unlock more bonuses to choose from and slowly amass a constant storage between characters so you can save some epic items.\n\nThere is no real multiplayer other than a Dark Souls-like feature where you encounter the ghosts of players on the same server that benefit you slightly and that you can compete with.\n\nThe sound is cute and retro, nothing astounding. The visuals are about Final Fantasy 1 quality but are pretty enough to get you through. The gameplay really hooks me. For some people, you will spend many hours through many characters striving to do better and unlock everything. For others, you'll play for an hour or two.

With the very retro RPG look, and the handling of an old school adventure RPG, it's already got a lot going for it.\n\nThe game play is basically a "Run from the wall of death" style game reminicent of old side scrollers, where if the Death Wall (the Darkness in this case) gets you, you die, while at the same time, all of your resources are limited and nothing is infinite.  This makes the game heavy on the two major elements of game play:  Risk/Reward and Resourse Management.  Do I want to venture into that dungeon?  Will I get more out of it then I use to go in?  Will I die?\n\nThe other big element of gameplay is multiple play throughs.  You do a dimention, and either win or die.  All characters are "one and done."  On each subsequent play through, you make new characters, allowing you knowledge of what your characters are good and bad at, and giving you control over HOW you'll play each adventure.  After each adventure, you get points that you can use to unlock stronger abilities (perks), new classes, and expand the "Dimentional Box" which allows you to carry a limited number of items over to new adventures, or to merely store them for future difficult adventures.\n\nThe final big element of the game is the randomly genereated dimentions.  Each play through you can go to a new random dimention (with differing base parameters), replay old dimentions (same base parameters but different world layout), or do any of the current special dimentions with descriptions of what's special about them.  Alternately, you can input dimention codes manually to have a similar experience as friends, to find dimentions that spawn things you might want (finding codes online), or just to do your own variety of random.\n\nPros:\n- That price!\n- Lots of replay value\n- Enough customization options\n- Very rewarding gameplay\n\nCons:\n- Some dimentions can be surprisingly difficult even on the easiest mode\n- Can be grind intensive\n\nTips:\n- I have a coveted "Lumberjack Battleaxe" which is just the best at breaking walls.\n- Nice easy dimention:  RVOFGTKI","July 4, 2014","true","30.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You see, I was thinking "hurr durr all those games have steam cards yay free games for me," without actually considering if they would be fun. Frankly, I didn't expect any of them to be fun for longer than maybe half an hour.\n\nAnd boy was I wrong.\n\n>>SOUNDS AND MENUS AND PRACTICAL THINGS AND STUFF<<\nWhen I started it up, I was greeted by the typical low-resolution menu screen that reminded me of some fond childhood memories with my mother. I would be playing on the couch with my gameboy, sound on, and after a while my mother would express her annoyence of this sound by imitating them with considerable volume. The sounds that engulfed me from my speakers when I started the game and saw the menu were the kind of sounds my mother would so fondly imitate to me with her loud loving voice.\n\nAlready almost teary-eyed I pushed the button on my controller - which works flawlessly with this game - to begin a new adventure.\n\nAgain, I saw a screen pop up in front of me which reminded me of home, of my mother. You see, I had to pick a name. And it so happens that my mother gave me my name. Hence, the memories. I felt the tears forming in my eyes again.\n\nAside from picking a name, I also had to choose a class and several perks. My choice for a class was somewhat limited at first, as I could only choose between two classes. This, however, did not discourage me. For it seemed to me that there would be many opportunities for unlockable characters. And who doesn't love unlockable characters? Gleeful at the prospect of being able to unlock things I picked a class at random, after which I proceeded to put all of my perk slots into extra strength. I would need it.\n\nMy heart leapt with excitement as I pushed the button that would initiate my adventure.\n\nAnother screen popped up: the final portal that would bring me to the different universe that I had been waiting for. All I had yet to do was choose which universe this would be. A multitude of opportunites (i.e. more or less 7) appeared before my eyes. And once more, childhood memories filled my mind. Of my mother, who would with a kind smile let me pick out my own clothes, and then get mad at me for not being able to pick anything good. Tears streaming from my eyes I went for the option that my mother would have chosen. The randomly generated world.\n\nAnother two pushes on the button (one for picking the world, a second one for picking the difficulty), and I finally arrived.\n\n>>STORY<<\nI was a hero, and I was greeted by noble king Victor. I was told of a terrible fate to befall these lands. Of darkness, doom, and despair. Of the impending danger that was right behind me. Quite literally. And I would be the one to stop its merciless assault on these former peaceful lands.\n\nAnd so I embarked on my quest. The darkness ever licking at my heels. Again, quite literally.\n\nI noticed that I also had gained help, in the form of an artificial fairy called Iris. She seemed to be there for all the questions I had, which were none as the blood of heroes had been passed down to me from my mother and hence I did not need any help. I blinked away a tear.\n\n>>GAMEPLAY<<\nI rushed through the lands, never resting. Every step I took seemed to take at least 5 minutes. And every step I took seemed to make the many monsters that roamed the lands take one step closer to me as well.\n\nBut I couldn't dally and dance with these fiends for long. With every action of mine the darkness crept closer. I knew that it would be my end should it reach me. So I continued, slashing through waves and waves of demons and monsters as fast as I could.\n\nOn the way, I met many different innocent people. They would offer me their help in exchange for the money I came across on my journey. It was a sad business they practiced. As much as I would have wanted to, there was no way I could save them from the darkness that was creeping towards us. Merely moments after I had finished bartering with them, I would hear their dying screams coming from behind me. From inside the darkness, where they met an untimely demise. With my money.\n\n>>REPLAY VALUE<<\nTen minutes in my adventure I died. Like my mother.\n\nNah just kidding, she's still alive and kickin'.\nI did die though.\n\nBut my death did not discourage me. I had learned from my failures and had become stronger through them. And I knew that I would keep standing up each time I fell down. And I would keep growing stronger, and stronger, and stronger.\n\nAnd at last, I would make it. I would defeat the big evil boss, and peace would return the world!\n\nBut, would it be enough?\n\nThere were many other similar worlds. Like EWGHF, or QWUIHNAJ, or HHSJHEUI, or any other world that seemed to have gotten their names from some deity ramming his head on his keyboard several times.\n\nEach and every single one of them needed the help of someone.\n\nAnd that someone would be me. A hero.\n\nA hero, like my mother.\n\n\n\n;_;7","August 14, 2014","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Sure, there are the usual suspects, such as stats, leveling, items, monsters and even a final boss. But that is where the similarities end. Each game is a race against the clock where the encroaching darkness at the left of the screen advances while your heroic character must scramble right in search of experience, items, gold and helpful npc's.\n\nSound fun so far? It gets better, not only is the difficulty brutally hard and the classes vary in play style, but each world you play in is randomly determined at the start of a game. You can keep the names of these worlds and re-enter them to go back to the same world as before, yet even then the experiences are fresh enough to ensure replayability of the highest caliber.\nLike in Rogue Legacy, death is not the end of your efforts. Choosing a new class, and storing items in the dimensional vault makes the next game a little less harrowing if you choose. You can use the Hero points, awarded at the end of the game to unlock more classes and perks.\n\nThat being said, I was not kidding when I mentioned the brutal difficulty. In addition to powerful enemies, you might not have the best equipment because merchants do not appear often and you might not have cash at hand then. Or they appear often, but sell basic articles. And if you find a legendary sword? Use it sparingly as all equipment has a lifebar of such, if it runs out they break. Unless you have awesome perks and have gained levels at a crazy rate you can't beat the Demon Lord naked and unarmed.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is truly one that gives great bang for so few bucks. So get it!","March 15, 2014","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although this also means that there is room to tell your own tale in the adventures that will be had.\nThe difficulty is hard from the get go, and you'll take risks along the way to level up- Being too careful will hinder your level from rising, but barging in to a fight expecting to win will usually not end well!\nSo you will have to take use of the turn-based system to plan a strategy. But! Is there enough time for a rigid strategy as the world is swallowed up behind you? (each turn) -That is for you to adapt to as you discover this ever changing landscape.\n\n-Good-\nAbout the turn-based system, keep in mind it goes as fast as you want it to. You can run just as in any overview-2d game. But when you stop, everything else stops. This makes it both exhilarating but calming at the same time to me!\nWant to compete with other players? You can play the very same world (not simultaneously) and check leaderboards for whom performed the best in a variety of aspects such as leveling and treasure hunting etc-.\nAnd lest forget the character art, they have a charming manga-illustration kind of look which takes me back Final Fantasy IV.\n\n-Cons-\n\nNot a variety of tile texture- Since you'll find yourself writing a story to complement the lack of complete story, a larger variety of landscapes to inspire our minds would be nice. Also weather and lightning effects would be welcome.\n\nNo simultaneous multiplayer (just leaderboards). If the creators got an idea for how to implement multiplayer but still hold this fast-paced turn-based system, i could potentially see how that'd make for a sequel with great promise! But that's just me. (^^)\n\nOkay! Get to the adventure! :3\n楽しんでくださいね！","January 2, 2015","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is just great. Just great.\n\nNow, to the rest of the people, who want to know if they should buy the game. YES. DEFINITELY YES!\nThe price is ridiculously low. I got this game by selling trading cards.\nThe graphics are "fine". I don't know the engine this game was made on, but if I had to guess, I would say RPG Maker VX Ace (I use that engine for my works, and the graphics are pretty close) with a loooooot of custom scripting. Another reason this game is so good. A lot of work has been put on it, and I can see it.\nSo yeah, the graphics. They match the gameplay perfectly and they don't "try too hard" to impress. They are pretty, they are simple and they are great.\nThe music is pretty good too. Again, the music matches the gameplay and the whole atmosphere.\nThe story. Well, WHICH one? I mean, every player, has their own experience. YOU choose your path. YOU choose what to do with the guy or girl you are controlling. YOU can go around and kill everyone. Or YOU can be the hero and kill the Demon Lord. And on top of all, it's Rogue-like. That means, that everytime you play, even if you try to do exactly the same things, you will have a different experience.\nThis game has humor. When you "socialize" with your "companion", a smile on your face is guaranteed.\nThe only thing that I kinda hoped I could change, is the speed the darkness advances. The speed is perfect, don't get me wrong, but I would love to mess around a bit.\nAll in all, great game, I bought it for 0,74 euros and I would buy it even if it was 7 euros.","June 28, 2014","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Apart from that, it also has other unique elements like the dimensional vault or some of the abilities.\n\nI'm pretty sure I have never seen an ability before which makes my stats OP in exchange for my clothing.

Although this also means that there is room to tell your own tale in the adventures that will be had.\nThe difficulty is hard from the get go, and you'll take risks along the way to level up- Being too careful will hinder your level from rising, but barging in to a fight expecting to win will usually not end well!\nSo you will have to take use of the turn-based system to plan a strategy. But! Is there enough time for a rigid strategy as the world is swallowed up behind you? (each turn) -That is for you to adapt to as you discover this ever changing landscape.\n\n-Good-\nAbout the turn-based system, keep in mind it goes as fast as you want it to. You can run just as in any overview-2d game. But when you stop, everything else stops. This makes it both exhilarating but calming at the same time to me!\nWant to compete with other players? You can play the very same world (not simultaneously) and check leaderboards for whom performed the best in a variety of aspects such as leveling and treasure hunting etc-.\nAnd lest forget the character art, they have a charming manga-illustration kind of look which takes me back Final Fantasy IV.\n\n-Cons-\n\nNot a variety of tile texture- Since you'll find yourself writing a story to complement the lack of complete story, a larger variety of landscapes to inspire our minds would be nice. Also weather and lightning effects would be welcome.\n\nNo simultaneous multiplayer (just leaderboards). If the creators got an idea for how to implement multiplayer but still hold this fast-paced turn-based system, i could potentially see how that'd make for a sequel with great promise!

Cents.\n\nI was reluctant at first. "What could this game be? Looks like Final Fantasy Tactics, which I love, but is quite dated." I was delightfully WRONG. It plays more like Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, with the twist of death always pushing you from the left, forcing you to always move forward to the right. An amazing game with infinite replayability. After beating the short campaign with one class with one set of perks, you challenge yourself to play it again with a different class a different way, or even challenge a harder campaign. Honestly, I've seen games go for quite literally 4x the price and offer nothing but crap, with less gameplay and much less effort placed into it. This might be the only time I'll ever say the price tag is too low for such a game.","January 7, 2015","true","17.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What caught my attention to the game was the mult-world system, where there are infinite world seeds to add infinite possibility to the game, which also meant a lot of replay value. Secondly, the graphics and classes reminded me of my old favorites, the Final Fantasy games. After buying the game and DLC on a good whim, and trying it out for the first time, I immediately loved it. The encroaching darness actually made it a lot of fun because it added a sense of hurry and a feeling of loss when you couldn't reach that item or town in time, but it also wasn't too fast as to ruin the focus of the gameplay so I don't mind the rush because it still gives ample opportunity to do what you want while constaly reminding you to keep moving. Lastly, the dimentional storage system made it so that playing it again and again wasn't such a drag for unlocking new things because you can store and take items from the storage throughout multiple playthroughs making it a bit easier than doing it from scratch (although its a fun challenge playing hard difficulties without using the stoage).\n\nSo as for final thoughts on the game; I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes old school RPG's with a twist. Also if you're looking for a game with great replay value, I'd say this game is up there with 'Binding of Isaac: Rebrith/Afterbirth' for a fraction of the price. It has plenty to unlock, along with a fair amount of items to use to your advantage. 9.5/10 Definately would support this game if more DLC's came out for it.","December 10, 2015","true","23.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One of my favorite aspects of a randomly generated world is the fact that you're not going to see everything the first play through... Or the second play through... Or even the twenty-second! I still have not figured out how to recruit other party members during the journey, but I'm fine with that because I've been so preoccupied with discovering all the other things you can do with different classes.\n\nSpeaking of classes, I normally hate class systems in an RPG. When you have to devote to one for the entire game and you're not even sure if it's your favorite because you haven't got to try the others yet. But in One Way Heroics, many runs are fairly short, so you can try every class that you like. Get a feel for all of them. Then play the one you feel like playing based on your mood. It's kind of like a fighter game in that aspect; you pick a character based on the kind of match you expect to have.\n\nAnother great thing about the classes in One Way Heroics is the fact that they all have something unique and interesting to bring to the table. Each has a special skills, and each has regular skills that they perform better or with a bonus. It's balanced pretty well and it makes picking a favorite for your style of play easy.\n\nThe variety of items is the last good point I'd like to touch on. One thing I almost always start out with is increased inventory ability, because I love picking up as many items as I can and using them effectively. One Way Heroics exhibits great balance between character stats and the necessity for equipment. You can make your character strong, sure, but if you don't find a rare and powerful weapon or some really good armor, you're going to be running from the demon lord many times before you can hope to fight him.\n\nThe one down side to this game I'll mention is the character design. The artwork is a little sloppy looking, though charming in it's own way, and the character dialog, while funny at first, is a little lacking in terms of variety. Well. during gameplay anyway--Dialog is actually pretty good during cut scenes, as I am hit with something new almost every new game and end game. Finally characters feel a little flat. Even though the after story of you and the fairy continuing your journey after the world is saved is rather touching, it feels awkward because I don't really feel connected to the characters. They're too generic, but then, maybe that was intended.\n\nAll in all, great game. 9/10\n\n(This is my first review, so I haven't developed any kind of coherent style.)","November 12, 2015","true","15.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now for the breakdown\n\nMusic\nThe music is never really downbeat, though there are times when it's calmed down.\nIt tends to pick up to a rousing adventure theme when combat really begins to happen\nThe music in towns is really calming, to the point that I've just sat in towns listening to the music playing\n\nI tend to reccomend listening to the music of any game prior to purchase though, and there's an awesome playlist on youtube containing all of the music from the game.\n\nInterface\nThe interface in the base game is kind of unintuitive, with the keys being used as follows: R T W A S D Ctrl Shift\n\nThere might have been more, but either never needed them, or they just didn't come up.\n\nThe intro menu here is really simple, but the opportunity to rerun a map you like just because you remember its seed is awesome, but there's not much that's all that interesting in the intro menu.\n\nThe in-game menus are interesting, but I do have just one issue in that you can "use" a bomb, by which I mean it will just explode on you. I don't know why this is an option but I accidently use the bomb instead of throwing it more often than I'd like to admit. But beyond the occasional issue with that, the menus are easy to understand, just getting into it the first time is a bit interesting.\n\n\nThe interface in the expansion is much more compact with the numbers on the keyboard being used for quick acess inventory slots. The rest of the keys are: Z X C V Shift Ctrl W A S D or the arrows\n\nThe expansion makes the menus even easier to use, as well as picking up dropped items.\n\n\nGameplay\nIt's a Turn based roguelike with the opportunity to overcome every map that I've come across, though it may take several attempts to do so.\n\nThe combat is really intuitive, where the combination of shift and direction makes aiming easy, and there's only one attack button, which allows you to really take advantage of the turn-based global interaction.\n\nIt is possible to get all pooped on by the spawning of the enemies, or even by travelling to the wrong bit of the map and getting stuck behind a wall of mountains, but so far, I've had only a couple of instances where this happened.\n\nMy complaints here are really just twofold, with the first one being the bomb issue. There's a number of games I lost because of that, but it's my fault. The other is how slow the game can be on the longer runs, but the expansion allows the speeding up of movement so I no longer have this issue.\n\nStory\nNope. not telling you. If you want to find out, do so yourself.\nIt is a compelling story found out through gameplay if done correctly though.\n\n\nReally, as a quick sum up of all that: the game is really well put together and the expansion just tightens some controls and adds to the game as a whole. I spent $7 on this and as you can see I've put in 40-ish hours into it. I love it, and it's something that, if you like the gameplay, you'll love the game. If you don't like the aesthetics and or the gameplay, you won't really feel bad about it because you've probably spent more money on worse games.\n\nEnjoy!

I'll also mention that it is currently about $.80. I would have happily paid at least ten times that price.","December 30, 2014","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was actully surpirised on how much I liked it and how many hours I sank into it. It is nice in the fact it doesn't do any hand holding (none besides keep moving right). So there was lots of trial and errors (dying) with charaters class (which you can unlock more as you progress) until you find your rythm. Each user will have a class they are just better at and a class that they rather not use (its all dependant on your playing style) and there are particular monsters that are bigger pains in the butts. It really is your game: want to kill citizen for gold you can, want to collect tons of treasure, sure, or just run away from everything (including the dark lord). You unlock more story as you continue playing and playing with different charaters classes. Its not the most complicated game out there but it can keep you playing for quite some time.","August 4, 2015","true","25.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's just that this game has a lot more in common with the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series than, say, Nethack. PMD owns, though, and so does this game.\n\nLots of cool ideas and mechanics here, and nothing too complicated or obtuse.  Localization has a lot of that awkward-english charm that people love in things like Cave Story. Servicable graphics/sound. Tons of replayability, very addictive. My one complaint is that the final class you unlock is so much better than every other one there's no reason to play the old ones once you get her.\n\nStill, great game, and at this price it's a steal.","December 25, 2014","true","15.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Said twist works out surprisingly well. It's not very expensive and it's pretty enjoyable. The one real downside is the balance seems to be a bit wonky, with holy weapons being perhaps too crucial to victory. The Dimensional Vault is a nice concept, which definitely helps some of the problems stemming from the randomness. The soundtrack is also a nice touch. All in all, it's worth the low cost, but bear in mind that it can be a bit repetitive after awhile.\n\nHave not tried the new expansion yet.","August 20, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes.\nIs it fun? Yes.\nShould you buy it? Yes, especially when on sale.\nIs the OWH+ DLC worth it? Yes, every steam penny you spend on it.\n\nNow for the unnecessarily long analysis portion:\n\nOne Way Heroics is a Roguelike with large amounts of Turn-Based RPG elements. Your character grows stronger as they defeat enemies, you can equip a variety of different weapons, there are multiple character classes, and there are even quests in the game which require recruiting certain characters or speaking with a specific person (OWH+ has quests to unlock extra character classes and a quest to return a little girl to her father).\n\nSome other mechanics the game runs on include:\n\n- Everything moves on a grid\n- You have a stamina bar that allows you to climb mountains, swim in water, and use special attacks\n- You also have an energy meter which is refilled by eating food, it also provides energy for force attacks\n- Every recruitable character has affinity that goes up as you travel with them or do specific things on the way such as eat a specific kind of food or kill enemies\n- The recruitable characters can also be levelled up\n- Weapons can be given extra attributes via scrolls or other such objects\n- Most items have weight (arrows and gemstones don't) and if you exceed the weight limit, you can't move\n- You can unlock various perks that help you along the way\n- You can find goddess statues throughout the world which give you special boosts for the cost of levels\n- The Awakening ability, which allows you to take five consecutive actions without anything else moving\n- The Dimensional Vault which lets you store items from a run and take them out again for a different run\n- Your weapons and armor will break after a certain number of hits, given or recieved\n\nMechanics specific to OWH+\n\n- Food can go bad as time goes on\n- You level up upon reaching a new area\n- You can add extra parts to the starting castle with Dimensional Gold Coins you find in each run, you can also place special NPCs in these extra parts\n- Extra perks that make the game harder but greatly improve your rank and score\n- Tons of extra items that aren't in the regular version\n\nThe biggest and most important game mechanic however, is the darkness. The darkness is always on the left side of the screen, and if you get swallowed by it, you die. Every time you do something, be it moving, attacking, equipping an item, or even talking to someone, the darkness moves forward. This means that ever action has to count, and you have to really think of possible risk vs. reward of doing specific things. Because if you go into a dungeon and can't get back out in time, you will be consumed and that'll be it. You can use the Awakening ability to get away, but it only has five uses per run, and the world goes on for a long way (10,000 km if I recall correctly).\n\nOverall, a really good experience, and one I highly recommend.","September 1, 2015","true","69.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game itself isn't inherently hard, but you have so little to work with that it takes getting used to. Warning to new players to stay away from Golems, they have set spawn locations per world and they are nasty with or without an axe (which does more damage to them).\n\nCharacters can be unlocked with points rewarded for your progress after each death or by completeing a certain feat. You can use these points to get a vault and add space to said vault. The Vault NPC is in the set spawn for each character. I recommend always keeping a Key of Seals in the Vault if you manage to come across one. Keys of Seals are used on Temples and can give you Holy Artifacts. My first holy artifact was an Axe that crushed everything before me. By the time it had worn down i found another temple and another key of seals, and got a Holy Spear and Holy Chest Armor. Made it the last 80 km to the Demon Loard and killed him with no struggle.\n\nI've only gotten 2.8 hrs of playtime in the time of this review, but i could easily put 200 hours into it.

What caught my attention to the game was the mult-world system, where there are infinite world seeds to add infinite possibility to the game, which also meant a lot of replay value. Secondly, the graphics and classes reminded me of my old favorites, the Final Fantasy games. After buying the game and DLC on a good whim, and trying it out for the first time, I immediately loved it. The encroaching darness actually made it a lot of fun because it added a sense of hurry and a feeling of loss when you couldn't reach that item or town in time, but it also wasn't too fast as to ruin the focus of the gameplay so I don't mind the rush because it still gives ample opportunity to do what you want while constaly reminding you to keep moving. Lastly, the dimentional storage system made it so that playing it again and again wasn't such a drag for unlocking new things because you can store and take items from the storage throughout multiple playthroughs making it a bit easier than doing it from scratch (although its a fun challenge playing hard difficulties without using the stoage).\n\nSo as for final thoughts on the game; I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes old school RPG's with a twist. Also if you're looking for a game with great replay value, I'd say this game is up there with 'Binding of Isaac: Rebrith/Afterbirth' for a fraction of the price. It has plenty to unlock, along with a fair amount of items to use to your advantage. 9.5/10 Definately would support this game if more DLC's came out for it.","December 10, 2015","true","23.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Besides being a unique procedurally-generated RPG with an appealing soundtrack, this game has another worthwhile distinction that isn't frequently mentioned in positive reviews: One Way Heroics is conducive to playing in short bursts, or for hours at a time. On a low difficulty, you can clear the game in half an hour, provided you have some idea of what you're doing. Higher difficulties -- assuming you don't blunder about and lose right away -- can offer hours-long campaigns. I appreciate that kind of versatility in a game, and One Way Heroics does it better than most.","December 26, 2015","true","59.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You are forced to travel to the right in your quest as the darkness destroys everything from the left. Each world you save unlocks more classes, perks and other bonuses that bring you closer to solving the mystery behind the threat that engulfs endless worlds.\n\nThe gameplay is quite well balanced, allowing for different playstyles. The variety of difficulties, campaign types and options encourage players of all skill levels to continue moving forward. While the art could use some improvement, the music is decent and the story is quite interesting and well-written.\n\n"One Way Heroics" brings the excitement of permanent death while giving players many reasons to keep trying again. I highly recommend the game to both roguelike veterans and those new to the genre.

It has been quite a few months that I rarely got into a game and played it more than 2 hours, except some like Borderlands 2, Minecraft, and some little other games.. And well, this game is a rare jewel in gaming industry, which I know I'll play a lot before stopping.\n\nFirst, I got it as a present, so I didn't have to spend anything on it, but damn that was an awesome gift. As for the game itself, I first thought it would be a really repetitive thing where you always do the same thing with no fun... And it's an awesome game with lots of fun.\n\nThe first thing that hit me is that I will always want to play more. I'm not a fan of games where you have a limited amount of time to do something, but the darkness push you to go further in the game, and gives an incredible adrenaline boost.\n\nSecond thing is that I'm a great fan of Roleplay and such, and this game is just like urging my Roleplaying soul to put myself into my character. It just gives so many possibilities, you cannot avoid this game if you like Roleplaying as much as I do.\n\nSo, I guess I'll make kind of a summary:\n\nPros:\n+ Very fun game, never gets boring\n+ Graphics pretty decent\n+ "Just one more turn"-kind of game\n+ One playthrough is not that long until you find a save point/die, so you can play this when you're bored and have little time\n+ My Roleplaying feti... I mean soul is pleased\n+ It's quite funny sometimes as well\n+ Your personal fairy that will ask you to bath because you stink\n+ Great durability\n\nCons:\n- Little character creation, only two appareances for each class and perks... Although the classes are all fun.\n- The randomly created worlds can go from "you're fukken' lucky" to "lol ur doomd m8". I never screamed as much when I had to pass through a snow biome, then desert, then volcanic, and then snow again.\n- Really frustating when you lose your game because you lacked one turn after achieving more than you ever did.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWould I advice you to buy this game? Depends. If you don't want to play a game where you do quite the same thing over and over again, but in different situations, or if you want an easy-to-clear game, don't buy it. Otherwise, if you love RPGs and if you wanna get a game where Roleplay is highly encouraged, and if you have some patience, buy this game.","April 3, 2015","true","9.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

For me, One Way Heroics is that, except I'd feel happy paying more than sale price.\n\nOne Way Heroics is a rouge-like game kinda like a Mystery Dungeon game, except you're not stuck in a dungeon and have a randomly generated world to explore. Except with one twist: There's Darkness to the left. And it endlessly creeps up on you. And if you fall in it, you're dead! So you're stuck going to the right. And there's monsters out there, too, so remain on guard! Of course, there's helpful stuff out there, too!\n\nOne Way Heroics is kinda tough at first, but it gets easier as you go along, unlock classes, and generally get an idea of what to do. And it's alright if you mess up after you got some cool item, because after you die or clear you game, you're allowed to put items into the Dimensional Vault, to use them on another run. You've got limited space, though, so until you're heroic enough to expand it, watch how you use it!\n\nI had a lot of fun with this game, and I only spent 87 cents on it! So it's a definite recommendation from me.","January 31, 2015","true","24.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is probably one of the only roguelike games with a progression system that fits perfectly with the game as a whole, with many runs only lasting about an hour, and the most you can get are unlockables to change your starting character or to save equipment. Whatever writing is there is usually light-hearted and sometimes witty, even in such a depressing world where everyone behind you DIES. I also love the world generation system where you can replay the same seed over and over again and almost play it like a normal RPG.\n\nThe Plus version is pretty much necessary to fully enjoy this game, but I think the low price and hours of fun you'll get is worth it.

To tell you the truth, for such a price, I was expecting something horrible, dreadful, like an 8-bit Ride to Hell. Did I got surprised? Yeah! Buuuuuuut as usual, let me explain the BAD things the game has first, so we can take them out of the way:\n\nThe game is kind of short. Of course, for such a price, you can understand it, so it's not that big of a deal. Besides, this is a Rogue-like game, and rogue-like games are usually short, but change in every playthrough, this is no different from the standard on that regard.\n\nThe other thing that I did not like at all, is the lack of multiplayer. This game had such extreme potential for a Coop experience, but instead you can play the same randomly generated world at the same time as one of your friends, to see who goes further...INSTEAD OF PLAYING TOGETHER, AND HAVING FUN! I was indeed dissapointed by that, by looking at the captures of some friends that got the game, and by looking at the pictures and videos of the Steam-Store, I was expecting to play at least with one friend in a journey to save the world by punching demons on their d#cks.  You know, the usual.\n\nNow, let's talk about the GOOD stuff, pretty much everything else. As I said, it's a Rogue-Like. At the start of the playthrough you select the kind of character you desire to control, and special skills for you: You want to be fast? You want to be strong? You want to use magic? You want to start with a companion? You want to start with insane amoutns of gold? It's your choice, and it's indeed well made. I really did enjoy starting in different ways, and testing different strategies.\n\nThe game pretty much goes like this: The world is being taken out by some sort of "Dark Sonic Boom" (Damn Obama, he stole that from Guille!), and ANYTHING NEAR THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN IS F#CKED. Your goal is to travel to the right, getting stronger, surviving the wilds, getting better gear, meeting other people, saving lives, and if you get far enough, saving the world. It might sound simple enough, but the game mechanics make this journey, a journey to remember: First of all, you have to eat, or your character will get tired. Sounds easy enough? Well, there's not that many free food out there, so you have to make sure to visit any Inn or Town and get supplies before they got suck up into Oblivion (I bet that portal leads to Obama's #sshole, NOW THAT'S ONE SICK WAY TO END UP DEAD). Not only that, but your equipment won't last forever. Your stuff has limited use, for example, 100 uses on a sword. Once you swing it for the 100th time, the thing breaks, and it's lost forever. There are ways to repair it and make it last longer, but you should make sure to AT LEAST CARRY 1 BACKUP WEAPON. Infact, I always try to carry at least 3 weapons on myself. And armor? HAH, THOSE THINGS BREAK TOO, SHIELDS INCLUDED! You're far pass f#cked on these lands, specially later on when enemies start to get dangerous!\n\nFor a cheap game, there's a lot of fun to be had in this game, and I do recommend it. The game is worth 3€ WITHOUT sales, and that's already cheap enough, on sales it usually lowers to 1€ or so. It's up to you to buy it or not, but I do recommend that you give it a try.","October 28, 2014","true","6.6"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Darkaros/recommended/266210/","Darkaros","Darkaros","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Darkaros/","333 products in account","This game is brutal no matter what difficulty you pick, in best possible way as a rogue-like. It has a VERY surprising amount of depth for a game that is by default played on a resolution of about a smart phone (what you see in the screenshots is what you get, and full-screening it does not help its prettiness!). Graphics-wise, it's incredibly indie -- see the character "portraits" in the bottom left corner that seem to be sketches made a bored developer, especially Swordmaster Class C for a laugh.\n\nIf you get this game, it's for its gameplay, which does one thing, but does it really, really well. The turn-based gameplay with a constant timer and emphasis on movement will make it incredibly addicting for old-time Rogue-like players, as experience points (read: monsters to farm) and treasure may be within arm's reach but inaccessible due to the choices you have to make. The item appraisal system makes every item a mystery and makes even a new starting sword drop a desired reward, as durability constantly counts down with few ways to repair items and replenish supplies. Even when you're on top of the world, you'll feel pressured and challenged by item weights and inventory limits, decreasing energy and stamina, and other factors to encourage you to weigh risk and reward ("how long should I wear this Training Bracelet, which cripples my stats for more experience?") to get ready for the next area.\n\nThe "hidden" parts of the game are by far the most enticing. You simply have to go out and find out for yourself how to get access to things like Party Members, Force powers (spells), the Dark Brotherhood, Hidden Elf Villages, Goddess Statues, and Key of Seals and their associated doors. After each death or victory, the progression system encourages trial and error, mixing and matching unlockable classes and perks with rotating featured Dimensions and allowing players to access the Dimensional Vault to carry over a limited number of items. The game is well-supported outside of a playthrough with a replay system, a hall of fame for each dimension and for your overall profile, and, of course, the different daily Dimensions featured. It does not hold your hand after kicking you out of the castle with a fairy of questionable use, explaining only the most basic and necessary mechanics until you recruit party members: you have to go out and discover it for yourself, since at a base level the game is so simple! Even the limited story and simple humor is fun to discover, especially as more party-member-specific endings are unlocked.\n\nOne of the best games on Steam under $5, and amongst my favorite Rogue-likes; highly, highly recommend.","October 3, 2014","true","31.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Fairly typical hero stuff, really.\n\nAlthough deviations to the term aply, this game is a rogue-like in most of its aspects. There is a grid system and it's "turn based", as one would expect: strategy plays a role here, if not too deeply, since you should be killing or avoiding any enemy that comes across you. The mechanics are pretty simple too: you can move in eight directions, you can attack, skip a turn, interact with a friendly character near you (or in your party), use the various items you come across, equip equipable stuff and use skills related to your character's class, chosen at the beggining of a session.\n\nIf you aren't into rogue-likes, you may consider this one for how forgiving it is: at the end of a session (where a victory or defeat condition activates, I mean,) you will always get some "Hero Points" that you can save up to unlock more features, such as different classes, more starting perks to help you ensure victory and the all-important sink that is your Interdimensional Vault. Simply put, when you get a game over you can stash stuff you had with you and take it out with your next characters. Maybe that sword you picked up last run was actually good? Use it some other time and turn the tide when you most need it, maybe. Winning a session also nets you different items depending on the victory conditions which are significantly powerful, so a win may cause you a streak of wins later if you play your cards right.\n\nWhere One Way Heroics (OWH from now on) shines is that even though this is a rogue-like with little depth it is extremely replayable for quite a few reasons.\n\nFirst, for the achievement-seekers out there, you litterally can't (or shouldn't) be able to get everything in a single day, but only a couple of the hardest challenges will make you gnash your teeth; you will surely think them worth it when you complete them.\n\nSecond, even though you can input a seed (ie: the base for how something else spans) for every session you start, OWH kindly gives you a few ones specific to each and every day with incentives to play them. There's a "guaranteed ally" seed, a "special rule" seed and a "hey, this is just another seed, but since everyone knows it there's a bigger chance of finding someone else's ghost to help you" seed. In other words, seeds that will help you be victorious or give you the challenge you need to feel like the game is actually worth playing it for the sake of claiming to be its master.\n\nThird, but possibly not the best reason, is that in a world filled with many things claiming "rogue-like" or some such thing without actually being and where every indie game is more likely to be something you didn't really want before you've realized it, OWH is a genuine rogue-like that is, albeit simple and on the easy side, masterfully done. Unidentified equipment that can be identified, scrolls of enchanting, items of quirky features that let you escape something you surely couldn't face, the traditional "go down to level X" transformed into "hey, if you don't get a move on The Darkness will swallow you" and monsters with randarts such as Tough, Fire-breathing or Crazy... Yes. If a game has a right to call itself rogue-like, OWH certainly qualifies.\n\nThe pixel art of the game is pretty good too. Nothing is under or overdrawn or feels out of place. You also get to see some "higher definition" portraits every now and then of some relevant characters in the game, but that's not really the most common of events. The interface may be a little quirky before you get used to it, as it is clearly built to save time while using it intesively, but it's very solid once you're familiar with it. I noticed some people complain about the music: it's entirely optional to mute it, but I advise against it; some themes may be dull or annoying after a while, but others stand out for their inspiring feel. I'd even risk saying that without the music this game would lose all of its mysterious "continue playing me" effect. As for the general sound effects, it doesn't stand out much: it's not bad, it feels natural but it won't make or break the game if that's your tipping point.\n\nAlso to consider is that OWH allows saving of the particular run you're going through. With (infinite?) save slots, the only limitation is finding the Save Attendent NPC in a random upcoming village or how much bagspace you can afford to carry save crystals (which, even though also found in the wild, are sold by the afforementioned NPC). I'd advise against saving unless you really want to continue that particular run the next time you come around, as personally I encountered a feature I didn't anticipate in the game that prevents a serious exploit about item duping: an older run won after another run has finished can not save its items into the vault. Live and learn, live and learn...\n\nThe last thing I want to mention is the "online features" the game has. Basically, useless info keeps popping up in the interface about the other people that are playing (or have played) in your session's seed. Arguably nothing to write home about, if not for the subliminal knowledge that gets leaked from it now and then: others may have come upon strategies that you can replicate and have an easier time reaching your own goals by using. But of course, the same aplies in reverse: your session's information sometimes gets uploaded and everyone else will see your useful/useless little blurb about how you're doing or how you did. You can even set what message to be broadcast the next time it gets uploaded, in case you care (you should care; your default message is "I've reached NAME OF UNREADABLE RANDOM_STRING #typeOfLand", when you can be saying cool stuff like how many bad guys you've bagged or what you currently have equipped).\n\nBy now you should have your own opinion about whether you're interested in this game or not. If you're into true rogue-likes, this is an excellent one to add to your library. If you're not sure if you'd like rogue-likes but would like to know, this game is a good bridge to the vast world of (real and true) rogue-likes with its narrowed aproach. If money is usually the issue, say no more: OWH is just a cent short of being 3€; in a time/money spent ratio, your use time is approaching infinity for the low initial investment you'll pay. If nothing of the previous paragraph urged you to buy this game, let me try the superliminal way. Buy One Way Heroics: you know you want to, and you know you can afford it. If that didn't work, I'll even chuck my seal of aproval straight in your eyes. And if that didn't work either, I guess you're one of those people who'll miss out on a true gem because you're more into "CODs" or "Assassin's ExcuseOfAGame" than classic gaming.","March 16, 2014","true","46.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

One Way Heroics may not seem much as it is an RPG game, but once you get into it, you will fall in love with it. The first thing you may notice of the game is the music. The music practically sets it apart from other RPG or any other games in general. The music is the emotion of the game. The story is pretty interesting too, and the whole time you have to run away from the looming darkness. That is where the name comes from, since you can only go in one way or direction. The last thing I have to say about this amazing game is: The difficulty. This game is not easy at all, you will die many times. Sure, you may rage quit, but this game will draw you back.

Fairly typical hero stuff, really.\n\nAlthough deviations to the term aply, this game is a rogue-like in most of its aspects. There is a grid system and it's "turn based", as one would expect: strategy plays a role here, if not too deeply, since you should be killing or avoiding any enemy that comes across you. The mechanics are pretty simple too: you can move in eight directions, you can attack, skip a turn, interact with a friendly character near you (or in your party), use the various items you come across, equip equipable stuff and use skills related to your character's class, chosen at the beggining of a session.\n\nIf you aren't into rogue-likes, you may consider this one for how forgiving it is: at the end of a session (where a victory or defeat condition activates, I mean,) you will always get some "Hero Points" that you can save up to unlock more features, such as different classes, more starting perks to help you ensure victory and the all-important sink that is your Interdimensional Vault. Simply put, when you get a game over you can stash stuff you had with you and take it out with your next characters. Maybe that sword you picked up last run was actually good? Use it some other time and turn the tide when you most need it, maybe. Winning a session also nets you different items depending on the victory conditions which are significantly powerful, so a win may cause you a streak of wins later if you play your cards right.\n\nWhere One Way Heroics (OWH from now on) shines is that even though this is a rogue-like with little depth it is extremely replayable for quite a few reasons.\n\nFirst, for the achievement-seekers out there, you litterally can't (or shouldn't) be able to get everything in a single day, but only a couple of the hardest challenges will make you gnash your teeth; you will surely think them worth it when you complete them.\n\nSecond, even though you can input a seed (ie: the base for how something else spans) for every session you start, OWH kindly gives you a few ones specific to each and every day with incentives to play them. There's a "guaranteed ally" seed, a "special rule" seed and a "hey, this is just another seed, but since everyone knows it there's a bigger chance of finding someone else's ghost to help you" seed. In other words, seeds that will help you be victorious or give you the challenge you need to feel like the game is actually worth playing it for the sake of claiming to be its master.\n\nThird, but possibly not the best reason, is that in a world filled with many things claiming "rogue-like" or some such thing without actually being and where every indie game is more likely to be something you didn't really want before you've realized it, OWH is a genuine rogue-like that is, albeit simple and on the easy side, masterfully done. Unidentified equipment that can be identified, scrolls of enchanting, items of quirky features that let you escape something you surely couldn't face, the traditional "go down to level X" transformed into "hey, if you don't get a move on The Darkness will swallow you" and monsters with randarts such as Tough, Fire-breathing or Crazy... Yes. If a game has a right to call itself rogue-like, OWH certainly qualifies.\n\nThe pixel art of the game is pretty good too. Nothing is under or overdrawn or feels out of place. You also get to see some "higher definition" portraits every now and then of some relevant characters in the game, but that's not really the most common of events. The interface may be a little quirky before you get used to it, as it is clearly built to save time while using it intesively, but it's very solid once you're familiar with it.

As for the general sound effects, it doesn't stand out much: it's not bad, it feels natural but it won't make or break the game if that's your tipping point.\n\nAlso to consider is that OWH allows saving of the particular run you're going through. With (infinite?) save slots, the only limitation is finding the Save Attendent NPC in a random upcoming village or how much bagspace you can afford to carry save crystals (which, even though also found in the wild, are sold by the afforementioned NPC). I'd advise against saving unless you really want to continue that particular run the next time you come around, as personally I encountered a feature I didn't anticipate in the game that prevents a serious exploit about item duping: an older run won after another run has finished can not save its items into the vault. Live and learn, live and learn...\n\nThe last thing I want to mention is the "online features" the game has. Basically, useless info keeps popping up in the interface about the other people that are playing (or have played) in your session's seed. Arguably nothing to write home about, if not for the subliminal knowledge that gets leaked from it now and then: others may have come upon strategies that you can replicate and have an easier time reaching your own goals by using. But of course, the same aplies in reverse: your session's information sometimes gets uploaded and everyone else will see your useful/useless little blurb about how you're doing or how you did. You can even set what message to be broadcast the next time it gets uploaded, in case you care (you should care; your default message is "I've reached NAME OF UNREADABLE RANDOM_STRING #typeOfLand", when you can be saying cool stuff like how many bad guys you've bagged or what you currently have equipped).\n\nBy now you should have your own opinion about whether you're interested in this game or not.

One Way Heroics may not seem much as it is an RPG game, but once you get into it, you will fall in love with it. The first thing you may notice of the game is the music. The music practically sets it apart from other RPG or any other games in general. The music is the emotion of the game. The story is pretty interesting too, and the whole time you have to run away from the looming darkness. That is where the name comes from, since you can only go in one way or direction. The last thing I have to say about this amazing game is: The difficulty. This game is not easy at all, you will die many times. Sure, you may rage quit, but this game will draw you back. It is different everytime you play it.\n\nTo sum all things up, get the game.

I'm not a fan of roguelikes; losing all my progress with nothing to show for it isn't my bag. However this game managed to get me hooked on it despite loss after loss because of the minor progression system that unlocks new content after every playthrough.\n\nA deep, fun experience that just so happens to be $1 every major sale.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eternatea/recommended/266210/","eternatea","EternaTea","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eternatea/","376 products in account","TLDR:  Only buy this game if you get it WITH the expansion, and preferably on sale.  The reason I don't recommend it is because One Way Heroics is still an incomplete game, with the expansion and all.\n\nThe review:\n\nAfter 70 hours playtime, I can't recommend One Way Heroics.  Without the expansion (One Way Heroics Plus, $6.49), this game is borderline unplayable.  The expansion brings in much needed UI updates, gameplay tweaks, more items and more characters.  And a ton of bug fixes.\n\nProblem is, most of that stuff should have been patched in to the base game.  Or, more realistically, put in to the game before it ever released.  Especially since, even with all that, it still feels like a beta version.  Very late in the beta process, but still not quite ready for release.  Somewhere in the polishing phase.  Bugs are still being squashed to this day, and I experienced plenty in my time with the game.\n\nOnce you take all the things from OWH+, and subtract them out since they should have been included in the main game prior to release, you're left with just the new classes and the castle expansions.  And they aren't worth $6.49 by themselves.  The classes are easy to gloss over, and none of the castle expansions have a huge impact on your game.  You can easily do without both.\n\nWith a bit of a shallow story, one that was also poorly translated, the gameplay is what keeps you coming back.  And it's (almost) all there... so long as you make sure to pick up OWH+ as well.","March 6","false","70.6"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","15","31","2","0"

This game puts you think not only about stock, but the matter of stats in what you have. Tthe game provides a good random world generation and fun little remarks along the way with each playthrough. However at the end, they provide advice, help, tips, and tricks that will help you in your next playthrough. The points you obtain after each playthrough are put to the end game to help you decide if you want to unlock a class, perk, or add items to a dimensional vault. With that said, the game provides entertainment. I give it a 5 out of 5 in my opinion for keeping it good paced, makes me go back for more. If to put it accurately on scale, It would be nice if would be a 4.8 out of 5 because of some things such as the matter of certain monsters. Nonetheless even if it is a "walk in the park" mode, each playthrough in each world provides an experience unique. I found it quite entertaining and enthralling. However at points can get mad because of the fact of certain options, do yo wanna save now and lose 5 levels. I think not, however as you play more and more throughout you get more info around the world and develop more points that add up. Rack them all up and bonuses appear on skills and perks. Eventually you will obtain a nice amount and make your experience turn. I hate to admit it but dying in this game sort of helps you out.  Reminds me of other games and concepts. Nonetheless great game  I recommend for those interested in a fun highly replayable and growing game. It's something that is quite indulging. I took the time going through the npcs, areas, while running for my life against that horde. Yet I feel bad everytime I think about some of them. Nonetheless as some say, you realize what really matters or what you have to do when it is about to be gone in your life. Still this game adds quite the element on point of classes. They give you each specifics with bonuses and will help you understand how you want to play if you choose this. There are as many worlds you can make and use as long as you keep trying. Been playing at odds and ends with it in my first world since I got it. I got highly addicted.","February 28, 2014","true","71.4"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

It's a very simple, yet complex system as there are a multitude of effects to change the style that you play. (examples: combos, criticals, ranged, meditation, throwables, etc etc)\n\n\n\nAnother huge aspect, which I believe carries this game to a better aspect, is it's music.\nWhile the volume isn't always properly adjusted for some of the areas, the music is still great for every single area/theme in the game.\nalso I swear I heard guile's theme...\n\n\nIn addition to to having great music, the effort they put into the smaller details in the game, such as character interaction and ending sequences, goes to show how much they actually cared for the game. This is something more developers need to do.\n\n\nI would give this game a solid 9/10.\n-1 point for including hippy tree huggers.","February 27, 2015","true","284.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The system is kept rather simple, and games necessarily have a relatively short duration even if you win them by killing the demon lord at the end. (I managed to win on my 3rd try, which took about an hour.)\n\nMultiple playthroughs are worthwhile because there are various classes and perks to be unlocked. Additionally you have a "dimensional vault" that you can use to store up items from your previous attempt to use in your next one. So while your character isnt all that persistent, your profile is.\n\nI bought the game on sale for $1, and it was one of the best $1 purchases I've made here.","June 26, 2014","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KianaWolf/recommended/266210/","KianaWolf","Kiana","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KianaWolf/","141 products in account","A fun, but repetitive game, that will quickly grow old.\n\nThe game is essentially a roguelike 'lite', as there actually isn't much randomization when you get down to it. A handful of terrain types, a handful of dungeon layouts, a handful of enemy types. After a few playthroughs, you'll have seen everything in the game, so it's only a question of what order you'll encounter them.\n\nMany of the perks are of miniscule use at best, such as improving your swimming skill. The classes generally aren't too different from each other in practice, outside of their own gimmick. The Force User, for example, can learn spells at any time by exchanging levels. But most of the spells aren't worth the cost, so you'll find yourself using your basic attack spell while saving up experience. Since most skills have a significant cost restriction, you'll find yourself using basic attacks and relying on position for most of the game, rather than unique skills.\n\nThat being said, for $4, you're getting your money's worth. A few hours of fun, maybe more if you really want to stretch the challenge, and it is very fun for those few hours. It might be a game that you enjoy for an afternoon, then forget about for a few months, only to come back and enjoy it again. Maybe it'll be a game you only enjoy for a day, even if you never play it again. All in all, worth checking out if it appeals to you, but don't expect it to be exceptionally memorable.","July 12, 2014","true","9.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So make sure you are not inside of a building when that happends lol.\n\nYou have to kill enemies to get  experience and leveling up and finding loot to make your character stronger.\nYou get points at the end of the level which will help you on the next run. (once you have spend it ofcourse)\n\nSo basically you are running away from the left side, fighting, and till you have reached the marker point, you will have to fight the boss itself.\n\nGame is very good in music,  graphics is nice too.
