The neon-colored characters on a white menu took me aback at first but I quickly adjusted. While short, the action was fast and busy. The targets changed every so often which kept everyone on their toes. My few complaints would have to deal with the level design. Each screen has a different look and feel to them, but some just don’t seem a good fit. The multiplayer is really competitive and a lot of fun.All in all, Chompy Chomp Chomp was a fun and amusing game. The pace and action kept everything fun but it’s best to bring 3 others friends along if you wish to experience the full potential of this title. A nice buy if you want to have a fun and fast session with friends or family.","July 8, 2014","true","5.6"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","24","29","0","0"

If you want a myriad of playing options and a wealth of choice, this is not the game for you. The single player arcade mode is weak, but is at least expanded with co-op mode.\n\nAt it's local multiplayer heart, it's good fun though. It's frantic and a good take on the Bomberman game, while remaining pleasantly simple and looking pretty good. However, it is severely lacking in some areas - there is no online multiplayer which is a big misstep and I would have liked more modes in the game as there's only so much you can do with points and time.\n\nI wish there was a mixed feeling option for this game as there is certainly potential and if you play a lot of local multiplayer you will get a lot out of this as it's a blast. On the other hand, there's so much that could have been done to make the game better rather than a lazy single player mode, and if that's the sort of thing you like about games you're not going to have a good time.\n\nBased on my preferences, this *just* earns a recommendation but wholly conditional on if you like local multiplayer. I hope the devs do a lot more with this title as the potential is there - they just need to capitalise on that.","May 17, 2014","true","1.6"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","24","33","0","0"

Battle mode is... battle mode is VERY frantic. It's played on very small stages with your characters being fairly large targets. I think that with friends, it would be humorous. But Arcade was worth it to me. I had fun switching colors, getting alternating chains, trying to beat the darn thing twice through... then three times through because hey, why not, it's like beating Dig Dug three times through, you do it just to increase your score, and because the gameplay appeals to you! Chompy Chomp Chomp's gameplay appeals to me. For the most part, it is exactly what it says it is: an arcade game. There's a simple yet challenging gameplay system, fun score multipliers and awesomely useful powerups, and increasing difficulty with harsher time rewards on subsequent playthroughs.

Everyone is trying to eat one another, and you have to run from the player trying to eat you while also running after another player you are designated to eat. The more you eat other players the more points you get. That's about it....\n\nThere is also a short lived Arcade mode, where you basically go around trying to eat organge, and purpose blobs while avoiding a big black blob. You have a time limit that carries over from every stage so it's basically "how far can you get before the time runs out", and the "levels" are basically the same each time.\n\nThe only positive about this game is that it may be a fun "party" game if you have 4 people to play with, however I feel that even with people it would only last about 5-10minutes before you get bored of the repetition.","May 21, 2014","false","1.3"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

Well if so Chompy Chomp Chomp may be for you!\n\n“Chompy Chomp Chomp is a game where people of all ages, tastes and skills can play together, and enjoy themselves on a level playing field. Play with your friends/kids/boss/gran, lose your inhibitions, shout and scream and generally have an awesome time.”\n\nGameplayRemember in Pacman when you used to run away from the ghosts and when you got fruit you’d chase them back? Well imagine that on a much faster, crazier scale! You play as a little chomp and your goal is to eat everything and anything in the time allowed. You have a glow around the base of your character which indicates who your next target is, watch out though because someone is always after you too!\n\nTop TipThis may seem like common sense but trust me when I say you ever the basics go out the window when playing. So our top tip would be keep an eye on whos after you, and don't get caught in a dead end.\n\nPower-UpsAs with many great games power-ups are involved in the fun, they have various different uses. Some teleport you to a random spot, others make you run fast and some create confusion for other players. We like to aim to get a teleport and when your stuck, out of lucky activate it to keep going.\n\nGraphic StyleWhat’s nice about this if its got a nice, clean style but if the default isn’t enough you can play in multiple styles around many levels.\n\nView Blog Posted - Indie Game of the Week[www.dabs.com]","September 3, 2015","true","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I picked this up on a whim (while it was on sale I think) and was not disappointed.   It isn't exactly a deep game but if you ever enjoyed playing pac-man or mouser back in the old days you might just find this little game to be fun for a while.  It has player vs player and co-op gameplay however it's local only and there's no online play through steam.","May 13, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
