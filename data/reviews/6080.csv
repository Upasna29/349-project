Parks to play all with 3 areas with totally different genres. the 5 parks are, Thrillville Stunts, the Starter park based on action (duh),Which contains the areas Throttleville, Battleville,and Saddleville (cowboys). then there is Thrillville Explorer, which contains Relicville, Summitville, and Scurvyville ( WOO PIRATES!!!!!). then Thrillville Other worlds, with Uragiville,Astroville, and Oceanville. Thrillville Giants is next, with Candyville,LawnVille, and Casaville.

(Edited to stop people freaking out :))\n\nGraphics: The game is kinda old now so the graphics are dated but they are fitting for this game and if changed, would ruin the game and for that the graphics make the game unique.\n\nAudio: The audio for the game are funny to listen too, helpful to listen and also really relaxing and extremely entertaining.\n\nControls: Controls are extremely simple to get used too and really cannot judge or anything. Super amazing.\n\nHe best thing about this game is the mini games. You create a massive theme park and you are able to interact with everything from cleaning up litter to entertaining the crowd to riding a roller coaster to playing the arcade games.\n\nI have no problems with this game and is worth the money you pay for it.","January 2, 2014","true","14.0"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","9"

Seeing as how I currently don't have access to a PS2, I had to get OTR on Steam. It's a very fun game, and well worth some of your time. It's similar to Rollercoaster Tycoon, but Thrillville concentrates on more of the theme park in general rather than just rollercoasters (although those are still fun as hell). Managing a theme park is made perfect and simple in Thrillville. While there are definitely some downsides (limited energy for each park??), I think OTR is one for the books.","August 14, 2013","true","4.6"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","15","15","2","0"

Especially great if you played it on PS2 a while back when it came out.  Not as fun these days, but I find myself playing it longer than I thought I would.\n\nPros:\n-The rollercoaster building system is great, kind of weird at first, but if using a controller, it becomes easier.\n-Since it's a PS2 game, there's nothing to buy, no DLC.  Everything's included.  The arcade games could be full games with a little modifying.  They're not just thrown in, they're nicely thought out, and they're fun.  One's even a 3D flying game, with great controls.\n-Can talk to guests.\n-Custom rollercoasters.\n-Run around your park in third person.\n-Interesting parks\n\nCons:\n-Power Meter gets annoying.\n-INVERT CAMERA MEANS THAT IN THE FLYING GAME, YOU HAVE UNIVERTED CONTROLS ON THE LEFT STICK.  WHY.\n-No decorating like RCT.\n-Can have only one of each arcade game, but that's fine because of the power meter annoyance.\n-No landscaping like RCT.\n-Customization could be better, but it was a PS2 game, though the PC version -could- have been upgraded in some way.  Though, looking at the date of the game, I really can't blame it too much.  What could have been added to make it better?  Not anything I can think of without changing the game entirely.\n-No tunnels for rollercoasters.\n-Only building in predetermined areas.\n\nOverall:\nA fun game with not much in the way of you and having fun.  Even though I said there were all these flaws, it's fun.  And they're only really "flaws" because I'm used to RCT.","December 26, 2015","true","30.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I bought it because of nostalgia, and I play it for fun. Thrillville OTR is challenging and offers a wide variety of minigames and tasks while you build and customize many different theme parks. The story is fine, I don't particularly care for it much. A sappy corporate rival park builder is a threat to stealing your visitors and you have to just build better parks and show "Globo Joy" who's boss.\n\nI personally dislike the high graphics setting because it makes the character models look creepy. I recommend putting graphics down a notch and disabling voice. It gives a more classic feel to it and it also forces you to actually read the dialogue, which I actually rather do. Check this one out. Ten bucks and it's basically 35 games in one. Can't go wrong!","September 21, 2014","true","37.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I do love this game, but the controls have made me rage quit multiple times now.\n\nSeriously, for about 80% of the mini games, the controls are so delayed it makes beating the game missions insanely difficult. I use both an Xbox 360 controller and a mouse + keyboard, yet there is a 2-3 second delay, or the game will just not respond at all.\n\nThis only occurs in the mini games, so i know it isn't on my end. I can run around the park and build coasters just fine, but i can't finish all the missions due to certain mini games being just being impossibly difficult with these awful controls.\n\nThis game is so great and I just want to play the hell out of it and soak in some nostalgia. Yet, I can't recommend due to the state of the controls.","January 27","false","6.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

It's not a bad game.\n\nPros:\n-- Like the first one, the game is great for kids. It's simple and easy to learn. Most of it is social interaction and fulfilling ride challanges.\n\n-- Interaction with all aspects of the park. Whether it's training employeess managing park finances, or playing minigames, you can still control your park.\n\nCons:\n--This is EXACTLY like the first game. The mechanics haven't changed at all and I felt like I was paying for an expansion more than a sequel. It actually got rather boring.\n\n--Lack of freedom with rides. This was the same problem with the first game. SimCoaster, SimTheme Park, and RollerCoaster Tycoon didn't force you to build only in dedicated zones as well as have a "power" bar to limit your complexity on the park, making ride creativity less than fun because you always had to worry about power management.\n\n\nFor the TL;DR: this game is exactly like the first one. If you want a game that's fun for kids, buy it. If you want a better amusement park game in nearly every single aspect, buy Rollercoaster Tycoon, SimTheme Park, or SimCoaster.","November 3, 2014","false","4.1"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","5","14","0","4"

Their facial expressions were creepy and they constantly repeated lines. The mini games didn't have very good instructions so things didn't make sense. For example the dance mini game didn't really explain what the symbols actually meant and how to hit some of the directions (if that made any sense). Overall, the game is actually very good and addicting. You get to create your character and even name him/her. For some reason children can also manage the theme park. The missions were really well done and it gave me something to do in the park if I got bored. Also, the game uses REAL music instead of music specifically designed for the game. For example they used Natasha Bedingfeild's (I think I misspelled it) Unwritten song and Toby Mac's "I'll be for You." The only major problem with this game is the character sprite design and the lack of explanation in the mini games. Keep in mind this is really just a cheap version of Roller Coaster Tycoon with a story line. Granted it is worth $10 and I would recommend this game for you or a friend.","February 28, 2015","true","38.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Originally had it on the Wii, and the controls are quite a bit different on the PC but that doesn't matter since they're so simple anyways. Most of the missions are a lot of fun and you can get quite creative when creating the WHOA-coasters!\n\n9/10 would recommend.","June 16, 2015","true","21.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You basically build themeparks, eack park has three different themes to choose from, there are also mini games and side missions and of course building rollarcoasters. Its not as detailed as RTC or anything but that actually plays to the games strengths and you never get bored since there are plenty of other things to do besides build. I loves the original for PS2 but the PC port of the sequel works very well.","May 28","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
