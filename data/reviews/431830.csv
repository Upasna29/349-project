You found yourself on a ship all alone and have to survive basically. Reminded me a lot of the movie The Martian to be honest. The game is still in Early Access so they’re improving it all the time.\n\nGraphics :\n\nThe graphics are average, nothing fancy the FPS is good and game runs smooth.\n\nSound :\n\nThere isn’t any music or voice acting in the game other than the one line at the start of the game. Only your footsteps and the breaches’ alarms going off is all you’ll hear. I guess it adds to the lonely atmosphere.\n\nGameplay :\n\nThe gameplay involves you running around the ship fixing breaches and in the process keeping up your basic needs such as hunger, thirst, morale, oxygen etc. It’s a good concept and the atmosphere of the game really gives that all alone in space scary feeling.\n\nYou have to survive the days, as a day goes past you get new breaches such as fires, and atmosphere leaks, you have to fix those, you can find them by looking for alarm cues and sort of like a waypoint which tell you where the breach/broken thing is. After fixing you then have to concentrate on keeping yourself healthy by going to the medical rooms and getting in the med pod to heal your diseases, they can also be healed with medicine . Once you’re done with fixing breaches and eating food water, there’s basically nothing much to do after other than wait for the 24 hours to be over and to do all that all over again. Surviving isn’t hard at all because there’s plenty of supplies all over the ship.\n\nOne annoying thing in the game is the lack of a minimap, I know there are plenty of maps all over the ship which tell you where you are currently but a minimap is always helpful especially if the rooms and the ship looks the same everywhere you go.\n\nThough there is many bugs but that’s expected as the game is still in Early Access and many bugs should be fixed by the developers. The most annoying bug I ran across was when I adjusted FOV to be a bit wider FOV kept increasing automatically and the viewmodel and the onscreen menus became so small that they were unreadable. So I had to keep adjusting the FOV to be able to read the menu not to mention the wider FOV makes everything look weird even at 80 FOV. Yea, imagine doing that everytime you want to look in your inventory and/or check your health status.\n\n\nGraphics: 6/10\nSound: 2/10\nGameplay: 6/10\nOverall: 5.5/10\n\nConclusion :\n\nThe game is not bad but it can be improved a lot and more interesting mechanics can be added. Bug fixes should be fixed and some sort of story should also be added. If you like survival games you should give it a try otherwise I’d say wait for the game to come out of Early Access and/or sale on the game.","April 20","true","2.2"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","17","20","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nerney9/recommended/431830/","Nerney9","Nerney9","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nerney9/","4742 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEARLY ACCESS review, 6/1/16\n\nShort Version: A lonely, barren, poorly rendered spaceship crumbles around you as you futilely try to patch up your broken little world just enough to survive the inevitable decay, prolonging your lonely, barren, poorly rendered existence for one more day.  First-Person-Survival that might work as an art piece for the meta 'feels'... but not so much as a full fledged game.\n\nDrift into Eternity is a survival game that puts you in the shoes of the only wo/man alive on a spaceship that is falling apart a little more every day.  You must scavenge supplies from all around the ship to fix up the hull breaches, fires, and broken life support systems that crop up in greater numbers every day as you try to survive in hopes of a rescue that may never come.\n\nThe game's hook is interesting, and it certainly has potential to become a game worthy of playing, but in its current early access state it unfortunately lacks the content a $15+ game is usually expected to deliver.\n\nThe graphics aren't great, and even the current bland-ish visuals caused numerous hitches on my machine. The audio is equally mediocre at this point, consisting of a lone voice telling you about objects when you press the tutorial button, the constant rumbling of your spaceship, and the ubiquitous wailing of sirens as things break down around you.\n\nThe gameplay itself just doesn't have enough substance at the moment to retain interest.  You open endless containers (which usually don't resemble containers or have any highlights or animations to mark them as such), 'take all' of the endless parts, then hunt down an endless number of broken/smoking/flaming things and right click to fix.  Meanwhile you must eat/drink/self-medicate just enough to stay alive....endlessly.  This repetition definitely adds to the atmosphere of desperate futility the game seems to be going for, but doesn't provide much in the way of entertainment value (which ironically, is one of the things you have to do to survive in the game - keep your character entertained).\n\nAll in all, Drift Into Eternity has an interesting concept that could be neat to try, but probably not at the current point in development or at the current price.  However, the developers do seem to be very active, patching things frequently along with providing a clearly labeled timeline of what they hope to achieve in the next six months  - and visibly active development is a definite positive for an Early Access title.  So, if the concept of the game intrigues you, you could consider supporting the development of the game and hoping for the best... but if you're searching for a survival game to fully enjoy now, you may want to keep looking.\n\n\nReceived a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes.

I understood the idea: survive at all costs being alone in a space ship full of cargo and look for those things you need for maintenance spread in the whole ship.\n\nI loved the intro music, the piano, makes me feel great. There's no so much noise in a lonely spaceship except the sound of your stems and the alarms of a fire or a breach. The visual experience is quite good, maybe there are some things need to be polished, of course, I'm playing the game in early access mode. I guess I'll have more to discover soon.\n\nGameplayBeware of poison food! The game is simple: survive, and you'll have to eat and drink and use vaccines if you get a cold, a bandage if you are wounded, etc. Also, you have to distract yourself a little, so there are books, yoyos, vodka and other things spread in the rooms. Use them. There is a log that tells you the everyday maintenance ship status, also your hunger and thirst status. You will be able to check the oxygen level and other important things like fires and breaches. At options you'll be able to see all commands, that's helpful.\n\nAgain, beware the poison food, some of the food and drinks are poisoned and you will have to look for the cure. You don't want to get poisoned if you have to survive for 15 days on that ship.\nSometimes I felt a kind of "lack of action". I'm not saying I have to run all the time but days can be a little longer without something to do.\n\nI liked the "Star Trek" touch. In the cabins, you'll see the Enterprise in a poster. Also, if you look like the ship looks a little like the old constitution class.\n\nPros+ Great environment for a ship\n+ Lovely intro music\n+ Difficult to pass, like that\n+ The Star Trek touch\n\nCons- The graphics effects should be polished\n- The voice at the beginning should be a recording or nothing, sounds very off topic\n- There are not so many things to do\n- A lot of items you don't know what are used for\n\nFinal ThoughtsThis game has potential. If you look for a survival adventure escaping from crazy aliens this is not your game. But, if you look for a good environmental and realistic immersion and maintain a ship in conditions, this is definitely your game.\n\nRating:8/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games.\n","March 24","true","7.7"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","9","18","0","0"

You are the sole survivor of a crash-landing on an unknown planet. The good news – well, you are alive! The question is, for how long? Your spaceship has sustained a lot of damage and as days goes by, more breakages occur!\n\nDrift Into Eternity is a First Person survival game set in a fallen spaceship. At the start, you will wake up in your personal cabin and learn the basic functions of the game. Then you will be advised on how many breaks the vessel suffered on a daily basis via the logbook. You might have some specific equipment to fix or even to extinguish fires in several rooms. You will be able to identify where the breaks are located by the flashing red lights and the sound of the alarm in front of the room where the repairs are needed. Green smoke is also a sign of damage, so make sure you go through the area with a fine comb.\n\nA small point I forgot to mention is that you start with absolutely nothing on you, and not only do you have to repair the ship but you have to make sure you find enough food and water to survive another day in this grim environment! Be aware of the rotten food which can cause you illness and make sure that your state of mind is at its optimum by reading comic books, magazines or listening to music. Try to stock as many useful items as possible in your inventory, so when you come across equipment to repair you hopefully have the right component to fix it.\n\nThe vessel has two decks that you can explore and you will have to find a teleporter to move from one deck to the other. Remember to read your log book carefully as damage can occur on both decks on a same day. One thing that I miss in this game is a mini-map; sure you have maps of the ship on the walls here and there, but I find it to be not so helpful.\nThe graphics are average but the game runs very well. I like the Keyboard rendition before starting the game but there is nothing else in regards to the sounds apart from the sound effects, which are footsteps and alarms.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Great music intro\n-	Well-designed decks\n-	Plenty of items to find and use\n-	Achievements\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	No mini-map\n-	Graphics need to be polished (Early access)\n-	No trading cards\n\nThis game is currently in early access and shows good potential. I look forward to see more updates.\n\n7/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.
