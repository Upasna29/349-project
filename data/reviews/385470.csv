No sandbox mode or even a map editor. It has nothing to do with modeling at all.\nAll you do is pick an engine, pick your freight or a passenger car and go in a cricle from station to station loading/unloading. The only thing you do control is start/stop the train and the switches.\n\nGranted it is only $5, but you are not getting anything for it at all. I played the first two scenarios and maybe the game does get better, but I got bored. Since there is no table view having more than one train is pointless, because you have stop all other trains to be able to concentrate on one.","July 10, 2015","false","0.4"," 83 of 87 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","83","87","3","0"

You buy a loco and cars, drive the train around in circles between stations dropping off and picking up passengers (don't incur a penality!) one ONE screen and THAT IS IT. It's like model railroad used to be. Track/train/power mindless circling of the track.\n\n\nNO sandbox, NO track laying, NO POINT.  This is a good game for say a five year old but for adults it's insulting.\n\n\nThe game is awful.  Please do not spend your money on it.\n\n\nThanks for reading.","July 10, 2015","false","0.8"," 61 of 65 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","61","65","5","5"
