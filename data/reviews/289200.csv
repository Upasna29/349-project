"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RussianInquisitor/recommended/289200/","RussianInquisitor","Reflaugh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RussianInquisitor/","428 products in account","This used to be my favourite game when i was a child. I bought it after beatin Warcraft 3, and loved it a lot. I also replayed it a few times and enjoyed it every time. About a year ago i tried to play Kings bounty, but enjoyed it a lot less than this game. Maybe it's nostalgia, but i really love that in this game every unit is separate, when in KB it's just one unit with the number. It makes it a lot more fun for me.\nThis game may have bad graphics, but does this even matter? It's best part is the fighting system. It's not too long, so i didn't get bored with figths, which are, by the way, pretty different each time. If you played KB, you should know what i'm talking about. In Ascension it also matters how many units you put into one cell. It may be 1 weak soldier, which can be a bait, or a group of them. In the second scenario the group is more likely the distract the enemy, they can even protect more important units with their own bodies, which you couldn't do in KB, but the also can be destroyed by one hit of the wizard, while putting them into separate groups makes it longer to take them all down.\nThe rpg part is not very developed, this is true. There is no skill tree or anything like that. But if you choose to be a wizrd, which is a wise choise, you definatly will enjoy finding new spells, like triple fireballs or distraction. Most of them can be bought learned from wizards in towns, but some, like fast travel spell, are hidden on the map. However, if you want the game to be more challanging, make your hero a warrior and don't learn spells.\nThe world is divided into three continents. The land of humans, the land of orcs and barbariabs and the land of demons. Each of them is full of characters, secrets and side quests. It's really interesting to explore in ths game. If you do, you may find a worthy treasure.\nSide quests in this game are rather small, but more interesting, than just "kill-bring" ones. There are such quests as drinking competiton, detective quest. In most of those you can express your will. For example, in the detective quest you can either punish the criminal you find, or take his money + keep  him available as a merchant.\nThere are also several items in this game, which cost a lot, A LOT of money. You'll have to complete some side quests in order to buy them. Those are armour, rings etc. Funny thing: you won't be able to buy some items. Merchants will tell you that they are no use for you. They are actually useful for a main caracter of the sequel, which is sadly not on steam. Those items are easter eggs of some sort.\nI found the plot interesting. The final battle is pretty epic. Plus there are some interestings parts of the main quests, in which you, for example, will have to get rid of all your weapons and armour, your whole army too, and dress as a monk in order to enter a city, taken over by a demon. Hten you'll have to fight him without all things you left behind. If you're a wizard - it's difficult. If you're a warrior - good luck.\nThe in-game journal is done decently. It doesn't say "kill 10 rats, dragonborn". The notes in it always fit the atmosphere, and, if you read them, may contain useful hints.\nI definatly recommend this game.","April 23, 2014","true","22.0"," 107 of 119 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","107","119","0","1"

It is a tad difficult at the beginning when your hero is too weak but then becomes quite enjoyable as things balance out a bit.  By about 1/3 of the way through you are becoming so powerful that the battles are pretty much a joke.  A few minor tweaks and the story, battles, and overall gameplay would shine.  It is pretty much set up so that whoever acts first in the battle comes out on top.\nAll the same, it was 15-20 hours of decent fun.","May 5, 2014","true","23.4"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

The game is fun, it's very playable even with old graphics, engine, bugs etc. They don't matter, it's fun and can be playind over and over with different combat style.

If you are concerned with graphics then look at the pictures before you buy(I think the graphics are decent but not up to date). If you are having trouble in the beginning read some guide or walkthrough before you decide the game is bad or to hard. Exploring and finding the shrine looking things and enemies to fight makes the game easier. You generally want bonuses to authority if you have a choice between bonuses unless you want the game to be pretty hard. Making your character a mage or using good ranged troops probably makes the game easier.","April 26, 2014","true","21.3"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

Overall the story is quite good.\n\nHowever, I feel as if the game was rushed towards the end because their was such a lack luster of side quest content.

Normally i love turn based game, but this game is really bad for some reasons:\n\n1- Zero personalizzation. No leveling of the troups and you can only chose if being a warrior or a mage. 4 equipment slots (2 rings, an amulet and equipment). In a game like this it is the basic.\n\n2- It starts with a great idea (a king teleported to another region, quite naked), but the subquests are pointless. You are in a long straight way and you have to kill everyone and everything. That's all. If you took the quest you can have some gold bonus but nothing more.\n\n3- the control system is terrible. The camera is really too slow, and your control in the battle is quite none (if you have a strongest army you win, if equal is a matter of luck or bad AI, if lower you have no chance at all). Over that, the autosave system is terrible ... sometimes it saves after the beginning of a battle and if you can't win that battle is better that you have a close savegame ... this mean that you have to save by yourself, it's far better.

The battle loads, the enemies go first and lots of wolves or dogs or something just surround my main character and eat him. Game over. I couldn't even click once in that battle. I guess maybe you can load and juggle around which units go in which army slots and maybe not get killed instantly, but my patience ran out after that. Consider carefully how much you spend on this outdated budget title. Also: the game lacks a proper tutorial.","April 26, 2014","false","0.4"," 14 of 37 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","14","37","2","5"

I thought it was one of the best games I ever played. And my mind hasn't changed about it one bit, playing it again I still feel how good the gameplay is.\n\nEven back then the graphics were quite bad, especially the CGI movies, they look like they were made in the late 90's. But that didn't phase me one bit, the turn based battle gameplay won me over instantly. And the fact that you are constantly improving your army and recruiting new and better units is just nonstop fun.\n\nThe turnbased battle system is similar to the Might & Magic games, however the way Ascension to the Throne does its battles is much more engaging and feels like an actual battle and not just a representation of it.\n\nThe game has definetly aged, I would love nothing more than to buy a remake or a sequel. But that day will most likely never come, it is just one of those games that will be lost in obscurity but I will continue loving it just the same.\n\n8 / 10","March 21, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was a bit short(I beat it in about 24hours played) but thats still good fun for only $2.99, and I got it when it was on sale for $1.01.  The beginning of the game is a bit tough, but I liked the challenge.  By the end it was a bit too easy.  On the final continent that you explore, I think all the fights I got in I won without any losses to my army, with the exception of the final fight of the game, in which I lost about 30% of my force before winning.  It was still interesting to get to get end despite getting a bit too easy.","December 4, 2015","true","24.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm happy that steam made a compatible version.\n\nDon't expect anything fancy in the technical sense - graphics weren't awesome even when the game was new and there's no voice acting, but it doesn't matter. The game is pretty stable, I found just one bug: a big guy sends you to find a key, but you already have it by the time you talk. Talking to him again later will crash the game. Also, the auto-save feature is not always hepful: it's supposed to save before a battle, at the point when you can choose not to attack, but sometimes, it saved right in the first turn of the battle. And choosing your battles is essential, especially at the beginning.\n\nYou - the king od Airath - get betrayed by your court mageand hit with a spell that should kill you. It only breaks your armor, though, and deposits you somewhere far away, in a land called Oganthar, alone and unarmed. Oganthar doesn't have a king, the lands are divided between seven Lords (six, actually, plus one Lady). And since you can't return home in your current state, you decide to unite Oganthar and raise an army to take back your lands.\n\nEasier said then done - you have a handful of hitpoints and hit about as hard as a peasant (the weakest unit in the game). You get some cash to hire an arrmy, but money is not really the limiting factor. Your Authority is. That's a stat, almost like a currency, which you need to command troops. Unlike King's bounty, here every unit takes up a bit. Also, units are not available for hire in infinite Numbers, so you need to optimize a bit. You also get XP and level up fairly often (lvl 50+ at the end), so don't worry, you'll get more than the initial six peasants. You can inprove your physical damage, but there's no point playing as a fighter. You still need to move around the battlefield to hit someone and you only hit one enemy with your sword. With a spell, you can kill a whole stack at once, so you'll end up leveling your magical power.\n\nStacks work differently than most turn-based fights. You have space for ten stacks in your army (one of them being you, so nine, really), each with max ten units. "Units" come in all shapes and sizes - humans (melee and shooters), animals, undead, giants. Yes, you can have giants in your army. Yes, they are as awesome as it sounds. In actual combat, you don't see stacks like in HOMAM, you see each individual unit - but you control the stacks. You fight on a hex grid and your (and enemy) units are smart enough to go for the most kills. So, if your archers do 50 damage each and the enemy monsters have 51 hitpoints, your nine archers will kill four monsters and heavily wound a fifth one, rather than wounding ten monsters and leave them standing. All units have a Speed stat, which determines hw far they can move on a turn, but also how soon they attack. Killing the faster enemies will make your life easier and if you do it right, you can kill all oposition before they get a chance to do anything.\n\nThe beginning is a bit frustrating - you are pretty much too weak for any battle, so you have to pick your fights carefully.  The game ends if you are killed and since you have no armor, that can happen very easily. Some early quests give you some extra units beyond your Authority limit, so you can get something done. And when you get organized, you;ll find the game is pretty well balanced. By the time you find tougher enemies, you can also hire more and tougher units. And when you finish uniting Oganthar and turn homewards with your army of Furies, Dragonslayers and Knights of the Sun, you feel pretty invincible. Don't worry, you'll be proven wrong, soon enough.\n\nThe story is nothing to write home about, but also not terrible. The whole game took me about 13 hours to finished and I think I'll come back.","November 17, 2015","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
