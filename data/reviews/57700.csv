The game can be pretty challenging sometimes, but not so difficult that you just give up. The cutscenes tend to be pretty humorous. If you take this game seriously, you're doing it wrong. The music is good and the art style is fitting. One gripe, the game almost requires a controller to play. The game will only let you move in four directions with the keyboard, so good luck beating the game. If you have a console controller, it is worth every bit of that small investment you have to make.","November 27, 2013","true","2.9"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","0"

With a quirky storyline straight out of a dimestore comic book, this game is filled with win. You are invincible, but the world around you is not. Don't let the doom beasts past or the city (and your ultra egotistical image) will be hurt, and there is only so much they can take.

The theme fits the mechanics well.  An invincible avatar fends off invaders before they can pass into the populace.  It's less about dodging bullets than shooting or bashing through targets.  While the special move limitations are explained away with a character flaw, it works.\n\nOptions are limited.  There is no windowed mode.  Keys can't be adjusted within the game.  Xbox 360 controllers are supported, but the B button's cancel operation is essentially the Esc button.  This hurts during play because it's easy to unintentionally pause or even erase progress in the current level.","November 23, 2011","true","6.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The graphics are sharp (and look cool), it reminded me a lot of Alien Hominid. The game itself is, like I said, pretty good but straightforward. You just press and hold Space to shoot, ocassionally press X to use your powers and Control to grab bigger enemies (and press Space some more). The goal is to keep enemies from flying past you. If you let 50 pass, it's game over. If you can keep them off you're awarded a medal. So nothing groundbreaking.\nHowever, I wish there was a little bit more variation in enemies (and enemy designs as well). But it's a solid game nonetheless. Would I recommend it ? No. Unless you're really into shoot 'em ups, that is.\n\n[Rating: 62/100]","July 20, 2011","false","0.4"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

As you let more and more aliens get by the cityscape in the background gets more and more destroyed.  My only major problem with the game comes from the fact that you're invincible.  It makes the game seem too easy.\n\nThe reason you get good at a Bullet-hell shmup is to survive and advance in the game.  If you mess up, you die and the game ends.\n\nWhen you get good at WTF, you get gold medals.  If you mess up, you get a silver or bronze.\n\nI guess I'd recommend it if you're looking for something different, but only at Steam Sale pricing.","January 3, 2015","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just an old school 2D flying game with a few quirks.  A bit short - at 90 mins I had already beat the game Silver/gold score on all levels and beat several of the challenge levels (not all.)  I played with a 360 controller - I recommend this game with a controller, without it - perhaps it would just make you upset.  This game is basically a super flash style 2D shooter.

If you can get it really cheap or free, it's worth it for the 20 minutes of fun you'll have.\n\nThe being an invincible shooter thing is  a nice twist, though the controls (on keyboard anyway) are horrendous. That being said, most of the enemies really try to annoy you instead of providing a legitimate challenge.   i.e. if you get hit by the 2nd world boss, you lose the battle because you will just be stuck there until the timer runs out.  So then you have to start the level again and keep going until you get a perfect.","June 30, 2014","true","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RyanWells/recommended/57700/","RyanWells","The Hitman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RyanWells/","677 products in account","Who’s That Flying?! is a shoot um up games with a super hero theme. The story is basically that you are a wannabe superhero and have to prove yourself by defending various cities around the world. The story is very simplistic, but it is kinda funny in a cheesy way because the way the cutscenes are done. The voice acting is… weird. You can barely understand any of it so you mostly have to read the text. Of course, this is a good thing. I think indie devs need to realize that bad voice acting is far worse than cheesy voice acting, or even none at all. Other than that, let's focus on what is important here, the presentation and gameplay. The graphics are pretty gorgeous  honestly, and it really does help the theme of “silly”. The animations are solid as well. The gameplay is pretty par for the course, but it’s still very effective and fun. In Who’s That Flying?! you will be blasting your way through 15 levels, in 5 different cities. Each one is very different than the last, with different enemy types. At the last level for each city, you have to fight a boss. The bosses are pretty challenging, but not rage inducing. Who’s That Flying!? only has keyboard support, as well as gamepad. So yeah, unfortunately there is no option to use the mouse. The actual gameplay is fun, and the object it to shoot the enemies before they fly by you. You have no health in this game, but instead the city has health. Let enough of them fly by you, and you will lose and the city will be destroyed. you only have one blaster in this game, and there are no upgrades. It does reward you for combos though. You have a specials bar that fills up, so you can get more powerful lasers for a short 5-10 second period. You win each level by flying to the end, and eliminating all the baddies. The game is pretty short as you could imagine, and it only takes about 2 hours to beat the main story. There is a challenge mode and a infinite mode if you really like the game, but by the time i beat it in 2 hours and 30 minutes i was pretty much ready to be done with it. Overall, Who’s That Flying?! is a pretty great little budget SHUMP game. I can definitely recommend it even if you are only slightly into the genre. WTF is nothing special really, but certainly a solid entry in the somewhat dying SHUMP genre.","December 11, 2015","true","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Then becomes really engaging as the enemies start to shoot back and attention would need to be divided between dodging enemy attacks and landing your shots. If you're familiar with Touhou games, then Who's That Flying?! style of play should not be anything new.\nSome points I liked about this game is the good cartoon looks, challenging at times, and the simplicity yet fun aspects.\nThe only negative side of the game is that controls cannot be reassigned.","December 2, 2014","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Much more entertaining than I thought it'd be.  Nice controls and action, and I had no trouble playing with the keyboard.  The game does get progressively more challenging, but never overly so and never felt like grinding away doing the same thing over and over.  At the end I was thinking "that was hard enough" though  :-)\n\nCertainly worth catching.  8/10","August 3, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Getting a perfect in each stage is very rewarding. And just when you finish the main story of the game, a plethora of challenge stages opens up to be accomplished. Those challenges are really crazy! They put you in the most creative situations that really make you think about your strategy in blasting away the enemies.\n\nDear Wife:It’s actually a memorization/strategy game disguised as an action game but I don’t think that this would be something we can enjoy together for longer than a few minutes. It's a very fun game but I think we'd enjoy ourselves more with other memory/strategy games set in different genres.\n\nMy Last Thoughts: KEPT. It deserves a spot as it is one of the better games I played so far.\nEXHILARATING. Not one alien can pass through or else you’ll have to repeat the whole stage from the beginning in order to get a perfect score. This kept me on edge the entire game!

The endless waves of identical baddies are there, flying in bizarre formations, just waiting for you to blast them out of the sky.  What's different, however, is the sense of humor the game brings, and the fact that, unlike most shooters, your "ship" (in this case, a blaster-armed, showboating Guardian of Earth) is invincible!  Getting hit by the baddies doesn't kill you; it only slows you down.  This doesn't mean there is no consequence for failure, however; If you let the little Ravager aliens escape, they will devour part of the population of Earth.  Let 50 of them pass, and it's game over. And, like I said, if you do get hit by them, they will slow you down and prevent you from shooting for a brief time. Being invincible does make the character feel much more epic and powerful, though, unlike the old-school games where you pilot a fragile spaceship.","July 18, 2011","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
