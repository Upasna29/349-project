"http://steamcommunity.com/id/freelance_/recommended/304350/","freelance_","The Space Ferret","http://steamcommunity.com/id/freelance_/","283 products in account","The best zoo-tycoon game in my opinion. The WP series features heavily on realism, unlike the Zoo Tycoon series, although that series is good too. Animals look realistic, as are their AI behavior. It takes a while for babies to be born, unlike ZT where it apparently happens instantly. Food don't magically appear out of thin air to feed your animals. like in ZT. You need to place the proper facilities to make the food.\n\nWP 2 also focuses more on those rare/unknown animals, unlike ZT where they feature mostly well known/popular animals. I like this idea, because it lets people who play this game learn about animals they've never seen/or read about before. For example, there's the frilled sharks from the marine expansion. I doubt many people who aren't shark fans would know what they are.\n\nThe map isn't really set up like a grid (ZT again). You simply 'paint' the paths along the ground for your customers to walk on, which makes your zoo look more realistic if you're using stone or dirt paths for instance.\n\nOne thing I do like in ZT over WP2 though is setting up your habitats for marine animals. It's very easy to do in ZT but I find it frustrating to do the same in WP2.\n\nBoth zoo series are good, but if you want more realism in a zoo game, then WP2 is the way to go. With 150+ animals, realistic AI, along with loads of plants and attractions, etc, however, you should buy it anyway.","July 17, 2014","true","2.9"," 157 of 186 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","157","186","0","2"

I got the game on a sale with all the expansions, which gives cracking value and a really vast amount of content for the money.\n\nThe very real question is whether or not this game is better than Zoo Tycoon, which is a tough one to answer.\n\nZoo Tycoon 2 is without question more polished, less buggy and very enjoyable to play.\n\nHowever, Wildlife Park has masses of content, is cheaper, has more flexibility and an engaging realism.\n\nIn short, they are two quite different games so compliment each other quite well. I would definitely recommend getting the expansion packs for this as they are quite spectacular. On the whole I'd strongly recommend this and with some bug fixes it would probably beat Zoo Tycoon 2.","November 8, 2014","true","27.5"," 32 of 32 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","32","32","0","0"

Now I like it even more with the amount of content when the (very inexpensive) expansions/DLC were bought and added.\n\nThe landscaping tools allow you to make a very detailed park as far as habitat and such goes. However some of the tools are labelled oddly. I suppose in other games I am used to the 'flatten' tool when in this game it's called 'plateau' but it does the same thing, bringing everything up/down to the same level and flat. A little finicky sometimes as it can be difficult to make a nice small pond in enclosures for drinking/swimming (sometimes there's not enough of a flat spot to put the water pump in so you have to mess around a bit). And the different types of turf are marked by hardness which is a little weird to me. I know some of the species of animals would like certain trees in their exhibits from their country of origin but the animals and trees can be dissatisfied trying to share the same turf type. I don't like the whole bit about micro managing the foliage of the park on top of the animals. That feels a little awkward.\n\nGraphics are actually pretty decent, less cartoony than ZT 2 and (sadly) Wildlife Park 3. I am personally okay with the vast majority of them. Though I have one bug (not sure if anyone else gets this) where animals or people randomly turn invisible. They're still there and sometimes I find them by accidentally clicking on them. But you can't see them. You can see the 'meh' yellow smiley over their heads if they're somewhat unimpressed.\n\nI do hate that the staff all have their own building, and you have to strategically place said buildings to get the most work out of your employees. The buildings take up valuable real estate that could instead be used for decoration or more exhibit space. On the plus side, the workers are pretty dedicated and no major complaints about them, in my humble opion. It would also be nice if they combined several of the staff into 'the Maintenance guy'. Gardener/Handyman/Bin Man could probably be the same dude since their work tends to be more infrequent.\n\nI love the animal selection, though the Swiss Brown Cow is perm-invisible for me for some reason. You can create fairly interesting combinations of beasts for the most part, for mixed compatible exhibits.\n\nOverall I'd have to rate this game (with all extra content) an 8/10 and if they make a 4th game and don't fudge it up like the 3rd one, I'll be the first to flail and yell "Shut up and take my money!"","December 25, 2014","true","32.9"," 33 of 34 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","33","34","4","0"

It ends up looking rather ugly having these tall staff buildings every where. There should be 1 major staff building for the animal workers and another building for the maintenance staff. And you can employ how ever many staff you need from each building and then asign to them a task or area for them to work. I did work experience at a zoo when I studied land management and the staff get to other areas around the zoo by bicycle or use a ute or other vehicle if needing to transport stuff.\n\nI also dislike that you have to look after and watch the plants needs. That is not fun and I think it's unneeded. The plants should be alive but just classed as a decoration you don't have to look after like what they did in sims 3. Or at the very least I'd rather not have plants tell me they aren't happy and just have a gardener smart enough to look after them himself. So that I wont have to deal with the strangeness of plants telling me they aren't happy.\n\nI also can't figure out how to properly build a water habitat. The game never shows you how to. I end up flooding everything or when I try to lower the ground more I end up with the water deep down the bottom and a massive cavern at the top. Iam not likely to buy the marine world DLC as I hate building marine habitats they always work out wrong. With you having to make a big hole and put a pump in and the water never fills up to the top and it looks ugly.\n\nAnd underwater viewing tunnels don't work properly either.\nWhen you build it you have one of two options.. you can either build a one-way line into the pool which ends underwater, or build a true tunnel with two exits.\n\nIf you opt for one-way visitors enter your tunnel but exit underwater and then swim in enclosure heedless of risk; and then start getting angry because they are stuck.\n\nIf you opt for two-way the tunnel acts like an invisible barrier preventing any animals from crossing sides - effectively cutting your pool in half. I did not test to see if this barrier prevents attacks by one species on another. But I did test and proved that they would rather starve to death than go get food just 2m on other side of the under water tunnel. Further animals begged for fellows if split up by a tunnel but don't if both on same side of it. And this barrier effect remained true no matter how deeply underwater the tunnel was placed and how shallow the animal's swim parameters were.\n\nCould be more educational and have descriptions of the animals. Eg. Cheetah: a large feline of the felidae family which inhabits most of Africa and parts of Iran. It is the fastest land animal. It likes to hunt antelope etc.\n\nI am likely to get most of the DLC eventually, except marine or horses as don't like marine habitat building and just horses in a dlc seems boring to me.\n\nDespite the things I dislike this game overall is fun and enjoyable to play. I recommend it and give it 7/10.\nIt would of been an 8 but loses a point for things I dislike. Maybe If they make a much improved Wildlife Park 4 they'll make this one worthy of an 8 or higher.","February 14, 2015","true","80.7"," 27 of 27 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","27","27","2","0"

It has a very nice selection of animals, buildings, plants, and decorations, and the world building tools are actually a little more robust than the Tycoon series' in certain areas. I feel like the art direction of this game is also very good, tending to run a little more realistic than Tycoon's, which I personally enjoy. The animals themselves have nice enough personality and animation to them, and there's a wide variety.\nThat said, it does have some negative points. The buildings you need to care for your animals are large and a bit obtuse, and you need a lot of them. The whole 'plants have needs' thing is a neat idea, but in practice is nothing but irritating. The AI can be pretty wonky at times, with guests wandering off and getting lost or animals starving to death while staring at a trough overflowing with food. Luckily, these things are managable so long as you're paying attention, it's just more annoying than game-breaking.\n\nThat said, I think that if you're really into zoo sims, this is definitely up to par with its main competitors and is a solid game all around. I've put hours into my zoos and think it's definitely worth a buy.","February 10, 2015","true","34.4"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","23","23","0","1"

For children it is a definate thumbs up as that is the obvious target audience.  The game leads you by the hand every step of the way and the controls are extremely basic.  For adults it is a thumbs down for the same reasons.  Missions get repetative and boring, animations are the same as the controls, basic, and even for a game released in 2006 not good enough to satisfy the older gamer.  Another turn off is that even the plants appear to be sentient and tell you why they are not happy which again, is good for kids but not for adults.  My four year old loves the game but my six year old prefers ZT2, as do I.  make of that what you will.\n\nI should also point out that the expansions do not appear to blend seamlesly with the original game but are rather stand alone products.  i bought the ultimate edition and have 7 seperate games to play, all of which have their own settings etc.","July 20, 2014","false","7.5"," 40 of 62 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","40","62","0","0"

First, you have to pick the environment you want. From Costa Rica to Himilayas (heck, even a crater). Then, you have to build your whole zoo from scratch. No, not one of those crappy iphone apps where you get a colossal enclosed area and you just tapped on animals to feed them (and somehow get money from the animals), you have to actually BUILD it.\nThis brings me to one of the bad things about the game; The prices are insanely off-bordered. A pig costs 10 dollars, while an extremely rare Napoleon Wrasse from a DLC costs 48 dollars. In real life, the Napoleon Wrasse would cost thousands.\nAnyway, after you start adding pens, you can put animals. They start off pretty hungry and possibly near-death, so what do you do? Either abuse the system and buy 1,000 lemon trees for cheap, or get a greenhouse for 500 dollars.\nOnce you get an entrance, you can open up the zoo for visitors.\nBrings me to another bad thing; every visitor is so picky I can't even laugh about it.\nIf you have the Crazy Zoo DLC, every single kid will not stop whining about wanting to climb something. Sometimes, I just put them in with some monkeys and tell them to climb the monkey slide. It's so annoying.\nYou can put a wide variety of machines for visitors to use, like vendors, shops, and other stuff to take all of their money. Then, they complain to you that they ain't got no money. What do you do? Well, you have them take your money from an ATM and re-pay the same amount! YAY!\nAlso, they want to pet the "cute" animals.

I read through all the reviews before making my purchase and even though there were negative ones, I decided I'd find out for myself exactly how horrible this game really is.  Well, I've come to realize that it's not horrible, but it's not great either.  It's just okay.\n\nI have always loved zoo builders and for some reason there's a serious shortage of them out there, so Zoo Tycoon 1 and 2 is pretty much up against Wildlife Park 1, 2, and 3.  I have played both the Zoo Tycoon games avidly and I hold it very dear to my heart, despite its discontinuation.\n\nThe Good-\n1) I love the amount of animals, but also the amount of out-of-the-box type of animals that came with the DLCs.  I liked the farm animals, the domestic animals, and the animals that are kind of used as "decoration" (Ducks, Butterflies, etc).\n2) The graphics are nice.\n3) I liked the animations of the people and animals.\n4) Unique buildings that are animal themed like horse stables.\n\nThe Bad-\n1) Graphics are buggy.  When I started my game up, I instantly saw black squares in place of some plants.  It went away when I zoomed in.\n2) The camera.  I always feel like I'm TOO zoomed in.\n3) Placing water was crazy ridiculous.  You need to dig into the ground then place a water pump and the water keeps filling to whatever level the pump was placed on.  It's just too complicated and to be honest, quite annoying.\n4) You can't build on a grid like other zoo games so your zoo ends up looking messy.\n5) NO BIOMES.  Nothing is organized into biomes so you have maybe 1 tree for your Savannah exhibits.  The animals like land based on "Hardness" which is just.. weird.\n6) Like I said, the menus are unorganized.  You have to hunt for the things your animals want through each menu and if you forget you have to navigate all the way back to the animal (yep, re-scroll and everything) to read their requirements again.  The animals aren't even organized.  Nothing is organized.\n7) No themed decorations.  You get maybe 2 flowerbeds and 2 statues.  So difficult to theme anything.\n8) The weather.  It might sound cool at first, having weather, but when it starts raining or snowing, suddenly EVERYONE and EVERYTHING is sad because they "Don't like the weather".\n9) Every time you want to place staff, you have to place a bulky and unattractive building.\n10) Buildings are nice looking, but seriously limited.  Decorations are the same way (as stated above).  For example, there are no restaurants.  Want to feed your guests?  Okay.. do they want to eat french fries and soda?  Because those are some of your main options.\n\nI want to add that Wildlife Park 3 is a much better game but I was attracted to the DLC packs for Wildlife Park 2.  I'll wait until they make DLC for Wildlife Park 3 and continue to support this developer even though I was disappointed in this game.  I love zoo builders THAT much and I think they're doing better and improving.  I will still play my zoo on Wildlife Park 2, even though the bad things I listed get seriously aggravating.","March 6, 2015","false","3.3"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

It's basically the same premise, after all. This game cannot be faulted for being less realistic than the ZT series, because it is, and that does add a little depth to the simulation.\n\nBUT.\n\nThe interface is far, far more clunky than ZT's, and some of the design decision are questionable. For example, each zookeeper you hire requires you to build him a special Zookeeper's Hut, which is a three-story-tall eyesore. And he can only handle about two enclosures, so prepare to build a lot of them. Also, some of their claims about number of animals are specious (You can't have Rabbits AND Bunnies.), and the overall assortment of things to customize the look of your zoo is FAR smaller than ZT (No flower beds? Really? And the entire list of statues I can build is 'Bear' and 'Panda bear'.)\n\nAll in all, I think ZT2 is a far better game, and kinda regret this purchase.","July 20, 2014","false","1.5"," 24 of 37 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","24","37","0","5"

In fact, had I known about these issues, I wouldn't have bought the game.  The main issue is that the expansions do not act as DLC.  They act as their own seperate games.  They show up individually in your library.  The base game does not contain missions or maps from the expansions.  In order to play with those, you have to start up that specific expansion.  However, the animals from the expansions seem to show up almost randomly between each other.  For example, the base game appears to have almost all of the animals (fish, dinos, dragons, etc) but appears to be missing certain specific species.  The expansions have the same issue; having certain species and not others.  You can fool around in the program files and condense most of everything into the base game but you will still be missing stuff.  And, I must point out, the animal color customization button in the base game doesn't work.\n\nAs for the actual game itself, it is alright.  There are aspects of it that are annoying (each employee has their own individual giant fugly tower, there isn't much variety in animal enrichment items, there aren't many items for guests, etc) but overall if you're looking to play something mindless for a while, Wildlife Park 2 isn't the worst choice.  It is certainly not as enjoyable as Zoo Tycoon, however, and if you're looking for an exciting, challenging simulation game, I would not choose this.\n","April 1","false","5.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

You need to have structures to harvest food for the animals, plants need care, and babies animals don't just pop out of nowhere, instead they have a gestation period or eggs are layed.\nStarter missions are fairly simple and do a good job of introducing you to the game machanics.\nThe only major thing I can complain about is the set up for marine habitats.

I owned it years ago and I put down any remembered flaws to hardware failures or thinking it was more difficult then it probably was. I bought the ultimate addition because I thought the marine life would be a nice addition to the game I used to play.................Two days in I have all the regrets for paying any amount of money for this. Animals are sometimes invisable. Swiss brown cow female is apparently just a shadow that moos. The animals make tons of loud rrepetitive noises constantly which is extra annoying purely because most of the missions are hurry up and wait. As the game won't run in the background I literally had to have the screen up and the game running for two hours to complete a mission after I saw to the needs of the animals.........make a better zoo while animals take the time to do their thing? can't. During missions you are locked out of most of the other features. The only reason to play the missions is because otherwise you will have no idea where or what some of the important items in the game are for sandbox mode. I still have no idea after to days how to properly build a water habitat, the controls are really seriously awful. Features seem broken. I have no idea if I am supposed to be able to change the coat color on some or all of the horses since they all look like they have that option but only two of them actually allow it. Can't make mixed animal pins easily because animals are SO picky about the surface they are on. Plants handling is a nightmare. I can't believe a game got this many expansions without them fixing some of the core world building issues.............in short I wish I had saved the money ordered a pizza and watched animal planet instead.....it would have been far less frustrating.","December 2, 2014","false","33.9"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","60","21","35","8","0"

The missions are good tutorials but they get very repetative. The interface is very clunky and the information about the animal is very vauge. This is not a zoo tycoon equivalent. The game(s) do feature different aspects that zoo tycoon didn't such as hardness level, amount of food, and weather conditions but I find those features limit the game experience instead of enhancing it. For instance I wouldn't be able to have a penguin and a dragon in the same zoo and would have to make a new save. The water placement is also an interesting mechanic but if you are going for an asthetic look is not great. The DLC only adds about 1-3 new animals which for $5 is a bit of a rip off. However compared to other zoo tycoon simulators I've tried this one holds up well.  If you are looking for something that isn't zoo tycoon and is fairly cheap then this game is okay but I reccomend looking into purchasing zoo tycoon itself (even if its expensive).","July 24, 2014","true","0.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I found the missions quite tedious, sometimes going longer than an hour (cough cough the infamous Ostrich Farm mission..). I enjoyed the diverse range of animals that were only increased with the multiple DLC that became available. The game (and DLC) are affordable, and I would not have paid anything more for a game like this. It's fun, you have compelte control of how you play and run your zoo (or Wildlife Park... but really it's a zoo). I like attention to detail, the animal textures are decent and the many life styles factors that affect the wellbeing of each individual animal made the experience more real, catering to each animals individual needs as well as their herd. The mating animations were humerous and I was shocked the first time I saw a pair of Ostrichs going hard at it.. especially when I had the game in fast forward mod.. However there are a few issues with this game. You cannot access all the DLC content in the Main Game, rather playing the individual expansions separetly. I would have liked to use ALL animals and facilities in the one game to make zoos more diverse nd unique, offering more animal types and experiences for the (very ♥♥♥♥ing needy) visitors. Another issue that has put me off the game is the fact about a third if not a half of the animals textures no longer work and instead you have an awkward giant ♥♥♥♥ign square. It's a mediocre game, it's fun to muck about on and can sometimes be addictive trying to make a kick ♥♥♥ zoo. However I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.","December 28, 2014","false","19.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I bought the full special pack of games from this series because it was on sale and I used to love Zoo Tycoon, so I wanted to play around in the game. The specs even have Windows 7 in the list of OS that can run this game... no dice.\n\nI can't even find an option to play this in compatibility mode, all of the tutorials for doing so show options on menus/properties that don't exist. The entire load-up screen is broken. I've never had a problem like this with a steam game, even Alpha/Beta versions of games. I assumed it would work because I trust Steam's selection of games. When I pay for a game on Steam, I expect it to work correctly without me having to go to great lengths to get drivers or updates or compatibility software or whatever it is I'm going to have to get in order for this game to work.\n\nI expect this kind of thing when I try to boot up my old Sims 3 cd, or even when I download Sims 2 FOR FREE because it's so old and incompatible. I didn't expect a perfect game - I expected glitches and old graphics, that would have been fine. But I did expect it to be functional.\n\nIt's not like I'm diving into the $5 game bin at Walmart and picked up a game from 1998. The game was released in 2006 and is available digitally, so why doesn't it work on modern OS? If I can't get a refund, this is going to have been a complete waste of money. How am I supposed to review a game I can't play? I actually have to mess around with the dysfunctional game-launch so that I can hit the minimum 5 minutes for "playing" a game in order to leave this review.

It has great fine tuned exhibit creation controls and the animal graphics have stood the test of time. Wonderful for kids, not so cerebral for adults so for me it's a good zen/casual game.\n\nIf you're looking for challenging scenarios and a financial manager, I'd look elsewhere. Zoo Tycoon is more challenging in terms of scenarios and managing finances all the while balancing animal happiness. You learn tips, tricks, and shortcuts for success while WP is pretty straight forward. WP2 does have some better defined realism, such as actual gestation time for animal pregnancies, but it's just plain easy to 'win' and turn constant profit.\n\nBoth games (Zoo Tycoon and Wildlife Park 2) are good, but not equivalent/don't have the same focus. ZT had better customization with its modding community and a better selection of items/objects/fences to place to match your aesthetic while Wild Park 2 has some aggravating graphical shortcomings (i.e. your animal keeper gate is always made of wood, even if the fence is made of concrete).\n\nBy and large, I like Zoo Tycoon better, but I don't regret purchasing or playing Wildlife Park 2.","October 27, 2015","true","24.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All those who have playd zoo tycoon should enjoy this game, and it is a bit more of a challenge to get things right. You don't just plonk things down and leave it and expect them to work, you have to maintain them as in real life. The controls are very similar to zoo tycoon2. The only drawback is that it's hard to please all guests and all seem to have something to moan about, but that aside, it is a great game.

To start with, I love Zoo Tycoon, even as an adult, so I figured that I'd enjoy this game.  And there are details about it that I DO like even better than Zoo Tycoon -- such as needing to wait for animals to gestate and training the animals.\n\nBut the controls are just so totally cumbersome that it's agonizing.  It's WORSE than the old controls to the original Zoo Tycoon.  There is no way to add gridlines on the terrain, so digging holes to place sea creatures in is a nightmare.  The zookeepers, trash guys, etc, all have these annoyingly small, diagonal zones -- which means you're placing workers every other exhibit.  The customers make me want to feed them all to the lions, because they're constantly demanding more plants, more food stands, more decorations, etc... even if it's only been 10 squares since the last food stand and they're three steps from a decoration.  Oh, and the decorations are (a) ugly and (b) extremely limited, so there's no satisfation in prettifying your park.\n\nHaving played through almost all of the missions now, I would not recommend this game.  I wish it was better, but it's just not.  Oh, and the fact that I CAN play through almost all the missions in a couple of hours also should warn people how easy it is.  It's just too bad there's so little satisfaction in winning.  :(","January 2","false","18.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has great fine tuned exhibit creation controls and the animal graphics have stood the test of time. Wonderful for kids, not so cerebral for adults so for me it's a good zen/casual game.\n\nIf you're looking for challenging scenarios and a financial manager, I'd look elsewhere. Zoo Tycoon is more challenging in terms of scenarios and managing finances all the while balancing animal happiness. You learn tips, tricks, and shortcuts for success while WP is pretty straight forward. WP2 does have some better defined realism, such as actual gestation time for animal pregnancies, but it's just plain easy to 'win' and turn constant profit.\n\nBoth games (Zoo Tycoon and Wildlife Park 2) are good, but not equivalent/don't have the same focus. ZT had better customization with its modding community and a better selection of items/objects/fences to place to match your aesthetic while Wild Park 2 has some aggravating graphical shortcomings (i.e. your animal keeper gate is always made of wood, even if the fence is made of concrete).\n\nBy and large, I like Zoo Tycoon better, but I don't regret purchasing or playing Wildlife Park 2.","October 27, 2015","true","24.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The interface is very much like any of them. This game has a lot of the stuff gamers wished Microsoft Studios had included in their zoo game.

So you may see polls to close or too far from each other. Other than that the game is easy to play or build in and does have some appeal to it that some will like.

Fewer animals, decor items, and landscape options, and none of the neat information that came with ZT2 animals and plants.  However there are a few innovations here that could be well incorporated into ZT2+, like temperature concerns, seasonal change, and bad weather.\n\nAlso fence building is sort of buggy.   I like being able to build any shape pen, but I'd also like to be able to snap walls to a grid when I want.   A few graphical issues come up as well - wall type mismatches, clipping problems.
