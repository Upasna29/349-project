Being Local Co-op only doesn't let the game down. You just need to make the call if it's viable for you. If you are a lone wolf, probably not worth getting this title. If you are a social butterfly this will be a real hoot!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/manicado/recommended/418360/","manicado","Meownic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/manicado/","269 products in account","Gurgamoth is an ‘unforgiving’ party game. The game excels (well only excels) when you have people who can play with you locally. Great for events when you have friends over as this game provides a brutal experience and dying seems a common experience when playing.\n\nPositives:\n+ Gurgamoth stays refreshing from it's awesome level designs and level interactions. Level hazards such as spinning blade and enclosing walls keep the players vigilant.\n+ Art style is great and reminds me of games such as Binding of Isaac.\n+ Soundtrack is really good and matches the tempo of the game well.\n+ Plenty of characters to choose from.\n\nNegatives:\n- No Achievements\n- No Single Player\n- No Multiplayer\n\nI feel though single player is a huge opportunity missed in this game. I am often playing games by myself as I dislike much social interaction. If the game had AI and some sort of single player mode it would be much more accessible for players like myself who are often alone.\n\nThe game really does shine as a party game though and if you do have a group of gamers you constantly play local games with then I’d highly recommend this game. If you are more Lone wolf like myself then I’d avoid it unfortunately.\n\nThe game is solid overall and for that reason I’d recommend it.","February 19","true","4.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

This is intended to be played with 4-players, and the social experience is what really adds to the game.","February 25","true","6.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

Sit down on a couch, grab a controller and become the one to awaken Gurgamoth.\nEach of you controls a cultist. One of the characters in the game. Your goal is to beat your enemies to get the honor of awakening Gurgamoth... whoever the hell that is.\nIt's one of those games which you start up, beat a friend a couple of times before dropping the controller and leaving satisfied.\n\nGameplay\n\nNOTE:  PLAY THIS WITH A CONTROLLER IF YOU HAVE ONE\n\nThe gameplay is very basic. Dodge, attack, anticipate when your enemy is going to attack, watch out for the map itself (sawblades, spikes etc) and try to beat your opponents. Your only weapon: the map itself.\n\nThe controls are responsive and the game is fast paced.\nThere are power-ups and every level has their own dangers to watch out for next to your opponent.\nYou have to be smart and rely on quick timing to win the battle.\n\nPROS\n\nThe visual design\nThe soundtrack\nThe unique levels which keep it refreshing with its own dangers\nColourful characters to choose from\nEasy to pick up and play when you and your friends are bored\nLocal co-op\nLove the animations\nCONS\n\nNo campaign or story behind Gurgamoth\nNo singleplayer of any kind which is a bummer, would love to know more about the colourful characters!\nOnly local so no multiplayer.\nVerdict\n\nWhen you have friends over who enjoy games, have them bring a controller to play this. It's fun, fast and it looks great. It's perfect for a fun time with your buds.\nThe visual design is great and the soundtrack fits the quick gameplay. I enjoyed smashing my mates into a sawblade and so will you. If you have controllers lying around that is. I do recommend this to any of you who are looking for a fun game to play with your friends.\nA great game. Having a laugh while playing is really what adds to the game experience.\n\nFinal verdict: 7.5/10  Great for what it is!  But in my opinion a missed  opportunity in the story behind the characters and Gurgamoth, That could make an interesting game.\n\nWant more recommendations?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/418360/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Galvanic Games is a Seattle-based full service creative studio that specializes in design, development, and services for games. The team led by C.J. Kimberlin have already developed two other games in Rust Belt and Moderne Artiste. Gurgamoth is the team’s debut title on Steam. It’s a local multiplayer fighter that has recently undergone a greatly appreciated update that has seen the introduction of bots into the game. This has given the game an enormous boost in playability because, obviously, those who wouldn’t have been able to enjoy the game previously are now in a position where they can play.\n\nBefore I begin to praise the bot game – the one mode that I’ve been able to play to this date – I want to pinpoint a negative. The game, for whatever reason, gave me the ability to control multiple players in each game. Given that the starting point for each round can position the characters at either side of the screen and there are deadly traps on the sides of the screen the game almost demands that you will kill off one of the characters before you begin. The only time that you score a point is if you win the round and only one character can win the game. Therefore I would have much preferred the standard ability of controlling just a single character and playing against three AI controlled players. I’m not sure whether this was the intention of the devs or not when they introduced this mode for single players but it was more than a little frustrating.\n\nWith that said I can see how this would be a wonderful game for those who have the ability to play the game in a multiplayer environment. The game has the potential to have a great competitive scene and local competitions would be an enormous amount of fun. Unfortunately that isn’t me at this current time but when we have my partner’s best friend’s family up during school holidays it will be a game that I load up for a bit of fun. There’s been a few games such as The Hauntsters and Dwarven Brawl Bros that we have already featured and that I will be endeavoring to play with them but I believe that Gurgamoth has the potential to be at the head of the list.\n\nWhat I enjoyed most about Gurgamoth is the presentation. I quite enjoyed the design choices in the color palette and the sound. The game controls very well and with the fast pace of the game and the traps deaths feel very fair but also exciting and challenging. It’s a very clever mix. There are a number of different effects that can kill you, the player can use the environments to their advantage and everything seems to be in keeping with the pace of the game.\n\nA minor disappointment is that the only differences in the characters that I can notice at this stage are cosmetic. It may have been nice to implement different strengths and weaknesses to the characters but I admit that given the environment of the game that may have altered the competitive balance of the game and players may have felt that they were at a distinct advantage/disadvantage if forced to choose one character over another.\n\nGurgamoth is half price for another couple of days. Therefore you will not find a better opportunity to purchase the game at a better price for some time.","May 2","true","6.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/recommended/418360/","djsoulfck","DJSF - off @ twitch.tv/sinlike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/","416 products in account","I received a copy of this game through Keymailer and was excited to try it because I enjoy combative local-multiplayer games. I was very satisfied with my gameplay experience. Be advised: this game works optimally when played with a controller.\n\nIf you enjoy arena-based local-multiplayer games, killing your friends, and fast-paced gameplay, then you will enjoy Gurgamoth.\n\nThe aesthetics are good - the amount of detail in the environment, characters, and different special effects is very high. There are a number of different characters you can play as, however, this offers only a cosmetic change. The music and sound assets are appropriate for the quick playstyle of the game.\n\nControls are very simple and easy to learn, however, I must again stress the importance of using a controller when playing; you can use the keyboard and mouse, but Gurgamoth is optimized for gamepad use. You can also play with up to three people using the keyboard and mouse, but it can be quite clutter-some to set things up this way. There is a pop up tutorial of the controls whenever you begin a match, but the different stage hazards/items (appear in the form of asteroids) are not explained anywhere, and must be learned the hard (and fun) way. The learning curve is mostly minimal, but mastering gameplay can take some time. The most challenging part of Gurgamoth will probably be perfecting your timing - a well-executed dodge+boost combo can end with your opponent's death (or yours).\n\nGameplay consists of you trying to kill your opponents by boosting into them, usually pushing them into some type of environmental hazard that varies depending on stage. For example, one stage has spikes along the edges of the map, but a covering layer must first be hit before the hazard is active (you can do this by boosting into it yourself, or by pushing an enemy). Other hazards include electricity towers that periodically turn on and laser-spitting meteors. The first player to 3 rounds won takes the cake. You begin the game with 3 boosts - there is a cooldown that will slowly recover - and the game handles balancing very well because if you are losing by a lot (ex: 0-2), it will give you 4 boosts and handicap the person winning to 2 boosts.\n\nOther asteroids will offer you temporary bonuses - like infinite boosts, a one-hit shield, slowing down time, and warping the stage perspective (ex: shrinking the map). These, along with the different hazard set up of each stage, help add a lot to the game's replayability.\n\nOverall, the game plays really well for an arena-based local multiplayer game, so long as you have enough controllers handy. If you enjoy fast-paced gameplay, then you should definitely give this title a try.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n\nMy Website[theroguereviews.com]","April 5","true","5.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
