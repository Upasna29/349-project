(You'll have a hard time running out of things to do)\n• Frequent updates\n• A lot dungeons ranging in difficulty for you and your friends (or random players) to complete.\n• Microtransactions are mainly all cosmetics (Other than mounts and crafting styles)\n\nGame Cons\n• If you have poor internet, prepare for the longest download. (80Gb)\n• You can only group up with players from the same faction. So if your friends join a different one, you're out of luck\n• Minor bugs (Rooms can take a little to fully load, possible freezing/crashing)\n• Pricing of mounts is a little high (It takes awhile for the normal player to earn even 10,000 Gold. While most horses are 42,000 gold. Other than that, there is one that is 10,000 Gold. Only other option is buying it through the micro-transaction store)\n• Only guild stores and AI markets. There is no public tradepost (like you would find in Guild Wars)\n\nControversial Features\n• Leveling system can be EXTREMLY slow, and may take a lot of time and effort to level up\n\nRelateable Games\n• Guild Wars\n• WoW\n• Skyrim\n\nConclusionElder Scrolls Online is a very fun and potentially an addicting Massive multiplayer online game. 900+ quests, giant open world map with a ton of caves, and dungeons, to explore. Sure there is some cons here and there, but overall I would reccomend this game to any person who enjoys MMOs. In the first 2-3 days of having it, I hit 30+ hours of gameplay. If you got the money and time, i'd pick this one up for sure. And no, you can not do shouts, and there is no dragons. This isn't skyrim.\n\n\n(If you found this review helpful, consider giving it a thumbs up!)\n\nLooking for more steam friends?

They knew that no one would like the paid subscription and so they finally made it free (after initial purchase).\n\nThis game is a MUST HAVE for Elder Scrolls fans, and players who want a "new" type of MMO.\n\nPROS:\n+ Good Combat System, No turn taking, and no point and spam keys.\n+ No "Grab this, kill ten of these" Quests are INTERESTING AND FUN.\n+ Lore is great, I really get immersed in this game.\n+ NOT PAY TO WIN.\n+ GOOD ECONOMY. I can buy iron ore 12g in one area and sell it to another player 15g in a different area.\nAlso no Crowns for Gold, So rich people cant mess up the economy.\n+ Decisions affect gameplay.\n+ Feels like a single player game, plays like an MMO.\n+ First person, third person, and birds eye veiw for all players and preferences.\n+ Amazing soundtrack.\n+ No paid subscription.\n+ No lowkey *BUY OUR STUFF PLZ* (ex. Guild wars 2 chest drops and keys.)\n+ Quick and fast customer support.\n+ PvP is very fun. Destroying forts with siege equipment is a blast.\n\nCons:\n- Character creator is absolute trash. needs WAY more hairstyles and body mods.\n- Must do quests to level up. Grinding takes forever.\n- Needs more classes besides 4 basic ones.\n- Needs more spells.\n- Wish it had more of a "I am me" feel.\n- Shopkeepers will give you 1 gold for items that took your FOREVER to get.\n\nThe good outweighs the bad TREMENDOUSLY. Buy this game, have fun and recommend it! Lets get this to overwhelmingly positive like it deserves.\n\n\n***EDIT***\n\nAfter playing for some time, I started to play with a friend. We started two new characters and were going to complete quests together.\n\nThe group questing needs some major improvements.\n\nSuggestions to the Developers:\n\n+Add need/greed system\n+If I complete an objective, my partner should NOT have to complete that same objective.\n+Players should have a "Waiting for buddy" before going to next area/ talking to an NPC.\n+Players should be able to teleport to buddy, their exact location if they become to far apart.\n+Players should be able to "duel" friends or other players.","March 21, 2015","true","128.4"," 6,118 of 6,721 people (91%) found this review helpful 262 people found this review funny","91","118","6","262","204"

But here is the problem, most people come into it expecting Skyrim online. DO NOT DO THIS!\n\nFirst let me get this out of the way, as this needs to be noted!\n\nIf you look at the game as an MMO first and a TES game second you will not be disappointed. Others will look at the limitations compared to Skyrim or other TES single player games. Instead i look at the freedoms! I can loot just about every container i come across, i can go into pretty much every building i come across. Other mmo's don't do this. Other mmo's don't have things scattered across their dungeons to loot aside from corpses. Someone else might say "well i can't pick up everything like i can in Skyrim" No you can't, but what mmo let's you? In this you can at least interact with objects more than other games.\n\nThe combat: You don't just stand in place watching cool downs! You have to react to your enemy, you have to block and dodge. You can't get away with auto attacking! They have improved the feel of combat, you don't feel like you are slicing thin air anymore.\n\nThe community: It's amazing! Everyone i have spoken to has been extremely friendly, eager to group up, eager to role play and get into character. No one is arguing in the chat! No one is spamming to sell you gold.\n\nThe crafting: It's just as much fun as other TES games, collecting the reagents you need isn't a chore because the world is fun to explore and gather in! There are plenty of recipes to find and experiment with.\n\nThe world: The game looks great, it's not mind blowing great, but it does look good, especially for an MMO. This isn't going to look like a graphic mod for Skyrim so forget that! But it's no slouch either. The lighting is very well done but some textures can be bland.\n\nThe customization: This is a big one! This game has a TON of customization options, dozens of skills to choose from which only get added on from joining things like the fighters and mages guild or becoming a werewolf or vampire! You can use any weapon and any armor type, there are thousands of builds for each class! The best customization i have ever seen and i've been a rabid ♥♥♥♥♥♥mer since 2003.\n\nThe crown store: It isn't pay to win! It's very similar to GW2 and there are only aesthetic options available. I was so pleased by this that i found myself WANTING to give them money in return for a cool looking mount, pet and costume. They don't pester you for money with pop ups or anything annoying like that. You buy the game and you choose to purchase aesthetics on your own terms.\n\nI haven't experienced PvP yet and i haven't got to end game, i am enjoying my time in the game as a slow burn and i recommend you do the same! DO NOT be in a rush to get to cap! Live in the world, enjoy your ascent!\n\nIn closing i will just say the game got a bad rep early on. Essentially people were paying for a beta until Tamriel Unlimited launched so i can understand their frustrations. But the game is in a MUCH better place now, i'm sure it's going to be very popular when it launches on consoles and the PC community seems to be growing now that the game is B2P!\n\nThank you for reading my review and i hope you find it helpful.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1v-ooOQ4xU&list=PLATrmgzMmuhOLFLFVtQVg65ZwIfrErIYp&index=1","May 28, 2015","true","69.0"," 2,222 of 2,419 people (92%) found this review helpful 85 people found this review funny","92","222","2","85","43"

A continent at war. The Dominion, Pact and Covenant fight for supremacy in the Imperial province of Cyrodiil. Meanwhile, Molag Bal has stolen your ♥♥♥♥ing soul.\n\nReview -11/26/15  Graphics\n\nTamriel Unlimited is pretty. It has a variety of different environments - from the sandy, sunbaked land of Elsweyr, to the frigid, unforgiving land that is Eastmarch. Whilst no, the graphics aren't particularly revolutionary, and definitely not the same quality as Skryim, this is to be expected. For an MMORPG, the Elder Scrolls Online is up there with one of the best looking. Occasionally the world looks a bit 'the same', but usually as you advance to other provinces, the environment and ambience is noticeably different.\n\nEDIT: After a discussion with someone who commented on this review (which you can read below) I'd like to add this:\nSkyrim was a very graphically capable game. The base game, on ultra, compared to ESO, on ultra, is more graphically detailed than ESO in my opinion. However, this may depend on different viewpoints and whatnot. The graphics design and feel each game wishes to portray is different, and this may lead to differences in opinion - which is to be expected.\n\n8/10\n\nPvE\n\nPlayer vs Environment is the part of this game that gets particularly monotonous. It's the easiest way to level up, as you gain a considerable amount of experience for each quest you complete, but  it does indeed become a chore. The characters are forgettable, the quests the same. Kill this, gather 'x' amount of this, talk to her/him. In my 145 hours of playtime, only a few quests have got me genuinely interested. You skip dialogue as it does not mean anything or add to the plot. It does, however, reveal some beautiful locations and there are a FEW interesting quests. For the most part, however, PvE in ESO:TU is pretty 'meh'.\n\n4.5/10\n\nPvP\n\nIf you're not sure about buying ESO for the PvE aspect, definitely consider buying it for the PvP aspect. It is likely the most fun I've ever had in an MMORPG. Nothing quite compares to standing aside a host of 50+ players as trebuchets pound castle walls, the walls crumble, and hundreds of players clash on the field of battle. If you're an Elder Scrolls fan and have always fantasized about some sort of war in Tamriel - buy this game. You're allowed to enter Tamriel at Lvl 10 (3-4 hours of playtime?). Once you enter, your stats are boosted to Veteran Rank 1(?). This means a Level 10 can still be (relatively) effective fighting higher levels, so it's pretty balanced. The PvP itself takes place in the Imperial Province of Cyrodiil, which has been invaded by three seperate factions-\n\nThe Aldmeri Dominion (High Elf, Wood Elf, Khajit)\nThe Daggerfall Covenant (Breton, Orc, Redguard)\nThe Ebonheart Pact (Argonian, Nord, Dunmer)\n(With Imperial package you can play as an Imperial in any alliance)\n\nThere are 15/16 castles around the province, 6 of which surround the Imperial City. There are also various outposts. Around the castles are resources, which, if captured, give benefits to the faction who owns them.\nThe PvP is what makes this game, and what convinced me to stay for 100+ hours.\n\n9.5/10\n\nUI/Levelling\n\nThe UI is well-designed, not too obtrusive. Levelling up is also pretty simple - each time you level up, you get to choose which stat to invest in - stamina, health or magicka.You can then choose a skill which you can plonk in your hotbar and use. Nothing broken or overpowered, though it does take testing to find the most effective skill sets.\n\n8.5/10\n\nCrafting\n\nI'm not going to lie, I've not experimented in crafting at all, so this section is from friends' experiences.\nIt's good. Dying your items can make your armor very unique, the materials are varied and it does take up time. It's not simple. Which is good.\n\n8/10\n\nFramerate\n\nI play this game on a GTX 770 and i7 4770. In the midst of a battle, with dozens of spells and effects going on as well as 100+ players on screen performing their own actions, it did not drop below 50fps. Well optimized, large scale PvP is the only time I've ever dropped below 60fps.\n\n9/10\n\nGrouping\n\nThe group questing/dungeons in this game are good, again, but not particularly revolutionary or exciting. Standard group quests and dungeon, pretty simple. Not a huge variety right now, I think there are about 7/8 without the Orsinium/Imperial City DLC. I've had loads of fun playing dungeons with friends, but it does become a bit stagnant once you've repeated them several times.\n\n7/10\n\nConclusion\n\nThis game is good. The PvP is excellent, and while the PvE isn't particularly impressive, it still functions. Bugs have almost all been ironed out. Worth your money if you enjoy the Elder Scrolls universe, and are willing to accept certain sacrifices made by Zenimax to make the game a better MMO.\n\nOVERALL: 8.5/10\nNew Witcher 3 review: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079374616/recommended/292030/\n-my first proper review, feel free to comment constructive criticism/positive feedback-","November 26, 2015","true","149.0"," 930 of 992 people (94%) found this review helpful 46 people found this review funny","94","930","992","46","47"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wowafreebeer/recommended/306130/","wowafreebeer","WowAFreeBeer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wowafreebeer/","68 products in account","At the time of writing this I am roughly around 180 hours in the game.\n\nWhen I first got into Elder Scrolls it was with Skyrim. Playing only that and none of the other previous games I was blown away with how detailed that game was. When I heard that a MMORPG was made with the same title I was very enthusastic. When I got Elder Scrolls Online, I was told it would not be "Skyrim Online", and to an extent, those whom mentioned it were correct. However my thoughts and feelings on that statement have changed quite a bit.\n\nAfter playing for as long as I have, which in comparison to many others, I have found this to be right at home with my previous experience with Skyrim. I absolutley love this game. I feel that it is totally worth the $60 price tag and I invite other open minded players to give this game a shot. There are many differences from the Single Player version of Elder Scrolls but all of the reasons I loved Skyrim are placed in this game.\n\nThe ability to customize my character in any way I see fit, the endless caves, areas and places of interest to see. Fully voiced NPC's and endless hours of lore and other content for players to experience. Not to mention that NPC's reconize your heroic feats as you walk by them, often singing your praises and sometimes even questioning some of your actions that you have made in the game. In fact, there are many circumstances where I have had to make a tough decision and have spent much time dwelling after the fact if I made the right call. Should I have helped fight at the docks or was defending the fort the better call? The result might be the same but the fact that I even had to contemplate the lives of fictional NPC's that I would never meet again shows how enriching the plot can be.\n\nThe  PvP in my opinion is very hard, but very fun. I die often, but its not frustrating. Being able to team togeather with random strangers, plan an attack and take a fort seems like it would be difficult to do but everyone is on board and ready to play the game. They want to succeed as much as you and I found the community helpful and enriching, not to mention being able to use seige weapons is so much fun and adds a level of excitment I didn't realize was part of the game.\n\nIn the non PvP side, I found most players to be felpful, friendly and very outgoing. I found a guild almost right away and in that guild was open minded Veteren players who wanted to help grow and encourage newer players. Often investing a lot of time and energy explaining various parts of the game such as Armor, Weapons, Skill's, ect. Even non guild members and complete strangers are often pretty nice. I can recall looking for a Werewolf Bite and after a few bad players asking me for a ton of gold and crafting materials in order to give me a bite, one player simple messaged me and say "don't pay them anything, I will give it to you for free." Not only that but he also gave me tips on how to complete the Werewolf single player quest.\n\nI plan on sticking with this MMORPG for a very long time. Its fun, its first person, its 3rd person and its live action. It has its faults, all games do, but if you can take things with an open mind and a grain of salt you will find much love for this awesome game. It wont ever be "Skyrim Online" but in many ways I really feel it is. A great story, great community of players, a big wide open world to explore with choices that are unique to your character. Seems pretty close in my opinion.\n\n","July 5, 2015","true","414.7"," 381 of 415 people (92%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","92","381","415","23","0"

While the game does have the lore and basic 'dumbed down' aesthetic of The Elder Scrolls it lacks the atmosphere. What I mean is it does not draw you into the lore and entice you as does it's single player cousins. Rather, you find yourself mindlessly fighting through zone to zone, quest to quest, dungeon to dungeon with no genuine interest in its lore or atmosphere. This is a hugely common trait to an MMO and not something the Elder Scrolls is known for bringing.\n\nThat being said it's by no means a bad game or MMO. In fact, it's outstanding. The combat loosely resembles The Elder Scrolls and has a fairly decent spectrum of play styles between the classes. PVP in ESO is a breath of fresh air but can soon become stale and has a hugely disadvantages experience curve in the start.\n\nTo summarize, you'll find yourself trying to delve in and love this game as you would the world of The Elder Scrolls. However, you should not add this to your library simple because it wears The Elders Scrolls 'cloak' as you may be disappointed. As an MMO, it's fantastic and fairly unboring but does leave much to be desired despite its large amount of content.\n\nIf you are looking for a good MMO that wears The Elder Scrolls aesthetic and features a few new treats to the MMO scene then this may be the game for you.

But ever since tamriel unlimited came out, and future patches/updates it's a fantastic game.\n\nI want to make something clear. If someone said that i had to destroy a copy of either skyrim or eso, and never buy the same game again, i would obviously keep skyrim and destroy eso. However that doesn't mean eso is a bad game. Far from it. It's fantastic.\n\nA lot of the hate comes from the fact that this game is an MMO. And then you'll see people ♥♥♥♥♥ing and complaining about it. But that fact is, what were you expecting? If you wish to buy this because you think it'll be skyrim online then don't. If you like MMO's and the Elder Scrolls then this is a must buy. Heck if you like the elder scrolls or MMO's then still get it!\n\nI'm going to admit that this isn't the direction i would want the elder scrolls series to go down, but it is a nice change. And that is something we, as a community, need to accept. Things won't always be the same.\n\nIf you haven't played ESO since launch, then i beg you to give it another try.\n\nWith no Monthly subscription to worry about, i can play at ease. Now to the pro's and cons since i feel like doing them just this once.\n\nPROS:\n\n*Nice Graphics : Hear my out for a second. Yes the individual textures aren't that brilliant, but when you put them all together it's really nice.\n\n*Awesome Gameplay : In skyrim, morrowind or oblivion you mainly just swing your sword (however that is quite entertaining). With ESO the gameplay feels much more exciting and involved. You feel like a badass with your skills, and it's really satisfying when you kill an ememy with a skill like Mages Fury. If you only care about gameplay then look no further. (More details on gameplay below).\n\n*Skills : The selling point for this game is the skills. I haven't seen it in any game before, and it's a really nice feature. You can spend your skill points (gained each level, or by finding skyshards around the map), on many different skill tree's. What you can spend your skill points on doesn't really depend on your class. Let me explain.\n\nYou have a load of different skill trees depending on, your class, what armor you wear, what weapon you use, if your a vampire or werewolf, what guild you are in, what race you are, and a few more.\n\nThese skill trees level up on their own, and once they reach a high enough level you can get more skills in that tree. Then you can level THAT skill. Once you have leveled a skill up enough, you can morph it. Giving it different effects!\n\nIt almost always has the same base effect but with different buffs! For example...\n\nMages fury does x shock damage. If your target falls below 20% health in 4 seconds, an explosion deals an additional x damage.\n\nIt's great for a finisher, however the morph adds even more to that skill!\n\nEndless fury restores magicka if it was the killing blow. And Mages wrath deals more explosion damage.\n\nSee where i'm getting at?\n\nGame Size : I was surprised at how big this game was! Sure you can't explore EVERY inch of tamriel but you can explore a hell of a lot! The world is massive and imo the world is quite detailed.\n\n*The world feels alive. For example if you save a town in one area, they will interact with you, and will always act differently. So they could be in a barn because their town is burning, and then be back in the villiage rebuilding.\n\n*Sheogorath : Nuff said.\n\nI may have missed out some stuff...\n\nCONS\n\nLag : Isn't really a problem for me, however if you have a poor internet then it's going to be very laggy for you.\n\nLeveling up : Isn't really that much of a problem however i feel as though leveling in this game takes a bit to long. It isn't paced that well either.\n\nSOME quests : SOME, and i will say SOME quests are a bit boring and dull. But again, SOME. As long as Razum Dar is in the quest it's perfect. But SOME are a bit boring and not very creative\n\nSOME voice acting : A bit or a lot of the voice acting is a bit poor. But it is an MMO and it's better then nothing.\n\nNot much direction : This might just be something i have a problem with. When i first got into the game i had no idea of where to go, and what to do. I ended up dying a lot.\n\nBugs : There are quite a few bugs... This is an elder scrolls game afterall. Not all that major though.\n\n\n----\n\nYou may think that i'm being a fanboy because i don't make a big deal about the cons. But i don't honestly care. This is a solid game. It's well made. However, i hope the next elder scrolls game won't just be a massive expansion to this.\n\nFinal Rating : 8/10\n\n\nFirst serious review. Sorry if it's bad.\n\n\n","November 28, 2015","true","179.4"," 321 of 360 people (89%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","89","321","360","16","5"

Economy system\nnow, this part that i really like, there is no public auction whatsoever, you can trade/get some kind of auction, but only through a guild, thus in this game you could join up to 5 guilds\n\nwith this system, you can cross trading between guilds, looking for best price to buy and sell on each region, really reminds me of XIAN online type of economy, dynamic controlled by player\n\nnow, let switch to the negative side of the game :\n\n1. the soundtrack\nIMHO, theres no single memorable soundtrack in this game, in FF14 i always remember which soundtrack belong to which area, but here....every music feels the same, theres like no identity at all for each music.\n\n2. the character creation\nthe character creation too shallow imho, theres no clear different between each slide bar for every part of the character body, thus i can't made the character i really want even though i waste 30-50 minutes creating it\n\n\ntl;dr -> The Elder Scrolls Online : It sucks no more, highly reccomended for everyone :)","May 13, 2015","true","991.4"," 537 of 634 people (85%) found this review helpful 50 people found this review funny","85","537","634","50","29"

I'd suggest this game to almost anyone and I know I have a lot more to play and do.\n\nFor now my review is going to focus on the 'mixed' user review. If you spend the time to review the negative reviews you'll find a common theme. 'Boring' and 'massive download'.\n\nThe download file is indeed massive, it's a large game. The updates are big, the game is big, even patches seem to be fairly large. So come into the game with the expectation you're going to spend a bit downloading before you can play. This should rule out about 50% of the negative reviews.\n\nThe other 30% of negative reviews come from a general theme of 'boring mmo'. As we all know, or at least should know, a lot of time and effort goes into the ambience of the Elder Scroll games. The small side stories, the heart, the emotion around the play. The entire game is like a massive novel, there is some reading to be done and a lot of voices to listen to. I would strongly suggest that for those of us who want to get involved with a great story and fantastic lore, play this game.\n\nIf you're looking to rush and skip all dialog and just run between point to point to grind missions of course it's going to be boring. You're purposely skipping the content just to level up. Don't do that, then say the game was boring because you purposely made it boring.\n\nThe reviews for graphics, gameplay, physics, etc are all great. The game feels like Skyrim and the other ES games and in my opinion does a great job of bringing it online.\n\nIn short don't let the 'mixed' reviews fool you. The true reviews are the positive ones. Most negative reviews focus only on the file size and how grinding is boring. Don't let those fool you.","March 17, 2015","true","35.5"," 1,407 of 1,824 people (77%) found this review helpful 64 people found this review funny","77","407","1","64","34"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/306130/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","The Elder Scrolls Online is part of the ever popular Elder Scrolls franchise; this is the first multiplayer instalment however. The game was released on PC in April 2014. The game got rid of the subscription to play in March of 2015; however a full purchase of the game is still required for account activation.\n\nThe game is set in Tamriel, much like the other games, but you are able to traverse many more different locations compared to the previous game's one location model. The game play in this game is quite similar to the other games in the series, in that you can play in either first person or third person camera, and everything is largely nonlinear. The game throws in a good mixture of quests, events and of course, exploration.  You are able to play as a number of difference racers, some of which I have not seen before in the Elder Scrolls series, so it’s nice to see more variety here. Along with four different classes to select, Templar, Dragonknight, Sourcer, and Nightblade.  The combat in TESO is similar to that of World of Warcraft, you have a set number of action bars available, and you mash the button you want to use, there is of course an optimum rotation your character should be using rather than just rolling your face across the keyboard though. I much preferred this combat system to what of Oblivion even though it may come across as simplified.\n\nWhilst the game is an MMO, I have to say I only really played it as a single player experience. You will occasionally run into the odd other real player when you are out in the world, but there is no real need to interact with them. Each time you level up in game, you are given points to spend in three main stats, health, magicka and stamina – along with a skill point. These skill points can be spent on new abilities for your class, a different weapon set, your race and even any guilds that you are a part of. This allows you to mould your character to exactly how you want it to be. I went with a rogue type character that snuck in and killed enemies before they had a chance to realise I was even in the room, but there are plenty of other play styles.\n\nSince this is an online game, the graphics are going to be a little watered down, but the game still looks really good, comparing it to an unmodded Skyrim, it is actually on par with its style if you ask me. I was playing with everything maxed out and on 4k resolution, but even so, it looked gorgeous. Some of the environments you are in look so flush and vibrant with wild life. If you are playing on a less powerful computer though, you will find a huge amount of graphical options that will allow you to lower the settings to get the game to run – this does make the game look very poor though, it isn’t a very well optimized game sadly.\n\nThe story in Elder Scrolls Online is something which really hooked me straight away. I learnt more about the lore of Elder Scrolls in this game than all of the others combined. The plot is indirectly linked to the other games, and takes place a thousand years before the events of Skyrim, and 800 years before Morrowind and Oblivion.  There is a huge amount of lore to be found in the game, whether it be a quest, or a book, or a random event, there is plenty to learn about if you are interested in the lore of Elder Scrolls.\n\nThis game has some fantastic voice acting in. Every single NPC that you need to talk to for a quest is fully voice acted and is done to an extremely high quality level. I was expecting having to read a lot from my past experience with ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes, but I was pleasantly surprised that I could sit back and enjoy the dialog between the NPCs. This may have been why I took so much more information in than previous games in the series.\n\nThe locations and zones that you will find in Elder Scrolls Online are ginormous. One of the very first zones you visit is one of the biggest I have seen in a game. It takes you a good 15 minutes of just walking to go from one side to the other. A lot of it does tend to be emptiness with the odd random enemy sadly though. The towns seem to be a hive of activity from either other players or NPCs so it gives you a sense of not being alone in the huge world.  There is one main quest which you will follow throughout the course of the game, but in good RPG style, the meat and bones comes from the side quests. Each line of quests has its own backstory, a problem you have to solve, and then a resolution which will sometimes result in you having to make a decision and then you will be given a reward, and in most cases this will be equipment. Whilst most of the quests in the game can be considered repetitive, I didn’t really feel as if I was completing the same one over and over again – because I was so immersed in the story, I wasn’t just going to kill X amount of bandits, I was aiding the nearby village from future attacks, so on and so on.  Some of the quests can be hard to locate the quest giver, but as you get close to an NPC that will offer you a quest, you will get a marker on your map.\n\nI have been playing The Elder Scrolls Online for almost twenty hours, and I am only level 15 with my character. The max level for any character is 50, meaning there is a boat load of content in this game and I am by no means getting bored at all. I can see there being a large amount of replay ability too. Creating a different character with a different play style will no doubt give you another 200 hours of content after you finish your first. You also have the end game content as well, such as veteran dungeons, crafting, and of course, PVP.\n\nTechnically, The Elder Scrolls Online is technically sound. I had no issues with bugs, crashing or glitches. Everything is working as intended with no problems. Obviously you are going to need a stable internet connection to be able to play properly; but with the large amount of settings to configure, you should be able to get the game to run on almost anything. I would like to have seen a field of view option, but maybe I am asking too much there. The game also has capabilities of using add-ons, I didn’t find a need to use any, but should you require some, you can use the Curse client to manage and install them all for you without any issues.\n\nIn summary, if you play this game as a single player experience, or maybe even hook up with a friend to play through, you will get a huge amount of enjoyment out of it. If you go in expecting it to be a bustling MMORPG game, you will be servery disappointed.  I am having an awesome time playing and I am thoroughly enjoying every moment of my experience in The Elder Scrolls Online.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Do you wish it was multiplayer? Then don't get this game because it isn't Skyrim with multiplayer. It is an MMO plain and simple, with an Elder Scrolls skin on it. It's fun, don't get me wrong, and some of the lore is... relatively interesting if you like that sort of thing. But many people come to it thinking it'll be different than the reality. All in all it's pretty fun, not enough to hold my interest for too terribly long even with playing with 2 friends, but interesting nonetheless. You can spend hundreds of hours and get enjoyment, or a couple dozen and feel done with it. It is by no means fantastic and I'm sure there are free to play MMO's that are better, but it's passable especially since it's no longer subscription based. If it was free as well, it would be perfectly fine by me, and probably be scored way higher in general but sadly Bethesda doesn't seem keen on the idea of making it completely free. But who knows.

Most of these bad reviews on steam seem to be from people expecting to be Skyrim over the internet. Yes, the lore is the same and it takes place im Tamriel but its unfair to compare a MMORPG to a standalone game.\n\nElder Scrolls Online is a breath of fresh air in the MMO scene, it breaks the convencional class stereotypes of most MMOs. Yes, there is 4 classes to choose from but those are just templates, any class can use any weapon or be a tank, a healer, a dps or whatever kind of class you can think of (with certain limitations). You level up the weapon/armour/skill ability by using it but you are not restricted. Dont like that massive 2 handed axe you started with? Change to a destruction staff. You like the axe after all? No problem, go back to using it.\n\nStorylines are really well done, main quest is amazingly good and the side quests can be more interesting than the main plot at times, im one of those persons who has little patience to follow all the plots and i find myself actually listening (yes, npcs are voice acted) to the story plots. Quests are the usual for a MMO, yet theres very few quests that tell you "Kill 10 of these, collect 5 of those", altough you end up doing that anyway in most cases, it is not the quest objective itself, so you dont feel like youre "grinding".\n\nOne little detail i like about ESO is that other people cant "steal" your quest objectives most of the time everyone sees their own stuff, with some exceptions. For exploration addicts like myself, ESO maintains what Skyrim did, hidden quests, lore objects, hidden books and skyshards to look for.\n\nGroup content is fairly good, ranging from world bosses, dolmens and the usual dungeons. Veteran dungeons can be really challenging and require team work and actual tactics contrary to some other MMOs. Its a shame they didnt made a better use of group tool as from my experience seems most people are either not aware it exists or simply dont use it.\n\nSo yes, its not Skyrim Online and it will never be, if you decide to play ESO thinking it is ,then you better save your money but if you look at it as a MMORPG and, like me, played and got bored of the usual standard type MMOs, then you might be pleasantly surprised.\n\nUPDATE: Not only ESO is subscription free since the 17th March it also has two new systems, Justice and Champion System. Justice its the start of which i hope will be the coming of Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood, cause it allows players to steal, pickpocket and murder NPCs, still needs some minor improvements but it can be really fun.\n\nAs for Champion system its a whole new sets of passive skills basically increasing even more the possibilities on creating all different kinds of builds/classes, altough i hope they remove some useless passives and replace others in the future and for someone that completed all the quests only way to win Champions points,for now, its just brainless grinding of mobs,group content and not much else.\n\nFinally the new Crown store that came with the drop of subscriptions sells pets, mounts, cosmetics and consumables, so far nothing that allows players to have advantage over others.","November 11, 2014","true","752.4"," 1,518 of 1,999 people (76%) found this review helpful 57 people found this review funny","76","518","1","57","44"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ironmanmk7/recommended/306130/","Ironmanmk7","IronmanMK7","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ironmanmk7/","101 products in account","(FOREWARD)\nNow that i've reached the endgame and spent quite sometime with this game i wanted to leave a review. Most reviews that i've read are from people who either didn't even hit level ten or spent 40 hours thinking they could speed level through the game and found it impossible. Also to really understand this game you have to completely cut it away from the main series games. THIS IS NOT AN ELDER SCROLLS GAME. It is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥me with an elder scrolls theme and overtone. Also in the time since launch this game has drastically evolved. a substantial patch is added nearly every month with new content, systems, and fixes.\n\n(REVIEW)\n\nGraphics- I'll start with the obvious. The graphics in ESO are gorgeous. You can really see the hard work that went into making tamriel a truly breathtaking world. From The snow in Eastmarch and The Swamps in Shadowfen to the A'likr Desert each environment was crafted in a way that makes you want to see whats next for your journey.\n\nGame World- While on the subject of the Environments the scope of Tamriel is insane. It is easily one of the largest Game world i have ever seen. Also the difference between zones is quite drastic. Sure you might see similer buildings in the same zone but that is to be expected in a game of this size.\n\nCharacter Creation/Development- The Character creation in ESO is probably the most robust and fluid system i've seen in an mmo to date. You have 3 alliances each with 3 races (And imperial as the tenth for an upgrade fee) and the choice between 4 classes. The thing that sets ESO apart is the fact that these classes are not constarined whatsoever. You Want a Sorcerer with medium armor that wields two swords? go for it. Every class can use any type of armor or weapon the want with out specializing in any. The only constriction your class sets on use is the specific skill line you will use.\n\nSkills- Logically the next step is skills. In the game you don't have a typical mmo skill tree. There are an assortment of skill lines  including class, weapon, armor, racial, world, guild, and crafting skills. You literally have hundreds of options for where to invest your skills. some being active hot key skills for combat and others being passives to buff your stats. This system gives you more freedom then any previous mmo i've played.\n\nCrafting- As an avid crafter i absolutely love the crafting system. A player is'nt confined to any one profession. I can use my blacksmithing skill to craft my weapons and armor, my woodworking skill to craft my shields, and my enchanting skill to craft runes to enchant my weapons and armor. Also the system is quite robust. You earn experience in your crafting skills by crafting(obviously), Deconstructing(which gives you materials as well), Improving items, and researching(which gives you traits). On weapons and armor you can research about 20 different traits which you can then use in your crafting recipes to recieves buff from increasing attack and defense to adding critical chance or increasing skill line experience.\n\nQuesting- Questing is one thing most people are uninformed about. Some reviews make it out to be bland basic quests. In fact it is the opposite. Gone are the collect 10 of this for no reason and kill 20 of these because i'm bored quests. Sure some quests have those aspects but every quest has a story. You might be setting up a ritual to stop a nechromancer or finding out who killed a local merchant or helping soldiers take control of a fort. every quest has some reasoning that makes it interesting and makes you want to know what happens. also many quests can completely change whats happening in an area.\n\nEconomy- This is one point that has really annoyed me. Many people are calling for a public auction house but the fact of the matter is that in a game like this Thats impossible. Eso is not based on servers. There are 2 Mega servers. With the immense population of a mega server an auction house would become bogged down with high level items which would lower the value and in turn ruin the reward of earning top tier gear. The way it is set up with guild stores makes it much more accessable. Also with the last update guild merchants have been added so that you can buy items from other guilds members. most large cities have a handful of guild merchants that will have completely different wares to choose from which helps keep the value of items.\n\nPvp- I am not much of a pvp player so i don't have much sway on it. but from what other players have told me it is better at higher levels and always more fun in a group.\n\nEndgame- Now that i have Passed the level cap of 50 and entered the veteran rank system it really adds a lot to the game. After beating your factions story and the main story you are able to play through every quest from the other factions scaled up to your level. The content gets much harder but also much more rewarding. I am Only veteran Rank 1 out of 14 after update 4 released today But i will Update as i move forward.\n\nSo all in all The Elder Scrolls Online has been a wonderful Journey for me. If you go into it expecting to play skyrim you probably will not enjoy it but if you go into it looking at it as an MMO its a very rewarding experience. PLAY THIS GAME!\n\nSCORE- 8/10\n\n(p.s. I've played this game for almost 140 hours as of this review. if your going to take anyones word for how the games is don't listen to the guy with under 10 hours. It took me 120 hours to hit level 50. I might be subjective in my review but at least let my experience speak for me and anyone else with substantial time in the game. It gets better every update!)\n\n(EDIT)- Seeing as no one is really understanding my meaning i thought i would add to this. When i say its not an elder scrolls game i mean that as in it is completely different then the main series games. It is a new take on the series but it still has all of the original areas, lore, creatures, etc... Giving a game that gave fair warning that it would be completely differentt a bad rap for only the fact that its different isn't right. If its too risque for you because your an elder scrolls fanboy that thinks this game tarnishes their reputation then the easy thing to do is just not play it. Don't tell everyone else that they are wrong in playing it when you won't step out of your comfort zone and try something new. Now enough ranting. PLAY IT. HAVE FUN.","September 16, 2014","true","344.9"," 1,483 of 1,976 people (75%) found this review helpful 89 people found this review funny","75","483","1","89","63"

The game constsntly makes me smile and I play it almost every day. This game has done a lot of things right and has even done a lot of things better than Skyrim. Here are the pros and cons of the game,\n\n--PROS\n-Massive game world full of adventure and culture\n-Meaningful and mostly exciting quests\n-Hundreds of memorable characters\n-Simple yet powerful character creation\n-Detailed crafting systems involivng styles, levelled crafting, traits, etc . . .\n-Engaging combat consisting of a combination of skyrim's "Hack n' Slash" combat, WoW's hotbar ability styled combat, and a little bit of rolling to dodge attacks\n-Massive player made guilds with banks, guild merchants, and more\n-Player based economy for trading and guild merchants\n-Intelligent AI that can detect when they are outnumbered, cooperate with other NPCs, etc . . .\n-Skyrim style skill-based levelling\n-Armor dyes that can be gained as rewards for completing achievements\n-Intricate PvP based in Cyrodil with forts, seige weapons, missions, etc . . .\n-Players can become the Emperor based on the war in Cyrodil\n-Free-form classes that can use any kind of weapon or armor (For example, a sorcerer using a battleaxe)\n-Hundreds of lore books scattered throughout the world to be added to your "Lore Library"\n-Great dungeons filled with powerful enemies and unique loot\n-Many teamwork based possabilities in the form of "synergies"\n-Great voice acting\n-Player emotes and animations\n-Mounts and pets\n-Dynamic weather and time cycle\n-Decent graphics\n-Polished UI and menus\n-Hours upon hours of content including lots of late-game content\n-Incredible framerate (compared to Skyrim)\n-World events like "Daedric Anchors"\n-One of the best final boss battles in modern video games\n-A "phasing"  system that changes certain areas of the world for certain players after they do certain quests in those areas to provide the feeling that you are actually making a difference\n-Epic backround music along with bards that play their own songs\n-Continous flow of new content and patches\n-"Crown Store" filled with asthetic and conveniance items (Nothing overpowered)\n\n--CONS\n-Slightly buggy (mostly hilarious visual bugs)\n-Short "MMO Style" agro ranges for enemies (Kinda needed in most areas)\n-Very few mounts and pets you can get normally in game\n-You have to do a lot of side quest to keep up with the main quest's progressive levelling\n-No way to easily communicate during combat\n-Player-made guilds are account-based, not character-based\n-People can easily (and accidentally) steal your kills, and in doing so, steal your loot and experience\n-People aren't honorable in PvP, causing the fun and challenging character builds to be useless, stupid, and suicidal in PvP. Prepare for a painful amount of ganking in Cyrodil.\n-Lack of sweetrolls (Couldn't think of anything else)\n\n--Things that I would like to see (MY OPINION)\n-1v1 dueling between members of the same faction\n-Player housing where players can either purchase upgrades or build it themselves (possibly using racial styles?)\n-The ability to lock your guild to certain factions (For example, a guild is locked to the Ebonheart Pact, so a charcter in the Aldmeri Dominion doesn't have access to that guild)\n-More mounts and pets that can be aquired normally through questing\n-The function to go through a certain instance ALONE\n-Some sort of "Voice to Text" system\n-More sweetrolls (MORE OF THEM)\n\nThis game is great, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.

The game is great I would recommend ESO to any MMO fan.\n\nEdit:\n\nAlthough I still love the MMO, the more hours I put in the more furstrated I got. leveling takes FOREVER and becomes mundane and boring once you hit vet ranks (lvl 1-49, than vet ranks 1- 16). So any end game dungeons or PvP you wanted to do is going to take you 100's of hours to get to per toon. This is a huge problem for me and I imagine many opthers who have limited time to play games. Between college and work I just can't justify putting all my time into ESO if I am making no progress.\n\nThe combat is still amazing and the questing is identical to skyrim, and Zenimax is constanly listening to the community and improving the game.\n\nIf you have the time ESO is the best MMO you can choose to play and I highly reccomend it, but if you are limited in the time you can play games i'd choose a diffrent MMO (and maybe not an MMO at all as MMO's tend to be major time investments)\n\nEdit 2:\n\nI recently got back into the game as I heard that with the next expansion the Vet rank dilemma I had before is going to be removed. As of this edit  Vet ranks are still in the game, but i thought I would start leveling a character and get a bit ahead  of the curve before they were removed. Anyway the game has continued to improve and the population is growing. I have fallen in love with ESO all over again. Also if you are still unsure about ESO and want to watch a review, I suggest MMOGrinder's review over AngryJoe's. It is more recent, more in-depth, and an overall better review than Joe's is.","June 28, 2015","true","167.6"," 92 of 112 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","92","112","7","2"

I highly recommend buying the game directly from The ESO website, and NOT on Steam. Cut out this awful middle man, save yourself some grief. Zenimax Online's customer service got back to me within 2 hours of filing a ticket. Steam never got back to my ticket at all.\n\nAs for the game itself? Two thumbs way up.

Suffice to say, this is the best MMO I've played in years.\n\nThe questing is fully voiced, and the quests are actually fun and interesting, with lots of lore built in. I have to say, it actually really does remind me of playing through an actual Elder Scrolls game! If you take your time to actually enjoy it like you would, say, Skyrim, then you will definitely get that Elder Scrolls experience. It won't be the same, of course, as it's a distilled version mixed with cleverly implemented MMO elements, but it's a great experience nonetheless. I appreciate the developers' efforts to make the levelling fun, and their great execution of the flexibility in skills and builds (two-handler wielding heavy armour battlemage? Yep, it's viable!)\n\nI highly recommend buying the game, and giving it a chance.

People who complained about this should be castrated, seriously, play the d*mn game.\n\nStop complaining and stop being a lazybump by doing quest/delves/dungeons.\n\nThe reason the mobs drop very little gold is to discourage grinding and gold farmers, because there are so many ways of earning gold other than mindless grind!\n\nYou can be rich in gold for just playing the game!\n\nYou can kill enemies and sell the loot they give you, craft items and sell them to merchant,do a lot of quests and earn a F*UCKTON  of gold.\n\nESO has fixed most of its issues  since launch and beta version and is continuing to fix the remaining ones and adding the most anticipated one as well:\n\nJustice system where you can lollygagging around and steal from NPCs,kill NPCs and go to prison, etc. Champion System ,Thieves guild and dark brotherhood is going to be added soon! The hype is real!!\n\nI am looking forward to the awesome PVP war world contents soon and from watching the PVP gameplay, it certainly doesnt look disappointing! When I saw it, my jaw drops instantly, can't wait to touch the PVP aspect of this game! I will continue to update this review as I go along the game!\n\nTo the people who is complaining and warned people ahead like"do not go into PVP and play this game ,if not , get ready to be r*ped by peoples 20 levels higher than you." Well what do you expect?! It's an MMO and progress and skill leveled based!\n\nI am new to MMO world and what I heard from a regular MMO player, nowadays ,your typical ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes have a ♥♥♥♥♥tty graphic, 4v4 or 5v5 PVP, hotbar-based combat,static world and no exploration , NO voice acting etc\n\nI am really satisfied with the game developers decision of making the game B2P. The shop is not P2W, it only sells convenience items and cosmetics.\n\nA lot of people I know are suckers for costumes and mounts, believe it or not. I'm looking at you, Victor!!\n\nThe Imperial edition of this game is not locking content out!\n\nYou don't miss out on quests, dungeons or any other content.\n\nIn a way, going B2P provides a paywall to lock out those bots , gold farmers and trolls trash.\n\nNow moving on the thing that I would like them to improve on:\n\nIn this game, all the mobs are stationed in one spot.  If you tried to kite , they will only chase you so far before they go back to their spot with FULL HEALTH and forget you even attacked them. This is b*ll F*cking sh*t and I almost lost my sh*t when this happened couple of times.\n\nGrouping are major issues that needs to be addressed  as you can't join your friends in quest if you have already done the quest, the infamous "invisible person bug" where one person in your group is invisible and you just see the chevron over their head.\n\nHaving said that, I am pretty optimistic that they will laid out a lot of improvements over the next few months.\n\nNo matter what you haters do, you can't stop ESO from becoming a success.\n\nUntil next time! Post will be updated once I venture more and stop my lollygagging!!","February 3, 2015","true","404.3"," 370 of 548 people (68%) found this review helpful 49 people found this review funny","68","370","548","49","13"

I remember as a kid begging my parents to buy it for me once it was announced for Xbox. The world, the characters, and the stories that you could create were some of my most cherished gaming moments. I've continued to play each Elder Scrolls game thats been released since and probably know more about the lore of these games then I do actual world history. Now that I've had the chance to put a significant amount of time into ESO, I think I can fairly review it.\n\nFirst of all, let me address the monthly fee. I think that it is beyond unfair to ask $15 a month plus the full retail price of the game. With the base price included, the game adds up to be about $250 for your first year. That is unacceptable for any game, regardless of the quality. There aren't any pay to win features of the game, but they still need to come up with a better model then this if they want people other then the most die-hard Elder Scrolls fans to play their MMO.\n\nLet me just  quick fire the rest of my negative opinions before moving on to the many positives of the game. It's hard to group quest when your friends disappear because they are at a different part of the quest then you. The horses in the game are overpriced beyond belief. I played for almost 100 hours with one character and still couldn't afford a damn horse. Not cool...not cool. Also, some of the zones in the game look very similar to other zones when they should not according to the lore. That one is a nerdy complaint, but it still sort of irked me.\n\nNow for the positives. The game looks very pretty for an MMO. I liked most of the art style and had some moments when I was just running around where I had to just stop and enjoy the scenery. The one exception to this is Cyrodil (where all the pvp takes place). While I didn't spend much time there, it was huge space that was populated with almost nothing interesting to see. Other than that, the dungeons and the effects in the game are great.\n\nThe fact that everything is voice acted is another amazing feat in an MMO. I know that Bioware already did this with The Old Republic, but here it is done really well. It makes the quests feel like  single player quests and makes the game a bit more immersive. Along with this, the quests are pretty good for an MMO. Compared to other games in the genre, ESO has great variety and made me wonder what cool thing I might stumble upon next.\n\nThe community was also pretty good for ESO (at least when I played over the summer). I ran into alot of cool people and most were willing to help out or just have dance-offs at least. This may be related to the fact that the game is subsription based, but I'd be willing to endure a few ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s if it meant not taking out a small loan to access the game.\n\nI think the game itself deserves to be played. The developers crafted a fun and beautiful game. I am conflicted though. Im not sure whether to recommend it or not. If you want to play something a little different than your standard MMO, give ESO a shot. However, be prepared to spend a lot of money on the game.","October 16, 2014","true","293.2"," 674 of 1,024 people (66%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","66","674","1","36","26"

First of all, I am not comparing this to previous Elder Scrolls games. I am viewing it as it should be viewed, as an MMO.\n\nFirst off, combat: The combat so far has proven to be very demanding of attention. It's also very fluid and is diverse as well.\n\nSecond, crafting: As far as crafting goes, I have no complaints. It's not too difficult to a frustrating point but it's not easy enough for a beginner to get going right off the bat. Your crafting levels don't take forever to level up either like other MMOs and don't require extreme amounts of materials. It's fair.\n\nThird, quests: Questing in this game is generally the same as most MMOs, but feels very different. Everything is voice acted and the quests are fairly easy to follow along. They actually provide a story to the quest and make it feel meaningful, like what you're doing will actually mean something and isn't just a means for you to level up.\n\nFourth, customization: Cosmetic wise, the game is great. You can get disguises through quests and use those as costumes if you wish. You can also unlock dye colors for your armor and dye them whenever you want for no charge. (But they get bound to your character)\n\nFifth and final, skills & leveling: The skills are similar to previous Elder Scrolls games, where the more you use something the more you level it up and unlock more for that skill. Leveling up your main level takes a bit of time, but it's not too difficult.\n\nHow would I rate this game? If I had to be honest, I'd give it a clear 9.5/10. With this much exploration, heart pounding fights, and deep questing all in one game and with the removal of the monthly subscription, I would say this game is a must buy for MMO lovers. Even if you're not a fan of Elder Scrolls, if you like MMOs I would deffinetly give this game a chance.\n\n[Edit]\nAbout 150 hours in and I finally see some issues with this game, although very minor. The most annoying being that with the class system, ALL class abilities use magicka, regardless of which one you choose. So it's very difficulty to make a stamina based class that doesn't use magicka at all.\n\nSecondly, there are some tech issues that can be very annoying, such as the "0.01" error that happens when trying to sign in(Not sure if this happens often to anyone else). Although that's usually fixed with repairing the game.\n\nThirdly, this is more opinionated but I dislike the racial system, where each race has a certian skill tree of their own. It takes away the freedom of customization.\n\nOn a side note, this game still is not boring. With 150 hours in and still going strong, I feel this game is very well worth $60. If you're tired of looking for an online game you can quest, adventure, and level up with friends then I would highly suggest this game.","January 28, 2015","true","207.5"," 352 of 526 people (67%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","67","352","526","20","0"

I reinstalled on whim a couple of months ago and was pleasantly surprised to find that the game had much improved. While it's still not the Elder Scrolls MMO I would have designed it's still very good and the removal of the monthly sub makes it worth keeping around.\n\nRandom points:\n\nIt's still a thempark MMO, with all the pluses and minuses that entails.\nThe justice system is fun and adds a lot of flavor.\nGoing off the beaten track is worthwhile to find things most people will miss.\nElder Scrolls fans will find plenty of juicy lore bits.","March 19, 2015","true","825.3"," 135 of 189 people (71%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","71","135","189","6","0"

Its not a gaggle of Nords and Dunmer like Skyrim or Morrowind.\nESO abandoned Skyrim's equipable and underpowered magic system in favour of a hotkey system, meaning you can fight with a greatsword or Bow and still use magic, just like in Oblivion.\nThe main plot of Oblivion was basically rebooted in ESO, I would argue, more effectively so.\nMolag Bal is a better villian to attempt to take over Tamriel than Mehrunes Dagon was in Oblivion.\nIn my opinion, Anchors are more intimidating than Gates.\n\nThe graphics are amazing, you can revisit Skyrim, Cyrodiil, or Morrowind without commiting to one Province's climate.\nThe voice acting is phenomenal. Every single character is voiced. You won't only be hearing the same three people putting on accents to sound like Nords or Khajiit, you will hear iconic voices like John Cleese, Bill Nighy, Michael Gambon, Malcolm Mcdowell, Alfred Molina, and another 70 professional voice actors. I am spoiled after playing this game, I can barely read my own review without expecting to hear Dumbledore or Doc Oc telling me about how I'm the chosen one.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point, all of the "Main Quest" missions where you encounter characters who interact with your personal progress are Single Player Instances. So you WILL NOT see other players talking to the Prophet. As far as you know, you are the only "Souless One", just like you thought you were the only "Dovahkiin", "Champion of Cyrodiil", or "Nerevarine". Also, the entire world is instanced in a way that prevents you from seeing players who have saved a city from destruction until you, yourself, have also saved the city.\n\nMost importantly, an Online Elder Scrolls is constantly being updated and patched. Overpowered exploits and glitches are fixed on an ongoing basis, you can't cheat your way through the game like you could in Morrowind or Oblivion. No more rushed questlines leading to plot holes and half-baked concepts, like in Skyrim.\n\nIt's not Skyrim 2.0,\nIt's Better.","August 19, 2014","true","99.2"," 945 of 1,459 people (65%) found this review helpful 50 people found this review funny","65","945","1","50","51"

The skills in game don't seem to have a decent GCD and you can't "queue" skills to be used in succession, while normally this would be fine in a single player game, in an online game with latency, it's important to have some leeway with timing.\n\nMultiple times I found the music and ambient sounds just stopping for no reason, I found an Argonian blacksmith with the soundbank of an Orc blacksmith and occasionally my weapon wouldnt make any sound whatsoever when in use, not great for a bow user, especially when half of the time my arrows didn't even appear after being shot.\n\nFurther to this, the game would often just fail to load an area and I'd be looking at an empty camp for 30 seconds while the game tried to remember who to pop in there, i'd load into an area only to be attacked by enemies that hadn't even rendered on screen yet.\n\nNot to mention missing models in game that are just placeholders of a big red box that says "MISSING" 3 times down either side, way to break immersion by just not including all resources in the initial download, no Zenimax, i'm not going to trawl your support forum looking for files to drop into my directory.\n\nHonestly, if you can bring yourself to download this, which is (I believe) currently one of if not "the" biggest download on Steam right now, then try it just to make sure you don't like it, sort of like you would with pegging or dripping chilli sauce onto your eyeball, just make sure you cancel your subscription before you're charged.\n\nHaving said that, if my £50 helps to develop Fallout 4 or TESVI then I can let it slide.\n\nTreat this like you treated Redguard, it just never happened, and we shall never speak of it again.","July 23, 2014","false","4.8"," 717 of 1,106 people (65%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","65","717","1","14","11"

But now, you don't need a subscription to play, and the steady updates made the game much more enjoyable.I've been playing on a non-steam version for a while, before I picked it up on Steam.\nHere's a list of what are, in my opinion, the pros and cons of the game:\n\nPros:\n+Huge hand crafted map, way bigger than any previous Elder Scrolls\n+Lots of side quests and NPCs interactions\n+Solo player friendly: if you don't like MMOs, it's fine, just play on your own for a classic Elder Scrolls experience\n+The PvP system is really well made : fight for your faction in a huge open map, take the enemy forts and scrolls to bring victory to your cause!\n+Fair microtransaction system: you don't need to buy costumes or mounts : you can get some by playing the game\n+The crafting and motif system is great : you can craft powerful AND beautiful armors and weapons, and choose their appearance\n+The game is absolutely gorgeous, the landscapes are breathtaking\n+The soundtrack is as good as ever\n+Curiosity is rewarding: there's a lot of thing you can find if you take the time to explore everything\n+Modding is really easy: there's a lot of mod to improve the UI, the map, etc... (to start modding, you can go on ESOUI, or download Minion, a modding client for ESO\n+The DLC are really complete, Orsinium gives you access to a whole new zone with its own main and side quests\n+The lore, as always, is great. You get to play in an era never explored in an Elder Scrolls before\n+Forky's back!\n\nCons:\n-It's a MMO, so there's a class system, which can be a little restrictive, but joining NPC guilds and groups can give you acces to new skill branches, so you can work around it\n-The game is not optimized for high end graphic cards, so you might experience lower FPS than you would expect\n-The voice acting gets a little redundant: after a while, you start recognizing the same voices\n-The NPCs animation are a little stiff\n-I don't enjoy the main quest a lot, but I didn't enjoy it in Oblivion and Skyrim either, and you can just ignore it\n-Heavily populated PvP campaign can get guite laggy\n-This game involves cheese, stay away if you do not like fondue\n\nTo conclude, a tip to enjoy this game is to play it without trying to level-grind or optimize your characters: everything is viable, you can play anything from khajiit stealth archer to orc mage until you get to endgame, so just try to have fun!","December 4, 2015","true","411.1"," 67 of 84 people (80%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","80","67","84","8","2"

But like everyone says, it does not "completely" feel like an "Elder Scrolls" game. It just feels like your average MMO. But it's a great MMO at that.\n\nThe main quest is kind of average too. You're basically just "The Chosen One" sent to correct the evil that is corrupting the land. Nothing original.\n\nAnother thing to note that like most MMORPGs, this is a huge XP grind fest. So make sure you have enough time on your hands to level up and start completing them quests. Those quests will help you level fast and give you a good sum of gold too.\n\nOh yes and one thing to note about the Imperial Edition. Although it does give you a free horse and trust me, it takes 10,000 gold to get your first horse, one thing it fails to mention and something I learned the hard way. I thought the Imperial Edition granted the ability to play as any race in any faction. But turns out, that only applies to the new Imperial race you get in the imperial edition. It only grants Imperials the ability to be in any faction.\n\nIf you want to do that, you'll have to purchase the Adventurer's Pack which costs 1,500 crowns if I recall. Now before you start calling and whining about it being "Pay 2 Win", please hear me out. Most of what you spend with "crowns" which is a currency you get with real money, are mostly just cosmetics. Pets, costumes and etc. Most of these things don't grant you an advantage over others.\n\nThe only way to get better is to get better gear, level up, figure out your own playstyle, play your class to its fullest extent and basically, just be good at the game. You don't need to spend any crowns to get any sort of strength over others. You get almost all of your strength from crafting, buying and leveling up. They all involve getting "gold" which is of course, the "in-game" currency. So if you're afraid this might be "Pay to win", toss that thought out the window right now. You're safe.\n\nThe only gripe I have is that the quests are just uninteresting, which I often just skip most of the dialouge to try and complete the boring quest as fast as I can and most of the achievements can be very difficult to complete. Most of the achievements unlock dyes for you to color your armor and clothing. But the most rarest of dyes are rewarded on the most hardest of achievements. But you'll feel glad when you get them, because these rare dyes are shiny than the common ones and I like shininess on my clothes and armor.\n\nAll in all, it's a very good MMO. But again, don't expect it to play like an Elder Scrolls game. Manage your expectations and just treat the game as a good ♥♥♥♥♥♥me and not an Elder Scrolls game.","May 17","true","265.7"," 61 of 75 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","61","75","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/swiftyswift7/recommended/306130/","swiftyswift7","LoKi0nE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/swiftyswift7/","57 products in account","I've sunk 9 years into World of Warcraft because everytime I took a break from the game, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MMO I was playing to substitute for it would absolutely suck and get boring after a while. This is the game that has gotten me away from World of Warcraft, and managed to make me sit down for a full 16 hours on my first night playing.\n\nThe amount of new content coming towards this game is undescribable, you should all really check up on what's coming.\n(The Theives Guild, The Dark Brotherhood)\nA Justice system where you can still from NPC's and go to prison for doing so (if you get caught obviously).\n\nHere's my review after around 50+ hours. (ignore the steam play time.)\n\nPROS:\n- GRAPHICS 8.5/10\nAmazing detailed graphics, you feel a part of the environment and scenery, just exploring the map feels "fun" and not like a chore with most MMORPG's, and each environment is captivating from snow covered mountain tops to lush green forests. Not to mention the size of Tamriel is HUGE. With graphics better then most MMORPG's to date, this game definetely takes the cake with it's true blue original Elder Scrolls feel.\n\n- CRAFTING 7/10\nESO has made crafting the most simplest yet intricate and unique system to date in my honest opinion, it almost follows the Skyrim crafting mechanics but maybe a bit less features. A lot of the best gear in the game can be created just from crafting, in fact I think most players prefer to craft their own gear. You can specialize in all crafting sets (Blacksmith, Woodworker, Clothier, Enchanter etc.) without having to quit one just to be able to use another. Just like most games, crafting materials can be found across the world like Iron Ores, Maple Tree's and Jute Patches.\n\n- CLASS CREATION 8/10\nThe way classes and skills work in this game is by far my favourite aspect of the combat system. Most people get annoyed when they find out there are only 4 classes, however this is not actually the case.\nFor example, I can roll a Nightstalker (Rogue character) who relies primarily on magick attacks and dual wielding attacks with medium armor equipped! Now, I can roll the exact same class except he could be primarily based on stamina and physical attacks and use a bow with heavy armor! This is just a vague example but you really have to give it a shot yourself to understand the feel of it\n\n- COMBAT SYSTEM 9/10\nA non-targeting based hack and slash with dodge/manevour & aiming elements = Greatest thing to happen to MMO's ever! Although this isn't the first MMO with this combat system, it is BY FAR the first MMO to actually perfect it in my total honest opinion. The combat is so fluid and smooth that it actually feels like a singleplayer game half the time, not to mention when you're out killing mobs and it doesn't feel as repetive. The fact I can be a Sorcerer in Heavy Armor wielding a bow is just an amazing concept because the PVE and PVP builds are endless and you can perfect any class you decide to work on properly.\n\n- LOOT SYSTEM 8/10\nI love walking to my quest destination, just to come across a couple of chests that have a lock on them, as I went to pick the lock of a chest for the first time I felt surprised that they kept the original Elder Scrolls method of breaking locks (Lifting up the 5 compartments to get the precious loot). It's an awesome feature and I'm glad it was implented so well into the game. Chests in the open world are despawned as soon as one player has opened it, however in dungeons the chests will be available to have different loot for all players in the party. The gold drop rates are great, not to high and not to low, so goldfarmers can't create a habit of destroying the economy.\n\nCONS:\n- QUESTING\nQuest grinding.. The amount of running around and NOT killing stuff when doing quests is actually ridiculous, I understand that they were trying to steer away from the general kill a bunch of monsters 10x and collect this 5x grinding system, but this really isn't a great alternative. However, the storylines are generally impressive though and do make for a good cut scene sometimes. 4.5/10\n\n- BAG SYSTEM\nYou start with 60 slots of empty spaces in your bag and it costs 400 to get another 10. Your bag usually fills up after one long quest chain so this can get very annoying. 4/10\n\n- CURRENT PVP SYSTEM (COMBAT IS GREAT, BATTLEGROUNDS AREN'T)\nThe massive battlegrounds are just way to big unless you have everyone from the server damn near playing at once, although this issue should be fixed in the upcoming patches and updates where they will most likely add smaller battleground systems.\n\n\nOVERALL!\n8/10\n\nA MUST PLAY!\n\n","February 3, 2015","true","133.0"," 285 of 430 people (66%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","66","285","430","16","7"

I have not read any of the other reviews here so there may or may not be overlap, but I wanted to say how I feel about it.\n\n-The game in its current form has exceptionally good graphics, easily the best in any MMO I have played.\n\n- The generic user interface is simple to the point of not displaying pertinent information until the game thinks you need    it. ie, your experience bar...\n\n-Targeting in combat is clunky and sometimes difficult, but get in a group for a dungeon and, for all of us not so not so autistically good at games, downright frustrating.\n\n-There is no gui to show buffs/debuffs/hots etc. This may be linked to a greater feeling of "realism" but they do in fact exist in the game, and there is know way to tell unless you enter the character screen and check. This of course does not apply to dots or debuffs on enemies, you just have to have faith they are there.\n\n-The quests are ok the first time around, but try them the second go through and they become so tedious you actually get frustrated.\n\n-The bank tabs require you to quit and re-enter multiple times in order to move items around. This may sound trivial, but it gets really annoying if you forget something or are emailing items from two bank tabs. And the cost to upgrade those tabs is the highest I have seen in games I have played.\n\n-Money generation in the game is very very slow, so slow in fact that you are forced to join trading guilds in order to make any significant amount. This is all well and good I suppose except even that mechanic is based on your luck at finding or salvaging items other people will buy. At higher levels you make more gold, but by then it becomes about tweeking your character, instead of say, buying materials to build sets for leveling.\n\n-The versatility of the crafting system is really good. The major problem with it is that you can't really outfit another character that does not share your item types. For example you create a medium armour character and research all of the intrinsic traits (which could take months btw). If you then create a heavy armour class, by the time you could make them named sets (due to research times) you would level out of the zone and usefulness of the items.\n- the majority of the armour sets are ugly or boring, and the modeling for many of the pieces is so bad they just\nhang in mid air.\n\n- ***Items purchased from the crown store only apply to the character that purchased it. Thats right, if you want daedric crafting styles for all eight of your characters be ready to shell out $120.... and there are four different crafting styles like this, or five I cant remember.\n- It is probably no accident that they are the nicest looking sets in the game.\n\n- The endgame is ridiculous and designed to eliminate the need for zenimax to create more content. I wont say why due to spoilers, but you will get it if you make the mistake of buying this game.\n\n*BUT THE MAIN REASON TO NOT BUY THIS GAME IS THE TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE*\n\nAllow me to explain. When I first purchased this game it was still subscription based and I did not own a credit card. This was simple enough because it came with a free month of game time. After my purchase I discovered that in order to activate that free game time zenimax required me to link a credit card and they would attempt to bill it to make sure it was good. I sent out an email explaining my situation, and asking why I would need a credit card for free game time. The response took I believe two days to arrive and when it did instead of solving the problem tried to offer other billing solutions. It took quite awhile ( I believe four or five days total ) I finally got a representative to offer me a key that allowed me to play the game on just my free game time. I suppose I should be grateful they did anything at all, but I was now five days behind the friends who bought it with me.\nThe next blow came quite recently and is the nail in the coffin for me. After reporting an instance where I was constatly falling through the world, I received and email informing me that I had violated the code of conduct in naming my account. There was no recognition of the bug report, no reply to the incident at all, just an emaill that looked very much like a punishment for doubting the zenimax gods. Again, all responses took days to arrive until the final day in which I was told in no uncertain terms that if they decide something that is the way it goes. Period.\n\nThis is the short list, there are also inconsistencies in the lore, bad textures, long load times when entering zones and buildings etc etc. I would suggest you read all the reviews here in reference to this game, but keep in mind that depending where you are the price has not come down permanently since launch and the its pretty pricey for a two year old game.\n","September 25, 2015","false","837.7"," 431 of 685 people (63%) found this review helpful 47 people found this review funny","63","431","685","47","39"

I wish I could recommend this game... But as far as the bottom line goes, it's your generic MMORPG with an Elder Scrolls skin. Extremely disappointing.\n\nIf the game wasn't completely predictable, meaning if every area and event weren't exactly the same, ESO might be fun. Instead all you do is follow one pattern: get a main quest which leads you to a new area that has a series of side quests. You complete these side quests until you're high enough level to do the main quest, and then the process repeats in each and every area. After 33 hours I've hit maybe level 34 while playing with my friend and have yet to run into a compelling, fun, challenging boss during any questline. Every boss was either the exact same piles of bones as the last one, some skeletons, or a 'strong' magister that terrorizes the land and!... dies in 5 hits.\n\nThere's next to no challenge in this game. I've only died when I screwed up, whacked a guard, then got pummled to death in 5 hits with no chance to react. Sneaking around guards to sell stolen goods is fun. At first. After the 50th time there's a clear and obvious pattern that you follow for 100% success which, in turn, makes stealing boring with no worry of consequences. How is this true to the Elder Scrolls style? The health and stamina bars may be Skyrim, but the skill system is totally watered-down MMORPG with small trees and limited choices. The lore might be Elder Scrolls, but the method of storytelling where you just can't give a crap is MMORPG. Anytime there are books or scrolls you're bombarded with 2000 words of text that you just can't be bothered reading, even though I loved reading books in Oblivion and Skyrim and Morrowind. The combat is... sadly, MMORPG, and feels like you're slicing through cardboard because there's next to no feedback on the attacks. Monsters spawn in dedicated locations, removing all randomness you get in Oblivion of running into a minotaur or in Skyrim of fighting off a spriggan or Morrowind of dying to some random mage in a cave.\n\nIn the first few areas the buildings have the exact same layout. Why? No one can explain why to me. Laziness on the developer's part? There wasn't a sense of grandness in the lore being told and I really had no reason to pay attention anyway because of the horrendous voice acting. Seriously, this bothered me the most. A few characters are good (and for some reason the same 3 guys do all the major voices, did Zenimax not have the budget for more GOOD voice actors?) but the generic Kajiit and Argonians sound like they were forced to speak with a stupid accent for a low pay while being passed off as 'good enough'. It's not immersing at all and you just wind up turning off voices altogether to save your ears of their terrible attempt at the Elder Scrolls races. I don't think I've heard voice acting this shoddy since Assassins Creed 3.\n\nBesides that all that, it's a decent run of the mill MMO with Elder Scrolls thrown in. There's a lot to do, repetitive though it is, and the graphics are cool. Now that there's no subscription it's definitely worth $60 and a playthrough since you get more out of it than you do on say Call of Duty single player but I couldn't stick around till level 50. Even having said it's worth $60, I can't recommend actually spending full price on it. Wait for a sale.","July 9, 2015","false","33.6"," 470 of 759 people (62%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","62","470","759","31","33"

Some people stuck with the game while others threw it out of the window.  Those who stuck with the game got to see it grow and develop into the wonderful game it is today.  Most of the bugs have been refined, with my ~4 hours of TU gameplay, i haven't seen any bugs yet (gameplay or graphical).  It plays really nice, the combat is fluid and feels very unique to me.  The quests (so far) aren't repetative, not even the side quests.  Crafting is really nice, I was very proud when I made my first set of Iron Armor.  Something really interesting about the game is that it seems every race has it's own armor fit for the body style of the race (if you've ever played Skyrim and seen the Orc armor, it's unique like that, the Khajit have there own style of armor a long with every other race, Iron armor for one race, won't look the same as Iron armor for the other Race.) < Now, does this mean that I can't be a Nord and wear the armor of another race? From what I've noticed, race locked armor is only locked in crafting until you find a set of books called Motifs which once you read them, you learn the corresponding races crafting style, but if you find another races' armor, you can wear it, I.E. My Nord Dragonknight is wearing Dark Elf Pauldrans and Helmet. (though... I stole them ;D)\n\nEnough of that, this is getting long enough and a bit sloppy (sorry). On to the features of the game.\n\n-Thievery: You can crouch and steal like in any Elder Scrolls game from merchants, if you get caught, you will get a bounty and guards will attack you.\n\n-Mounts: They started out with just horses, now they have Horses, lions and Guars (seen in TES III: Morrowind)\n\n-Raids: I don't have much to say about them, i'm only level 7 :)\n\n-3rd/1st person\n\n-Cyrodil is a warzone, all 3 factions vying for control of the Ruby throne in the Imperial City.  Guilds can control Keeps in Cyrodil.  I don't have much more information about pvp.\n\n-Explore "Most" of Tamriel, visit iconic areas like Skyrim, Cyrodil, Morrowind, etc.\n\nThis is my largest review, I really hope it helped atleast someone!

The creator is good and you have many options.\nNow comes my first -, because of the story of this game you can only choose a race to a specific faction.\nFor example, Orcs can only be created if you want to play for the Daggerfall alliance.\nIt is possible to remove this barrier, but I personly don't like this decision.\nAfter you created your char, and choose one of 4 classes, you get thrown into the tutorial area, that realy teaches you everything important pretty much like the jail in every Elder Scolls before.\nAfter that you get thrown into the world in a starting city.\n\nThe Gameplay:\nUnlike most other MMORPG's, ESO has nothing like Block,Parry,Evade chances. No the battle in ESO is active, you will constanstly moving around,use your spells and special moves,humanilate your mouse and try to kill everything in front of you that doesn't like you.\nThe basics of the combat system are Elder Scrolls like, left mouse button weak attack,hold the button for a heavy one, left mouse button is block. Added to this is a evade roll, a push move, that cancels casts and special moves as well as one ultimate move. Spells and special moves are placed in the qucikslot and you have 5 abilitys + one ultimate move.\nThe spells and abilitys reach from buffs,to damage,over tank and crowd controll to AoE buffs and debuffs. Pretty much like in every MMORPG.\nThe only real difference is the world. ESO is build a lot around exploring, you will find a lot quests just by walking around, always find new areas and slice,dice and burn you your way trough the world.\nThere are dungeons for groups and raids like in every MMO, there will always be something to do for your char.\n\nThe Classes:\nThe character creator offers 4 classes, each class specialised in 3 different areas.\nDragonknights for example have 3 skilltrees. You level these trees up, by killing mobs and completing quests, after it ranks up,you can skill new abilitys, make the old ones better,skill passiv buffs and so on.\nOne Skilltree the Dragonknight has is Irdenes Hearth, mainly a support tree with groupbuffs,some healing and some CC,as well some damage and Tank abilitys. The other two trees are a Tank and a DD tree.\nNow comes the clue, the classes are specialised, but don't have set armor or weaponry.\nYou want to creat a mage in heavy armor with a bow? Just do it! ESO will not say you how you're supposed to play the class. You have 3 trees and it's up to you how you build your character up.\nIn the capital citys of each alliance is it possible to reset all skillpoints for ingame money, the game wants you to experiemente and find your way to play your class effective.\nSo,JUST DO IT!\n\nThe World:\nThe World is cut into different areas. Each Alliance has 5-7 areas only your alliance can enter. There is it possible to collect ressources,chat with others,look for a group,steal things from NPC's,trade and of course look stupid.\nThe areas are pretty big and full of dungeons,citys and special places to explore.\nBut be aware, there're some Bosses in this areas. They're in their own camps don't worry,but they can be hard to beat alone, but are usualy possible to take on 1vs1. At least I never had problems with them.\nOther than that so called "Dolmen" are spread arcross the world. These things are the Oblivion gates of this game. You kill some kultists,then some Deadra and after that drops Molag Bal elite enemys to finish you. Theses enemys vary from big jokes to "omg I can't even scratch this guy!". And it's 100% random what elite mob will spawn, it can be a pushover or a freaking nightmare.\nAfter you cleared cold harbor, you can explore the areas of the other alliances. Metaareas, you won't be able to met or see players of other alliances there.\nAs soon you reach level 10 you can acces Cyrodiil. Cyrodiil is a big PvP battlefield,where the alliances fight for every little piece of ground. Or better. Does someone remember the destroyed fortresses in Oblivion? You basicly fight in them years before they were destroyed.\nThe world itself is beautifull and the areas of every alliance are very different, you will also be able to visit areas,you never visisted in a other Elder Scolls before,as well as revisit someone,aka Skyrim.\n\nThe System:\nESO builds on a one buy one game principe. You buy the game, you have it, you don't need to pay money to play it.\nHowever,the games adds expension as DLC. You can purchase them in the ingame shop.\nOutside of the DLC is nothing in the shop you need, a lot of prestige stuff, but nothing important.\nThe basegame however is already huge. Your own alliance + cold harbor = level 50. Thats the max level after the next update,you don't need any DLC's to reach the maxlevel,acces Cyrodiil or raids.\nHowever, there 2 DLC's I can just offer everyone. The Starterpack,what allows you to create any race at any alliance and the imperial edition. The imperial edition gives you another race as well as a free horse. It's worth it trust me.\n\nFazit:\nESO is a good game, it has a lot charm of the other Elder Scrolls,sometimes I even got nostalgia feelings as I quested in the Dominion.\nThe game looks good, it plays good and thx to the MEGASERVER! you will have all people of your continent on your server,always.","May 25","true","188.0"," 38 of 49 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","38","49","4","0"

Most of the time i'm just walking around and enjoying the view until one bad guy shows up and i'll kick the ♥♥♥♥ out of him. But after that i'll just run into a random direction and do some sidequest (sometimes you have to do a lot for those and you just want to kill them for saying: "can you do this litte think for me?" *ok* "Yea can you safe my entire village for those bad guys over there?" *...*.) But, when you're done with the quest you will recieve some items and some money and you will think if maybe it was all worth it. And When you do some sidequest and someone says he's gonna run somewhere you can actually find them at that location later and talk to them. That's something i really really like.\n\nthe main story, the main story is big. So much story and characters, every faction has it's story and their own way of thinking. When you're in Daggerfall you will hear ♥♥♥♥ about Aldmeri and when you're in Aldmeri you will hear ♥♥♥♥ about Daggerfall. You can improve skill to persuade people so you don't have to run across the map for them. And by doing the actions you choose, the story will continue with the changes you made.\n\nBUT(T) this game is NOT perfect so here are some Pros and cons.\n\nProsStory: It's good\nmap: BIG\ncharacters, smart and with alot of story\nMusic, idk i just love it.\nConsImportant items/people disappearing: sometimes you need to grab an item but you'll only see a quest mark but no\nitem.\nglitches, like getting stuck or small things like windows missing.\nalot of people who still think this game has a monthly subscription.\npeople thinking this game is still as bad as it was on release.\nthat's all i have to say about this game for now. I'll definetly add more in the future when i reached level 50 or something.\nbai.","August 1, 2015","true","113.5"," 37 of 48 people (77%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","77","37","48","7","5"

Although it's different enough to still be new and exciting.\n\nThe quests are ALL voice acted which was a total win from my point of view. It is really easy to emerse yourself into this new world.\n\nMost activities/quests are soloable, and for the ones you might struggle with the community (in my opinion) is always ready to help. I've had no problems in getting aide to fight big bosses or clear dungeons and everyone is usually pretty friendly.\n\nThere is a strong RP community if you are so inclined. For those that dislike rp don't worry, they keep it to group chat for the most part and it will not effect your gaming experiance.\n\nI have a fairly old computer but have no problems running this game on maxed graphics, the graphics are just a step up from skryim although not that noticably.\n\nCombat is fairly smooth, with few bugs.\n\nOther pros:\n- It's FREE to play. No subscription.\n- the mounts have a more realistic movement which can make some of them look a little foolish (bear and lion). I list this as a pro as I really like their attempt at realism in their animals.\n- leveling up your mounts carry capacity also increases you own bag slots.\n- Some of the specialised attacks have amazing animations\n- some of the scenes are down right stunning (background and foreground)\n- interface is easy to use and you can play with it hidden, with ease.\n- crafting is similar to that in skyrim and easy to navigate.\n- with some quests you get the option to be evil (kill someone) or good (save that someone). This seems to effect what the npc's say to you as you ride past them, but does not effect the quests. It can however effect your rewards for that quest though. ( I list this as a pro because I like having the option to kill an annoying or stupid character rather than save them)\n\nCons:\n- questing can drag out a little, especially when the quest itself seems a little foolish or pointless.\n- Player market. Now to me this was a big con. The market is different depending on the npc you talk to as each npc is owned by a different guild. Only the guild that owns that npc may post listings. But anyone can buy them. So unless you're in a guild that owns one of these npc's you won't be able to sell anything for a profit. Not all guilds have this npc either, so be careful when joining that you ask if they have one and where it is. I found this aspect to be a massive pain in the ♥♥♥ as I like playing the market and selling my crafted goods in other mmo's as it is an easy and simple way to make gold. I do understand why it has been done this way, and it is an interesting system and idea; but as a new player this was just frustrating as I could not find what I needed easily. Because all the npc's are seperate markets they only sell what the guild posts. They are not universially linked. So you need to go to each one looking for what you need and for which one has the better prices. This can be extremely frustrating as these npcs are spread out through many maps and cities and traveling between them can take alot of time.\n- LFG system -  doesn't really work. You can sit there for hours and never get a group. It is faster and easier to recruit from chat instead.\n\nThere are many other aspects to this game that I enjoyed and that I didn't enjoy, but I will still continue to play it and I recomend that everyone here at least tries it once.","November 24, 2015","true","146.6"," 53 of 76 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","53","76","3","5"

I did beta test The Elder Scrolls Online, and did not overly care for the game then.  However, I figured I'd give it another go when it finally went on sale.  BIG MISTAKE.\n\nWhile the game is absolutely beautiful and has an amazing soundtrack, this is not enough to pull this game out of the gutter.   I went into this knowing full well that this was not "Skyrim".  Having played MMORPGs for 15+ years now, I was looking forward to the adaptation of the elder scrolls universe into MMO format.  With all the MMOs that have come and gone, you'd think the newer ones would have noticed what companies did right, and what they did wrong.  Zenimax Online is clueless, utterly clueless.\n\nThe biggest problem is, the game does not know what it is trying to be.  Sure, there are lots of people around, but it still feels like a single player game most of the time.  The group finder tool used to put together random parties for dungeons is absurd, it does not check that the right classes are being put into a random group.  Both attempts I had put me in a group without a healer, making the dungeon impossible to complete.\n\nSelling items to other players is a hassle and a real throwback to older MMOs like Everquest.  There is no public auction house like in most MMOs of the last decade.  Instead, there are guild shops.  Items are listed by members, and only available for purchase by other members, severely limiting a customer base.  This in turn has people flooding the zone chats with their wares in hopes of finding a buyer.\n\nThe crafting system is decent, however VERY tedious.  You would think that the most effective way to level up a craft would be to actually craft stuff right?  Wrong, in ESO, you get by far the most exp by breaking items apart into their base ingrediants.  This itself isn't a bad thing, however, the experience difference is so big, that it makes leveling through creating items feel like a waste of time.  The crafting can not be automated like in most MMOs, so you are stuck sitting there tapping the "R" key every few seconds (just like in Skyrim).\n\nThe combat system is clunky at best for an MMO.  Healing especially is hard to deal with.  After my failed attempts to run a dungeon due to lack of healing, I created a healer and leveled it up enough to do the first dungeon.  It was painful to say the least.  There is no targeting someone and casting a heal spell on them.  Almost all of the heal spells are area of effect based, and target seemingly random wounded allies.  It does not prioritize the most wounded, and with target number limits, more often than not, the people who need healing the most, do not get it.  There are some spells that are single target, however, targeting them is so much more diffficult with this combat system.  Standing still is a no-no in this game, there are always lots of enemy abilities causing you to move.  Casting a spell on another player requires facing them and having your reticule over them when you hit the button.  If they are comstantly moving, it becomes very difficult to actually hit them with your spell.  If they move right as you cast the spell, you instead cast it on yourself, wasting the resources it took to cast it.\n\nThose of you that have played previous Elder Scrolls and Fallout games, will know that bugs were commonplace and usually left for the modders to fix.  Apparently that philosophy carries over to the online version as well.  The game is plagued by so many bugs, you would expect it to still be in beta.  I personally experienced a bug that forced me to log out and back in if I killed an enemy using a specific ability.  It left me unable to interact with anything because it thought I was still in combat.  I skimmed through their customer support forums, lots of reported bugs, but I didn't find a single response from their customer service team.\n\nMy verdict, only play this game if you are interested in the lore, as there is tons of it.  All quests and dialogues are voice acted, which is nice, however, all that voice acting does make the game file size insanely large.  They also reuse previous voice actors.  It felt a little odd hearing one of the commonly used voices from Skyrim in ESO.  Even if you find this game on sale again, it is not worth it.  Judging by the number of guilds full of people dying out due to inactivity, this game will go free to play or shut down completely within a year.","July 24, 2014","false","108.0"," 281 of 466 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","281","466","4","3"

Have Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim currently on HDD and still play them, and love every single one of them for various reasons. Someone who has played various MMO's , pretty much every big one there is. Including WoW for many years. I review this game as following...\n\nIn short : Is this game as good as the single player ones? - Not quite, but pretty close.\nIs this game a good compared to other MMO's ? - Depends on what you're looking for , but i'd say ..Hell yes.\nDoes this game stay true/loyal to the elder scrolls world ? - Absolutely.\nDoes this game stay true to the gameplay aspects and experience of elder scrolls - This is an MMO, and because of it it's somewhat limited to that, so not quite the same experience.\n\nI'm going to write my personal LIKE and DISLIKE list here to make it simple, easy and accessable without writing a 500 page novel.\n\nWhat I like/good qualities :\n- The world itself, the environment , the characters , NPC's and all that . This game has a very rich world, full of lore and beauty. In fact design and beauty wise this is absolutely richest and either better or at least equal to SP games. Every NPC is fully voice acted and they have personalities , and they always have something new to say depending on your progress in some quest, or depending on it's outcome. The character's are funny, they're very much like ones we know from single player games.\n- The Story. This game has by far one of the best main story and side quests of any MMO I played. In fact I have found various small side quests that are far better written and more interesting than in it's single player counterparts.\n- The content in this game is pretty massive. I have played quite a while and I barely scratched the surface. There's a lot of quests , ok ? And A lot of areas to explore. If you love the world of elder scrolls, the lore, so on you're definitely getting your money's worth.\n-Combat : it's damn fun. Very engaging. You swing your sword, you block , you dodge, so on. And the game has various skill trees and so on. It's good.\n-Freedom : One thing that's REALLY great in this game is that it breaks the typical bs mmorpg restrictions.. If you want to play as a mage wearing full plate armor and smash your enemies with 2 handed mace , battleaxe or maul - GUESS WHAT? YOU CAN ! You can pick from various classes, but that doesn't quite determinate or set in stone how you're going to play .\n- It has the most immersive world of any mmorpg. I was mindblown when I saw a dog running around sniffing animal tracks and bushes. NPCs don't just stand there , they walk around, do stuff. They work. I saw a guy chop wood then carry the wood around. You see people carry around barrels as well and all kinds of things.\n- Dialogue choices : You can choose your dialogue to learn more about what you're doing, but also to make crutial choises that will alter the outcome of given quest or questline. Considering this is an MMO I found it very impressive.\n- Quests ! Again! : There's various quests that are twisted, and it's up to you to decide the fate of some characters and so on. Its sometimes really dark, thought provoking with a lot of gray moral area. And I really loved it.\n- Emotes : They're so hilarious. You can actually blend in with the NPCS and do the stuff they do, and you almost can't tell the difference.\n- Crafting : OH YES. Never have I enjoyed gathering things and crafting as much as I do in this game, In fact this is far superior than in Skyrim. I love to gather materials as I quest and then make myself armor and weapons, there's so many of them , so many different styles, and it's really fun and useful , it's nothing like I seen in typical MMOs\n- Professions : They're really fun . Exploring the world gathering everything you find, is actually quite rewarding and worth it. Playing around with alchemy, mixing potions, discovering various properties - very fun ! gathering runes, making your own enchantments, cooking ! making food is actually damn useful in this game as they give you very nice bonuses. Blacksmithing, Clothing , Woodworking , so on they're very fun, not restricting, not forced either. Do whatever you want\n-Graphics : I honestly don't care about them. I mean I play vanilla Morrowind and it doesn't bother me at all. So I'd say they look BEAUTIFUL. But nowadays everyone complain about it , so I don't know man. Up to you.\n\n- PvP : I'm not saying PVP is bad in this game, it's just not WHAT I PERSONALLY would like. You can't kill enemy faction players while questing , corpse camp them , raid them , whatever all the good' times from WoW. For PvP there's an active warzone , Cyrodiil, fimilar from Oblivion. All the factions are fighting for that prized land , and there is where they clash. If you love large scale battles , like sieges with a lot of people, catapults , so on all that kind of things. Kinda like World vs World in Guild Wars 2 - THEN THIS IS YOUR GAME, BECAUSE THAT IS AMAZING in this game. While the quests never made me feel like there's a war going on.. the PvP in this game will DEFINITELY make you feel the WAR that's going on in this world.\n\nWhy I hate this game : Uh ..now that I think of it, there's not a lot.\n- Questing.  What I love in elder scrolls is the freedom, you walk around, you go wherever you want, you do whatever you want. Someone gives you a quest and you don't feel like doing it. You tell them LOL NO TY or whatever you want. This game however is still an MMO and you're kinda forced to do the quests, I wish entire thing would be a lot more optional than it is .\n\nCompanions - In elder scrolls it's typical to have companions , wether it's another person or a dog, they follow you around, aid you in combat, and carry your items so on. I honestly don't understand why is this not in the game, but it sucks that it's not. Probably the sucky game engine. There are pets in the game , like dogs and so on. but I don't like using them , because it doesn't feel immersive at all. They're useless. They don't do or react in any when to combat, and you can't pet them or interact with them, which again is stupid.\n\nImmersion - While it's great compared to MMO's .. there's also some that are really stupid and break it. For an example when game tries to be more serious and paints you this picture during a quest where you're under attack or there's some epic war going on, it looks pathetic. Just some FEW static NPCS locked in eternal combat, it looks really lame . But I try to cut them some slack it's mostly the old outdated quests when they game was a lot more crappy. So if you looked at the game trailer and say THIS IS WHAT I WANT, then ..well i'm sorry to say but that's a lie, and that's not how the game really looks like.\n\nExploration - While the game is very fun to explore, with very rich world full of things. It's not quite as special as playing single player. The dungeons work more like they do in MMO's than they do in elder scrolls games.\n\nTo sum up : I feel like this MMO was definitely a step forward in a right direction, but unfortunately this game started as nothing but a money grab. However over time they have really improved and made this game one of the best MMOs that's out there right now. But because of the crappy start they're somewhat limited to that, they can't like remake the game engine and redo everything , so on. It doesn't have the best foundation all im saying. If they would have worked harder on it before release then it could have been the best elder scrolls game so far. And the best mmorpg.\n\nIs this worth your money ?? Well if you can barely pay your rent then ..Probably not ? If you're ok and love elder scrolls universe , or ..like any of the things you see in here. Then ABSOLUTELY YOU MUST BUY IT. THE CONTENT IS GREAT AND THERE'S A LOT OF IT. If you want a game where you can bury yourself for HUNDREDS OF HOURS then YES. THIS IS YOUR GAME !

You get the typical MMO style of hubs, with packs of mobs standing around waiting for you to attack them. The story is not very engaging and the cliché repetitive nature of mmorpg shopping list questing comes into play.\n\nFrom an MMORPG point of view the game feels like a shell. No nameplates, poor communication options and a lack of social tools all make the game feel like it was designed from the ground up for consoles. The dungeons are boring, the PvP leave much to be desired and your actions feel like they have little impact.\n\nAll in all the game is a solid 5/10 as buy2play.

Honestly, I think ESO is a very entertaining and enjoyable MMO, but it's exactly that: an MMO.  While it's nice to dream of the full single-player Elder Scrolls experience, but online, ESO provides an experience that (while it pales in comparison to said experience) is very fun for what it is.\n\nMy main critique of the game is whole idea behind the Imperial edition of the game, something I'm sure has been complained about on more than one occasion here.  Barring off an entire race is pretty stupid, in addition to the whole any race, any alliance perk.  While valid points could be made as to how this COULD (in certain contexts) make sense from a lore perspective, chances are it will be pretty hard to justify a Nord dragonknight fighting for the Aldmeri Dominion.  It is important to note though, that the faction system as a whole is pretty restrictive, as it makes choosing one's favorite race and playing with friends a bit troublesome if the race selected doesn't fall into the same faction as the others'.  This, however, is quite overshadowed by the other benefits owners of the Imperial edition receive that others do not, such as the increased rate of XP gained through the rings of Mara and the exclusive loot they may find.\n\nOverall?  Great game.  I enjoy looting dungeons, waging battles and completing quests with friends.  While it's no Skyrim or Oblivion, ESO brings something new entirely to the table, and I would recommend it to Elder Scrolls fans (particularly all the lore buffs out there) and fans of MMORPGs.","May 13","true","26.7"," 31 of 42 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","31","42","2","0"

Crack the eggs into the middle, then pour in about 50ml milk and 1 tbsp oil. Start whisking from the centre, gradually drawing the flour into the eggs, milk and oil. Once all the flour is incorporated, beat until you have a smooth, thick paste. Add a little more milk if it is too stiff to beat.\nFinishing the batter: Add a good splash of milk and whisk to loosen the thick batter. While still whisking, pour in a steady stream of the remaining milk. Continue pouring and whisking until you have a batter that is the consistency of slightly thick single cream. Traditionally, people would say to now leave the batter for 30 mins, to allow the starch in the flour to swell, but there’s no need.\nGetting the right thickness: Heat the pan over a moderate heat, then wipe it with oiled kitchen paper. Ladle some batter into the pan, tilting the pan to move the mixture around for a thin and even layer. Quickly pour any excess batter into a jug, return the pan to the heat, then leave to cook, undisturbed, for about 30 secs. Pour the excess batter from the jug back into the mixing bowl. If the pan is the right temperature, the pancake should turn golden underneath after about 30 secs and will be ready to turn.\nFlipping pancakes: Hold the pan handle, ease a fish slice under the pancake, then quickly lift and flip it over. Make sure the pancake is lying flat against base of the pan with no folds, then cook for another 30 secs before turning out onto a warm plate. Continue with the rest of the batter, serving them as you cook or stack onto a plate. You can freeze the pancakes for 1 month, wrapped in cling film or make them up to a day ahead.","December 23, 2014","true","256.1"," 743 of 1,291 people (58%) found this review helpful 1,214 people found this review funny","58","743","1","214","24"

Not infested with obnoxious people every where like you might fear (although I'm sure there are Disciples of Sheogorath out there somewhere on the server)\n\nCons:\n1) People running around CAN improve the experience, but it is utterly annoying/distracting 85% of the time. I know, its an MMO, but when you get stuff like: "you are the chosen one, sent to a hidden cave that only you know about to defeat an evil only you can stop....'cept, you know, those 20 other dudes strutting around in the same cave"\n2) First person view is not good; puts you at a signifcant disadvantage compared to 3rd person view during combat\n3) *The sense of adventure is not quite there* This is a big one. The main gripe here is because of MMO's zoning, you cant go wherever you want, whenever you want. This was a crucial part of what made Skryim seem so big. Also, exploring isn't quite the same--you either find nothing, or you find a start of a big quest. There's no inbetween, small little caves filled with Trolls or small huts where a fisherman was just killed by a bear.\n4) **Never connected w my character** This one is hard to explain, and it might just be a personal problem, but I figured I might as well list it.\n\nI know, I know, those are abstract cons, but hey.\n\nIf you are on the fence, I HIGHLY recommend waiting until it is $20 on sale. It's not a bad pickup for that, even if you don't end up playing too much of it. Also I've heard that the updates since I've last played are darn good. I hope to get back into this game eventually, maybe before ES6 comes out","December 16, 2014","false","66.5"," 232 of 397 people (58%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","58","232","397","21","8"

I never played prior to the update, but that doesn't matter. Elder Scrolls Online gives you a fairly unique MMORPG experience. I, having played Runescape for the past 8 years, can not get enough of this title. The fighting is fun and upbeat, the quests are very diverse (I believe there are 3 entirely unique storylines) , and crafting is a very useful little game of it's own, requiring you to hunt, gather, craft and enchant. Leveling up is by no mean easy or quick, and there are 50 levels availible in the PvE mode. I myself have not messed with PvP, but it looks absolutely incredible. The reigon of battle is about 10 square miles and battles go on for hours, games for weeks. The game itself is unbelievably immersive as you will find exploring deserts, jungles, etc. It is also fairly easy to run, being able to run on most low end PCs with relative ease. Be careful, though; MMORPGs are not by any means for everyone. Patience is very important as is knowing what's going on, and in this game it also requires signifigant attention as opposed to something like Runescape. There are seldom bugs from what I have seen, though my game crashes very, very occasionally. There are some things missing that they need to add, like Group Members on the compass or Dragons, but the game has extraordinary potential and will be recieving a lot of DLC to come. It is also important to note that with the huge game itself, the server is huge too, and the game is likely >100GB at the moment. Overall, I give this game a 9.5/10. I find myself very attracted to this game, although someone like my brother would give a 6/10 as he dislikes MMORPGs. If you have enjoyed any games like Runescape, WoW, RotMG or even another Elder Scrolls game, I can't recommend this enough. Good luck in Tamriel.","July 25, 2015","true","103.4"," 30 of 41 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","30","41","0","0"

This game isn't a Single Player RPG, but it's not Quite an MMO either. Zenimax Online Studios and Bethesda have created a game that's it's own. This game's combined the much loved Bethesda RPG Formula and your standard MMO to create a hybid that accomplishes what it's set out to do.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls Online or "ESO" takes place all over Tamriel, the large continant that the entire Elder Scrolls Series takes place. ESO will take you places in Tamriel that you've always wanted to go, including revisiting places you've already been. For the Morrowind fans you can revist your harsh ashlands, and for the Oblivion fans Cyrodill is yours to explore (granted you can survive the bloody PVP battles.) If you've just played Skyrim that's fine too, parts of Skyrim are explorable, this includes major holds Riften and Windhelm.\n\nDispite being set two eras before Skyrim our races are still here. However they all stand divided into three factions. Depending on your choice of Faction differant races will be playable and by extension entirely differant parts of the world. For the fans of the world of The Elder Scrolls this game allows you to see it all, you can visit the Orcish tribes in Highrock, the magical island of Auridon, dry deserts by the border of Elsweyr, and so many more environments. For those who love the story and lore of the Series this game has HEAPS. Based before the rise of Tiber Septim there is so much story for you! Each Alliance has it's own seperate stories and questlines each one adding to the series lore. Dispite some claims, yes this game is Canon and it does make sense (trust me).\n\nThere's so much to say about this game! I haven't talked about the amazing PVP and PVE, the abilties! Or even the fantastic DLCs that are done perfectly! Zenimax Online Studios has had this game developing alongside Skyrim back pre-2011, and so much love has been put into this game, and it just get's better and better every update. This immersive game has a great story, with every NPC in the game voice acted too! The world design is breathtaking and the amount of fun you can have is multiplied when playing with friends. That doesn't mean you can't play solo though, as this game understands that solo players are prominant especially in a series like this. A variety of Solo dungeons and a main story that's almost entirely Single Player exist too! ESO knows just what to do to help you have a fun and immersive experience that's got so much nostalia without alienating new fans.\n\nBethesda better have their Soul Gems because if you come into ESO with an open mind you'll be pleasently surprised. This game is fun from the start and gets better and better as you level up.

This is without question an MMO, this is not the same as a stand alone ES game. If that is what you are looking for keep moving.\n\nAs MMO's go it is beautifully conceived, with living background a gorgeous visuals. It also has exciting combat that contrasts against the usual cool-down monotony of WOW clones. The quests are original and entertaining. With so much positivity what could be wrong? It isn't Elder Scrolls VI. It's that simple. Emersion is  constantly and consistently broken in over-populated dungeons with scores of other "one of a kind hero’s" slaying spiders. Let's talk about loot for a second, I was so excited when I took out my first enemy, I only got 1 gold, but that was okay it was my first level. At level five, I was still getting the 1 gold coin at level 10 I wasn't even shocked anymore. Any dreams I had of braving the horrors of forgotten dungeons and hauling massive amounts of treasure out where quickly snuffed out.  I could go on about how the feel was off, the backtracking, the horses, and the other nitpicky things that bugged me... but this review will probably never be read and this is just for me to vent my disappointment.\n\nIf you are wanting a very expensive MMO where you can say "Oooo I play pretty MMO's" then this is for you. If you want to feel like the Hero of Kvatch, just equip your boots of blinding speed and speed off. That's why I came to the party, and it feels like a member of the Dark Brotherhood has showed up to pick us off one by one with his dagger of disappointment.

This game is nothing like all the reviews from 2 years ago, which is GOOD. ESO is heavily quest oriented, and doing all of them in an area usually leaves me being a few levels over the content by the time I have to move on to the next zone. No need to grind at all for experience if you like questing.\n\nYou can spend HOURS just gathering resources if you wanted. They respawn fairly quickly. There is a skill that even makes them glow in the distance so you can see them from afar, and it's hard for me to resist gathering. Treasuring hunting is fun too, and chests are scattered around to be lock picked, and you can steal knicknacks out of containers to sell to a fence.\n\nA few cool things:\nYou can join up to 5 different player guilds at once.\nYou can reset your skills/attributes anytime, for a gold fee.\nThere are multiple ways to expand your inventory, but it does get pricey.\nMany crafting materials are shared across all level tiers.","April 19","true","259.6"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

Not much variety in tasks, easily generated in a few scripts with the game engine.\n\nBattles are mostly hack&slash with very little tactical elements, even simpler than Skyrim and not even remotely close to what Dark Souls has achieved.\n\nThat much is apparent from the very beginning of the game.\nIt does not look like those gameplay elements would improve since they are the core mechanic which is given to you from the very start and explained in detail.\n\nSo ESO does not have enough RPG elements to interest me and my opinion is formed based on what I've described here and thus in described in this review.\n\nCase closed.\n\nUPDATE: since this is no longer a subscription-based but purchase-once (like normal games) I've decided to look into this more. Unfortunately gameplay is same as before when subscription was in place: for example, you need mind-numbing amounts of grinding to collect crafting materials.\n\nThese kinds of things would really need overhauling to keep things interesting, it is too shallow and repetitive as it is.","July 24, 2014","false","5.3"," 249 of 429 people (58%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","58","249","429","6","19"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nekhs/recommended/306130/","Nekhs","Nekhs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nekhs/","35 products in account","Let me start by saying I played in the beta. For ... roughly five minutes, before going back to my beloved Skyrim. It simply did not hold my attention at the time.\n\nI'm pleased to report that this has changed.\n\nThe world is expansive and interesting. Sure, it's a theme park MMO - but it's a good one.\n\nLet's start with the quests. I've run into very few 'twenty bear asses' quests, and even those that are like that have lore and tie into larger quests, for the most part. Questing is really the best way to level, in my opinion - you can get more skill points that way, and run into more sky shards, lore books, and anchors - more on those later. Plus, it's just interesting. The stories aren't repetitive, and it's obvious the writers had some fun doing what they did.\n\nIf you don't like questing, there are alternatives, however: primarily, stabbing things in the face. Repeatedly.\n\nSo let's talk about combat.\n\nIt feels like Smite, a bit. Every attack is a skillshot, borrowing from MOBA terminology - you have to aim manually, rather than just tab targetting. You pick five abilities, a quickbar item, and an ultimate - and that's really all you can effectively use in combat. Surprisingly, that's enough. You pick your abilities intelligently, and you can do just about anything. Case in point: my level 13 vampire. The vampire quest requires you to kill level 38 enemies. Do the math. If I'd had the right abilities from the outset, I could have been a vampire at ten or less.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point - the customer service.\n\nSee, I'd been a little too trusting when I was hunting out an ... alternative life state, let's say. I was offered a chance at being horrifically mauled by a werewolf, and I accepted, eagerly. The guy who specifically offered me a bite, however, demanded five thousand gold up front, something I could barely afford. Still, I was being trusting, and I gave it to him. He then developed a mysterious case of werewolf ED, and couldn't complete the process. In troubleshooting, he suggested I log off, and so I did - whereupon he left group and ran off.\n\nThis sad tale got me a pity-bite from a vampire player, instead, which was lovely - but didn't get me back my gold.\n\nSo I reported the fellow who scammed me, thinking it wouldn't do much but vent my frustration.\n\nImagine my surprise when, the next morning, my gold was returned to me with an apology for the negative experience I encountered. The customer support representative did warn me that the market was very much 'buyer beware' and that they couldn't repeat this kindness - but really, getting 'bitten' once should be enough.\n\nSo that was nice.\n\nOther things of note:\n\n- My kleptomania is reaching critical mass. I'm making a decent profit by stealing literally everything I can get my grubby little Bosmer paws on. I'm curious if every faction has this many people trying to take anything that isn't nailed down, or if the Dominion - with Bosmer and Khajiit as two of the three member races - just has it particularly bad.\n\n- The guards are OP, in other unrelated news.\n\n- The game is not pay to win, so I bought a couple of things off the cash shop - cosmetic outfits and non-combat pets. I also acquired the 'any race, any faction' upgrade. It's nice, but not necessary - racial perks are just big enough to affect playstyle, without being game-breaking.\n\n- The download feels like forever, even on a fast connection - I don't want to contemplate what it would be like on, say, my 1mbps friend's internet. It's a big download, because it's a big game.\n\n- Explore everything. You might find something awesome.\n\n- I can't honestly comment on PvP - I haven't tried it yet.\n\n- I don't have to pay a subscription to maintain access to Tamriel.\n\n- I disagree with a previous commenter - with the sheer volume of weapon, armor, and skill point choices, each of my characters feels and plays differently. I feel unique without being useless, as I try on a nightblade (rogue) tank, healer, and DPS - all separate characters. There's optimal - and then there's playable. Optimal is a small, niche market - you can play anything you want, effectively.\n\nSo far, there are small things that bother me - Molag Bal doesn't encompass all of the portfolios he's given in this game, you know - but overall I thoroughly enjoy this title, and feel it's well worth the money I spent.","April 5, 2015","true","365.6"," 30 of 42 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","30","42","0","0"

Taiwan is an Earthquake region, so they can't just lay fiber-optic cable to improve everyone's way of life.  I am working with what is standard here... and from that... you get this review.\n\nLikewise --- I do realize my review has nothing to do with the GAME PLAY but rather the MEMORY HOG that the game is.   When I had written this, I hadn't played even one minute... all because of the stupid loops and fire-walking after the initial Download.\n\nThat said --- STEAM User Atlana said it best in the comments:   Why couldn't ESO / LeniMax simply have included all the patches in the original download?  And why do we have to have 8gigs of unnecessary voice rendering in French and German downloaded?\n__________\n\nI am 52, I've been gaming since 1984.   I've gone through a lot, but always within the Sci-Fi / Fantasy RPG or FPS genre.   I love Star Wars titles, especially those where you get to play out the storyline as a character.  My favorite game is a little known title for the Atari ST (The first 1 megabyte system... boy have we come a long way) called "Captive"\n\nBut after 30 years.... this.... FIASCO... of a game plan.\n\nRight now STEAM shows that I have played 6 hours of this game.  That is a lie.  A Bold faced lie.   What I have done is waited and waited and waited for the opportunity to play.... without the actual ability to do so.   I bought this game THREE FULL DAYS AGO  (capital letters for stress, not to shout)  and as of yet, I haven't played one minute.\n\n\n\nSTEP ONE:  purchase the game.\n\n\n\nIt's on sale.  I have the money.  I loved Oblivion and Skyrim (still play both) so why not grab Tamriel Online?  Start to finish it only takes less than 5 minutes for me to purchase the game.  I buy Portal 2 with it (for a slight discount) and set about downloading both.\n\n\n\nSTEP TWO: Download the game.\n\n\n\nI have a new computer.  I only bought it 2 weeks ago.  It has 8g of RAM, it has another 4g of RAM on the video card.  It has a 1T Hard Drive.  It's souped up and ready to rock.   It's running WIN10 which I don't care for.  (This system is too intrusive and invasive.  It steals infomration rather than asking for it..... such as how I found the passwords from my Father-in-laws network in the Wi-Fi connections.... and he lives 400 miles from here!!!!!  WIN10 grabbed the info from my cellphone without my permission.)\n\nAnyway --- rocking system, I'm running both Wi-Fi and dial-up on it.  I start Download and then learn that this game has 56GIGS of information to download.\n\nTurn off monitor, go to bed, wake up next morning.   12% done... needs another 22 hours.\n\nTWENTY TWO HOURS.... for downloading a game.  I could do it faster if I had DVDs to swap!!!!!!\n\n\nSTEP THREE: the waiting\n\n\nOK it wants 22 hours to download, I will give it that.  I leave my computer on for the next full day and get myself busy elsewhere.... occassionally checking in to see how progress is going.   All in all it takes nearly 34 hours start to finish to download the game.  I even tried switching my access port to North Korea figuring the Communists probably don't have many gamers downloading over-bloated game content.\n\nI spent 7 years playing the original Guild Wars.   Great game... wonderful game... I still have all the Content Discs and all the expansions.    Last time I loaded it up... it took only 3 hours start to finish.  That was something like 14 CD swaps to load.\n\n34 hours...... and I haven't played the game yet.\n\n\nSTEP FOUR: The hidden traps.\n\n\nOK, OK, OK, I have finally gotten the game installed.  I anxiously click on PLAY --- the intro screen graphics are amazing!!!!   PLAY...... and..... start downloading patches and updates.\n\nWHAT!!!!!\n\n\nFor the next SIX HOURS -----  SIX STRAIGHT HOURS  ------- I watch as my system continues to download this memory hog.  At one point, after hours of waiting, I am at 99% after a few hours of getting there... I am literally drooling to get into this game.... I watch as it clicks from 99%..... to the next patch.  It took 2 hours to download one patch / update.\n\nI'm now beginning to wonder if ANYONE has ever played this game.\n\nAnyway.... six hours of waiting.... all patches downloaded... I finally get to click on PLAY (and really hopefully get to play this time....) It's nearly midnight on the 2nd day after I bought this game.....\n\nI click play.....\n\nYou have to set up an account with Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited.\n\nWHAT!?!?!?   You mean you couldn't have told  me this FIRST while I was waiting for the stupid patches to download?!?!?!?\n\nOk, Ok, Ok, how long can this take?\n\n\nSTEP FIVE:  Insanity upon Insanity\n\n\n\nOK, so I am directed over to ESO's website.  I set up an account.  My name "BethelAbba" Isn't taken (rarely is... it's a Hebrew phrase) I set up a password.  Go to Email ---- Find new Verification Email --- click on Verify.   Account Verified...\n\nGo back to STEAM..... click PLAY....  Enter account name & password.\n\nAccount not recognized.\n\nGive me a break!!!!!!\n\nI assume that SOMEHOW I managed to screw my password up.   Not usual, but it does happen.  I go over to ESO website, click out of my account, click to sign back in... and tell it I forgot my password.   Go to Email ---- find Password Reset Email ---- Click on link....... reset password.\n\nGo Back to STEAM (see a pattern here?)..... click PLAY....  Enter account name & password.\n\nAccount not recognized.\n\nNo kidding.  No fooling.  No FREAKIN' WAY!!!\n\nI go back to ESO.... I review my account page thoroughly.  That's when I find out that I have to "Choose an account option" --- do I want to pay through the nose monthly to play a game I already paid good money for?  (Thank you Blizzard for this STUPID method of extracting more money from gamers.  It's precisely why I will never buy another Blizzard game as long as I live.)\n\nOk. Ok. Ok.

It's either "an amazing game" or "a terrible game, not like Skyrim at all". And I think that those who dislikes the game was looking for Skyrim with friends, something that this game would never be (they said from the start that it was going to be an MMO, and that exactly what they gave us). The ones that like the game was looking for an MMO, and this game is a unique type of MMO.\nI hear people say that this isn't Skyrim online, I'm here to tell you that they are right. It's so much more!\nThis game has the gates of Oblivion with the Sigil Stones ans Scamps that follows with it, Ayleid Ruins with traps and Welkynd Stones and the Shivering Isles with Haskill and Sheogorath. If you ever played Oblivion, then this game holds a bunch of nostalgia for you. I couldn't stop laughing when I fist saw Haskill, all I could think about was the Summon Haskill spell you get from the Shivering Isles quest line in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.\nThis game also contains the Dwemer Ruins with the Dwarven Spiders and the Dwarven Spheres, the old dragon burial mounds and the Nordic Ruins with Draugrs and puzzles. Almost everything you can do in The Elders Scrolls V: Skyrim, you can do in this game. And you can do a whole lot that you can't do in Skyrim.\nThis game has content from all of the Elder Scrolls games, but I have only played Oblivion and Skyrim so that's all I know :P\nIf you are looking for Skyrim online, you're not going to find it here. But if you are looking for a unique MMO, with content from all the Elder Scrolls games and endless possibilities in character builds and playing styles, this is the game for you!\n\nHope this helped, see you in Tamriel :)","February 1","true","118.3"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","27","37","2","2"

The combat and progression is less exciting than its Elder Scrolls cousins, almost to the point of being watered down. Yet the multiplayer aspect of this game is not as convenient as other games: few dungeons, no auction house and difficult player interaction. This game was infamous for bugs at launch, not all of them have been resolved.\n\nPros:\nThis being said, this marriage can be justified by a few unique features. This game is well written, voice acted, and the setting is fully fleshed out, large and glorious. At times, it gives uncanny flashbacks to its Elder Scrolls cousins, while being able to be enjoyed with a friend or two. Over all, a worthwhile experience -- regardless of its flaws.\n\nCons:\nWhy do I not recommend it? The pay model is absolute garbage. All the endgame material (PvP and PvE) is blocked off by a series of pay walls: expansion packs. This DLC is released every quarter of the year, 20 bucks a pop : 80 bucks/year. Subbing unlocks content temporarily: 120 bucks/year. Keep in mind that you cannot buy the expansions directly, you have to buy Crowns -- which are only sold in 10$, 18$, 30$. This means that you will end up over-paying for your expansions by going through their stupid system. This is a paid game, you already paid full price (40~80$) for it -- and yet have content held hostage by an expensive and badly optimized system.\n\nVerdict:\nIf you love the world of ES, you will enjoy ESO as a co-op watered-down game. If you are looking for an good MMO, this is not it.","May 25","false","82.2"," 118 of 199 people (59%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","59","118","199","14","11"

This game is incomplete. Bethesda is one of the greatest gaming companies out there and have come out with some serious hits. Furthermore, The Elder Scrolls is one of my favorite franchises of all time. That's why I had to give this game a fair chance. Since this is a negative review, I'll start with the positive. The lore is fantastic. Every quest you do is unique and fun, and it doesn't ever really start to feel grindy. The game's story is fully immersive, and lives up to the expectations that players would have of the title. I credit a large part of this to the five-star voice acting. Next, the action combat system is above average. It's fun enough that a mere four classes is more than enough to have lots of different specs and fulfill any role in the typical rpg trinity (tank, healer, dps). Rolling around like a ninja on your nightblade, or standing in the fray and blasting your enemies with fire as a Dragonknight, the game exceeds in entertaining the typical nerd's thirst for role play. And lastly, the pvp of the game is wonderful. Despite the quests being so good, pvp is where the real fun began. Building siege weapons and tearing down castles with hundreds of other players truly gave me the full sensation of a raid.\n\nNow here's where the game fails miserably: it is full, and I really do mean full, of bugs. Whoever they hired to do the programming must have gone to DeVry or something, because every little step you take in the game has a bug. Whether the game lags terribly, crashes suddenly, or leaves you in the dreaded perpetual loading screen, it happens all too frequently. Now, even the very best games have programming errors. But when it's this noticeable, you have to ask yourself whether the people who made the game even cared, or whether they just half-♥♥♥♥♥ it in order to rake in our cash. Either way, it makes the game incredibly frustrating, and nearly unplayable. For a $50 game that is supposed to be the end of an era of arguably the best videogame series EVER, this is just unacceptable. And for that reason, I cannot in all good conscious recommend it.\n\nA very regrettable thumbs down. :(","December 28, 2015","false","155.5"," 96 of 160 people (60%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","60","96","160","17","7"

Mostly because of the infinite loading screen bug that leave my game unplayable until I got help from the support.\nWhat really give me a good impression is, so far, Zenimax is one of the rare game studios that bother making a phone call ways from the US to Vietnam to help me out. For email support, it only take less than 1 hour to get their reply. I used to deal with Steam before to solve some account hacking problem in the past, it took them 1 month to reply my support request. I really appreciate Zenimax's support team (and btw they even get into my Twitter account to remind me not to give my account to anyone else, because it's against TOS, kinda prove me that they cares). But it's okay.\n\nBack to the game, comparing to most MMOs I had played so far (Guild Wars 2, DCUO, Perfect World, Champions Online, Tera,...) this game packs ALOT of action, exploring is satisfying, the graphic is great, for a MMO standard.\nThe game's community seems to be quite friendly and helping, but when it comes to Dungeon, it will take you a lot of time to find a decent party, since most people in higher are scattered everywhere and no one ever use the LFG system (it never work anyway).\n\nThe gameplay itself, it feels like an Elder Scrolls game, but it's not exactly as good as Skyrim, to be honest. As the game become Buy-to-play, If you're a fan of Elder Scrolls franchise, or is looking for a new MMO to play, I really recommend this game (but you best to grab it on any possible sales).\nEnglish is not my first language, pardon me for any errors.","March 28, 2015","true","96.8"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","19","23","0","0"

I played the game during beta/Open beta and came to the conclusion that while it was an okay game it was not good enough to warrant a subscription fee.  Then there was all the stuff they ended up doing with the Imperial Edition that just sealed the deal for me.  Now that they've dropped the sub and the reviews seem to be mostly positive I decided to go ahead and give this a try.\n\nI must admit so far things seem pretty good.  I've played a little over 40 hours, I'm up to level 18 now and my sorcerer is starting to fill out nicely.  I recall in the beta I had issues with how fast mana would deplete leaving you with only basic attacks.  I don't really feel that is an issue anymore, you can't just cast forever but it's balanced enough so that I feel like I get to use my spells when I want/need to and any drain could easily be bolstered with a quick potion to finish out the encounter.  I haven't played much of the other classes but I created a Templar and two-handed weapons still need some work.  The slow, unresponsivness of two-handed weapons was another gripe of mine in beta and while they have made changes to it, it still feels sluggish to me.  Example, with the mage the variation of light, medium and heavy basic attacks are very clear and visually easy to discern, using two handed it seems much harder not only to execute but to tell when it's happening.  That said I have heard they are already in the midst of re-tooling two-handed weapon combat.\n\nThe pacing of leveling in ESO takes some getting used to, in the time it's taken me to get to 18 in ESO I'd probably be 40+ easily in a game like Neverwinter (another game I play occassionaly).  The good thing about their system though is you always feel like you're getting better, no level for me to this point has felt wasted.  Every skill point has been a decision of where to invest to get the most out of my class/playstyle.  I guess you could say the progression is slower but more impactful.\n\nQuesting is a fairly standard trope, which isn't to say it's bad but it's nothing outside of what you come to expect for any MMO.  There haven't been any quests that have blown me away or had me thinking, "Man that was awesome!"  Now that said I'm not saying the questing is bad or boring.  To be honest the quests are quite well written and often times some of them are good for a laugh.  Most of the voice acting is very well done which serves to not detract from the experience.  I recommend actually listening to the stories and quest diaglogue as it makes questing feel like more than just going from place to place and doing mundane tasks.  All the quests, even ones where you're just killing stuff are wrapped up in a story line of some kind.  ESO probably does one of the better jobs of any MMO to make the stuff you're killing seem relevant to the story surrounding it.  When you strip it all away any most MMO questing always boils down to go here do this and go here kill that and ESO is the same but if you actually listen to the story you won't really ever notice it.  I have yet to think to myself, "Man I'm sick of these kill quests."  Something I did run into in most MMOs I've played.\n\nAs I said I'm only a bit over 40 hours in so far so haven't even scratched the surface really but so far I'm not regretting trying this out.  I had said I was going to wait for a sale but I was bored and went ahead and paid th $60 I'm glad it turned out okay.\n\nI haven't had a chance to try out PvP yet, I like PvP but mostly as a side affair for when I need a change.  I also have not done much grouping or group content.  I tried to do the first dungeon but was unable to find a group.  Grouping in general though is still poor in this game compared to almost any other MMO you can think of in recent memory.  I still do not understand how you design an online game of this nature and have the grouping limitations they had at launch and while they have made improvements it's still a negative to me.\n\nPersonally I don't care much for the way they handle mounts as it relates to their pricing in the Crown store.  Different mounts have different prices, which is fine but the thing is in ESO all mounts are equal.  In most MMOs you generally have different tiers of mounts and the price is usually based on that tier and then also on the "cool factor" of the mount.  Well in ESO it's solely based on the "cool factor" so to speak.  Problem is Zenimax determines that; right now there is a horse mount with flaming eyes, nostrils and feet.  Cool mount I believe it costs 2500 crowns, another mount is the Guar, it's a two legged little reptilian like thing.  Not as flashy as the horse I guess you could say be it's also a cool mount, it only costs 1300 crowns.  Now if I happen to think the guar is the more cool of those two mounts I just got the coolest mount and saved myself 1200 crowns over the other guy who thought the horse was better but we both get the exact same in-game benefit.  So basically you're paying extra crowns just based off the arbitrary decisions of whoever sets these crown store prices that thought the horse was more cool than the guar so there for it should cost more crowns.  Even though game play wise they are identical.  That is a poor system to me.\n\nOne last thing I'll say is that the free to play model for this game is pretty fair, so far as that goes anyway.  The prices in the store aren't too over-priced and at least so far it doesn't feel like you're being nickel and dimed for everything.  The store is pretty new though so it doesn't have a whole lot in it yet.  I actually think the Premium sub is the biggest waste of money right now.  So far as I can tell the only real tangible benefit is the +10% xp gain but that's hardly worth $15 a month.  As of this review I don't believe there are any DLC or game packs so that part of it doesn't even factor in and the 1500 crown points, while nice, again not something I would sub for when you could just buy them as needed.  So yeah, if actually getting people to sub is a thing they would like they really need to make that more enticing.  I mean it's a good thing the free model is strong, where you don't feel like you HAVE to sub but for those willing to sub you should give them bonuses that are actually worth that monthly commitment.","April 15, 2015","true","224.0"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","24","32","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kronuxx/recommended/306130/","Kronuxx","Kronuxx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kronuxx/","132 products in account","An Overview on what ESO is truly about:\n\nLet me start off by saying, that yes ESO does have its flaws, such as difficulty partying with another player at times (not always though), but in the grand overlay of all the other MMO's that are out there, ESO does something unique.\n\nIt combines an aesthetic world (which by the way can be improved with mods, yes you heard it here) with a great musical score, and years worth of intriguing lore. In addition, while not for all people, its combat is unique and offers a fresh perspective compared to the age-old horrible standard of tab targeting combat.  You know, the combat where you hit tab for your target, then push one hotkey that auto-spams (auto attack) itself until you decided to hit a different hotkey.  I always felt that this type of combat, was non-engaging and quite monotonous. Might as well as grab some popcorn and watch your character attack as if you're watching a movie.\n\nIn ESO, it's combat is action based, where I defend and attack based on my will alone. Akin to Skyrim, in the sense that I attack when I click the mouse button, I block as well when I want to block, and I even get to dodge when I want to dodge. And my attack doesn't register unless that person is in front of me. Granted, yes ESO does have hotkeys for those unique abilities, but in combination with its action based combat it offers a fresh perspective on combat in the MMO world. And honestly, I prefer this mode of combat. Not to mention I can do this while in first person (although probably not the best perspective while PvPing). In any game, whether it's a MMO, RPG, FPS, etc., you spend most of your playtime during combat and combat mechanics are very important. Some argue that ESO's movement in combat is a little clunky, but they have released patches to increase its fluid motion. I guess this a matter of opinion, but in my eyes it looks good to me.\n\nNow on the topic of ESO requiring a sub fee. Here's how I logistically think about subscription based vs. F2P. Yes F2P is nice, in the sense, that well...that game is free. Yet, when a game is F2P, that company needs to make money somehow. So how do they do it? By putting items up on the market that you buy. Now I'm not going to argue about whether this type of method creates a pay-to-win environment, but I will say this. Once they have your money, what's the incentive to keep you? You're not a subscriber, you're not dedicated to them, so why should they obligate themselves to ensure they release a patch on time, or have friendly on-time customer service, or do anything else for that matter to keep you. The answer is they don't have to, because once they have your money, that's it. They can move on and try to entice the next free-playing gamer to give up his/her money. You aren't subscribed to them, so in their eyes, you are not a guaranteed customer. You see, when you make a game for free, it opens the door for more people to try. With more people willing to try the game because there are no repercussions (in this case loss of money), it is much easier for that developer to lose that customer since there will likely be thousands more taking his/her place in playing their free game. Thus a thousand more opportunities to have that player pay for some item in the in-game market. You could decide to give them money one day and the other day decide to leave. Some may say that this is why F2P is better because they then try to produce content to keep you from leaving, but you have to remember that this only shows that money is an end to their means. Meaning, whatever ends are placed in the game, are only placed as a means to get your money, and this is because you are not dedicated to them through a subscription, thus they don't need to be dedicated to you. The focus in this scenario, soon becomes on how to make money off of the player.\n\nOn the other hand, with a subscription based model, the developer has an incentive/an obligation to keep you. Of course it's because of money, but what company doesn't want money. They need to make a living too. Rather, the point is, that money in this case is a means to an end rather than an end like in the F2P model. Why? Because they need to keep you to continue to subscribe. How? By appeasing/listening to the subscriber through producing content on a frequent basis, solving game bugs, releasing frequent patches, etc. And it can take time for some of these things, albeit sometimes longer than necessary, but more often than not, they are done in a timely fashion. So money is a means to an end to keep the gamer subscribing to their game so that yes, they make more money, but only so they can produce more and better content to keep the subscribed gamer happy and thus continue to receive their subscription. It's almost like you the gamer, share stock in this company that you are paying a monthly fee to. As a stockholder, you contribute to the improvement of this game, in this case I'm obviously talking about ESO.\n\nFinally, I'd like to comment on the horrible publicity this game received prior to its release. Sometimes the gaming community can make or break a game, especially when a "mob mentality" is created within said gaming community.  In this case, ESO had already been pigeon-holed into essentially two categories.  Either it should play and feel similar to a RPG TES game like Skyrim since it had the branding of TES on it, or it should have the vibe and feel of an MMO.  During beta, and even upon release people had been complaining that it wasn't like Skyrim with a multiplayer option, and yet it didn't feel like a true MMO (on some accounts this is the fault of ESO since grouping with others was initially difficult). But ESO has come a long way from its release with many patches addressing its previous faults, and many more to come of course adding new features, like the justice system. In addition, the bad publicity which seemed to be secondary to the initial toxicity of the gaming community, had turned potential players away from even considering this unique gaming experience.  Unique because it's not like Skyrim, and yet it's not like an MMO and that's what I think is so great about it. It's part single player, and part MMO. For some this may not fly, but for others, this may be exactly what they are looking for.\n\nIn short, would I recommend this game to any player? As a gamer, to another gamer, I do recommend you try this game out. Although it may not appeal to all gamers, but rather to the one who enjoys an engrossing storyline and lore, decent action based combat, and not to mention a mature community.  You have a 30-day free trial (at least through steam I know this) so why not?","August 16, 2014","true","68.4"," 260 of 453 people (57%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","57","260","453","8","5"

The possibilities are endless; there are so many different builds and skill combinations that the game truly allows you to be whatever you want. I have made a mage with a greatsword, an assassin with a bow, and even a warrior with a staff. Each time, the result has been completely original. On top of that, there's just SO MUCH TO DO! The quests are a tad bit cliche, but I doubt you could think up 1000+ different side quests, all original, unique, and interesting as the last. But nay, not even the side quests make up the bulk of what there is to do in this game. Different professions, such as blacksmithing and woodworking, take time to improve and have massive benefit. Achievement hunting requires determination, leveling requires patience, questing requires curiosity. But even after that, there's MORE! Dungeons scattered around the map, chests hidden in different locations, and PEOPLE everywhere!\n\nLet me put this straight; if you come to this game because you want some sort of co-op Skyrim, you should leave... now. This game is not that.\n\nAnyways, PEOPLE! I mentioned before how I've hosted a naked dance party in the center of town. All I REALLY did was take my clothes off, start dancing, and then go pee irl. When I came back, there were 15 people around me, dancing naked, and a few people playing the drums and the lute in front of me. People play this game to have fun, and that makes the game fun.\n\nUnfortunately, there are quite a few minor glitches and bugs in this game. These range from the running animation being played when I am on a horse (which is quite funny, because I am running on the back of my mount), the riding animation when I am running (just my torso is seen above the floor... also quite funny), I get stuck inside of a rock, hits don't register (though the most annoying, I only notice this in PvE, so not too bad), etc. Of course, nothing game breaking.\n\nPros:\nINSANE customization ability\nBuy to play, not pay to play\nNo game-breaking items for real money\nNo major glitches that I've ever noticed\nThe game is beautiful\nTHE SOUNDTRACK HOLY BUTTCHEEK\nLots of content\nIT'S an MMO\nPvP is very good, and Cyrodil has loads of content\n\nCons:\nGraphics aren't as good as Skyrim's... I mean, how hard could it have been for them to just turn up saturation, brightness, and contrast just a bit?\nQuite a few bugs here and there\nGrinding is by far the best way to get EXP\nSome quests are cliche\nSo much customization, new players will have a tough time knowing what to do (after 120 hours, I recently figured out what class and build I want to play... I am currently making a new character.)\nImperial race (requires extra purchase) is often considered the best race for tanks\nNot a pick-up and play game; requires time to get decent at it\n\nOther than that, I really do think this game is great. It's definitely the best MMO I've ever played.\n\nTL;DR The game is great, but not just some sort of co-op/MMO Skyrim; it's much more.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nWhy do scuba divers fall backwards off the boat?\n.\n.\n.\nBecause if they fell forward, they would still be on the boat!","April 10","true","242.4"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","20","25","5","0"

However, ever sine update six half a year back, ESO has become the classic Elder Scrolls game you want - but even better!\n\nThe combat system has to be the best combat from any game. You feel like you are taking that swing or blow - it's similar to Skyrim combat but with more features and options to strike your enemy down.\n\nAlso, you DON'T need to start off with a friend to enjoy this game. I didn't, yet I'm getting everything out of this game. The community is brilliant and many people are ready to help. This game is playable solo until after level 50, which is a LOT of gametime. However, it's very easy to join guilds and make new friends to aid you in your future adventures - especially in Cyrodiil - when you've reached that level of difficulty.\n\nThis game is huge. Each zone is about the size of Skyrim (there are 4 zones) yet half of Tamriel hasn't even been added yet. As an MMO, this game will continue to expand and the rest of Tamriel will be included, meaning that the hours and hours of fun gameplay shall constantly be expanding. The graphics are brilliant. Not Skyrim brilliant, but beats-most-games brilliant.\n\nThe combat system, champion system and thieving system are all brilliant. The Thieves Guild is about to be introduced and later on the Dark Brotherhood alongside a lot of DLC's (3 DLC already exist). All to come, all to enjoy. Recommended :)\n\nWhy did I write this?

I have been an Elder Scrolls fan for about 3 years. I played Skyrim on the PS3 and on Steam. I found that Skyrim was probably the best game that existed at the time, until I heard of the Elder Scrolls Online. I got so  hyped for the game. I didn't by any extra packages though. In my mind, the thought of having an Elder Scolls game in a MMO made me so excited. As soon as it arrived on Steam, I bought the game. The fact the the game came with 30 Free Days and that it was half off was an irresistable deal. I downloaded it and began to play. What I found made my eyes bleed.\n\nFrom the start, the game seemed good. It was beautiful. Then I went to recieve my first quest. The new UI was very unlikeable. The new format was terrible, and the fact that there is always a Goodbye text as an option at every discussion gets a bit annoying.\n\nThen as soon as I level up, I want to increase my character's atribute points. The new skill system is very unlikeable. I just doesn't have a Elder Scrolls feeling.\n\nNext thing to talk about is the quests. This quests are so quick and the payout is terrible. Monsters drop 1 coin and Bosses drop two. The payouts for a quest is usually 170 coins. The costs of a Low Grade Bow is about 450. Not worth it.\n\nI could go on for hours listing what is wrong with this game. In general, the main reason why nobody likes this game is because it doesn't feel like an Elder Scrolls game. It's as if someone beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of Skyrim, ripped it apart, and tryed to reassemble it with 5 of the inital 1000 pieces, improvising for the lost 950 pieces.\n\nIt's dissapointing.","July 22, 2014","false","8.8"," 232 of 408 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","232","408","5","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Asvarduil/recommended/306130/","Asvarduil","Asvarduil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Asvarduil/","46 products in account","Once upon a time, there was a prisoner who was arrested for jaywalking in the Imperial City.  What they were not told was that the crime was eternal enslavement to a Daedric Prince, Molag Bal, the Lord of Domination.  What Molag Bal's cultists weren't told, was that that was the worst idea ever.\n\nTESO is an MMORPG that is rather unique in my experience.  First, it's largely an action-MMORPG, in keeping with its single-player heritage.  Similarly the game is featured around exploration; Tamriel is a vast, vast land, there are many skills, there are things you need to find in order to gain more skills called 'Skyshards'.  The land is plastered in undead, doomsday cultists, and bandits.  Quests are everywhere, with some forgettable writing, but in keeping with the core games, who cares?\n\nYou're here to do your own thing.  The skill line system is the most interesting part of this game.  You can truly customize your character's mechanics as you see fit.  The customization systems (dying armor) are very well-thought.\n\nHowever, there are drawbacks to this game.  The elephant in the room is, this game is an MMORPG, not a western RPG for a single player.  Some key parts of the standard Elder Scrolls experience were exchanged for game balance when you get hundreds of humans all mucking with the land and each other.  While some heartily dislike these changes and are convinced this game is the anti-Kynareth, I approached this game with an open mind, and was largely rewarded well for my equanimity.  That said, it's not perfect.\n\nYou can't be truly everything at any time; there are four character classes that you start with that give you some basic skills to draw from, and these create some rather interesting limits.  In my experience so far the Templar is practically a gamebreaker, because it can heal, tank or be reliable melee or ranged DPS, and a lot of the most powerful builds are based on Templar.\n\nWhat's more there are some other balance issues.  As of this writing, light armor is the best armor school to focus on as it gives you benefits way beyond medium and heavy armor.  If you're going to PvP, you'll either want to be a Vampire, which grants some rather broken abilities...or create a build specifically to kill vampires. The Werewolf line is also seriously underpowered; the recent 1.5 patch has slightly buffed werewolves, but the problem is that werewolves need to travel in a pack to be even the slightest bit effective.\n\nThe PvP is another area that's interesting.  At present there are 100v100v100 wars in Cyrodiil, which has all sorts of top-level materials lying around...if you can survive.  However, the size in and of itself is a problem - it takes forever to get anywhere.  What's worse, the PvP experience isn't friendly to new players at all.  This isn't WoW where you can start PvPing in a meaningful capacity at Lv.10; you need to be at least Veteran Rk. I, with a well-planned mount and a healthy dose of paranoia.\n\nThe PvE experience is generally pretty good, and a saving grace of the game.  There are three dungeons in every 'tier' of your pre-VR1 experience, and these dungeons all culminate in questlines that grant Skill Points!  The main story quests grant Skill Points.  The 'tier' of your faction questlines have segments that grant Skill Points.\n\nPROS\nIf you like exploration, hoo boy...you're not going to have much of a life after this.\nGreat action-oriented combat system\nSuperior customization of play style, and even what your armor looks like.\nGood voice acting (Particularly Sheogorath.)\nBeautiful, if somewhat repetitive music.\nPossibly huge PvP battles in Cyrodiil\nGreat PvE experience at any level, whether you care about that or not.\nAmazingly flexible crafting system\nReasonably frequent updates to the game.\nI haven't seen a gold spammer since I started playing this game!  It's awesome!\nCONS\nThe writing is mediocre and forgettable.  Individual quests are worth remembering for their rewards, not so much their challenges or raisons d'etre.\nThe writing tries too hard to be like a core Elder Scrolls game, often forgetting that there are many 'Chosen Ones' running around, instead of embracing that a lot of people have jailbroken Coldharbour, only without their souls.\nThe PvP system is only fun if you can get into a large-scale battle; there is no small-scale, 'quick' PvP.\nSpeaking of, there is hideous skill line imbalances throughout the game as far as PvP is concerned.  These aren't such an issue in PvE.\nThe size of the world starting on your second tier makes a mount a necessity.  However...good luck saving up the first 17,200 Gold.\nThe inventory system in Elder Scrolls game is a recurring joke, and this game is no better.\nUnlike the core series you can't be anything you want at any time.  There is a class system, and a way to pay gold for respecs.\nVerdict: This game is worth your time, if you're up to the task of being open-minded about a rather unorthodox, but rewarding experience.  If you're a PvP gamer, you will need to find a large guild to fight in Cyrodiil with.  If you're not, you still have superior gameplay, albeit with a rather poorly thought-out story.  Of course, story has never been Bethesda's strong point, world building has.  This game is yet another notch in their belt towards a great, explorable world.\n\nThis game is worth $15/month, and as time goes on, it will only get better.\n\n[8 Nov 2014] Edited review to take into account some slight buffs to Werewolf, did some formatting, added as a PRO the crafting system, which I really enjoy.","October 26, 2014","true","376.9"," 227 of 400 people (57%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","57","227","400","13","2"

On multiple occasions I've found myself just sitting and enjoying the environment.\n-Crafting. Love the crafting, multiple styles, various traits, enchantment!\n-Very Large world to explore.

Numerous side quests to are fairly rewarding.\n-Character creation is pretty in depth. I'm happy that they didn't give players too much freedom. It ruins the immersion when a 9-ft tall Wood elf with an abnormally large head runs by.\n-Guilds. With the potential to be in up to 5 guilds gives you great options for socializing and other fun stuff.\n\nCons\n-Mounts are bit tedious. After saving for a week and dropping 10K (which is quite a bit for low levels) you can get the starting mount only to find it isn't any faster than you are. (That is what is feels to me) It's more convenient to just buy some in-game currency and buy a mount to begin with.\n-Side Quests, although numerous can sometimes be pretty repetitive. Notice that nearly every area in each faction has a town in peril and you need to put out fires using a water bucket and save villagers. (But, I'm willing to save as many villages as needed if there is an reward at stake)\n-Voice acting. A bit dull in some cases, not to mention you can hear the same voice actor over and over again.\n\nThere are other things I haven't experienced yet in the game such as alliance war and grouping for dungeons.\n\nThe game is solid.

The bad news is that it has the same pointless grind-for-gear feel that so many MMOs suffer from. Levelling becomes excruciatingly slow and boring and after a while you wonder why you'd even bother. I don't play games that feel like a second job. If I wanted a second job I'd get one. I want fun. This game can be fun - but just getting to max level is a pain and besides looking for better loot it really feels like the game goes nowhere.\n\nThe PvP warzone is kind of fun - but it's so chaotic and you spend most of your time just getting shot in the back. It doesn't feel very skillful and quickly burned out for me. Maybe if I had done more large scale raiding or something but ultimately I just didn't see what made me want to play this MMO over any others.\n\nThe truth is - this is a solid game but it's just like all the other grind for gear MMOs out there with labour intensive quests that are repetitive and don't feel like fun. I personally prefer a game like ArcheAge simply for all the crazy stuff you can do - like get killed and robbed. Newbs may not like it - but at least there are other things to do than wander around collecting bug sacs.\n\nDon't get caught in the grind.

After release of latest "The Elder Scrolls Online" i knew something is different. First of all, it became an MMO with consistent and ever changing world even more alive than before. That's a good thing but they also introduced the monthly subscription. You could not buy the game and enjoy it for ages, you had to pay for every month being in Tamriel (yes, the whole Tamriel, huge continent with all regions from the previous titles). Many players were complaining and i was refusing to even try it. After little more than a year my lost hope and lost love is back again. Zenimax and Bethesda presented Elder Scrolls Online - Unlimited edition with all that amazing stuff available withouth monthly subscription, until now they released 6 major updates that improves almost every aspect of the game. Trust me guys the price of 55eur is nothing compared what this game can offer.\n\nAs a sidenote, all races are split in 3 different factions and each faction have it's own starting area and different story main quest. Crafting looks complicated in begining but you will understand it really fast if you give it a try. There is Enchanting, Blacksmithing, Woodworking, Clothing, Alchemy and Provisioning. Every type of crafting have it's own skill line so you should level up only what you really need if you don't wanna miss combat skills. Every weapon and armour, beside enchantment, can have an extra trait that will buff your character so with all of that crafting becomes really important part of the game.\n\nI could spend few hours writing about every aspect of the game so if you have some extra cash and a lot of free time to spare, buy it and try it.

And I think that those who dislikes the game was looking for Skyrim with friends, something that this game would never be (they said from the start that it was going to ba an MMO, and that exactly what they gave us). The ones that like the game was looking for an MMO, and this game is a unique type of MMO.\nI hear people say that this isn't Skyrim online, I'm here to tell you that they are right. It's so much more!\nThis game has the gates of Oblivion with the Sigil Stones ans Scamps that follows with it, Ayleid Ruins with traps and Welkynd Stones and the Shivering Isles with Haskill and Sheogorath. If you ever played Oblivion, then this game holds a bunch of nostalgia for you. I couldn't stop laughing when I fist saw Haskill, all I could think about was the Summon Haskill spell you get from the Shivering Isles quest line in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.\nThis game also contains the Dwemer Ruins with the Dwarven Spiders and the Dwarven Spheres, the old dragon burial mounds and the Nordic Ruins with Draugrs and puzzles. Almost everything you can do in The Elders Scrolls V: Skyrim, you can do in this game. And you can do a whole lot that you can't do in Skyrim.\nThis game has content from all of the Elder Scrolls games, but I have only played Oblivion and Skyrim so that's all I know :P\nIf you are looking for Skyrim online, you're not going to find it here. But if you are looking for a unique MMO, with content from all the Elder Scrolls games and endless possibilities in character builds and playing styles, this is the game for you!\nIn my opinion, this game is better than Skyrim.\nThis game is AMAZING!","March 26, 2015","true","81.3"," 25 of 36 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","25","36","0","2"

The crafting system is something I think all MMO's could learn from.\n\nFor those expecting Skyrim with friends... Its not that. As a matter of fact I would say that, besides the setting, this game has more in common with Fable than Elder Scrolls. There's even a quest which features the voice actor of the Fable Guildmaster that has a jab at how he was handled in Fable. Thar archery system in this is handled nearly identically to the bows in Fable as well.\n\nOn its own its a decent MMO with an incredible player driven PVP battlefield. Players can erect siege engines, destroy towers and buildings. I havent spent enough time in the PVP yet but what I did spend was mindblowing. We tried to take over a farm from the aldmeri dominion with a small strike force and one catapult. We nearly succeeded too, but the enemy got reinforced and we had to pull out. Its a weird cross between planetside and a typical MMO in the PVP.\n\nSo far, beyond a couple outliers, the fetch quests have been well explained and voiced, making it feel like I'm not just grabbing 8 macguffins for my next level. The combat is very active and I have found I cannot dual screen like I can in Quickbar based MMOs. I need to be focused in combat or else I will die, which is a refreshing change.\n\nThe quick travel in this is just explained by "MAGIC" and you can either use a wayshrine to travel for free or use a small amount of gold if you cant reach a shrine safely. I find the teleport much nicer than watching my character go all across the terrain like in other MMOs.\n\nWith the advent of Buy to Play instead of a subscription I imagined they would end up with a SWTOR like second and third class citizen model, where XP is reduced for non subs and you cant do things like dye your armor. THIS IS NOT THE CASE. THERE IS NO SECOND CLASS CITIZENSHIP MODEL IN THIS GAME. If you buy it, you own all of it. No Subscriber only areas, no VIP lounges, just the whole ham MMO. Subscribers will have access to any DLC that drops (That nonsubs can buy), but in my opinion that is absolutely fair.\n\nSo far, I am extremely impressed with this turnaround and hope many of you will play this with me.","March 25, 2015","true","209.3"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","1"

THere's no other way to say it, it just wasnt fun and it didnt feel like a true elder scrolls experience. That said, I would now whole heartedly recommend it. I've been playing about 36 hours since it became Tamreil Unlimited and I absolutely love it.\n\nA few improvements off the top of my head:\nThe combat is more fun.\nThe tutorial sequence has been tweaked to where not only does it explain most of the games mechanics but it's actually engaging,\nJustice system allows for more rogueish gameplay.\nWith the B2P transition the community has expanded, we have more players, offering more advice, and populating the world.\nThe NPCs actually animate while talking. This may not seem like a big deal but for those of us who like to completely immerse ourselves in a game you'll actually care about the characters now.\nThe crown store isnt Pay to Win BS, it's actually fun little cosmetic stuff.\nA few downsides:\nLack of personal instancing can sometimes make the game feel overpopulated. Ancient ruins that havent been touched in decades are full of players tripping over one another and contesting other players for questline boss kills isnt really fun.\nA few technical hiccups, like occsional freezing (not very often), and interior environments loading-in, can be mildly irritating.\nWhile it still doesnt feel like a true succesor to The Elder Scrolls series, I think that's ok. TESO isnt a traditional Elder Scrolls entry, it's an MMO first and you will likely come to terms with that early on. What it does instead (and I think it does this rather well) is intigrate many classic Elder Scrolls mechanics into the MMO atmosphere in a way that is enjoyable.\n\nIf you tried the game in the past and left disappointed I recommend returning and giving it another chance. If you heard some negative reviews and decided against picking it up early after it's release, rest assured, it's a brand new Tamriel waiting to be explored.","March 21, 2015","true","54.6"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

No! Not at all, but be expecting some repitition when questing.\n-Crafting, again I listed as a pro but it has its faults, sometimes gathering materials can be tedious and annoying, hides don't drop everytime, you don't get markers on map or compass for gather mats like Jute, but this is easily fixed by UI Addons but i still have to list it as a con because it should already be in the game\n-Latency, the Mega Server technology is still new so the latency a lot of times (especially peak hours) can severely hurt the gameplay, a lot of people don't have issues a lot do, me i get 50ms in every other online game except this one, so at times fighting mobs can be a pain and PVP is just not fun\n-PVP, you get the option to PVP at LVL 10, now even though theres others who are Veteran Rank 14 you scale up to that rank, so if you're LVL 10 your stats scale up to VR14, simple right? Unfortunately that isn't enough as you are still level 10 so you dont have access to skills a VR1-14 would have, so you can't perform well in combat so it's IMO pointless to PVP at 10, until you can have a full build you are comfortable with I would wait to PVP till 50-VR1\n-Race System, one of the biggest faults is dividing things up into 3 factions to make the game more like an MMO, it sucks if your friends want to be in Ebonheart Pact but you like a race in Daggerfall Covenant, you can't group and so that is not fun, this is solved by getting the Adventure Pack in the Crown store it lets you play any race with any faction and that was a preorder bonus but its still a con because it gets annoying\n-Guild System, the guild system is great you can join 5 guilds but guilds are alliance wide which is again great but like I mentioned you can't group with people in other alliances so why they made guilds alliance wide I'll never understand\n\nAll in all I rate this game a 8/10, go in with the mindset of skyrim online you'll hate this game, but if you love MMO's i would recommend this game, I played it during the closed beta and it sucked they have improved so much in the next year and its nice to see the developers actually making the game better, this game has a bright future ahead and I would recommend you hop in and join us.","March 19, 2015","true","100.2"," 26 of 38 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","26","38","0","0"

It's not for everyone though, especially if you're the kind of guy that wants to race to the top speeding through dungeons and quests in less than 24 hours.

We wanted an Elder Scrolls Game with MMO Elements (AKA Skyrim Online), But instead, they gave us an MMO with Elder Scrolls Elements. People seem to think that just because this isn't Skyrim Online that it is a bad game. Personally, I think it is really enjoyable. I haven't seen too much of the game, but the PvE is fun, but the only real problem I have with the game is the levelling. I don't mean to say it is too hard to gain levels, but the exp should be boosted a small bit for quests so you can actually keep up with the levels, without having to farm enemies until you get a high enough level to continue without being stomped on. In the end, if you want Skyrim Online, don't buy it. It's not what you are going to get.

You need to play it as a combination of the two if you want to fully enjoy the experience.\n\nPros:\n\n-More emphasis on placement and movement than most other MMO's\n-Nostalgic feel traveling through previous zones from Elder Scrolls games\n-Great music\n-Great graphics\n-Great questing experience (plot, NPC dialogue, environments)\n-In-depth crafting system, which is required to make/upgrade some of the best items\n-Healing is not watching health bars, most spells require positioning and resource management\n-Tanking is harder because there are no Area of Effect taunts, all are single target.  You need to prioritize targets because you can't taunt them all most of the time\n-Resource management is important in both PvE and PvP\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n-'Looking For Group' tool is not used by players, and not reliable for finding groups for dungeons.  you must use zone chats or guilds\n-'Damage Per Second' role isn't any different from other MMO's, it's all a skill rotation over and over.\n-Grouping in general is somewhat hard to come by if you are not at end-game content or doing popular content (like dungeons)\n-All magicka spells can be cast while holding block, making them immune to stuns at the cost of losing some stamina.  This is the biggest flaw for PvP\n-PvP can be boring after a short amount of time because there is no clear "winner".  It uses the same model of Planetside 2 (3 alliances, none can be completely eliminated and the real invenctive is to earn points by doing PvP related things).\n\n\nOverall this is my favorite game in years and for now I give it 9/10, but once traditional Elder Scrolls features get added shortly (like Thieve's Guild, Dark Brotherhood, and killing NPCs) it will be at least 9.5/10 or maybe 10/10 for me.","January 2, 2015","true","146.3"," 43 of 69 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","43","69","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/paid_didnt_win/recommended/306130/","paid_didnt_win","Paid_Didn't_Win","http://steamcommunity.com/id/paid_didnt_win/","169 products in account","This game received horrific reviews and impressions when first released, so I steered very, very clear of it until it went "no sub" ...here are my impressions.\n\nFirst off - If you're looking for a MMO, in a World of Warcraft, Wildstar, Tera, etc etc etc sense...  This might not be for you.\n\nThe emphasis certainly seems to be on single player questing.... Think SWTOR.  EVERYTHING is voice acted, and actually voice acted well.  The Elder Scrolls lore is all very rich, very detailed, and very accurate.  If you enjoyed any of the ES titles, you owe it to yourself to give this a whirl, if only for the amazing single player experience.\n\nGroup dynamics, for dungeons and questing...  a little lacking.  While it can be great fun to roll through a dungeon with a few buddies, some times getting a group together using the group finder tool can be quite a task.  Perhaps that is because of low population, but I think it has more to do with the actual group finder tool just not working.  There is another, REAL annoying glitch that can affect your character, because of the Veteran system, essentially forcing you to beg a Veteran Character (level 50, prestiged, basically) to join your group and toggle an option so that you can enter dungeons again.  It's not game-breaking, but it is pretty frustrating when it occurs.  Another rather major issue I have with the Faction system is this.  You are given a choice of 3 Factions to join, each faction has 3 respective races of which they belong.  The problem here is that if your friends want to play, as say a Nord, and you selected a Bosmer.... you will never play with each other on those characters.  Ever.  You can be in the same guild and communicate that way, but other than that, the only opportunity you have to even see eachother will be during PVP.  That's it.  It's a move at bolstering "Faction Pride", I suppose, but all it really does is segregate the player base and further detract from the whole MMO experience.  It is very likely that you are going to want to play a different race than your buddy, for whatever reason  (RP, min/maxing/etc).\n\nI have barely even scratched the surface of PvP, but from what I've seen Cyrodiil looks incredible.  Picture a massive zone that is a microcosm of the game world.  Tons of NPCs giving quests, mission boards of varying types, massive skirmishes,  castle sieges.... Very objective based, not just mindless zerg deathmatch (though that does occur).  You can, in theory, adventure and PVE in the PVP zone and never encounter a single enemy faction player.  First impressions - this area looks like a massive hit, implemented extremely well (what Ashran COULD/SHOULD have been, in WoW).\n\nThe combat gameplay is excellent.  There are no turns, no global cool down per say.  Abilities use Stamina or Magicka, most enemy attacks are telegraphed and therefore require blocking/interrupting/dodging.\n\nThere is a massive amount of character specialization, in that essentially any of the 4 classes (Dragonknight, Templar, Nightblade, Sorceror) can pick and choose any of the available weapons/armours and thus unlock that skill chain.  This amazingly deep system allows you to pick and choose which individual ability to put on your ability bar, allowing for some really cool combinations.  I do have a gripe that you cannot save "loadouts", and have to go through a clunky process of dragging abilities on and off to fit your particular need at the given time.  Skills and Trees level up upon receiving experience, and from being present on your ability bar during exp receival.  All in all, this system is not GROUND-BREAKING per say, but quite refreshing from the standard MMO fare.\n\nGraphics and sound are just incredible.  Period.   If you have the system for it, crank up the draw distance and detail, and just marvel at how beautiful this game looks.  I find myself periodically forgetting whatever quest or objective I have, and just wandering the lands of Tamriel simply because of the incredible ambient sound and amazing attention to detail the landscape shows.  Seriously, if you like a pretty open world environment - this is it.  I question how well the game is optimized, however it still runs well enough that I have no real complaints.  Towns are massive, and I frequently find whenver I need to go to town for various tasks, hours go by without notice.\n\nCrafting in the game is fairly simple, requiring you to obtain raw materials which you then refine at a crafting station and then use those for the creation process.  Deconstructing items that belong to that specific profession is crucial to leveling up your crafting skill, as well as obtaining materials used for certain item traits and characteristics, including improvement.  You also must research traits, in order to unlock the ability to craft an item with that particular attribute.  This requires you finding a weapon/armour piece that belongs to that same family, and then spending a set amount of time (from a few hours all the way up to 32 days, depending how many traits in that family you have already unlocked) which then destroys the item in the process, but unlocks the trait for eternity.\n\nCrafting is actually quite useful for providing upgrades for you, your alts, and your friends.  Also a decent income generator.  Loot is generally pretty random in the game, and if you have luck like mine, you will frequently find that you do not actually find loot for your specific character, but for everyone else, since loot is NOT personalized or tailored to your class/spec.  The upside to this, however, unlike almost every other damned MMO out there, is that almost everything you find, is NOT BIND ON PICKUP!  Incredible, a MMO-ish game that ACTUALLY allows you to trade!  WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT?\n\nNow, before you think this is incredible....the economy part of the game is.... different.  There is no central auction house.  No, in ESO, if you wish to buy/sell to other players you must join guilds.  You are allowed 5 guilds of which to simultaneously be a member of.  Each guild has a max roster of 500 players.  Joining a guild allows you access to a Guild Store, essentially giving you the ability to hawk your items to those 500 players, and browse their respective wares as well.  If you're really lucky, you join a guild that actually has a world store front, which is obtained through a bidding process vs other guilds.  Essentially, this allows players to visit a Trader NPC, located some where in the game world, who then lists your Guild Store auctions not only to your respective guild, but to any player who happens to wander by.  Obviously, the more centralized/busy Trader locations are very highly sought after, thus the amount required to succesfully bid (which lasts a week, I believe) is quite high.  It is an interesting and unique take on a MMO economy, one that many people are not fans of.  ZOS, from what I understand, did not want a system in place that would allow anyone with enough money to simply hit the auction house and kit out their character with little to no effort.  Understandable, but I also feel this was a rather thinly veiled attempt at combating gold farming, and 3rd party sites.  Probably quite effective.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a very rich and deep single player experience that will have you yearning to go back to Skyrim, or for the next Elder Scrolls installment, I would definitely recommend ESO.  The MMO aspect of it is.... thin, but still there.  The story line is well thought out and well written, the voice acting, sound, and graphics are all top notches with a few blips here and there.  Combat is never stale, and certainly not something you can sleep through like other MMOs.\n\nWith regular balance updates and hotfixes being released, I can only hope there is more great stuff to come... like... Player housing?  One can hope.\n\nSolid 8.5/10","April 21, 2015","true","274.9"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

Yes the game itself looks very nice and feels very nice (outside of the very poor optimisation).\n\nOptimisation issues I encountered:\n\nIn the tutorial, I ran the game at ultra high with 100fps. I have a GTX 970 and an 8-core AMD Vishera 4.0(4.2 turbo)ghz processer. After the tutorial, once I got back into Tamriel, I hit 30-40fps. I had to REALLY lower the settings and I still couldnt break 60fps.\n\nMy other issue with this game is that Zenimax is incredibly greedy.\nYou are already spending $40-$80 on the game alone, and then in order to get all the DLC you have to spend another $15 each, and in order to play any race in any pact, you have to spend another $15. You could spend hundreds of dollars to get all the content you want. Hell, Zenimax will sell you anything. You can BUY vampirism or lycanthropy. Thats just a terrible business model right there.\n\nI guess you'd think that a game in this genre (which has largely become free-to-play) would not have this many ridiculously priced microtransactions when you already spend a huge amount to buy the game to begin with. And you\'d also think that a game of this calibur would have better optimisation.\n\nI asked for a refund as well, which will hopefully go through even though I went over the limit of 2-hours because of the ridicuously long patch times the launcher puts you through as well.\n\n\nAs a huge elder scrolls fan, I really wanted to love this game, and love playing it with friends, but I simply cannot when the payment model this game uses is so atrocious.\n\nIf you are okay with this sort of microtransaction abuse, by all means get the game. If you love the Elder Scrolls games and dislike all of these things I have described - long wait times to download patches, expensive microtransactions, poor optimizaiton - I would wait for the next single player Elder Scrolls that is actually made by Bethesda Softworks.","June 1","false","2.9"," 55 of 92 people (60%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","60","55","92","6","20"

The game has a pretty interesting story, entertaining side quests that keep you moving town to town, and a combat system that is a definite step above most ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes, as it is much more focused on strategy over just gearing up. I have been running missions that are most likely too high of a level for my character, yet with enough attempts, and figuring out the right strategy, even lower leveled gear can get the job done. Combat aside, the community is also great. Within these 11 hours, I have been invited to two different "Guilds", where players have been more than helpful in getting me to where I need to go, as well as random players trading me items for no good reason. Not to mention, the global chat is usually well-populated with mature, helpful folks.\n\nIf you're looking for a good MMO, and a good Elder Scrolls experience, get this game. And if you are smart like I was, get it now while the subscription fees are still active. You will get a free 30 days that you can cancel payment for, but once the fees are gone, it will become ESO+, and you'll get some small rewards along with said launch.\n\nGet this game. 10/10.\nEDIT:\nI have put more time into the game, and have more to say. Should have mentioned this prior, but if you have a low-end PC, throwing this game on Minimal should actually make it play very well for you, as it did for me until I changed gfx cards tonight. I am 22 hours in, and still haven't made much progress, which is great. The game is built to have you WANT to explore and take your time, so the amount of time it will take to get to the "end" should be rather high. My only complaint thus far is that I have semi-frequent crashes (perhaps once every few hours) but they are not an issue, as I resume right where I left off.\n\nAt this point, I find it insane I hadn't gotten into this game sooner.

So obviously I got into it a good while after they had time to fix it, and honestly, when I got it, I had a few friends warn me against it, since they played at the very beginning. They called it clunky, slow, disconnected, and not what they would consider an Elder Scrolls game.\nAfter putting in some good time into the game, I have to say it must have SIGNIFICANTLY improved since my friends have played. The game does not lag or give off a clunky feel, and reminds me greatly of Oblivion as far as the questing goes. Things change in the games as you quest on, NPCs recognize you by your deeds, the graphics are fantastic, the animations are good, I could go on. Basically, it's a good game. If you are a die-hard TES fan, keep in mind there is only so much they can do in keeping it TES. It does feel like Tamriel, but there is a bit of disconnect that I think they can and will improve over time.\nThe thieving just came out, so I'm hoping for a full blown thieves guild quest line in the future, but who knows.\n\ntl;dr, at least try the game out. Expect good quests, expect a good mmo, don't hold it up to your normal TES standards, though.

And I am not just saying that because its a World of Warcraft killer in my heart. I only just picked it up as it became buy-to-play (no subscription) and to me it surprised me more than I have seen out of any game in a while. So see alot of terrible reviews of it from when it came out but I can garentee it is nothing like that now. In short its same as Skyrim but in a MMO...has the same charm as Skyrim, gameplay and feel but in a more active world. I could write alot about this game but needless to say I think it is amazing and under-rated.\n\nTo expand on why I think its great...Crafting is of somewhat intresting as you can find "Motifs" which unlock "styles" of weapons/armor you can make as you only unlock your selected character's race as the only starting crafting style. Next you have traits which give bonuses to items you make...however you must find an item with the train and then research it to learn how to make it. Lastly when looting or deconstructing items you may find rare-ish items that you use to upgrade gear stats to green, blue, purple or even yellow. On another note though, doing achivments can unlock you dyes which you can change the colours of your armor simular to Guild Wars 2. Stealing is a great way to make money as well as the posibility of obtaining instructions for crafting (such as cooking instructions or a motif book) so long as you dont get caught. Creating your character's abilities has alot of freedom to it as each class has 3 diffrent combat styles but every class has weapon, armor, racial, guild skills too they can spend skill point to unlocking abilities or passives.\n\nThough the very few bad points I could find are that the game handles really really well with low internet connection speeds but you should expect to wait for game elements to load if you have speeds under 400kb/sec as there is nothing more anoying as waiting for the enemy to render while its attacking you or trying to look a invisible chest. There is also a slight problem with overpopulation as its hard to go anywhere without worrying it may be overcrowded. Lastly, there is no real auction house in the game but "Guild stores" which you can access by being in a guild (Guild limit is 5 per account) so you can sell items on these guild stores which is only avalible to other guild members unless your guild has a "trader" NPC (traders allow people outside the guild to buy items from guild stores)","April 2, 2015","true","218.7"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","23","34","0","0"

Most side quests and the Main quest are just so interesting. All the conflicts in Tamriel and you are part of it.\n\n>Exploration\nI really liked exploring the world in Guild Wars 2. ESO also has an exploration system and many Mini Events / Achievements etc.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>>Settings\n>Customizable\nThe game lets you install addons very easily. This is an other feature that I never encountered so far in an MMO. You would like a Minimap besides your ESO compass? No problem, insert Minimap addon into the addon folder, done.\n\n>Video Setting\nI can play ESO with nice looking settings on my Main PC, while I'm also able to play it on my Low-Mid Tier laptop with no problems. The settings range from very low to very beautiful. So don't be afraid if you got a mid-tier PC / Laptop.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>Amazing solution for Micro Transaction / Subscription\nI've also never encountered an MMO with such an awesome solution about Payment. You buy the base game for a reasonable price. Ofc way better than the subcription system before. But they still got the Sub system. Subscribe and you get all DLC's playable for free while being a member, and get the same amount of ingame cash, like you would pay for the money. So while you pay 12$ per month for like 3 months, you can enjoy all DLC content, and as an extra reward, you would have enough money to buy the actual DLC for ever.

Blew my expectations way out of the sky. My favorite MMO by far.\n\nI was one of the people who thought this game was utter ♥♥♥♥, despite barely trying it on my friend's beta account. All the flak it got, I was one of those who gave it the flak.\n\nWhen I played my short-time @ my friend's in the beta, the combat was super clunky and was basically a tab target combat that TRIES to resemble action combat. Not to mention, literally everything in the beta was laggy.\n\nNow? Goodness the combat is amazing. It's no longer just a tab-target system (It still, however, does have some tab-target properties, but very minimal) it also uses it's own form of action combat I haven't seen in any MMO's. Obviously in MMO's, lots of things are restricted such as; combat, physics, etc. This is all because of lag and how it could handle, wether it's on the server side or the client side. However, this game captures great combat with many other awesome features. Physics are still a meh... but really, what can you expect from an MMO?\n\nSo much content...\n\nCurrently have not done PvP yet, as not high enough level, so won't comment on that.\n\nJustice system is fun and a GREAT breath of fresh air in an MMO. Look it up, it's basically the crime system (I.E. Murder, pickpocket, stealing, etc)\n\nWill revise when I get a bit further. Then will revise again after reaching end-game.","March 19, 2015","true","169.0"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

I thought there were so many bugs and that the game just wasn't very good.  That was beta at the time, but I had the impression that maybe it just wasn't to be as good as I wanted it to be.\n\nSkip ahead a year later, I got the sudden urge to try out ESO so I decided I would buy it, I needed a new game to play and become interested in. I'm so glad I went for it.  It's not often I find myself interested in a game and wanting to always play it. Most games I play for a few hours and come back to them a month or two later. But here I am, one month after purchasing it with over 200 hours.\n\nAny bugs I encountered during beta have all been fixed. Things I wanted to see get added to the game were added or recently implemented. No subscription also means I don't have to feel obligated to play this game and get my $15 a month out of it so I have the freedom to enjoy it whenever.  The world is huge, simple side quests are fun and enjoyable to do each with their own fully voice-acted stories.  The graphics are amazing, especially for utilization of the Hero Engine (WoW engine).  The crafting is unlike anything I've seen and has become one of my favorite things to do in the game. The amount of content there is in this game, race/class combinations, etc. have me wanting to play this game for a long time. I feel like I haven't even scratched the surface.\n\nMy only complaint is that group-questing with friends could be improved. It seems like you have to constantly check with your friends and ask "did you do this part yet? lol" because I feel that if you're in a close proximity, if someone does something, it should register for everyone in group. There are few quests that follow this, and it is present in dungeons, but I'd like to see this for every quest in game as it would make the whole "MMO" experience a bit more fluid.\n\nLet's Bang OK/11","April 2, 2015","true","290.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

I mostly do solo player content (which ESO is great at, to be honest), as I find it damn satisying in this game. The voice acting is wonderful, I find the majority of the quests to have enough depth and variation between them to keep me endlessly entertained, and the world is absolutely beautiful. I have, however, done a fair share of the PVE content (all the 1-50 4-man dungeons, most of the delves and dolmens, almost every public dungeon) and find that the game excels here as well. The group finder seems to be lacking still, but I think it's just because most people seem to ignore it and choose to form their own groups in chat. I haven't reached "end game" (Veteran ranks) yet or done any PVP so I cannot offer any feedback on these elements, but I will update here once I've experienced these parts of the game.\n\nTL;DR This game can very easily play as a single person MMO if you choose to go that route (which I have) and it is a very satisfying experience that way. My decent exposure to group PVE has been largely outstanding as well.

I didn't want to buy it in the past because I was expecting it to be dissapointing but it's rather enjoyable.\n\nYou want the short answer:\n\nIf you like Elder Scrolls and you want to play a fun game with other people, get the game. They're removing the monthly $15 fee on March 17th so you'll only have to pay $60 to play forever, or during a sale you could get it for cheaper (I got it for $20 during the Winter Sale). All in all the game is very enjoyable.\n\nYou want the long answer:\n\nKeep in mind that this is not "omg it must be liek skyrem 2 butt onlien!!!", this game is not exactly like Skyrim. Every TES game is different from the last, ESO is just as different in comparison but it's MMO nature changes the game a little more. A lot of the bad ♥♥♥♥ you heard about the game in the past has been fixed and the game is worth the money now considering you don't need to pay a lot. They fixed a lot of the bugs and the game has all in all been improved a lot.\n\nThey haven't introduced as many new zones recently as I had hoped for, but these things take time of course. The province of High Rock is almost to be fully completed with the Wrothgar (Orsinium) zone planned for release. The only other province in all of Tamriel (the world in every tes game) to be fully completed is Valenwood. The game is also larger than any previous TES game, excluding Daggerfall and Arena which were mostly randomly generated. It's an MMO, every MMO still adds on to it's world.\n\nThe graphics are great actually. Auridon is beautiful to see and the game isn't very hard on computers. I don't have the highest specs (2.3 Ghz, 16 GB RAM) but I can run this game at a steady 45 FPS on high/ultra settings. Don't get me wrong, it takes like 50 GB space for files considering it's huge size. Cyrodiil is said to be pretty laggy, as it's a PvP dedicated zone. Tons of battles cause some lag, but for the most part the rest of the world is fine. Game mechanics are easy to adjust, there's a button for everything and it's very user friendly.\n\nIt's not moddable. What the ♥♥♥♥ did you expect? It's an MMO. Don't get your hopes up, you can get addons. You can just visit ESO UI, download the file and put it in the addons folder, simple as that. Zenimax (the game devs) made it super easy to get addons. When your run your game there's even a built in options menu for addons and you can just toggle them on and off in game, really easy to use. Addons can also enhance graphics as much as you want if you have a high end PC.\n\nFrom what I've experienced, the whole player interaction thing isn't the best. Everyone is always at a different point in a quest unless you're doing a team dungeon. Still, you fight the same monsters at the same exact time so no matter where you are, the enemy is the same. You also have to walk up to a player and click a button to interact with them; this can get a bit tricky if they're moving around a lot. Trading is decent, guild stores everywhere, addons to help you find prices, people selling stuff in the chat but not spamming it, nice community.\n\nExtra features are nice to have. Sure, there's no player housing or appearance changing (after you've made your character of course) yet, but they're working on it. Fishing is great, other games had it where you ♥♥♥♥ing had to walk into a river and swim to find your enemies. Now you can get easily acquirable fishing bait and reel in some nice catches and it's not even a loss if you get something bad. Dyeing system (no, not dying system) is also great. You can die your armor fabolous pink or an odd shade of yellow in multiple places per piece, and it's pretty fun. You can't buy more colours and you can only get more by unlocking achievements, which is a pretty good system. The variety of crafting is amazing, from food to potions to woodworking to blacksmithing, you can do everything.\n\nThe combat system is better than any other Elder Scrolls game. Arena, Daggerfall, Redguard and Morrowind's combat systems sucked. Oblivion and Skyrim's were much better, but by far ESO is the best. The abilities and hotkeys are easy to use and user friendly, it's a much needed improvement we've finally gotten.\n\nThe developers are also amazing. They'll answer questions in videos, blogs, or even AMAs. Sometimes they play with people in game too. They keep the fans updated and give them news via twitter/blogs. They even have a PTS (Public Test Server) which can be used to test new content, and it's completely free and availible to all players.\n\nI'll just try to list down some pros and cons now.\n\nPros:\nGoing F2P soon on March 17th, all you'd need to do is buy the game once\nFun game, you don't get bored\nNice useful/fun features you can use (armor dyeing, crafting, fishing, etc.)\nIt's MMO nature doesn't bring it down\nHuge world to explore\nNot harsh on computers and easy to run\nEasy integration of addons\nBest combat system out of any Elder Scrolls game\nGreat communtiy\nMegaservers instead of a bunch of small servers, meaning you can meet your friends anytime anywhere.\nKing Kurog has a nice butt\nCons:\nThe PvP zones can be laggy.\nImmersion is an issue considering everyone is said to be the special "hero" and NPCs will act like they know you even if you haven't done the previous quest\nNo mods/singleplayer mode\nNo Australian/Asian/South American megaservers, limited to just North America and Europe.\nIf you're a fan of the TES series or just a regular RPG fan, I recommend getting this game, though you're better off waiting for the Spring/Summer sale for it to lower it's price.","February 2, 2015","true","573.0"," 38 of 64 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","38","64","0","0"

It's great now, though. My friend and I have discovered the notoriety system by accident. You can attack guards and become a wanted outlaw, but if you do this early in the game (level 5) you don't stand much of a chance against a town of guards. I laughed as I watched him get destroyed by the town guards for attacking an NPC, but not so much when it happened to me later. And no monthly fee anymore!

It is a great MMO that has great servers.  I have little to no connectivity problems.  The level system is similar to Skyrim without feeling like the same game.  The thing that you need to remember is that, this is a MMO first, then a Elder Scrolls game second.  It will do whatever it can to keep true to the ES series but sometimes falls off to keep that MMO style.  In late game you level up slowly, but with the mass amount of quest, you will easily level up.  It does a great job at not throwing you into a level 20 quest while you are level 8.  You can still do high level quest with some skill.  Even though there are just four classes.  That will not stop you from making that build into any ES build in any game.  I honesly love this game and plan to continue to play.","April 1, 2015","true","139.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/racistpancake/recommended/306130/","racistpancake","Gluten of Freevia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/racistpancake/","132 products in account","The game has received a lot of bad reviews talking about how it's a WoW clone and it's really buggy, (most of these reviewers played before the Tamriel Unlimited update went live) but I don't think it's true.\n\nBear in mind, I haven't got to endgame yet so I won't talk about it until I have, if I ever do.\n\nFirst of all, it's not buggy, I haven't played too much (around 30-40 hours at the time) and haven't found any bugs (unlike in Skyrim or any Bethesda game).\n\nNow, about it being a WoW clone, I don't think it's true (and I do play WoW quite frequently), and it feels way more similar to Everquest 2, mainly because it's very open (at least while leveling). When leveling up, you can walk in a direction and you'll probably find quests there, but it's also really good that it's almost impossible to get lost; in EQ2 I played through the tutorial and everything is cool, but then they take me to the city (Qeynos I think) and you're on your own, so I think "well, I guess I can just start picking up quests outside the city", and while it's true, I always ended up taking quests that were 5 levels higher than me, which resulted in awful grinding because I didn't know where to go. In ESO, by the time you get to the higher level quests, you'll be ready to do it, because they put the harder quests far from the starting zones.\nAlso, the quests can feel sometimes like they are the classic "kill X until Y drops" or "go to X, take Y and come back to me", because they are (just like in Skyrim or any other game) but they know how to hide it, and also you will sometimes get a choice and sometimes it is either the evil way or the good way, but sometimes it's not; the last one I did was about getting a crown for a noble woman and at the end, a ghost that has been helping you, tells you to release him by making the princess touch a cursed crown instead of the real crown, so basically you can give her the real crown or the cursed crown.\n\nCombat is kinda action based and kinda targeted, if you've played DC Universe Online, it's pretty much the same without combos, (but way more customizable thanks to the skills being based on your guilds, weapons, class and so on) if you haven't played it, you don't have an auto attack button like in all tab targeting games, but your regular attack is triggered by the mouse button, you can block and dodge, and you can charge your attack, but you also have the hotkey skills.\n\nCrafting is also a pretty big part of the game and it's actually pretty ok. I like it but it's not really innovative in any way. You get styles that change the look of the items, but not their stats (so you won't see everyone walking around in the same armor just because it's the most powerful one), and to change their stats you can:\n1) increase the ingots (or leather or whatever) that will go into the creation of the item, increasing it's level.\n2) use better materials, which will increase it's level even more, and change the look a little bit, but keep the same style.\n3) improve the item's quality using rare items, but the upgrade's success is based on how many of this items you use, and if you fail, the item will be destroyed. But this is also the only way to improve items without increasing it's level, which is useful because you can't equip items that outlevel you.\nAnd resource gathering isn't bad because there aren't too many mineral deposits, but you can destroy items you have to create materials.\n\nI've only been in one dungeon and it was really fun, and it's also a bit more social due to the fact that there's no group finder so you actually have to form a group, I don't really have much more to say.\n\nImperial City PvP is also really big but I haven't played much of it, and if you're into PvP it could be really fun. It also doesn't feel forced into the experience, so if you like PvE you don't actually need to play it.\n\nAlso, the graphics were criticized because they're stylized or "cartoony" but I really like them and you can play on potato PCs without any problem, I could run it in a non gaming netbook as long as I kept the graphics low.\n\nIt's also really good that there's no monthly sub so you never feel like you need to play and you can pick it up whenever you want.\n\nAll that being said, the game has it's flaws, but they don't ruin the experience (for me, at least), just hold it back.\n\nFirst of all is the community, specially in Daggerfall's (Daggerfall Covenant's starting zone) General Chat, it's basically Barrens' Chat. Mostly filled with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.  And then there's the people you'll find during your leveling experience, that will probably never respond to you and if you invite them to a group, they'll reject even though (s)he knows you're doing the same quest. But, of course, you'll also find some really cool people.\n\nThe mega server is awful, mostly because there are no "special ruleset" servers, so no world PvP and it's also a shame for roleplayers because the only way you'll find roleplay is in a roleplay guild. And it also doesn't serve it's purpose of making zones feel more alive and having friends play with you because it has some really weird phasing thing going on.\n\nThere are only 4 classes, and even though they're kind of customizable, having more would be great.\n\nAlso, for the first 16 levels, your gear will look the same way except for the racial styles.\n\nThere are not too many dyes and most of the easy ones to get aren't really good.\n\nOne of the most important ones is that you do get that feel of "I'm the One, but I still see 10 "the Ones" walking around".\n\nAnd the loading screens, I don't think they are that bad for everyone, but if you have a low end PC, you will have some really long loading screens.\n\nTL;DR (kind of).\nAfter all, I think it's a great game but don't go expecting Elder Scrolls 6, which was most people's mistake, but it's also not an ES themed WoW clone, it actually feels way more open and closer to the ES experience. Also, a little advice, don't rush to endgame, just like in any ES game, you don't rush through it, and now that there's no sub, there's no excuse to rush it.\n\nI'll probably update this review once I get to endgame, and I'll also check out the RPing community and overall experience.","August 24, 2015","true","72.1"," 24 of 38 people (63%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","63","24","38","6","2"

The world is a lot more interesting than most MMOs for example like any ES game you can find dungeons to delve into that have their own stories to tell.  The character customization is fantastic.\n\nThe "Tamriel Unlimited" update really brought the game to where it needed to be to be called an Elder Scrolls game.  This update added a justice system like you would see in any other ES game.  The "Guild Shop" feature replaces the auction house system that has become standard fare in most MMOs. Guild shops are set up in market stalls in every major city and allow members of that guild to sell their items from that stall, it results in players actively going to the market rather than standing around the same auctioneer all day and really makes the cities feel more alive with player activity.  This update also added the dye system in which armor dyes are unlocked based on achievements, for example fighters guild red can be unlocked for ranking up in the fighters guild.\n\nAlso you can launch the game without being signed into steam which is nice.","March 25, 2015","true","33.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

However, I did. And every single review I had read was utterly wrong. This game is phenomenal! If you're expecting Skyrim, well it is not Skyrim. In much the same way Skyrim was not Oblivion, Oblivion was not Morrowind, Morrowind was most definitely not Redguard, Redguard was most certainly not Battlespire, etc.. etc.. Every Elder Scrolls Game has brought something new and different to the table, this game is no exception. I'll admit the overall main quest is not the best, however it makes up for it by throwing you into a very pivotal point in the Elder Scrolls universe. A good example of this would be in Skyrim the single player aspect was wonderful, the civil war however was not. You could have played Skyrim without ever noticing that a civil war was raging. In ESO the opposite can be said. I could go on and on. But with the new systems and updates to come I honestly do not see ESO being F2P anytime soon. If you're really on the edge about it wait until they offer a trial.\n\n*Now that update 3 has come out you can now dye your armor, as well as they now have Guild Shops.

But seriously, just try it, even if not from steam and you buy the key somewhere else that is cheaper, grab it, and give it a go.\nAfter playing the beta i decided to wait a while before purchasing this, and during the beta we were provided with the opportunity to play as those who would purchase the imperial edition, so we had access to the imperial class, and a horse.\nIf you are trying to decide whether to spend the extra cash and purchase the imperial edition, then what you get is a class that is more suitable for the role of a tank, specialising in sword and shield, with heavy armour. You will also recieve a mudcrab vanity pet, which serves no purpose other than to follow you round. Also you recieve a horse which is equivalent to the 15,000 horse in game, so the cheapest one, however it is white. Finally you have the choice to play as any race in any alliance, which could be good, but i prefer to play in the factions that are meant to be played by each race.\nPersonally, i knew i wanted to be a Breton sorceror, specialising in conjuration, so i did not buy the imperial edition.\nBut yeah, i love this game and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the elder scrolls.\n","January 9, 2015","true","348.4"," 36 of 61 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","36","61","4","3"

A lot of people on here complain saying this game is disappointing, that it isn't a "true Elder Scrolls game". Well I disagree completely!\n\nThis game IS a proper Elder Scrolls game. At its core it is everything you would expect from a proper TES game - freedom to explore, freedom to forge your own character and playstyle, freedom of choice and freedom of approach to situations - do you go into a dungeon shouting battlecries and swinging your battleaxe, or do you take the stealthier approach? Both can be done, and are not mutually exclusive at all - you have total freedom in skill choice. It plays very similarly to the older titles in general, and you start off as a prisoner, escape and then go on to explore the world as you see fit. There is no linear progression path like in other MMOs. You could start in Morrowind for example but run around the entire zone in an unrestrained manner, killing monsters and exploring dungeons and ignoring quests if you so choose.\n\nYou can do almost everything in this game that you could in the older titles: Sneak around, steal things, murder people, join factions, make choices that affect the world, make your own unique character build, play in FIRST PERSON with the same / similar combat system to the older games with great new features, find hidden dungeons, secret lore, uncover mysteries etc. Even better is that more features will be added as time goes on.\n\nBut what this game does also is enhance the experience by adding new features from other MMOs. This makes it feel fresh and new, because it combines the best aspects of the singleplayer TES games and MMOs like WoW - you have an action bar associated with your weapon, with abilities hotkeyed to the number keys, which you use alongside your standard attacks, power attacks, blocking and bashing.\n\nIt breathes new life into the MMO genre I think by having a unique combat system that is addictive, intuitive, much more tactical, and above all FUN. It doesn't feel grindy at all either because the quests are all genuinely interesting and fun, the stories are meaningful and touching, as you would expect from an Elder Scrolls game, and the world is one I am deeply fond of and immersed in already from playing the older games for thousands of hours. Plus you can explore areas that haven't been available in a TES game since Arena or Daggerfall, like Summerset Isle and Valenwood - games which you can't exactly call high-tech.\n\nThe music is another strongpoint of this game, because even though it's clearly been designed to be as ambient and non-intrusive as possible for the MMO format, you can still hear familiar themes rise up from the pleasant ambience from time to time, like Watchman's Ease from Oblivion and Blessing of Vivec from Morrowind. The theme is also excellent and was composed by none other than Jeremy Soule, adding to the authentic feeling of the game.\n\nThen of course you have the multiplayer. I have yet to experience this, but from what almost everyone else has said it is supposed to be excellent. Time will tell for me, I've only scratched the surface of this beautiful game.\n\nSpeaking of beautiful, the GRAPHICS in this game are excellent and miles better than Skyrim's. The colours are vivid and rich, the shadows are excellent and free of striping that plagued the older games, all the animations are wonderful and smooth, the scenery is amazing and the flora / fauna of the world is highly consistent with older games - giant mushrooms, Alits, Netches and more in Morrowind for example.\n\nOn top of all this, we get to meet characters that have always been mentioned in books in previous games but whom we never met -  Mannimarco, Molag Bal, Sotha Sil in the upcoming Clockwork City DLC, to name a few. Speaking of DLC, this game is constantly being updated. They frequently add new areas, such as the recently added Orsinium, and factions such as the upcoming Dark Brotherhood. Eventually I hope they will add every last area of Tamriel, especially Vvardenfell!\n\nI think ultimately that the reason someone would dislike this game is not because it's objectively "bad" but simply because it isn't their cup of tea. I however love it - I would go so far as to say that it ranks alongside the older, legendary titles.","January 5","true","266.5"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","14","20","3","0"

The graphics are beautiful, the places you visit are very appealing to the eyes.  Like penut butter.\n-Actually well designed combat for an MMO.  I have absolutely no idea why MMO players enjoy the click-on-an-enemy-and-spam-abilities-till-it-dies combat system (cought WOW, LOTR:O, EQ1 and 2).  ESO has real time, mostly skill based combat.  You swing your weapon and you determine if you kick your enemy's ♥♥♥, not the computer.  Its a lot like Oblivion in terms of combat (for melee), which is great.  I personally haven't used bows as I hate playing as an archer mainly because archers are nerds, but from what I know the bows aren't that bad.  For someone who plays as a tank, I can say you'll have a blast.  The one down fall is no kill cams.\n-Great PVP.  Its kind of like Planetside, in the sense you take over enemy forts, meth labs, and outposts.  Its pretty fun.\n\n\nCons:\n-Immersion.  This is kind of a pro and a con, because the immersive elements are mostly there, but I'm putting it as a con because of 3 reasons:  the community, the lore, and the enviroment.  First off, the majority of the community does not respect TES lore when it comes to RP.  You'll see names that you'd expect to see in a CoD lobby such as "XXXGAMERFREAK666" or "SUPERDUPERJACKASS69" than lore friendly names.  Also, from experience, finding a good guild seems to be hard for someone that wants an RP guild.  I ran into a MLP guild, a 4/20 (they liked hitler i guess) guild, and a ton of stupid joke guilds before finding only one single lore friendly, RP guild.  I know you can't control people, but this is a TES game, so regardless TES fans expect a level of immersion on the community's behalf.  Secondly, the lore has certain errors which can break the immersion and make TES lore freaks get triggered and kill themselves with bleach.  This is pretty minor however, because it doesn't subtrack too much from the game.  And lastly the NPCs and quests.  The NPCs are pretty dull and uninteresting for the most part and the quests are mostly fetch this, talk to that person, kill x amount of feminists, and things like that.  Which, to be honest, seems to be common in the MMO genre.  However, despite that there are some really interesting quests and characters and  honestly, there were a LOT of dull quests in Skyrim (I'm looking at you, Civil War questline).\n\n\nTips:\n-its fun to run around with a friend and murder everyone you meet, even in cities.  if you do go on a jihad against everything, avoid the chickens.  it reaaaaaaaaaaaaaally pisses off the guards.  also guards can't be killed so prepare your legs for some running.\n-If you do find a girl, don't be jackass.  that might be the last real one you meet in ESO for the next millenia.  if you meet a man that has a girl character though, you can be a jackass because they are probably fat perverted heretics.\n-the ignore button is amazing and helps cleanse the world of heretics\n-in pvp, i highly recommend being a Templar because it pisses off higher levels with you magestic healing abilities.  i've been able to fight people 4-5x my level for a good 20 minutes as a templar\n-stealing is a great way to make money\n-get the imperial edition or just don't get it at all.  you'll want that horse.\n-you can get drunk and fight nords, which is amazing.","May 15","true","95.1"," 24 of 39 people (62%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","62","24","39","17","2"

No wonder those giants were mad and attacking...\n\nOn Another side quest (SPOILER) We were being attacked by some coventant so a friend thought it would be smart for her to get captured and try to get some info from them,,, the covenant was alligned with some witches who ate human eyes... long story short my friend got her eyes fed to a witch and lost her sight forever, Sure i rescued her and killed the witches but her sight is forever lost.\n\nAnd that is just a side quest but they are all like that, fully voiced, well acted and amazing stories.\nIts really a master piece of a game story wise.\nI literally think im doing a main quest several times because i think NO WAY THIS IS JUST A SIDEQUEST, but it is...\n\nI really feel like: what kind of adventure will this game provide me next with some random side quest and off course i still have the 4 main quests, from the guilds, and the main main quest.\n\nSo it really has a LOT of content and i honestly dont think i will every finish it since i already have aound 100 hours and i literally am just a noob who only knows like 6 dungeons so far.\n\nJust take your time with this game, it will be slow at start, specially without a mount, but once you get that and reach around lvl 15 the game really shines.\n\nI played WoW, Swtor, ffxiv, tera, GW2, NVW and lots of other MMOs and this one is honestly the richest story wise and immersion, i really LOVE about 90% of the side quests, and i dont say all of them cause there are still some old side quests which are just crap but so far, 90% of them are like a mini main story, its incredible.\n\nCombat is pretty good, i really feel like im swinging my 2h sword in the enemies bodies but i cant say much more cause i am still a noob who doesnt know what im doing but so far so good.\n\nIt does have some bugs but so far nothing big.\n\nAbout the store i honestly didnt even check it out so far cause i dont need anything other than what the game brings.\n\nAnd thats it so far, back to my adventures, atm i have to kill an ancient Vampire so wish me LUCK!!!!","April 9","true","528.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","0"

It's borderline perfect, for an MMO it is excellent. Well worth the money if you have it spare. But, this is a review right? So, let me review.\n\n1) Lore\nWell, firstly. It's a multiverse, so if you're a returning fan of the franchise, you may be dissapointed to find that all that old lore you loved or were just getting into, is pretty much gone, shattered and destroyed. Really, any old knowledge you have is most likely useless now. BUT they have new, rather good replacements (from what I've found so far) and for an MMO? The way they include you in this, the way they explain it and sew it into the world is absolutely beautiful.\n\n2) The World.\nThe cities are actually rather beautiful. The environment, day/night cycle, weather... It's often breathtaking. Area's are easy enough to navigate, yet complex enough to hold a fair bit of novelty for a few hours at least depending on how you play. The map system is absolutely lovely in how it compliments this also.\n\nIt may not be labelled open-world, but honestly I'm not even sure why. It's an adventurers dream in a lot of cases, especially for an MMO.\n\n3) The Story.\nIt's an MMO, it doesn't have any. Right? Wrong. I haven't paid all too much attention to the main questline, simply due to habit. But oh my gosh, those side quests? Absolutely riveting. Even if the story, fully voiced dialogue and streamlined progress wasn't enough, the moral choices and the effects they have afterwards are just superb.\n\n4) Levelling.\nOk, this is something I dislike. No, it's not agonizingly slow, but it definitely leans towards the tedious, For an MMO it's about average, but for a TES game it is rather painful, I have to admit.\n\nAs you level, you gain both skill points and stat points, the stats you place into magic, which ups your staff and magic skill damage, stamina which ups your weapon and stamina-related skills damage, and health which lets you take more of a beating. The skill points are pretty damn flexible, allowing you to place in any of the class or weapon skills you meet the requirements for.\n\n5) Classes.\nAnother thing I'm a little unhappy with.\n\nIt's a relatively open class system, as in you can go as a mage with a two handed axe and a bow that purely relies on traps if you really wanted. But, from the beginning you are locked into a certain class, these determine your class skills - Which are some of the best, and most powerful you get. Better than a lot of MMO's, but not for a TES game, again.\n\n6) Misc.\nDo you want to be an infamous thief? A werewolf? A vampire? A murderer? Blacksmith? Alchemist? Chef? Fisherman? Merchant? Really, as far as non-killing activities are concerned, they have got a solid 8/10 stars from me. I spent my first ten hours in the same area pickpocketing people and sneaking around before someone offered to turn me into a werewolf and I then spent time devouring hapless.... Everything.\n\n7) Combat.\nNothing too special here really, an auto-lock aiming system as wide as the Great Wall of China, yet customization, skills, dodging and blocking that makes up for it nicely in later levels, it requires a fair bit of skill to get right, and is quite fun to master once you get it rolling.\n\n8) Customization.\nBetween the multitude of races, classes, weapons and armours you can choose from, not to mention the above-average character creation system in place - As well as the guilds, factions, werewolf/vampire options and so much similar, you really can create your very own character. It's almost perfect.","February 15","true","168.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Beetophulus/recommended/306130/","Beetophulus","Beeto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Beetophulus/","249 products in account","Fun for both singleplayer and multiplayer. Beginning, you can have a total of 8 characters at a time. You'll have the option to choose from every race minus Imperials (unless you have the DLC). The classes are DragonKnight- Uses some dragon powers, Templar- Aedra priest of death, Sorcerer- Fancy name for mages, and NightBlades- Fights with shadows and darkness. Whichever you choose, I'm sure you'll find a comfortable fighting style. You'll also choose to join from either the Pact, Covenant, or Dominion. Your character will represent these factions for PvP in Cyrodiil. But don't worry, whichever you choose, you'll still be able to explore every available territory in singleplayer after completing Coldharbour. I guess for singleplayer/co-op you could say there are 4 campaigns, one for each faction, and Coldharbour. Throughout the game you'll go from country to country saving the world from those darn Daedra worshippers, and building power along the way. There are 49 levels, each requiring more XP than the last, and then 16 Veteran Ranks or VRs, which require 1M XP each. And with all of the quests and sidequests, I don't think you'll have a problem getting to the high VRs in time. With each level you'll recieve a point to upgrade skills. Scattered across the continent are crystals called Skyshards, which of every 3 can be combined into another skill point. Occasionally you'll recieve another set of points which can be used in a constellation perk system also seen in Skyrim. As an MMO, there are times when grouping is best, but when you aren't grouping it almost feels singleplayer if you'd prefer it to be like the other games. And for those tough enough to last, there's multiplayer. Each faction enters though a different corner of Cyrodiil to fight for territories in a giant game of capture-the-Elder Scroll/king of the hill. In the center lies the Imperial City (DLC needed) which is overrun with Daedra and enemy players. It's survival of the fittest out there, so you'll be fighting god-like enemy Veterans who will defend their forts and Elder Scrolls. Overall I love this game. Best Elder Scrolls in my opinion. I definitely recommend, but wait for a sale if you're considering buying.","March 5","true","514.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","1"

I'd be perfectly happy to be just a regular citizen that has to rise up in ranks through skills and given quest that would make sense in an mmo setting. This makes it hard for me to get into any of the story lines of this game, I just end up skipping through dialogue which is something I never or rarely do in elder scrolls games, because it just feels like I’m going through a haunted house in the carnival, it’s all “fake”. Half the time I have no idea what is going on in a quest, I just know I gotta kill the boss at the end, or retrieve some stuff, or burn some stuff, and I just end up grinding through quest to level up, rather than being fully immersed in the story line. It’s just… so boring. I think the reason why is because as someone who does only pve it’s just feels like I am doing the same thing over and over again, and with no story line to be invested in, it gets old quick.

Fighters guild and Mages guild are in, like a Main quest for you to finish, which takes you to Oblivion and back. Just like the earlier games. There is crafting now (unline in Oblivion and earlier games), since it is standard in MMOs. The combat is as it was in Oblivion and Skyrim: Dependend on how well YOU fight - there is no buttonmashing-autowin like in WoW or Everquest.\n\nSo, if you have good abilities - but suck at combat, you die. You can multiclass, like in the original games, the ONLY other game that lets you do this was Horisons. (When i played Horizons long ago, all the players talked about was how much they wanted an elderscrolls MMO.) ESO also support GUI mods, which helps out alot. There is already a minimap and a "harvester" like mod that helps you find resources, as well as several total GUI overhaul mods. - check out ESOUI.COM for more info on those. There is also less grind and more content to do.\n\nWhat i do not like about it: I have unfortunately run into a few zones with invisible walls. This i refer to as Bad game Design. There is some lag issues that one of my guild friend also have and some other people as well (they stop moving when i do, and go on when i get unstuck), there isn't ONE auctionhouse or broker, there are PLENTY of them, which makes finding a specific item very hard since you have to go to town to town and talk to 5-6 vendor in each town, and you have to input the same search parameters EVERY TIME you talk to a new NPC vendor.\n\nYou also have to join a guild to sell items, if the guild cannot afford to offer and win an vendor in a town for a week, you cannot sell any of your hard earned loot to other players - except the people in your guild who then are the only ones who can access the guild store. Unlocking storage (your backpack) and bank space is cheap for the first 10-30 slots, but then it gets expensive. Some quests are annoying and just a variation on a theme, you walk for 2 minutes and run into a NPC that want you to help save his/her village, you walk another 2 minutes and find a similar NPC whos town is attacked and needs saving.\n\nOverall: Definitly one of the better MMOs out there, and if you are an elderscrolls geek - click the Buy button now!","March 23, 2015","true","342.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","1"

ESO has some pretty great features, and has already shown future updates and inovations in action rather than just talking about them.  In regards to the gameplay, it's very streamlined with a very smooth combat system and a few trees of class skills along with weapon, armor, world etc skills that make this game very easy to theorycraft, and less meta build focused like other games.\n\nThe crafting system is very easy to use, and rewarding as well.  Several crafting skills are actually useful and worth investing into, that make a visable difference in gathering etc.  The UI could use a little work, it doesn't show buffs or debuffs as you would expect it to.  The game does support addons, which fixes that issue pretty well though.\n\nThe entire world is done beautifly and the game is very fun to play, with a lot to do.  The PvP is very similar to WvW from GW2, but much larger and more interactive.  When seiging a keep, you can visably watch the walls crumble as you hit them with seige weapons.  Amazingly the race you pick can also impact what class you play as, due to racial traits actually being useful.  If you are into theorycrafting builds and not settling for a cookiecutter meta build or enjoy pvp, dugeons, NOT fighting for mobs, great world interaction, or pet mudcrabs, this may be the game for you.\n\nI struggled with the investment of a b2p then p2p game for a long time, but eventually caved and I don't regret it.  This game is amazing.  The customer service is also very fast and helpful, in my experience replying within the same day(generally within an hour or so).  It is noteworthy that the game is still new, and it isn't perfect.  That being said, the only bug I've found was a graphical error two weeks ago regarding a broken wall.  I'd highly recomend this game to anyone who enjoys mmos.","July 29, 2014","true","271.6"," 250 of 465 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","250","465","0","19"

I will just speak my opinion on what my experience of the game is.\n\nI can with most certainty recommend this game! I started playing it one week before they opened it to be a B2P game, and the first feeling i got was very similar to the one I got when I first played Skyrim, which was "WOW! this game is going to be epic!". With its amazing soundtrack, voice acting and endless distractions it will take you on a journey that may never end. The graphical experience is not as sharp as in the modded Skyrim, but it is still an amazing experience.\nI have yet to discover the guild system and have not yet played any extended time in groups but I still find it amazing. Just loving the many opportunities the game offers.\n\nFor me MMORPG is not a genre that offers that much in game experience, I have tried many of the offers out there and never felt the epicness the fans of the genre is talking about. But I start to understand it with this game.\nWhen I heard the sweet voices of Michael Gambon and John Cleese there were some goosebumps of nostalgic love.\nThere's no doubt about it that the game needs more work, and this is a big fan of the ES series talking, but this adventure is one I do not want to miss.\n\nYou're welcome to hate my opinion if you like, but it is just that...

Best of all, you have the Elder Scrolls story and environment, first person view option, and excellent voice acting for NPCs.

I watched countless hours of interviews, Shoddycast Elder Scrolls Online Weekly and Elder Scrolls lore videos, read the newsletters and "Ask Us Anything" articles on the ESO website. I built up my own hype for this game, engaging in lengthy conversations and even arguments with my friends and high school classmates about this game. I think the pinnacle of my hype came in late 2013 while watching the stream for the E3 convention. The trailer featured the voiceover of Michael Gambon, the actor who played the late Dumbledore in the Harry Potter franchise, whom I instantly recognized and which triggered me to send several texts to my friends, and a tweet or two on top of that. Following that, the coverage of Elder Scrolls Online, and my overall opinion of the game, began to slowly plummet. I was part of two weekends of beta testings, much of which I encountered bugs and glitches which did not surprise me or dissuade me in the slightest- a large MMO such as this was bound to have a good number of them. Coverage of these bugs was fairly brutal, however. But the thing that did deter me was, of course, payment. I have never, nor most likely will I ever, pay a monthly fee for access a game. $15 a month was just too much to ask for, even though I was making $11.25/hr sorting packages for FedEx. Beyond that was the announcement of the imperial edition. I was very enthralled in learning about the preorder package, coming with a sculpture of Molag Bal himself, and a nice lore-oriented  artwork book. But I was not keen on learning that the imperials became an entire race available only to those who got the imperial edition, as well as the any-race any-alliance malarkey. I had one friend who went and bought the $100 box set, recieved the plastic Molag Bal statue, the book, and the digital content, and then proceeded to pay $15 a month of his parents' money up until now. I did not buy the game at all. There came a point where I sat down and looked at my collection of Elder Scrolls games and basically gave up hope for ESO. I wasn't going to buy the game at all. Not even the game going on sale on Steam could assuage me. ESO fell from my high aspirations as a game that me and my friends could play together and enjoy to a very sat state indeed. Zenimax, as painted and portayed by the gaming media, became greedy and did not listen to the cry of the consumer. This sad affair lasted until my one friend who had bought and subscribed to ESO told me and a few other people that Elder Scrolls Online was going buy to play. My interest was rekindled in the game, and I found myself watching the cinematic trailers once again. I bought ESO a couple days before it officially went B2P for $60, the first time I had spent $60 on a single game since Skyrim. It took me two agonizing days for the download to complete, which aligned itself with my spring break. It took me four hours to come up with a name and design my new character and join the game, comparable to my past Elder Scrolls character creations. Joining the game, I soon realized that ESO has changed a fair bit since I last experienced it, it has relatively become a word I use very selectively- polished.  In this past week, I have spent 32 hours on ESO. That's a lot for me, to the point that I should be recalculating my life. But do I regret it? Not in the slightest. Elder Scrolls Online is an enjoyable experience, and feels the way an MMORPG should feel. The UI is not the main focus of the game, thankfully. I don't feel rediculous when I use hotkeys. The various quest lines do not feel linear in any way. Exploration is something I want to do. Crafting doesn't make me suicidal. PvP isn't as big of a cluster ♥♥♥♥ as it could have been. This game feels like it belongs in the Elder Scrolls universe to me, and can be enjoyed with friends and other people. Though, I still firmly believe that Zenimax has a ways to go with this game, I can recommend playing Elder Scrolls Online to people who are as I was- fenced between the overall bad public image of the game and the incredible potential of this game. I just hope and pray that Zenimax knows what they're doing with the introduction of the crown store.","March 22, 2015","true","107.3"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

Specifically the lack of any sophisticated mechanics that add any element of strategy to the selection of skills or abilities.  Ostensibly, there are only three relevant stats: Health, Magicka, and Stamina.  Your combat abilities scale entirely based on Magicka or Stamina, depending on which resource they use.  There is no further optimization of stats or choice of specialization, which would be acceptable if even those two stats mattered at all.  As far as I can tell, your character recieves 20 points of each stat per level and a choice of where to add an additonal 10, up to a soft cap depending on your level which all but prevents you from specializing at all.  So every character is going to have almost identical stats reguardless of desired specialization.\n\nMoving on from stats to abilities, most abilities do nothing except various kinds of damage.  Some do area damage, some have longer range, some have extremely minor debuffs that don't work on any enemies that actually matter.  A small handful of abilities provide some variation, such as defense or moving yourself or enemies around.  Since you only have 5 ability slots, each of these abilities cuts into your offensive ability.\n\nThe aesthetics of the game are acceptable, but nothing to write home about.  They seem to have opted for a hybrid of the realistic style of TES games, mixed with the cartoony style of most fantasy MMOs.  I think they would have been better served by one or the other, most likely the former so as to appeal to TES fans who seem to have largely rejected the game already.","January 11, 2015","false","60.3"," 182 of 338 people (54%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","54","182","338","16","10"

This is my opinion.\n\nThis is not bad game because everything cool stuff in Crown Store like you can buy Exotic horse, pet and some costume armor. But most dissapoint is Adventure Pack. You cant play any race, any alliance unless you bought Adventure Pack from Crown Store.\nImperial Pack is not bad, only good you can get Imperial Race, Horse and Mudcrab(Pet) . You cant get Imperial Motif installed in other race even you bought Imperial Pack. Only Imperial Race have installed motif. Well if you want Imperial motif in your other race, you can buy from Crown Store, from player or loot 0.01% chance. thats fine to me.\nIn first person camera still bad. Dev need more work for first person camera and fix field of view. Mostly people playing with third person.\n\nIn my opinion. Just make this game free. Nothing special you bought for $60.

Also, monthly subscription is no required anymore. You just buy it and play it forever.\n\nMy opinion in technical aspects:\n\n- The graphics are beautiful. Above the average of MMOs.\n- The OST is epic, as you can expect from an Elder Scrolls.\n- The voice acting. The voice acting pulls you deep into the game creating an excellent immersion.\n- Because of the points mentioned before, the game REALLY FEELS LIKE AN ELDER SCROLLS GAME, while being an MMO.\n- The freedom you have building your character. Even when there are only 4 classes, since every class can use every weapon and armor, possibilities are huge. Every weapon and armor type has its own skill-tree, and you can develop your character by your own flavour combining any skill in those trees.\n- The new justice system! It allows you to play as an outlaw and make profit in the black market as a smuggler, for example.\n- You have a lot of things to do in Tamriel. You can do solo or group PvE, you can do quests, hear every character story, read books, find treasures, go to Cyrodiil and wage some war, kill and steal from NPCs, you can role-play, you can fish, you can craft, I don't know... Just buy it, you won't regret it.\n\n\nNow, for my actual review:\n\nINTRO\nI played TESO during beta. It took me less than 10 minutes to say "WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥" and uninstall that horrible piece of garbage. I was so upset and I didn't want to know anything else about damn Elder Scrolls Online.\nEven when I lost my interest for TESO, I'm an avid MMO player so I'm always reading news, forums and stuff about them. That's how I got to know that the game was greatly improved over time and how I turned my eyes back again to it.\nThen it came the TAMRIEL UNLIMITED thing, with the NO MORE SUBSCRIPTION REQUIRED ANYMORE, and I started to seriously think about giving it a try. It took me some days to decide but I did it. No regret.\n\nREVIEW\nOne of the biggest concerns about The Elder Scrolls Online during its development was, "will they be able to keep The Elder Scrolls flavour and details while making it an MMO?". I don't know how this was in the begining, but now, for the time I've been playing, I must say that they nailed it.\nThey nailed it taking in consideration how difficult must be to take an epic single player adventure of such previous fame and converting it to an MMO, and they did it guys.\nI didn't dive to much in the content yet, just made a few main quests and then I started to do what? TO STEAL LIKE I AND EVERYBODY DID IN THE SINGLE PLAYER ELDER SCROLLS!\nI've been stealing, killing citizens of Tamriel and guess what? I bought a horse with the money I made selling stolen items in the "Outlaw's Refuge"! I didn't dive in the actual content but I'm having a lot of fun doing random stuff and I really feel like playing an Elder Scrolls while seeing a lot of people doing stuff too by my side. I saw there are player guilds focusing in commerce, others in leagerdemain, others in war, others PvE, others Role Playing, yes, it's an MMO, but it really feels like an Elder Scrolls.

Of course, there's really an easy community for any type of player and ESO players have, in my experience, been some of the most helpful and friendly gamers I've dealt with on PC or consoles.\nFree to play and play is free. Once you've bought the game, it's now free which is definitely nice. Once you're in the game, you can do whatever you'd like. There is no hard line that says where and when you have to go do anything.\n\nThe Cons\n\nGrouping is semi-difficult and allows for some serious wackiness (dungeon lvl 10, but all non-leader party members are lvl 40. Waat?)\nLack of some of the epic feel of previous ES titles. One's world isn't that heavily shaped by the decisions he makes in the game.\nPvP is outrageous imo. Spamming AoEs seems to be the main strategy, so many sieges tend to look like straight Biblical disasters with similar carnage, but no real skill. Lots of people and lots of ranged firey effects.\nThe Crown Store. I find paying for cosmetic enhancements frustrating and ridiculous.\nNo dueling options. This was one of the only features I loved about WoW. You could challenge your friends who played "on the same team". There are "dueling guilds" but they practice dueling within a PvP zone that is based on huge group combats. It's cumbersome.\n\nWait for a sale, but this game is definitely worth playing.","April 19, 2015","true","70.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IAMGLITCH/recommended/306130/","IAMGLITCH","Glitch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IAMGLITCH/","49 products in account","This is a great MMO if you're looking for an MMO with a twist.  Unlike other MMOs this one has many elements that most others do not focus on.\n\nFor instance, like the other ES games, you can steal things.  Furthermore, certain quests allow you to make decisions that may have a different outcome depending on what you choose.  Also, you can make and use any weapons or armor you like, however you must learn to use the weapons (by using them and raising your skill) in order to unlock the weapon abilities.\n\nThere are 4 classes: Tank, Mage, Healer, Sneak.  (They're not actually called these things, however, I used general terms to make it easier to understand what each of them actually focuses on.)\n\nYou may be one of the 4 classes with each character you create, and each class has a different set of abilities you can learn.  You do NOT have to focus on class skills if you would rather focus on weapon skills (or you could mix the two), however, one of the biggest benefits of class skills is that you do not have to have a certain weapon equipped to use them, which is nice.\n\nAlso this game is pretty action based.  Moving around is crucial, especially when facing bosses.  There is a dodge button, as well as block (and the push back block).\n\nThe way they set up mounts is also unique compared to other MMOs I've played.  Each actual mount has its own set of skills you can level up once per day for 250gold.  These skills are as follows: Speed, Stamina, and Carry Capacity (allows your character to carry more if that particular mount is assigned).  Each of these skills is maxed out at 60.\n\nAlso, your bank is actually shared between all your characters.  This makes it easy for one character to give to another without sending something in the mail (which, so you know, you cannot send anything to yourself).  Mail also is shared between characters, as well as the guilds you choose to join.  I believe you may have up to 3 guilds at any given time.\n\nSelling items to players is only obtainable through guilds.  The guildmaster may buy a space at any of the guild trading zones, and all players of that guild may sell their items there.  You can access the auction house at the bank, but only, of course, if you're in a guild with that option.\n\nOf course, there's also selling items directly through trading, but that isn't quite as easy to do without ranting about the item in public.  Not exactly my style, but some people apparently like it.\n\nIt is important to note that this game is not another "Skyrim".  If it were a one player game, they could easily make it as customizable as Skyrim, however, being an MMO, it has to be limited, otherwise the customizability would cause the world to become too chaotic...  No one would even want to play.\n\nIt does have elements in it unique to the MMO genre, but you can't move everything or pick up things and throw them across the room.  You can kill civilians, but of course, they come back to life after a while.\n\nGuards are not currently killable, so don't even try it.  They will ruin you.  If they come after you, RUN and hide as quickly as possible.  You can run into the thieves locations for a quick getaway, so make note of their locations in main cities before you choose to commit crimes.\n\nIn the end, I really like this game myself.  For an MMO, it's definitely one I enjoy playing.  I look forward to seeing what they will choose to bring into the game next, and I give this game a thumbs up.","November 22, 2015","true","525.2"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

At least twice as long, if not three times. Some people win the lottery and have no problems with the download, installation, updates, repairs, etc. Many of us aren't that lucky. Having spent the last week trying to get this game to work after having to uninstall due to a major glitch, I'd recommend just avoiding this mess of a game altogether.\n\nIt's not a terrible game, as games go. A bit boring, a bit repetitive, but strangely addictive. For an MMO there's virtually no social interaction as far as I've been able to tell. If your internet isn't amazing it's going to lag quite a bit and that'll get you killed. Loading screens take an age and a half. The file itself is ENORMOUS and took up a third of my hard drive. Again, lots of glitches: NPCs malfunction and go invisible, my favorite instance of this being when invisible enemies attack and kill my character. My second favorite is when NPCs crucial to a quest can't be interacted with because they won't load.\n\nCollecting materials is an enjoyable task. The graphics are fairly impressive. Dye stations are cool. Like I said, not a bad game. It has its merits. There are lots of quests, lots to keep you distracted. I don't dislike it, when it works properly, but the primary reason I continue to (try) playing it is because I would like to get my money's worth out of it. I spent too much money on this game and I intend to play until I manage to feel like it was worth it. If I could go back in time, though, I would tell myself not to buy it; I knew that within an hour of playing it for the first time, but by then it was too late to get a refund because I had been "playing" it for eight hours--that is, the download from the launcher took eight hours.\n\nYikes. Just yikes.\n\n\nEDIT: When I posted this review, I had logged 35 hours of game time, eight of which--as I mentioned--were actually spent downloading from the launcher. In the time between posting and now, that number has shot up to 65. I have not played the game in that interim. That is 30 hours of recorded downloading from the launcher alone, after what was very literally hundreds of hours working on downloading from Steam over the course of several weeks. My internet and laptop aren't the world's fastest, but they're not slow. This game has issues.

Want a potbelly? No problem\n- Very high freedom of character development, it's likely you won't see 10 people with same builds in the same room\n- What you do makes you .. level up.\n- Stable economy with not so much emphasis on goldly wealth.\n- PvP of epic proportion\n- Most importantly, not pay to win; almost all Crown Store stuffs are for aesthetic prettiness only\n\nDislike:\n- Big area sometimes makes you wonder if you are actually playing a single-player game instead of an MMO\n- Face and body feature customization could use more choices. My hero's chest is not hairy enough.\n- Realtime collision-based combat also means the slower and less agile among us would be disadvantaged\n- IMO all Class skill lines should also be open to everyone. Dragonknight+Sorcerer would be awesome\n- Lack of chat bubbles or dialog subtitles make towns somewhat ... quiet (Chat bubbles feature is on the way though)\n- What? No skill lines for Fist weapons?\n\nSummary:\nI've played many MMOs before, but TESO is a breath of fresh air to me. Sure, it has bad reviews during the Beta, but exposing the rough edges IS the whole point of beta-testing anyway. Also, remember that this is an MMORPG, not a single player game, so of course it will not be 100% like Skyrim.

And it is a fun game if you're playing with your friends. And its about to drop it's subscription requirement so that is why this game is "recommended" in my case. But it is a typical MMORPG and it does not really capture all the things we loved about Skyrim and Oblivion. Enjoyable yes. Dissapointing, yes as well. I'll list the games highs and lows and you can decide for yourself.\n\nI am a huge fan of the past elder scrolls games. I've played them all and fell completely in love. This game holds the elder scrolls name, but that is where the similarities end. Don't get me wrong. I'm not dissing the game. Its a good game. I'm just being honest. So many reviewers on other websites and youtube channels (ESPECIALLY AT RELEASE) danced around the differences, not really telling you what they are. If you want a elder scrolls experience, this is not the game for you. However, it's not your typical MMO either, and is a little more fun than most.\n\nLets talk about some of the differences between elder scrolls and this game:\n\nThe combat UI: The health, Mana, and Stamina bars are the same as they were in Skyrim; however the rest of the combat UI just doesn't feel quite right, it doesn't feel as smooth when hacking and slashing as it did in Skyrim, and it holds a little more of a typical MMO type combat, similar to the KOTOR online combat. This is especially true with the archery, where as in Skyrim and Oblivion archery was realistic and a little challenging to master, In ESO you basically just draw back, point it in the enemies general direction, let loose and the arrow will simply find its mark.\n\nThe graphics: The graphics differ alot from Skyrim, but they are not bad. The character graphics are good, you can tell little things and aspects of your character, very clear and crisp coloring. However I feel like the graphics slipped a little from the realism of Skyrim into the un-realism of some other MMO's. It is only slightly though, they luckily don't even come close to the cheesy WoW graphics. This also depends on what graphical setting you run your PC on.\n\nThe questing system: The questing system itsef is actually really impressive. The entire game is fully voiced, by wonderful voice actors. And the conversation with NPC's has a similiar look to Skyrim (just to give you an example). That being said, some of the quests are pretty boring, typical MMO "go for" missions. But there are several fun quests, and the game leans moe towards exploring than questing anyway.\n\nThe weapons: I have to touch on this because a part of me was super dissapointed. I really dislike the way most of the weapons look, especially the one handed swords and bows. They just look cheesy and un-realistic. Now that being said, some of the weapons are alot easier to use than in past games, take a two handed sword or axe for example, in skyrim you were limited because they were so incredibly slow. They move alot quicker and alot more fluidly, which gives you the power of a two hander without a huge speed reduction.\n\nThe PvP: Now this feature I like, I wish there was more of it. When you reach a certain level, you and your friends can besiege a castle controlled by other players, if you win, you keep the castle and get rewards. You can also gain and use siege weapons (like catapults and ballistae) If you control all the castles around the imperial city, you control imperial city and the highest scoring player on your team becomes emperor. There can be hundreds of players in PvP which makes it daunting, but fun at the same time.\n\nI hope you can see that this game is its own type of beast, if you want a elder scrolls experience, you're out of luck; if you want a typical MMO experience, you won't really find it here. This game is enjoyable but after playing it, I have to say I wish I would have waited for full "free-to-play" instead of paying 60 dollars for it. But if you've got the money, and can't wait to try this out for yourself instead of reading about it, go ahead. The subscription fee is about to be dropped anyway, but who knows how big a role in-game purchases will become. It may end up that we were better off subscribing. Just remember all the things I told you in this review, know what to expect so you're not dissapointed, and enjoy. I hope you found this review helpful.","March 10, 2015","true","110.6"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

The scenery and graphics are what make this game.  Online really has no point.  Yes there are player vs player matches, but the dungeon missions are stupid.  Suddenly the same creature takes 4 people 10 minutes to kill because they simply say "this mission requires 4 people".  None of this game really requires any other people, and there is no story line contingent upon your actions.  There is no real reason to interact with another player you see running around, it's pointless to be online quite honestly.\n\nAll the other aspects are interesting at FIRST, but quickly get old.  Run around in an open world, encounter random people and do anything they ask.\n\nDo that 10,000 times.  Half the time you run to one building, click to talk to one person, run back, click ot talk to another, fight a few guys, then run back again to talk and get some crappy reward that really makes no difference.\n\nTIP: The game is scripted to go ONE WAY.  It does not matter what choice you make to kill, or let someone go.  It won't make a difference.\n\nI really got bored with this game, I gave it until the veteran ranks and now I'm just trying to run past the same crap non-stop and see if I can just beat a quest that's above my level.  Really, a repetitive boring game with good graphics.","January 30","false","170.1"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","15","24","3","1"

Not quite the lore of Skyrim, or Oblivion, and certainly not Morrowind. There will be arguments whether or not it's canon. There will be arguments whether it actually counts as an Elder Scrolls games. Take them with a grain of salt.\n\nAs an MMO, I cannot say whether it's good or bad, as this is the only MMO I've played. I have found it highly enjoyable in the few hours (less than 10 at the time of writing this) I have played. The quests seemed a little grind-y, but I figured that's typical of an MMO. The community is incredibly friendly to new players, answering questions patiently from people such as myself who were daunted by the vast amount of content. Within an hour of playing I was questing with another player all over Betnikh (I think that's how you spell it) and Daggerfall for the next 8 hours. it was incredible.\n\nI've found the game highly enjoyable, and well worth the wait for the download. (Install isn't quite 85 gigs, and the download was compressed to about 30, massively reducing the download time). I cannot thank my sister enough for buying me this over the Christmas sale. If I knew it was this good, I would have bought it months ago.\n\nThe game, even on my Intel integrated GPU, runs quite smoothly. System requirements are quite low so even if you have a toaster, you should get at least 24 FPS as you adjust the settings according to your hardware.\n\nMy only disappointment in this game is that I cannot play it much due to having only a limited amount of internet data per month at home, thusly my need to go to public wifi sources to play. ♥♥♥♥ you, Verizon, with your massively overpiced internet and monopoly over my town\n\nAll in all, I find this game incredibly fun. Maybe it's the "new game" hype I have every time I play a game for the first 50 or so hours, so maybe if my view changes over time, I'll adjust this review. But for now, I cannot stress enough how much I love this game. I highly recommend it to any MMO or ES fan for it's solid gameplay.\n\nAlso, no monthly fees like some MMOs I could name...","February 16","true","15.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheNerdtoKnow/recommended/306130/","TheNerdtoKnow","Krystic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheNerdtoKnow/","71 products in account","**Edit** Amended at end with full review details **\n\nThis is not a detailed review by any means, as I cannot yet speak for 100% of the content; However, it is rare that such detailed completion can be claimed by reviewers of MMOs. At any rate, The Elder Scrolls Online appeals to me strongly, as it does with many gamers, due to its direct ties with Bethesda's Elder Scrolls series. After spending roughly 50 hours in game, I can attest to several negatives and positives of this title though I endeavor to be brief. My primary critique so far (In being a veteran of MMO titles) is in the control system itself. To be clear.. I do not have a problem with their intended method, only that I am fairly locked down to that method barring the use of some unknown addon. I have always mapped abilities to either key-mouse combinations or to clickable macros in other MMO experiences, so I was upset (at first) that I could not click abilities or control their assignment past 6 predetermined keys. This was further agitated by my own preferences as, though I may be alone in this, I have never fancied using the number keys as shortcuts. I felt that this game forced this playstyle. HOWEVER, this leads me to my primary positive note: The control system itself. 'Wait.. but you said..' I know what I said, but I also pointed out that this was my initial feeling. I found, after around 20 hours, that Zenimax knew better than me how to provide a combat experience, and after avoiding my keyboard related griefs by using numbered mouse keys, I found myself thoroughly enjoying an experience that I had once dreamed about: The Elder Scrolls in a massive online setting, with no extended action bars to take away from the experience. Furthermore, the limited action bar spaces served in the end as their own brilliant mechanic, keeping (most) fights varied and fresh due to a requirement of resourcefulness in opposition to the lackluster buttonmashing of the many proc based abilities on other games' always visible action bars.\n\nI said I would keep it short, so I have. As I mentioned, I do have several pros and cons, but for the purpose of this being quick ( I am strapped for time at the moment) I will keep it simple with one + and one - sentiment.\n\nHowever I will leave you with this: I am a HUGE fan of lore, and I am in most games for their story, and the Elder Scrolls series is far from an exception. This game thus far has both elated and disappointed on this front. My disappointment has come in the form of inconsistancies pointed out by a respected youtuber, but KNOW THIS: Even though dialogue may sometimes be quick and the stories bring other lore into question, any good nerd can look past these bothers and see ESO for what it is: A  wonderful representation of the future of MMOs with thousands upon thousands of brilliantly voice acted lines that tell a fantastic story from a time in Elder Scrolls lore that we honestly dont know enough about to complain. Any piece of Tamriel that I can get in this format is fine with me. Overall I recommend, but know that due to a fairly limited number of complaints, I must hold it to a modest 8.5 out of 10.\n\n\n** continuation **\n\nA further complaint is with an almost pay-to-play environment. In lieu of most similar games allowing for a rested experience gain after logging out in taverns, cities, etc. ESO has provided smaller in-game gains such as the Ring of Mara (I would make a list but can literally think of no other example) with the largest gains only being available to those spending real world coin. I understand the necessity of money making in the business model, and it has to happen somewhere; however, there are no real alternitives for the players that cannot afford a subscription or random crown purchases. The primary experience boost is in the form of a consumable item available ONLY in the crown store. While there is the scroll's redeeming quality of persisting (and pausing) during logouts, this is an item that carries a real world price tag and lasts a measly 2 hours with a 50% boosted gain. WHAT?! A free system of doubled experience with a bar percentage limitation would be much more welcome. Take some notes from Blizzard, Zenimax, they have been in this 'game' a LONG time for a reason.\n\nDiscouragingly high in-game prices seem to further penalize players who keep responsible pocketbooks. I understand that this is an inflated economy where 1000g is easy to come by with a couple quests and a vendor selling spree, but almost 50k for a very basic mount? I do have other things to spend my coin on... Who wouldn't rather subscribe and buy a horse with their 'complimentary' crowns?\n\nOn a more positive note, this is NOT the worst system I have seen for microtransactions. Given the price of a subscription vs the real world price of crowns, it's actually quite fair as your subscription grants you access to otherwise paid content and an allowance of crowns that are roughly the value of your sub itself. For the gamer that is responsible with his or her wallet, this makes the previous complaint somewhat moot.\n\nNow let's address the things that keep me playing. Despite its questionable continuity and how easy it would be to miss when rushing to keep up with friends, the story is still, in my humble opinion, worthy of the series, and far superior in the MMO genre itself. If one takes the time to listen and follows the quests from area to area, he or she will discover a brilliant slew of voice actors backing up an intriguing story of enemies and alliances in a world that I personally can't get enough of.\n\nMeanwhile, the aforementioned combat system has grown on me and mixes extremely well with a concept that can't be praised enough: classless classes. In ESO you choose a class during character creation that, instead of locking you down to specific skills like most MMOs, provides you with a guideline for the type of hero that you wish the Vestige to be. Skill lines are divided between weapons, guilds, classes, and more. You really want to be an assassin that heals and is particularly brilliant with maces? Go for it.\n\nAnother bit of praise falls on just how good this game looks. Remember, you have to be fair; this is not a fully loadable file that you alone exist in like its single player brothers, this is a system that relies heavily on cached data and internet speeds to deliver a highly playable experience. With that in mind, to the people who say this game looks bad, and continues to compare it to a fully-modded Skyrim:  Have you ever played an MMO before? Do you understand what sacrifices must be made to make them playable by more than 1% of gamers? Finally, when exactly was the last time you actually played Skyrim?\n\nOk, ok, I get it. Some things could look better, but come on! The game looks beautiful with some truly breathtaking vistas! Don't be a troll!\n\nThis has merely been an addition of information to my existing review, not an alteration. The well earned recommendation remains:  8.5/10\n\n~Play with honor and namarie~","February 22","true","275.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I have no regrets in purchasing this game at all.\n\nHere's my list of Pros and Cons.  These are based on my opinion.\n\nPROS:\n\nYou move slowly enough through leveling (especially if you love to immerse yourself into the stories & not just speed through to your next quest objective) that it feels like the game could go on for forever, unlike some other MMO's I've played (not going to mention names).\n\nI've played a few different races so far and the main quest lines are the same (mages guild, fighter's guild and main quest line) but all the other quests are totally different, so you don't get bored starting a new character as a different race.  I can really appreciate that since I love to play alts. Yes, every pact has their own starting area as well (there's three in total).\n\nIf you like crafting you can do all that this game has to offer, you are not limited to choosing what your MO will be.  Your crafting materials can hang in the bank (which is shared between all of your characters) so you don't have to lug that stuff around.\n\nI do like the character creation, you can spend some time going through it all and perfecting your look, all very typical of ES games. You can even pick what voice you want your character to have, which is cool (and funny, if you imagine your character in the bathroom while you are picking your voice).\n\nYou can dye your armor, too (does not cost you a dime).\n\nYour quest rewards are not bound to you, so if they do not fit your character build, you can deposit them into your bank and an alt can pull it out and use it.  In fact, a lot of items you can put on and use are not bound to you unless you dye them.\n\nYou can wear costumes to hide your armor as well, if you want a different appearance.\n\nYou can play a lot of the game content solo, which is a big plus IMO.  I hate nagging guild members, complete strangers for help, or waiting till someone can help you before moving on in your quests (GAH!).\n\nThere is no lag at all in battle sequences.  You hit your #3 button (as an example), your attack assigned to 3 executes as expected.  Some f2p games do not have a great battle response time (lag) but ESO does not.\n\nThe button assignments are very similar (almost mirror image) of PC Skyrim.  I really appreciate that.  That also means, battles play out the same, but ESO does have a bit of a 'guidance' system with ranged attacks - specifically bows.\n\nThe talk sequences are so cool (and so like other ES games), it really makes this game more immersive.\n\nThe graphics are awesome!\n\nThey will be adding more guilds (thieves guild, etc.) in the future.\n\nCONS:\n\nSharing a bank with all your characters CAN be a negative.  You are limited on space, so sometimes you have to make tough decisions on what you want to hoard.  You can buy more bank space, it just gets pricey very quickly.\n\nYou are limited on how many guilds you can be in (some find that a negative), and all of your alts are in the same guilds your alts are in.  It is confusing.  Essentially, you are limited to being in 5 guilds, so guild chatter shows up in your feed from ALL the guilds you are in, they are just labeled g1, g2, g3, g4, g5 (you can color-code them, too).  At least you won't miss any juicy drama.  *shrugs*\n\nI have not joined a guild yet, but I did attempt to start my own guild to see if I could use it as a bank (500 slots, mind you - that is a lot of hoarding), but it requires ten people to unlock and your alts do not count even though they are automatically in your guild.\n\nYou can only have 8 characters in total (some find this a negative, that's why I put this here).\n\nYou cannot change your facial/body appearance after you leave character creation.\n\nMounts are not cheap.\n\nBuying additional bag and bank space is expensive (and yet, so necessary).\n\nThat's all I can really come up with!\n\nOverall, I feel this game is well worth the money to purchase and play.  I will be playing this game for many years to come.  The negatives - for me - do not outweigh the positives.\n\nThe only recommendation I have for those of you considering buying/playing ESO: Unlimited: buy the Imperial Edition if you can throw an extra 20 bones towards it.  I didn't and regret it.  The ability to buy a mount for one gold shortly after you start playing your new character verses thousands of gold pieces and many levels later is a bummer.  Yes, you can still buy that package deal through the crown store (their in-game cash store), but it just makes more sense to buy the edition that already has that built-in, because it is cheaper.","March 27, 2015","true","149.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The combat is fantastic and questing is a blast. The quest dialog is very well written and acted. It was a bit overwhelming at first honestly, but most MMOs are.

But now, after six updates and a crap ton of complaints, ESO is pretty damn fun.  The game plays similar to an MMO, while still maintaining mimicking an Elder Scrolls game.  You can walk into a town, steal everything, get caught and killed, then cry your eyes out.  Standard MMO skills exist within the game, and the hotbar doesn't feel to alien.  Yet even with an MMO class system and skills, you can still play the way you want.  All NPCs are voice-acted, which is pretty pleasing.  Crafting is amazing in the game, and a large array of armor and weapons exist.  The story is meh, but that's expected with an MMO.\n\nI have yet to delve into PvP, which I have heard is amazing.\n\nBut the game does fall short in some categories:\n-The auction system is horrifying.  No global auction house exists, only traders who sell a specific guild's items.  And also, you have to join a guild to sell your items in an auction.\n-The lack of player housing is a slight downfall, I would like to own my own home.  (But it's not exactly a must-have)\n-Armor is unbalanced.  Light armor has benefits that are vastly better than medium and heavy armor.  High rank players can easily surpass the armor value of veteran heavy and medium armor by wearing light armor and using certain perks.\n-Mages pls.  I thought tanks were plate-wearing sword-and-board wielding juggernauts, not a mage wearing light armor!?  (Then again, it is still viable to play a more traditional tank)\n\nOverall, I love this game.  And I will continue to enjoy it for a few years before I start hating the game for irrelevant reasons.\n11/10 too gud.","April 1, 2015","true","123.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It's now pretty much the perfect MMO - great character customisation, a huge mature world, masses of quests and dungeons, and the most amazing large-scale PvP to date.\n\nYes, you do have to pay a one-off fee, but there's no monthly subscription required, and you aren't continually being nagged to purchase stuff to play-to-win unlike some free MMOs.\n\nIt's also Mac-compatible, and unlike competitors like Guild Wars 2 it's true native code, not via an emulator, so it runs great on a MacBook. So if you're a Mac owner it's really a no-brainer choice.\n\nActually on any system it's a no-brainer choice.

It´s really flexible to do a really original build ive seen crazy builds like sorcerer healers or tanks etc it really lets you do really personalized stuff. AND NO not only that! when you reach end game you unlock a thing called Championship System where you unlock points every certain exp amount that you can allocate within a really wide skill tree that looks alike skyrim tree (theese are passive skills) to tweak your character to your own needs.\n\nDungeon wise it has a really big spam of dungeons around 15 or more dungeons each with unique boss fights and mechanics and around 10 more End game dungeons, 3 trials (raids), so its kinda hard to get bored specially on the endgame dungeons since they require skilled players to beat, also you have with the DLCs are big solo player Arena and a huge PVPVE map where you have a hybrid of story and pvp.\n\nTalking about PvE it has a really really big map where you fight for the dominance between the 3 factions available, with diferent mechanics, you can even use siege weapons to break down walls on Forts and so (i don´t wanna talk much about it because i dont wanna spoil the fun of seeing it for yourself).\n\nIn conclusion this game it´s a gem specially for thoose who are TES games fans, no its not a pure TES game but it uses a lot of it´s elements, and also players who just want to play a MMO can be delighted with it, specially if you are bored of the same usual MMO.","February 8","true","284.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","1"

There was also issues with combat and how weightless it feels and plenty of other minor problems.\n\nA lot of people also disliked it on its first release, and I can see why. When I played it on release, the game felt incredibly grindy, there were major balance issues and the weight of hitting ♥♥♥♥ hadn't been fixed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cdvever/recommended/306130/","cdvever","Dnyawa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cdvever/","92 products in account","Sort of revolutionary game in MMORPG genre. I could say it's not even MMORPG but just regular TES game slightly simplified for online. This game has all benefits that make us to love The Elder Scrolls: great plot, lore stories, world atmosphere. You are free to do everything you did in previous games and be whoever you wanna be. None of another popular MMO gаmes allow you to make role-playing desicions throughout completing quests, to be declared as a criminal or vice versa to bring the justice by yourself and punish thiefs and murderers for reward. Quests are not about killing tons of monsters (at least while you are low-level, I'm currently 10) but you should speak with NPCs and explore the world, even in dungeons you can just sneak through the enemies and complete the quest peacefully, still getting exp and level up. In sum, you can play TESO just like you did in Morrowind, Oblivion or Skyrim, with the exception of other players who play next to you. Because of that I wanna call this game 'Online RPG' not 'MMORPG'. In MMO like WoW etc you usually set your goal to level up faster, to reach level cap and be the strongest player on server, to get the best equip etc but in TESO I want to play slowly and relaxed, to read every lore book on my way and listen all the NPC's dialogues. Btw, how much MMO's have totally voiced dialogues? =) Just another score for TESO. So this is must-have game if you are the fan of TES series or just wanna try new experience in online games in spite of high price and quite low popularity among MMO players. 9/10 and strongly recommended.","December 2, 2015","true","60.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I honestly don't mind the mass amounts of questing you have to do, as all of the quests have voice acting which makes that much more immersive.  Aside from the quests, the other things you can do, such as the boss-camps, delves and just exploring in general, makes this game just that much more exciting to play.  And if that's not enough, there can always be surprise random events that can happen while in the open world.  I've been playing this game with my brother for the first 14 levels so far, and if playing the game isn't fun enough, playing with another person makes it all the better.\n\nGraphics: Oh my God, this game is beautiful.  If you can play this game on Ultra settings, you may need to put your eyes in a wheel chair.  As I said before, this is by far, the most beautiful game I've ever played.  Every province is something special, and the regions and zones inside of that province are a sight to see.  I've played mostly on the Pact, but I have given AD and DC a try, and all three factions are graphically promising and are all beautiful in one way or another.  The makers of this game did an amazingly stunning job with the graphics.  I've played maybe 20-25 hours so far (again, ignore what Steam says I've played), and I can't help but appreciate all the places I've gone through.\n\nCombat/Battle Mechanics: Very well done.  The use of dodging and actually having to move around while fighting makes this game a very good seller.  The mechanics for combat can make some very intense battles when fighting the bosses in Group Instances.\n\nClasses/Roles: One thing that's to be specified.  YOUR CLASS DOESN'T DETERMINE YOUR ROLE.  And that's perfectly fine with me.  You don't have to be a Dragon Knight to be Tank, or a Templar to be a Healer.  You can be a Sorcerer Tank or Nightblade Healer if you want.  You can use any weapon and any armor in this game!  Yep, Dragon Knights can use Destruction or Restoration Staves if they want to.  There is many many variations in this game.  You can be Nord Werewolf Templar with a Bow in Light Armor if you honestly want to do that.  Hey!  You can really be any class and not fight, and all you do is just make food and/or craft items!  It's all up to you!\n\nMiscellaneous: Crafting system is complex, but fair and makes sense after a while.  Cooking and Alchemy are a thing and are important to the gameplay.  There is a Justice System where you could become a fugitive (pick-pocket, murder, assault).  There is a lot of things I've covered but probably forgotten.  Don't stand in the fire!\nAt this point in time I haven't tried out the PvP yet, but I can only imagine it's fun as Hell.\n\nOverall Pros:\nBuy-to-Play: $60-80 Price Tag ($23.99 for the Christmas Sale!!, however there is an in game store for buying mounts and such.)\nGraphically Stunning\nExtremely Immersive\nFun to play with friends\nGood Combat System\nGraphically Stunning\nMain Storyline is compelling and very interesting\nA very rewarding game\nCrafting System is good\nJustice System makes the game very diverse and fun.\nRoleplayer friendly\nDialogue and voice acting are great!\nDid I forget to mention the graphics?\nExtremely large game\nNothing in this game really pisses me off\n\nOverall Cons:\nIt's definitely not your typical Elder Scrolls Game\n\nOverall Overalls:\nAgain, not your typical Elder Scrolls Game, but that doesn't bother me at all.  Definitely not bragging, but being a player of this series for 5 years now, TES games definitely leave a mark in the RPG world and are definitely unique to other games.  Although Bethesda and Zenimax had to take ESOTU a slightly different direction, this game is still fun as Hell.  I definitely see myself playing this for a long time, and maybe making another review.  And if it really matters, I've never made a review for any game before (Please ignore the amount of games I have too, I was sharing a Steam account for the longest time before branching out to games like ESO), but I have to say, with the 20-25 hours I've spent so far, I really just had to get this review out there.\nLastly, I highly recommend this game to everyone.  I believe that TES players will enjoy this alot, and MMO players will enjoy it as well.  Get it before the sale ends!\nThanks for reading!","December 27, 2015","true","0.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Further more Angry Joe's review showed that the game did not live up to the franchise name Elder Scrolls that this game was released under.\n\nA couple days ago I finally bit the bullet and purchased the game. This game is AMAZING! Do not make the mistake of expecting it to be exactly like Skyrim with a multiplayer option like I did. It feels like a MMO in some ways, and in others you can clearly see influences from great titles like the above mentioned Skyrim. A great example of this is in my adventures I came across a chicken, of course we all know what to do with a chicken in an Elder Scrolls game. I proceeded to kill the chicken. because of that action immediately afterwards I was killed by the guards. That is proof of a true Elder Scrolls game right there! This game has benefited greatly from the build up of fantastic game mechanics and lore with everything else that has made the Elder Scrolls series win\nGame of the Year awards many times.\n\nWe have covered where the game came from and where it is today. What about game mechanics? How does the game play? The answer is it plays surprisingly smooth. The regions your character travels through are huge! The land well populated with quest givers of all sorts, a great variety of different kinds of quests. The quests vary from serious to hilarious, at one moment you will be saving the world and at the next you are looking for a pig named Glutton in to settle a dispute between two business owners. I could keep on going about everything this game does right.\n\nWhat about the Cons? What does this game do wrong? There are no perfect games, they all have problems. My primary complaint with ESO is everything you buy in the game whether from the Crown Store or purchasing items from merchants is ridiculously expensive. You earn gold very slowly, the majority coming from quest rewards. Things like this are more than slightly in your face saying buy the Imperial Edition, Buy Gold, Buy Crowns, all with real money. I completely understand having mounts and outfits for sale in a store for real money. That is what MMOs do. But the merchant prices as well? That is over the top. In my 8.5 hours of game play I have earned 1,500.00 gold from selling items, killing creatures and the majority from quest rewards. An example of how much items cost is a basic bow is going run you about 1,100.00 gold, a basic horse is 10,000.00 gold. You do have the option to purchase a horse form the Crown Store for 900 Crowns, you are given 500 Crowns at the beginning of the game.\nAnd of course Crowns cost real money.\n\nEverything included like the other reviewers are saying the positives far out way the negatives. In my mind this title is a must buy.\n\n-GhillieBear","July 7, 2015","true","202.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

Now I've watched Angry Joe (he reviews videos and talks about them in a somewhat angry manner "hint the name") but this is one of his reviews that I disagree with.  He stated that the game was boring and very cookie cut MMORPG exsperince, but in truth it is anything but.  Most games would have you go kill 10 spiders and then turn in the quest.  However, ESO (Elder Scrolls Online) is vastly different.  While killing those said 10 spider, you may find a letter in one of the stomach of the pests, telling you of a soldier who feel victim to a spider attack, it would tell you to return that letter to his family.  Only to find out that the family has gone missing and they have been captured by a Cult.  A cult whom worships a spider demon as a god. You destory the cult members and their deity and in the process you put all the dead spirts to rest. Quests like this is why ESO is truly amazing and one of a kind.\n\n\nTldr; game quests are good you should feel good by playing it.","March 29, 2015","true","93.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I was skeptical at first, as I'd heard all the bad press around it's launch last year and I didn't know how it had moved on. I did a little bit of research and found the general consensus was "things have changed for the better try it" I'm now 15hours or so in and I am thoroughly enjoying it. Of course I bought it for the MMO side, but the "single player" RPG style is brilliant. The content I've played so far is well worth the £50 I have spent and what's better is that there's no subscription fee. In my opinion, a must have for Elder Scrolls fans.\n\nPros:\n\n-Great story with interesting side quests and detail to characters\n-All quests and NPCs have audio, the voice acting is actually a lot better than Skyrim and previous TES titles too\n-Beautiful landscape\n-Large world, covering the vast continents of Tamriel\n-Involving and meaningful character progression, each skill point seems to matter\n-No subscription, so if you need a break, simply put it down\n-Beautiful soundtrack\n-Crafting is actually decent throughout, with access to crafting easy enough and crafted armour/weapons better than quest\n\nCons:\n\n-Large disk space. I think it's around 60gb, not too much trouble nowadays but watch out.\n-Quests seem to be very easy early on\n-No real scope for group play/levelling with friends in PvE (15hours in) You seem to speed past it even faster\n-They give you 60 bank space har har! This is a TES game, we are all horders!\n\nI would very much reccomend the game based on what I've played so far. I very much look forward to the PvP towards the end game, which I haven't had chance to sample yet. However the PvE questing content so far has been well worth the money.\n\nGive it a go!\n","March 31, 2015","true","82.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I'm going to do my best not to spoil it, but I can't make any promises.\n\nLet's start off with the things I didn't like about the game...\n(Please note I am a mac user, so any software/hardware bugs I report are mac only, or local only.)\n\n• Lots of loading screens, and some can take 30-60 seconds. (recently fixed and shortened for windows and mac users)\n• Changes to character skins and armour dyes can take a while to take effect, making character customization rather annoying.\n• HUGE FILE DOWNLOAD, I'm afraid if your internet is not good, it'll be a while before you can play the game, although I do recommend learning a bit about the game in that time.\n\nNow onto the great things about the game...\n\n• Amazing Quest storyline, especially in the Orsinium/Wrothgar DLC\n• Once you progress with Dolmens, the bosses can be dragons, so.. YES YES YES YES YES! (Not actually too sure how the dolmen system works, but I have fought a dragon with a huge group of players.)\n• Extremely friendly community, scared you won't fit in with the masters of Tamriel? Wrong. While just like every community there's a toxic player or... dozens... Elder Scrolls Online isn't so. I have yet to see a disrespectful player within the game, nor have I ever been scammed. Also growing as a player zone chat was always there for me, and the nice players behind it!\n• Beautiful graphics and world design.\n• Entertaining Dungeons and Group Activities.\n• Not buy to win, there's hardly anything in the "Crown Store" that can be buy to win, so if you don't feel like spending your money to win, then you're in luck!\n• Great character customization, and build options.\n\nCould go on, but I have to go take care of my guild! Please rate up the review if you found it entertaining, or helpful! Thank you!

I really did like Skyrim, and heard this wasn't exactly the same, but similar.\n\nI am pleasently suprised. Great combat system. You got the whole hack and slash like Skyrim then hot keys for your spells. Makes you feel like a battle mage. I always hated how much you had to switch your equoment around in Skyrim and this game fixes that issue I had.\n\nYou still get the same feel of doing what you want and leveling up for it instead of just spending points on skills for leveling. Really gives you an option to try new things. For each class there is a few routes you can take for it, and you can use whatever weapon you want for it. Basically you get to play the character you want to play instead of feeling stuck into a role. You also get rewarded for playing your hand to hand combat skills which I like. It's not just a bunch of clicking on hot keys.\n\nThe quests are nice and comparable to Skyrim as well. There is stories that fit into the lore, and avoid doing the whole collect this many or kill this many creatures.\n\nGraphics are pretty nice as well.

Would have bough this game a long time ago had it not been p2p. Tamriel Unlimited definitely deserves the title of an elder scrolls game. For those of you who are considering buying it as your first elder scrolls game, I would still recommend Skyrim.\nJust keep in mind that this is NOT Skyrim Multiplayer! The dynamics are that of an MMO, for example instead of buying spells, you unlock them like you do in other mmos and mmorpgs. The story is amazing and the side-quests are awesome. The only problem is when you are supposed to be sneaking into a house and there are other people just standing there because they are at a later stage of a quest. But this is just nitpicking and I enjoy the game.","April 21, 2015","true","283.0"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EnigmaTNG/recommended/306130/","EnigmaTNG","EnigmaTNG","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EnigmaTNG/","734 products in account","This game is so good.\nIt's basically The Elder Scrolls Skyrim except it's online with other people, and much, much larger, literally. I'm not going to compare this to an MMORPG like World of Warcraft because I feel they are two completely different games, regardless of them being in the same category. I feel this game is catering more so to people who are fans of The Elder Scrolls series such as Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim.\n\nConsidering those games were single player I think what Zenimax / Bethesda did here is amazing, because they made it so that the game is balanced for fans who want to play by themselves, as well as people who like to run around with others. Personally I like to play by myself for the most part, so this game works out great for me because I hate MMO's that force you to play with other people. Considering this is an "Elder Scrolls" game, being able to do nearly everything by myself was highly expected. People who are hardcore MMORPG fans will probably get tired of this in like 5 seconds, because I guess in many ways this game really isn't bringing anything new to the table, but I personally don't feel this game was aimed at those "MMO elitists" anyways. This is a really addicting game, if you're an Elder Scrolls fan like me I think you'll like this. The game can be a bit repetitive with the fetch quests here and there, but that's to be expected in games like this right? It's not that bad though, and besides, I think these side stories are kinda' interesting. What's cool to me is that all the characters in the entire game world have voice acting. I appreciate the effort put into that. Makes the world seem a little more immersive. The combat can be 1st person and up in your face, or 3rd person, which is great.\n\nP.S\nI had an old friend that couldn't understand why I liked ESO so much when there were others such as WoW, WildStar, etc. He said I like this game because I didn't know any better. To this day I'm still trying to find a fukk to give.....","February 1","true","218.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","1"

The game was unoptimized and the story felt uninspiring. It didn't quite feel like Elder Scrolls nor did it feel like a meaningful MMO.\n\nI played the release and it was horrible. Many of the bugs that plagued the Beta were still present. Not only that, but there was a monthly fee attached to the game which coerced me into rushing through content in hopes of reaching the maximum level.\n\nAnd now, we have the buy-to-play version; Tamriel Unlimited. It seems like Zenimax have found the right balance. I don't feel rushed into completing stories anymore. Anyways, onto the review.\n\nI can't believe how great the game has become. Zenimax introduced a new justice system that allows you to kill non-story NPC's, rob their homes and pickpocket people. They introduced a bounty system along with that. In first person mode, it really feels like an Elder Scrolls game now. Wandering the in-game world also gives off that ES vibe.\n\nWherever you choose to go in the game world, there are books and events that will continue to keep you entertained, just like the singleplayer experience. If you play the game with an open mind for an MMO, you will fall in love with it (and I'm an MMO veteran). There is a lot of content here; there are 3 factions and each faction has their own storyline and maps that you can explore. Each map is the size of, say, 3 zones in Guild Wars 2.\n\nThis game has made me reminiscent of Runescape back in the day. There are a bunch of skills you can level up and you can go about your business in any way you choose. Feel like harvesting wood and building things today? Have at it. Feel like fishing and selling your wares in town? Go for it. There are no set paths and you can pick up and complete any quest you choose. You don't feel pushed to do quests like in other MMO's. Levelling doesn't really feel like levelling if you're looking to take your time with the game.\n\nAs a Star Wars the Old Republic fan, I will say that the in-game stories aren't as detailed as the aforementioned. The stories are on-par with that of Skyrim, however. They're simple but interesting.\n\nNow time for the flaws with this MMO. Like any other MMO, there is always a flaw with the game. I personally didn't experience any bugs whatsoever and I'm 10 hours in. The game itself DOES feel like an MMO; it doesn't have that personal touch that singleplayer ES games give you. If you save a town, people will cheer you on - however talking to individual NPC's won't net you any rewards. I remember some guy saying he'd buy the person who saved the King some ale but when I spoke to him, he just said, "Yeah?" Needless to say, I killed him.\n\nThis new version of the game gets a solid 8/10. Zenimax seems to only profit from expansions now which is fine by me; as long as they keep the same quality as the vanilla version, I'd happily purchase them. The Elder Scrolls Online is now a great MMO with even more content than Guild Wars 2. I highly doubt they're done with it yet.","July 26, 2015","true","111.4"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","1"

I am kind of sorry I did.\nHopefully it will get a bit cheaper in the future, then maybe it’s worth it. 60 bucks plus subscription fees seems too much.\n\nIf you get a deal on it for around 30 i would say its reasonable, and if you don't mind paying the subscription.\nFee to play would only make the game follow in the footsteps of so many mmo's that failed so i for one like that it has a subscription. That gives hope that the game will be getting updates and is being expanded.\n\nSo kind of a mixed recommendation here,\nIf you like the elder scrolls and want to explore the lands go ahead but don't expect skyrim with mmo aspects in it. it feels a lot more like morrowind to me when you play it after having played skyrim for days. kind of clunky but it still has some interesting things. The landscape looks interesting but like all mmo scattered with baddies that respawn after a while which only gets annoying after your pack is full and you just want to get back to a store and sell up.\n\noverall i have to say no, mainly because of the price of the game versus the actual game that you get. it's a subscribed game so they wouldn't need to jack the price that high since if you want to keep playing it you will keep paying them. but that is my opinion.\n\nHave fun either way.","July 28, 2014","false","16.5"," 62 of 115 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","62","115","0","0"

I was told by customer support, over Reddit, that the problem I was experiencing had already been solved. Then I was ignored. Why was I receiving customer support over Reddit you ask? Because I had absolutely no way to contact their customer support by any other means, except Facebook and Google+, I took the lesser of three evils and tried Reddit.\n\nHonestly they genuinely believe the issue is solved, even though dozens of people are contacting them via Facebook, Google+, and Reddit. I've seen six Facebook wall posts there by people describing the same problem as me all posted after the EOS rep replied to me on Reddit. ( https://www.reddit.com/user/ZOS_GinaBruno )\n\nHere is the response I received.\n\n"Was the issue that you guys aren't receiving your one-time passwords? If so, we did have an issue with them over the weekend, but has since been resolved. If there's something else going on, though, please let us know."\n\nFirst thing wrong with that is that she stated "over the weekend". I can see reports on their Facebook of the problem occuring a couple weeks ago, and after searching online I'm seeing reports of it fairly consistently for about three weeks now.\n\nSo the issue itself is that I'm being told I need a confirmation email to login to the game, and their support forums. I'm able to login to the main website, but the main website is just the game store essentially, and your account information. To access their customer support you have to visit a different website that requires you to login separately. Also worth noting is that I am using the correct email, I've received one confirmation email when I first set my account up, I think that's why I can access the main website, because that's where I entered the confirmation code. There's nothing in my spam folder, I'm familiar with computers in general and am not experiencing issues like this anywhere else.\n\nThey provide no other means of contacting their customer service other than by being logged in to that customer service website. That means that if you need customer service in order to regain access to your account, you're completely 100% ♥♥♥♥ out of luck. That to me is the main issue at play here, not the confirmation email issue.\n\nJust the way that the one response I finally did get was so dismissive of it, because it was on their social media they obviously had to "get ahead of it" and make it seem like the problem was already gone... Instead of actually trying to determine exactly what the problem was, and whether it was fixed...\n\nAnyways I can't recommend this game to anyone, I've been talking with a few other people on Facebook who I've seen posting on their Facebook wall, we're all incredulous that this can even happen. I mean I've never experienced anything even close to this in over twenty years of gaming on a PC, and I've dealt with some pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ companies.\n\nIf this was a new game I could understand it, new games have kinks that need to be worked out. This game is over two years  old, these systems they have in place are there for a reason. It's easier on their customer service if they don't receive random messages, I get that, but the idea that someone will never ever ever run into issues with accessing their account is asanine. That's what they're relying on with the system they have in place.\n\nLuckily for me I was able to get a refund even though I technically had two hours played, which was just the ESO launcher downloading a bunch of updates and patching them.","February 9","false","88.6"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","14","23","0","2"

Many of Elder Scroll's signature features         (pick-pocketing, sneaking, lock-picking, etc.) exist in this MMO.\n\nHowever, one of the few things I'm not a huge fan of is being limited to 5 spells/abilities on your castbar. This technially exceeds to 10 upon reaching level 15, where you can switch out an alternate set of weapon(s) and spells. However, despite being limited to 5 spells, the game pulls it off.\n\nTESO provides technially no limitations to players who don't subscribe to a monthly fee. While subscribers get all DLC with their game, non-subscribers can easily just purchase each individual DLC, and even purchase bundles of said DLC with some little extra goodies.\n\nThe microtransactions (Crown Store) are mostly cosmetic, with of course the optional purchase of DLC/Expansions included in the Crown Store, and very few items that actually help with gameplay (Such as purchasing extra bag space for real money, or purchasing experience boosts, and "Crafting Motifs" which allow for the skill to craft specific racial armor styles) Some may argue the Crown Store is ridiculous; it's really not. Everything in the Crown Store that is not cosmetic can be earned in-game without real purchase. (Experience boosts being the exception)\n\nThe game so far has provided plenty of content to satisfy my $60 purchase, and that's just in the first 15 levels of the game in one area of the entire map. There are still plenty more zones and levels and quests to accomplish beyond that, and then there are the expansion packs.\n\nThis game is not just a generic MMO with Elder Scrolls slapped onto it, and if you're looking for an MMO to get into, I strongly recommend this one.","February 10","true","249.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

However, I will be really strict with this one.\n\nStarting off, the game's graphics are top notch. Finding a game with better visuals or at least in the same quality, will be very difficult. From the snowy mountains and hills of Skyrim and the dark, ash-ridden plains of Morrowind to the sand of the Hammerfell deserts and the forests of Cyrodiil, the game portrays Tamriel faithfully and as realistically as possible, with every Province being unique and filled with dungeons to explore, dolmens, towns and cities, group dungeons or solo dungeons, grinding areas etc. You will not be bored exploring the maps for resources, quests or mobs to farm (especially if you like exploring worlds in MMOs to satisfy your visual appetite). That said, some regions like High Rock might feel repetitive (too many forests man) but overall, it's a nice experience, one of a kind.\n\nThe soundtrack has its highs and lows, in some areas you won't even notice the music, but in some others (like group dungeons and dolmens) the sense of epicness will be a major boost to your fighting spirit, filling you with thrills of enjoyment as you charge against daedra or undead with a bunch of teammates. It tends to get repetitive some times though, and that's a minus.\n\nGameplay is pretty well-made. Leveling your skills and attributes as well as choosing and crafting your gear is totally free to your choice, and you don't have to be restricted to a single way of playing (e.g. warriors can use restoration staffs or rogues using two-handed battle axes). How you play your character is entirely up to you and anything can work. That doesn't mean some things don't work better than others, becoming a huge drawback or plus to your character (e.g. a tank with a mage's staff is less useful and strong than a tank with a sword and shield). However, the freedom to play as you want is unparalleled.\n\nPvP can be one of the most fun things to do in this game to one of the most boring ones. Sometimes, it's very difficult to find groups for sieges (maybe it's my fault due to the hours I log in), but the feel of tens of your teammates working together to take down a fort and charging through a breach is one of the best I have ever felt in any MMO I've played. The constant struggle of the alliances trying to take control of Cyrodiil makes for some interesting events, from massive sieges and minor skirmishes in the wilderness to hunting players that stole your elder scroll and ambushes while you are trying to take down neutral zone bosses.\n\nUnfortunately, the game has several drawbacks. Visual bugs like being stuck in third person after dismounting are not so often and destructive as you think, but they can be annoying. UI needs some work (e.g. the experience bar doesn;t pop out in-game, forcing you to bring up your character screen most times and the bank needs to be closed and re-open in you want to transfer items). But ZOS is constantly improving the bad aspects of the game, so I have hopes these things will be fixed as well.\n\nWhen it comes to the story, the quests given are interesting and you will enjoy immersing yourself to their story. The choices you make won't affect much their storyline (e.g. if you tell a dunmer girl her deceased fiancee never loved her, she will commit suicide and find her ghost wandering, while if you tell her something else, she will go home). The outcomes of your choices are only for cosmetic reasons, but it's a nice way to see the work they put up for them. The main story is mediocre to good, a fight to reclaim your soul against a Daedric Lord, stopping his plot to take Tamriel in the way. A bit generic, but not badly written, so it's pretty ok.\n\nMost important thing, the game is NOT pay to win. You get your occasional experience boost scrolls and bank space upgrades from the store with real money (you can buy some upgrades with in-game money too), but beyond leveling faster than others, there's nothing else to distinguish a player that doesn't want to purchase anything from a player that constantly buys things from the crown store. And that's a big plus.\n\nTL:DR (and overall) it's a great game that ZOS is constantly updating, making it better and more fun. Look beyond some bugs and miscellaneous things that should have been implemented but are not (yet), and you will get an excellent and enjoyable Elder Scrolls experience with many hours to spend in your questing and sieges.","February 25","true","272.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Smooth controls (plays great with a controller), decent graphics (doesn't look much different to Skyrim at it's highest), great musical score (pretty much expected for any Elder Scrolls game) and... I really like it!\n\nI feel like I'm actually playing a real Elder Scrolls game that happens to have multiplayer enabled, sometimes I legitimately forget I'm playing online for how smooth it plays, also with little to no lag.\n\nIf you're not sure if you'll like it, play the trial and/or get this at a discount, I was extremely skeptical at first for how poorly it was recieved at launch, but now it's just incredibly enjoyable.\n\nBesides, no subscription is always a great thing to have.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!","March 15","true","16.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I had hoped for "multi-player Skyrim", but all I heard was people complaining about the game. Maybe it was considerably worse at release; all I know is that I love how the game is now. Is it perfect? No - it's a Bethesda game after all! But... it really is multi-player Skyrim. The quest system is enhanced, it's entirely possible to ignore other people and have a great single-player experience. But if you get in over your head, there are other PCs around who can help out. I really like the PvE areas. The PvP areas are much more difficult, as you'd expect from a game that's been out for, what, nearly 2 years now? But even though PvP can be frustrating, it never really is not-fun.\n\nI loved Skyrim, and I really like the direction this game has gone. Deeper quests, lots of good voice acting and backstory to the quests and good graphics that seem well optimized. My only real cons are lag when lots of other PCs are in your "area", some quirky quests and lots (LOTS!) of disk space consumed. But overall, I really like the game and recommend it completely.","January 26","true","411.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I don't play a lot of ORPGs, I have too many games to play to play one for longer than a week or two. Also, I hate the auto-attack combat and the boring, genocidal quest lines (Kill 5 rats, kill 10 boars, etc) that most ORPGs use. ESO, however, has improved a lot over the past year, has a better feeling combat system and quests that are more interesting than kill # (insert animal here).\n\nI played ESO in the beta and despite some flaws, I liked it. I'm not a fan of subscriptions so I never played it past the beta or went back. When I heard it went with a one time purchase model, I decided to give it another whirl. Here's some quick pros (+) and cons (-):\n\n+I enjoy the combat. It's more involved than auto-attacking and just feels better. However, being an online game it's not 100% skill based and it's basically auto-aim turned up.\n+The quests are story based. No more killing 10 wolves in that field and then killing 15 dire wolves in another field right afterwards. You start off thwarting assassinations, finding lost colleagues in ruins or helping a family with a drug problem. You're given choices to help or kill and while sure, these are one time decisions with no real impact and some mission objectives get samey, it's still far better (in my opinion, anyways) than genocidal 'kill X amount of X' quests.\n+I like how the skills work, separating your class from your weapon so you can use whatever weapon you want with whatever class you want. I like how the skills level up from use and you're given the option to alter it by choosing one of two paths.\n-I find it odd how combat skills will get xp for just being in your bar and not from using them. Also, more 'morph' choices would be nice to better differentiate characters.\n-Game likes to boot me to the login screen randomly. Doesn't happen frequently enough to frustrate me but it can get annoying while playing with friends.\n+The game looks good. Even on medium the graphics are pretty good.\n+It maintains the TES feel of being able to go in any one direction and coming across quests or cool locations at random.\n+The world itself looks good. Ruins, villages, swamps, forests all look good and are worth exploring.\n+The crafting system, after a quick primer it's easy to start making your own equipment.  Plus the equipment you make can be as good as what you find, at least to a certain point, since I'm not at the endgame I can't say for sure at that point.\n-You seem to be given almost too much freedom with building your character. Current you can get 300+ skill points which is more than enough to get every skill you want, including crafting skills meaning potentially, one character could craft, upgrade and enchant their own weapons and armour while still being able to produce their own potions and food.\n+/- The new justice system is a mixed bag, allowing you to steal or kill but be caught as in other TES games. It's the beginning of what could be an interesting system depending on how far they take it.\n\nOverall I enjoy the game, I think it's managed to separate itself from other MMORPGs and not be considered a 'theme park' ORPG.\n","March 30, 2015","true","221.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's either "an amazing game" or "a terrible game, not like Skyrim at all". And I think that those who dislikes the game was looking for Skyrim with friends, something that this game would never be (they said from the start that it was going to be an MMO, and that exactly what they gave us). The ones that like the game was looking for an MMO, and this game is a unique type of MMO.\nI hear people say that this isn't Skyrim online, I'm here to tell you that they are right. It's so much more!\nThis game has the gates of Oblivion with the Sigil Stones ans Scamps that follows with it, Ayleid Ruins with traps and Welkynd Stones and the Shivering Isles with Haskill and Sheogorath. If you ever played Oblivion, then this game holds a bunch of nostalgia for you. I couldn't stop laughing when I fist saw Haskill, all I could think about was the Summon Haskill spell you get from the Shivering Isles quest line in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.\nThis game also contains the Dwemer Ruins with the Dwarven Spiders and the Dwarven Spheres, the old dragon burial mounds and the Nordic Ruins with Draugrs and puzzles. Almost everything you can do in The Elders Scrolls V: Skyrim, you can do in this game. And you can do a whole lot that you can't do in Skyrim.\nThis game has content from all of the Elder Scrolls games, but I have only played Oblivion and Skyrim so that's all I know :P\nIf you are looking for Skyrim online, you're not going to find it here.

I love stories. I love rememberable characters, both on and off the PC. I have tried several MMO's, and have enjoyed very few of them past 10 hours of gameplay and usually quit soon after from boredom. More so, I hate subscriptions. I hate the very concept. If I buy a game, I should own it.\n\nSo it was a great surprise to fall completely in love with Elder Scrolls Online (Tamreil Unlimited). Is it Skyrim Online? No, it is 10 x Skyrims. Maybe more? With nearly 50 hours under my belt, I have barely scratch the surface of the true shear enormity of the game. Each Alliance starts out at a different part of Tamriel (the game's world), with very different story quests, and unique characters. So even if you make a Nord and a Redguard, you will get a completely new experience with each character.\n\nThe controls are vastly different from Skyrim. Perhaps the consol  versions will be more similar to the previous games, but for the PC you map 5 powers on the number line and a "Nova" power with the Q key. Performing sneak, pickpocket, and lock picking are all still available in game. Characters are allowed to sell up to 50 items to a fence a day (upgrading the limit is available through the skill tree).\n\nUnlike the previous Elder Scrolls, you choose a class at character creation. Each class is quite versatile and has access to all the armors, weapons, crafting, and magical staffs. Just because you choose a Templar, doesn't mean you have to play the group's main healer. You can be a Dragon Knight who sneaks around and snipes enemies from above, raining down a fiery destruction, or a Nightblade who charges headfirst into battle with heavy armor and a giant axe, invisible one moment and cleaving enemies in two the next. The choice is yours. Though some classes are obviously built better for certain styles of combat then others.\n\nOne of ESO's greatest strengths is the ever changing world. If you save a king, each time you go back to that city you hear NPCs call out to as that hero. If you remove the curse of a ghostly army, the army becomes peaceful and the gloom lifts. On the other hand, It can be a little strange if you have completed a quest that changed the area and some in your group hasn't. They may start attacking peaceful spirits or pouring potions on a seemingly dull rock. For the most part this doesn't diminish the atmosphere.\n\nOne of the biggest bonuses for me in ESO, is the ability to play it solo if I want. I have never had to join, or felt like I needed to, a group in order to beat a quest. In fact, the shear ability to do the whole thing solo makes helping random other players all the more purposeful. If all you want game with big groups however, ESO has the Alliance War function. The best part of this PvP  function is that you feel like you haven't left the rest of the game. If you are familiar with Oblivion, you might even see some familiar sites in the unbelievably massive map.\n\nWith very few bugs and next to no loading time between any area, its a little hard to pin down a poor function of this game. You can even add your own mods from Nexus to the MMO. There is a built in function for player add-ons!\n\nThe bottom line is: If you want a MMO, get Elder Scrolls Online. If you want an RPG, get Elder Scrolls Online. If you want a good game with memorable NPCs and amazing stories, get Elder Scrolls Online. Despite my effort, I don't enjoy many MMOs, but I love this game. No matter what kind of gamer you are, I'm betting you will too.","April 16, 2015","true","117.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

So, don't expect to play like you would on it. I'd also suggest finding friends who play, as teams, while not vital, will often prove more useful then anything else. Maybe, the tank and support. Or, close range, and distance, the usual run of the mill RPG sterotypes.\n\nThe game looks and feels like you'd expect. Not all of Tamriel is explorable like we were lead to believe. But, this is still, a pretty sizable map. I'm not saying there's as much stuff as the Oblivion, or Skyrim map, but still, pretty sizable. Lots to see and do while still new to the game.\n\nI did a lot of, let's call it "research" before I bought it. I'd suggest the same. It'll take a fair amount of time to get anywhere (progession wise). And if you play like me, only a few hours at a time, I can only imagine this game will take me a while to fully enjoy.\n\nDo your homework before you buy. Always. I myself don't really trust game reviews, like IGN or Gameinformer, as everybody elses ideal mmorpg is vastly different. The quests, admittedly are a bit... average. Go here, kill these, report back. Go here, collect this, come back. Go there and report to that one dude. That's the quests. But, meh.

The combat is the best in the series, i went back and tried to play Skyrim and Oblivion and the combat feels like you are just slicing at paper compared to this. I bought this game about a week ago and I've almot put 40 hours into it, which has been all of my free time. Every night I keep playing until I look at my clock and say to myself "oh ♥♥♥♥ its 4am" which hasnt happen to me with a game since Legend of Zelda. There is SO MUCH LORE for you to delve into you could spend hours just reading things around the world if you wanted to. The quests for the most part are way better than Skyrim's thank god, everything you do feels like it has a purpose. The graphics are superb for an mmorpg in my opinion and I only play on medium with long draw distance, there are some technical glitches here and there with textures and other players' characters not appearing for a long time but nothing game breaking. I have yet to play pvp because I'm scared so I have no comment on that yet. My ONE gripe with this game is more of a personal one with me being an indecisive ♥♥♥♥♥ it took me 5 characters to find the perfect race/class build.

The play style is very different compared to them, and yet it does not feel like your average MMO either. There is something far more immersive about it, and although as with any MMO you definitely have to invest many hours to rise through the levels, it doesn't exactly feel grindy either. True, as of the writing of this review I have not quite invested thirty hours yet (and I'm impatient to get to level 15 so that I can use the weapon swap system), but so far I haven't had to go out and grind monsters for hours in order to get a special item or enough experience to level up. I have several quests in my journal, but many seem to be actually thought out and you feel as though you are participating in an actual story instead of killing x goblins and y bandits in order to "thin the ranks" of creatures that are just going to respawn.\n\nAll in all, I think I actually enjoy this game more that I do Oblivion, and I would recommend it to any fan of the Elder Scrolls, as long as they go in knowing that they are not playing "Skyrim With Friends."","September 1, 2015","true","125.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Worth the money."\n\nAt first, I hate this game. When it first launched back in 2014, I hated this game simply because it kinda uses the oblivion engine. Combat is robotic, facial expressions are also not too realistic, and the overall graphics are oblivion-ish. For someone who came from an ultra modded Skyrim, this game sucks. However, after the major update that this game has offered, the overall experience turns around to a beautiful, lifelike gameplay. Facial expressions are fixed, gameplay fluidity is improved, combat is improved, and the graphics are easy to get used to and is quite forgiving, while I constantly remid myself that this is a MMORPG and graphics needs to be safrificed for better speed and connections. DLCs and loads of customizations further sweeten the experience, and while they dont come in for free, purchasing one is not obligatory and you still get tons of beautiful and breathtaking content that this game offers once you click the pay button.\n\nGive this game a try.

You end up in somewhat comical situations - like replacing a young noble's servant's soul with that of a ghost you run into while trying to rescue artifacts for her. You have several situations where you have to choose who lives and who dies - or if you give someone their sanity or walk away with a tome of knowledge...\n\nBeyond that you have a fairly larger MMO world with plenty to do and plenty to explore. Skyshards help you build out your character and you dig search for them everywhere. You can help the Mage's guild by exploring and finding books and lore. You can build experience by stealing and pick-pocketing. If you're a serious MMO player, ESOTU is well worth the investment due to the sheer volume of content available to you. And even if you're a one-toon kind of person, you will still have the opportunity to touch *all* of the main-line PVE content.\n\nIn PVP and the new Orsinium DLC, your level scales so you can join your guildmates who may be at a higher level.\n\nSome considerations to keep in mind:\n:: Inventory management is a game of its own - pack-rats looters have been warned\n:: Join an active trading guild - with no conventional auction-house, you still need to move your goods lest your bank and bags are always at 100%\n:: The game is, for the most part, fairly easy. However you *will* run into at least one, possibly two, quests where it can be Dark-Souls-smash-controller-rage-quit difficult - it will be a wtf?!?! moment given that it isn't even the final boss when you run into it.\n:: If you like to explore, the interface is pretty bare-bones. If you like to be a completionist, be sure to get addons to give you a heads-up if you've missed stuff. In fact, get addons regardless because they make the game that much more enjoyable\n:: If you find that you tend to spend money on DLC and/or experience/inventory boosters, consider the subscription service. DLC comes with the subscription and you get Crowns to spend in the Crown store monthly (or at the beginning of the pay period you choose to subscribe to)\n:: Imperial edition isn't neccessary. It gives you a couple of perks - a horse and the imperial race which can join any faction at creation.\n\n","December 9, 2015","true","954.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Alukirrillo/recommended/306130/","Alukirrillo","Aluku","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Alukirrillo/","39 products in account","Well, here I go again making another review. This time for The Elder Scrolls Online.\n\nWell, As freakish fan of the saga I have to say, I was afraid that a MMO experience would ruin a TES game. But fortunately, this is not the case. However, there are a few displeasing details, like some combat physics and such. But they are not really important.\n\nWell, they did it. They actually managed to unite TES and MMO in one single game, with a good result and with a good balance in the components. It feels that way to me\n\nRewarding exploration, delving dungeons, blacksmithing, enchanting, sneak upon your mobs, block the enemy attacks with your shield, jump over the mountains without following a single road, Public and group instances, Lots and lots of Skill trees, Guilds, PvP, sieges. Main quest and LOTS of side quests. You mention it, ESO has all the ingredients of both TES and ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes to offer. And you can play it the way you want.\n\nHowever, there are some dissapointing features such as no horseback combat (Which was avaliable even in TES II: Daggerfall and TES V: Skyrim). I think not allowing PK or PVP other players outside Cyrodiil is a total success for the experience of the game, specially in early game. However, as a newbie I personally wouldn't mind the possibility to challenge or be challenged by other players to a duel (Always voluntarily via request of course.)\n\nThe lore has been respected as a whole, more or less. And there are new additions and easter eggs. Sometimes I forget that this is the 2nd era whatsoever. Some of the alliances doesn't make a lot of sense. But is the only way to have 3 solid blocks towards the center of Tamriel. Rather suspicious we can't go to Elsweyr or Alinor (That sure gives a hint to Elder Scrolls VI)\n\nI don't have a very good PC and my Internet connection is not that good either, in fact, I play this on a I3 intel processor laptop and it goes fairly good. They did a good job with that\n\nThe crafting system on the other hand is absorbing and very demanding, but also very rewarding both on a personal and ingame scale. It requires a lot of commitment and investment (Skill points you could use to develop your combat skills). Perhaps you'd rather make another character to deal with your crafting issues. Since you can share ALL your objects among them. Also, there ir a e-mail ingame system to send objects to your friends without the needing of make your characters meet and trade.\n\nThe soundtrack was created by Jeremy Soule as well, is good and alll. But I guess it lacks that special something to me, it doesn't sound very "TES", it sounds more like a generic MMO, but whatever.\n\nAnd that's all for now, I'm just a level 12 templar in the Daggerfall covenant, but I'm sure as hell that I want to commit to this game. I totally recommend it.\n\n\n","January 3","true","136.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

The core product has beautiful artwork and quests that are engaging.  In fact the storylines are so expertly constructed that it feels as though I'm a character in an online epic.  They've moved me, made me laugh, and made me go "awww" at times.  The quests force you to make decisions that will have consequences later in the game, such as which friends and enemies you will make that might help or block you later on (individual NPCs, not entire factions).  I like the way crafting progression is based around destruction rather than construction.  They've thrown out the rulebook on how different classes must structure their gear and skills and this is really refreshing - it leaves a sense of a limitless and rich structure for defining the characters you want to play.\n\nThere are a couple of issues that I've noticed on the periphery of the game.  First is that prices advertised in the in-game Crown Store are not always applied as advertised, resulting in my paying around 30% more than expected in two occasions.  The customer service experience in trying to have this rectified via Steam was not helpful at all.  A friend who had the same problem was sorted with a refund but I was not - so it is "hit and miss" with the service level you can expect.  Second is the erotic Role Players who insist on putting their liaisons out there in public channels, the content of which can be brutal and distasteful.  Fortunately those occasions are rare but I would not want my kids hanging out in that kind of environment.  There are some basic things that the developers could do to make the environment safer in this respect e.g. insisting they use a private channel and/or banning reported players for not using one.","January 5","true","099.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Videos looked promising on actually putting Elder Scrolls into a multiplayer format outside of the normal MMO conventions, but in the end this game can still be summed up as: You talk to NPCs, get quests, run outside of town and kill/help/collect something/someone, and repeat.  The story lines are good, along with every conversation being voiced, but it's still a hotbar button pusher, juggling cooldowns, and weapon types hardly seem to matter.  Like if you're playing one hand weapon and shield, it doesn't really make a difference if you swing a mace, sword, or dagger, only DPS and effects are relevant.  Same w/ two handed, it could be a hammer or an axe, all that's really going to change is the sound effect when you hit something since the skill tree has been massively wiped from a normal Elder Scrolls skill tree.\n** On the other hand, If MMO's with these repetitious fetch quests don't give you Groundhog Day syndrome before you hit lvl 30, you'll enjoy this.\n","July 27, 2014","false","34.3"," 61 of 114 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","61","114","0","1"

Poor Steam integration, which is why it shows my having played only 0.1 hours; I have probably put 100+ hours in to the game. A few things to be aware of before purchasing, however:\n\n- After you buy the game, only then do they present you with the ToS and CoC. These are worded to give ZOS carte blanche to ban you from the game for practically any reason. While I have no negative personal experience with ZOS' staff, I was pretty annoyed when I'd just spent $60 on a game, only to find out that it could be taken away from me simply because ZOS find something "offensive" or "hateful" - that's the exact language they use in the Code of Conduct. It's really that vague and subjective.\n\n- Steam will want to download around 50GB of data. The ESO Launcher will then download about another 50GB of data, as no one at ZOS has ever heard of cumulative or diff/delta patching and it will literally download and install, one by one, every patch since launch over a year ago. If you have tight ISP data caps, make sure you can afford close to 100GB or prepare to spend X number of months downloading it little-by-little.\n\n- Once again, continental USA and continental Europe are the only places on Earth that apparently exist. The rest of us can look forward to having a poor ping connecting to their only two servers. However, this game has the most buttery-smooth netcode I've ever seen; it handles lag spikes very well. Occasionally you'll get melee hit from impossible distances but that's about it. I have no idea how meaningfully ping impacts end-game PvP, as I haven't tried it.\n\n\nWith that out of the way, I'd say the game is worth getting.\n\n- Detailed world. Well written and voice acted stories/quests, although Jim Cummings and Steve Blum's voices get very tired and grating. Far more variety of content than Skyrim (the whole game feels like more a sequel to Oblivion). The game has a big focus on exploring instead of just questing; it is a lot of fun just to run around the world and see what you can discover, kill, steal; it is a proper TES game.\n\n- The new game engine and combat system are both worlds better than anything the franchise has ever seen before. The game has a fair bit of variety in terms of combat styles (although stamina-nightblade is the only style I've particularly enjoyed thus far), a combination of direct, TES-esque action and gimmicky abilities more akin to most MMOs (but these are tied to the familiar TES trinity of magicka/health/stamina, rather than having set cooldowns like most MMOs). Animations are sometimes a bit stiff, taunt abilities are often ignored by mobs, the double-tap dodge-rolling system occasionally doesn't register during fights and accidentially goes off at the wrong time, breaking stealth or depleting stamina at the wrong moment in a fight. The UI could also do to be more informative but there's whole sites dedicated to legal UI mods. The game smartly limits you to 5 active abilities at once, helping to lessen the MMO cliche of standing on the spot, spamming your number keys and calling it combat.\n\n- ESO is also the least bored/frustrated I have ever been with a crafting system; I usually avoid these like the plague but ESO manages to make it pretty easy and fuss-free. I'm actually kind of enjoying it, which is a shock to me.\n\n- Grouping is a bit rough. Sometimes, when you want to group together, getting the game to properly share your quests or teleport you to the same place is a nightmare. Likewise, the game tries to be a smartarse and occasionally shares quest objectives between you and any nearby random schmuck who happens to be on the same quest as you. If you want to listen to dialogue or read books and the other person is just power-levelling through content on their fifth toon, you sometimes miss out on loot, sections of quests, and entire boss battles because they got ahead of you. Likewise, if someone cleared an area just before you arrived, you often get bad guys respawning on top of you.\n\n- Classes are a bit weird. They've very clearly tried to eschew the MMO holy trinity of DPS/tank/healer but ESO's four classes with three unique skill lines each almost seem as if they were the product of a random number generator. Trying to figure out which abilities are useful and which match together is quite difficult, especially when you have to use an ability for several hours before being able to 'morph' it in to one of two other abilities.\n\n- Mounts are fantastic, especially once you unlock the alliance war speed buff at lvl10. It is just a hell of a lot of fun to go bush bashing on a stupid-fast horse/leopard/soon bears too. The controls are really tight and weaving between mobs, sprinting forever, jumping from point to point and trying not to fall to your death or get knocked off your horse is very satisfying.\n\nUnless ZOS somehow royally ♥♥♥♥ the bed with gameplay changes, f2p ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, or ban me because someone decides I'm not very nice, I anticipate that I'll be playing this game for years.","August 29, 2015","true","0.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","3"

Many areas to explore, multiple dungeons to clear, and several playthroughs to be done. Questlines are different depending on which faction you side with, and all have a good amount of things to do.\n\nCharacters feel like they have a lot of personality, and you will definitely find people you love and hate.

The only true way to  truly experience this endless journy and heartracing adventure is think positive on how your going to play. It all involves in how YOU want to play, be who you want to be whether an archer of one of the fighting armies, Swordsman of an outlawed clan, a Sorcerer/Necromancer become a deadric prince/princess with destructive power by your choice. Vampires and werewolfs are back to transform you, you can even form your own guild/party/squad/companions! Or as you choose to play solo against the whole world.\n\nI hope this review helped any of you thinking on purchasing!\n\nJust to share what I am doing\n\n1st character :\nKyle Skylark "Male"\nNord\nSwordsman/Bowman\nA Nightblade Nightingale\nSpecialty in blacksmithing\nNot-married\nDungeon Dweller\n\n2nd Character :\nAsuna Kirigya "Female"\nImperial\nSwordman Special in Akiviri\nTemplar\nNot-married\nFrontline Soldier\n({Goal to find the dragon in skyrim})\n","June 22, 2015","true","80.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evangorman28/recommended/306130/","evangorman28","HarryBalzac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evangorman28/","116 products in account","Extremely fun game. Have not encountered any standard "fetch quest" so far. Every single interaction and mission is unique and interesting. The world is big and it looks pretty great. The production itself is very good (not brilliant, but still very good) It looks better than Skyrim. Great voice acting and writing and although it is not exactly a "normal" Elder Scrolls game, it doesnt feel like a regular MMO at all. People dont have their nametags hanging over their heads, you have to focus on them to see if they are even real players, which is a nice touch, it is more immersive this way IMO. So if you are looking for an MMO that is different (in a good way IMO) check this out. I appreciate artists not going down the "tried and trusted" methods nearly all  ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes seem to follow these days and take risks with new ideas.\n\nNote that this is not as "in depth" as Skyrim but it makes up for that with its online elements. I think a lot of the hate is from the previous release (that I never played to be fair), because seriously, this game is really great.  It still has crafting and enchanting and all that, its just a bit of a different game. As long as you are not expecting a focused single player RPG, I dont think you will be disappointed. But don't expect a standard MMO either! They really have done something different (and good) here.  Seeing as this no longer has a monthly subscription, that easily makes it one of the best non-subscription MMOs out there, certainly the best one I have played so far.\n\nCould have been a bit prettier, and dear god is the download massive. Im not taking points off for that but jeez. It took me a whole day to download. I guess we can't really do anything about games getting larger in size. So it is written. Online can be a bit buggy as well with players blinking in and out of existence instead of moving in a smooth motion. But they are minor gripes really.\n\nFor an MMO, 8.5/10. Definitely worth the money.","June 26, 2015","true","56.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It is not single player, it is an mmo. With that in mind I still found myself coming home to Tamriel. Though I haven't played through all the regions yet, the fact that I CAN go to all these places is exciting.\nYou'll find yourself getting wrapped up in the story, even if it's only yet another random person you stumble across on the road, who needs your help.\n\nThe only annoying part to this game was the fact that mounts are so expensive. You could save your coin from the very beginning, work your way through the entire start region, all the quest, and probably still not have enough gold to buy a mount. So this was my solution. I bought the normal version of the game. Then I bought 20 bucks worth of crowns for the store in game. With them I bought the upgrade to play the imperial race (You still get everything you'd get if you cought the game with the imperial race). And I had enough crowns left to get something else from the store.

As long as you come into this game with the expectation that it's an Elder Scrolls-flavored MMO, and not multiplayer Skyrim, it's very enjoyable.  You don't have the total freedom of movement that other Scrolls games allow you - enemies don't scale, so you have to stay in areas where you can handle them.  The world still feels fairly open, though, and exploration is rewarded with skill points, quests, chests, and enemies that can't be found on the main roads.  The quests are similar in style to Skyrim and Oblivion quests, with plenty of personal drama, unique objectives, and just enough lore for seasoning.  Graphically, it's good for an MMO, but it still is what it is.\n\nOne other thing that I don't think gets enough attention - this is an LGBT-freindly game that features homosexual couples as main characters in several questlines!

This game allows you to interact with the daedric princes like never before.\n\nThe pvp aspect of it is very fulfilling, it feels like I'm actually acomplishing something by raiding then capturing keeps, elder scrolls and resources, all with the help of giant trebuchet's, catapults and ballistae. Oh and flaming oil, who could forget dumping a pot of flaming oil onto a room full of unsuspecting enemies? It's great and if you've been on the edge of whether or not to buy it the best time is probably right now with the sale going on and the new update that is coming next month.","July 24, 2015","true","200.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Admittedly I've only played a few mmorpgs, but this game was the most entertaining mmorpg I have ever played, allow me to elaborate.\n\nThe storyline is very well polished, and avoids traditional mmo storyline cliches, at least the dominion storyline does. It lost me at times, but is rather easy to catch up on even if you find yourself lost. Haven't finished the storyline, but so far so good.\n\nEverybody is fully voice acted, which I know is now not as rare in games published by big studios, but the voice acting in ESO is very well executed and adds to overall immersion. The dialogue texts were easy to read, and for some reason doesn't make you want to kill yourself reading it like many other MMOs I've played.\n\nThe graphics are good, not like your call of duty or far cry 4 good, but good for a MMORPG. I was very content playing eso on my 2012 macbook pro with only 4 gigs of ram and a crappy graphics card (running the game at medium). Either way, MMOs don't advertise their graphics as much as other aspects they deliver better than non MMOs such as coop play.\n\nThe player community in ESO is not bad. For coop dungeons (if you don't have friends or they cant affor the game), you can always find a bunch of players camped outside the dungeons. Most of they aren't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and are easily approachable via text or mic.\n\nSidequests are a joy to play, though tedious if you don't read the dialogue. What I found extremely annoying was how my friend was able to reach level 7 in 2 hours, which it took me like 2 days, as I went around my area and did every possible side quest and he just rode up on his imperial pony and hopped from main quest to main quest.\n\nThe skill tree system is something i've heard people ♥♥♥♥♥ about, but the skill trees are very elaborate and allow for lots of merging, giving you hundreds, maybe thousands of combinations to choose your best playstyle. I will complain that there are few builds that lead to success and it is likely your first character will end up a failure, but reading on builds online is boring and game breaking. My guess is that this is zenimax tricking players into replaying the game, which can be tedious, but hey, there are 3 storylines and 4 classes.\n\nCombat can be repetetive, but how you customize your class abilities can heavily affect your enjoyment in combat. There is some degree of tactics in combat, but usually you just end up going back to hit and run, hit and heal, or just hit and continue hitting cause your a dragonknight tactic.\n\nFor those who said this game isn't skyrim online, I agree, and I also think its a stupid statement because the game literally isn't called skyrim online, it's not even marketed as an adaptation to the wildly successful es5, so I don't even know why that's a concern. However, this game still does what skyrim does best, it gives players the freedom to explore, and not only that encourages players to explore with sidequests scattered, this time around tamriel. Also something I find important, it gives players choice in pretty armors so you can look fabulous.\n\nI will remark some final and dissapointments this game has given me. If playing alone in the game, It almost does feel like skyrim, or just a solid rpg. However, when you're along, you tend to forget you're not the only one in this game, and though reveiewers have mentioned this game makes you feel like a piece of the bigger puzzle, at times it does treat you as the "chosen one", or at least a lone savier of a burning village. When you see ten people standing around the person asking for help to save his village, you get kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. This is nullified when playing with friends, when you're always aware that you aren't the only one, leading to no dissapointment at all.\n\nThe price tag is pretty high, got it at full price and I don't regret any part of my purchase. However, this makes the game kind of unaccessable to potential customers, which kind of blocks out the spammers and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. So I guess this isn't really a complaint once you muster the guts to make this investment.\n\nThe game is huge, for a good reason. Took me like 3 days just to download it with my crappy router. You thought you were done just downloading it from steam, here's a 40 gigabyte patch for you to enjoy in game.\n\nOverall very enjoyable game, a few nitpicks here and there. I'm not qualified enough to comment on coop an pvp or the full storyline, for that I apologize, I will be updating this review once I get some more hours into it and more importantly in the mood to do a review. Buy this game, you won't reget it. (If you do I'm not responsible.)","August 7, 2015","true","95.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hollysane/recommended/306130/","hollysane","HollySane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hollysane/","186 products in account","This game has many faces and it is what you make of it which mirrors the expression what it wants to be. It can be a buy2play MMO (if you'd want to spend some dough on it), it can be a great fantasy MMO with RPG elements set in the world of the elder scrolls along with their lore (look, we all did wish Skyrim went multiplayer).\n\nTBH, i only got hooked on the world of TES recently (again), which is Skyrim and I really loved Skyrim-the mechanics of Skyrim itself (along eith the original play, DLC and let's not forget about those community mods in total) was never suited to be a multiplayer (maybe it could but only support up to 2 people max-which would be a total bummer).\n\nSo, in response to the crave for a multiplayer, it did dawn on the developers that they would try to at least please the crowd. Yes, there are cases where MMO have made some good turnaround (take Marvel Heroes for example-now they seem to have a decent enough community going, and rathe rhave learned their lesson from their past actions) and i do hope very much that The Elder Scrolls: Tamriel Unlimited would take such an example in their (further?) development plan.\n\nMy judgement lays in the playstyle itself. Yes, trying to fit as much of Skyrim & Oblivion playstyle inside sounds good but that's not how you'd want your MMO to be if it does effect the performance of the gameplay. The clunkiness of the GUI, the first person not being too aware of the environment (because of limited visuals) and many others could be taken badly but it really does depend on the player.\n\nI myself had started with a MMO RPG I'd still very hold dear which is called The Secret World and it left an impression on any other MMOs I've tried to play with. So, yes, I may be not fit to judge this game. But, so far, the servers may need some boosting (lags are the worst) and there should be more focus on the player's interaction (whether  it be with the enemies or other players).\n\nTo the Developers: Take a page or two from Funcom, make the playstyle more dynamic (capture your audience)- make the players want to interact and not feel annoyed with other players barging in to make the kill. Create a better reason for the players to want to PvP (giving them enough to even rather sit throug rather than give up with it totally). And don't let this become another cash-grab, future contents are alright but the community always comes forst (because they are the support group of the developers).\n\nAnd to the players, I do encourage a shot at this. It may be stiff at times (it's not Skyrim), but other times it does compensiate. Don't get too judgemental about this one as they're still trying, but if you don't like this particular game- go play other then- there are many other MMOs out there that may or may not suit your playstyle. And remember, people really did work hard/at least had a smidge of effort in the production of this game.\n\nStay safe, folks :)\nHolly OUT.\n","March 20, 2015","true","3.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

(sometimes)\n* Despite the low quality textures in some areas of maps, there are beautiful and very fleshed out environments that shock even me when getting away from the starter areas.\n* When beginning the game, some starts are confusing enough to make you believe your story starts at level 7, but you are free to figure out you should have gone to the docks. (leads to a level 4 area) it's all free decisions, theres lots to do.\n*the amount of things to do and the voiced quests is much larger than star wars the old republic, there is a lack of 3 choices, but it makes up for this by voicing every quest and side quest. :)\n\n* the list goes on as pro's always do, but mostly it's surprising where the content is and how it's used, it's bethesda the only company to have demanded an open world society, even with the constraints given to them by dorky filthy rich close minded managers. stuff you CEO's :)\n\nHAVE FUN ^^","March 21, 2015","true","163.5"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Just as I was about to give up I sprinted in to the store, sold some junk and when a guard approached me I was finally able to pay my bounty. Since then I have done quite a bit of questing and this turned in to a game that I am actually enjoying quite a bit. A lot of people don't like it because it isn't what they were expecting it to be wich is Skyrim multiplayer. To be honest, I don't see much of a difference from Skyrim other then the abilities of course wich is what makes it an mmo. All in all, I think this is a great game.\n10/10 Would not kill a pet again.","March 20, 2015","true","25.1"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","9","14","5","0"

Lack of basic MMO features like a functional auction house and a competent group finder are the deal breakers for me. The game experience quickly devolves into a badly designed inventory management simulator.\n\nI should write a more complete and in depth review, but life is short and I'm not going to waste the precious moments. I ONLY recommend this game if you can get it on sale. It is not a game that has much long term appeal. As a casual short term experience you can probably get enough short term value out of this at sale price, but the full sixty-dollar buy-in is not a good value.","January 1","false","2.5"," 24 of 43 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","24","43","4","0"

I've recently bought the game on Steam to add it to my Steam collection.\n\nThe game isn't without it's flaws, from launch it was beset with issues such as bugged quests, gold selling spam - all the usual fare for an mmo. Add to that the fact that the product (rightly or wrongly) didn't meet the inflated expectation of rabid Elder Scrolls fans, missing key aspects like crime, justice, open exploration and even sitting in chairs, and a lot of people were disappointed.\n\nHowever, this is not Skyrim 2. It's an mmo.\n\nI've been playing mmos for many years now, I've experience in subscription, B2P and F2P models. I've played sandbox, theme park, action mmo and a few other more obscure ones too. In my opinion, this ranks as one of the best mmos on the market today, period.\n\nWhy? It's gorgeous for a start. The quests and story are engaging (more so if you turn off the NPC chat text using an addon I have installed - really helps you focus). Crafting is intricate and actually means something - some of the best gear in game is crafted, it goes toe-to-toe with world drops. Trading is a lot of fun, the absence of a global auction house, favouring instead a segmented guild store system means you have to think about the best markets open to you, it's a mini-game all of its own. The combat is okay, I like the action style and the minimal hotbar. They're also bringing in combat updates with the next patch to improve combat animations and a lot of the skills.\n\nThe most important thing for me however, is how accessible the dev team are. I recently spent time playing Archeage, one of the most poorly managed western releases I've ever had the displeasure of playing. Devs were unreachable, community managers were silent or hateful - it was a complete mess. Here though, ZOS do everything they can to manage expectations, respond to concerns and are refreshingly open about the future of the game. Add to this that they've responded excellently to fan suggestions and it's a great mmo to play in.\n\nA lot of the updates over the past eight months have brought the game a long way - added guild kiosks to make items publicly available for purchase, a dye system, dungeon scaling, and the upcoming crime/justice system are just a few of the additions which make this mmo far superior to any of it's themepark peers.\n\nYes there are still issues, but an mmo is always a work in progress. This game has come a long way since release, and the road ahead will bring further improvements and a lot of exciting new mechanics to the world of Tamriel.\n\nLooking forward to 2015 - can't wait to see what comes next!","December 29, 2014","true","747.3"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

This isn't quite so fair. ESO is a game inspired by the Elder Scrolls genre, it is not a game that should be graded on the Elder Scrolls rubric. For many people, this is where the deal-breaker is, and for yet others, the breaking point lies elsewhere.\n\nWith the notion that ESO finds inspiration from the Elder Scrolls genre, it is, perhaps, simpler to address the larger issue of recommending the game. When you start off and make a character, you will find a number of similarities to Skyrim. Namely, character creation offers a plethora of options, letting you adjust details as fine as chin width (or some such). I didn't much care for this, but there are those that cite this with positive inflection. You'll have to choose a race and a class. The race is, for the most part, inconsequential to gameplay. So, choose what you like! The class will determine three unique Skill Lines that you'll have access to as you progress through the game. For example, Templar's Skill Lines are Aedric Spear (damage), Dawn's Wrath (support), and Restoring Light (healing). You will gain Skill Points as you quest and level and harvest Skyshards. You can spend these Skill Points on your class skills or you may elect to place them in crafting, armor, or even a weapon skill line. When you level up, you'll get an attribute point that you can spend on magicka, health, or stamina. When you actually do get into combat, you'll find that it relies on the player more. If you want to interrupt a spell cast, you'll have to bash your opponent somehow. Occasionally, your enemy will charge up for a power attack. You can take a defensive stance and prepare for the blow, or you can try to avoid the strike by dodging.\n\nWith all of this, my point is that this game possesses a number of similarities to something like Skyrim, but it is, in fact, not Skyrim. First and foremost, ESO is its own entity whereby it attains its own identity. It attempts to mesh cooperative, and not-so-cooperative (PvP) play into a universe that we all know and love. As you run around in the game-world, you'll find dungeons, caves, and even new quests given by NPC's fearing the destruction of their town. You'll have the opportunity to become a werewolf or a vampire, granting your character new and fascinating skill lines. Or perhaps you'll go on a quest to cure yourself of the horrible affliction(?) You'll be able to group up with other players and approach steadily more dangerous dungeons, fight off Molag Bal's anchors, and discover the nature of your existence in the world of Tamriel through the main storyline. In short, ESO gives you the opportunity to explore a vast world with friends.\n\nThat all said, I cannot lie to you. The game is relatively new. It does have its bugs, its minor class biases, but I can say that the game's developers are devoted. Devoted to improving the gaming experience and responding to player feedback.\n\nRegardless, the game is fun. I absolutely love picking a direction to run off in, finding new dungeons and quests to play through, or even just to explore and harvest materials for crafting. Grouping up isn't hard, either. It can be fun playing with others, but, by and large, that's your choice. You will occasionally see other players in dungeons that your questing in. My experience is that you cooperatively push through the dungeon together! Completing objectives more quickly than you would alone without formally grouping up. Now, I will add that there are "instances" of more difficult dungeons where only your group is allowed to enter (and no one else). That said, these dungeons almost certainly require group play (though, I have read and seen people do it alone with moderate care).\n\nI'll end this by saying that the only reason I wrote this review was because of a server maitenance preventing me from playing the game. Go figure, but no. This game has something that I haven't seen in other MMO's, and that deserves a fair shot.\n\nedit #1: grammar and clarification\nedit #2: some addition\n\nWhat do I mean when I say "something I haven't seen in other MMO's?" In all honesty, I mean the interaction between the combat system, the explorative nature of the open-world, and the emphasis on getting "side-tracked."\n\nWhat I really want in an MMORPG is to be entertained, but more than that, I want to be enthralled and invested. Many games assume a notion that, as a player, I'm meant to "stand in line" as I "wait for my turn on the ride" in the "theme park." For me, there is nothing more boring. Sure, it's entertaining for a time (if you're inclined and you've got some friends to play with), but by no means does this define a lasting relationship. I can honestly say that ESO has built a system that encourages me to level crafting skills. It encourages me to find a strategy of play that works for me, as an individual in a great, open world environment. In fact, it demands that I do!\n\nIf you went to Google and you typed "best spec: {class-name-here}," you'd get a largely opinionated answer. There's just so much freedom in your playstyle and your character choices that posing the question "what's the best skill line" is actually nonsensical. A better question would be "how do I want to play?" And that's not a question Google can answer for you. The only way to answer such a question is to go try out a variety of class-race combinations and find the answer yourself!\n\nAnother thing I really enjoyed about this game is the story. It's everywhere. That is no exaggeration. I go off the "beaten path" and I find a quest that has its own story behind it. I find myself driven to discover that story and solve the problem therein. Sometimes that story ends in tragedy, and other times, I discover that where I've been questing was once a prospering village on the edge of its own destruction.\n\nThere is literally too much in this game to accurately describe what it means to play it. ESO is a game inspired by the very-core-principle of Elder Scrolls: to explore. To define your character and what that means.","October 13, 2014","true","123.2"," 119 of 228 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","119","228","0","0"

In ESO's case it's more good than bad.\nPros:\n+ Being able to colour armour and clothing is by far one of my favorite new features\n+ Being able to spawn your mount out of nowhere is a great change of pace\n+ Love all the mini bosses, there is just the right amount of them\n+ If you're struggling with a tough boss in most quests, you can literally just wait a minute or so for another player to come along and help you finally defeat that pesky powerhouse of a boss\n+ The membership is worth it in the long run if you're a highly frequent player. Being able to buy creatures, mounts, and boosts for your character with the allotted crowns is great. The 10% boost in everything is quickly apparent as you do your business throughout the world.\n+ Never gets boring\n\nCons:\n- Quests can get repetitive, although they all do have their unique attributes\n- Friends can do the same quest as you but you can't actually do it together. For example: You're doing the same quest and each person has to complete the same objectives seperately alongside each other.\n- Leveling up crafting skills and leveling up the many passive skills of each crafting skill also gets repetitive and it's mostly worth it in the long run because you can make some pretty awesome armour","July 7, 2015","true","3.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It took me quite a few hours to get into this. It's quite deep and the classes are very very deep and diverse. Plus there is just so much to see and do!! One of my favorite things so far is  searching for treasure chests which gave me great low level armor in the lower zones and are located everywhere if you look closely. The anticipation of not knowing what will be in each chest is like a fun game just by itself. The quest system is very deep. I would not recommend not listening to the quest givers because the stories behind these quests are incredible. They're not your typical kill this or fetch that quests all the time either! I followed a dog who led me to a dead body which in turn led me to a werewolf quest. The werewolf was terrorizing the town. The neat thing about it is that even NPC's that weren't involved in the quest would sometimes give me clues. (Spoiler alert) One woman who just happened to be walking by said something to me about avoiding certain alleys because of the "Alley murderer". I found the werewolf in an alley, but he proved much too tough for me at level 4 so a few people who were running around town helped me kill him.\nMany of the quests are involved and lead to different branches. I would visit dungeons and caves and sometimes have to do different things like open portals or go stand next to a certain NPC who would protect me during a bosses special move. It gave each fight an original sense of doing something different. Mobs reacted differently with special moves and I had to learn to adapt. Speaking of which...I am terrible at MMO's when it comes to using the WASD keys to move around while fighting. But in this game, I can actually do it for the first time EVER and quite efficiciently. I can actually kite a tough mob now. I still die occasionally in close quarters but the game allows me to get better through practice...love that aspect! I never could play archer well because i could never strafe good at all. For some reason this game's movement seems easier to me and I can circle the mob while using a bow or staff. And fighting is definitely awesome in this game. You need to  position yourself out of the mob's special attacks at times and circling the mob works well at times too. The best thing is that when I hit the mob, it actually feels like i'm hitting the mob. Even as a Sorcerer, there is a satisfying OOMPH to my special spells when the mob goes down.\nThe hardest thing about this game is deciding what class to be. There are so  many options in each class. You can be anything you want really....a heavy armor fire sorcerer even! the only thing I don't like is when you spend your skill points, it's super expensive to change your mind...100 gold per point and you can get over 300 points worth of skills. Fortunately, 300 points will allow you to be proficient in several classes, so it's not a game breaker, but it's still a pain if you don't like the way your toon is shaping up. You only get 6 skills on your toolbar, but you get two toolbars after a certain level, but it still means you have to choose wisely as far as what to specialize in.\nI only delved into crafting a little bit so far because I spend too much time exploring which is a blast. The crafting seems very cool and I was able to craft items I actually needed which was great. Finding the items i needed for crafting wasn't hard since there are chests, bags, urns, etc. EVERYWHERE...and I mean everywhere. They are filled with all manner of items for crafting. I made some cloth pants that were much better than anything that had dropped during my travels. I had found several great pants but nothing in cloth. Ironically I found out late that you should mix your armor up at low levels so it all levels up and now I'm doing that.\nI'm three days into the game and still not level 10!!!! Lol! There are just too many things to do and see and I keep getting sidetracked. Typically, i'll be hunting for treasure chests and see some lone person on a beach or in the forest and talk to them. They'll need help (a quest) and I'll do it thinking it will only take a few minutes and it opens up a whole new storyline...and the each story is just too interesting to quit! On top of that, many of these side quests hve little tidbits of information for your main quests or even lore that leads you to other things!! I never get anything done, but it's very cool!\nIf you like reading and lore by the way, this is the game for you. There are books, letters, notes, everywhere and the stories in some of them are fascinating. Many of them lead to quests and many have information that will pertain to people you meet making the world and especially the NPC's seem alive! Some of the books give you skillups as well...pure awesomeness!\nIf you're the type of person who wants to rush to end game, this is not the game for you. Not only would it defeat the concept of how to play this game, but you would miss out on so much. And since the gamne is free, you don't need to rush...just explore and enjoy the stories and lore...it's really worth taking your time.\nAs for the classes....I've liked them all so far at the lower levels. Some of the skills I picked were disappointing and some were awesome. I would reccomend researching a skill to see if it fits your play style before investing your point.\nBag space and bank soace like every other FTP game sucks. I can never have enough bag space and with so many containers just lying around in this world, you can fill your pack VERY quickly if you pick uop everything. There are waypoints that are free to use so you can sell stuff, but a lot of the items are worthless unless you craft...then they're great! It would probably be quite challenging to level every craft just because of the bag space. You would have to do them one or two at a time, I guess.\nAt first I felt like this game was just too daunting. The whole class thing confused me.I kept dying too easily if I accidentally pulled too many mobs. But now that i'm three days into and still only level 7...I'm starting to love it. I think I was just too used to MMO's where you  level up quickly, ignore what the questgivers say except to find out what they want you to kill, and mad rush my way to the endgame. It's not going to be like this in this game....it's not like those other MMO's. It's similar but with hints of Skyrim and a whole lot of interesting story mixed in and strange places to visit and cool NPC's to meet.\nThere are quite a few people in my server, but most are just soloing until they have trouble with a quest and then there is an occasional shout for help on certain quests. As for guilds, I've seen a few shouts but nothing like the endless shouts in other MMO's I've played...not sure if this is because I'm in a low level area or not.\nNo matter what, I'm having a blast in this game and look forward to seeing what higher level play is like! I'll update this review when I get to a higher level!\n","June 28, 2015","true","351.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","4"

Each of the 3 alliances get their own pve story and area to explore containing at least 5 sections of the map each but unfortunatley it's not a multi-faction free-roam and the alliance you choose determines your play through (you can have 8 characters so could have 1 for each if you choose).\n\nUPDATE: 30/12/15\nThe price is now well worth the purchase, the updates have made it run smoother and there are less issues, also they have finaly added pad support (although using it does change the UI) which is brilliant regardless of the small changes.\nThis game is now a good 98% recommend","April 13, 2015","true","252.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I have played WoW, archeage and a few others, whilst they all had good points\nand bad points this game has EVERYTHING.\n\nPros:\n\nInteresting NPCs, all fully voiced with FEELING. The voice actors don't feel bored\n*cough* Peter the boring ghost out of destiny *cough*\n\nSkill system makes leveling up more than just a *ding*- I have spent more time than I like to admit\njust thinking over what\nto put my next point into. *NOTE: be careful, once you put a point in, it costs a lot of gold to get it out apparently\n\nThe worlds HUGE!\nWell duh Lewis its an elder scrolls game what did you think it would be? No voice in my head,\nI mean more than that- skyrim, morrowind, daggerfall, they felt empty, this game has quests,\nthings to find, items to pick up, runes to collect (more on that later) and much, much more at every\nturn\n\nThis ones more hards to explain. You know that feeling when in Skyrim you heard the theme and you felt epic?\nWhen I'm riding down the road on my horse listening to the music, (for more on my horse see cons) that feeling\noccurs, RIDING BETWEEN TOWNS FEELS EPIC a.k.a exactly what a game like this should do\n\nMusic is awesome and meaningful without breaking emersion\n\n*Sigh* Its time for...\n\nCons:\n\n£70 for the "real" version??? I bought imperial addition because of two things: "Horses are apparently super expensive" and well since theres only one dlc for the game I may as well. It is worth it, especially if you plan on playing with friends due to the "scrolls of mara" which gives you a 10% exp bonus and has a hilarious animation that left me and my friend in stitches (SPOILER ALERT: sparkles come out your bum as you essentially marry them). Anyways back to my original point...\nThere is nearly £30s MORE dlc in this game AFTER the imperial addition. I'll be honest I don't really mind that. I wouldn't mind if there was £50 more dlc that adds content into the game but instead the crown store (which is generally not to pay to win) allows you to buy the "adventure's pack". This pack allows you to be ANY RACE in ANY alliance. Forcing my friends to be either a Redguard, Orc or Brenton was horrible, my friend bought the game so he could play with me, his words: "I can't wair to be a kajit like I was in skyrim", being the understanding fellow he is he picked Orc without a fuss-\nRACE BOUND PAY WALLS SUCK!\nAlso optional subscription which gives you DLC for free, cosmetic items and 10% bonus to everything, theres literally a list of which includes EXP, research times, wiping your ♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥ing your mum, etc, etc. Ok, I'll be honest this games way of keeping the game supported is actually the best system out there with possible the exception of Wow except this game has no sub! :D Not pay to win at all, mostly cosmetic with a few "get there faster" style thing (e.g. pay £5 to do this, this or this or spend a few hours doing quests).\n\nTo sum up my first con, Money system GOOD not crap like certain other games that come to mind *cough* archeage *cough*\n\nGraphics are ok on ultra if you can run it, one of the best for an MMO. Graphics good enough for things to look cool, not good enough for me to cry whilst looking directly at it.\n\nNow this one bugs me the most: random frame drops after playing for a while.\nPRO TIP: Use the 64 bit version of the game, in files it's called ESO64.exe more or less solved the problem however only use this method if your PC has more than  4GBs of RAM. I'm not gonna start explaining 32 bit vs 64 bit so google it :P\n\n\nIn Conclusion Or TL;DR:\nBUY THE GAME AND YOU WILL BECOME ADDICTED FASTER THAN YOU CAN FUS RO DAH... but only get it in the sales when its 50% off like it did ;)\n\nTime to go play more ESO...\n</Rant>","March 15","true","140.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

It was kinda weird fighting through the spooky, "deserted" ruins with crowds of people doing the same quest. Then when one of the NPCs said, "Here comes another one" I realized I just had to go with the flow. And it was so good to be back in Elder Scrolls territory. Although I'd prefer more solitude, the game is geared to groups and I've had to learn to take advantage of other questers to help me defeat difficult foes - I was getting sick of dying. The crafting system is somewhat complex, but I've decided to leave that until later. At the moment my mission is to see just how far a lone character can go in this game.","February 16","true","209.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I haven't played too many mmorpgs before this game, and that was because of one thing. The class system. Most mmos have a class system that restricts your skills, weapons, and armor, and I find it to be ridiculous because you can't choose how you play. In Elder Scrolls Online, there is a class system, yes, but unlike all other mmos I've seen, you have full control over your path. There are specific skills only a certain class may have, which makes sense, but there are plenty of other skills you get, regardless of your class. You decide the armor style you use, light, medium, or heavy, and you choose your own weapons. You can even craft your own! Also, the combat system works smoothly, there are plenty of quests to complete (I haven't scratched the surface), and a huge map to explore! I say don't even hesitate in buying this game.","February 16","true","120.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

My VR2 assassin.\nI felt the pain in my heart. I felt tears running down my face. Yet, I did not give up.\nI created a new character. A tank. He is now VR3, and he loves horses.\n\nThis is my personal story with the game. Now it is time for pros and cons.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Not too difficult of an MMO.\n- Only 5 abilities, so no 30 ability combos you have to execute perfectly like in WoW\n- Lovely graphics, great looking world.\n- Gotta love that Elder Scrolls universe.\n- Morphing abilities to get a more personal feel with your build.\n- So far the community seems to be nice, always someone in /zone who is up for a chat.\n\nCONS:\n\n- ESO didn't have Thieves Guild for the longest time, now they finally bring it out and it's a DLC... Seriously?..\n- They literally promised us the Thieves Guild when they were in f***ing BETA and now I have to pay for the DLC?!?!\n- No "duel" option.\n- You can only play with your friends if they are in the same alliance. No way to interact with your best friend who's in the Dominion when you're from the Pact. Great way to promote racism.\n- A lot of microtransactions. And even though you don't have to purchase anything, when you see someone riding past you on a dinosaur, it triggers you and you still want to buy it.\n- Thieves Guild is a DLC...

This game implements so many more features then skyrim did. One big thing is that you can just walk away from a chest or body you searched and it exits out instead of having to press esc. Something so simple is so needed on making the gameplay smooth. Finding good armour, and weapons takes a while, same with leveling up. Because of this the game makes it more challenging and time to actually do everything. Skyrim was so easy and i feel ESO fixes that. 1000 Hours in i will probabaly not finished everything and in skyrim it would have been done before 500 hours. Im loving this game so far, and having to pay for DLC or Live isnt some cheap microtransaction either. Its worth it in the end and i will probabaly buy it at some point.

That´s what games should be like\n\none thing tho, its too easy in my opinion. As a lvl 15 character i can do lvl 21 quests easy as damn, even legendary enemies are fairly easy to kill in most situations, and if you play with a group you basically own the bloddy place.\n\nThere should be more zones to be honest. i expected more areas to explore. I want Elsweyr. And West Skyrim. pls gif me\n\nAnd finally......FOR THE FINAL COUNTDOWN!!!! Cyrodiil.....is.....HUGE!! it took me ages to walk across the bloody zone and fast traveling inside cyrodiil is rip. you basically have to die if you´re gonna get somewhere which sucks....or you can walk the mile...ur choice o.o\n\nThe nature in cyrodiil is really lame as well, the landscape is pretty flat with a few trees and alot of grass and a few stones, thats basically it. so dont expect much, its not like TES Oblivion, Oblivion was better Cx\n\nAlliance War in cyrodiil is like Planetside 2 without guns and vehicles, just sayn. no h8. #WalkingSimulator\n\nbut the game is good overall. its not worth 55 € or whatever, i bought it when it was on sale last week.

Wow, I'm really impressed ! :)  I have more fun than I thought I would have.  I played WoW for years and got tired of it...  Now with this MMO it's really a new genre of MMO and so fun !  I enjoy the first person side and being able to explore this huge world and so beautiful...  This really doesn't feel like the other mmos.. I think people got tired of other types of MMOs.  ESO is unique, the fights are so fun, even more than Skyrim I would say.  I'm a huge Elder Scrolls fan and I cal say that ESO is really worth of the series...  I highly recommend it !  There are only 2 MMOs I liked and they are WoW and ESO and I tried many others.  If you are tired of WoW, you won't be tired of ESO since it is so different and it feels like playing Skyrim, Morrowind or Oblivion.  I'm really happy of having bought this game yesterday in special and I would say that even at full price the game is really worth the price !\n\nHonestly, usually if I don't like a game I will stop playing it after only a few hours and will never touch it again...  I'm happy that it does the opposite with this game.  The quest are really well made and original.. it's not all the time "Kill 10 monsters"... It's really more realistic and into role playing.. I would say if you played one of the recent Elder Scrolls, you will find often similar quests in this game.","February 9","true","27.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Give it a chance if you like MMORPG/RPG or the Elder scrolls!\n\n-----------------\n\nI played the beta and found it to be decent at best, it was definately not worth a subscription fee. Now however, with the subscription fee gone, it is worth it. If you're into elder scrolls or RPG/MMORPG's, then you should give this a shot! Especially now with the subscription gone.\n\nThe PvE questlines are really good, everything is voice acted. The main quest is good and immersive and the sidequests have a nice amount of lore and immersion put into them.\n\nWith the recently added crime system, playing as a sneaky thief is really fun. Stealing stuff, breaking into houses to steal their riches and even leveling within the thieves is much fun to be had. I really hope its just the top of the iceberg of whats to come!\n\nThe PvP is the most fun I've had in a while. I'm a huge PvP player, and while there is room for improvements and polish, the large scale PvP is still one of the best experiences so far. Setting up siege weapons on the walls, breaking down the gate or the enemy walls and capture their precious keeps! One of the best part is that you can level up by doing PvP, get gear and gold!\n\nThe character customization is awesome. You can basically become whatever character you want. Start as a mage and wear heavy armor, fight with a two handed axe to become a Battlemage for example. Any class can use and specialize in any armor/weapon, no matter which class you chose.\n\nThe Crown store which was added due to the removal of subscription fee, has *so far* not showed signs of becoming Pay 2 Win. Its mostly costumes and mount skins and stuff like that. I personally really hope for more cosmetic effects, especially for skills/spells!\n\nThere is probably more I'm forgetting right now, and while there is still room for improvements, as always, it is a much better game than it was at release. If you're in the "should I try it?" stage, then I would definately recommend it. Its in a much better stage than it was at release.","March 24, 2015","true","109.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I love MMORPGs, the feeling of adventures, playing with others. After quitting I played open world games like Skyrim for compensation. I was stunned by the story of ESO which I never heard of before (never heard of Morrowind, Daggerfall, Oblivion). TESO - Elder Scrolls Online, was a little bit the best of the best for me. And I am not disappointed:\n- A huge, open world\n- Amazing graphics\n- Good spell animations\n- Interesting story lines\n- Good and different quest types (no collect X of Y quests)\n- An acceptable amount of players\n- No abonnement (!)\n\nYou can chose your alliance, your race, your class. But without having problems of chosing the wrong: Be flexible and wear heavy armor with a mage. Become a healer not by chosing one, become a healer by chosing mage and use healing scepters. You change your mind? No problem: Just stop using healing scepters, start using destruction scepters. Or swords. Or whatever you want.\n\nNegative points:\n- You level extremely fast (good for students without much time, not good for bored pupils wich much time)\n- The amoung of gold you get for quests etc. is way too less for some items.

My first Elder Scrolls game was Skyrim. I played it for hours and hours.\nWhen I heard about Elder Scrolls Online, I immediately wanted to buy the game, but a lot of very bad reviews made me decide not to buy the game. But even though I read about all those bad reviews, I still kept following news about ESO through Steam, Facebook, and the official ESO website.\nAs soon as I learned ESO got a mayor upgrade and became ESO - Tamriel Unlimited, I also noticed the bad reviews becomming less and more and more good reviews started to appear. A few weeks ago I could not longer hold my curiosity about the game in check and just bought it anyways. Now, I regret that I did not buy it a lot sooner, because the game is INCREDEBLY COOL :)\nEverything is great about the game, from the graphics, to the storyline, to the easyness of the UI and controlls. This game is very exciting even when playing as a single player, just following quest after quest and getting completely lost in its vast storyline. But also the Massive Multiplayer fights are super cool.\n\n--------------------\nMy Positives:\n--------------------\n++++ Storyline (singleplayer is superb, but also grouping and playing with friends in quests is excellent)\n++++ Graphics (I play at ultra high and my screen becomes a dream where I control everyting)\n++++ Crafting (you really have to craft and use the crafts to get better at it)\n+++ Character Creation (lots of ways to create diffrent races and looks)\n++ Gear painting  (not many colours to paint your armour, or maybe I just did not unlock enough colours yet)\n++++ MMO (in Cyrodil you can fight in massive multiplayer fights for your allegiance)\n++++ Guilds (easy to create your own guild and extend your guild from a few ranks to a real lot of ranks. You can even give your own names to diffrent ranks)\n\n--------------------\nMy Negatives:\n--------------------\n* There are NO negatives to find in this game :P\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nESO versus Skyrim and the previous Elder Scrolls Games\n------------------------------------------------------------\nFor those Elder Scrolls fans who stated that ESO has not the feeling Skyrim has and who said that it did not play as good as Skyrim did, you are very wrong! At least after the big upgrade and ESO became ESOTU. This game has a lot more then Skyrim had. ESOTU is a finetuned version of Skyrim where all the good things from Skyrim became better. In Skyrim I never played with a sword and never invested my skillpoints in stamina. But now in ESOTU you can use both magic and stamina based weapons and spells at the same time :) So now I have to invest in EVERYTHING :p\n\n\nSo my dear review readers, I hope my review made you convince to buy this game and become as fascinated by ESOTU as I am.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nTommy","June 16, 2015","true","589.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It seemed most were upset that it's not just like the other Elder Scrolls games, and it does suck it's not exactly the same.\nBut I still find The Elder Scrolls Online to be highly enjoyable. If I weren't playing it exclusively with my girlfriend whom games less than me, I would be obsessively playing it.\nThe quests are like the usual but with a twist that makes them more unique. They have characters that I actually want to help. Maybe it's the fact they're fully voiced, but the characters feel more real to me and I like that some quests have the choices to have a character live or die. And if you get sick of quests there's other places to explore.\nCrafting is actually fun. I love cooking.\nThe world itself also feels more immersive because you can interact with it, Being able to enter most buildings, search through dressers and crates.. In most MMO's you can barely interact with the environment.\n\nThere's so much more to be said, but it will take too long. If you're expecting something like Skyrim, then don't buy it because you'll most likely be disappointed. If you look at this as an MMO with Elder Scrolls mixed in, and you watch gameplay videos and it looks enjoyable to you, then you should get it. It's a very, very gorgeous game that's more immersive than most MMOs.","October 30, 2015","true","90.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The supscription fee is gone. Just pay once and you're done. With that out of the way let me judge this game as an mmo and its similarities to elder scrolls games. Every mmo uses hot keys for abilities and they are all effective to change the way of battle. There also is no respawn times on bosses or chests with mission items. Other players now feel like they are aiding you instead of steaqling your objectives. This game borrows a lot of features from Oblivion ranging from the lockpick system and guilds. The fighters guild is back. The level up system is equilvalent to fallout but the skill point system for weapons and armor are still there from skyrim. Overall this is one of the only mmo's that feels like a single player rpg with an adapting enviorment.

My advice to new players would be to get a mount ASAP, as the open world is massive.. but the quick travel system is fairly good once you discover locations.\n\nProbably the best aspect of the game, is that any class can play pretty much any role (DPS, tank, healer etc), its up to you what your character can do, and what you put skill points into (of which there are plenty once you get going)\n\nRegular Patches are good, and new crown content, updates and everything are great and regular. I play on low graphics on a low end PC and it runs fine, low graphics arent anything to complain about either. If you enjoy Elder scrolls story, Battles, PVP castle sieges, dungeon raiding for high end loot or an escape from the thought of your parents imminent divorce, you will enjoy The Elder Scrolls Online.","July 6, 2015","true","604.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

I suppose the wildcard involved here is ZeniMax Online Studios, whom I'd never thought would've made an effort. What you have here is something that has much more in common with The Secret World, Dungeons & Dragons: Online, and Uru: Ages Beyond Myst than it does with WoW, Guild Wars 2, or Wildstar. I'll let that stand on its own.\n\nCouple this with...\n\nThe genuine respect shown for people of all genders and body types in the character creation (I can make a fat lady with small breasts);\n\nThe overall endless depths and diversity of respectfully depicted culture and intrigue present (mostly thanks to Elder Scrolls lore);\n\nThe fact that progression is tied to story-arcs rather than compulsive number-building, and one will want to continue playing out of engagement with the story and a desire to see what happens next rather than a mindless addiction;\n\nHow uncompromisingly fun and without grind crafting and gathering is, especially when you take into account the many chests you can lockpick;\n\nThe huge number of interactive things (like lore books and lootable containers) which help make the world feel alive and more believable;\n\nThe chatty and characterful NPCs (esp. Razum-dar) that always have something relevant and intelligent to say (versus the puerile nonsense that's usually trotted out);\n\nThe presence of choice and consequence (even if it is mostly cosmetic);\n\nThe stunning fact that they support visually disabled people by having everything (everything!) voice-acted to a level which is matched solely by TSW, and then only just;\n\nThe diversity allowed in character building, in that it's almost a freeform system (I honestly wish they'd just drop the classes and make them extra trees, then it would be freeform without err on par with TSW);\n\nThat there's penalties for being an absolute dirty-behind of a person (so if you steal and kill friendly NPCs, you'll have a bounty on your head that even other players can collect);\n\nThe wise choice of having three factions, which does much to dispel the Us vs. Them toxicity that's so pervasive in MMOs that have PvP;\n\nThat you can wander, roleplay, and have fun without feeling pressured;\n\nThe absence of raids means that people don't rush through the game, and that the journey hasn't been forsaken in favour of 'the game is fun when you get to the end of it' nonsense;\n\nThat it's so determined to distance itself from an MMO that it doesn't even have an auction house, since it doesn't want to promote grinding in any way;\n\nAnd so much more.\n\nIt's not Uru. It's not The Secret World. And I'm not sure if I'd even put it above Dungeons & Dragons: Online. But if you've played all of the prior to death, and you're looking for a fun world where you can roleplay, do your own thing, and not be punished for that? Then this is the game for you. It's almost politically correct in how much of an MMO it isn't. And I dig it for that.\n\nIt could use more puzzles, puzzle-dungeons, and intrigue/mystery-based plotlines to really keep one on the edge of one's seat, and it could also use a full body in first person view to complete the sense of immersion, but even with these caveats mentioned it's still surprisingly great. It's not quite met its potential, but it's better than most of the garbage out there. This one can say he likes being a khajiit in it.\n\nIt's not like Skyrim. It's not like an MMO. If anything, it's like Oblivion, yet with its own pros and cons versus that game. And at the end of the day, even though I wasn't expecting to like this, I actually do. I like this and I feel I can recommend it in good conscience. Not many MMOs I can say that about (barring Uru, DDO, and TSW).\n\nSo there you go.","April 1, 2015","true","701.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DemBoyo/recommended/306130/","DemBoyo","Chronovus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DemBoyo/","580 products in account","A very polished MMO that I would highly suggest picking up now that the biggest hurdle of monthly payments has been completely eliminated from the game. The gameplay vaguely feels like the Oblivion/Skyrim-esque combat you'd be used to, but when you pay more attention to it, you'll definitely notice some differences. However, don't let this statement phase you, the game itself is really well designed. The combat is still very enjoyable and feels distinctly different from a lot of other MMOs out there, the environments as well as the things that live in them feel very colorful and vibrant, a staple trait of the Elder Scrolls series, and the story is honestly pretty interesting, which isn't a statement I use often regarding the stories that most MMOs have to offer. In conclusion, definitely pick up this game if you're a big fan of the Elder Scrolls series, an MMO fanatic, or just someone looking for a new experience. I don't think you'll regret it.","February 3","true","16.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

My first Elder Scrolls game was Skyrim. I played it for hours and hours.\nWhen I heard about Elder Scrolls Online, I immediately wanted to buy the game, but a lot of very bad reviews made me decide not to buy the game. But even though I read about all those bad reviews, I still kept following news about ESO through Steam, Facebook, and the official ESO website.\nAs soon as I learned ESO got a mayor upgrade and became ESO - Tamriel Unlimited, I also noticed the bad reviews becomming less and more and more good reviews started to appear. A few weeks ago I could not longer hold my curiosity about the game in check and just bought it anyways. Now, I regret that I did not buy it a lot sooner, because the game is INCREDEBLY COOL :)\nEverything is great about the game, from the graphics, to the storyline, to the easyness of the UI and controlls. This game is very exciting even when playing as a single player, just following quest after quest and getting completely lost in its vast storyline. But also the Massive Multiplayer fights are super cool.\n\n--------------------\nMy Positives:\n--------------------\n++++ Storyline (singleplayer is superb, but also grouping and playing with friends in quests is excellent)\n++++ Graphics (I play at ultra high and my screen becomes a dream where I control everyting)\n++++ Crafting (you really have to craft and use the crafts to get better at it)\n+++ Character Creation (lots of ways to create diffrent races and looks)\n++ Gear painting  (not many colours to paint your armour, or maybe I just did not unlock enough colours yet)\n++++ MMO (in Cyrodil you can fight in massive multiplayer fights for your allegiance)\n++++ Guilds (easy to create your own guild and extend your guild from a few ranks to a real lot of ranks. You can even give your own names to diffrent ranks)\n\n--------------------\nMy Negatives:\n--------------------\n* There are NO negatives to find in this game :P\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nESO versus Skyrim and the previous Elder Scrolls Games\n------------------------------------------------------------\nFor those Elder Scrolls fans who stated that ESO has not the feeling Skyrim has and who said that it did not play as good as Skyrim did, you are very wrong! At least after the big upgrade and ESO became ESOTU. This game has a lot more then Skyrim had. ESOTU is a finetuned version of Skyrim where all the good things from Skyrim became better. In Skyrim I never played with a sword and never invested my skillpoints in stamina. But now in ESOTU you can use both magic and stamina based weapons and spells at the same time :) So now I have to invest in EVERYTHING :p\n\n\nSo my dear review readers, I hope my review made you convince to buy this game and become as fascinated by ESOTU as I am.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nTommy","June 16, 2015","true","589.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

And it runs very well; I haven't had any problems maintaining a high framerate, and I've encountered very few bugs. Secondly, the combat is really solid and fun. It's action oriented with a minimal hud.

I suppose the wildcard involved here is ZeniMax Online Studios, whom I'd never thought would've made an effort. What you have here is something that has much more in common with The Secret World, Dungeons & Dragons: Online, and Uru: Ages Beyond Myst than it does with WoW, Guild Wars 2, or Wildstar. I'll let that stand on its own.\n\nCouple this with...\n\nThe genuine respect shown for people of all genders and body types in the character creation (I can make a fat lady with small breasts);\n\nThe overall endless depths and diversity of respectfully depicted culture and intrigue present (mostly thanks to Elder Scrolls lore);\n\nThe fact that progression is tied to story-arcs rather than compulsive number-building, and one will want to continue playing out of engagement with the story and a desire to see what happens next rather than a mindless addiction;\n\nHow uncompromisingly fun and without grind crafting and gathering is, especially when you take into account the many chests you can lockpick;\n\nThe huge number of interactive things (like lore books and lootable containers) which help make the world feel alive and more believable;\n\nThe chatty and characterful NPCs (esp. Razum-dar) that always have something relevant and intelligent to say (versus the puerile nonsense that's usually trotted out);\n\nThe presence of choice and consequence (even if it is mostly cosmetic);\n\nThe stunning fact that they support visually disabled people by having everything (everything!) voice-acted to a level which is matched solely by TSW, and then only just;\n\nThe diversity allowed in character building, in that it's almost a freeform system (I honestly wish they'd just drop the classes and make them extra trees, then it would be freeform without err on par with TSW);\n\nThat there's penalties for being an absolute dirty-behind of a person (so if you steal and kill friendly NPCs, you'll have a bounty on your head that even other players can collect);\n\nThe wise choice of having three factions, which does much to dispel the Us vs. Them toxicity that's so pervasive in MMOs that have PvP;\n\nThat you can wander, roleplay, and have fun without feeling pressured;\n\nThe absence of raids means that people don't rush through the game, and that the journey hasn't been forsaken in favour of 'the game is fun when you get to the end of it' nonsense;\n\nThat it's so determined to distance itself from an MMO that it doesn't even have an auction house, since it doesn't want to promote grinding in any way;\n\nAnd so much more.\n\nIt's not Uru. It's not The Secret World. And I'm not sure if I'd even put it above Dungeons & Dragons: Online. But if you've played all of the prior to death, and you're looking for a fun world where you can roleplay, do your own thing, and not be punished for that? Then this is the game for you. It's almost politically correct in how much of an MMO it isn't. And I dig it for that.\n\nIt could use more puzzles, puzzle-dungeons, and intrigue/mystery-based plotlines to really keep one on the edge of one's seat, and it could also use a full body in first person view to complete the sense of immersion, but even with these caveats mentioned it's still surprisingly great. It's not quite met its potential, but it's better than most of the garbage out there. This one can say he likes being a khajiit in it.\n\nIt's not like Skyrim. It's not like an MMO. If anything, it's like Oblivion, yet with its own pros and cons versus that game. And at the end of the day, even though I wasn't expecting to like this, I actually do. I like this and I feel I can recommend it in good conscience. Not many MMOs I can say that about (barring Uru, DDO, and TSW).\n\nSo there you go.","April 1, 2015","true","701.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You have skills to use, auto target when using bow and spells, mixed style of attacks.\nA lot Chinese players complain about ES style combat I'd say they just get too much effected by Japanese action games. ES doesn't need exotic splash style combat, though plain slash is too much lame as well. So here ESO really make a good compromise for the combat.\n\nFree style talents point, choose your own path for upgrading.\n\nSimple user interface. Let you focus more on the enviroment instead of staring at the mini-map.\n\nAnd generally , among so many fast-paced games , ESO is really an impressing one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sciamachy/recommended/306130/","sciamachy","Skiamakhos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sciamachy/","59 products in account","First a little background: I LOVE Skyrim. I practically live there. I used to pretty much live in WoW's Azeroth but I got jaded with the whole subscription MMO thing - nothing you did made much difference to the world, & you'd likely get killed by a pack of mobs you'd just killed respawning before you'd had time to heal from the previous battle. I lot faith in MMOs - the subscription thing just made it apparent to me that the art & entertainment aspect of gaming was becoming very much a secondary or even tertiary thing, falling behind making big money out of a lot of gullible people.\n\nSo when the ESO beta happened, I was interested but jaded, and wow, did it ever have a lot of bugs. Fair enough, it was a beta test, but they went live so quickly after that they didn't have any time to address bugs, and at what £15/month? It was way too much to ask. I honestly couldn't recommend a game that cost you nearly £250 to play in its first year - and the quests were dull, and the lag such that you could be dead & not know it, killed by a dozen mobs you couldn't see because they hadn't spawned in your client yet. It was execrable - I'd not seen worse, and I'm an old guy, I've been gaming since Pong and to quote Blade Runner "I've... seen things... you people wouldn't believe" - but yeah, this game, at release, was one of the worst attempts I'd seen in ages, and worse yet they were ruining my beloved ESO franchise. Remember, I f'ing LOVED Skyrim.\n\nSo, what's changed? Firstly, it's a one-off buy to play model now. Your first year now costs 1/5 what it previously did. The drops from mobs have increased. This is a big deal folks. Back in the beta, horses cost $HUGEAMOUNTS & boss mobs dropped 1 gold if you were very lucky. At that rate, grinding for gold to get your horse could take you till you're in your retirement home complaining about the crappy brain interface the latest version's got. No - NOW we have ordinary mobs dropping up to 6 gold, and often enough a piece of armour or a weapon. You can craft useful stuff, and farm mining or woodwork or cloth-making to generate yet more cash. That horse is just a few weeks away now. Also, quests are part of an ongoing story - you evacuate an island that's being invaded, and defeat a siege back on the mainland, and it affects what mobs and NPCs are available in any given area at any time. Some mobs actually turn neutral when you've defeated the boss that was riling them up against you - so, e.g. there's a bunch of skeletons defending a dragon priest's shrine, once you defeat the necromancer who's controlling them they sort of mill about ignoring you unless you start a fight with them. This makes sense, far better than WoW in that regard. What you do affects things around you.\nAlso: crime! You can make crime pay, & frankly most of my characters do engage in it a bit at the start. You begin with some very basic gear but you can sneak about & nick bits & pieces off the market. These will get confiscated if you're arrested. If discovered in the act of committing a crime, civilians & guards will attack you unless you surrender. If you run away, it'll be ages till they forget your misdeeds & you can safely interact with them again. One of my early nightblades got caught pickpocketing: I had to kill the victim, & the guards came after me so I ended up in the wilderness for days till my bounty faded to nothing.\nIf you're wise, you'll find the outlaws' sanctuary. This is a lot like the thieves' guild in Skyrim's Riften. They'll fence stolen gear for you, you can pay off your bounty if you have one, and they'll even "launder" stolen items so that you won't lose that sweet helm or sword when you next get caught. Good way to get a 250 gold piece helmet for 15 gold!\nNow, I hope that gives you the impression I'm trying to give here - from an awful, awful beta that was released too early & too overpriced, it's become an involving and immersive game with quests that make sense & make you feel part of the action. Many of the bugs have been ironed out, and lag is rarely an issue any more. From being frankly disgusted at Zenimax's fairly pathetic offering, I'm now genuinely impressed & glad that they dropped the subscription & glad I bought this game. Well worth £50 & 80Gb of HD space.","April 4, 2015","true","196.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","3"

Hearing terrible things can do this. Yet, when I began to play I found myself immersed in an MMO quite unlike the handful I had played before. While some MMOs require grinding in many skill areas (i.e. runescape) this is not what i have experienced with The Elder Scrolls Online. While you do grind quests, I do not find myself running around killing every enemy in sight for the experience, nor do I find myself performing the same task over and over for hours on end to gain a few levels. The gameplay is quite enjoyable and different from previous Elder Scrolls games, using an ability-based skill sytem instead of the tiring combat I found in Skyrim (though I did enjoy getting creative in TES:V).\n\nAs far as the graphics go I am amazed at the awe-inspiring graphics for a game this size. Though I suspect the large download size has much to do with it, it is nonetheless a positive aspect of the game.\n\nPerformance wise the game has crashed several times due to what I assume to be connection issues (I live on a college campus so this is not unexpected), but they do not take away from the game. It runs smoothly, the framerate staying within a range of 10-15 fps away from 60 on high and ultra setting graphics (Though your experience may vary). I have not spent nearly as much time on this game as I plan to and only recently purchased it but I am highly satisifed with what I have experienced. For $60 this game offers hours of enthralling gameplay and what I hope to be a high replay value.","April 1, 2015","true","32.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

My main character has only reached lvl 28. Not sure about the PVP, but if you want to enjoy decent stories with a group of friends, this is the game. ESO has a very good story and background lores, which is consistent with the entire Elder Scroll series. I am no hardcore TES fan but I have played skyrim for 1k+ hours without modding the game mainly because I wanted to explore the story and lore contents to the fullest extent. Some hardcore TES fans are disappointed with ESO for whatever reasons. I think the story is not disappointing. Characters (races, cultures, accents etc not actual individual character) I loved from Skyrim are still here with very interesting plotlines that are subtly connected to the previous games.\nOf course, I am not sure whether I will enjoy the end game contents and large scale PVP though. I didn't enjoy those aspects in GW2 or WoW so I guess this game sort of suits my interests and its mmo-ness is only serving my desire to play co-opting with other people in progressing the story.\n\nWord of advice: If you don't like the white horse, do not buy the imperial edition. And Buy the ESO Plus at least for the first month for extra xp and some currency to buy a mount. It is pain in the ♥♥♥ to save up for mount in early game.

I've been an avid elder scrolls fan since Morrowind for Xbox, and was excited to hear about this release. Some friends play the beta and didn't recommend it. But it went on sale for Christmas last year and I had enough funds in my steam wallet so I said why not?! So glad I did! It's not really what I expected from an MMO (which was mostly negative before) and it's not quite the same as most of the other elder scrolls games preceding it (although a fresh approach was definitely nice!) you know the layout I'm talking about: run around, help rando's find their lost kitty, help other rando's assassinate their cheating spouse, accomplish side quests for factions that may or may not be more fun than the main quest which you never know if it will end up being very underwhelming and/or tedious, but at least feeling like the money spent on the game had been worth it...\nTESO has definitely been all those things and , I feel, totally worth it. It has all those elements quintessentially elder scrolls with that odd [to me] ♥♥♥♥♥♥meplay style that lends something fresh to the elder scrolls experience.\nSometimes other players can be of noxious and even downright rude, but my experience has been that the overwhelming majority of them are helpful or just leave you alone to do your thing in Tamriel, and there are countless guilds to join up with, meet new friends who love the elder scrolls series as much as you do, or or for you to teach them how!\nI definitely recommend this amalgamation of MMO and elder scrolls to anyone looking to experience the series for the first time and for seasoned older scrolls fans alike. I won't pretend it's perfect, and there are plenty of things I wish it had that it doesn't, but at the end of the day this exists for entertainment and when I'm asked if I am not entertained, I must say I absolutely am, every time I log on!","March 7","true","7.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Have you played every single game? Great, because you don't need any of those things to play this game and get into it. For myself, I only casualled have played Oblvion and SKyrim- so I came into ESO with pratiically no background other then there were cool playible races.\n\nCompaired to other current generation MMOs out on the market this game is beautiful, interactive, lore and story drive, and has great solo/group play opprotuntiies. The mechnices of the game make sense for the setting and tie in nicely together without leaving a player fustrated at figuring out how to gear or craft.\n\nTh only down side to this game compaired to other MMos is the lack of a classic PVP sense. Supposedly that will change this year in content patches, but for now the only PVP is an open world constant pvp system much like World vs World vs World in GW2. Only its just one big server, against itself in three factions. At that, there is one bloated faction with some slight map advantage, then two weenie factions. So until they can get that straight, PVP in this game is a resounding 'meh' for those players like myself that like quick fast past small match team based games (looking at you with heart eyes  SWTOR).\n\nThe costuming system is great, the game is mod friendly. The graphics are beauitful. The community is active and vibrate for all sorts of play styles and needs. But most importaintly the devs are actualy doing stuff to add content to the game. Already in the middle of 2016 and it's had two drops that have added SO MUCH to the game (Thieves Guild, Assassins Guild), and before that it's had other content drops/quaility of life pers since it went free to play.\n\nNew players, returning players- I strongly recomend to give this game a good long hard look and enjoy it.\n","May 29","true","432.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It walks its own path, plays well, it's unique in many aspects, but it fails to stand out from the crowd. Unfortunately from what it seems, there was some bad communication here. Some people expected a skyrim online and they certainly had a point. It looks like skyrim, plays like skyrim, but it's not skyrim. I would have preferred a more original game based on tes lore, rather than a skyrimish one, failing to please the majority. Yet, the game's wonderful. Here's what great with it:\n\nPros\n+Visually beautiful. Fantastic lighting.\n+Play in Tamriel like you never did before.\n+Feels closer to old morrowind, at least a lot more than previous 2 tes titles.\n+Great quests, good stories, makes you wanna fight at your pact's side.\n+Music!\n+Pvp. It's just awesome!\n+Crafting. At last crafting that makes sense. The best gear in game it's the one that's crafted. Followed by the ones you find adventuring, followed by the ones ventors sell. And you don't have to wait to be legendary, that happens from the starting lvls. So everyone's get a fair choice. Those you like crafting and those who don't.\n\nAnd here's why i kept scratching my head:\n\nCons\n-Not very original loses first impressions. From the very first minutes feels like a poor man's skyrim.\n-Very repeatable buildings, fauna. A classic tes approach..lol\n-Needs some more mmorpg mechanisms like housing, more end game content, etc.\n-Price is very high, especially for a year old game.\n-Some decisions seem...lazy (like in most tes titles:). For example, the technology is right there, yet they chose to make the invasions so small it somewhat breaks the immersion. Npc's eating food as it is and a general lack of variety. Animations and things.\n\nNo matter the high price, you'll get your money's worth. And while you're doing that, take a piece of advice to anyone who's interested : Try to play the game like a tes game and not like an mmo. Walk instead of run, especially in towns and take your time. This isn't a game to rush to endgame, you'll miss a big chunk of fun this way. Enjoy the ride, don't rush to destination.\n\nUpdate 18/01/2016\nAfter more than 340 hours played, i can honestly say this is one of the best mmo's and games in general that i have ever played. Pvp's fantastic, skill tree is magnificient, crafting is great and the economy is troll and gold-seller free. Oh and there are virtualy no bots, well since the economy is very restricted for the player's sake. I hope they'll keep it this way, i'd hate to see a trade post where everything that matters would turned overnight into a gold thing.\n\nA solid 10/10 from me. It's not the best mmo and it could be better. But it's awesome as it is.","May 15, 2015","true","564.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I have put more time into this game in 3 months than most games over a year. The quests have compelling storylines, and you can make decisions that actually alter the outcome. The variety of equipment is a huge draw, and combat is exciting. You can customize any of the four classes to do pretty much anything you want, be it damage, healing or tanking, and the number of class, weapon and guild abilities allow for tons of customization and optimization. Best of all, you can rebuild your character for a modest amount of in game gold if you don't like the direction it's going. The game has good graphics, especially for an mmo. I'm a bit dissappointed that the dark brotherhood is going to be released as dlc rather than base game content but that's a bit more of a criticism of the industry in general rather than this game specifically. Overall I would highly recommend this game and see myself putting in many more hours over the coming years.","November 15, 2015","true","111.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Even zone chat (general/trade chat if you play WoW) isn't just cluttered with nonsense and chinese spammers.

With the $15 subscription the game was not worth it at all. You might be looking at the steam reviews (if they are still this way, otherwise ignore this bit) "why is it mixed?" most people reviewed the game before it went B2P. Skip to the bottom for a shorter review\n\nI'd like to change my original thoughts of the game from "Garbage" to "Pretty Good." The game is still missing some things, it's fun to play if you're a TES fan and the B2P makes it worth it to play. I'll list things below and what I like and disliked while playing.\n\nCOMBAT\n+ Animations are fluid and don't give the same "rubbing" feeling like in the Beta, my character and enemies reacted to hits.\n+ skills worked well together and combat was efficient, Ex. if an enemy charges an attack I can block or interrupt or roll out of the way then smack them around with weapons/skills\n+ Enemies are challenging but not too easy or too difficult\n- animations get kinda wonky sometimes, especially in first person. I'd recommend third person\n\nSTORY/QUESTS\n+ Quests are varried and interesting\n+ Interesting dialogue, you're gonna skip through quests quickly and have no idea what's going on if you spam through dialogue so I'd suggest against it the first time around.\n+ The game forces you to take your time with storylines (Main, Fighter's, Mage's)\n- a little too many runner quests but not a huge amount.\n\nGRAPHICS\n+ NPCs and Characters look really nice, much better than Skyrim IMHO. humanoid races are a little meh compared to Argonian and Khajiit though\n+ game is really pretty, hanging around Morrowind or Summerset Isles is beautiful.\n+ textures look pretty nice for an MMO to some they can be kinda low quality.\n- armors look a little too similar.\n\nINTERACTIONS/PVP\n+ I never once felt like anyone else was important, to me they were just random adventurers or people who were helping me do a quest. They'd come in, help and then run off and never see them again\n+ Most players have very TES style names. I didn't see a lot of "XxV3NG3NC3xX" players.\n+Players are very friendly and will answer any questions or help if you ask them.\n+ PvP is really fun but you need a good build else you'll get stomped.\n- at times there a little too many people in one place but that's what you get with an MMO\n- more fun with friends\n\nOVERALL\n+ Great gameplay\n+ Rewarding quests\n+ Player interactions are enjoyable\n+ good graphic fidelity\n- more fun with friends\n- doesn't give quite the same feeling as other TES games.\n\nOverall, if you're a big TES fan and like or don't mind the MMO format you should definitly give it a shot, if you're on the fence wait for a steam sale if they have one. If you're not into MMO style games or like to play singleplayer more and have no one to play with I'd probably say pass.\n\n7.5/10\n"Room for Improvement"","March 25, 2015","true","118.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

And at release it was a bit dodgy, but I tried it since it went B2P and it was solid, no crashing or DC's and no quests that bugged out (all happened way too much at release).\n\nThe worst thing about this game is likely how the skills work, at like level 20 you have all your skill slots full and then all you do is make them all more powerfull passively, and the 'wow moments' really are not a part of this game at all.. Hell you can respec I guess, if you want to pay (igc) for it, but again you will just fill your skill bar and level those skills up fairly passively again. I'd really like the ability to have more abilities.. And not be penalized.. Like, you can put points into a bunch of different stuff and switch them around, but them your not maxing out your skills so your doing less damage etc.. So your really forced to focus on a good build and stick with it.. I'd much rather not have skill points at all, and just give everyone access to every skill and just level them by using them :/\n\nAnyway, still, worth checking out, if the games on special, not really worth the 60-80$..

I have put more time into this game in 3 months than most games over a year. The quests have compelling storylines, and you can make decisions that actually alter the outcome. The variety of equipment is a huge draw, and combat is exciting. You can customize any of the four classes to do pretty much anything you want, be it damage, healing or tanking, and the number of class, weapon and guild abilities allow for tons of customization and optimization. Best of all, you can rebuild your character for a modest amount of in game gold if you don't like the direction it's going. The game has good graphics, especially for an mmo. I'm a bit dissappointed that the dark brotherhood is going to be released as dlc rather than base game content but that's a bit more of a criticism of the industry in general rather than this game specifically. Overall I would highly recommend this game and see myself putting in many more hours over the coming years.","November 15, 2015","true","111.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It walks its own path, plays well, it's unique in many aspects, but it fails to stand out from the crowd. Unfortunately from what it seems, there was some bad communication here. Some people expected a skyrim online and they certainly had a point. It looks like skyrim, plays like skyrim, but it's not skyrim. I would have preferred a more original game based on tes lore, rather than a skyrimish one, failing to please the majority. Yet, the game's wonderful. Here's what great with it:\n\nPros\n+Visually beautiful. Fantastic lighting.\n+Play in Tamriel like you never did before.\n+Feels closer to old morrowind, at least a lot more than previous 2 tes titles.\n+Great quests, good stories, makes you wanna fight at your pact's side.\n+Music!\n+Pvp. It's just awesome!\n+Crafting. At last crafting that makes sense. The best gear in game it's the one that's crafted. Followed by the ones you find adventuring, followed by the ones ventors sell. And you don't have to wait to be legendary, that happens from the starting lvls. So everyone's get a fair choice. Those you like crafting and those who don't.\n\nAnd here's why i kept scratching my head:\n\nCons\n-Not very original loses first impressions. From the very first minutes feels like a poor man's skyrim.\n-Very repeatable buildings, fauna. A classic tes approach..lol\n-Needs some more mmorpg mechanisms like housing, more end game content, etc.\n-Price is very high, especially for a year old game.\n-Some decisions seem...lazy (like in most tes titles:). For example, the technology is right there, yet they chose to make the invasions so small it somewhat breaks the immersion. Npc's eating food as it is and a general lack of variety. Animations and things.\n\nNo matter the high price, you'll get your money's worth. And while you're doing that, take a piece of advice to anyone who's interested : Try to play the game like a tes game and not like an mmo. Walk instead of run, especially in towns and take your time. This isn't a game to rush to endgame, you'll miss a big chunk of fun this way. Enjoy the ride, don't rush to destination.\n\nUpdate 18/01/2016\nAfter more than 340 hours played, i can honestly say this is one of the best mmo's and games in general that i have ever played. Pvp's fantastic, skill tree is magnificient, crafting is great and the economy is troll and gold-seller free. Oh and there are virtualy no bots, well since the economy is very restricted for the player's sake. I hope they'll keep it this way, i'd hate to see a trade post where everything that matters would turned overnight into a gold thing.\n\nA solid 10/10 from me. It's not the best mmo and it could be better. But it's awesome as it is.","May 15, 2015","true","564.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The graphics are extreamly immersive and the game offers a massive world for you to play in. Furthermore each town and city is built with indervidualirty and you can even preform small tasks to top up your coin, such as creating amour (which can be done once a day). The game also runs with little lag and at great speed. There is a great varity of missions too and a great online pvp area where you fight for control over castles however there arew two limitiations. the 1st is that you cannot buy a horse without a lot of in game money or by purchasiung one via the store. This means that you spend a lot of time wanding from place to place (as you can only teliport from certain locations). This can become particaully irritating in pvp mode. My second point is that the game is not as interactive as those before it.

It's mostly free to play after you buy the game.\n\n2. It gives a good sense of Skyrim, Morrowind, Oblivion, and all in between, mixed into the MMORPG Genre.\n\n3. It gives hope to those who wanted a multiplayer version of Skyrim, (and some of Oblivion.)\n\n4. It mixes well with the other games in the MMORPG genre, being one of the many open world ones, where you can do what you want.\n\n5. The faction war system. 3 races per faction, and each one battles with players from level 10 and up.\n\n6. The four classes are very fun to play as, decimating your enemies as quick as possible.\n\nCons.\n\n1. The Crownshop has DLC, but you need to buy crowns to get it, instead of straight up buying the DLC.\n\n2. The Story Quests, go on for a long time, leaving little time for you to do sidequests, and by the time you are able to, you're too overpowered.\n\n3. Some of the dungeons you go to early in the game are way too hard without a friend, especially if you don't have friends.\n\n4. The game has a lacking of weapons that you can use, and some you get that don't fit your class.\n\n5.

I guess some people didn't find the Elder Scrolls magic in this one, but I was the other way around. I loved Skyrim, but think this one is even more fun to play (as do others within the game). I go back through Skyrim now with a greater appreciation, though.\n\nMost of the gripes I had starting out have been resolved. I think some people will still have trouble with the end game being so far away (you have to quest through all three factions first), but with the subscription dropping, you won't find more game for the money. The questing is superior, and there are group dungeons, public dungeons, private dungeons, dolmens (like rifts kinda), mini dolmens, and lots of world bosses. Each zone has a pretty epic finishing quest along with the main story quests and two guild questlines. I've been playing over 500 hours and still haven't seen everything.","March 4, 2015","true","073.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I doubt you'll play it for the entire duration of the game, but there is 60$ worth of entertainment out of the box. ESO could be one of the greats if they only adjusted a few minor things. Here goes what I suggest they do to "complete" the Elder Scrolls experience.\n\n1) Once the game is beaten, scale all low level content to the player's level. If you're lvl 50 in a lvl 1 zone, the zone should be adjusted to lvl 50. The only excdeption would be if a low lvl friending invited you to help him, then you would enter his world-space. The fundamentals of this are already in place via Megaserver tech.\n\n2) Remove faction boundries and let all players go anywhere in the world. Make Cyrodill a Guild Vs.

Not a-lot has to be done here. Other tweaks such as Morrowind/Oblivion style crafting are now implementable. Since all zones/content is now end-game content, making crafting more in line with Skyrim or Oblivion than it is currently starts to make sense.\n\nWhat is my reasoning behind these three major changes? Well, it would turn ESO into a full-on Elder Scrolls game instead of an MMO set in the Elder Scrolls universe. Right now I can only experience high level versions of opposing factoin conetnt, not my own. It would give me a reason to go back and explore other areas in a way that seems natural to an Elder Scrolls game. It would let me team up with players from other factions and it would make Cyrodill three times larger and that much more interesting. It's the right thing for the game.\n\nNow, how to package and deliver this? I would suggest making most or all of this a free update, but if development costs soar and you need some return on the investment, I would suggest selling it as a "Veteran Content Upgrade" for say 3000 crowns.

Every where I asked people talked about how bad the game is, but it's not, it's alot of fun.\n\nOne of the main complaints I remember seeing was that it doesn't feel like an Elder Scrolls game, and I disagree completely, it definitely feels like I'm playing elder scrolls, the world and the characters around me help to solidify where I am.

I got on the ESO hate-wagon and said I would never buy it blah blah. I believed the game would fail and that going free-to-play meant the end of it blah blah. But I also hate WoW so I think most my hate stemmed from the subscription cost, which has been gone for a week now :).\n\nWhy I Bought: It was spring break, had the cash, had no plans, why not spend $60 on a game just so I could make fun of?\n\nAfter the Buy: My mind is blown at how good this game is. There are a few games that make me spend 60+ hours and counting on it. All the people hating on this game need to play it before they hate on it, and the people who still hate it after playing do have a right to state their opinion and MMO's just aren't for everyone.\n\nGraphics: 10/10 when compared to other MMO's, but 7/10 compared to other games. This game actually looks like a game and not just a bunch of low-polygon, texturized, low-budged, 3D film characters running around. The game is also diverse enough that you don't feel like you are looking at the same building, tree, rock, etc. over and over again.\n\nLore: 9/10, ESO dives into the Elder Scrolls lore which is quite rich when you consider that the Elder Scrolls games start back in the 90's with the release of Arena. There is so much to read if you take the time to read it, but that is the downside as well. I would also dare to say that Elder Scrolls has a richer lore than WoW.\n\nAction Bar: 8/10, the action bar is really frustrating with it only having 5 skills and 1 ultimate. But when you consider how devastating the skills can be if you arrange them correctly it does make sense. PvP would be at a permanent dead lock if a class had more than 5 skills equipped (my dragon knight would be an unstoppable tank if I could use all the defensive and offensive skills).\n\nCombat: 8/10, it brings the Elder Scrolls feel in how you can use any weapon no matter what class you are. Though classes do favor some weapons over the other in how well the weapon meshes with the class skills. Also the collision detection is phenomenal, I have yet to get frustated by a phantom reach (cough cough DARK SOULS cough cough). There is a solidness to the combat as well, each hit resonates with a solid strike, blocking a strong attack offsets the enemy, attacking an offset enemy makes them crumble to the ground, it is a satisfying combat experience.\n\nPlayer Base: 10/10, I have played games that were populated by ***hole players but so far I am always satisfied with interactions had. Players are willing to converse while out doing a dungeon together, are willing to help out quite readily, and there is very little rage quitting.\n\nJustice System: 8/10, I enjoy this part of the game and how it gives you a break from the general mechanics of it. When I first started the game I went and stole myself a nice set of armor, a shiny sword, and then sold the rest of the loot to a fence. Also attacking NPC's can be hilarious, I broke into a house and the owner was being annoying, but beware that only a few NPC's are killable so sorry trolls and griefers.\n\nLooting: 6/10, I will admit that gaining gold is really frustrating. Little gold is actually dropped and you get most of it from selling your loot. If you deconstruct your loot you can turn it into a lot more gold if you invest into crafting. In dungeons each player has their own instances of loot and there is no rolling for the best item at the end of it (I like this aspect a lot).\n\nLeveling: 5/10, I am frustrated with the level system. Leveling is easy until you reach 30 because it seems after level 30 players stop doing dungeons and just go to Cyrodil (PvP); doing dungeons was the easiest way to level up. Also allocating your skill points is a pain with how strategic you have to be, but to be fair it is really fun to strategize on how to allocate points to optimize your build.\n\nOverall: 8/10, I am reccomending this game to all my friends who all think it is still a horrible game but it has recovered nicely. I am looking forward to more adventures in Tamriel and to more of the map opening up (maybe?) because I would love to roleplay with my dunmer in Morrowwind.\n\nP.S. There is a lot more to the game than what I have reviewed. I have just done a review on the aspects that I use the most. I am not a crafter so I don't think I am qualified to review the crafting system and same goes for joining guilds, I am a solo player.","March 24, 2015","true","130.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It has a brilliant soundtrack and realistic graphics, but it's the little things that I like the most. For example, the small quests are actually really interesting, just like Skyrim. I was looking around Daggerfall one time and I saw this cool looking Cathedral, so I went inside it. A priest was giving a speech about the gods, and when I tried to speak to people they told me to be quiet as they were trying to listen. Even the stained glass windows told a story about the Gods. For some reason I love the detail in games because it shows that the people who made it were really trying to make it seem realistic.

If you're looking for a skyrim v2 then you can stop reading my review instantly as that's not what you're going to get out of ESO. ESO is a MMORPG with great graphics, soundtrack, exploration, quests, PvP and so on. There is so much content involved in ESO that the new dlcs released every now and again offer over hours and hours of new content for each player. Having 3 pacts is wise as it cancels out a generic 1v1 pact vs pact mentality as you have Aldmeri Dominion, Ebonheart Pact and finally Daggerfall Covenant. The quest lines are solid enough to keep you engaged and if you're a solo player then look no futher than this game as it offers a vast majority of solo content as far as crafting and PvE go. This game isn't pay 2 win at all as for example when you enter PvP you're counted already as a veteran ranked player which makes gameplay less one sided for a player. All in all I can easily recommend this game as a top 5 MMORPG in the world today matching qualities with games such as GW2 and WoW. I give ESO a great 9.5/10","September 3, 2015","true","640.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I am going to keep this short and sweet.\n\nI followed this game for the year that it was out and decided against it. The reason's I chose to not get the game were due to the terrible reviews and supposedly they veered away from the original Elder Scrolls gameplay. (No stealing, pick pocketing, killing villagers. The stuff you play Elder Scrolls for.)\nThis caused me to not think about the game for a good six months.\n\nTwo major new systems have been implemented in this update: The Justice System and The Champion System. With Justice, crime has come to the once-friendly streets of Tamriel's cities. You can now become a wanted criminal, sneaking, stealing, and even murdering your way through the world. But be careful—the guards can and will seek to punish you if your crimes are witnessed.\n\nThe Champion System gives players with Veteran characters a new way to gain power. Once you have a Veteran Rank character on your account, you'll start earning Champion Points, which you can invest in a variety of new passive abilities.\n\nThat's not all Update 6 has to offer! they've completely overhauled provisioning. You'll notice new recipes and much more inventory space as a result of our updating and streamlining. There's also a new way to keep track of your mounts, pets, and costumes: the Collections Window because you can access everything you've earned through the new UI at any time.\n\nThat basically covers the biggest changes since the buy to play change. Since all the updates it genuinely feels like its single-player predecessors rather than a cookie cutter MMO, and that in itself is enough to draw me back into the game for many, many more hours!\n\n\n10/10, this game is a must buy now!","May 17, 2015","true","320.5"," 25 of 46 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","25","46","3","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mychaelo/recommended/306130/","mychaelo","mychaelo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mychaelo/","129 products in account","Verdict: cautious recommendation. Buy it if it's on sale, but not at full price (for now, at least).\n\nUpsides:\n+ Art: Environment Design is mostly up there on par with Skyrim (and sometimes even more imaginative, as devs were not afraid to use the vertical space to their advantage). Textures are generally nice, though they could use an optional "HD texture pack". Though I also understand that said pack would make the installation weigh more than a hundred gigs, and would be a nightmare to update. Lighting system is quite impressive, and lits the interiors way better than, say, Skyrim engine would, shadows interact with lights in numerous ways and are always dynamic - all this results in a remarkable picture, even if some shaders are a bit basic.\n+ Script: I can safely say that I met a whole lot more memorable characters in TES:Online than I had in TES5. Apart from defined characters, a good dose of humour is applied even in some dramatic situations, like, for example, when you meet a vampire cat /ahem, khajiit/, who tries to save last few villagers from being eaten alive, and she is distracted by a thought of yarn. In spite of some players crying "DEY BROKE DA LORE" "DEY RUENED DA ALDUR SCRULS" I didn't see many violations, more so considering how inconsistent the 'canon' lore is. Cyrodiil still has no jungles, but that has more to do with Bethesda's decision during TES4 development than anything else. The so-called 'Main quest' is used more like a plot device in order to explain some events in the game world, though it does have its bright moments too.\n+ Voice-over: the amount of dialogue is immense, and it's fully voiced in its entirety. While there are few characters, who will make you cringe (that last Ayleid king, urrrgh), there are more than a few splendid jobs (even Sheogorath, which is not voiced by the original actor, but is still totally fine).\n+ PvP as idea: Having a full-fledged war with melee weapons, siege machinery and thousands of participants - looks great on paper. Too bad that this concept is undermined by balance and stability issues. More on those below.\n+ UI modding system: TES5 had a fair share of UI mods (mostly due to its UI being console-oriented in the first place). TES:Online supports this kind of mods as well with per-character settings, so if you don't like something about the interface, there's generally "a mod for that": mini-maps, map markers, HUD overhauls, trading helpers, combat macros and whatnot.\n+ Amount of content: while you have to choose your starting ("home" so to speak) faction, you'll eventually get access to the zones of other factions as well. And it really does feel like three games worth of content (or time you spend on them at least).\n\nNow on to some YMMW things (you might like these, you might hate these):\n~ Subscription model: it has its own upsides and downsides, huge upside being no teenage trolls spamming in chat or doing /playdead + /pushups on the town square (like they did in open beta). Downside being that by paying a fixed amount of money you won't necessarily get a steady amount of content (in fact, the only big content addition to the game was Craglorn). Arguably there's no better model choice - and most certainly I wouldn't want this game to become Free-to-Play.\n~ Character models: yes, mouth animations are finally added in Update 5, so people don't look like sock puppets. They still look like dolls, though. Just a pair of skin/eye shaders would work wonders here, but it seems like devs don't want to increase the budget even for close-up shots.\n~ Skillbar ala Warcraft 3: five skills + Ulti, with additional second bar after Level 15. Unlike in TES5, you cannot dual-wield a spell and a weapon. In fact, you don't actually have any spells. Instead you have abilities, which might or might not be magical, and may produce various types of damage or have other effects on you, your allies or your enemies. So in short, Warcraft 3. DEY RUENED DA ALDUR SCRULS. Yeah, right.\n~ Game is overpopulated: you heard it correctly, and no, it's not a LITERELY DED GAEM by any means. So good luck finishing any dungeon on your own - more often than not you'll get inside just to find half of it already decimated by players, who got in a few minutes before you. On the other hand, you'll have no issues with finding a party. Party will find YOU, comrade.\n\nAnd at last, let's discuss the flaws:\n- The world is static. Your actions may have only a few different outcomes: a) enemies disappear from the area b) enemies become non-hostile in the area c) area is not changed in any way. No crumbling cities, no dynamic objects (the about only example of those is sky anchor, which pops every 10 minutes in predefined places), game sometimes tries to mitigate it by sending you into 'fake' zone, which becomes a 'true' zone once you complete the quest and return to it. To be fair, the devs did use a few dynamic objects in the main quest line, but that's far too few.\n- Justice (absence of it). Second-era Tamriel is populated with communists. No possession, no stealing, no jails. From each according to his ability, to each according to his need. This also means no Thieves Guild, no Dark Brotherhood, no Morag-Tong. Devs promised to introduce this system in one of the upcoming updates, so this might change in the future.\n- PvP in current implementation: when it works, it's an okay experience. You deploy siege machines, employ cover-up and deceit tactics, ambush the reinforcements et cetera. The key is 'when it works'. Game uses several servers (called Campaigns), with most players going to Thornblade. It's almost always population-locked on evenings, but that's not the main concern. Once you get inside, be ready to meet the almighty LAG. While the in-game counter breaks upon latency >1 s, the actual lag spike in >30 x >30 battles may freeze everyone in place (while you still can move around, that's an illusion made by lag compensation system) for up to several minutes. Thus taking any given fort may become an impossible feat even with prevailing forces. Currently some guilds have decided to just ditch the Thornblade and play on alternative servers. Though those might have some lag spikes time-to-time, but not any of same scale as Thornblade. Again, devs promised to fix these issues in upcoming updates, but until then this remains a flaw.\n- You can't make a bad guy character. Also, you have a choice. But really, you don't: this probably applies to the last two TES games as well, but yeah, it still is a flaw. Your choice is in most cases reduced to dialogue options before being given a reward, and generally only decides if that one character will greet you upon your final appearance in the current zone. Again, nothing out of ordinary for TES series, yet still.\n- Autoleveling (absence of it). Okay, the TES4 was disliked by many for this, but TES5 used autoleveling to its advantage - if you go into a cave at Level 50, be prepared to meet bandits in glass armour or Draugr deathlords. In TES:Online if you go to, say, Glenumbra, to do some quests you missed, while you are already past Level 20, you'll find it extremely easy. In fact, many do miss the 'Bad man hallows' public dungeon, and when they return from the next zone to complete it, players just molest everyone inside. Another example: you completed every available group dungeon and played a few evenings in PvP zone. Then you return to usual questing and discover, that you are 5-6 levels above than the quest enemies/rewards. This means you get little to no items/experience for your activity, and basically robbed yourself of potentially good items, as they don't drop if you're more than 5 levels above your victims. The last update did fix some of the leveling issues, mainly with solo/group-only content.","November 29, 2014","true","16.6"," 27 of 50 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","27","50","0","0"

Honestly, im not quite sure where this game gets the hate. I joined the game skeptical like all of you, not knowing if Id like it. When the game dropped its monthly sub, I decided what the heck Ill try it! Let me tell you, this game is single handedly the best MMORPG I have played. Having played WoW for 6 years, I know what it takes for an MMO to have great potential and this game has it. Many say its not like Skyrim, but infact it is every great thing Skyrim offered plus so much more. The graphics are stunning on max, the combat is very interactive (block, dodge and non target) just as is in Skyrim. You have all the freedom in this MMO as you do in Skyrim, and with 60gb of content, surely you will NEVER get bored. The game encourages you to roam the map and explore, while at the same time questing or doing dungeons with friends has great benefits as well. Over all I have had no complaints, and dont be intimidated by the player base on steam, where as most of the people who bought this game bought it off the website and has some 700k active players. All in all, if you are curious about this game try it! You will not be dissapointed.","March 20, 2015","true","121.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","4"

(i am lvl 11 a the time i am wrighting this) but i have to say it is actully quite fun despite the hate it is given. it still doesnt match the normal Elder Scrolls experiance, but if you go in expecting a MMO instead of a multiplayer skyrim, oblivion, or Morrowind experiance it is quite enjoyible. i so far have had a lot of fun on it. though i would not have reccomended it being with a Sub based MMO they have turned of the Subscription so i must say Good job Bethesda and zenimax thanks .as for the downsides first of is a thing most people pointed out .The need to pay an extra 20 to ply as an imperial i think is just dumb and not right for TES at any time ever .also the gold in this takes forever to make seeing that the enemys only drop a measly 6 gold most of the time .the lack of random thingys to explore in the wild also is bad and makes into a "Walking simulator" without a horse,we just need some nice caves to explore or castle to pillage without random non quest related place to explore it just doesnt feel Elder scrolls and takes a lot of fun that there could have been away.i dont think i have any thing left to say so i hope you guys like this game like i did and thanks for reading this Bye:   Overall rating  (Drumroll) 7/10","March 20, 2015","true","278.5"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

Personally when I play, I feel like I am playing a single player game in which I can call for aid if I need it from other players. On that note, the community is amazing!

Then it came on sale for £16 (let's face it, 50 quid for a subscription game is far too expensive) so I finally bought it, and wow, am I glad I did. Full of Eldery Scrolly awesomeness, fantastic questlines, decent crafting, and a great community (so far). The game runs really well on my mediocre system, and looks really nice. There's so much to do, see, and explore at the moment, but I haven't hit endgame yet. I love to level slowly and take in everything a game of this scope has to offer, and after playing all the TES games and expansions since Morrowind, this to me, is a great mmo edition to the series. So if you can afford to buy the game on sale, I highly recommend you give it a go.\n\n*Edit* The lack of subscription and new content has changed this game for the better. No worrying about if you can justify the sub fees, but also nice little bonuses if you do want to sub for a month. The PVP is fanstastic, both Cyrodil and the Imperial Sewers. Cyrodil is massive open world warfare. Get a group, siege castles, And steal your enemies elder scrolls. Seriously, it is one of the most fun pvp systems I've played in an mmo. The Imperial Sewers pvp is a little different. It's small narrow corridors with pve thrown in and it keeps you on your toes. There is definitely a sense of satisfaction in seeing a few enemy players fighting a boss and going over and messing with them. All in all, I recommend this whole heartedly.","December 29, 2014","true","078.7"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","1"

Then it came on sale for £16 (let's face it, 50 quid for a subscription game is far too expensive) so I finally bought it, and wow, am I glad I did. Full of Eldery Scrolly awesomeness, fantastic questlines, decent crafting, and a great community (so far). The game runs really well on my mediocre system, and looks really nice. There's so much to do, see, and explore at the moment, but I haven't hit endgame yet. I love to level slowly and take in everything a game of this scope has to offer, and after playing all the TES games and expansions since Morrowind, this to me, is a great mmo edition to the series. So if you can afford to buy the game on sale, I highly recommend you give it a go.\n\n*Edit* The lack of subscription and new content has changed this game for the better. No worrying about if you can justify the sub fees, but also nice little bonuses if you do want to sub for a month. The PVP is fanstastic, both Cyrodil and the Imperial Sewers. Cyrodil is massive open world warfare. Get a group, siege castles, And steal your enemies elder scrolls. Seriously, it is one of the most fun pvp systems I've played in an mmo. The Imperial Sewers pvp is a little different. It's small narrow corridors with pve thrown in and it keeps you on your toes. There is definitely a sense of satisfaction in seeing a few enemy players fighting a boss and going over and messing with them. All in all, I recommend this whole heartedly.","December 29, 2014","true","078.7"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","1"

I recomend playing Morrowind and Oblivion before giving this game a try, Get in touch with the lore, and know the facts. If you played Daggerfall you will remember something called a Dragon Break" basiclly all endings are cannon. Since in every other Scrolls game NEVER mention the existance of Ebonheart and Daggerfall alliances, Lets asume the AD won the war and we fall into their time line where we`ve played all the TES games.\n\nEnough lore, now to the game overall,\n\nthe game does have its flaws, and it is getting better ZOS is a active company, they listen to the players, they fixed almost ALL the bugs. DO NOT look at the past reviews of this game, it HAS gotten better.\n\nGraphics wise this game is amazing, seriously try to find a game that is as detailed and huge as this game, right now this game is almost 50gb Tamriel is HUGE,\n\nP2P: Honestly i like it, people do not waste your time, they`re to the point help, the comunity is amazing ive met so many nice people.\n\nSound: Damn, it sounds great,music is good, the voice acting sometimes is a bit rough, some voices dont fit the characters, but ALL of them stick to the lore and roots of this TES, Khajiits saying "this one" and "Raz will go...", Red-Guards, they are actually Pirates and sea go`ers (basiclly the navy). Argonians and their stories and accents.\n\nThe Bad: some abilites dont really explain them selves correctly, for example the Dragon Knights ability Dragon Claws, cannot root flying enemies\n\n-Some sort of a grind, but you do level up at a steady pace (1-6 times a day, then you hit Veteran Rank and its more complex)\n\noverall i give this game a 8.5/10\n\nit did so many things right, but the gruoping system is a bit off and the out off place voice acting for a few (like 3) characters made me give this game a 8.5/10","January 1, 2015","true","663.9"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

Unfortunately my favorite weapon (the bow)has been turned into a long range spell cast sort of, a major turn off for me, just my opinion.\n\nSo those are my immediate takes on this game so far, I am not a power leveling person, nor am I the ultimate build sort of player, I am the type of player that aimlessly wanders around looking for shiny things and seeing how far I can wander and what I can find. I just sort of play a character, and dont necissarily have an end goal. So far I am really enjoying this game, so it is not as immersive or as deep as the single player E.S. titles and as far as rating it as an mmo I dont play mmo so wouldnt know how bad this one is.....\nWhat I did notice right away is that although this game is not as deep as a typical es game there are some nice touches that I noticed right away and really liked, things like other players milling through a pack while looking at there inventory, or looking at a map when .... well looking at there map. Also the little animations when doing things like harvesting, or opening a container or auto unequiping weapons first... those are all things I have modded into skyrim! So those little details are nice.. Oh and footprints in the snow thats nice too. I have found books to read bugs to catch potions to brew, meals to prepare that do have some usefulness ( at least at this early stage) fishing, and of course what i feel is a nice ( compared to skyrim) expansion of crafting.\nI hear alot of people complain about how long it takes to get from one point to another, so they are upset the world is too big? Well for my personal taste i dont use fast travel in Skyrim so walking everywhere is no big deal to me I like to explore every nook and see every tree along the way collecting stuff between quests, and when my character deserves it or can afford it I will buy a horse.\nAny way thats my take on this game so far, I wont lie I only bought it because it was on sale, and hopefully it will remain entertaining through the upper levels.........Oh and I guess I should say so far I really like the look of the game too, not over the top but very nice ! and being able to hide the hud is nice too...... i guess its the little things.","November 27, 2014","true","26.5"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/akselmo/recommended/306130/","akselmo","Akselmo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/akselmo/","339 products in account","This review is a bit outdated, since it's based on before 1.6 patch.\n1.6. patch removed sub fees, added crown store and added justice system and champion system into the game. It also made many tiny areas of the game a lot better, such as animations and provisioning has now better named items, and yes you can fish yourself a meal now.\n\nThis review still matches my opinion about the game, but now the game feels -a lot better- than back when I wrote this review originally.\n\n----\nI honestly don't understand why people hate on it so much. As an Elder Scrolls fan who loves the crap out of Morrowind, this seems like a fair MMO in TES world. I like it, the exploration is fun and no restrictions when it comes to building a character, apart of the class skillset. For example, you can make a heavy armor sorcerer who uses bows. Silly and cool combinations can be made. You can also play as a brawler, but they don't have weapon skills. You just gotta rely on your fists with that one.\n\nCombat is tons of fun, I see myself doing it a lot instead of trying to avoid it like in some MMO's. Justice system is great fun and adds thievery in ESO. I suggest reading more about it from the ESO website. This game is also a lot more immersive than other MMO's I've played.\n\nWhat I could complain about is the default interface is a bit clunky, but luckily community has made some mods that solve the problem really well (thank you UI mod support!)\nThen there's also the blatant "shortcuts" and other lore-breaking stuff in the game, that come up at some points, but I'm enjoying the gameplay a lot so they don't bother me that much. (The three pacts thing is a bit silly but considering it was made because of PvP I understand it.)\nCyrodiil PvP can be a bit laggy sometimes, or thats what I've heard from North American players. As an EU player I haven't really seen any lag in Cyrodiil at all, but this is something no-one can predict.\n\nOtherwise, I love the rest of the game: Combat, exploration, modability, quests..\n\nIn retail copies I've seen "Exploration Pack" codes which let you make any race in any alliance, but they might come with this too. Those codes can be bought from Crown store, too. Crown store is basically cash shop, but I haven't seen any pay 2 win crap there, only costumes and skins for mounts.\n\nKeep in mind, the game is primarly an MMO, within TES universe. The gameplay is somewhat same as in other games, but still, in the core, it's an MMO and people shouldn't expect it to be like Skyrim.\n\nOh, be prepared for the 50 gb download! For some people it wasn't an issue, but for someone who doesn't have a good internet it WILL take a while. But for me it was worth the wait. If this can be an issue for you, get yourself a retail copy. :)","November 29, 2014","true","313.3"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

Many of the issues I saw in the initial reviews seem to be fixed. Also very excited for the upcoming justice system (even though I rarely play an evil typed character).\nIn conclusion I can see what some people might not like about it, but I think that it happened as part of becoming an MMO, if you look at it more like an MMO I dont find it to be bad at all.

Armies of revenants and dark spirits manifest in every corner of Tamriel. Winters grow colder and crops fail. Mystics are plagued by nightmares and portents of doom.\n\nFour years ago, in 2E 578, an arcane explosion of energy in the Imperial City set off mystical aftershocks that swept across Nirn. Mages died or went mad. Supernatural abominations from the plane of Oblivion, the Daedra, appeared in greater numbers than ever before. The constellation of the Serpent grew so large that it dominated the night sky.\n\nSo began the grand scheme of Molag Bal, Daedric Prince of domination and enslavement. His Dark Anchors, vortexes of evil magic, weaken the barrier between worlds, threatening to merge Nirn and Oblivion into a single, nightmarish hellscape.\n\nIn the midst of this chaos, three alliances vie for control of the Imperial City and the White-Gold Tower. High Rock, Sentinel, and Orsinium stand as one, united under the rule of the High King in Wayrest. Valenwood and Elsweyr have forged an alliance of their own with Summerset, while Black Marsh, Morrowind, and Skyrim have formed a third, uneasy pact.\n\nThe Daggerfall Covenant. The Aldmeri Dominion. The Ebonheart Pact.\n\nThree armies will take up arms against the Empire, and against each other, to wrest control of the Imperial City and White-Gold Tower from the dark forces of Oblivion itself.\n\nWhere will your loyalties lie ?\n\n\n(+)Graphics :  Graphics are absolutely amazing !! Yes , it is different from skyrim , but it is still amazing . There will be moments that you'll be staring at beautifully made architectures .\n\n(+)Soundtrack : Epic soundtrack with fast or slow tracks , perfectly fitted in to your current location . There is nothing more epic than Jeremy Soule playing while you slay through those skeletons .\n\n(+)Conversations :  Conversations are just like any other Elder Scrolls game . From time to time you'll be giving the options of either killing someone or showing mercy , taking a powerful artifact to gain its power for yourself or store it in a safe location away from the dangerous hands . Your actions will be shaping the future of your quests .\n\n(+)Story :  You're Vestige . A poor guy who's soul has been stolen by Molag Bol . After having your soul taken , and breaking out of a prison in Oblivion , you'll be hitting shores of one of the three available factions in the game . Each faction has different quests , different storylines . Each area has it's own problems , that only YOU can solve .\n\n(+)Content :  The content is huge .. There is questing which gets super fun with a friend , there are also dungeons and caves you can dive in to , fight special bosses , and clear them out with your friends . The content is pretty much the same as other Elder Scrolls games just made in to an online version .\n\n(+)PVP :  The pvp is one of the best features of this game . Three factions fight over the control of an area standing in the middle of each faction , Cyrodiil . You can form parties up to 16 people , ride your horses in to battle . Build catapults to tear down walls of enemy keeps in a huge map . Seriously it's huge , try walking around witout a horse .\n\n(+)Gameplay :  The gameplay is the best i have ever seen in an mmorpg before . This game literally made me a completionist . As I progressed through all the areas i was always like " I had to collect all the skyshards , I had to collect all the lorebooks , I must finish all quests , oh what's that a side quest about racing lizards ? Heck yeah i'm in. "\n\nThe fact that you can use a shield as a mage , or a staff as a rogue(these are not the names of the classes , but they're close to it) is a great function . You can be a wizard with heavy armor and a two-handed , or a fierce warrior with a destruction staff . Who knows , it's your destiny ..\n\n\n\nMy overall opinion on this game is that it's definitely worth the money . You'll enjoy every second of your gameplay . .\n\n10/10 -   Triskelion Turbella Reviews","November 22, 2014","true","363.4"," 61 of 117 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","61","117","0","0"

So "Playing with friends" could also be taken as a serious negative side. But that's what you get when you play MMO and you should expect it.\n\nPS. Oh and if you read reviews. Try to filter out those which are older than a few months. I found out that rather many of the reviews point out old information.

I've played almost every MMO in the past 14 years from Everquest 1 to Warhammer Online to Guild Wars 2 and even the pedophile dens like Dragon's Nest. I like a lot of people, got a really bad impression of what the game was from the mass beta invites they sent out early on to give people a taste. I think this hurt the game in the long run but about 25 hours in I'm really hoping that the steam release/sale does the game a lot of good for it's population.\n\nI'll start by saying that as soon as you get in you feel like you're in another Elder Scrolls game. Nameless prisoner destined for a greater good trying to escape some terrible event that leads up to the rest of the story. The UI is minimal and the scenery is pretty gorgeous. While the game can be played in third person I would never spoil my experience by leaving first. The immersion is on par with any FPSRPG that has some out in recent times and outside being able to steal spoons and place buckets on people's heads you have a lot of little details to pay attention to in the world.\n\nYou could honestly play this game as a single player ES game and be pretty content, but really the mega server system that they have has made it a great community as well. I've had a lot of good times just going out exploring or questing and finding other players on the same page as me. Similar to Guild Wars 2 everything has shared credit so you'll find people out and about and rather than resenting the people around you for "stealing spawns" you find yourself having people to group with on the most random of events.\n\nFor the thirty dollars I spent I couldn't be happier.

I feel that this should be addressed somewhat, but from a single-player perspective it's quite fun.\n\nMy recomendation is to play it like you would any other Elder Scrolls game, but don't expect the depth of interaction that you may be familiar with.  Exploration is key.","April 4, 2015","true","73.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I am writing this review because the peopl must know that this is infact a good game. Although the combat has changed once again (for better of for worse idk) what makes me love the elder scrolls games is still there. The thing that makes ne fall in love with these games is all the extra quests and the interaction with the npc's. As well as the freedom to play out the game as u wish for the most part. I'm still just a fresh player in EsO so i have yet to see the mmo side of the game. But playing the game as though it were single player so far has been great, i can eaisly say that the game is worth 70 dollars just from that point of view. So if your like me and love the adventure and love to go along helping all the npc's and getting sweet loots a gear then pick this game up. while i agree the dialog is lacking in comparason to older elder scrolls games i still manage to get sucked rite into the word of EsO.","April 8, 2015","true","155.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I started playing right before Tamriel unlimited came out (buy to play).\n\nThe good:\nI'm having a great time with this game so far. For me, it does have the feel of an elder scrolls game. I do play in first person, which may contribute to that.  The content is fairly engaging, and almost everything has voice actors. You're still put into positions where you have to make decisions that help make your character feel like it has more depth.\nLoot feels very rewarding because the game can be challenging (without being able to change the difficulty). With ESO now buy to play, I would say it's really worth the 60 bucks. Even if you only get 1 character to the level cap, it's going to provide you with hours upon hours of content and fun.\n\nThe bad:\n--Chat is the worst if you do not like spoilers. Every time I log in, there are spoilers in chat. You may just want to turn it off until finishing the story.\n--Fast travel is ultimately the same as it is with any of the other ES games, but it costs money in this one. The cost goes up based on how often you use it. While this is a great mechanic to get players to explore, it feels cumbersome when you are trying to get your bearings with the game and you are forced to either walk everywhere or keep broken equipment.\n--The durability of equipment is also a bit cumbersome. I feel like between every 3 or so quests that I need to repair because all of my stuff is broken. You're right in the middle of an engaging quest? Nope, pay money to go back to town and repair, then start all over again (Some quests are instanced).\n--PVP was just.. I don't even know. A friend brought me in, and within a minute of walking we found someone. We went to attack and like 50 other players appeared out of nowhere and wrecked us. (He is much more adept at this than I am). This trend continued for the next 20 or so minutes while I repeatedly was killed. I can say that I will not be putting any time into this component of the game.\n\n\n","April 9, 2015","true","25.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you love the Elderscrolls world, exploring every nook, discovering ancient lore, and experiencing content that has not existed since Arena you will enjoy this game.  If you love high paced castle destroying intense PVP and combat you will enjoy this game.  If you are looking  for Skyrim the MMO you may be disappointed.  If you are expecting the most amazing MMO experience ever (because it is Elderscrolls)... you may also be disapointed.  But as it stands Tamriel Unlimited is beginning to shine as long as you reel in your expectations a bit.\n\nMy praise lies in the the fact they have managed to craft a world that looks and feels overall like an Elder Scrolls.  My ventures into Morrowind had me tingling with that old feeling of romping through the cliffs of Vvardenfell.  Finally the quest lines in ESO feel much more epic and important than any other MMO I have played.  Not to mention that nearly every quest you encounter is in someway related to the main plot line, it sometimes may not be immediately apparent but I find makes it a much more immersive experience.  Finally combat is what you would expect from an Elderscrolls MMO, The feel of Skyrim as most reliably done on a Server client system.\n\nMy complaints are simple and for the most part superficial.  Hair... why oh why can't anyone over at Bethesda or Zenimax (and many other american game companies) make decent character hair.  A few extra polygons and texture resolution on such an incredibly important part of your experience is worth any kind of performance penalty I may suffer.  TES has squeaked by this since Morrowind thanks to the modding community but you don't have that in ESO.  Also no barber or character appearance changing ability at all which means if you choose a hair style you later find god ugly you are stuck with it.  I truly hope this gets changed later.\n\nFinally my one and only complaint.  The Character class system is amazingly limber, but in my opinion not necessary even in ESO.  You must choose one of 4 classes that imparts a set of class based skills and magic.  Your choices in constructing that character's abilities as it levels can turn them into a tank, a healer, a powerful magic damage dealer or some combination of the above.  But I can't help but feel it is unnecessary.  There are plenty of skills you acquire throughout the game world, why can't a similar system be used uniformly throughout the game.  Weather you are a Templar, Dragon Knight, Nightblade, or Sorcerer you can be any role you want to be, use any weapon and armor combination you want to use, but a Dragon Knight can never learn the Sorcerer skills.  It is the one aspect of ESO that to me still feels out of place.  What if I want to gain the Sorcerer abilities even though I am a Dragon Knight?  The original Elder Scrolls never put any kind of restriction on your ability to use or learn skills and it is the one aspect of ESO I would love to see changed.\n\nZenimax Online Studios (ZOS) is new to MMOs, they have definitely made mistakes.  But they have also been adequate at improving the experience of ESO in attempting to bridge that gap between the elements that make the Elderscrolls and the elements that make a great MMO.  It's not all there yet but If they continue down this road I can foresee an MMO unlike any other set in one of the most beloved settings of any game that will making it worthy of being called an Elder Scrolls game and I believe that is what all of us who are fans of the series wants to see.","April 28, 2015","true","835.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's less complex than WoW's high-level combat because there are just 6 ability slots you can use instead of dozens.\nthis isn't nescessarily a bad thing though, it makes it easier to learn your attacks and takes less space on your screen which adds to immersion.\n\nI haven't played very long yet so I can't say much about the PVP or PVE side of the game.\nBut I've heard wow's endgame PVE is better.\nOne thing I dislike about ESO this far is the fact that you'll have to save for quite a few days to get a mount if you are not willing to buy one with real money, and also the lack of flying mounts ingame.\n\nIf you like wow, but wish it was a bit more immersive, simple, visually appealing or simply subscription free,\nand/or if you are a fan of the elder scrolls' lore, this is your game.\nWoW certainly has things that are better than in ESO right now, like some anim./emotes, diversity in armor, garrisons & raids..\n(Do keep in mind that ESO is rather new compared to WoW, so i think it's kinda forgivable.)\n\nI suggest you try both if you haven't already.\nBoth are good, But hey, I prefer to keep my €13 each month.\n","April 1, 2015","true","39.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's less complex than WoW's high-level combat because there are just 6 ability slots you can use instead of dozens.\nthis isn't nescessarily a bad thing though, it makes it easier to learn your attacks and takes less space on your screen which adds to immersion.\n\nI haven't played very long yet so I can't say much about the PVP or PVE side of the game.\nBut I've heard wow's endgame PVE is better.\nOne thing I dislike about ESO this far is the fact that you'll have to save for quite a few days to get a mount if you are not willing to buy one with real money, and also the lack of flying mounts ingame.\n\nIf you like wow, but wish it was a bit more immersive, simple, visually appealing or simply subscription free,\nand/or if you are a fan of the elder scrolls' lore, this is your game.\nWoW certainly has things that are better than in ESO right now, like some anim./emotes, diversity in armor, garrisons & raids..\n(Do keep in mind that ESO is rather new compared to WoW, so i think it's kinda forgivable.)\n\nI suggest you try both if you haven't already.\nBoth are good, But hey, I prefer to keep my €13 each month.\n","April 1, 2015","true","39.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The only deference is that enstead of a blacksmith you haad to forge the items your self. I wished they would have used skyrims crafting system it felt more realistic.i mean i understand that if they would have used skyrim's it would have made the game too dependent on farming like in Dragon Age Inquesition. but still they could have done more with the crafting system is all like at least making things for heavey armor a little easier.Combat feels a little cheap too. Every other Elder Scrolls' combat system feels way more real then in this one. But unlike other Elder Scrolls i do like the level up feature. Leveling up on the fly and geting a new ability comes in handy from time time.Even though it is the same as Skyrim.I just Wish there were more classes to chose from is one of  my only  grivence with this game. But i guess the fact that the Skills you can get as your character levels up can be morphed is a great way to make up for the limited class selection. another thing is how limited the world is i mean this is the first time you are able to actually explore Tamriel,but key places aren't fully open yet such as Vvardenfal which is a key reason i bought the game well that and A few other places like Elswyre and the Black Marsh and Summerset Isle and other places not really visted in past Elder Scrolls. But a great add on to the game is the faction wars! When you actually win a PvP battle Agenst two or more other players it makes you feel accomplished and pretty bsadd @$$. So in closing i recomend this game faults and all the story is the best part of any game especally with the Elder Scrolls.I won't give those who havent played yet any spoilers you will need to play to get the story and form your own opinon on it.  But i give this game an 8/10 for great story PvP Wars and a pretty large map","April 15, 2015","true","41.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","4"

I kept telling my friend that this was Elder Scrolls online, NOT Skyrim! She didn't think about that and became a bit dissappointed. So don't expect it to be something it's not. But even though it's not Skyrim, this game is really good. There are lots of quests to be completed, and very much land to explore. The scenery is beautiful. There are also way more customization options now for characters, which is awesome. I only wish there were more players to talk to, it's kind of lonely. But overall it's a good game and I think you should buy it. Wait until sale though, because it's pretty expensive, and the DLC is not worth it.","September 22, 2015","true","245.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What more could you wish for?\n\nBut seriously. It's NOT a WoW clone like some would suggest. If you've played games like Rift and The Secret World, that's more in line of how the MMO aspect of it is. It's an action MMO. You don't just sit there and spam number keys until you win. Constant moving and rolling are absolute musts in serious combat. The blocking mechanic is much more important than it may appear to be as well. And no, there's no headshots, it's still an MMO.\n\nThe first person view animations are extremely detailed. Every once and a while, I enjoy casting spells from an FPS perspective. Of course, 3rd person is king in an MMO, but that doesn't take away the fact that first person was very well exectuted and an occasional treat when I'm up for it.\n\nCrafting is well done. Combat and leveling are well done. The Crown Store is extremely fair with no pay walls. You can literally buy the game and never invest a penny into it...unless you want the DLC of course. But I dare you to not buy a cool looking mount or pet at one point or another =)\n\nTons of content regarding the beloved Elder Scrolls lore. Don't let this fool you if you're new to MMO's but familiar with Skyrim or Oblivion. It may be an action MMO, but don't expect the type of combat and controls you get in either of those games. It's an MMO afterall, but wilh great animations, sick looking spells, heavy emphasis on positioning/blocking during major fights and an aesthetically pleasing UI.\n\nThe graphics may not compare to single player games, but man, for an MMO I'm in love with it's aesthetics and general look. The Elder Scrolls art direction is in FULL effect here. (One of the dungeons will even make you think back to the beginning sewers in Oblivion)\n\nThe sound design is top quality. And that music. The title screen music alone totally rocks!\n\nAs always, it's best to play with friends or family to have a blast. Your crafting will compliment each other as well. Although, you shouldn't have too much trouble soloing if that's your thing. Finding groups for dungeons is quick and easy and TBH, the game just isn't very hard. Ever. You'll out level an area way before you finish all the quests, especially if you're running dungeons in between. It's the only gripe I have with TESO. The game is just too easy. I haven't tried out PVP yet, but from what I hear from people close to me, it's pretty damn good.\n\nIt's my favorite MMO to date. Highly recommended.\n\nTDLR:\n\nIf you like action MMO (like The Secret World) and the Elder Scrolls lore, this one's a no brainer. Get it.","October 21, 2015","true","260.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I play EVE: Online and I tried the World Of Warcraft trial but that's as much expirence I have with these kind of games.\n\nTHIS GAME IS AWESOME.\n\nI really love this game and I've played it for about 2 weeks straight. The first thing you should know before playing/buying this game is that it is NOT Skyrim. The universe is the same and you can be the same classes as in Skyrim but it is VERY different.\n\nPros:\n~Good graphics considering it's a MMORPG.\n~Fun story and lore which makes me want to play more Elder Scrolls games.\n~Awesome bosses.\n~Easy to learn\n~WAY BETTER THAN WORLD OF WARCRAFT. (I think WOW is a peice of ♥♥♥♥)\n~Grouping with friends is very easy.\n~Most of the side quests are fun and have a interesting backstory.\n~Game feels very rewarding when you kill a boss or complete a hard quest.\n~Good Voice acting.\n~Fun co-op and PvP with large groups of players.\n~Getting Vampire/Werewolf bite is a fun challenge.\n~Online community is never toxic/offensive and getting help in chat is really easy and all players help out noobies.\n~Theft/Justice system is funny.\n\nCons:\n~Get's buggy every once in a while. (Character voice overs and reactions are sometimes delayed.\n~Not as good as other Elder Scrolls games. (Just not as polished or as well done as Skyrim or Oblivion)\n~PvP is pretty unbalanced when your not with a large group protecting/helping you.\n~Playing and completing quest above your skill level will give you LESS expirence. (This was recently added I believe)\n~Bosses are mostly the same size except for humaniod NPCs. (This is understandable since it IS and MMORPG and they can't render a large boss easily)\n~Making alternate characters and leveling them is SUPER boring.\n\nConclusion:\n\nElder Scrolls Online is a great game for gamers wanting to get into the MMORPG/Online gaming world. The community is super friendly which is always helpful when learning a new game. I personally don't like open world games because they split up the story and distract the player with sidequests because they can't think up of a long enough story. (This is why I don't like Assassin's Creed.) TESO keeps you interested 100% of the time and there is always something to do. (I legit spent almost 4 hours of gameplay stealing enough armour so I could customized my character. The only game that does the community and large scale PvP (AT THE SAME TIME) is EVE: Online. If your not going to get this game get EVE.\n\n9/10 Would play forever.\n\nIf you end up getting this game and want to learn how to play, join the guild The Brothers Of Bacon. I can teach you some tricks to get good fast.\n\n","July 10, 2015","true","94.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I play EVE: Online and I tried the World Of Warcraft trial but that's as much expirence I have with these kind of games.\n\nTHIS GAME IS AWESOME.\n\nI really love this game and I've played it for about 2 weeks straight. The first thing you should know before playing/buying this game is that it is NOT Skyrim. The universe is the same and you can be the same classes as in Skyrim but it is VERY different.\n\nPros:\n~Good graphics considering it's a MMORPG.\n~Fun story and lore which makes me want to play more Elder Scrolls games.\n~Awesome bosses.\n~Easy to learn\n~WAY BETTER THAN WORLD OF WARCRAFT. (I think WOW is a peice of ♥♥♥♥)\n~Grouping with friends is very easy.\n~Most of the side quests are fun and have a interesting backstory.\n~Game feels very rewarding when you kill a boss or complete a hard quest.\n~Good Voice acting.\n~Fun co-op and PvP with large groups of players.\n~Getting Vampire/Werewolf bite is a fun challenge.\n~Online community is never toxic/offensive and getting help in chat is really easy and all players help out noobies.\n~Theft/Justice system is funny.\n\nCons:\n~Get's buggy every once in a while. (Character voice overs and reactions are sometimes delayed.\n~Not as good as other Elder Scrolls games. (Just not as polished or as well done as Skyrim or Oblivion)\n~PvP is pretty unbalanced when your not with a large group protecting/helping you.\n~Playing and completing quest above your skill level will give you LESS expirence. (This was recently added I believe)\n~Bosses are mostly the same size except for humaniod NPCs. (This is understandable since it IS and MMORPG and they can't render a large boss easily)\n~Making alternate characters and leveling them is SUPER boring.\n\nConclusion:\n\nElder Scrolls Online is a great game for gamers wanting to get into the MMORPG/Online gaming world. The community is super friendly which is always helpful when learning a new game. I personally don't like open world games because they split up the story and distract the player with sidequests because they can't think up of a long enough story. (This is why I don't like Assassin's Creed.) TESO keeps you interested 100% of the time and there is always something to do. (I legit spent almost 4 hours of gameplay stealing enough armour so I could customized my character. The only game that does the community and large scale PvP (AT THE SAME TIME) is EVE: Online. If your not going to get this game get EVE.\n\n9/10 Would play forever.\n\nIf you end up getting this game and want to learn how to play, join the guild The Brothers Of Bacon. I can teach you some tricks to get good fast.\n\n","July 10, 2015","true","94.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The only close competitor is The Secret World, which has better character customization (no classes, any character can learn everything), and better story, but less content overall and is a grind. There's more to do in ESO, and more to come, and the rest is pretty good.\n\nESO is currently my main game. I played in beta, I own 10 accounts, I have a VR16 (max level) and 7 VR level characters in total. I am max in every tradeskill. So don't let the hours listed on steam fool you. I usually start the client from desktop.\n\nPros\n-Any class can play any role (although there is still imbalance among classes; it would be better if the devs made all abilities accessable to every character, and had classes just be a starting point that don't prevent you from learning something, or building your own class/template, as the single player games do, and as the Secret World does)\n-Huge world to explore; and it is growing\n-New content and PvP are both open to low-level (who get scaled up) and high-level players at the same time\n-All dungeons scale up\n-Interesting stories; not all of them are interesting, but there are a ton of quests and some really good writing\n-Dungeon pledges (Undaunted guild is awesome in general)\n-You can steal things from the environment and NPCs as you can in the single-player games; thieves guild will be added in the next DLC, and dark brotherhood will be added after that\n-Your decisions impact the story at least in small ways; a character who lives or dies through your choices will show up later, or not, etc.\n-Maelstrom Arena (solo) and Dragonstar Arena (group) are fantastic, challenging, repeatable content\n-Combat and interface are pretty damn good and engaging for an MMO, timing and player skill matter\n-The Champion System enables horizontal progression beyond the leveling system; although they are planning to gate gear based on accumulated champion points, which the community, in general, opposes\n-They will be removing veteran ranks going forward so that players will reach a level cap and not have to worry about it increasing thereafter\n-They will be implementing spellcrafting going forward (potentially allowing any character to learn any ability other than passives)\n-They will have a justice system going forward where players can bounty-hunt other players\n-The crafting system is incredibly deep\n-It's fun\n-The dye system is pretty cool, as are motifs and custom sets\n-Controller support is in now!\n\nCons\n-Classes that prevent players from learning the abilities of other classes; this was not the case in previous Elder Scrolls games; there were classes in those games, but whatever class you started with, you could still eventually learn everything; some people think classes are needed for an MMO, however, TSW has shown this isn't the case, and you do not end up with a single cookie-cutter build dominationg, although there are flavor of the month builds that people create builds to beat the next month, you end up with more diversity with more options, not less\n-Still lots of "kill 10 of X and bring me their heads" kind of quests (the Witcher 3 has shown how questing, even side quests, should work, all MMOs could learn from it)\n-The damn guild auction system; I understand the reasons for it, and that it provides a disincentive to macroers and gold farmers, but it still frustrates the hell out of me\n-Imbalance between classes and races, even at end-game\n-Respecing is an enormous gold and time sink; TSW lets you learn all abilities and choose which ones you'll use whenever you're not in combat, for free, and you can store builds and switch gear and ability choices instantly with a push of a button based on the content you are facing; that is a much better, and deeper, system; dungeons and raids in ESO are pretty good, but TSW is better from this perspective, just not enough of them\n-No ability to change character look (particularly voice and race) after creation, although this is being worked on\n-You can only train your mount one point per day; bloody headache\n-The devs keep nerfing grinds, it sucks that you need to have at least one of every class to learn every ability, so you're forced to make alts (I would prefer one character that I can learn every ability on, but have to pick and choose what I use); making you repeat the same content over and over on each alt sucks\n-Achievements are not account-wide, but at least champion points are\n\nThere's are many great things about ESO, so many good stories, lots of big and small dungeons, and so much to do that it can be overwhelming at times. It's a great game and worth investing your time and money in as it looks like things will get better over time, even if ZOS stumbles now and then.","December 1, 2015","true","31.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

ESO, however, encompasses all 10 countries of Tamriel. So, needless to say, prepare to spend a LOT of time with this game.\n\nThat being said, I still really love this game.\n\nAs a big Elder Scrolls fan, it makes me absolutely giddy that you can go almost anywhere in Tamriel, and Zenimax/Bethesda did really well to diversify the different cultures. It is so amazing to finally see the lush foliage of Valenwood, the warm sands of Hammerfell, and the moon sugar farms of Elsweyr.\nIt doesn't exactly have the most detailed graphics in the world, but that's mostly because it's online. However, I still think the game is super pretty, and I can't help but oggle at it occasionally. (My screenshot folder is filled to the brim)\n\nI do, however, have a warning to new players. If you don't level up properly, battles against enemies will be very difficult. It's not like non-online games, where you can adjust the difficulty to your liking.\nAlso, the sneaking system in this game is quite different to other Bethesda games...\nThere's no way to level up or get better at sneaking. That, and as soon as you do a sneak attack, you immediately stop crouching. This is the first time since Morrowind that I didn't play an assassin character.\n\nOverall, though, I am curently really enjoying this game, and I recommend it to any huge Elder Scrolls fan who is willing to put in a lot of time to learn the lore and explore Tamriel.\n","December 29, 2015","true","421.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Need more be said, really? Beautiful world, beautiful mmorpg. Spent many of hours in this game, and boy, does it leave a satisfied feeling. Now, you'll see a lot of people complain about glitchiness (mostly from the early days) or maybe price (but they dropped the membership fee) I mean, there are a few mechanics missing still, but i'm hoping to see implimented eventually, like duels, and battlegrounds.

Personally I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ they are talking about. I have only EVER had one crash in this game, and it was because i installed a faulty mod (so it was not even the games fault). Also i have an i5 running windows 10... and if i can run it flawlessly, you sure as hell can too.\n\nIn summary; this is a very good game that is worth your money and your time, and a good 99% of the people complaining that this game is not working for them are either trying to run this on a potato or have done something to ♥♥♥♥ up the game (possibly without even knowing it). I would definitely recommend this game to everyone who like MMOs or the Elder Scrolls games. Now here is my old review.\n\nPre Edit:\n\nI love this game.\n\nIn the few hours I have played so far (as I am writing this review) i have:\nLost my soul\nEscape hell\nSeek revenge\nSave my giant friend\nBecome a werewolf\nGet a group of 20 people to absolutely ♥♥♥♥ over a dungeon\nGet in a player made strip club\nGet kicked out of a player made strip club\nStart a mob\nGet in an argument with a vampire\nWin an argument\nPunched a tiger so hard it dies\nKilled a family of trolls\nRode around on the back of a leopard\nBought a pet dog\nAnd lastly I ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off god!\n\nThis game does not have as many bugs at people would like you to think, in fact its quite well made and well put together. The MMO aspect of this game is very smooth and runs well most of the time (some times there are servers issues but its understandable). I Bought this game on sale for 20 ish bucks and it was worth way more then every penny. Hell is it worth more than 70$ (but if it was over 70$ it would start becoming money hungry). But I am rambling, to sum it up its a good game with lots of fun, lots of lore, and lots of people to share said experience.\n\nPS: Try not to join dagger fall, it is the most underpopulated area in the game.","January 3","true","152.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

As far as I can tell ZeniMax and Bethesda have fixed 90% of the original bugs and in many ways improved the all round enjoyment of the game.\n\nIf you are looking for a way to compare TESO:TU to another game, from my experience I would describe it as a mixture of World of Warcraft and Skyrim, obviously with it's own unique twist.. but that's the most accurate comparison I can provide.\n\nTo keep the review short, I'll end saying that The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited is without doubt worth it's price, at least for someone such as myself. If you aren't 100% sure this is the right game for you, even are a little 'research' I'd suggest waiting for a sale or search for one privately to acquire it cheaper.","December 27, 2015","true","21.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Graphics are very similar to Skyrim if put on high, which is pretty damn good for an MMO. Quests aren't full of grind, you feel more involved in each quest given compared to other MMO's.\n\nHaven't tried pvp yet, I heard it's crap because people come together in 40 man groups and gank everyone and it causes massive lag. That sounds pretty boring. Haven't tried it though, we'll see.\nEdit: PvP is fun, the huge battles are a bit hectic but I mostly find myself in situations of 1v2 or 2v3 because I like to do the dungeon/cave grinding in the pvp areas.\nEdit2: PvP is ridiculously laggy, players are always complaining of 700-900+ ping and it is simply unplayable.\n\nCrafting is pretty simple, and I can find materials anywhere to sell if I don't like to craft.\nPeople randomly offer to craft ♥♥♥♥ for me even if I don't know them, it seems like everyone  wants to be a mastercraftsman or something.\n\nMonthly payment not required, I don't feel limited at all for playing the game. The only thing I've noticed is I have a limited amount of characters I can delete.\n\nIf I try to switch from NA / EU it's like a whole different game, with each patch I must download it two times, and if it's your first time switching you must download the entire game again.

It keeps you in character, you really don't feel you are leveling up, but instead feel you are saving the world.\nIt's really the first time I found a MMO can be so attractive.\nIt's both fun for solo-play, as well as play with friends.\nAs long as you are an RPG lover, this is the game for you.","April 6","true","146.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I still think that Skyrim is better, mainly because I play my games in a certain way. However, ESO has gone extremely far and developed in leaps and bounds since it first was released. I haven't racked up a lot of hours thus far, but I'm enjoying the experience a lot.\n\nThe only negative...well, not completely negative, I just don't like it, is the combat/weapon system. In Skyrim and Oblivian, when I used my bow, it felt like I was using a bow. In ESO, It just doesn't have the same feel. Now maybe its just because I'm a low level at this point, however, a bow is a long range weapon...why does it feel so short range in game?!!! I'm a stealth/assassin based character who's go to weapon is the bow. I feel like I'm using a bloody dagger at some points, there is litterally nothing long-range about my weapon in ESO. Hopefully things will improve when I reach higher levels, but at this point, that is my only complaint.\n\nOther than that, this is a really awesome game. And even if you don't enjoy pvp (which I don't), this game doesn't force you into playing a certain way. There are multiple ways of playing, and if you're like me and enjoy just solo adventuring/questing, you can do that. Tamriel is litterally unlimited and what a wonderful world it is. Now, if only we could play ESO and Skyrim in vertual reality...then my life would be complete!!!!","May 2","true","56.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is as good an RPG as any geek could dream for. Zenimax has realised that Skyrim was too small, and have expanded the Elder Scrolls Universe to include almost every area Lore has refered to.\n\nYour range of classes and races, and the multitude of mix n match options to get what you want, is just wonderful. Stealthy thief that kills at range but can disappear instantly when attacked up close? Tick. Combat Medic who can stand in the middle of the fray and absorb damage like a tank? Tick. Standard mad melee DPS hair streaming wildly swinging a broadsword gashing wild random death amongst her enemies? Tick.\n\nI started this game with trepidation, as the first area is horribly bland and dull in colour, but that is part of the storyline. The second you move to the following areas, things get more "Skyrimmy". The attention to detail, and the tiny little hidden and special things are tremendously abundant. So much so, that you don't notice initially the copy paste standard dungeon layout we have seen throughout the series. There are a number of unique dungeon layouts, but about 6 are re-used, and honestly, you have to be on the lookout to notice this. They have REALLY taken the time to decorate and give a unique feal to every area.\n\nI spend a large amount of my time wandering around just looking at things. My child tells me to go outside as there are real life things to see outside the house, and well, this is better. Deep in the darkness of an eerie mine, sneaying behind some disheveld mishappen creatures green slimy ooze dribbling out of its mouth, i stumble across a skeleton hidden in a corner away from the evil, a hastily scribbled note to his loved one lies next to him bemoaning his state and "why did I ever leave you my love, the reaches promised down here could never compare to the treause in your heart". *flutter*\n\nLittle conversations amongst random NPCs all over the show adds to the atmosphere and interacting with non quest NPCs is possible, either for a little detail, or comic relief. The talking Skeleton in the Thieves Refuge in Stonefalls is one of my favourites. Humour is superb and prolific throughout this game, much of it just silly silliness and the rest some good solidly laid out humour, most of the side quests are funny in one way or another, wheres the main questline retains a rather serious undertone, some good balancing there.\n\nVoice actors such as John Cleese and that wonderful human from Underworld Bill Nighy along with Kate Beckinsale as well as Michael Gambon and Peter Stormare are just a portion of the MARVELOUS talent and a hint at the storyline you are about to experience. This is all just mesmerising and truly immersive.\n\nI stumbled across a petrified completely naked and rather hungover Nord in Deshaan, musclebound as he was, he was in dread fear of his wife and "the witches who stole my clothes! (hic)", further conversation with the wife reveals this is a common occourence, and when i went to fetch his axe, a family heirloom, things got a bit crazy, for there indeed was a witch! Why his clothes disappeared is anybodies guess, but the tongue lashing he was recieving as I rode away on my Horse with the gold his wife had given me was quite inspiring to never get thot frunk. Again...\n\nI yearned for Cyrodiil though! And initially i went as far as galloping across two maps to enter The Rift and visit Riften, one of my favourite areas in Skyrim and of course where i was hoping the thieves guild would be! Upon arrival the instant death my level 8 toon recieved was a bit shocking, turns out areas are designed to feed you along per level, and the rift is about 2/3rds in! So what now! Well, upon hitting level 10, I was invited to join in a bloody campaign. TO WAR! And Cyrodiil!\n\nBasically, with the 900+ hours I have under the belt, I havent finished more that 1/5th of the main questline, as upon entering Cyrodiil, the PvP section and Alliance War area, I discovered it impossible to leave....\n\nThis battle arena is the entirety of the old TESO IV :Oblivion map. One huge battlezone. Each of the three factions has a section of the map that contains their Home Keeps, and two Elder Scrolls. You spend your days protecting your own, setting up ambushes for incoming maruaders or going deep behind enemy lines to steal resources or gank unsuspecting stragglers.\n\nThe intensity of your Squad of 24 slowly and surely getting into position to Siege an unsuspecting Keep, the sudden call for SIEGES UP!!! Trebuchettes rising out of the ground to begin hurling immense flaming balls of rock at the enemies defenses, hurtling overhead these messages of doom explode upon the enemy sundering man, stone and beast alike. They do not take this lightly! INCOMING!!! Oil and rotten meat is getting hurled over the walls at our troops! But its not too late! A breach! 4 of my brethren can take it no longer, the battle lust fills them and they revert into their natural werewolf form! The attack resumes as the enemy try to push us back, we storm through the breach into the inner courtyard, the call is for a battering Ram on the main gate, fiery burning oil is splatteting all around us but our Combat Medics are prepared, purging us of this new death they stand steadfast in the middle of the fray.\n\nThe gate trembles, we are nearly in! A shout from our flanks! DEF DEF DEF! All turn but too late, their re-inforcements who we thought were engaged in battle on the other side of the map have heard their comrades calls for assistance, riding hard they arrive to trample our assault, lying broken and dead, only one of our number has managed to escape, he has stealthily hidden himself behind our corpses, hoping to resurect us when things quieten down, but for now, I suffer the indignity as one of the enemy uses the /pushups emote to playfully copulate with my corpse. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I'm totally comign back to get him.\n\nBuy this game.","March 1","true","689.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(Expensive, very decorated cakes.... DLC and upgrades are needed if you get obsessed).\nYou have to purchase crafting styles, and the large cities like The Imperial City.\nThieves Guild also costs $, despite the other guilds being free. (So far.... worth it though).\nVery taxing... I meet the minimum specs and still have to have excellent internet connection to not constantly lag.\n\nWindows 10 users... Hubs and I bought this at the same time. He has 10, I have 7. My game downloaded (expect a day of downloading patches after purchase) and I was able to play. Hubs downloaded, and we had to work for several hours trying to figure out why he was getting login errors. (Saying his copied steam code was wrong, login was wrong when it wasnt... etc). ESO.com will tell you that they cant help if steam gives you a bad code, and good luck getting steam to help either.\nPoint being, it seems as though Windows 10 has compatability issues (though we did get it to work after trying every god forsaken thing we could think of.... no idea which one did the trick).\n\nOh, and if you play for more than 2 hours Steam will not refund you, but we racked up 4 hours of game play just trying to get it to work so.\n\nWell this has kind of turned into a negative reveiw but I dont mean it to be! Gameplay, graphics, charas & storylines are all superb. Absolutely love this game.... plan on wasting many weeks away on it.\n8/10","March 14","true","45.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"
