This isn't AA title but hey, there is hard to find similar game to this one and I assure you that running is really enjoyable. There are 3 types of levels: free run where you grab the power cells, drag where the timing is important and speed where you run with high speed and avoid obstacles. Visual aesthetics with changing theme of colors and electronic soundtrack really fits in.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aFlemingoZ/recommended/280910/","aFlemingoZ","Flemingo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aFlemingoZ/","197 products in account","After playing a bit of this game now I feel I can write an honest review on it, so here goes.\n\nT.E.C 3001 is a runner, where you control a robot through various courses in different game modes. The campaign consists of 3 game modes, a freerun mode, a speed run mode and a drag race mode. On top of these campaign gamemodes there is a seperate mode to play which is the unlimited runner mode.\n\nIn freerun mode, you get full control of your character to jump between the various levels and layers of the pre-generated worlds. You can use all the controlls, boost, slide, jump and double jump to traverse the areas, being faced with obstacles like barriers and walls you can slide under, and speed boost power ups. Freerun requires you to take full advantage of these abilites, by facing you with walls that require precision timing for you to dodge past. This is where the game really shines, as you are not on set tracks and are free to jump away from the path entirely, only to come back in having looped around a tough obstacle. Throughout these stages there are checkpoints, so if you muck up right near the finish line you won't have to start from the very beginning which is a very forgiving bonus. These levels don't require you to take a set path, you can alternate between the many layers of the track at will which gives every replay a unique feeling and keeps the track fresh, for a time anyway.\n\nSpeed Run mode is a more traditional runner mode, reminiscent of games like Temple Run. You are stuck to one course where you must simply dodge the obstacles that are presented. You use the arrow keys to switch between the three lanes, having no option to jump out of the track like you can in Freerun. The tracks are usually straight forward and require you to pick up the collectables to finish.\n\nDrag Race mode requires you to time your boosts, bound to the up arrow, to speed up and finish the course before the time is up. The obstacles in this mode are straight forward, and unlike the other two modes there is no way to switch between lanes. You are bound to the middle lane and must time your boosts with the icons on the track to get enough speed in time.\n\nUnlimited Runner is more of a side mode, you won't be spending as much time on it as the campaign unless you like the feel of an endless track runner. It is a randomly generated track, built on the Speed Run mechanics, so there's not much to say about it.\n\nNow these are my opinions on the gamemodes. Freerun, as I already stated, is certainly the strong point of the game. It is interesting and tries its best to stay that way, and will be the mode you look forward to while playing the campaign. Speed Run is fun, but gets old quickly. It is more enjoyable to play in the form of Unlimited Runner in my opinion because this really extends the longevity of it and allows for high score beating and the like. Drag Race feels like it was thrown in as a filler, because I honestly don't have much fun with it at all. It's repetive, and feels like a grind to complete, and not a unique experience. It gets boring quick and you probably won't look forward to playing it, or not as much as other modes.\n\nFor the price, T.E.C 3001 is an amazing game. It offers quite a bit of gameplay while staying fresh and interesting besides a few letdowns. It has simplistic yet beautiful visuals and a nice soundtrack, and is a great experience. If I were to change anything about it, it would be to remove the Drag Race game mode and try to add even more variety to Freerun (Tracks that curve upwards, requiring you to run on the roof?) and possibly some more variety to Speed Run to make it feel less repetitive. Other than these slight hinderances, it's almost a garaunteed buy for me and a rating of 8/10.","April 13, 2014","true","5.3"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","0"

Let’s call him Tom for short, Tom is designed to move forward without stopping. T.E.C. 3001 is a runner in third or first person where you need to make it from the start to the finish of each course. It sounds simple and it might even sound mundane, but T.E.C. manages to mix things up with a lot of abilities and types of tracks that keep every moment engaging.\n\nThe game has a beautiful color scheme and its humble in terms of graphics, but it gets the job done admirably. For the most part, each area consists of a single color’s hue. You’ll see tones of red and when you pass through a gate, then the tone will meld into blue, then yellow and so on.  Even a simple color change makes the game look fresh. There are still environments for all of these courses that make them look different even if its just the same objects. You’ll see mountains in the distance, a futuristic grid from the 1980s, and walls. So many walls.\n\nLike most runners, T.E.C. is a one more try sort of game. Slamming into a wall will send you back to the last checkpoint, but there’s so little downtime that it keeps you in the action for just one more time again and again. In this case, Tom is running for batteries in a race against time. You only have X number of seconds to make it to the goal and you need to collect Y number of batteries along the way.\n\nAs you speed along, the game will pinpoint and highlight the batteries for a brief moment before you’re near them. That way you can prepare for them. Depending on how many you get, there are three ranks for each course and all courses can be replayed to your heart’s content for better times.\n\nTruth be told, the runner genre is one of my least favorite that I can still tolerate to play. I see the genre as a one trick pony while T.E.C. 3001 is a mustang that turns every course into a magic show. There is a lot of diversity here. For starters, because the camera chases after the metal man so you have control to turn him left and right. Its the full motion that makes this game more engaging and challenging than a typical runner.\n\nWith Tom’s speed he turns slow, which is okay given the genre. Almost every course opens up into branches that allow for some nonlinear play. Take one path on this run, take another on that run. The game shines when there are multiple paths for you to jump between both up and down below.\n\nTom has several standard abilities, such as a sliding kick that will get you under limbo walls. There is a standard jump, but also a double jump. You can even dash to break through glass and dash in mid air to make it across extra long gaps. The course has a variety of arrows, green arrows make you move faster, red arrows slow you down. Some levels have timing arrows that consist of red, yellow and red. Hit a speed boost on a specific arrow to determine if you’ll go faster or slower. Think of it as Guitar Hero with one button and one chord.\n\nHitting the red arrows lets you move slow enough where you can jump off a course’s path and then double jump back onto the same path. There are high jump pads that send you into the air and even sky diving rings that you dash through to leap off and then dash through the landing rings or slam into the ground. In flight you can move around to dodge things. Its all an impressive array of tricks. Just when you think the game is out of tricks, another one is conjured up for you, such as what I can only describe as a freeway on ramp. Tom turns slow, so these are generous wide turns on narrow platforms.\n\nThere is some thought, logic and strategy to these tricks, such as falling down a far distance and still landing on the course will tumble Tom into a vulnerable state where for a brief moment, Tom cannot jump, dive or anything like that. Dashing leaves you with the same vulnerability. If you dash and fail to achieve what you meant to, its another split second before you can use it again. Its all timing and its easy enough, but the game begins to wildly throw obstacles at you after you’re in the tenth course.\n\nTo mix up the gameplay, there are some courses where the full ability to run where you please is taken away and it turns into running on three rails to which you just left and right between them. These tend to be faster paced levels. You’ll find an endless mode that makes use of this three lane mechanic as the game throws walls, vaults and limbos at you.\n\nMy only real problem with the game is that it takes away the instructions. In an age where people complain about hand holding, I felt like there were times when I needed it. Such as the double jump into a dash mid air. After one failure, the instruction never appeared again without restarting the entire level. That instruction might also throw people off, but when you see it once, that’s it.\n\nFor anyone with friends, there is two player split screen where you compete against one another on the same track. I had to compete against a controller on a pillow and after one slip up, it managed to take the lead. A failure on your part sends you back a bit.\n\nAt $4, that’s the right price for the game, its enough to be a diversion and one of the best in its shallow genre. Its worth taking a risk if you’re even remotely interested in it.","September 13, 2015","true","2.3"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","20","20","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/280910/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The infinite runner is one of those genres like the cover-based shooter and the instrument-focused music game that really blossomed in the last few years.There’s plenty of infinite runners that show both innovation and fun design for gamers looking for a bit more challenge and the recent Steam re-release of T.E.C. 3001 stands as a prime example. T.E.C. 3001 puts you in the shoes of some robot, dashing along virtual-reality cityscapes in an attempt to collect batteries. Developers Phoenix Games claims you’re collecting “virtual space energy leftovers for humanity”, which all sounds fun and ’90s sci-fi enough.The sense of speed is great, and the feeling of momentum as you slide under obstacles or bank around corners is impressive. The game boasts a foot tapping and rather infectious electronic soundtrack that suits the pace of the action. The gameplay is nicely broken up and varied by the addition of differing styles of courses; drag race stages give you no control over direction and instead focus on speed changes and obstacle dodging, while the ‘lane swap’ levels often move at an impressive breakneck speed throughout and only offer you the ability to move between three lanes of movement. This variety was a welcome break from the game’s usual gameplay. Control mappings are rather unintuitive at first, with the different between ‘charge’ and ‘speed up’ escaping me during the tutorial due to no explanation. While TEC 3001 is nothing to necessarily write home about, it is a competent and relatively fun distraction. With 41 courses and some local splitscreen race modes, it provides several hours of content for a low price of admission. Essentially, the game offers a good budget alternative to other popular ‘runner’ style games on Steam at the moment.","October 3, 2014","true","11.9"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"

T.E.C is a 3D linear running game.\n\nThis game feels like it was greatly paid attention to, from the gameplay to the visual details and music. There are three basic modes to T.E.C. The first requires you to run in a straight line and commit to certain dodge techniques. The second sort of works like a grid system, where acceleration and top speed rise sharply and quick manouevers are needed. The third mode consists of free running, where the player is in full control of every tilt their player makes. This last game mode is what makes this game unique. There are levels where I've felt I've barely made the turn but still managed to make it to the end. The free running is extremely fun as you'll quickly be jumping platform to platform (which go in all directions).\n\nOne thing I've noticed in free running is some courses require the player to make 360 degree turns running up a platform. As the joystick is held in one direction, the player finally starts leaning inwards making a sharper turn, while the camera begins to rotate over the shoulder. This is a cool concept, and makes for a great visual, but can make it hard to control the runner accurately. I also have no idea how to reset the camera back to normal when that happens. On top of creative level design and good control schemes, the game offers local co-op on top of multiplayer. Third and first person views are also a feature in the game.\n\nThe visuals are appealing, and game (and menu) colors change with each color-icon you hit. Graphics are sharp but there seems to be more room for improvement here. The backgrounds are quite plain. Level designs are immaculate as there is no one way to go about your business, which makes it welcoming to local co-op. Sounds are few but on point. I like when the runner jumps from a height and that smashing metal sound plays. Music seems to be original and some tracks are quite catchy.\n\nFor future T.E.C games, perhaps make a "fight" mode for local co-op where players can run into one another, or perhaps strike each other as a distraction. Also, maybe having an options to designate sensitivity of the joystick would be appreciated, unless the dev's wanted this certain feel.\n\n\nRATING : 7.35/10\n\n\nGameplay	B+	Story / Campaign	B-	Visuals / User Interface	B	Sounds / Music	B-	Replay-ability	B-	Overall 	B-\n\nScreenShots :\nThe free form control I was speaking of as well as multiple choices for routes\n\nYou can slide in third person or first person\n\nProof of the third or first person view options\n\nAny game that has double jump, I am a huge fan of","June 18, 2015","true","2.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","9","9","2","0"

If you're interested in the feel of speedrunning without spending hours plotting your own route or learning the minute specifics of a game engine, definitely check this out.\n\nCheck the screenshots/video on the store page to see what the game's going to look like; if you like that visual style, you won't be disappointed. The visual feel is very "'80s cyberspace"...the same kind of vibe as Lawnmower Man, but updated for modern graphics hardware. :) The audio is OK as well; I can only say "OK" because the game is so demanding of your attention that honestly I never had time to actually listen to the music. I did sample them from the pause screen, though, so I did notice they were pretty good.\n\nWhen I first started playing, the game seemed overly hard due to the (lack of) responsiveness of the character. To put it another way...you corner like a boat. A large boat...like a cruise ship. It's really frustrating in the beginning, because it feels unfair considering the speed that obstacles are coming at you. Hang in there, though; it does get easier. Well, I mean, it never gets any easier but you get better at it. You'll learn that the secret is to anticipate what's coming, and already be ready to get into position. Technically that is a minus in my book, since I don't like when a game requires you to have already played the level to beat it. Having said that, the game is fun enough that it's still worth it.  It occurs to me, after further thought, that perhaps a counter-argument to this would be that if the character were that responsive, you'd constantly be flying off the map due to over-sensitivity.\n\nGetting all the achievements is a serious challenge. Now, getting most of the achievements is relatively easy, once you've gotten good with controlling the character. But the last two ("Marathon" and "Unbreakable") are no joke, and "Undying" isn't a walk in the park either (although I did manage to get that one). That said, for those of you that judge games based on their difficulty (Super Meat Boy fans, etc.) shouldn't pick this up for a persistent, serious challenge because the bulk of the gameplay is...well, it's not what you'd call easy but it's definitely not Super Meat Boy.\n\nFun game, and already one set of free content updates...good stuff!\n\nIf you like this game, check out...

Things get difficult quick, there will be lots of deaths, and the game is all about quick reflexes and precision in timing jumps and moving your character.\n\nI like these types of games that are suited to a shorter playing session. Yes, it is on iTunes for iPhone/iPad (launched 2013), but worth noting it was on XBLIG even further back in 2011. So to disregard this as a cheap mobile game is folly.\n\nGraphics and soundtrack in the game are fine. Nothing spectacular, but not bad either. Worth noting you can choose your color/theme, and also which soundtrack to play. Content is aplenty, and certainly worth $4. Game starts off slow, but within 10 levels you'll start feeling the challenge. For completionists, the 41 levels should keep you occupied and challenged for a bit.\n\nAll in all, if you're a fan of precision platformers, then this would suit you. Or if you just want a challenging game to take your mind off the "AAA" game you're been playing. But if you dislike games of this nature (everyone has their own tastes, right?), then maybe you should stay away.\n\nUPDATE: Really loving the game the more I play it. The achievements are well-done and make you go back and play certain levels either faster, or to get all collectibles.

The first problem becomes evident fairly early on:  the controls stink.  The second problem revealed after several levels in, is that the path you are to take near-impossible to tell.\n\nI reached level 26 before I finally threw in the towel.  I then did the "Endless Run" mode a couple times just to round out my experience with the game.\n\n\nThe Pros:+ Nice idea\n+ Good sensation of speed\n+ Leaderboard\n+ Quite a few levels (41)\n\nThe Eh:~ Graphics and animations are OK.\n\n~ Checkpoints, but...  They have checkpoints, but on the difficult levels they are too far apart.\n\n~ Game seems to be two different games.  Which game are they making?  Seems like the devs couldn't decide between a (all-too-common) 3-path run/jump/slide game as on mobile devices, and a first-person runner.  These completely distinct play styles are used on different levels.  They should have picked ONE and made THAT game.\n\n~ No bonus for speed or additional items?   No additional 'bonus' as far as I could readily tell for collecting additional batteries along the level or finishing much quicker.  I suppose the 1, 2 or 3 lightning bolts for your 'grade', but when there's upwards of 20 to 40 items on the level does an extra few matter?  Or an extra few seconds?  To me, I just got the minimums and moved on and still had many 3-lightning bolt rankings for the levels, so why bother?\n\nThe Bad:- Leaderboard Scoring How?  I have no idea how you score points toward the leaderboard.  I reached level 26 and ran over 2000 "units" in endless mode, yet still have a score of "0".\n\n- Perfect timing required.  Too many times where perfect timing is required.\n\n- Must memorize map too often.  It's not so much a game of skill or reflexes if they put things just out of sight that will kill you (a turn or a hole) unless you prepare on the previous obstacle "just so".  Impossible NOT to die the first time, leaving you having to memorize the course.\n\n- Paths are too narrow.  Jumping from one "I-Beam" (your path) to another "I-Beam" next to you is incredibly difficult given 1) how far apart they make the beams, 2) how slowly you turn, and 3) how narrow the beams are.  This becomes an increasingly common event.\n\n- Reach checkpoint but running too slow to finish level.  You can reach a checkpoint at too slow a speed to complete what is just after that checkpoint.  Thus when you die (as you will), you start at the checkpoint again too slow to complete the next obstacle.  Leaving you no choice but to quit and restart the level from the beginning.\n\nBy level 26 and 2 hours down, I've had enough.  Sorry, I can't recommend this until it gets better controls or removes the need for repeated incredibly precise jumps/actions.","February 22, 2015","false","2.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

It gets increasingly harder, and around 4,000 units, you'll even get to see gaps in the course that you'll have to jump across.\nThere's also the campaign which lasts for a few hours on your first playthrough, although it's hypothetically possible to finish it in about 40 minutes. The campaign has three different modes that the varying stages make use of;\nThe sprint mode is a one-lane course with obstacles, boosting panels and batteries to charge your own boost meter that you can use. The timelimit of these are often strict, and you might just end up having to grind it out 'til near perfection.\nThere's also a freerunning mode that lets you have more free reign over the controls, but it feels vastly different from the other two modes. It does, however, feel like the "main" mode of the campaign. The level design of these levels are generally great, while the other two modes have the movement-limits and thus also in a sense limit the level design.\nThe third and final mode is just as the endless mode, although with static levels instead of randomly generated ones. This also means that there could be elevation differences and other elements that you normally won't find in the endless mode.\n\nOverall, it's a game well worth the few bucks if you're into this kind of game, be it through its aesthetic feel or through gameplay. With the Steam leaderboards you may just end up hooked, like I am!","April 20, 2014","true","58.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The music selection is very good and pumps you up very well. The color theme for the main menu can be changed, which was a nice touch. You have the option of changing your robot character's skin from metallic to wired (to make it match the environment better), and you can also change the point of view from third-person to first-person - I highly recommend first-person to add to the intensity.\n\nThe gameplay consists of you running from point A to B without falling off the track or hitting objects (restarting you at the last checkpoint). You also must collect x batteries in some of the game variants, or else you will have to restart. The control scheme is very simple, and the learning curve is minimal; however, the difficulty progresses at a reasonable rate to keep you challenged.\n\nThere are a few different game variants - there is an Endless mode where you just run as far/long as you can, and campaign consists of: a Free mode much like Pepsi Man, where you control your character and have to collect a minimum number of batteries to progress to the next stage; a Drag mode where you are just running in a straight line and must complete it within a time limit (you have to time your spacebar presses accordingly); and a Track mode, where you can move freely onto one of three tracks (this is how Endless mode is also played). Track mode also prevents you from doing things like bunny hopping off the side of the track and landing back on it in order to avoid difficult obstacles (this is actually a mechanic in Free mode).\n\nThe beginning stages offer quick, simple tutorials to help you speed through the game.\n\nOverall, if you like straight running games, pick this one up.\n\nRecommend!\n\n","July 13, 2014","true","4.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's a running game where you can double jump, slide and boost, and you have to collect batteries while you do it. It's levels are split into two different styles, ones that lock you into one of three lanes and ones that give you complete control over your location/direction. The former is simpler and focuses on coordinating sliding and jumping while the latter levels allow for more creative paths through levels.\n\nThis game is great when you get going extremely fast and the level design accomodates it, but I generally found the game to be a bit boring for the most part. There's not a whole lot to keep you interested. My major gripe with the game is the use of the red "slow-down" arrows that if touched, slow you down to a snail's pace. They are ok when used appropriately with the level design, but usually when you  hit one you have to intentionally kill yourself to restart. Or you might try to finish the rest of the level at the slow pace, only to fail and waste a few minutes. It's quite annoying.\n\nA solid running game nonetheless, I'd wait to get it in a bundle.","May 29, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Be warned though, it's not a relaxing casual game. Most levels are very hard and require you to learn to manoeuvre your robot very precisely. And even then, a lot will often depend on sheer luck, and you will die dozens of times before you succeed.\n\nThere is a large variety of stages, from high speed ones, to the more aerial ones where you perform numerous jumps between platforms, and so on. Some take a form of drag race, where you must time your boosts accurately, others are more open and have multitudes of paths to take through a level.\n\nThe main 'campaign' has 41 levels. There are a lot of tough, frustrating moments, but strangely enough you will keep coming back to the game repeatedly to try and beat the level you're stuck on. Once you complete the campaign, you unlock several bonus levels, which, from what I played so far, seem even harder than the original campaign ones. You also have an endless run level, where you keep running and dodging obstacles for as long as you can.\n\nThe game has a very nice visual style and cool electronic music.

I've enjoyed playing this game to death, but gah it can get really irritating at times. This game is one where you have to be very patient and calm because it will want to make you kill yourself at times. The visuals are awesome, the music is decent but i tend to listen to my own while playing this game, like deadmau5, it's addicting if you can get passed it being a hard game, and overall fun for someone who enjoys being challenged.\nThere are a few issues like with glitching into the floors every once in a while, but, with me at least, I didn't have a huge issue with this.\nI wouldn't suggest trying to get all the achievements unless your like me, a dedicated ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I need one more achievement to have them all but I was about to throw my laptop trying to get the last one. haha it'll probably be more fun to just play the game rather than trying to get the achievements. It may just raise your blood pressure depending if you can handle it or are good enough to do it.\nFor a few dollars, I think this game is worth buying just for a little fun when you need a break from the other games you play.","April 28, 2014","true","19.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you enjoy fast-paced and challenging platforming mixed with a solid soundtrack, then this game is definitely one to check out.”\n\n7.5/10 TJBs","January 30, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You play as TEC a highly advanced robot which is send Virtual space to collect energy for humanity. So how is this game ? I highly suggest you buy this game. Now the game is played like a third person platformer and it works quite well. You mix between a grid level where it plays like temple run and then you have a drag level where you need to hit boost to make it to the exit in time and then theres a free roam level where you controll where you go. Overall the game is really fluid and its alot of fun to play. Graphiclly the game looks great and one of the best indie games ive seen one steam in a while. The game also has quite a good difficulty curve it gets harder as it goes.But there are a few bad things as well. Even though it might sound like a lot theres only 41 stages and a few bonus ones as well but its quite short but theres a sequel in development. Its alot of fun and i suggest you buy it and its worth the full price. I give T.E.C. 3001 an 8/10","August 13, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Its addicting.\n\nSmall note, noticed when i played one time, i could not clear this big gap on this jump, i was double pressing jump at the edge of the track and not making it, so press jump of the edge of the track and then press again when half way over the gap.

A great run/dodge game with challenging levels, clean and crisp graphics, awesome soundtrack. Its a cool game that one can play very quickly.\nT.E.C. 3001 is as if Temple runner, Tron, and Terminator had a kid and decided to let it run free until the end of time. The metal dude himself is very cool looking.  If Terminator, Metallo, Silver Surfer, and Iron man got married and had a child, it would be this cool looking dude. Look at him, he looks so similar to them. Sounds like polygamy, but thats what it looks like, if men were to give birth to children.\nIf you ever enjoyed dodging stuff in temple runner, and other runner games, you'll definitely like what the Endless mode has to offer, as it is nearly identical in feel; three lanes, near instant switching between them, and obstacles that you have to jump over, slide under or just plain avoid, for the rest of your freaking life.\nIf it’s ever on sale, total steal.\nThe only things i dont like is that the controller seems to not work unless i unplug and plug in the controller in the settings window that appears when i first open up the game, and i dont like how it crashes when i die too quickly","July 11, 2014","true","11.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

If you are like me, you'd probably find the experience starts getting stale just halfway into the game, but that's just a personal opinion.\n\nThe reason I'm marking this down though is because the game is missing a very vague feature, the ability to time a double jump, shortly after pressing the jump key you have to press it again to double jump, if you wait too long then you automatically lose that ability, this might not seem like much but it actually closes off a lot of possible fun and interesting maneuvres and is quite frankly infuriating.","April 18, 2014","false","3.1"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","1"

Lane running is awesome until obstacles start to obscure your view...that makes it impossible to prepare for the next move, so you'll only have a split second to make the right decision. Do I jump, dodge, duck or stay in the air? Oops, too late...\n\nFree running is where the spatial awareness problems kick in real hard. You often have to make diagonal jumps, high jumps, descending jumps.....I guess you're supposed to calculate the arc of each jump...it didn't work out too well for me.\nTurning lanes are a nightmare as well. If you don't steer yourself perfectly, you're guaranteed to fly off the lane. It becomes a grind to get through every checkpoint after a while.\n\nIf I managed to reach the end of a more complex level, it was through pure luck, never skill. This soured the experience for me beyond repair. It's too bad, because the feeling of speed is really good in this game, as well as the sound. The visuals were fine, but like I said...I couldn't spot the next obstacle in time if my view was obstructed, if I was moving diagonally, or if there was a large height difference between lanes. Perhaps a more zoomed out camera could have helped my situation...I'm more used to sidescrolling runners, which are much easier to navigate.\n\nI wish I could upvote this game, but I had no fun with it whatsoever :(\n","April 25, 2014","false","1.5"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","4","15","0","0"

For the same price as a mobile phone app, this game delivers the kind of experience which is far too focused for most AAA developers. There are two styles here - one of them is like a rhythm game (e.g. Audiosurf) where you switch between lanes and have a linear path. Another is much more open-ended with multiple paths, variable speed, much more player control. It's this second mode that makes the game interesting. TEC 3001 captures the essence of racing games but without cars. It's all about control, precision, timing, planning ahead and of course, not crashing. The mechanics and controls are very intuitive. The game does a great job of telling you everything through actual gameplay as and when appropriate. There is minimal tutorial/text-reading time. It's straight in the action. There's no pointless story or background rubbish. It's all about the gameplay - which is simple but satisfying. It's exciting, and although that sounds like a simple statement, it's surprising how many games nowadays fail to capture the excitement because they get carried away with presentation and sugar-coating the gameplay around a pointless story. Speaking of which, the visual style and soundtrack suit the game and levels really well. If you like time trial games (think Mirror's Edge) and rhythm games, you will probably enjoy this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/recommended/280910/","Anitude","Annie T. Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","A pretty simple runner game with three kinds of game modes within a few dozen campaign levels to play on. Jump over stuff, double jump over stuff, slide under stuff, and sometimes break shtuff as you progressively get faster and faster during a level. It gets pretty exhilarating. You can even go in first-person mode to somewhat better simulate the fast.\n\nKeyboard & mouse are more in mind for this game because even if I use a controller the tutorial pop-ups show keyboard keys. Both work pretty well in the actual gameplay but some parts of the main menu don't function at all when a controller's used. Changing the simplified-graphics/resolution settings and keyboard/controller inputs can only be done from the configurations that pop-up before the actual game starts.\n\nAs a runner game the objective is pretty simple; run, don't fall, don't hit anything, get to the end. If you get stopped in any way you start back to the last checkpoint hit. You start out running a bit slow so depending on the game mode you usually have to interact with green arrows in some way to get the speed going. Trying to hit the green arrows is often a challenge or the challenge. There are even red arrows that lower your speed and depending on the level they either serve as a means of progression or as an obstacle itself usually & annoyingly with little to no warning. There are a few levels where you'll be too fast to make turns, be too fast to not overshoot a small lone platform you're suppoed to jump on, etc.\n\nThree kinds of game modes within the few dozen levels here, though I don't seem to see each level categorized as such. In "Drag" you run in a straight line with no turning. To increase speed you're to time & press an input as soon your feet hit the speed-indicating green arrows. Mistiming completely slows you down to a degree. As you get faster it's a given that you have to make quicker judgements on what to do as upcoming obstacles close in at a much faster rate. In "Speed" there are three lanes you can instantly switch back and forth to going from one lane to the other as an added means of avoiding death, somewhat similar to Audiosurf's lane-change deal. In "Free" you're able to incredibly slowly turn left and right as you please and in these levels there are usually alternate routes you can go on as well as finding your own alternatives to dodging walls and such, hence the "free".

For everything this game does well, it flubs something else. How much you enjoy this game will depend on how much you enjoy what it does well, and how much you can handle what it doesn't. Some examples: The game gives you a fantastic sense of speed (something I've been personally trying to find lately in games) but it caps that speed at a rather pathetic level. The graphic style is fantastic, but the draw distance is crap. You'll regularly see parts of the level popping in. This doesn't really affect the gameplay since you'll be focused on what's immediately ahead of you. The freerunning gives you a lot of freedom of movement, but your moveset is very low. Why is it that there's a timer on when you can double jump, and if you wait a second too long you can't? It's nice that there are multiple play modes, but annoying that they are shoehorned into the campaign forcing you to go "Sigh, another track-switching level. Gotta get past this so I can hopefully enjoy another freerunning level" Sadly the game ends just as you think it's starting to open up. As I hit the last few levels I started thinking things were really taking off then....done. Its unfortunate that this game didn't add workshop support because that would take it into GOTY territory for me.\n\nThere are other problems but they start to get a bit nitpicky. Level 40 is a mess that combines pretty much everything I hate about the game. Track switching? Check. Dying because you stubbed your toe on a crack in between platforms? Check. "Hill" style tracks that really don't fit this game and pretty much kill your ability to reliably jump? Check. However, at the current price (I don't know if it was ever higher) of $3.99 it is a wonderful game with a few scars that keep it from greatness. I would love to see a sequel that tunes up some of the problems I mentioned, maybe adds character customization, multiplayer, workshop support, etc.","July 26, 2015","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Plus "endless" run.\n\nNEUTRAL:\n-Player movements seem to be the only game mechanics. A handful of booster/slowers in the pre-made levels, but they don't show up in endless run (speed doesn't seem to be a huge value for a runner type game)\n\nCONS:\n-Doesn't seem like going faster really helps you score better\n-Controls for the "free" mode are somewhat sloppy, but the locked lane mode is very crisp\n-Endless mode tracks by distance, not score\n-No daily levels\n-No leaderboards (what!?)\n-No procedural level generation (ideally from my music, but from anywhere would still be desired)\n\nMinor complaints for a game that is overall well done.","February 9, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And i think that is exactly what it is. It's a running simulator based around momentum. I'll make a list because not a lot of people like long reviews:\n\nPro's:\n-Nice soundtrack\n-Nice feeling of speed\n-Great visuals\n-Great level design\n\nCons:\n-Lack of online co-op(would be awesome <3)\n-Kinda short(can be forgiven seeing the price)\n-Is quite bland(it is a runner, thats it.)\n\nFinal verdict: 7.5/10\nIts a nice game for a few hours of entertainment. It's definently worth checking out, in sale or not.","February 24","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only runner that can be beter then this one is mirrors edge and they can be compared. What i most liked about this game is that although it is a linear running game the free running stages let you brake the limits with the various number of moves lke the jump the double jump the dash and the slide and your able to do things that seem like you werent suposed to do. This is the best game to give a genuine sensation of speed because when the robot is running at maximum speed it feels heavy  with  very good visual and sound effects it has decent grphics for what it is . It s really fun has a lot of levels and it is challlenging and doesnt get boring until youve went through the 53 levels at least twice. It is possible to return to a level and try to pull off awesome tricks or get a different path youwent the first time. There is also a multiplayerfor 1 keyboard only that is also very fun and competitive if you have a friend to play with but the biggest problems i found with this is that you need to be qite a lot of time binding the keys so 2 people cn play with all the moves. I give this game a 7/10 in the videogame category and a 10/10 in the runner category. Also for people that have the game try to unlock the bonus level ¨missing one battery¨ it is the best of the game.","July 22, 2014","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
