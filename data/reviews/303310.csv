In the cesspool of bland, sexualized and stereotypical visual novels that has invaded Steam lately this is a fresh experience, both in graphics and in story. But most importantly you have genuine characters with credible human minds, wishes and lives. Only 3 hours in, but there has been very interesting scenarios of love, death, betrayal and happiness.\n\nI have been drawn in quite effectively, and I would recommend it based only on these few hours. It has certainly been worth the money, and I'm convinced it will keep on giving many times more it's worth.","May 14","true","4.7"," 35 of 43 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","35","43","2","2"

The sprites are gorgeous. The characters are all interesting and either very lovable or very hatable (or both). The story explores some interesting themes that aren't very common in visual novels (or novels in general, really). There are a lot of threads that seem unrelated at first but eventually tie together into a satisfying conclusion. In a refreshing change from most VNs, it's not anime style in either its visuals or storytelling. Except that *one scene* that is a huge anime cliche but even then it's at least self-aware about it. This game really loves subverting the player's expectations, but manages to do so without feeling like it's just a bunch of plot twists for the sake of plot twists.\n\nThere's also a demo though it's not available on steam, only mangagamer's site. It covers the first 2 chapters, something like 1/7 of the full game.\n\nNow for the one thing I didn't really like, the game is quite long (not a bad thing in itself) and IMO the pacing occasionally drags. Unfortunately one of the places it drags is roughly the first third of the demo. If you mostly liked the demo but thought it had pacing issues, please don't let that turn you off too much because the vast majority of the game is faster paced than that.\n\nOverall, I really did love this game and it's a refreshing to see such a major departure from the typical visual novel.","May 14","true","235.8"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","1"

A story that is pretty gruesome but it can have some light hearted moments to strike a decent contrast to the despair and messed up things to happen in the game. The whole cast has a purpose to being there and you will feel sad or hatred towards some of the characters which for most of the part seem intentional. The many endings and dead ends are mostly interesting and there is some extra dialogue on a few areas in the game if you play for the second time. Let's not forget one of the biggest stars in the game the OST that helps set everything of the atmosphere. The extra content is actually pretty nice. You get music, art gallery and some other things to look forward after clearing the game. It's mostly beginner friendly on terms of figuring out what to do and there are plenty of save slots for you to save every important moment of decision making.\n\n\nOn the negative side there is a few chapters that can drag with details that people can pretty much figure out themselves while playing. (Nothing wrong with details but sometimes it can be a bit too much), there are some important events that you'll wish could had some CGs and some cases more sprites for more expressions. (This might be mostly me complaining over my adoration of the artstyle)\n\nOverall and probably expected by now I recommend the game for anyone looking to play a pretty darn good visual novel.\n\n+Amazing Art Direction and Atmosphere\n+Outstanding OST\n+Great CGs\n+Really Good Story\n+Interesting Endings + Dead Ends\n+Characters are pretty fleshed out and play the role they should therefore getting your like or dislike of them.\n+Nice Extras\n\n- Some pretty cliche writing on parts of the starting chapters which mostly was intentional for future parts of the story but still doesn't change that it was expected..\n- Could have more sprites and CGs for some events that seemed pretty important.\n- Pacing issues (It can drag a bit too much on a few chapters)\n\n","May 22","true","44.8"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

I have not finished this by any means, but if the remainder of the story keeps up with the quality presented in the first chapter (and whatever part of the second chapter I'm currently on), it's well worth the twenty-or-so odd dollars (although I would recommend the bundle with the soundtrack even further, as it is both haunting as it is beautiful in the given setting).\n\nFrom what I can tell of the VN, it is a collection of stories set across different periods of time, and I believe they will all interconnect within the finale - or whenever "You", the main character, remembers who they are as well as their purpose. There are no happy endings to the tales within Fata Morgana, as the mansion itself curses its inhabitants with misfortune at every turn, but that's just part of the charm of what could possibly be the most mature visual novel released in the west. My fingers are crossed that this title will do well enough that similar titles will pursue localization, so make that impulse purchase and spread the word far and wide. If you enjoy suffering as much as I do, you will enjoy "The House in Fata Morgana".","May 14","true","17.4"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

And that's precisely what the majority of people do.\nAt first glance, The House in Fata Morgana tells tales of not romance, friendship and innocence: it mainly tells tragedies of breakdowns, betrayals and scheming. It ruthlessly delves into the bottom of despair, but it is only to better bring us back up to the realms of hope.\n\nAs an anti-hero would take the place of a hero, The House in Fata Morgana skillfully casts an anti-romantic story over a ramification of several stories, and it is absolutely worth it.\n\nYou can try to remember the past, but it's an absolute, utter waste of time. Erase everything - all your sorrows. Wipe them away for a fistful of happiness. Allow me to show you... that you have no need of the past.\n\nThe House in Fata Morgana has several settings and tells stories of multiple settings. The adolescence of a young brother and her sister, and the blooms of love and their consequences. A journey through the highway to insanity and hopes of salvation. An ever daunting gap between husband and wife and their own attempts, struggles and misadventures. Unfortunate circumstances clash with a life of isolation.\n\nAs vague as I'm trying to make them, these tales, in truly stylish gothic aesthetics, are spread across centuries of each other. It does a good job of keeping things moving and ensures variety of events.\n\nThat was your first time witnessing those tragedies. [...] You were able to bear 'em because they weren't your tragedies.\nThe tragedies bear great impact in their appeal to us to empathize and pity the protagonists. They make us despair for them because they make us hope that all will end well. In that, the writing is successfully fulfilling and greatly delivering the feelings behind the stories. The way it builds up to the second half of the VN is absolutely enthralling and really engaging.\n\nThe House in Fata Morgana, as a visual novel, is quite unconventional. It really is, in the best ways. I must also commend all the work that went into the localization, because practically nothing read or felt as something that came specifically from Japan (well, except for that one guy, but even then he just felt exotic), or Japanese tropes. It's absolutely refreshing, in a medium where so many devices, settings and tropes get used and reused so ubiquitously.\n\nAt times, I would find the art odd looking, but it's overshadowed by how beautiful, stylish and gorgeous some of the CGs look. Frankly enough, the main reason why some people (myself included) weren't immediately seduced by the art style is because they are not used at all to this style. Overall though, it's great for the eyes, especially to wash away the excess of moe blobs.\n\nThe OST is unusual and unlike many things in this world. But again, this VN detaches itself well from many things in this world. It can be enchanting, sorrowful or downright bewitching. I'm personally way more used to instrumentals in VNs, so having most of them vocalized is a different experience. There is no voice acting though, but adding on the previous point, I think vocalized OST wouldn't clash well with voice acting.\n\nThe characters are flawed, but that is the main drive of the novel. How they are flawed though feels deeply human, especially when there's always reasons or motives to how they are acting like they are. Well, almost human anyway. At times, they might feel repetitive, but they are mostly coherent and worthy of the stories they took part in.\n\nMy greatest complain about The House in Fata Morgana will be in its technical implementation. While it is usable, and at times, really well exploited, it feels older than it is, and not in a gothic way. In contrast to everything else about it, the interface doesn't try to do much things differently than in other VNs; in fact, I'd say it does less than average when it comes to immersion (other than by the story itself). Perhaps it is a good thing, as the UI keeps out of the way of the story, leaving us devoted only to it, but I would have liked to have seen more effects for immersion. Perhaps a bit of screen shaking, more animations, subtle SFX... There's definitely room for improvement.\n\nStill, all in all, The House in Fata Morgana belongs to the realm of top-tier stories, and I would love to see more visual novels in this style. Or just ones that delves that well into uncommon topics and unexploited settings.","May 28","true","37.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

I even had goosebumps.\n\nThough I hesitate to call this a "game" in any traditional sense, it is a fantastically wonderful novel. Moreover, it's of my most favored genre, the "mindxxxx" genre. You think you have some idea of where things are going, then comes the big reveal. I've only come remotely close to correctly guessing the climax of one of the doors, and even then there were surprises.\n\nTruly a wonderful experience so far.\n\nAs for the technical stuff:\nVisually: The character design is wonderful. I appreciate that little detail was spent on the bachdrops and instead effort was concentrated on the actors themselves. The various emotions captured on their faces is very well done.\n\nAudibly: The music is beautifully done. There is a song to match every mood, from lite and cheerful to dark and eerie. By default it was a bit loud for my liking, but once I adjusted the settings it became a perfect "cherry on top" to the visuals and writing.\n\nFinally, the writing: They say to save the best for last, and that's what I decuded to do. The writing for this VN is truly wonderful, both plot-wise and in format. It's not so relaxed that it reads like your average conversation, but not so formal that it's Shakespearean, On several occasions the most subtle detail has later revealed itself to be of the utmost importance, and conversely something that might typically be very important in other novels turns out to be of little consequence.

The estimate I've seen is between 10 hours (if you get the shortest route) and 30 hours if you get the complete story (which I did), and that seems about right.\n\nI really enjoyed this, it's by far one of my favourites if not my favourite VN and would stack pretty highly even if it had been written as a book. I only got one alternative ending (4) and it was nice to see that it contributes a tiny bit of a different perspective, though the objective is to get at the bottom of the mystery.\n\nAs you can gather from the video and the screenshots, the atmosphere is rather Gothic, though I think that the screenshots aren't necessarily representative of the entirety of the art quality: if you think the art is really nice there, just wait until you get to chapter 5 and you'll see there's a jump in quality and a few new sprites look even nicer than the ones in the first few chapters.\n\nStory-wise, to avoid spoilers, I could say that this is mainly a story about relationships in the widest meaning of the word. It's about the bad things and the good things that people do, and sometimes the bad things are done for entirely understandable reasons, while the good things might be ultimately motivated by self interest. The narrator isn't really judgemental, and I thought it was an incredibly nice thing to see particularly in this day and age.\nIf you'd rather have a nuanced look at a group of characters, rather than people to either hate or love, you will probably like this one. I absolutely adored it.\n\nI found that every time I thought I understood what was going on, something changed my perspective and added more mystery and made me want even more to understand exactly what went on. Even once you actually understand what the main conflict is, you'll probably find that you'll go from almost hating some characters to understanding and empathising with them. I felt like I was on an emotional roller coaster.\n\nThere are a few revelations throughout the narrative and I found myself jaw-dropping at the surprises. There is absolutely zero filler, too. It's all so engaging I found myself clicking to see the next line of text with great impatience.\nFrom what I could tell, there were no mistakes in the editing phase and the translation seemed good to me, though I'd point out that English isn't my first language, so I might not notice more subtle problems with the editing.\n\nThere are no voices, aside from the vocals in the many songs in the OST, but I didn't think the experience suffered from it. If anything, there's one particular aspect of the story that would have made it really hard to choose at least a couple of voice actors.\n\nThe options in the menu are rather nice. You can easily set the speed of the text in milliseconds and tailor the Auto Mode to your needs with great precision. I use that a lot as I find it less painful than clicking (due to RSI), but I ended up ditching it as I said earlier, as the story was just too engaging to wait.\nThe saving and loading screens are quite interesting, too: the most recent save is marked clearly and you can "lock" save files. This means that if you have save files that you absolutely want to go back to to hunt for endings, you can be sure you won't overwrite them by mistake.\n\nThe music is incredibly fitting. At first I found it peculiar to have so many vocal tracks, but I ended up feeling that the usual piano tracks that are often the meat of a lot of VNs' soundtracks just wouldn't have given the same atmosphere. Gao's voice is really something else and I didn't hesitate to buy the soundtrack along with the VN.\n\nReally, if you're looking for a dark story sprinkles with some more optimistic moments and for something that isn't about dating a selection of girls or boys, you should give this a try. There's a lot of content and the production values are really high.","May 27","true","44.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Honestly however I think that description tells a tiny bit more about the story then I would like, so if you are someone who hasn’t already read it, then my recommendation is to not read that synopsis or any of this review (or just skip to the summary at the bottom) and buy the game if you are interested.  This visual novel has without a doubt earned its place among my favorites, and it is well worth your time/money in my opinion if you are a fan of story driven VN’s.\n\nAnyways, to move on to what I have to say about the game, the way this synopsis describes the story is…ambitious…to say the least.  The promise of a story “spanning nearly a millennium” and incorporating numerous stories from different time periods is one that always makes me suspicious despite the high potential it might indicate for the story.  Perhaps I’m too jaded, but too many times I’ve seen similar promises not fully delivered on, generally either from wrapping everything together in a mostly nonsensical way, or from not wrapping anything up at all and keeping the separate stories as mostly that—separate.  Despite that apprehension though, I am happy to say that The House in Fata Morgana is one of the exceedingly rare cases that delivers in full, creating a complete story that is both entirely satisfying and befitting the scale of that claim.  Obviously I’m not going to say anything more here, but the way the story unfolds and wraps itself up is what I consider the greatest accomplishment of this visual novel.\n\nOn a related note, I’d also like to touch on the characters here since--as with most cases--they’re the driving forces of the story.  For whatever reason, another thing I was hesitant about going into this story was that the characters might come across as dull or lifeless, or might take second stage to the shock factor (for lack of a better term) of the tragedies which occur. I can again say though that this turned out not to be the case.  I ended up loving most of the characters from this story, and with few exceptions they felt human in the best possible way.  There is no reliance on typical character archetypes; they  have believable motivations for their actions; and the writers have incorporated both light and darkness (or good/evil or however you like to think of it) into every character in the story.  And, it is this imperfectly human portrayal of the characters that makes the various emotional highs and lows of the story that much more impactful.\n\nThe last main thing I’d like to say is that this VN is great at setting whatever atmosphere the story needs at that point (and there are a variety of different atmospheres—not just the bleak depression you see at the start of the game).  I think there’s better ways to get a feel for this than by reading a review (see for example the promo material on the Steam page), so I’ll mostly leave it at that.  I will however draw attention to the OST which is probably the largest contributing factor to this and is very good at its job.\n\nAnyways, I think that’s everything I wanted to specifically talk about, so I’ll just provide a brief overview of my overall opinion below.  All in all though I think this is a fantastic VN, and it’s one I’d recommend to anyone who is at all interested in what it has to offer.\n\nGood points:\n--Powerful and far-reaching story which delivers on all sides of the emotional spectrum and brings everything together nicely.\n--For those fans of tragedy specifically, this delivers in spades on that front.\n--Well-written characters that are both compelling and convincing.\n--Unique atmosphere which adds to the tragic and mysterious feel of the story\n--Diverse OST that complements the story well.\n\nBad points:\n--There are no voices, which I generally think can add a lot to VN’s\n--Minor pacing issues at some points","May 24","true","22.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I actually regreted not buying the OST on my initial purchase, because it's definitely  worth the extra price.\n\n\nThings I didn't like quite as much: (This is just a personal opinion, and should be taken as such value)\n\n-The story, although very well written, has a lot of unnecesary filling. It could have done with at least three hours less, and it wouldn't have failed to comunicate all it's complexity. I understand the importance of a long game, but I found some scenes a bit too repetitive.  The scenes in Chapter 2 with Pauline and Javi, could have been solved in one take instead of three, for example.\n\n\n- The art has the slightest anatiomical error every now and then. (Again, this is just nitpicking).\n\n- Some of the backgrounds and some of the enviromental details,  like the painting in Chapter 1,  are distorted in such a way, that they fail to really comunicate.\n\n-Given the lenght of some scenes, the repetition of a single song over and over diminishes the apreciation I had for the piece in itself. The song can be beautiful, but after hearing it ten times non-stop, it loses a bit of it's charm.\n\n- The aspect ratio >_<\n\n- The speed of the menus is way too slow.\n\nYet again, those things are quite minimal, and do not change the fact that this is a great game.\n\nI would give this a 10/10. And seriously recomend it in its deluxe version.","June 5","true","17.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Give it patience, and you'll find an emotional masterpiece with almost unmatched power.   Get past the PAINFULLY slow chapter one... once you're past the first hour or two, WHOOOO BOY brace yourself.  The writing, while sometimes needlessly over-the-top verbose, is so good in total it's "re-examine your own life" epic.  The HARD LEFT TURN the story makes after the fourth chapter: genius.  In fact all the reveals are inspired.  Music: quite simply the finest soundtrack (outside of chapter one, which was absolutely obnoxious) I've ever heard in a game.   The music by itself will bring the tears in chapter four and the final 10%, it's that powerful.    You just gotta get past chapter one.  I promise you, your patience will be well rewarded....    has the most satisfying true ending I've ever come across.","June 5","true","12.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
