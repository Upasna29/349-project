Naturally, it's unskippable or I wouldn't whinge about it. Every time you start up this game you spend 15 or so seconds watching digital paint dry so you can be reminded of who made it.\nOnce you reach the menu, you can change settings, get a description of the player ships, and "Star Game." "Star"-ing the game allows you to get a bit of understanding of the game's story in audio and comic format, but only a bit. The comic may or may not be well drawn. It's hard to tell, as it looks like it was passed through so many filters in photoshop it's almost nothing more than grimy blotches of paint split up into frames, and the voice-over is somewhat hard to understand.\nAfter the comic, there is something that technically qualifies as gameplay. The ship controls don't feel very smooth or natural, enemies fire clouds of smoke that blend in with the background, and floating powerups may randomly speed you up, slow you down, or lock an axis of movement. As someone who's played a decent amount of shmups both on Steam and off, randomly screwing over the player or hitting him with things he cannot see are not generally considered good elements of gameplay in the genre.\nOther than that, the enemies and powerups seem to be randomly placed, dying advances the level, and there aren't any animations for ship movement.\n\nKeep my thirteen pennies, dev guy. Keep them, and when you're planning to release  your next game, ask the pennies, "Have I really made a complete product, or should I keep working?" They won't respond. Pennies can't talk. But in your heart, you'll know the answer.","August 3, 2015","false","2.9"," 127 of 138 people (92%) found this review helpful 72 people found this review funny","92","127","138","72","6"

That's all you get for a game story.\nOnce the actual playing begins you find yourself in a spaceship shooting at random ships and asteroids that fly across your screen. Destroying an enemy ship will release a blue aura/cloud that is collected by your ship and fills the bottom 'Lvl' bar, once it is completely filled a sound is played, the backdrop changes and the bar will now say 'Lvl 2'. After a couple of bars are filled a boss will appear.\nWhen the boss was killed, I would expect the game to slow down a bit and maybe have some proper level/story progressing but instead the screen suddenly freezes and you are rewarded with a message that says "This is a Demo" "The Main Menu will be loaded in a few seconds" - That was when I began to laugh really hard.\n\nThis game has 15 different types of enemies and 5 bosses - that's what the Steam trailer says, I have fought four of the bosses and they all can be easily destroyed by holding the shoot button, just like any other of the 15 enemies, except maybe for the round white ship which is the only thing that doesn't runs in a flawless straight line through your screen.\n\nAlthough I could go on and talk about sound, visuals and such, I will end this review here because I believe that the fact this game is apparently just a demo, with no real challenges or story progression, is enough to justify why you shouldn't buy Stellar 2D.\n\n0/10 - Hold spacebar to Win and the Main Menu will be loaded in a few seconds.","July 30, 2015","false","2.5"," 87 of 95 people (92%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","92","87","95","17","2"

No subtitles combined with cheap voice acting.  Against this backdrop the old 'someone set us up the bomb' -level of hilariously bad intro to a game is wonderful compared to this plain bad intro.\n\nGameplay does have some ambition with the power-ups. All the rest? just plain bad. After trying a bit to get into the game i just can't. Music doesn't help much.  This really does remind me of the 90s comp sci class projects.\n\n\n- Original review -\n\nWell the dev dun goofed with this release. Lets do a quick listing:\n\n1. Main menu. it is indeed stuck as some have reported. No way around it as the main menu is just there. it is clickable and active as an overlay over the game events itself or sub-menus. You can even start game - when you are already in a game you just started.\n\nJust to be sure i tested on 1920x1080 Full screen and the much lower recommended default setting + windowed. Nope, menu is still there.\n\n2. Typos. such as 'star game' in main menu when you want to start the game.\n\n3. Unskippable intro videos. everything is UNSKIPPABLE.  I measured how long it takes to reach main menu after the game is launched and window is visible. It takes 41 seconds.\n\nI'll check this review again once the game is actually working. dev has noted the problems it seems.","July 30, 2015","false","2.9"," 54 of 63 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","54","63","5","6"

Plus, I encountered the world's easiest boss. A huge ship slowly came into view, and I prepared for a fight. Then I shot it once and it blew up, and I burst into laughter.

If you like the game and want to get it, go ahead! I have no problems with that. :)\nOk, so I'm one of those guys that usually likes almost every game out there, but this game? It has so much problems in it, but first let me tell you a short story summary about this game:\nIt's basically about this planet, Astreal 3 being invaded by some alien spaceships or something and your job is to protect the planet by destroying these spaceships. That's it.	Now that's out of the way, let's get to the problems:\nThe main menu gets in the way no matter where you are, and it gets very annoying. (Although I heard the devs are fixing this)\nThe options from the options menu don't even work! I tried turning down the music and sound, but they stay the same.\nTypos, and I've never seen typos in any game ever such as the "star game" button on the main menu. There's more problems, but I can't list them all.\nThe gameplay is "meh" at most. It takes place in a space battle which you shoot spaceships and random obstacles that come your way and you can collect "powerups" that either give you an advantage or a disadvantage. The boss battles, although the Steam trailer said there was 5, I only fought 1 and after you defeat the boss, there will be a message saying that this is a demo and takes you back to the main menu a couple of seconds later. What is this?!\n\nThis here is an example of a good space battle just to get an idea of comparison, but think of this as a 2D battle rather than 3D.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPgujWNatnI\n\nThe only thing I liked about this game is the music and the fact there are trading cards. While I find the music okay such as the main menu music, the trading cards is what made me buy this game along with this game being cheap for only 13 cents. Just make the badges and you don't have to ever play this game again.\n\nShould you buy this game?\nUnless you're looking for a really cheap game and/or making badges from the trading cards, then go ahead.

With an addictive, fast paced, casual game-play style.”\n\nThis quote has some truth to it, but also some lies. Stellar 2D is a retro style space arcade game but it is NOT addictive. In fact, this game seems quite incomplete and quite bad at the moment. HOWEVER, there is some potential buried deep within Stellar 2D. The overall idea isn’t bad or original. It’s basically a bullet hell, casual space arcade game. Sounds like a fun game right? WRONG! Currently there are SO many problems that Stellar 2D isn’t fun.\n\n-Random status effects prevent horizontal or vertical movement.\nLike WTF! These effects are the most annoying part about Stellar 2D. These so called “power-ups” make this game unbearable.\n\n-Virtually invisible bullets\nThese “bullets” (I use that term loosely) are practically invisible 99% of the time. It makes this game not fun and just bad, unless the idea was that in the future bullets (all except you’re bullets) are undetectable.\n\n-Game’s Menu / HUD\nDo NOT get me started about this menu or HUD. Although the developer had fixed SOME issues, it’s still s*** and visually unappealing. Like what’s up with the font?\n\n-Graphics\nThe game’s graphics are s*** at best. The opening cut scene’s graphics was the worst that I’ve ever seen in a game…EVER! It’s just not good.\n\n-Sound Effects\nGave me permanent, PERMANENT hearing damage, 11 / 10.\n\n-Space Crafts\nMany appear to be unoriginal and copied.\n\nWhat also “bugs” me about Stellar 2D is that there are STILL bugs (see what I did there) in this game, mainly with the menu. On August 5th 2015, I launched Stellar 2D to find the audio disappeared the moment I clicked on the menu. Although (for this game) no sound is better than sound…this shouldn’t happen. Now I know the developers did fix some issues but still, COME ON! This would be understandable if this game was in early access, but it’s not!\n\nMy final comments on this game are, I’m glad I got it for $.15. At this stage, it’s really, REALLY not worth purchasing. However, I like the idea. If the developers can fix this game up then I’ll gladly change my review from negative to positive.\n\nI really hope that this game will eventually meet my standards but as of now…it’s just painful.\n\n-Mr_Kagabond","August 2, 2015","false","2.9"," 29 of 37 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","29","37","3","2"

So you have to click the menu buttons with your mouse and then switch to your controller which is bothersome and bad UI design. My mouse cursor disappears in the main menu also.\n\nThe screen was too small, and by that I don't mean the resolution. The logo's got cut-off on my screen at the left and right side. Besides that, there is very little room to manouver your ship. You can't even defeat a basic enemy when using your non-upgraded gun and staying still. The enemy will shoot either twice or once and you can't stay in the line of fire. So you have to rely on upgrades in order to actually kill anything.\n\nThe upgrade-system is funny. There are two kinds of upgrades: weapon and 'movement'. The first one upgrades your weapon to either triple, double-triple or double shot. The second either slows or speeds you up, fixes your position horizontally or vertically (all with matching sound effects) or gives you double damage. This causes the game to feel random and unpredictable, which can be fun but I thought it was irritating since you can't rely on upgrades to help you.\nIt felt to me like I got more of the negative upgrades than the positive ones.\n\nThe graphics are ok for a Unity game.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game to anyone unless they balance it more.

By then you should already have noticed that windowed mode cuts off the screen if it's too small. Then you come to the menu, which you will be seeing a lot since it is burned into the damn screen. The controls are pretty basic, nothing to complain about there, and the menu design overall isn't bad. You click play, followed by an unskippable cutscene with low resolution pictures ripped from the internet. The game starts, and what happens? Ships fly everywhere and are past the screen in two seconds. They take quite many shots to kill for this type of game, making hitting them without getting hit basically impossible. If you're into Star Wars you'll also notice a certain ARC-170 Starfighter. This is probably a first effort, so for that it could be much worse. I do want the creator to keep going, he/she'll probably get a lot better with time. In the future, don't steal things like ship designs or pictures.

This game just doesn't deliver on any sort of enjoyment. While there's no way the dev is making anything off this title, it still feels like nothing more than something thrown together overnight as a quick, cheap cash grab. The game doesn't offer much at all in terms of gameplay, and what it does do, it does very poorly compared to games similar to it. Also, there were some MAJOR oversights by the dev that cannot be overlooked under ANY circumstances. While it's fixed now, upon release there was a menu bug that prevented anyone from playing the game. I don't care if the game is free, or $80, bugged releases should NEVER be accepted or tolerated for that matter. There should always be thorough testing with any release to ensure the game is fully playable, and EVERY developer needs to get out of the mindset of "release it now, if it's buggy and doesn't work, we can just patch it later" .... no. With any game, it should be fully functional and playable day one. That aside, this game's not even entertaining in the slightest. Any game time I have beyond 5 minutes is from apparently not shutting the game down before I went to bed. Bottom line...if you buy this game, think of it as giving to charity, because there's nothing redeeming about the game itself. It has no soul to t whatsoever, and otherwise feels literally like a cash grab in every way. You don't show people what you do as developers by releasing a pile of garbage that nobody will enjoy.\n\nP.S. Devs should make the sequences SKIPPABLE, so you don't have to wait roughly 3 minutes to get to the gameplay.","July 31, 2015","false","7.0"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

You have to wait for the game to launch, and once you are in the game you must watch a long, unskipable cut sceen every time you wish to play.  Once you are in the game, you fight ships and avoid obsticles.  The problem is that the projectiles that the enimies fire at you blend in with the background.  Another problem is that when you pick up a power up, giant blue words pop up and block most of the screen making it hard to see what is going on in that part of the screen.  Other then the problems I have mentioned above, It seems like it has some potential.  I think I will Check back later to see if the problems are fixed.

Even simple things like the sound and music sliders are done poorly (this is in unity, and they are clearly not getting the slider value from the saved preferences when they load the scene).   I couldn't figure out whether "Star Game" is a typo or just a really bad name for playing.\n\nThe power-ups, such as they are, are mostly random, and all last for just a short period of time.  This is a good thing, because power-ups can be negative as well as positive, like slowing down your ship for 30 seconds, or making you unable to fire for 30 seconds.\n\nThe objects on the screen are huge compared to the play area, which means that it is really easy to hit and to be hit.  Also, enemy shots often appear to have faint particle trails attached to them, without any actual image for the projectile.  This means you can't see many of the enemy bullets that are coming at you.  That is devastating for a bullet hell type game.\n\nAlso, the art is all over the place in terms of quality.  Either they have an artist that is really not very good, or they bought assets from a variety of places, and then just threw them all together without thinking if it made for a visually coherent experience.  Speaking of visual incoherence, your ship is set up in a side scrolling mode, but the particles in the background come straight at you as if they were purchased for a flight simulator.\n\nAll in all the whole thing just does not work.  The game is needlessly difficult due to randomly bad powerups and invisible bullets.  The art is a mess.  The options don't work right.  They didn't even put an intro graphic in the unity launch screen.\n\nI assume this is someone's first attempt at a game.  Don't waste your money on it.\n\n1/10","October 17, 2015","false","4.9"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

Its graphics make me cringe. DO NOT BUY: 0.5/10\n\n[IN-DEPTH REVIEW]\nYou still really want to buy this disgusting game? Fine, I'll explain.\n\nConsidering the fact I bought this during a sale where it was 86% off, and I still disagree that it was worth the sum I payed for it, says a lot, the cards are worth more than the game, if you are trying to harbour in some quick profit off just simple selling the cards you get for playing the game. But, I can't really do that, because it is just too boring. The game is mediocore and boring, and I question my sanity while playing this game... after about 5 minutes of playing this game, I can't stomach this game, because it is just so bad.\n\nStarting with the opening, you can tell that this is going to be a very bad game, the graphics are terrible, and it looks like a flash game, I still can't believe I bothered to get this game, because it is absolutely shocking, sure I managed to survive for about 30 minutes, before I said to myself, "Do I really want to play this "game"?", in short, no, I spent more time downloading it then playing it, not that my internet is good or anything, but because the game is so boring and childish it disgusts me.\n\nIn terms of the gameplay, it is appalling, considering the fact the developer had the nerve to put this game out, and you couldn't play it at the time, is shocking, not like the actual game was good in the first place, I have seen better games produced with the software used. The ships themselves look like a cross-over from FTL, and Star Wars, after reducing the quality a ton, none to mention the opening to the first mode I clicked on, which took about 5 minutes to get through, with worse graphics than 144p.\n\nReplayability? Why would you even want to play this game in the first place? Let alone play it again, the most enjoyable moment in the game, for me, was clicking "Quit Game".\n\nNow, the only redeeming quality, the cards, the cards are great because, you can make the money back you wasted on this disgusting thing the creator calls a game, or you can get a really cheap badge out of it, which are both much more beneficial than playing this game, after scrolling through the enterity of positive reviews, it was purely, "Good game for steam cards, then never touch again", and that is so true.\n\nFinally, the soundtrack, IT IS DISGUSTING, my ears are still pounding from the thing the creator calls music.\nApologies for any mistakes, I'm not fluent in English.\nAnd on that bombshell...\n\nGood night!","August 1, 2015","false","1.1"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","14","21","2","0"

It is not worth a dollar, it is not even worth a sale price.  This should not be "sold" at all, but given away freely only to the designer's closest friends who will then probably never play any other games he makes again.\n\nAs far as arcade shooters go, the controls are clunky, the graphics are not coherent with eachother (and other than the spaceships  are very ugly), and the powerups? are confusing.  Most of what you encounter with your ship is a randomized effect (almost always negative) with little or no explanation.  When you do get a weapon upgrade it barely lasts any length of time.  The enemies are huge on the screen as is their fire, your ship is also too big for the screen size making it very difficult to dodge anything.\n\nI played this for a very short period of time and found no enjoyment what-so-ever.

The ship is fairly hard to control in contrast to most 2-D shooters out there. Pressing up and left while shooting will cause the ship to ignore your input, making it harder to maneuver around enemy projectiles. Some of the bullets are difficult to see, particularly the linear bullets that are mildly faded. It’s not too big of problem, but I’ve died so many times not knowing what just hit my ship until the last second. The biggest problem I have with the enemy bullets is the sound it makes when the enemy ship fires one. The default audio level of the sound effect greatly contrasts the default audio level of the background music and you will constantly hear the same few sound effects every second. The red, blue, and green sphere thingy (Note: I don’t know its official name) is the most annoying mechanic in the game for me. Basically, its risk versus reward. You can either get a speed boost, power boost, or one of the major debuffs the game has to offer. These debuffs occur way more than it should and it destroys any chance you have at surviving. These debuffs include: no horizontal movement, no vertical movement, having your ship slow down, and worst of all, the inability to shoot. The inability to shoot not only allows you to become more susceptible to damage, it also hinders your progress towards making it to the next level. Finally, the bosses are a joke. No really, they only exist to randomly show up and die in less than three seconds.\n\nAs much as the bad stuff outweighs the good with this game, some of the good ideas this game has seems faintly innovative. I like the leniency of this game. The amount of HP it gives, the shield mechanic, and the rate the health packs spawns lends the game to a more casual audience. The amount of health the enemies have, make the gameplay fast-paced and mildly amusing compared to the average shoot ‘em up. The range upgrades makes the game somewhat enjoyable for me. Having an edge over your enemies when using this upgrade is satisfying to say the least. If I could say anything bad about it, it’s that you’re not able to pick up a better range upgrade until your current one runs out. That and the fact you can only keep it for a limited amount of time.\n\nOverall, the game felt unsatisfying. With a decent idea, bad gameplay, and that unskippable logo sequence, I would recommend getting it only for the trading cards.\n","August 3, 2015","false","2.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

You know you're in for a treat with a horribly voice-acted, photoshopped slide show intro. Then you get thrown right into a bad, clunky 2D shooter action. "Action".

The main menu was always prominently displayed, even while playing the game. This menu took up probably half the screen, so most players had no idea what was going on. Before long, the developed issued a patch that fixed this problem.\n\nUnfortunately, that just makes Stellar 2D's other massive faults easier to discover. This is a survival-based 2D shooter, only you can never really tell what's going on. As is typical of the genre, you have to fly around and dodge bullets. Problem is, the bullets are hard to see, and their hit-boxes are impossible to determine. Most of the time, you only survive thanks to RNG sending lots of armor and shield refills your way.\n\nWhile you're trying to figure that mess out, certain tri-colored powerups will fly on-screen. Usually these items are bad news; they cause you to stop shooting, fly very slowly, or become unable to move in certain directions. Supposedly this is a "risk vs reward" setup. So I have to ask: Where is the reward? There's a 5% chance I'll get something good, or at least something that won't lead to death. The odds aren't worth it, so I have to try and dodge those powerdowns, as well as the practically invisible bullets. Awful controls, terrible graphics, and decent music round out this package.\n\nI think I liked this game better back when it still had the main menu bug.\nIt's as if Frankenstein's monster had a goiter. The goiter was removed, but that still leaves a creature that should not exist.","August 11, 2015","false","3.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

It could be worse, but it certainly could be a whole lot better.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Price is cheap, even when not on sale, which is a good thing for such a small arcade game.\n\n+ I have to admit I do like the ship design and graphics, they remind me of old sci-fi games I'd play back in the day.\n\n+ There is a story and background info. If you click on the media button you can can get some information on all of the ships you encounter in the game.\n\n+ The ability to choose your own ship, although it can get a little confusing (I'll get into that later.)\n\n+ There are a variety of ships to fight and powerups to collect.\n\n+ Local highscores.\n\n+ Semi-expensive trading cards.\n\n+ The people who work on it seem to update it quite often, so at least they're comitted to making the game better.\n\nSidegrade things (I don't know what they're called.)\n\n= Music is meh. Could be better, could be worse.\n\n= The overall graphics. It's a Unity game.\n\n= Controls are okay.\n\n= Controller support. I haven't tested it out yet so I'm not sure if the controls are terrible or not so that's why I'm only putting it as a sidegrade.\n\nCons:\n\n- Some things are really confusing. Like the ship selection screen. The first two stats make enough sense. Speed and Health. But then there's attack. Attack is a 100% on the first ship, but on the second and third ship it's either -20 or +20. What does that even mean? Same thing for the next stat, damage. And that being said what is the difference between attack and damage? Another thing that was very confusing for a while was the fact that those blue electricity orbs that fly at your ship are actually XP points, not an attack. There are a few other instances of this throughout the game.\n\n- The difficulty. This game is way too hard (For me at least.) Because the ships are so huge. The screen of your computer is only so big and so it makes it amazingly hard to dodge attacks, especially with multiple ships coming for you.\n\n- The game has a story, but I really can't understand the cutscenes because: A: The illustrtations are way too dark, to see, and honestly, they aren't that bad themselves. And B: The weird sound effect that the voice has makes it really hard to understand as well.\n\n- These weird solar system things come flying at you (They kind of look like the antigravity powerups from Marble Blast Gold come to think of it.) and they seem to always have a different effect, which really doesn't make too much sense.\n\n- The background is a static image of some generic sci-fi scene that does not scroll whatsoever.\n\n- Grammar errors. Now I understand that Steam is used by people all around the world and that some devs who make their game in a non-native language to them might make a few mistakes, but this game just has way too many. Some examples are. "GO SLOW" or "STAR GAME" or "HORIZONTAL FREEZED."\n\n- Animation and movement of the ship is very bad. My ship seems to constantly have some orange thing on the front jumping around in different colors, and the movement has no momentum at all; you can zip around unrealistically without starting off going a bit slower.\n\n- The text used gets annoying after 30 seconds and then you just feel dyslexic.\n\n- Probably something else I forgot.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nOverall, I don't recommend this game. Again, it could be worse, but it could be so much better. I must say I kind of like the classic shoot 'em up flash game feel, but still not a great game. Pick it up on sale, test it out, and make some trading card profit.\n","October 11, 2015","false","2.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Totally worth a dollar, even more so for 13 cents. I bought this about 8 times over to play a rather expensive (for me) joke on my friends.\nAt any rate, if you buy at this price, the cards are worth more than the game, and you profit.\nStill might be fun at other times, at very least to distract your six-year-old for a while. Or yourself, if your lifestyle is plain and your tastes are simple. Don't expect X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter or anything. Think old arcade, last century kind.\nMy only real complaints are the following: debuffs last WAY too long, graphics at different resolutions in windowed mode cause it to clip through the taskbar and things, and invisible cursor in menu screens. Oh yeah, and the window still responds when it is minimised. Other than that, here's how it is: gameplay is indeed fast paced as per the description, navigation is limited to moving and shooting, and everything has healthbars. There's an intro sequence, but I don't think there's an end to this game. That's probably a minus in itself, but it doesn't take away from general gameplay. Graphics are remarkably good for an arcade game, except for the fact that your ship doesn't disappear after exploding. That's probably bug, but it's amusing to watch. I approve. You ran out of health, fire-cloud, and your ship keeps sailing on like nothing until the world resets a second or so later. On another note, if you are one of those people with little to no sense of humour and high expectations of a game, keep away from this one unless you're a masochist, in which case you should keep your money and go get help because you need it REALLY badly.\n\n\n\n\n\nPervert.","August 1, 2015","true","0.6"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","11","20","3","0"

Well, this game is a 2d space shooter about moving right and holding down the space bar to shoot. Pretty hard to muff up right? Well apparently not.\n\nThere are no words to describe how awful this game is. Truly one of the worst in my library. To start with, the camera is zoomed in, what feels like, 8 times too far. There is barely any room to move around in. Second, the intro to the game is gawd awful. It is a single, long, drawn out cutscene of some guy talking into a crappy $20 mic, doing his best to try and impersonate a robot. Not only is it excruciatingly boring, but it tells us next to nothing about the actual world itself. Third, this game is ugly. Not just in the sense of, oh well it's an indie game so it's obviously not going to look very good. But ugly in the sense of, WTF am I looking at. Lastly, and most importantly, enemy projectiles are almost impossible to see. I've been killed by what looks like nothing, imeasureable times.\n\nIn the end, this game is not worth even getting for free. It is truly one of the most awful games I've ever had to experience.

This is my only advice as this game's massive overworld is nearly impossible to explore it all, between planets and the Enterprise (which is HUGE) you will need to dedicate your life to 100% complete. Buy this game for yourself and your friends and play together with the separate Multiplayer feature which allows you to break trees with your fists and plant marajuana in order to feed the Dank Snorlax. I hope you all have as much fun with this game as I did.","August 20, 2015","true","0.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","44","4","9","6","1"

I think the gameplay elements need to be a bit more clear, like the swirling blue cloud that starts to chase your ship around... what is it? It'd be cool if hitting a new power-up either reset the timer on your current one (assuming they're the same) or swapped to the new one. I feel that the traps, debuffs basically, are a bit too powerful or unclear. For instance the vertical/horizontal freezes and no shooting, they last far too long in my opinion. The no shooting one especially, that basically ends the game as the screen is swarmed with enemy ships long before it wears off.\n\nThere needs to be a cursor for menu navigation or have mouse movements change what items are selected as with tabbing through clickable things in a window.

I'll probably use some of them as ideas for Space Engineers or my own artwork.\n\nI love most of the backgrounds and in fact I'd have paid a dollar for a game that was simply dodging asteroids with high-res versions of the images used for the backgrounds (total space nut) though I'm not sure how I feel about images that are obviously from other games like seeing the Normandy from Mass Effect.\n\nThe music is kinda nice and if they released a twenty-five or even fifty cent DLC of the soundtrack I'd probably snag that too if the tracks were at least a few minutes long each or all mixed together to make a long-ish track that looped well.\n\nI think the general backlash from many of the commenters could have been avoided if the game had been released as Early Access and therefore obviously a WiP and as it stands right now I think that's the only way this should even be on Steam since it is far from completed (glaring typo on the main screen for instance unless that's supposed to be Star since the game is Stellar 2D, stellar-star... har har?) But that also means that if they plan to do more with it such as general improvements maybe there will be more modes like a zen type mode with relaxing music or a super swarm mode featuring default gameplay but with a bazillion debuffs that last a fraction of a second just to mess with you...\n\n\nOverall I can't sit and play for hours straight and I doubt this game will get more than a few hours of play total but for the price it's well worth it.

I am trying to have breaks so I will finish it eventually (unlike Skyrim, where I was Skyrim'd out).\n\nThe monsters, characters and environments stay true to the Witcher world. You can tell the people who made this game really care about this game and its environment. They are providing free DLC, but you can buy a season pass if you want even more Witcher goodness.\n\nThe fighting is fluid and there are horse races, crafting and collectible card games to add even more variety to a great well thought out game. Shame there are no sex cards this time though ;-)\n\nThe graphics look great even on the lowest settings and each quest feels like a proper adventure, not just fetch some feathers or kill ten wolves because they look scary.

Power ups are also kind of random.\nImpossible to understand voice over.\n\nWorst of all, there's no way to know if the ship is getting hit most of the time (there might be a sound effect for it, but everything else is making so much noise it wouldn't really matter if there was), and the bullets (which are really hard to see) go through you, so it's hard to tell if you dodged it until you look at your health (which seems to lag sometimes).\n\nThere must be a hit-box, obviously, but I have zero idea of how big it is. Asteroids will hit me head on and there won't be any damage, but I'll think I dodged something completely and my health will go down.\n\nPros-\n\nTrading cards\nI paid fifteen cents.\n\nConclusion: If you get it crazy cheap like I did, you can leave it running and it'll eventually pay for itself.

Played it for a few minutes and the first thing I notice is that the typeface (font) used for the title is hard to read. I would recommend that you tone down the effects on it or add a little kerning inbetween the letters to make it more readable.\n\nb. On the main menu would be nice to have some padding from the bottom of the screen. As it is right now there is some  tension with "quit game" button and the bottom of the screen.\n\nc. The right side of the main menu button look like pause buttons, looks like you tried to add some flair to it. I would recommend making the last rectangle a little shorting (width wise).\n\nd. The "Pause Game" menu and the main menu don't really go together. Would recommend using the same type face family with a differnt style to it.\n\n(2) a. Would be nice to be able to skip the starting sequence (when you open the game); I know its only a few seconds but the option would be nice.\n\nb. skipping the the back story would be nice, gets pretty repetitive when you start a new game.\n\nc. description of power ups and power downs would be nice; maybe put it in the "Media". Kinda sucked while playing that I picked up the three orb power and find out it froze me in place.\n\nd. making the ships 50% to 75% smaller, so that it makes it easier or harder (with trying to dodge the fire/power downs). Also would allow to have more ships on screen to try to kill.\n\ne. Effects of the enemy fire is kinda wonky. Kinda hard to determine if its from the enemy or if it the explosion of an enemy.\n\ne. being able to set your own key placement.\n\nf. Game gets kind of repetive. Played a few levels and didn't notice and background change. Maybe a level where you are in a asteroid field and there are turrets on some of the asteroids or even "astroid bombs"; that go off and shoot our smaller asteroids in a wave if they aren't destroyed with in a certain time frame. Flashing red could signify this; once the astroid is pure red it goes off.\n\nIts a pretty decent game, for the price. It just feels that there is so much more that could be put into it. As it is right now I wouldn't recommend.\n","July 31, 2015","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are decent, although sometimes telling what is an incoming projectile and what isn't can be difficult.  Sounds are subpar, and the voiceover in the opening sequence is so poorly recorded and over-modulated as to be almost unintelligible.  The enemy AI is laughable; there is no variation, they all just plod along in a straight line.

To be honest I wasn't entirely aware of what to expect, when I purchased the game it was mostly due to its price tag; however, having bought this for .17 I think I got what I paid for. It was decent, but was fairly choppy, the movement had no animation what so ever, purely the model skirting across the screen. The background of the menu, storyline and loading screen all looked rather outdated; but again as I said I got what I paid for. The gameplay was decent, at times when jacked up on multiple power ups it was incredibly easy; however at other times it appeared to be much harder as the game progressed. There weren't any fixed power ups making the player not get any stronger as the game got harder, causing the player to get swarmed by enemy fire around 'Level 4'. My biggest pet peeve when it comes to this game is the enemy fire isn't represented by an accurate model, the models stretch across the screen 1-3 inches longer than the area that will actually cause damage which thwarts the player from effectively dodging fire. Despite a few outdated aspects and a slightly awkward gameplay, this was a decent reincarnation of the arcade game 'Stellar' and was probably worth the .17 I paid for it (in addition to the typical .99 fixed price); overall a nice mini-game.","March 29","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To be honest I wasn't entirely aware of what to expect, when I purchased the game it was mostly due to its price tag; however, having bought this for .17 I think I got what I paid for. It was decent, but was fairly choppy, the movement had no animation what so ever, purely the model skirting across the screen. The background of the menu, storyline and loading screen all looked rather outdated; but again as I said I got what I paid for. The gameplay was decent, at times when jacked up on multiple power ups it was incredibly easy; however at other times it appeared to be much harder as the game progressed. There weren't any fixed power ups making the player not get any stronger as the game got harder, causing the player to get swarmed by enemy fire around 'Level 4'. My biggest pet peeve when it comes to this game is the enemy fire isn't represented by an accurate model, the models stretch across the screen 1-3 inches longer than the area that will actually cause damage which thwarts the player from effectively dodging fire. Despite a few outdated aspects and a slightly awkward gameplay, this was a decent reincarnation of the arcade game 'Stellar' and was probably worth the .17 I paid for it (in addition to the typical .99 fixed price); overall a nice mini-game.","March 29","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That also shows up the %.\nThere is a useless highscore.\n\nAbout the game.\nYou play as a spaceship.... yay another spaceship game -.-... anyhow this is a really terrible one. It's almost impossible to beat a level because it's super easy to take damage. The bullets from the enemy ships are almost impossible to see or dodge. The only thing what you just see is some dust which is the same color as the background. Not only that, But there are more enemies on the screen and other "Damage dealers" then you can take down or avoid. The music is just a simple piece again, like those other spaceship games. Just some random music from the windows media player. There are powerups which could just ruin ur match.. Like "No shoot" or "Only vertical move" So that you can't shoot or only go to left and right. The game is terrible bad and the only thing what enemies are doing is moving to left..\n\nThe music is just not interesting.\nYou can change the graphical settings only in-game\nEnemies are too much.\nBullets are difficult to impossible to see and dodge.\nYou can't skip intro's/cutscenes\n\n\nOther things.\nDo not get this game.

There is this constant noise that sounds like a neckbeard having an asthma attack and not only do I have no idea what is making that noise, I can't turn it off because the sound options are bugged. But the graphics aren't much better as I highly suspect that this game is another Unity Asset Flip. I swear that one of the bosses was a green polygon that was unfinished. I had to wonder for a second if the game was glitching up or if the developers were just that lazy.\n\nBut that's not the biggest graphical problem. You know how in every other shmup you can clearly see the enemy bullets on screen, and in really good ones, your bullets are layered below the enemy's? That way you can easily dodge while shooting because the two sets of bullets contrast each other. Well, Stellar 2D says "♥♥♥♥ that noise, we're going to have the enemies fire streams of air that often blend in with the background so nobody can know that they're getting hit until they suddenly die.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, there are games on Newgrounds or Kongregate more fleshed out that this game. Just shoot and dodge while getting power-ups, or power-downs that look exactly the same as power-ups. The game makes Space Invaders look complicated and with games like Crimson Clover, Astebreed and the eXceed series on Steam, among other far superior scrolling shmups, Stellar 2D is unnecessary.\n\nThe comparison to Digital Homicide is pretty apt, considering that Stellar 2D, like the atrocious Temper Tantrum, were made to make a quick buck without even trying to innovate or put any effort into making a good game. That's the worst part about Steam's indie glut. There are games like Takedown: Red Sabre that are awful but you can tell that some effort was put in, there are games like Warmode or Unearthed: Trail of Ibn Battuta that are entertaining in their awfulness but Stellar 2D feels like a bad Flash game made during a long weekend, let alone something that deserves to be on the same storefront as Counter-Strike and Skyrim. Don't humor the developers by buying this game, even at 99 cents.","May 29","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
