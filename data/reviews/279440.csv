I expected maybe 45 minutes to an hours worth of gameplay at most. Forge Replay haven't just created an interactive book with a few fancy pictures. They've crammed in an unbelievable amount of content: An in-depth character creation system. A superbly written story. Turn based, quick-time combat. Countless unlockables. A whopping 79 achievements, and so much more! I really hope to see more from these guys.\n\nFor those of you who enjoyed the soundtrack, it's available here (official link) - https://soundcloud.com/93-steps/sets/joe-devers-lone-wolf-original","November 27, 2014","true","5.9"," 119 of 140 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","119","140","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nenjin024/recommended/279440/","nenjin024","~GSW~ JumpyJump","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nenjin024/","219 products in account","TLDR: Lone Wolf game ported from mobile to PC. Probably not going to satisfy those unfamiliar with Lone Wolf, and liking Lone Wolf isn't a guarantee you'll like it either. What should you pay for this if you were to get it? ~$5 to ~$7.\n\nIt's been a real struggle, as a fan of Lone Wolf since grade school, whether to thumbs up or thumbs down this one. Ultimately I give it a thumbs down, based on price, and whether or not I think people would enjoy it. Despite several parts of the game that work, some don't, including the story which is a real problem for a game like this.  In the end, it's a mobile game with mobile limitations and a need to make Lone Wolf "gamier."\n\nMy breakdown~\n\nOVERALL: The game presents well. The UI and Storybook look nice and flavorful, although the UI animations get obnoxious. The graphics and combat animations are nice while not being stellar. The music is good although there's very little of it so you'll be listening to the same tracks for the whole game. The sound effects are easily the weakest part of the game. Little variety to them and they all have little impact. Striking wounds in combat sounds like someone tearing a piece of paper quickly. The brief narration at chapter breaks is awkward as well.\n\nGAME BOOK ADAPATION: It doesn't stay very faithful to the game books in terms of mechanics. While this isn't all bad and they manage to add to game play rather than purely subtract from it, Lone Wolf loses a part of its identity when designed like most modern video games. You define your character at the game start according to whether they're bashy, sneaky or thinky. So right out of the gate you're greeted by what you see in a lot of other games: a strict list of choices guiding gameplay rather than staying open-ended. You pick 4 powers from the usual Kai Powers list, have Vitality, Endurance and Kai Power pools for taking hits, using melee attacks and using Kai Powers and the Sommerswerd.\n\nYou level up based on the story decisions you make (again, Fighty, Sneaky or Thinky are the usual choices you get.) Sometimes your Kai powers offer you other story choices, and these are grouped under one of the three main attributes for experience purposes. You can master 3 different weapons which provides tweaks to their attacks. You do the same for the Sommerswerd. But those are just kinda tacked on. All in all, mechanically, the game was enough to get me to finish but it'll be years before I replay it, if ever.\n\nSecondly the game is very linear, even for a Lone Wolf game, but you can retread a lot of paths you chose not to take initially too. So there it also loses something in translation, where story paths in Lone Wolf are restrictive, and you're always moving forward. The choices you can't go back on in this game don't feel like they carry much weight. I don't feel much compulsion to go back and play as a Strength character, for example, or to find what that one room which mysteriously stopped being a choice was about. There are only a couple places in the game you can't go back to. All this retreading also becomes a problem for resources, because you can farm random encounters for the loot drops, just like most traditional video games. So where in the game books scarcity is a big part of your decision making, LW HD Remastered is your standard potion guzzling, resource hoarding affair. On normal you have to be screwing up pretty badly not be drowning in health potions, extra ammo and money. Making LW mechanically like other games robbed it of some urgency and danger.\n\nCOMBAT - Being that this is a mobile game, combat comes down to three things: decision making on what ability to use or attack to launch, luck and Quick Time Events. This wouldn't be so bad, as combat early on is actually pretty challenging and the wrong choice at the wrong time will screw you, so these choices feel important. But there's two problems: 1) somewhere midgame, you start getting very overpowered and combat loses its teeth and 2) there is way, way too much combat. Playing through you can sense where combat is thrown in as filler often, as the text regularly goes into "And then a bunch of Giaks and Drakkarim burst on the scene." Where there might be interesting choices to make, puzzles to challenge your mind or just variety, combat is the substitue for all those things in LW HD. Dever had some great brain buster puzzles in the game books, but here the puzzles are a 3d cube you mess with to fit into a lock, and boss fights. A final gripe is that there are very few enemy types (for a PC game), so you'll be fighting the same couple of monsters with some reskinning and difficulty tweaks for most of the game. I wouldn't be so hard on combat if they'd used it more sparingly, but as it is the bulk of my 16 hours in game was spent doing that.\n\nSTORY - As a long time Lone Wolf fan this is hard to say, but this is easily the weakest Lone Wolf story Dever has written.  It's kind of a drastic change from the usual LW story. Set sometime after Book 2 but before Book 10, LW is dealing with local problems in Sommerlund instead of fighting the war against the Darklords, since this is an interlude in the Magnakai quest. So compared to the usual LW story you:\n-Fight your way through almost all problems.\n-Don't really go anywhere other than your own backyard.\n-Aren't being constantly hunted, despite the text trying to make you feel you are.\n-Aren't being betrayed, despite the text raising the question often.\n-Aren't adventuring in a land filled with scumbags and traitors and spies.\n-Get motivations from the story to make you feel the pressure and the direness of the situation, except none of them work.\n-Get the least likeable character Lone Wolf has ever traveled with, who is annoying, the primary driver of the plot and is a bit of a Mary Sue. Do you enjoy reading about someone who disrespects your character, ignores all your advice, rarely thanks you for your constant sacrifices, disobeys all your strictures and basically without who the story almost wouldn't have a point? Well, saddle up! The narration is almost painfully selfaware of all this.\n\nI want to like the story, but it's just too weak and lacks the interesting and quality adventuring that made the Lone Wolf game books so good.  A lot of space is given over to people in the story, fleshing out characters whereas the LW books were all about YOU DOING STUFF. The game is recognizable as LW because of the setting, names and game book art (which tries to faithfully emulate Gary Chalk's work), not because of how it handles itself. Even the story choices you get to make seem uninspired for Dever, which are less about how you as a Kai get ♥♥♥♥ done, and more about how whatever you do inevtiably ends up in combat. Wrong choices feel even more hard coded, since QTEs replaced the game books dice rolls and are hard to fail. You're left with the choices that end up making combat easier or harder in some way. Combined with the linearity, and the story itself and how it's executed is probably one of the game's biggest disappointments.\n\nDURATION: I managed to get nearly 16 hours of it by milking the experience as long as I could. So probably 8 to 10  hours for most players. I got my money's worth there.\n\nSo for Lone Wolf fans, maybe this is worth a look. It's undeniably Dever but it's just not that interesting of a story. I ended up liking the visuals and restylization of Lone Wolf (although those side burns look ridiculous) but after 10 hours it too became repetitive.\n\nGet this if you want to show your support for Dever and Lone Wolf, or because you really crave a new Lone Wolf experience. Just don't expect the same kind of rose-tinted enjoyment because it may not deliver.\n\nTo everyone else....it's a mobile game ported to the PC that will probably underwhelm you and in my opinion, isn't representative of the quality that made the Lone Wolf books something people would make a game of.","December 6, 2014","false","16.1"," 141 of 177 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","141","177","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/recommended/279440/","tgr1","Kelly Osbourne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/","434 products in account","It may surprise some people to learn that, before playing Joe Dever’s Lone Wolf HD Remastered, I hadn’t heard of the series or the author. A quick Google revealed that Joe began writing the Lone Wolf books back in the late 80s’, and the character has also made appearances in videogames and gamebooks – the novels alone have sold over 9 million copies!  Lone Wolf HD casts you as the titular character,  the mysterious Liege Lord of Sommerlund. A ruler of his people, who has sworn to protect them from any threat, no matter how big. But don’t be fooled by this description or the screenshots floating around the internet, Lone Wolf HD is a text-heavy gamebook first and foremost, and a turn-based RPG second.\n\nYou start off by customising the Lone Wolf to your liking, choosing his skills and traits which you’ll be able to use during the game to overcome difficult situations. The game quickly launches into its lore, telling of a snowy, mountainous land reminiscent of games like Skyrim.\n\nThe village of Rockstarn has been set ablaze, her people murdered and their belongings stolen. You soon discover that a foul horde of Giaks is responsible for this heinous crime. With your sword in hand you set about thinning out their numbers, whilst looking for survivors and clues as to why this has happened. These sequences take two forms: turn based combat, and choice-driven story. As you progress through the game, you will be presented with meaningful choices, and how you approach them can benefit you or come back to haunt you later in your quest. Every dilemma gives you a number of choices, each relevant to a particular skill you may or may not have mastered. While some situations call for a more direct approach, others may require tact on your part, to achieve the desired results.\n\nThe Lone Wolf’s story is of epic proportions, and you’ll travel across Sommerlund to take the fight to Giak hordes and their masters. Your map is marked with various locations and merchants where you can stock up on provisions. Exploring each location furthers the story and takes you deeper into your quest to find out why the people of Rockstarn have been murdered. The land is overrun with enemies though, and you’ll have to lay waste to them to protect your people.\n\nCombat is turn-based and you must complete your attacks within a time limit, after which the enemy will begin their assault. You’ll go up against a variety of different beasts during your quest, ranging from bog-standard Giaks to their superiors, the formidable Drakkarim, and the terrifying Red Fang. Lone Wolf has a number of powerful attacks in his arsenal to overcome his foe, as well as various arms and side arms. You’ll also be able to call upon your Kai power, a kind of mental ability that only few have a mastery of, to launch debilitating psychological attacks. The options available to you are also linked directly to the skills you chose during the game’s opening, so it is worth keeping that in mind when choosing your skills. Combat is quick, fluid and fun, but it’s a shame that some special moves require quick cursor rotations or directional flicks. Undoubtedly, this would have been responsive and intuitive in the iOS version of the game, but on PC it feels a little bit clunky and un-optimised. That’s not to say it spoils the combat, but the thought that your cursor movements might not have been accurate enough is always there. While the combat is engaging it serves merely to break up long sections of the book and, ultimately, you’ll be anxious to get back to reading it.\n\nAnd what a book it is. Mr Dever’s mastery of his craft is immediately apparent, as he weaves a complex but approachable tale filled with interesting characters and locations. His masterful descriptions created images so rich in my minds-eye that I could almost feel the heat, and smell the acrid smoke, of Rockstarn as it burned to the ground. You will spend most of your time reading, so be aware that the only GPU getting a workout won’t be inside your computer, it’s inside your head. It’s at this point that I should disclose that I am not much of a reader, but found Joe Dever’s Lone Wolf HD Remastered to be an addictive and gripping tale. I’d encourage anyone with even a passing interest in fantasy books to give The Lone Wolf some of their time.\n\nAs an iOS port, I wasn’t expecting much from the game graphically, and, truth be told, it’s a bit of a mixed bag. While the menus, book and illustrations are all rendered nicely, the 3D combat sections do suffer from some graphical disparity. The Lone Wolf and his enemies all feature detailed animations and textures, but the surroundings they’ll be fighting in are low-resolution and low-poly. Luckily, these jarring differences are offset by how brief combat tends to be. The game’s score can’t be faulted though, and while there’s only a handful of unique tracks they run from rousing to melancholic, and are played at suitable intervals – it’s also included in your download for your listening pleasure!\n\nWhilst it does have its drawbacks, Joe Dever’s Lone Wolf HD Remastered is a stunning example of the gamebook genre, brought to life on PC. Featuring an engrossing mix of story and turn-based combat, it’s sure to appeal to people with an appreciation of a deep lore. Completionists will also get bang for their buck, with the choice-driven narrative lending itself well to replayability. For the Sommerlund and the Kai, you must buy this game!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nReview code provided by publisher.

These books were my first introduction real RPGs.  So when I tripped over this during the Thanksgiving Sale, you can imagine my excitement.\n\nFriends and fans of the old-fashioned adventure books, it does not dissapoint.\n\nThe game basically plays like an alternate version/continuation of the Lone Wolf adventure book series.  While a newcomer to the series might feel a touch lost, the opening sums things up beautifully and character creation is a breeze.  Everything is so clear and concise.  Most importantly though, *your choices actually matter*!\n\nMuch like the original books, every decision you make reverberates through your adventure.  I'm only starting the second chapter, but I am thouroughly hooked, weighing each choice carefully before I make it.  Especially when said choices can impact the combat encounters.\n\nOh yes, the combat.  If you're a fan of Paper Mario or South Park: Stick of Truth, this should feel rather familiar.  Select target, choose an attack, maybe do a quick-time event for more damage.  All turn-based, pretty standard stuff (though the graphics are absolutely GORGEOUS!).  But the biggest draw to combat is how it ties to your choices leading up to it!\n\nYou spot a group of enemies.  Do you sneak up on them?  Charge in and try to catch them off-guard?  Spend some of your limited supernatural power to try and sneak past them?  Whatever choice you makes carries into the combat, rendering enemies weaker or even avoiding combat all together if you choose well, or possibly giving them a chance to strike first if you fail at your attempt.  And just like in the books, while combat can be exciting, you feel the limit of your health and items.  The game feels very rewarding when the right choice leads to an easier fight.\n\nI cannot stress this enough:  If you ever liked the Lone Wolf books, get this game.  If you're a fan of RPGs in general and you've never heard of the Lone Wolf books, go read about them on TVTropes or something and then *GET THIS GAME.*  You're not just buying an immersive game, you're paying homage to a piece of Roleplaying history.","November 27, 2014","true","8.5"," 63 of 73 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","63","73","0","0"

ECT-ECT (i think you get what i mean).\nAny desicion you make will effect the outcome and either bolster your chance's or help to see you meeting an untimely end,and this element not only effect's combat but is also pivotal to the story as well because when you do make a decision you have to live with it as the game auto save's so make sure you choose to do the right thing (IS THERE A RIGHT THING IN THIS GAME????????)\n\nThe following is a gameplay video which shows the sort of things you will be doing in game -\n\nJoe Dever's Lone Wolf HD Remastered Gameplay(PC ...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVV9qep-fUY\n\nThe graphic's in game range from the static variety when your reading (which serve as a background whilst you are reading) to some really good graphic's when your fighting and solving puzzle's with the Shianti cube or picking lock's.\nAnd it's whilst fighting the horde that the graphic's shine as you really want to see that final killing blow on that Vordak Undertaker that's been causing you problem's for the last hour AARRGGHHHHHHHH.\nEvery encounter will play out different'ly and the animation for the horde is different enough that they all have their own animation's for attack pattern's and also (which is the best point) their own death scene's (at your hand's) as they all die in various way's.\nSome animation's do repeat themselves but to be honest none of them outstay their welcome and each and every victory is as satisfying as the last (especially when you take down that Gourgaz thats been beating you senseless for the last hour "GO AWAY YOU BIG LIZARD").\nThe soundtrack that accompanies the game can only be desribed as epic and really does help make the game feel like the adventure that it is and should be,and even whilst reading it never annoy's to the point where you want to switch it of.\nActually i for one found the soundtrack to be a welcome addition and it wouldent feel out of place in any RPG game or Fantasy movie,and as is mostly the case in a game like this it just wouldent be the same without it.\nThe story really does do justice to the source material and fit's into the cannon perfectly,and if like me your a fan then you will appriciate it no end and you will both an once enjoy the familiar in the story and also the new that's been added as well.Will you need to have previous experience with this style of game and even know the story to enjoy it ????????\nWell having played the game and reached its conclusion and being that i am such a fan i would say yes and no to that statement.\nNow i would say no as the story is written so well that it just pull's you in and at no point's does it loose anyone who is'nt familiar with its background or the character's,and it both introduces them and the history of Lone Wolf's world with a confident flair and ease that is there for all to see.\nAnd i would say yes as at the same time if you've come to the game with knowledge of what's going on before the game takes place,then you will get even more out of your time with it than if you hadent,and if your like me you will love to see the Sommerswerd raised and used to crush the Darkland horde's (especially the Vordaks-you undead pains in the AR__,NOW-NOW calm down its just a game)\nNow this is not the first game to have been based on the Lone Wolf series of book's and there have been other's but i remember one that i really did want to play but sadly it never did get a release date and actually it ended up being canned.Here is a trailer for the game that sadly never was.\n\nGameplay from a cancelled lone wolf game -\n\nLone Wolf:Flight from the Dark Game Developers SF 2008 ...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caJr7psJx-Y\n\nOkay now all's said and done would you like to play this game reading and making choices and fighting the Darkland horde's,and will you get anything out of it ??????\nWell read and answer the following three question's and decide for yourself -\n\n1 - Am i the sort of person who like's a fantasy tale full of foul creature's and dark magic?????\n\n2 - Do i like playing and reading through a visual novel style game (even with all it's enhancement's over other's of its type)?????\n\n3 -

The gameplay certainly is different from what one may be used to if one has played the original gamebooks. I was surprised at first, but eventually find that this is quite a refreshing way to explore the world of Lone Wolf.\n\nArtwork is absolutely gorgeous! Loved seeing Lone Wolf actually portrayed in his full glory for the first time ever, albeit still in his early years as a Kai Lord. The transition from paper to 3D and back is a great touch. Battle backgrounds are varied according the player's location when attacked.\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty good as well, well suited for the environment and events. They add to the mystique, danger, sorrow of whichever fortunate, or unfortunate event that occurred in the game world.\n\nBattles require players to understand the mechanism and adapt to something completely different from the gamebooks. It also may seem repetitive, but personally, I feel that it's unavoidable for a game of this caliber. The freedom of movement and random battles aim to help the player to get used to fighting a certain enemy, gain items and gold, as well as provide the player with the ability to have some control over moving in an area. It allows the player to break free from the typical gamebook linearity where they must perform certain XYZ actions at a specific time, and no other (i.e. purchase from merchants. or training skills).\n\nA lot of balancing changes have been made to the battle system since it was first released. I find it quite well balanced compared to initial release. Some battle elements appear to be random, unfair and hard, but if one played the original gamebooks properly (i.e. without cheating), one may find themselves on the verge of death or dying quite often as well.\n\nNot a fan of QTEs, but I feel that this game has it done right for the general user. They are doable as long as the player remembers what QTE action is required for which combat skill. The QTEs are fixed for almost every battle action, and events (as long as you can memorize the QTEs every event in the game). The controls are intuitive for the mouse, and does not impose strict directional movements on the player (i.e. the swipe does not have to be a definite 45 degree semi-circular movement to be executed).\n\nStatistics can rise depending on the actions the player decides to take during an event. Repeated usage of weapon skills will eventually lead to an additional bonus for that particular skill. Crafting to improve weapons, armours and certain items are a welcome surprise. (I only miss my Sommersack from the iOS). There are some puzzles in the game to give variety, but not that much that it takes too much from the gameplay.\n\nThis is certainly an interesting way to breath life into a gamebook, what with many other companies already creating digital gamebooks that adhere more or less to the standards of a paperback (i.e. dice-rolling, turn to page ###).\n\nSure, it's not perfect (seriously, what is?), but a truly excellent work from both the original creator of Lone Wolf, and the developer of this game.","May 21, 2015","true","4.6"," 32 of 33 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","32","33","0","0"

You actually feel as if you are becoming physically and mentally more skillful the more you play. Every stage of the game works on choices and consequences but you never feel as if you are bogged down or distracted by the medium itself. All the dice rolls etc. are handled and masked by the software in such a way that you realise what is going on but the sytem never intrudes on your immersion. It's difficult to imagine how a game of this nature could have been accomplished in a way to make it any better than it actually is. Equipment can be improved through crafting and is customisable in such a way that the new benefits are clearly understood and actively felt. I want more like this and as long as you can keep in mind that it IS a conversion of a set system you should love it.

When I first saw the android release of this game I jumped on it to add it to my collection and found it didn't play up to its potential on my android tablet. Then all of a sudden, I see this... beautiful gem released on the PC. It's slick, smooth, beautiful, atmospheric and worth every bit I paid for it. Combat can be hectic, but you get used to it after awhile. Music is haunting. The storytelling is superb. The illustrations and 3d art are impressive. Awesomeness rolled up into a nice neat package.\n\nThis game did a wonderful job of revitalizing my love for this series and hope you can get a glimpse into this fascinating world. Outside of the game, you can continue the journeys of Lone Wolf by visiting: http://www.projectaon.org/  and downloading the gamebooks in various forms, extra material, etc. (for FREE, thanks to the generosity of Joe Dever and the hard work of the wonderful folks on the AON Project).\n\nFor Sommerlund!

Its like an interactive book with multiple tools to get the job done with slight variation to how the game unfolds.\n\nThe narative is stylish and done close to how the upcoming 'Hand of Fate' is done, but is somewhat different. Its fancy, rich in details and vivid, making it really easy to picture the events unfolding. Seriously its like an ok fantasy book.\n\nNow the problems with the game are shallow crafting and loot systems, repetitive combat, customisation and soundtrack.\n\nThe combat is semi turn based and is somewhat confusing for the 1st 3-6 minutes, then after a few hours of slaying monsters it gets rather repetitve and boring also easy *if you have chosen the perks right* or are willing to use potions.\nCrafting system exists but other then the 'inventory increase' the changes the crafted gear brings are minimal. The 'various weapons' are not so various at all its the same 3 weapons with slightly different stats and sometimes a different model. Now the animations are done well *even the comical faces of enemies during the mana restoration finishers* and the gameplay is on the point fluid, but with little variation to it it eventually will get dull no matter what. Too many battles with too little variation.\n\nSoundtrack was distracting and filled with disturbing background noises of a muted phone under a pillow a few meters away.\n\nOverall its a solid game, definite few hours of fun, unless  you are impartial to the storytelling narrative, which this game does great.\n\nOverall easy 6-7/10.

Keeping in mind that I have yet to pass five or so hours in game yet and this is based only on the first chapter, my biggest problem is this.\n\nThere is so.  Much.  RNG.\n\nRestating, there is nothing wrong with Random Number Generator-based anything.  Every game relies on RNG.  Sometimes your attack goes through, sometimes it's blocked, sometimes it's parried, sometimes you get lucky, sometimes not.  The problem with Lone Wolf is how shatteringly screwed you can be by the RNG, and there is not a single thing you can do about it.\n\nThe fighting consists of two phases for you; an attack phase and a rest phase.  During your attack phase, a timer ticks down how long you have to make your attacks, drink your potions, etc.  You can do multiple things per turn, until you eat up all your END (physical actions), MANA (magic actions) or run out of time.  Your END recovers very slowly during your attack phase and very quickly during your rest phase, with your MANA barely recovering at all until you kill an enemy.  However, while YOU cannot attack in your rest phase, enemies can attack ALL THE TIME, operating on their own (hidden) attack and rest phases.  You can and will be interupted while you go to select an attack by an enemy launching his attack first, preventing you from acting on a strategy or idea.\n\nRNG as I already stated is beyond intolerable at times.  The very first attack launched against you, you might dodge.  Or  it can stun you, you lose your turn, and are unable to act while enemies deal 1500 damage to you (very realistic damage, considering even within the first 3-4 battles they start throwing 3 enemies at a time at you).  Or you might dodge all these attacks and then launch your own POWERFUL attack on an enemy.  He might take the hit and lose 50% of his health, or he might counter it, take 10% damage, and you have just wasted 50% of your END, better luck next time.\n\nThe point of this is that it boils down to the right set of circumstances happening to let you succeed.  Being stunned in turn 1 can sometimes be an instant game-over, as you lose your turn and are reduced to nearly no HP and struggling to recover.  5 minutes into the fight, you might be selecting your sword to kill an enemy when he swigs back a potion (Even basic enemies have potions, by the way, hope you don't mind your fodder healing themselves), and he now has more HP than you can dish out, preventing you from killing him, preventing you from replenishing your mana, preventing you from healing the next round, meaning you died.\n\nAnd this is all topped off with the fact that you can restart every battle from the beginning.  So what happens?\n\nYou restart.  A lot.\n\nNot even from dying, either.  Enemy dealt a shattering crit on their first move?  Restart, this time you parry it.  Enemy stunned you at the wrong time?  Restart, hope that doesn't happen this time.  I have had cases where I have restarted certain fights upwards of 15-20 times until the RNG simply decided it was a good time to let me win, and the enemies didn't pull any shenanigans and my attacks went off without a hitch.\n\nBottom line of all this: The game is pretty and sounds nice, fantastic.  But the gameplay itself suffers horrendously not because of actual mechanics, but because all the behind-the-scenes calculations rely entirely on a very erratic RNG system that can leave you decimating your enemies easily or getting royally screwed over on your very first turn.  If you buy this game, be prepared to accept that a great deal of your time will involve slamming that ESC key, restarting the battle, and just praying that RNGesus is kind to you this time.","December 13, 2014","false","7.2"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","20","29","0","1"

You get about 30 seconds to act and then 30 seconds to sit there like a knob but enemies can attack you at any time as long as you arent in a menu. If you want to do just about anything in combat you will need to succeed in a quick time event. There are several to try and remember and no way to practice outside of combat so good luck getting everything straight! Combat is always by yourself and mostly the same enemies over and over again. If you fight a boss then you will see them re-apear constantly in the next act as a regular enemy. If you fail you can try again but you cant really back track so if you find yourself in a very difficult fight then you will have to reload a save.\n\nOutside of combat the game takes place via reading in a book. The writing is very dry and whenever there is conversation with another charecter it gets really awkward. A couple times the book literally said "you fire your ranged weapon" and it seems lazy that they wouldnt program which weapon I had as there were only two choices for that slot at the time. There are desicions to make and more quick time events to go along with them but it feels like there is largerly one path. There are more open areas as you go where you can have optional encounters but there dosent seem to be anything that greatly changes the story. Which is disapointing as there were several paths you could take in the original books that would change your outcome.\n\nCharecter creation was nice. Instead of picking from a list of skills you are given a series of choices. Choices that you make during the story will change how you level up, rush into combat and you get more HP while using your kai abilities will give you more magic.\n\nThe art is really pretty and there are 2D pictures that have a bit of animation to them that are very nice. THe only complaint I had graphics wise was that Lone Wolf himself looks completly rediculous at all times. I suppose he is trying to come across as a badass but looks more like an emo poser.\n\nI would say this game is a major disapointment. Most of the time I feel like the ideas presented where trying to be good, but come across as messy and jumbled together instead of part of a collective whole. I would recommend picking up the old lone wolf books if you can find them and stay far away from this mess.","October 4, 2015","false","4.2"," 61 of 105 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","61","105","3","3"

I paid $7.49 for this game, and it was beyond worth it. I've played just under thirty minutes. This game feels great. You get to create a customized character in minutes, those choices immediately affect the story you are reading and the combat you will face. The story events are between old school text based adventures and quick time events. It blends your decisions with your actions beautifully. The turn based combat doesn't let you walk away. You have limited time and resources to take actions, so you need to make snap decisions. To be effective you need to stay calm and focused. This makes the combat thrilling, and did I mention this game looks pretty too. The way they blend art from the book into the combat sequences is stunning. The graphics aren't what you would see on a next gen console, but they look good. As far as animation is concerned, I have to say they nailed it. From throwing knives to having your chest slashed open, the models move fluidly. I definitely recommend picking Lone Wolf up if you have $10 to spare.\n\nEdit: Now that I have almost ten hours under my belt, I would like to expand this review a little bit. I started another character because I didn't see how it was possible to survive without certain skills. Turns out I was wrong. You can definitely take whatever starting skills you are interested in trying. Sometimes enemies will wreck your day. When it happens, you may not even get to defend yourself because it is absolutely possible to become stun locked. It isn't likely, and because the game uses a random element, it is also completely possible for you to dodge every attack in a fight. You will probably die a couple of times during a fight that you are prepared for due to bad luck. It makes it far more rewarding when you try again and slaughter your enemies. If you really get stuck, the game even has the option to drop the difficulty a step when you retry. I should also talk about replay value after making a second character. It's okay. If you choose different skills at the beginning of the game, and you try taking another path through each of the obstacles in the game, then it isn't too repetitive. Many of the fights will be the same or nearly the same unless you had the option to avoid one completely. When you know what you are doing, you can definitely work through the fights faster, and it feels like you are accomplishing something rather than grinding because the story actually moves as you cut down your enemies. I can't say how long a run through this campaign should take. I just set the game on hard, turned off hints, and charged into the fray.","May 19, 2015","true","58.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

My intent in doing so is to share my view, with my fellow gamers, that this game deserves to be played and enjoyed.\n\nWhen I saw Lone Wolf on the main page I immediately had a flashback of the books that I used to read/play when I was a kid. This being said, I was prudent before buying because the last thing I wanted was to experience a disapointment that would taint my memory of such a great experience I had playing these books. I was especially worried about the Quick Time Events (QTEs), as I really hate those in a game (QTEs usually means a shortcut to me, one that the developper took instead of developping a combat system for example) This being said, I didnt want this game to be a hack/slash either. So I took a chance after having read the positive reviews.\n\nThe game is essentially split in two parts: Reading the story and making choices, based on your stats and character's specifics, and combat/action events.\n\nThe story itself is true to the Lone Wolf books. Well written, engaging, and detailled enough so that you can perceive or visualize the envrionement in which you evolve. There are also pretty cool pictures once in a while. The choices you make in the story determines where you go, who joins or assist you, what loot you may get, and how you engage in fights.\n\nThe combat and action events takes you out of the story format and brings you into a live event where you see yourself fighting enemies. The combat is similar to a turn based like Final Fantasy (time bar until it is your turn). When it is your turn, you have a certain time to execute as many actions as you want/can based on your endurance and energy points. It is here that you need to be smart to efficiently determine when and how you will play certain moves and how you will combine them to maximize their efficiency.\n\nThe enemies are hard but not unfair. If you die, it is because you should probably have spent that endurance on a defensive move rather than that other move. Some people say QTEs are unfair in combat, because, yes, sometime if you miss one, it results in the enemy landing a more heavy hit. I personally see this as a test of your reflex (which evidently you would have to show in combat or any combat game) The QTEs becomes rather easy after a while anyway. I currently play on normal and find the difficulty just right.\n\nThe character developments is also more complex than I originally thought. It seems your stats raises based on what choices you make during certain acts. For example, if you make a choice that would result on a action based on your dexterity, it will result in a better chance for you to increase your dexterity at the end of the act. Also, the more you use certain skills, the more these will level up, granting you more bonuses in those skills.\n\nYou can also collect items to forge and level up your equipment. It is not a deep item crafting system, but it keeps you on your toes to manage your item and money. The bonuses to upgrading your equipment are essential.\n\nOverall, great engaging story, good enough fighting system for a game based on books, great music (really). I will replay many times to try out different skills combination.\n\n\n\n\n\n","December 7, 2014","true","28.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

If not I highly recommend you engage in one of the best Choose your Own Adventure series of all time.  This game is based on one of my favorite fantasy worlds of all time.  And I say that without attempting to establish a bias.  Without lying, I am a total fan of the books and have wanted the IOS copy of this game for some time.  I just never had a phone that could run it.  That being said, I jumped on this as soon as it was available.  So was it worth it?\n\nThus far, the issues that people may have with this game, is the fact that you are essentially, reading a modernized version of one of the choose your own adventure books.  There is no real vocal nararation outside of the introduction to each chapter.  Beyond that, you the player will be reading the book, and interacting with all the choices and game mechanics in a sort of quick time event laden skill test.  Now let me start by saying I hate quick time events.  I hate them.  But in this case, given the IOS port nature of the game, they are a tolerable evil, that still works with the game.\n\nI have not played the game to date on any difficulty below the hardest... and in doing so, I have found that I literally have to budget a strategy in fights down the the precise second of battle where I need to drink a potion.  Unfortunately, I have had a couple of moments where the games RNG has decided that I would not even get to take a turn as soon as battle starts before the enemy slaughters me with no quarter.  There is a heavy element of RNG, so I am not entirely keen on the idea of that being the only real difficulty.\n\nThere is a lack of music variety, but what you get is good quality stuff.  The sound effects are also not ear sores.  The game also seems to come into a length of around two and a half to three hours per Act, with four Acts to complete the whole game.  That is a base estimate, it can easily be done faster, and again, I am on the hardest difficulty, so I am certain the game can be cleared much faster on the easier stuff.\n\nAll and all this is a completely solid IOS port, fully playable with virtually no gameplay related issues, except for how the touch spots work.  The example is during combat, you can turn the combat, and the "touch spots" where you have to clic k to bring up your menus move with the joints they are attached too.  So lone wolf's sword has a touch spot half way on the blade.  As the sword moves, so does the touch spot, and if you rotate the camera to certain angles, the touch spot can end up overlapping other touch spots.  Not the best system, but it is at least functional, and tolerable without any really devistating moments where it screwed me out of a victory.\n\nI like this game, I find it worth the price of admission considering as a choose your own adventure, there are multiple possible routes through the game that can give alternating storylines.  Its interesting, but admitantly, might not be for everyone since you are literally reading a choose your own adventure novel.  Check it out, and if you are curious about where it comes from, check this link out: http://www.projectaon.org/en/Main/Books  This is the site where you can play the entire book series leading up to the events of the game.\n\nSub note, you don't need to have read the books to enjoy the game.  It just helps :D","December 3, 2014","true","22.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

For the sale price I paid, I'm ok with what I was given. I admire the publisher for introducing a fresh type of game such as this.  But I still can't recommend it. First of all, the challenges and enemies becomes very repetitive and the story started to be boring in the middle part. It felt forced and uninspired at times. The main thing I did like is the nice artwork. I wish they presented more variety with the adventures, challenges, and enemies. The reason I had to play this game is because of the books I read when I was a kid. Playing the game gave a totally a different experience.

I recently saw this game on sale and figured, "Why not give this game a try" and the decision I made to purchase this game will not be one I regret anytime soon. From the start of the game, the immersive experience attached itself to me in a way that made me feel as if I was about to fulfill some form of destiny. The decisions you mkae in this game trully effect the outcome of your path. I trully feel as if the character is one with a portion of myself that may have been lost in a past life. The options that are presented during the times int he game where you must take action, are relevant and properly introduced. For example, in the first chapter you come face to face with your first obstacle which is an avalanche. The options for dealing with this obstacle pertained to my character and I was immediately able to put my character attributes/skills to use. In my case, my character has the ability to communicate with animals, so my first instinct was to call upon nature to help me deal with this situation. I won't spoil the event with details but I must say, that the story preceding my choice was well thought out and very descriptive. Later on in the game, my new found animal companions made yet another appearance in a way that seemed like I had a symbiotic relationship with these digital creatures.\n\nThe story is so compelling that it drives the player to move forward with playing just to get that next pinch of combat, intel or just to read one more page before having to call it a day.\n\nI will be playing this game on every lunchbreak I get during work this holiday season. I might even lose some weight from not eating all that fast food. This relationship could turn out to be a major gamechanger for how I view/critic future games.\n\nOverall, here are the ratings I came up with thus far:\nGraphics(during combat): 9/10\nSoundtrack: 10/10\nCombat: 9/10\nVisuals(in book): 10/10\nStory: 10/10\nCustomization: 10/10\nAi Challenge: 9/10\nReplayability: 10/10\n\nBuy it, play it, enjoy it, play it again.

The game plays mostly like the books it is based on, exept the adaptation allows better tracking of stats and the various choices you make during gameplay. The game carry a good atmosphere and story, given that the main visual outside of combat is text based, we feels everything the character goes through. While the way the story is portrayed may not speak to everyone, the combat aspect is engaging, there are numerous contextual QTE to most action, sometimes while using skills outside of combat, and reall keeps the user invested in the fight. Combat is turn based, but your turn only last as long as one of your stats allow, and enemies attack as soon they can which may also be while 'your turn' plays out. On this side the combat require a bit more finesse and quick thinking than average for an RPG.\nI seriously cannot really speak of a bad aspect of this game, none come to mind. Every skills are balanced and mostly as useful outside of combat or in combat, some may be redundant at times while in the next instance you're glad to have the only skill which can help you. For the price which is not very demanding considering what we've seen in the past, this game is well worth the money and time.\n\nHave fun and play hard!\n\nP.S.

Yes? Then you'll love this game. If not, I can't recommend it to you. As a long time Lone Wolf fan, I was eager to see what was on offer. Here's the good, bad and really bad.\n1) The Good: The artwork. It's a really lovely looking game ... and that's it. There's not really much of a story so far. The experience is much like reading a graphic novel in an uncomfortable chair that has a bit of wire sticking out and poking your back.\n2) The Bad: (i) Not really any instructions. Sometimes, the first time you do something, it will pop-up a tip advising you of a few details but I can't seem to find a way to get those tips back. And there's no instruction manual.  (ii) Not really a story so far (to be fair - the books didn't either, usually just along the lines of "go to the capitol and warn the king").  (iii) Every section is a fight, some sections more than one. You must take the Kai discipline of Healing. Every single action in the game is simple a progression to the next fight. It gets dull, fast.\n3) (a) It's all QTEs - and I have no idea what the contact point for half the QTEs are. Some of them seem really easy and almost impossible to fail, while there is another that I have never succeeded in hitting despite being absolutely certain that I did. (b) Sadly most people probably won't read this far but THE LOCKPICKING. It makes me weep. It's really that bad. There is no contact point to tell you when you have hit the sweet spot. The picks break instantly. When they break, your pick is set back to the original position, meaning you have to start from scratch. I had 12 lockpicks. I broke all 12 - on one lock! If you are presented with any other option than using a lockpick, please, for the sake of your sanity, take it!\nThank you for reading.","January 27, 2015","false","19.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game tries to stretch itself into too many things, and fails to make any one part good, nothing in this game stands out to make it a note worthy game. I know it has a following already due to the books, but if this game was developed without the previous backing of the books it would not have been recieved nearly as well as it has. The graphics are sloppy, the turn based combat isnt bloody turn based as the enemys can attack you while its your turn, the puzzles arent really puzzles as the chance of you completing them in the miniscule time it gives you is next to impossible, and the fact that during a combat sequence you can think you're down to your last enemy, you beat the hard "boss" and have nearly killed his last minion, when suddenly out of no where another big bad boss walks onto the scene, with 4000 health and calls his buddies along while you have no stamina no health and no kai, leaving the winning of the combat down to trial and error mixed with sheer luck on being able to dodge an attack.

The PC version is a terrible port compared to the awesomeness of the mobile game. I actually bought it on mobile after buying the PC version because it looked so great, but on PC it isnt very fun. So I wanted to give it a second chance, and boy I'm glad I did. Its a *great* mobile game, one of my absolute favorite mobile games next to Tales of Illyria. PC, not so much (actually not at all)\n\nAt least for me, the touchscreen events were almost impossible using a mouse, where on Android they are awesome. It seems that when ported, the devs did nothing to make the quicktime events more mouse friendly. Even on mobile you mess up on occasion, as there isnt much time to do the events. But what becomes fun on a touchscreen is just annoying on a mouse. They expect you to be able to do the same quick tap-drag-circle etc events with the exact same speed and accuracy  with a mouse on PC as with your finger or stylus on a tablet. In short, its frustratingly difficult and ruins the game.\n\nYes, I recommend it on mobile, but a big NO for the PC. Oh, and did I mention its $12.99 on google play instead of $14.99? Get it there, don't waste your time with this terrible PC port.","March 22, 2015","false","0.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

It doesn't work, though.\n\nFor a game relying greatly on its writing, I'm sad to say this is quite unbearable to read; incredibly black and white story right off the bat.\nThey say you can tell a bad fantasy by how many made-up words the author uses per page.\nLone Wolf has lots of them.\nNow, that alone wouldn't necessarily signify anything, but they all stand for things we have seen a dozen times already, and while certain authors had managed to draw a fine, creative, thought-provoking stories even using the "typical cast", Lone Wolf doesn't appear to be even trying.\n\nIt's fantasy for the sake of being a fantasy.\n\nForgivable with games that use the story just as a background to their gameplay, but here, the story IS the gameplay.\n\nTl;dr:   If you are a Lone Wolf fan and the books have a place in your heart, revisiting the old world you knew like this must be amazing. I know I'd love to be able to live through some of my favourite books like this.\nBut if you, perhaps, consider buying this game because you enjoy a good read and a good game and Lone Wolf appears to you as a meeting of the two, I would advice you not to do so and instead look somewhere else.","August 3, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Obviously it can change, but I figured I'd do a first-impressions review because this game strikes me as a journey-not-the-destination type of game. I made this review short because this game is very straight forward and there's nothing special to talk about.\n\nOh boy, this is one flawed gem of a game. What's that? I'm recommending it? Yeah, a game can even be severely flawed and still worth a shot. So, this game is a video-game adaption of a series of adventure game books(similar to the CYOA style books that were very popular in the 80s/90s, although I think this series is exactly that) by Joe Dever, who presumably also helped make the game. I am not and have never been hugely into books as a favourite pass time but adventure books have always intrigued me, so to see a game that effectively plays like reading a book with huge interactivity(for example, the combat) is nice. If you don't want to read my whole review, the gist is that it's a very decent game so far but the combat is very flawed, specifically in RNG aspects.\n\nFirst off, the story. The story is just as you'd expect from a adventure-book-turned-video-game. I'd actually put it on the same shelf as The Witcher in terms of depth, specifically in the form of its codex and its writing (it is, after all, played like a book). As for the main character? Well, he really strikes me as a "Geralt-esque" character, is how I would describe him. So, your character, who is the last of his kind due to a obligatory massacre, goes to his fiefdom of which he is the lord of to find that it has been besieged and he has to save the day. There's a lot more to it than that but I'm not going to spoil anything. Tthe story may seem pretty bland but I can tell you that the story goes very slowly and isn't rushed at all, which means it has a lot of detail and work put into it.\n\nThe graphics are actually pretty good, and on my potato-computer it runs amazingly with most settings on, albeit in windowed mode. The character model itself is very well done and so are the models for the enemies. The book pages are  very well done as well and actually immersed me quite a few times, to the point that I just wanted to read the book pages and that's it. The only thing I can complain about is the lighting on some backgrounds interferes with certain QTE(explained later) icons.\n\nThe character-creation is pretty neat. You can choose your combat style (sword, axe, and mace) as well as your dominant stat (Strength, intelligence, or dexterity). You can also choose three(3) skills that are both usable in combat(buffs) and as options when making a decision in dialogue. For example, a group of enemies are caught taking a pee-break. You can use your dexterity to sneak around and shoot an arrow through their brains, or you can use your mind-over-matter ability and throw an object at them. Fun! Certain options give certain benefits, but they can also cause harm. For example, you can choose to ram open a door in one choice and it results in two out of three enemies being stunned in the following battle but in another scenario... Let's just say being brutish isn't always the best choice. There is no levelling either, persay. Your stats improve ever chapter in an act depending on the actions you performed, so if you want a lot of strength, presumably you would work towards making strength-based choices, but this also means you don't *have to* make certain actions. You can spice it up, especially since all of the stats are important (and improve your Kai energy requires you to make Kai choices, so spice it up a bit!). I believe the combat style(or your currently equiped weapon(s), since you can duel wield) that you choose also changes the attack abilities available to you.\n\nGameplay is a bit odd, in my opinion. Cut this short, there's several parts to the gameplay : Reading the book/story progression, turn-based combat that relies on QTE(mouse or keyboard options available) actions to determine if you hit or dodge etc, and a lock-picking minigame that is pretty much the bethesda format. There may be more but those are the ones introduced up to Act 2 so far. The book-reading segments are pretty much your book-reading segments, story progression. These segments also include making certain choices (e.g., using a skill or attribute to deal with a situation, either benefiting you or stabbing you in the back) which, suprisingly, actually feel like they matter because... They do. The lock-picking segment is *literally* the popular bethesda lockpicking. I don't even know if it originated from them, but that's what it's associated with. You move the lockpick around, see if you can force the lock, adjust if needed, and voila. Anyways, the turn-based combat is actually where this game falls quite a bit. I'm not going to go into detail but the entirety of the combat is QTE. Want to use your combat attack on this enemy? Better hit all three QTES! Want to parry this attack? QTE! Now, I'm actually misleading you quite a bit. The part that makes this *UNBEARABLE* is that your chance to hit/dodge is a %. Yes, it's a percentage. You can literally SEE this as your dodge value is a %. What does this mean? It means that to make the game "balanced", you have random chance, aka RNG, alongside you on your journey to decided whether not you're a brain-dead zombie or an acrobatic lightning bolt. Let's get one thing straight - RNG is artificial difficulty. It's not fair in any sense unless it's a strict 50-50 chance and it doesn't leave the results up to the player and their skill. You are absolutely at the mercy of chance, and most of the time the chance isn't even 50-50 but if you've ever taken a data-management course, you'd know that it's never garunteed to be a strict 10/20 hits if you have a 50% to hit. That's only the *chance* to hit, not the number of times you will hit. Now, this also applies to the enemies in that you can randomly miss *AND* randomly be countered by the enemies. It's such an infuriating design choice that really makes most of the combat complete chance. I did the same battle THREE(3) times and the first two times was me getting countered constantly and rarely ever dodging but on the third try, I was dodging like crazy and getting hit after hit in, and I didn't feel accomplished at all. I felt cheated. What makes it worse is that with a shield activated, you can go into a defense stance that lasts until your turn ends, but it has a cooldown meaning you only get a short break from the RNG. It's actually why I like action-RPGs more than anything else because skill is actually a factor in those. Aside from that rant, there are buffs you can cast which depend on your initally chosen skills and then there's your magic which you cast via your Sommerswerd(your magic claymore, basically). Finally, you can have ranged weapons which work amazingly well as end-of-turn weapons in that the only thing required to use them is turn time and the ammo(examples of such are throwing daggers and crossbow bolts). All of this is severely held back by the how often enemies tend to attack (more than you overall) and how much damage they are able to deal(especially a specifically heavy-infantry-type enemy later on) and of course the RNG. That's really the gist of how the combat works and it's VERY flawed, to say the least, but it also has a lot of potential.\n\nSo... That's my first-impression review of this game. I'm not going to quit it, mostly because I'm too enthralled by the writing and the story but the combat - OH LORDY, THE COMBAT. It's horrible. I just cannot and will not EVER praise RNG or accept it as good design. Get it on sale and it's a decent buy.\n\nFeedback is wanted! I want to get better at writing reviews.\n\nTL;DR - Gist is that it's a very decent game so far but the combat is VER flawed, specifically in RNG amd QTE aspects.","April 26","true","11.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","4"

The interface itself is beautiful, really nice and brilliant (although obviously a translation from a touch-screen/mobile device... don't be lazy, make it be PC specific!). The simple artwork animations do an amazing job of helping to invigorate the text and add to it. I cannot fault any of this - however amongst all this greatness there an utter and complete let down within the awful fighting mechanism.\n\n1) It feels like a JRPG - I know this is marmite, and I'm on the hate side of this. Does anyone actually like this rubbish mechanism? Anyone? You do? Why? Maybe you can expla... oh nostalgia... ok, so is there anything ACTUALLY good about it? No? Didn't think so... shall we all get over this nonsense and finally move on?\n\n2) They happen an awful lot and Lone Wolf seems completely ill-prepared and completely out-matched, it's a miracle he makes it through any battle. Also, so much randomness... again a fail-over over from JRPGs... at some point people will look back and go "You know those Final Fantasy games came out at the same time as Planescape: Torment and Baldurs Gate and were immensely lame in comparison... why are we still copying them?" Well... I don't know why anyone wanted to copy them instead of PT and BG in the first place, but who knows... maybe the dumbed down/random infuriating and thus dull reloading/restarting is for some people in the world that have nothing better to do. I however, want a game that has play-tested, balanced, and isn't JRPG. I'm sure even the patience of a Saint would be tried and have him throwing a controller around in frustration.\n\n3) All icons have cooldown on them... er... I have a cooldown on basic Attack/Defend? WHAT THE DICKINS?!?\nWho thought that was a good idea? Find them and give them a good slapping with a large wet fish.\n\n4) I have next to no endurance, and i'm completely useless without any of it... and it takes endurance to drink an edurance potion... er... ok... we'll chalk this one up on "Dumb Ideas".\n\n5) And the worse part of combat is the idiot waves his arm around often obscuring the ranged combat icon making it inaccessible. And when you can't always use basic icons over and over (cooldown - on the defend icon... duh) This kind of flaw is even more unforgivable.\n\nSo, there's a great game here, that I would love to play, it would need the awful fighting mechanics to be ripped out and replaced with something less utterly appalling.","August 18, 2015","false","1.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

I saw them for the first time when I was really young, and I was enthralled by the amazing world Joe Dever created.  With just one book, 'Flight from the Dark', I was hooked on the adventures of Lone Wolf, last of the Kai Lords, as he fought the Darklords of Helgedad and the forces of the god of darkness, Naar.\n\nJoe Dever does not disappoint with this game.  The writing, world building and feel of the story is a perfect match to the old CYOA books.  From the first moments of the game, you feel like you really are Lone Wolf, the last hope for Sommerlund.\n\nIt's an absolute travesty that this fantastic writing is ruined by positively garbage game design.  All of the problems in this game revolve around combat which, incidentally, was one of the biggest stumbling points in the original book series.  In the book series, it was because Dever had to write around the player potentially having the Infinity +1 Sword (The Sommerswerd).  In this game, it is because the designers couldn't be ♥♥♥♥♥ to make a fighting system that relied on something other than RNG and confusion.\n\nThe game has four chapters.  The first two, it is worth noting, are fantastic.  The combat is simple and to the point.  Enemies can hit decently hard, but you are well equipped to handle them and supplies are plentiful.  It isn't that the games design is better at this point, it is that the flaws are easier to overlook.  Combat will rarely be fatal, even if it takes a turn for the worse, and this keeps the player moving through the story, which is the real meat of the game.\n\nThe final boss of the second chapter is where things start to get really rough.  The enemy will go first, deals massive damage, and has a chance to stun you.  If you are stunned in this opening salvo, you WILL die before getting a chance to act at all.  The chance of this happening isn't too high, but it is still there, and most players will see it at least once, if not more.\n\nFrom then on, the game pulls no punches, in the worst ways possible.  Random encounters are BOSS level mobs, which make it easier to just reload an old save then to deal with the pointless slugfest.  Enemy monsters are filled with 'Rapid Clicking QTEs', which seem to be used for almost everything in the game.  Early on, you'd take some damage or screw an attack up if you failed.  Now?  Dead if you mess it up.\n\nI got sick and tired of it and just installed an auto clicker.  And even with that, it only makes the combat slightly LESS unfair.  You WILL die, many times, to swarms of foes before you can possibly react.  100% to dead before you can do anything, even if you were defending.  Adding onto everything else, the enemy is not held to the same mechanical rules that the player is.\n\nLone Wolf can act during his own 'phase'.  When his timer runs out, he cannot act for a bit, and then the cycle repeats.  The enemy has no such difficulty.  They can attack whenever they wish, your phase or not.  They can attack the millisecond your defenses drop (and often will) and hit with DoT effects that deal huge chunks of your health (similar DoTs are nearly scratch damage to them).\n\nThe original books were about controlling conflict.  You weren't an army slaying warrior, so you were supposed to be clever about how you engaged in fights.  This game not only forgot that, but went the other way and puts you into bland, annoying and uninteresting combat CONSTANTLY.\n\nIf you want a good story, I can recommend this game.  But I'd advise you to play Chapter 1 and 2 on Normal, then slam it down to Easy to just burn through the rest of the story without the BS.  There's no reason to give yourself a migrane over "Difficulty by Frustration."","May 20, 2015","false","16.2"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Did they not hire an editor?\n\nThe combat uses a QTE-driven version of, for lack of a better example, Final Fantasy 6's ATB system in which a bar fills up and you make your decisions. If you're quick enough you can use every action at your disposal during your turn. On the downside, when the bar runs out you have to wait for it fill back up. Combat animations get old after awhile, and the bulk of the game starts to feel like you're just doing the same QTE actions and combat patterns in the combat sequences after awhile.\n\nThe music and sound aren't particularly memorable, and it plays the same song on a loop in the reading portions of the game.","December 7, 2014","false","11.3"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

It's a bit weird to use, and the time mechanic is annoying rather than enriching, but it's workable. What isn't is that the controls bug out every 10 minuites or so. 4 times in less than 20 minutes, the game would suddenly stop interpreting my input as valid commands.Mouse stopped function, and keyboard stopped working even to access the main menu.

I find the story dull and overdone, and it tries to be way to gritty, and making most people in the world ♥♥♥♥ing incompotant\n\nin my opinion : it's honestly boring. alot of reviews were making this seam like a skyrim-esc game when I got it (apparently they never played skyrim), but it's not. the story seems like it's the same as about a dozen other fantasy games/storys. it tries to paint the character as being a badass, due to past actions, and that he's some sort of elite soldier with a magical sword that took down legions on his own. except you start the game fighting goblins who can half your health and that take a couple minuites to kill, so much for that whole elite soldier thing then I guess. theres an ability you can choose at the start that allows you to speak to animals, and if you pick it then you gain an ability to send a wild wolf to attack the enemies, where did it come from? why did it follow your orders, even though it's desribed as being wise? (because everybody knows that being wise is doing exactly what a strange man in leather tells you to). I dont know and I dont care enough to findout ESPECIALLY since it probably wont be adressed\n\nthe game is supposed to have a deap and branching story, but to me it feels like somthing one of my friends from high school would write in english. (he also thought that the nex fallout game should be about new vegas being over-run with deathclaws.despite the in game lore explaining why the wouldn't) from what I'v seen it's pretty much one of the fantasy stereotype storys turned into a game thats supposed to have a great story. the main chacter is just the same bland gritty-ness we've all seen a thousond times, yes it worked in 80s action films but times have changed.\n\noh sorry what am I saying; SOMWHAT RELITIC PAGE PHYSICS: 10/10 AHUR!

Actually, you are basically reading the game.  It is presented as in a very old book, with pictures that move (similar to the pictures in the Harry Potter movies).  You will make decisions every few pages and it affects how your story is written.  At times, the game leaves the book and goes into more of a 3rd person view.  There is combat that is sort of turn based but not entirely - you have a limited amount of time and energy to do things on your "turn", but your opponents won't just be standing there the entire time.  When it's not your "turn" you are either defending or just standing there exhausted if you didn't save any energy after doing your attacks.  (Sorry if I've done a poor job explaining this - you may have to see it to understand.)  Outside of combat, there are other actions that require you to quickly follow arrows on the screen with your mouse to be successful.  You will improve your skills and acquire items that will help you in your mission.\n\nSo for those of you familiar with the gamebooks, this is like one of those, with mini-games replacing the "select a random number" element.\n\nIf you're looking for the next Skyrim, this may not be for you.  If you're a life-long Joe Dever fan then you should buy this immediately without any further thought whatsoever.  For all others I suggest watching a few minutes of game play on youtube to decide if this is something that you would like.","December 20, 2014","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I missed him, or rather I missed immersing myself in the fantastical, gritty yet believeable world of Magnamund.\n\nI had doubts about purchasing the game but old loyalties won out. The fact that Joe Dever was involved sold it to me. I have not been completely disapointed.\n\nThe game - mostly - plays as a choose your own adventure book that cleverly utilises it is running on a pc and does away with the "turn to page X" stuff. You manually turn the pages and this was fun for the first 30 minutes but soon got a bit old.\n\nThe RPG element is solid and fully in keeping with the books, for example you choose your starting Kai skills, which help to give you different play throughs as new choices open up if you have the relevant discipline.\n\nThe only real downside for me is the Quick Time Events. I am not the fastest gamer - preferring stategy/rpg games and I like a pause button if I play anything faster. I do find the battles hard as you have to make certain mouse actions/click on circles etc in order to make attacks and it is - to me - very fast paced and this takes something away from the game for me.\n\nAll in all it is nice to spend time with my old pal Lone Wolf, the game does capture the atmosphere of the books, but I dont like the QTE.","March 12, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having completed the playthough I found myself captured to the end and await a sequal.\n\nThere is alot of parts to the game I found very enjoyable and not much I could point out for improvement, the game is a solid effort and well rounded. I really enjoyed both the combat and non-combat sections of the game and found it to be rather challenging, so felt rewarded when I had successes throughout the game.\n\nStory: The story of the game was done well much like the books were, I think it was a good implementation. Even where mistakes were made (I fell foul of a trap in the game after i thought i had overcome it...was cursing myself afterwards too haha), I was glad to see that it was indeed possible to make a story choice that would cost you your life in the game. Also reflecting on the game there were story choices that had both obvious outcomes and not so obvious outcomes which i thought was good, though personal preference would have me request more of the latter.\n\nCombat: As for combat... NAILED IT. I loved everything about the combat in the game. The combat mechanics were solid, i especially liked the fact you could overexert yourself at the expense of your own wellbeing.\n\nSome games allow you to adopt a fairly static playstyle, I usually find myself never really needing to use consumables... in this however they were very much a requirement, I actually found myself stocking up on poison arrows or throwing blades... I found myself throwing down stunpowder just to give myself some breathing room in some of the fights... I also found myself NOT doing area attacks in some situations because i didn't want to break the mindblast i did on an that Drakkarim... or chugging down a... stamina potion... just so I could disarm that vordak.\nI must say i never felt so relieved as when I took down 2 of those accursed things and a gourgaz that attacked me at once... that was a tough fight and I had to laugh when the giak came after the 3 of them fell and tried to be all tough.\nActually if i had one criticism about the combat scenes... at the end of them there needs more variation in the post combat animations... usually he's just standing there with his 2 weapons (i ran with 2 axes or sword+axe) and kinda looked like a try hard.\n\nBugs: - I didn't encounter a single bug... across the whole game...\n\nAudio: Sound track i found thematic and made good ambience, the sound effects from the fight scenes themselves were satisfying and not overdone or underdone, maybe some more variation in the enemy roars at the start of a fight scene would have topped it off. Instead of every enemy roaring, having curses, insults, shrieks, to mix it up a little would have staved off the little bit of repetiveness i noticed here. Same with grunts and shouts when executing attacks.\n\nGraphics: The graphics/Art tied in well to the feeling of the game i think that was trying to be achieved. The enemies all looked amazing, the last enemy of the game looked a bit cartoony i felt compared to the rest of the game(especially his death scene), but he was the pimped out big bad evil guy with ancient artifacts, so i get it.\n\nOverall if you ever read the books, you will probably enjoy this game as it's got the same feel (I found it slightly more casual than the books truth be told, but minor point).\nIf you're new to the Lone wolf world then you will find this game refreshingly different to other RPG's, If you like challenges then i suspect you will like this game, as your choices do matter and affect your game experience with both positive and negative outcomes for the actions you take.","December 30, 2014","true","21.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Be warned straight away, that the game is half book, half RPG combat/inventory management, and I mean that literally (you spend much of your time turning pages in a virtual book and reading).  It's based on the Lone Wolf CYOA books, and stays true to that formula for the most part.   Half of the game is simply reading the progressing story and making decisions on how to handle situations.  I will say that it's not nearly as difficult or high stakes as the original Lone Wolf books were, as most encounters can be handled whichever way you decide to go.  The other half of the game is a turn based / real-time hybrid RPG combat system (kind of like Final Fantasy 6/7 or Chrono Trigger, except with multiple actions available in one turn), which is surprisingly fun.  The difficulty seems to be balanced perfectly on normal difficulty (at least for myself), which keeps it engaging, though the combat can be a bit repetitive with a lack of variety of different enemies and only one party member.\n\nIf the idea of combining a CYOA book with a well balanced, fun, but slightly repetitive RPG combat system sounds interesting to you, check it out.  The writing isn't amazing, but it isn't terrible.  The art is cool, but limited.  The music is similarly nice, but very limited...in the end though, the real fun of the game for me is in making your own decisions as you roleplay your character, and the tough but fair combat.","October 15, 2015","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love the book approach to the rpg genre. I love the way the story is written in most cases. As a gamer that is also an avid reader, I can appreciate this game on two fronts and that makes a huge difference. However, not all is great in this review. What could have been a solid 9 out of 10, has to be demoted to a 7 out of 10 score from me. The culprit that's dragging this amazing game down with it? QUICK TIME EVENTS! The entire combat system is heavily dependant on them, and there's really NO NEED for such lazy mechanics that are more suited to a game that's to be played on your cell phone than on your computer. With a proper turn based combat system, this game would have been a 9 out 10 for me. As it sits, it's still worth playing, but the developers really need to rethink the quick time events moving forward in my opinion, as it detracts from the gameplay and the rpg mechanics that are otherwise spectacular.","January 1","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(maybe I've been playing too many JRPGs, but was hoping for some post-game material or something like a new game + haha XD) I usually don't play games every waking moment unless they really engage me, but this managed to do that. I've been a huge fan of the Lone Wolf gamebook series that I started reading in primary school.\nTo be objective though, it only started to feel fun after enduring insane frustration at the start with the QTE, combat style etc. After I got past that, it was just pure bliss and Lone Wolf just felt, well, Lone Wolf (i.e. like a boss).\nBtw, I want to stress that being a fan who has all the books does not automatically make me biased in the game's favor. I've got to admit that when I saw this game I was like "awesome!", but then again, when I tried playing this on my phone when it first came out and couldn't get the hang of it I was like "heck this!" and I gave up on it. Well, basically, my point is, the fact that I'm a huge fan of the series also means that I can be excessively unforgiving.\n\nJust a note if anyone's interested to know:\nI played through this game on normal and paid no attentions to builds (meaning I made decisions based on my own personality). Disciplines were sixth sense, mind over matter, weaponskill, healing, and my preferred style is sword dual- wielding (life started getting a lot easier after I switched to this style).","January 6","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The soundtrack is wonderful and the level of complexity is greater than your average visual novel or adventure game but not so detailed as to bog down play. It certainly has a high replay value in my mind given the branching paths and flexibility allowing you to solve problems by a variety of means depending on how you have built your character. A definite recommend for anyone who enjoys games such as Sorcery! or Telltale narrative-based titles.","March 10","true","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When you start playing it, it's pretty hard, but it gets easier the more you progress. The battles are not very interesting and there are only a few items and skills. What I really liked however is the abundance of choises. The puzzles are challenging and I enjoyed them. The story is ok and the writing is pretty good.
