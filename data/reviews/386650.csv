You get to experience the journey of development as the game progresses and as new features get implemented it is like receiving regular gifts.\n\nI've just had to use Task Manager to quit out of Dungeons & Robots 5-10 times in the space of 15 minutes.  I've had problems with controls, the sound and the menus.  It's just not even playable in its current state.\n\nThis is the type of release that gives Early Access a bad name.  The devs need to fix the basics before collecting cash from people.\n\nRefund requested.

There will be bugs and glitches.  The game does need some serious quick polish to get it to at least beta status.  BUT the core concept of the game is great, it has some really huge potential.  So I would only buy this game if you really want to help the game improve, otherwise I would follow and wait for some patches to roll out.\n\nAs I said above, the game is a top-down/isometric shooter.  What makes this fun is that you don't click to move, you do so by using WASD and you shoot your guns with left click and right click, which makes combat very interactive.  You have 4 skills that you can have and equip, an example is one that increases your attack speed and you have 1 armor ability that you get when you wear certain armors.\n\nThere are two game modes currently, defense mode where you defend a certain object against waves of enemies.  The other one is explorer mode where you get a random objective and have to complete them, an example is to collect X amount, or escorting a person to the exit.  For combat it all boils down to pretty much kiting and shooting aliens until they are dead, they have some variety in their attacks, but not that much.\n\nFor character customization there are a lot of things you can do.  Each character has a skill list where you can put points, into a variety of different stats such as increase damage, increase health, increase armor, etc... Best thing is you can re-roll your points any time you want (when you're not in a game), this allows you to experiement with different builds.  You earn these skill points by leveling up your character and to level up you complete mission objectives and gain experience at the end.\n\nAnother great thing is you can customize the looks of your robot.  You can find different armor and weapon pieces when you play, they are random drops in the level, and they change your looks.  Another great thing is that these pieces have random stats on them, so not every piece is the same, this will give you further character customization.  Also you can craft gear by finding crystals in the dungeon and have a chance to make a rare.\n\nLastly with regarding modifications, you can upgrade your armor and weapon pieces, they increase defense and attack respectively.  There can be other modifications too, but that I haven't discoverd yet.\n\nOne feature this game has that I'm not too fond of and I'm sure other as well, is an online only game, there is currently no option for offline (no internet) play.  Reason is there are online features in this game such as guilds, auction house (will be in game in the future), and various co op modes.  For this price though I can look past this feature, but if it were any higher I wouldn't have bought it as I really don't like online only games.\n\nFrom a singleplayer standpoint, the game is very playable.  I have been playing exclusively solo and been doing just fine.  Although the game is geared more towards co-op play though, but not needed if you don't want to.\n\nFrom a hours:gameplay value, you will definitely get your money's worth and more.  Content-wise as in levels there isn't much at the moment (will be more soon), the hours come from farming for crystals, finding items, and crafting awesome gear for your character.\n\nOverall the game has been great and really the sky's the limit, again, such huge potential.  Also, the devs are very active with the community.  Quick response and fixes, I don't know many games that have this kind of dev interaction, more games need to be like this.\n\nI hope this review helps you in deciding if you should purchase the game or not.","March 1","true","17.8"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","21","26","0","2"

It barely works. When I started it the first time, it put me in a "dungeon", which was just a small circle. It was basically one screen. I don't know if that was intentional. Maybe it was supposed to be a tutorial area or something like that. I checked all corners. No way out. So I opened the ugly menu and chose "Leave". It then got stuck in a loading loop. After some minutes I had to close the game. Second time it actually showed me a menu screen that wasn't there last time. So that was good. Bad thing was the sound was gone. Completely gone. Silence. I started a game anyway. So now the game kind of worked, which was good, I guess. But the gameplay just wasn't any fun, because of a serious bug in the combat. You are supposed to change your direction in a 360 degrees fashion, but that doesn't work in all directions. So sometimes you are able to shoot just a little bit to the left, so you can hit the enemy. And sometimes it just switches to 4-directional shooting. That means you are constantly trying to find the right angle, but then have to move in a weird way, because it won't let you shoot where you want. It's a mess.\n\nThose were the bugs I found in my few minutes of gametime. But even if they fix all that during the early access phase, I don't just see a decent game here. The level design is horrible. You mostly walk in corridors. For a twin stick shooter that means you move either forward (when you want to progress the level) or backward (when there's an enemy). That's basically all you do. It's boring, right from the beginning. It doesn't help that you have only one weapon, that has a recharge functionality, which means you can't fire all the time (which is what I would want from a shooter like this). Sure, you will unlock more weapons as you progress. But the game is so boring from the get-go, that I am not even interested in progressing. There is a stealth ability with a pretty heavy cooldown. But I didn't find any real use for it. Seemed out of place. The graphics are bad. The enemies feel uninspired. The camera needs to be rotated by the player with L1/R1, which also feels strange. Sometimes you see enemies too late. Also, they can shoot through obstacles, while you can't. Sorry, I just don't see this game getting any good.","March 11","false","0.8"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","16","21","0","0"

First of all, I had to reboot my pc, to run this game, because It showed me strange error (really I saw this one first time in my life) which told me that game can not run in 1920x1080 60hz.\n\nWhen I did it, the game asked me to enter my nickname, and no login or password, maybe it use my Steam account to log on.\n\nInstead of main menu, this game showed me tutorial, the shortest tutorial I've ever seen, then after that, I saw character menu, where I could upgrade my character, craft something, switch options, e.t.c. Actually I bought this game because I thought this would be like Diablo + Sci-fi or something like that. So when I saw the character menu, I was like "Yeah, that what I actually thought!". But then, I tried to set my graphics to high level, because in-game font was looking kinda "distorted", and the only graphical options that I found instead of Resolution was "unity-like-preset-options" fast>fastest>beatiful>fantastic, and ABSOLUTELY ANY confirmation of each option provided CRASH of that game. But after restart, I notice that in-game SOUND IS TURNED OFF, And there is no way to run it again! But graphical settings were saved!\n\nAfter I ran the solo-match, and.. yes this is session-like game, where you can join to room with others players, for co-op missions. So I started the game, and I promise you, that graphics will burn your eyes, ground is distorted and glowing, your character can run on any obstacles, you can even fall(!) from a great height! Come on! Even PoE is more careful with that!\n\nProcedurally generation levels are pointless, because every location is same as where you were 5 seconds ago. And there is only one type of dungeon, I think.\n\nAnd there is Timer in top-right corner of the screen, I am not entirely sure what that means, But I think this is game over countdown or something. That Timer even in solo-missions, I just don't...\n\nI want to say that this game contains:\n\nFirst-time running issues\nSound problems\nPoor Graphic settings\nThis game could crash in any moment.\nIn-game bugs like you can run on obstacles.\nPoor Level Design\n\nMaybe there are much more problems, but I can't stand more than 20 minutes in this game.\n\nP.S.

Monsters are getting tougher with each update which is all fine and well, but 350 damage weapons that consume massive amounts of energy deal a tenth of that to monsters who have several thousand hit points. It's not even possible to kill things anymore without being in a group but there aren't enough people playing to group up. While I felt this game had a bit of potential, they're making things worse with the updates instead of fixing the issues at hand and while they're fixing bugs, that doesn't account for much when you can't play the game bug free anyways.\n\n- Weapons: they're terribly balanced. Some are just outright useless (Laser, Flamethrower) with the minigun being easily the best. It has almost as much damage per hit as the other weapons, is the most cost effective on Energy VS. DPS, and with the highest attack speed by far it's easily the highest DPS. there are also only 5 weapon types in the game at the moment, and one of them is pure support and the only possible substitute over miniguns so variety is slim.\n\n- Frames: The light frames are poorly balanced as of now having little to no purpose on being in the game aside from your starter frame. They accel in neither tanking ability nor energy, and their default skill is useless compared to some others.\n\nThe medic has roughly the same hp/armor values and significantly higher energy allowing you to sustain damage longer along with a skill that full restores hp/energy to yourself and nearby allies letting them outshine light mechs who can only invuln for a bit until hit/hitting something or the 10 seconds are up.\n\nHeavy mechs are definitely the tankiest but with how negligable armor feels right now and the inability to put their high weight limit to the task since there really isn't anything extremely heavy in the game.. they feel slightly underwhelming compared to medic frames, all the more so considering their slow speed causes them to take significantly longer on completing missions and often getting left behind. Heavier weapons with much higher values and the armor actually giving a significant decrease to damage taken would allow them to shine a bit more and giving them a higher regen value would also help so fingers crossed they actually give them a good purpose.\n\nStats - Health and armor can help slightly but with how hard mobs hit you'll want to be putting most of your effort into dodging, regeneration rates are the same across all frames and hp is so low that past a certain point it becomes nearly negligable. Energy regen being a flat 20 (28 with full upgrades to it from levels) also leaves no room for thought. That leaves you with mobility and energy values, and since energy is basically your amunition it easily takes priority to ensure you've enough sustained damage to kill things efficiently. Mobility is your best tool for survival so that does take some priority but any of the mechs can move around well enough to dodge most things without focusing too heavily on it (and with a high enough mobility it can actually be detrimental to your survivability causing you to run into things you can normally walk straight around) It further enhances the singular aspect of the game where you just want as much energy as possible with enough hp to take a couple hits in order to sustain your damage.","March 1","false","11.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Considering this game has just come out on early access if you do purchase the game there is not much content currently.\n\nWith that being said the Boss fights are a blast, Challenging, very eye appealing and will most definitely give you a challenge later on down the road.\n\nThere are two game modes currently available to play. Explorer, and Defend.\n\nExplorer is a dungeon that you are thrown into where you have a main quest, and a challenge quest for extra experience at the end of the level. Throughout the level you are tasked with doing a few things where you will come across gear on the grown, crafting materials and traps.\n\nWhile playing defend you have what looks like some object or base thing that you need to protect through various enemy waves.\n\nThis game so far looks gorgeous, runs pretty well considering the fact its just released. So yes you can expect a few bugs and things that do not run correctly but I know the developer is working hard on it and actively making the game better.\n\nI do have to say that I am really excited to see what this game can become bacause it has the possibility to be extremly addicting expecially with your friends.\n\nThis game earns Ghost's Stamp of Approval.","February 29","true","11.9"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

It's a nice concept and the base for all the really good stuff is already there. When or if this game comes further along, I'll likely change my review. I intentionally played the game for under 2 hour so I would have the ability to refund it later if I did not think it was going to go anywhere.\n\nPROS:\n-Aesthetics:\nIt looks ♥♥♥♥ing great. Honestly, it does. The low poly style goes really nice with robots, although I can't say the same for some of the enemies.\n\n-Customization:\nBuilding your robot with different parts, although currently limited is actually really fun, and there are some pretty cool characters you can make. The game does let you have 5 different equipment set ups, that you're able to swap through in the menu and at a little pad near the start of each level.\n\n-Ability to refund skill points\nSkill points can be refunded for no cost any time. This is really great, as you can mess around and see which stats you think work the best for you.\n\nCONS:\nThat's about it for what's good. For the rest of what I say, I wouldn't take it as why the game is bad, but rather what would make the game better. The only real reason I'm not playing more of this game right now is due to its clear lack of content and extremely repetitive "missions".\n\n-Repetitive "Missions":\nI'm going to chalk this one up to the game still being fairly new. Currently there are only two modes, PvP and Explore. I have not been able to play PvP yet, as basically no one plays this game (got to about rank 50 world after 1.5 hours). Explore is really misleading, because it's not exploration at all. You just walk through a very linear cave system filled with enemies, and you're offered two goals. The main goal is always the same, although they give them different names, you're basically just going up to objectives and pressing F. Once you've pressed F on enough different objectives, you head to the boss and leave. You can go to the boss before hand, but you won't get any loot if you haven't completed at least one objective. The sub objectives are really well done, they're basically just a small randomized goal. Collect X amount of X crafting materials, crit X number of times or don't change your loadout during the mission. These accomplish their goal pretty well, and offer an extra chance at loot when completed.\n\n-Artificial difficulty:\nThe game never actually becomes more challenging. Just harder to do the same exact thing you were doing. More enemies with higher stats. It gets to the point where you'll just be swarmed and killed in the same spot over and over again unless you press the 'escape' button and select the suicide command, which teleports you to some spot back on the map. There's more to this swarming issue, but I'll bring that back up in a bit. I don't mind the enemies getting more stats, it makes sense because I do much more damage when I get better gear. But making boss fights and side rooms with loot just swarm with enemies is really annoying. They will block you in, stunlock you and just kill you over and over again. In harder levels, it's better to just ignore all the enemies and run past everything while completing the objectives. You don't get anything for killing them anyways, except 1 random crafting material sometimes. With the game being called an action rpg you would think fighting would be the main focus. If combat in a combat centered game become something you'd rather just avoid altogether, then there is very little reason to keep playing.\n\n-Basic attacks cost power:\nThis really got me upset, and I put up with it because I wanted to get a better feel for the game before I wrote a review. There is a power system in the game, which is basically the equivalent of a mana bar in any rpg. Your skills use power, but their cooldowns are so long (and for a good reason, they're mostly pretty strong) that it's basically negligible. Because of this, you're left to just shoot your left and right guns most of the game, which is what is shown in all the trailers so I expected as much. The issue is that your basic attacks cost power. I can't tell if this was supposed to be something you were supposed to "strategically work around" or learn how to manage, but it basically just leaves you kiting enemies for half the time you're in the dungeon since you're literally unable to do anything but walk around. Usually in mmos, when you were out of mana or your skills are on cooldown, you'd use basic attacks for filler. In this game, since your skills are on a super long cooldown, your basic attacks are basically your spells and there's nothing you can even do for filler except run away until it's back up. I suppose this wouldn't be an issue if power regenerated quickly, but even with the regeneration stat almost maxed out and multiple pieces of regeneration gear you run into really long down times on certain weapons. It doesn't add to any sort of difficulty or level of skill, it's just frustrating.\nI'm not a game developer myself, so I can't really say what they should do instead, but I have a pretty good idea. I'll include it at the end.\n\n-Skills are bland:\nI don't mean your active abilities, these skills are what you use your skill points on when you level up. They are the equivalent of your stats or attributes in other games. It was obvious at first look, there wasn't a ton of thought behind this. Like I said earlier, I'm not a game developer so I can't say what they should do instead. Usually when I play an rpg one of the most fun things is min maxing and creating cool builds. These skills offer very little in that aspect and its pretty obvious what you want to put points into, which leads to everyone ending up with basically the same stats. Tanks will probably differ from DPS, but within each category everyone will basically be the exact same.\n\nBUGS:\nThe unintentional cons of early access games. I expected a few of these.\n\nCan't jump, but can get on different Z-levels? What?:\nSo remember when I said that there is more to getting swarmed than just dying a lot? Well yeah, the enemies will just push you onto themselves or terrain and move you vertically up off the map. It's impossible to move some of the time and you can't shoot them at all since you're on a separate Z-level, but since the enemies can hit you and they will kill you in the same spot until your use the suicide option to reset your position. This also assists players in completely ignoring fights all together. If you get trapped only by a few, you can get yourself pushed on top of terrain and then just bypass large groups of enemies to grab objectives and leave the mission with very little risk. This needs to be fixed.\n\nHonestly this is the only bug I really even noticed, but it was a pretty big deal. Otherwise, this game seems to be pretty polished in that aspect.\n\nSUGGESTIONS:\nI'll say it again: I'm not a game developer myself, so I can't really say what they should do instead. But I'm going to anyways.\n\nPower? How about overheating:\nThe power mechanic is frustrating and sucks. It'd be easier to and a lot more fun to just change it to an overheat system. The support abilities' power costs are virtually nonexistent, and it's not like they should have any when they already have really long cool downs. As far as basic attacks consuming power, it just looks as though the developers wanted to make sure people couldn't just spray their guns forever. Which makes sense, that'd make the game kinda easy. An overheat mechanic would take out the massive amount of downtime where players have to kite for 20 - 30 seconds at a time while waiting for a decent amount of power to regenerate.

All the bad reviews are from the first day with in hours of playing the game. EARLY ACCESS means the DEV's are going to be fixing the problems with game. I personally didn't see anything wrong that would make someone quit or Rage on Review's to give it a bad rep.\n\nWhy should you listen to me, well because it is the 3rd day and i have almost 30 hours of playing time. LOL\nThis Game.\nIt's alot more fun than the pictures show. Graphics are good or at least on my 46 inch TV they are LOL. It's a dungeon game and a leveling game and a crafting game that keeps track of your stats, and has a leaderboard system.\n\nWhat makes the game fun.\nFor me, i like playing with other people, Co Op is up to 4 people. You can make a guild at level 3, and after that you play with friends. The dungeons are pretty basic, But where it keeps you playing the game is the crafting and item finding and than the turf wars. You see in the game you conquor land with your guild. That is what will keep you on your toes.\nThis game does not have quest like some dungeon games. But when you click co op or solo play it randomly gives you a misson to do. You also can choose different modes to play from easy  to normal to hard ex..... Now all the issues people listed in the bad reviews the dev's are working on them. For the price of the game it is an awesome buy. Just don't exprect no errors to happen because it is early access. So if you like dungeon games and killing mobs leveling and crafting. An like doing it with friends. Join the game now and either join someone guild or make your own at level 3. Either way i'll be online and if you are not. Sucks to be you, Hope to see all of you who read this online soon.","March 2","true","73.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I've spent more time running around aimlessly around large and largely unpopulated maps, with absolutely no idea where I'm supposed to go, than I've spent actually doing something enjoyable in the game.\n\nThere's just, a whole lot of really basic elements you'd expect to have in a game that just aren't there, and alot of what is there is giving me that wtf look. Basic things like seperate audio controls for sound and music, or the ability to turn the music off. Server disconnects that kick to menu with all progress lost, even in solo play.\n\nSure, it's a first day release into EA. They might fix things, I hope they do fix things. I still can't review what isn't there.\n\nI would say for those looking to test a new game and real supporters of the EA idea it's worth looking into. For anyone who wanted a new game to play who're willing to deal with incomplete features, wishlist and wait. It's just not there yet.\n\nThe more recent update addressed some of my concerns and complaints tabled above, namely the adition of a map feature. It's crude in its presentation but effective.

If this is their beta, then this game is the equivalent of a game design student project. Definitely not worth the $8 I paid.\n\nThe music it starts off with is nice. To be fair I didn't have it crash on me. But the gameplay is uninspired. The level art direction is ugly. It's running down linear narrow paths. It looks like you're a robot transported to a 90's version of a hell level. Why are there robots in hell?\n\nThe gameplay is stiff and awkward. It's also slow.\n\nThe best thing this game has going for it is the sound design, and whoever modeled the robots. They look cool, and they sound cool. They don't move all that well. The control scheme is plain awkward and stiff. The combat is boring and uninspired.\n\nIt's cool if this game was made by students still going to school. I'd be proud of it, but i'd never try and sell it other than a concept to get a job at a real studio.\n\nKudos to them for trying, but this is beyond embarrassing if you're asking people for money to play this.","February 29","false","0.3"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","10","19","0","1"

Sometimes it's doing the full turning animation to move and sometimes it's instant, which creates some disparity in responsiveness. The ground textures also often don't tile correctly into each other, very noticeable in narrow paths and it looks looks very bad. The UI also needs some rework in the future, some text has anti-aliasing and some are very jaggy. Also, add the ability to double click onto items to equip them instead of having to press the 'equip' button. While you're at it, add the ability to use esc or mouse4 to cancel out of menues since the back button is in a very inconvient place which makes you travel quite far to reach it.\nWeapons are also somewhat goofy right now. You can keep tapping to bypass the fire rate limit, turning something like an energy launcher which has a firerate of 1, into a minigun.\n\nOverall, it just lacks polish and a lot more content, argueably it also lacks a proper options menue, but I've seen worse.\nIf there's no update within 2 weeks, I would personally write this off, but as of right now, I can recommend it.","February 29","true","1.2"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","10","20","0","0"
