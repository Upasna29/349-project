However, FATALE's message is ultimately muddled. Rather than grabbing onto the play's theme most suited to exploration in video game form (e.g. its obsession with the danger of "looking" and its positioning of the aesthetic gaze as, paradoxically, both creative/reverent and destructive/dehumanizing), FATALE instead spends most of its 20 minute running time on plot and a conceptually murky sequence where the player extinguishes candles on a static 3D tableau.\n\nThus, ultimately the game plays like a hollow bit of 3D diorama--with the candles just being an excuse to get the player to look at different parts of the scene. An interesting and often pretty experiment, but ultimately vague and underwhelming, both as a game and as a commentary on Wilde's play.","April 9, 2012","false","0.7"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","25","31","0","0"

I said it’s a powerful poem when I first played it years ago, Fatale is belongs to those “serious, deep and sad things” I always like. It’s perfect in its own, but yes it’s horrible.\n\nAnd they updated it this year make it has another feeling, more emphasis on the text by Oscar Wilde, more understanding the story. I appreciate they updated those old artworks, it made me think they still keep their early ideas of making digital artworks, though I know they’re going to change under the big pressure of contemporary game circles, obviously people have strong opinion about what is a game and what is not, then refuse to accept new possibilities, it's just a wrong place for non-games. Even I feel the pressure writing this review, too many people rate down and give negative comments.\n\nI love all of ToT's artworks. Steam is a place for mainstream gamers not a place for serious conversations, but I have to say a few words in the end, peoples who describe them as "pretentious" please read more information before judging. They're never pretentious because they know what they are doing, their works are true and explicable, no one "trying to seem more intellectuall" than they really are.","July 7, 2014","true","0.2"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","0"

Their endless ambition and imagination can easily be seen with the amount of care they put into their projects. They are simply a once in a lifetime experience, and for all the effort that Tale of Tales puts into their work, the payoff is almost infinite.\n\nFor instance, as of this writing, Tale of Tales has priced The Graveyard at a fair $4.99, and it takes less than 20 minutes to complete the game in its entirety. I actually managed to beat Bientôt l’été in a whopping 80 minutes, and it's priced at only $9.99. With FATALE, at only $6.99, it took me a very fulfilling half hour to reach the end. What amazing value!\n\nMeanwhile there are developers who think they can hock games such as The Binding of Isaac for an exorbitant $4.99, of which I've only managed to squeeze over 50 hours of gameplay and I haven't even completed the game yet. What a joke.\n\nDon't forget that Tale of Tales introduces highly intuitive controls with each iteration of magnificent gaming art. Thank god I can now only move my head while holding the left-mouse button, which also causes me to walk forward at the same time. I could never understand wanting to keep still while being able to freely look by solely moving the mouse around. Primitive WASD scheme is completely thrown out the door, and good riddance. Half-Life 2 has nothing on FATALE when it comes to traditional game mechanics.\n\nIf you haven't done so already, you simply owe it to yourself to play every single one of Tale of Tales' amazing artworks. It's like trying to suck your own ♥♥♥♥ and failing, but that small glimmer of hope is the only thing that motivates you to continue trying. Just once more inch.\n\nUntil you break your neck.\n\nThen you definitely know it was all worth it.\n\n/s","April 27, 2013","false","0.5"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","12","20","2","2"

This one may be the arty-est. Well, actually, I'm not going to say that. The difference between the arty-est and farty-est of games and this is that this has some elements that can actually cause you to see it as a game. Tale of Tales isn't known for being the most accessible of game developers, at least where this sort of thing is concerned.\n\nWhat's good about it?\n\nThe graphics are gorgeous in a primitive way, and I would compare them to The Path (another ToT title) in terms of actual quality. As always, the soundtrack is superb in getting across what it wants to, but I can't help but be upset that this isn't a DLC - because I would probably pay a dollar for it.\n\nThe soundtrack is the best part of it, and it bears mentioning because it carries a strange post-Swans Jarboe/Tom Waits in an ashram feel to it oddly plopped into some nameless middle-Eastern country and peppered with some modern instruments to make your liver quiver. I half expected a duet between the indie art goddess and the god of Bruce Springsteen's career to come leaping out of my speakers at the same time, causing a bizarre existential crisis that would coexist with my current one, and ultimately lead to me going crazy.\n\nThings I didn't like...\n\nThe fact that I do not need Tom Waits and Jarboe to sing a duet and drive me to the point of an existential crisis, because if I had to light one more friggin' candle, I was going to light my own hair on fire and scream for someone to hold the nameless unexplaind darkness over it to put it out. Then, I would dance traditionally without a shirt on so I could lead the non-Oscar Wilde reading bible crowd to describe it as, "erotic," and attempt to censor it.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nLook, this game is worth your time and your buy, especially if you want to be in awe for an hour or so of your life, but if you're not into art games and weird clanky noises laid underneath of some of the oddest non-standard chord progressions, you're not going to like it. For me this is a solid 7.5/10, and as an art piece I'll probably revisit it later, but it's not something I'm going to sit in front of my computer and think, "Oh, I have an extra few hours to kill, maybe I'll just open Fatale and put out some stupid candles."","January 4","true","0.8"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","14","24","0","0"

The game is about setting up an atmosphere, trying to be an interactive piece of art. However, the only real emotion I felt during the game was confusion, because I had no idea what I was supposed to do. And while some people might huff and reply that clearly I don't GET the game, that I shouldn't judge Fatale by the same standards I judge the common man's shoot 'em up, I am going to stand my ground and say that if the goal of a game is not clear, then it will be difficult for players to get anything out of the experience, because they will just be confused. Unlike The Path, which rewarded players for blindly wandering around, this game provides no direction. It is trying really hard to be artsy, I get that, but it is FAILING.

If it's suppose to be a game, then it's a terrible game, with no playability and embarrassingly bad controls. If it's an interactive art exhibit, then it's a beautiful installation, based on a play by Oscar Wild. It deals with life after death, and toys with the idea of there being an awkward transition between this world and the next.\n\nSo, if you want a "survival horror" game, you're going to be disappointed.\nBut, if you want to have a brief, artsy experience, go play The Path.\n\nSeriously, this game is only a tiny bit longer than The Graveyard.

I liked the game very much, especially the second chapter, but, really, it's a very special genre, and it can't just be taken by everyone. Salome, by herself, was a horrible person, irrational one, partially mad and erratic. This line feels really good in this game. You watch the story of her madcap deed, while Salome stays romantic and proudful, and that is amazing and shivering. I recommend this game as an interactive painting of the story, with which you should be familiar.

The simple puzzles are simple. The artwork in the game is interesting. The music is very nice to listen to and very Arabic. There are 3 levels to this game and each level has its own thing it does. The Exploring Salome is about the Daughter of Herodias who was queen of Chalcis and Armenia Minor. The name Salome means "peace" in Hebrew. Salome is a first century Judean princess mentioned in the Christian Bible by Matthew and by Mark. B. In the Bible, Salome is a child who dances for King Herod and asks the head of John the Baptist as a reward. Most of Fatale takes place in the aftermath of this event, when all has turned quiet and the moon brings comfort to troubled hearts. The overall game is wonderful and very tastefully creative.","October 11, 2011","true","3.2"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

You'll thank me for it.\n\nUm... I bought this game at the time because it was one of the cheapest games I could find on steam. I don't quite think I got my money's worth. The description said that it continued the plot of a certain play... but it didn't really continue it from what I could tell, so much as just tack on one final scene. It's got some pretty scenery though, but it feels like the authors fell (very) short of their goal. It feels like they wanted  do something bigger and grander.\n\nHowever, I'd still suggest buying it for the game connoisseur, as it does serve as a fair lower benchmark for judging a gaming experience. Kind of like comparing the sizes of states or countries to Rhode Island. Rhode Island isn't big, but it's a good benchmark for size. FATALE fell short of its vision, but its dirt-cheap, and that makes a good tool to judge other games by.\n\nShort version: On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd rate this game a 1, but It's a cheap way to get to truely know what a 1-rated game is like, and in turn, it will help you appreciate all your other games that much more.\n\nThis game is to videogames what "The Room" or "Star Wars Christmas Special" is to cinema. It's not the "so bad it's good" but it passes right out the other side to where it's really REALLY bad. But, like I said, it gives you a chance to really appreciate what a bad game is, so you aren't tempted to call a "good but not as good as you wanted" game a bad game.","April 17, 2011","true","0.8"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"
