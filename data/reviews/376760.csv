You control Ben and his sister (?) Becky. Ben has the ability to transform into different animals and shapes, just like Fred Clever (Mort in English) from the Clever & Smart (Mortadelo y Filemón, in English "Mort & Phil") comics by Francisco Ibáñez Talavera.\n\nThe objective of the game is to collect five kinds of stars and then win twice an end challenge that plays like a board game. For that I used around 50-60 stars, so one must collect quite a few to even begin with.\n\nWhen first playing, one can (with the help of parents probably) enter his name and birthday, the name will be shown at the end of the game after beating the final challenge (although the game itself is seemingly an endless mode, so there is no end afterwards but rather can still play on and on).\n\nThe whole game is controlled with the mouse. It consists of a hub world and separate minigames. The hub world is a house and garden, the minigames range from spelling words over finding out what trash can be recycled to painting a face - or any picture. There are several flaws in this game, for example the menus can be brought up only by moving the mouse outside the screen (something that however was normal at the time the game was created, seeing as a similar mechanic was used in Sam & Max Hit The Road). More severe are game-specific flaws. The trash game is difficult if you're a foreigner, but the severe flaws are in painting and the "hide & seek" game. The painting has an undo option that however seems to undo one action only (or maybe very few). The "hide & seek" makes it not always possible to solve the game with the given clues. Outdoor, on a dry place, on the left side of the map can by my definition have several possibilities. The other times I played the hints were enough, so maybe I just had bad luck the first time. Another flaw is that in the creative parts (painting, making music) your creativity is interrupted when you get stars.\n\nThe end of the game can be reached in an hour or maybe less, but this should not be a turn-off, since it is possible to play on afterwards, and I suppose children will take their time with it and not rush through like I did for review purposes (as such, I also did not play all minigames), so the asked price is fine, although the games by this publisher also go on sale sometimes. Personally I picked up the Humongous Complete Pack when it was 66 or 75 percent off, so if there is time, this is a great option to wait for.\n\nThe sound is nothing special, but it is noteworthy that the voice samples of each game repeat often. The graphics are not too good, but not bad either. The style easily allows for creative transformations of Ben. Interestingly, the minigames, especially the one where you read a book and replace words, sometimes have better graphics. They all look like just painted in 2D by a skilled but not master artist.\n\nWhat remains is a compilation of minigames that might be an interesting learning tool for the intended audience - kindergarten children - with the possibility for them to learn a few basic things - spelling short words, addition up to the number 10, counting to 12 (via the clock game) while also having basic creative tools at their disposal. The characters Ben and the girl as well as the side-characters will surely be lovable at that age.\n\nA positive technical point at the end: The game is emulated via ScummVM. Upon starting it, one can choose between starting normally or without OpenGL.\n\nA word of caution must be said: As Steam is intended to be for age 13 and up, parents are advised to always watch their children when they play something, especially if the community features are enabled. As a protective measure, I suggest turning the Steam Overlay off for this game, that way the play can also go uninterrupted by popup messages / group announcements.\n\nRecommended: For the targeted audience = kindergarten children. Turning Steam Overlay off advised.","September 23, 2015","true","1.0"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","20","20","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/376760/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","Big Thinkers Kindergarten is a game for kids, mainly those that can't read or learning to read. In other words, it's for kids under 6 or 7 years old. In it, you have a brother and a sister that can tranform themselves in many things and that are explaining the games and encouraging kids. Ben and Becky are searching for Smart Stars around their house. And these can be obtained by playing minigames.\n\nFor example, you'll find in the kitchen three minigames that will cover three domains: Alphabet Skills, Measurement & Estimation and Sequencing & Patterning. Solve them and you'll get stars, showing your progress in these. The chart can be found in the living room. Or if you go to the library, you can let your imagination wander thanks to the Art Creativity field or the Reading & Sentences one.\n\nThe games are really varied and use mechanics that you still find today in educational applications. So, yeah, I do think that Big Thinkers Kindergarten can be still in use nowadays. However, what may be a little hard to get past at is the graphics.\n\nNot that I mind old graphics, as you know. After all, I began playing with Super Mario Bros and Doom II triggered a real passion. But some of them aren't aging well. Big Thinkers is among them. It's like seeing an old cartoon. True, back then, these were frequent in the adventure genre. However, today, it seems not at all clear. There are many information on the screen that it's nearly making you scream that it's not user-friendly. I understand that the education behind is probably the main reason but I don't care about words like Pantry or Rightly, though I suppose that for the kids, it's showing them something that is obvious for the adult.\n\nAnyway, you can interact with nearly everything, as far as your cursor is a white arrow. As an adult, it can seem to be too much but for a kid, it's amusing. Myself, I got intrigued by what can happen.\n\nIf I have to say something for the soundtrack, it's correct. It's more the voice acting that is a pain in my ears, mainly Ben's voice. I'm always under the impression that he tries to be louder than Becky.\n\nBig Thinkers is in English. Total English. I don't know if there were any translated version because it would have been interesting for the other languages. If as a teacher or a parent, you have no problem in English as second language, you can guide your kid in the game. I didn't understand the super challenge however. And it's not always easy to understand the clues in the sandbox game. But at least, many of the games aren't oriented towards English. Alphabet Skills is purely focused on the order of the letters (the 26 are there) or on recognizing the letter in lowercase. The Art Creativity game is focused on making a new head for Ben, the Sequencing and Patterning games is about guessing the end of a sequence though shapes and color, etc.. On 15 games, 9 of them are accessible for people not fluent in English.\n\nBig Thinkers Kindergarten is a good educational game, whether for the classroom or for home. The graphics may have aged not so well but the rest is still "modern".\n\nAh and if you don't manage to find how to exit the game, put your mouse at the bottom of the screen, the menu should appear. It's sad that there is nothing to indicate it though.","February 15","true","5.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Fourteen years later, I decided to pick it up and play it for nostalgia's sake. This game brought back so many memories.\n\nThis game goes through many different topics and most games can be adjusted in difficulty: Easy (!), Medium (!!), or Hard (!!!). The difficulties will progress by themselves but if the progression is not maintaining your child's speed, then you can adjust to fit their needs.\n\nThis game is sily enough to keep a child entertained but maintains its educational status incredibly well. You can have them complete patterns, learn measurements, learn reasoning, logic and problem solving, and all while having a great time. It may not be as effective as a workbook or classwork, but this game will build the basis for your child's kindergarten career.","September 5, 2015","true","2.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

I can't say how much he has learned, but he has been earning stars left and right, with out our help!\n\nOne of the best educational games ("And fun" his words) we have tried, aside from ABC Mouse, and no subscription required!\n\nMy only issue is that I can't find the shut down from in-side the game (if it even exists). I have to alt-tab on my windows system to close the program. Still have not found a work around for his Ubuntu/Linux system though.\n\nUpdate:\nFinaly figured it out. Move the mouse to the bottom of the screen and leave it for a second or two. Some new "menus" will show up, one of them says exit.","September 10, 2015","true","4.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

This is a straight up educational game that does include point and click areas where objects react or come to life like any traditional Humongous Game. The main protagnogists are two shape shifting siblings named Ben & Becky Brightly who live in a colorful house that is almost equivelent to Pee-Wee's Playhouse minus the living furniture. Ben & Becky are like the Wonder Twins from the Superfriends series with character designs straight from an Archie comic. Most Humongous games would have an adventure element to them, this game however is just a series of mini games with no goal other than collecting smart stars that look like the stars used in the Mario Bros. universe. The only purpose the stars have is unlocking a space mini game that requires tons of stars to play. The game overall isn't bad, not a personal favorite in comparison to the other Humongous games but with the abundance of mini games it was far from being a complete lost. Since this is aimed towards a Kindergarten level audience it was intended for that age group and not to those over the age of 6. So it may make a good gift idea for someone who has a kid currently entering Kindergarten.","January 5","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
