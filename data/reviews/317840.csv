The levels consist of fairly short escort missions where you pave the way to be clear of obstacles for the AI princess. The puzzles are very fun and enjoyable but at times become very tedious and burdensome, and not because the puzzles themselves are difficult but due to the incompetent AI Princess that will always seem to walk herself into the absolute worst possible position. You will quickly grow to hate the princess you are trying to save as she walks right into the oncoming path of a block you have to push in order to complete a puzzle, this results in you crushing the princess and having to start over and over and over.\n\nThe game feels as if it has drawn inspiration from other games such as Ico and the “Murphy sections” of Rayman Legends. Another frustration of the game is there are no re-bindable keys…which wouldn’t be an issue if the default keys weren’t so obscure, you are forced to us A and D to move left and right and then greater than and less than signs to jump and attack, to make matters worse you are constantly being forced to alternate from the keyboard to the mouse to use perhaps the game’s most interesting and defining gameplay mechanic; your magic chalk powers, which allow you to complete puzzles by drawing chalk lines on the screen to create ropes and fuses that can be used to complete puzzles.\n\nEarly on in the game you are presented with another interesting gameplay mechanic; the ability to drink a potion and change from an undead demon to a living human prince for short periods of time, this adds a unique spin on how you handle the puzzles, as the prince it is easier to defeat enemies whoever you cannot jump even remotely as high as your undead counterpart, but as the prince you are able to carry the incompetent AI princess to safety during the many times she’s about to get herself killed.\n\nThe game does make use of its chalk art style… but more so as a cop out for some of the fairly poor character (and slightly laggy) animations that occur. These slight graphical hiccups are by no means game breaking as this is not a precision platformer by any means; however a bit more polish could have avoided this minor complaint all together. Overall the game is enjoyable and if you are in the mood for a fairly decent puzzle platformer with interesting gameplay mechanics and decent pacing then this game is definitely worth picking up for the asking price of $5.99.\n\n","December 12, 2014","true","1.6"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","19","19","0","0"

It's made by Game Arts, the people behind the Grandia and Lunar series. They're actually working on porting Grandia II to Steam right now, and if you like JRPGs I'd buy it when they finish, as I've heard it's very good. And if you like puzzle platformers you should get Dokuro, as it's a great game in that genre too.\n\nThe story is set in a non-descript fantasy kingdom, where the Dark Lord has just kidnapped the local Princess. With no hero around to stop him, it seems she's destined to a forced marriage - until the titular Dokuro, a lowly skeletal mook, decides she's a bit easier on the eyes than his current boss. He's sure to get more respect as a hero than his current position, right?\n\nWell, no. After releasing the Princess he's dismayed to find out not only is she not thanking him, she doesn't even notice he exists, literally. It's up to him and the player to change that by helping her get out of the castle, but it's a long way to the entrance.\n\nThe basic gameplay is that of an escort mission. Each level is one room of an area of the castle, such as the ballroom or kitchen, with a flower at the end. You need to get both Dokuro and the Princess to that flower alive, which isn't as easy as it sounds. Dokuro can jump over obstacles and defend himself, but she can't, and what's worse, her not noticing him means she'll gladly blunder into danger. Monsters will make her turn and run, but with hazards she can and will die. Thus most levels are based around making a safe path from point A to B for her to follow.\n\nDokuro has a few tricks to help with this, such as different kinds of chalk, befitting the game's graphical motif, that can create ropes to fix pulleys, light fires, or other effects. Early on he also gets a potion that lets him transform into a prince form, where he can pick up and carry the princess to get her away from danger or down ledges, as well as defeat monsters more easily. Almost all the levels feel well-designed, and while there are some hard ones it never gets to the point of being frustrating. Dokuro controls well, and it doesn't require pixel perfect movement.\n\nThe game looks quite nice, and the story, while simple, makes you care about since Dokuro is a believable underdog. It's also decently long: I think I'm only about halfway through it at the time of this review. If you were wary because of the Mixed review status, don't be: most of the negative ones aren't talking about the actual game, just that it lacks options that are unnecessary to enjoy it. I hope my review helps convince you it's worth your time, because it definitely is.","June 28, 2015","true","10.8"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

My first impression is really good, reminds to me games such as ICO, but obviously in other league like portable games. As a puzzle game is pretty well designed, but I must say an advice that a controller support is really desirable because you can't rebind the keys on keyboard... and you're force to play with keyboard&mouse doing things like jumping, attacking and writting with the pencil (mouse) and it is not really easy. On my keyboard's configuration is this:\n\n-A (left)\n-D (right)\n-Mouse left (pencil)\n-, (attack)\n-. (jump)\n-ç (prince's tranformation)\n-space (pause/options)\n\nAs you can see is not easy to play this, and controller will be better or at least a rebind of keys. But a long this, is a really good game.\n\nAnyway I bought the game for showing to Game Arts that here, on Steam, there are fans of his Lunar and Grandia franchises to support.\n\nEDIT 19/12/14: Well I'm on level 8 and I must recognize that this game is poor on controls because of not being possible to rebind keys and not support control pad. If you're not really good playing platforms, skip this game because you could not beat this game, sincerely.\n\nEDIT 27/12/14: I'm on level 12-7 right now. Sorry but NO. I can't recommend this game just because its poor porting quality of controls. They are really a madness pain experience to beat and get all coins and achievements. They have done a bad job by not let people play in control pad or at lesat, rebind the keyboard. Trust me, don't expend your money untill they fix it (probably never).\n\nEDIT after beat it: Ok, as I said is hard to recommend because of controls, but its puzzle games, its story very charming and its own art are really good. Pick this game on sale if you can afford a try harder with its controls.","December 8, 2014","true","21.4"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

I jumped in without knowing what to expect. Even from the title screen I could tell I was going to love it for the music and art style... and turned out that was all it took for me to get into the game. (I'm basically playing just for the game art, music and genre. And I'm loving it.)\n\nJust like other reviewers said though, the "Options" menu is incomplete for a PC game. In fact, to be honest, it feels like something that was ported from a PSP or GBA version sloppily. I myself had to spam all the keys on the keyboard before knowing that I press "." to jump, and "SPACE" to pause the game (lolwat).\n\nNot that I care though. I get to save a princess from Bowser. Good enough for me. :D","May 17, 2015","true","0.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Regardless of what the negative reviews say, this game does now indeed have partial controller support. And it states that outright that there is one feature that requires you use the mouse. The magic Chalk... It makes sense why there isn't controller support for this, though I suppose a method could be devised.\n\nThe graphics are very interesting and memorable. The story is rather cute and the sounds are entertaining. Very amusing puzzle platformer.\n\nWatch videos on the game, and if it appeals to you, then buy it.

It's a normal platformer and the art style in nice. The princess on the other hand is annoying in the sense she cant even walk down steps without your help. There is little to no voice acting, yet the message is still conveyed nicely. It's challenging enough where you can solve the puzzles after thinking for a day, but easy enough where you dont really need to look up the walkthrough online unless you really are stuck. All in all, good game especially for its price. Would say to get it on your phone though, cheaper and less buggy i hear.","February 15","true","22.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Honestly I really like how the game looks and  the mild story that it encompasses but I simply cannot get past these abominable controls. Case in point if your going to release a pc game atleast give use some options so we can atleast map our own controls. Having to use Joytokey to force controller support is not my idea of fun basic start up in a game as casual as this.","December 21, 2014","false","0.2"," 5 of 18 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","5","18","0","0"
