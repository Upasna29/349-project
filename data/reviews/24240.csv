"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DocSeuss/recommended/24240/","DocSeuss","DocSeuss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DocSeuss/","1983 products in account","I am fairly confident that Payday: The Heist is one of the best games I've ever played. At its heart, it's a cops and robbers game that feels a bit like Left 4 Dead, except instead of navigating on a linear path through multiple maps, you take control of and dominate a single map, and you only play as the robbers, not the cops. Featuring a diverse set of maps, a cool leveling system that encourages player experimentation and mobility, and generally just being amazing, Payday: The Heist is the single greatest co-op experience I've ever had. I think it's better than Left 4 Dead, to be quite honest.\n\nWould you like to know how many things I would change about the game?\n\nZero things. The answer is Zero things. Because there are Zero things I would change. Actually, come to think of it, I would change one thing: the game's leveling curve is a bit 'off,' and newer players have a harder time enjoying the game until about level twenty or so, but that's a problem easily solved. Oh, don't get me wrong, I'd totally be up for adding new features--maybe better stealth, more customized ammo, more maps with more unique behaviors, and stuff like that--but the fact is, the game is just pretty awesome as it is.\n\nYou can sprint sideways.\nYou can use fake dummy turrets to keep crowds down while you steal a man's blood in the PC-exclusive Mercy Hospital level.\nYou can sprint backwards.\nYou can spend thirty-three minutes drilling into a secret vault hidden away in the game's first level.\nYou can yell at Alex for being a terrible, terrible crane driver.\nYOU CAN SPRINT IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND THE BRENNER IS AMAZING AND THE STRYK IS LIKE PEW PEW PEW AND MY LOVE FOR THIS GAME IS SO INTENSE YOU DON'T EVEN...\n\nAll of the game's features work well together. Only one of the maps--Heat Street--is bad. It's a co-op game. It's not a solo game. You play with other people, and you'll have a blast. I've bought fifteen or twenty copies for friends now.\n\nEDIT: Hey, just because I've bought copies for friends doesn't mean I'm going to buy a copy for you. A) I can't afford to do this anymore, and B) if you're a person who friended me at random, why would you expect me to buy you a game?","November 26, 2013","true","78.8"," 769 of 854 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","769","854","0","27"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockoria/recommended/24240/","rockoria","Rockoria","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockoria/","264 products in account","Oh man, Payday: The Heist... This game carries so many memories for me. I know it's old, and the community isn't really all that active anymore, but this game still kicks ♥♥♥. Now, this isn't PAYDAY 2. You won't spend very much time devising plans or sneaking around (more on that later), but instead, you have a clear objective, and then you let all hell loose with some kickass weapons. So, is this game for you? But isn't PAYDAY 2 so much better? Well, let me break this down.\n\nIn general, PAYDAY 2 has a more "realistic" feel, with your characters movement and weapons being a little less arcadey, and more down to earth. Payday: The Heist is exactly the opposite, and it's still great. Characters are fast, weapons have dead point accuracy (most of the time, not always) and in general it's trying to make you feel as little vulnerability as possible. And although you could argue about which is better, there's no denying it feels pretty badass.\n\nAnother key difference is that one of PAYDAY 2's main selling points is that things within the heists switch around, making things more unique. The original lacks this in every single heist but one (which is my favourite, personally) and it does definitely wear on you after a while, however if your anything like me you'll play them again just because it's fun.\n\nI'm almost done with comparisons! Another big one is that outside of the beggining of two heists, there's no stealth, only guns blazing. So if your really into stealth, you'll probably prefer PAYDAY 2.\n\nAnd finally, the upgrade system. In PAYDAY 2, upgrading is quite complex. You have skill trees, even skill decks for bonuses, individual weapon upgrades, etc, making a very deep (albeit sometimes confusing) way to make your character powerful. The original streamlines this: All you have to do is pick which tree to advance in, and as you level up you get things from that tree (like weapons, perks, bonuses, etc.), with you being able to switch between trees at any time.\n\nSo that's it with comparisons. So how's the actualy game itself?\n\nIt's fast, furious, difficult, and just plain amazing. Assuming you get the Wolfpack DLC (which I highly reccomend) you have 4 skill trees, 9 heists, and all in all a ton of fun. I only have ONE WARNING: DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME ALONE! The AI is so stupid it's embarrasing. You can do it for bragging rights, or for practice, but this game needs to be played with other people, so get a team.\n\nRegarding the community, outside of Europe not that many people play it, so I suggest getting a 4-pack and playing it with friends.\n\nAnd that's my review! Hopefully you now understand which PAYDAY game is for you! (I reccomend getting both, if you can)\n\nFINAL SUMMARY:\nThis game, and it's sequel, are amazing. Fantastic gameplay, great dev's, and hours upon hours of fun. Just don't do it alone!","November 9, 2014","true","60.6"," 357 of 376 people (95%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","95","357","376","35","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/24240/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Payday: The Heist is a first person shooter game developed by Overkill Software and published by Sony Entertainment. The game was released in October 2011 on PC, after being released on PS3. The game is owned on Steam by over four million players due to its regularity being on sale.\n\nThe gameplay is based around completing heists with a party of four people including you. This can be done either in a single player environment, or up to 4 player co-op online. The heists can consist of the classic bank jobs, right the way to the complete extreme of extracting blood from a highly classified patient. You play the role of one of the four main characters in the game, Dallas, Chains, Wolf or Hoxton.  Each member of the team can use a variety of different weapons, you are able to select your load out before jumping into a heist, so once you get to know what is needed to be done on each heist, you can select what to use accordingly. Each of the missions starts off in a stealth style mission, where you have to disable security camera, turning off alarm systems etc. Whether you complete these tasks successfully or not without being seen will determine how the rest of the heist will carry out.  These starting missions are done really well, and you will be fully immersed since most of them have you sneaking around a pitch black building trying to out manoeuvre the guards. A lot of the missions also come with the added obstacle of civilians – these are crucial in any of the heists as you can keep them hostage and use them as bargaining trades should one of your other team mates be captured by the police too.\n\nWhilst you can spend a good portion of the game in stealth and hopefully not being noticed, a good portion of the game will also be spent with you going all guns blazing as you attempt to fend off an almost endless stream of enemy police and SWAT.  The gunplay in Payday really well done. All of the guns feel as powerful as you would expect, and the choice of weapons is pretty big when compared to other FPS games.  Ammo does become a problem with your primary weapon since you’ll be shooting this off constantly at points, but can be easily countered by the abundance of pickups of ammo off dead enemies.\n\nEven though Payday is almost four years old at this point, it is still a really good looking game, especially when you ramp up the resolution to 4k. Originally I thought the game was made using the Source engine due to the familiarities in the graphics with the likes of Half Life 2 and Left 4 Dead, but the game is made using an engine called Diesel (made by GRIN, who are now defunct unfortunately). There are a couple of textures which are very low resolution which is a shame, but I can forgive this a bit given that a lot of the levels are actually fairly big, so this must have been done to reduce the need for loading screens.  The game has a really good ragdoll simulation too, when you are mowing down the enemies, they don’t just die in a normal fall to the floor fashion, each death is individually animated depending on where/how they were shot, which adds to the originality slightly.\n\nPayday is fully voice acted and done really well at that; the game is almost narrated by what seems to be someone behind the scenes instructing your team on what to do next on the heist. You’ll get remarks back from the rest of the team in responses to objectives being completed and you’ll also get a lot of radio chatter when you are in firefights with the police too.\n\nThis is a really hard game. The first couple of heists come with the option to play them on easy mode; these must really be the games tutorial since they can be completed without any real problems; yet once you reach the third or fourth mission, the difficulty takes a big ramp up and you’ll actually find yourself either failing missions from not completing objectives, or because you have died or been taken into custody. I had to replay each of the last few stages of the game multiple times before I was able to successfully complete the heists. Even though the ramp in difficulty felt really harsh at the time; I began to enjoy the game even more because of it; because it’s not just as simple as a “get in and out” job, it forces you to plan your every move, and you will tread with caution around every corner because of the unknown ambush that awaits you. The game also has another two difficulty levels to be played on, Hard and overkill mode – these are modes which should not even be considered when playing on single player because you will not stand a chance. I tried the overkill mode out and it is just absolute carnage. I will definitely be asking friends to join in a game to give this mode a proper try out.\n\nWhilst all of the missions have the same key objective, and there is really only one way to complete said objective, it can lead to a little repetitive gameplay. The game does however try to counteract that by adding a little bit of randomness into the stages by shaking things up a bit; such as locations the locations of key civilians that you need to keep hostage, meaning you still have to go searching through the whole building to find them rather than rushing to the one place. Each of the levels has some form of random element to it which is nice to see, since you will be playing the same six or seven heists over and over again.\n\nI have put about twenty hours into Payday: The Heist so far and see no end in sight for it at the moment. There is still a really active multiplayer scene if you want to just find pick up groups with randommers, but I would highly recommend playing this with a bunch of friends on Skype to get the full experience out of it. The added levels of difficulty also adds plenty of replay ability too; meaning you will not run out of interesting content for a long while with this title. The game does have one piece of DLC which includes new weapons and two new heists, which is a worthwhile piece of DLC.\n\nThe game is also extremely technically sound too; I was able to play on 4k resolution with all of the graphic options maxed out and I was still able to hit the heights of 160 FPS, so this is one of the best optimized games out there at the moment.  Keyboard and mouse is recommended to play with, given the FPS nature.\n\nOverall, Payday: The Heist is an extremely good game; one that I am surprised it has taken me so long to play, and one that I will certainly be keeping installed on my machine because of the high replay ability factor. The game is also very cheaply priced at £10,99 – but like I said at the start, the game is always going on sale, and most of the time it is for 90% off; at that price, is it an absolute no brainer to pick it up – you may as well pick up the four pack for yourself and friends whilst you are at it.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

And now it's one of my favorite games. Even though PAYDAY 2 is out and I find that game really fun, I still come back to this game because the 2 games have 2 different play styles. PAYDAY 2 is more realisic and strategic, while PAYDAY 1 feels like it's more Left 4 Dead or Mass Effect 3 multiplyer. It also feels more fast paced, sending larger waves of enemies in maps that offer poor cover causing the player to use their unlimited sprint, and 0 reduction on your speed due to the armor you must wear to survive, to dodge and return fire on maps that contain both close and long range encounters. Both of the PAYDAY games are on my list of best games I've ever played.\n\nI highly recommend these games.","November 28, 2013","true","84.2"," 85 of 97 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","85","97","0","3"

Imagine more like Killing Floor where playing the game gives you progress  on each class. You can grind it out to get there faster, but that'll go against what the game's pushing you towards.\n\nPeople say it's comparable to Payday 2 in that they're the same characters and world, etc. They're wrong. The game is paced completely differently: heists aren't meant to be quick in-and-out situations, they're long, gruelling marathons you have to push through. They also don't function on an "all or nothing" reward system. If you fail right at the end, that's okay, you still get money (experience) for every objective you completed along the way. It's not as rage inducing as ♥♥♥♥ing up a Big Bank stealth right as you're opening the vault, then having to run and get the god damn drill because alarms went off.\n\nThat's another thing, there's not really stealth save for one or two missions. Don't be a ♥♥♥♥in' ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥. When you ask yourself "Are we rushin' in, or are we goin in sneakypeaky like?", the answer should always be the former. Stealth in this game is a lot harder, and it's more of a dickwaving contest kind of situation when you can stealth the few maps, rather than being the optimal strategy necessarily.\n\nOverall, it's worth picking up even if you have Payday 2. It's not like the Left 4 Dead series in the regards that L4D2 replaces the 1st in every way, they're just completely different games with different mechanics.","October 16, 2014","true","12.1"," 70 of 87 people (80%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","80","70","87","7","3"

It goes on sale for five dollars at least four times a year, and then you'll probably be able to grab the Wolf Pack for 99 cents, which is almost necessary to feel like you got the full game.\n\nIf you've played Payday 2, I need to warn you that the two games are fundamentally similar, but that's where it stops.  Payday:The Heist does not have as many mechanics as Payday 2; you will always be a speedy, slightly tanky glass cannon who is in danger of running out of ammo and must take cover to survive prolonged assaults. But this gives the game a tension and skill ceiling that really augments the gameplay.\n\nPayday:The Heist is much more scripted than Payday 2; in general you are playing the heists the way the developers intended and some may find that repetitive. But the heists are SO MUCH BETTER than in Payday 2! Nothing in Payday 2 comes close to the sheer creativity and versatility of what every heist in Payday:The Heist throws at you. It's very tough to get bored when a single heist involves you visiting a hospital, restraining all the civilians, impersonating doctors, breaking into quarantine, drawing and purifying blood samples, restarting the power to get the elevator working, crashing into the morgue and commandeering an ambulance for the escape.\n\nIt's really a kickass game and you're missing out if you don't try it.","July 14, 2015","true","192.9"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","35","36","3","0"

Deadcops doesn't quite tickle the same area of the brain that gets turned on by expert planning and execution, it's still a pretty rewarding co-op experience with loads of personality.

I certainly didn't expect that this game would be fun even after 1k hours. Admittedly this game has lots of flaws, but in part that's what makes it such a great game. The random elements in the game, spawns, enemy pathing and to a lesser extend the objectives, make the game unpredictable and failure is always around the corner. Unlike some Co-op PvE games out there, you actually have to play tactical and watch your HP (using "shoot and cover") to complete the heists on the higher difficulties (and for beginners even on the lower ones). Failing to do so will get you punished (although you can get away with it to some extend when playing with a VERY good team) and in all likeliness gets your character killed.\n\nBesides the satisfaction of beating the game on the highest difficulties with a good team, you can basically make it as hard on yourself as you want. If the default difficulties aren't enough, install DorHUD and play on an even higher difficulty with even more spawns (and yes, this makes a huge difference). Seeing all those helmets flying is a reason to keep playing the game and there's always room for improvement: more kills per minute, better accuracy, fewer downs, faster completion of the heist or just competing to be the best in the stats at the end of the heist when playing with other players, which can make for incredibly fun games ;).\n\nThe only downsides of this game is the crappy bots (although this can be seen as a factor that makes the game harder) and the fact that there are quite a few cheaters. As a programmer and creator of (an attempt of) an anticheat module (+more), DorHUD, it's actually part of the challenge to find ways to beat the cheaters or at least expose them.\n\nSince this is a review, maybe I should mention that it's worth even its full price. On sale it's only €2.48 (€3.47 with the soundtrack DLC that gives you an extra set of masks and some awesome music). It's rougly the price of one glass of beer, but you can play this game for a lot longer than you can enjoy that beer. You can even play this game after having drunk lots of beers (or vodka, if you prefer that).","December 23, 2015","true","931.0"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","34","36","8","3"

The game brings you to every detail of heist, from entering target facility to escaping the police if necessary, which can be very tricky.\n\nI enjoyed FPS side of the game, shooting a lot of cops, whose raids are really common and after a while you will be surprised how many police forces are in the city ready to dying trying a heist of 4 robbers. On the other side defence is not a problem at all, the difficulties start with a lack of ammo - that's what I suppose as the biggest obstacle.

Every level is about a heist - you go in, you grab the money and you get out. In the meantime, dozens (if not hundreds) of cops are hurled against you. The 4 of you must work together to survive the level.\n\nEvery level has sections. You always have to do something before you can advance. For instance, you are in a hospital where your job is to steal blood samples. However, in order to proceed to the section of the special patients you need to cut through a door with a saw. These machines usually require activation. Still, you need to remain close by to see if they stop so that you can start them up again.The waves of enemies get more frequent and dangerous. Same goes for the bank mission: you cut through the safe, but oh wait, you need some thermite to be able to enter the vault.\n\nPayday is one of those games where if you complete the levels you have pretty much seen everything. BUT! You have new weapons and other equipment to unlock once you level up. This so-called reputation level goes up till 193 and the higher level you are the more money you need to achieve the next level.\n\nEssentially, the replayability goes along the road Killing Floor has. Higher levels make you stronger (due to the new equipment) so you are able to pick a higher difficulty and replay the heists once more. Or die trying as this game is VERY difficult. Even on normal difficulty you will sweat to see the end of the road. And then you have at least 200 achievements waiting to be unlocked. :)\n\nPAYDAY is a fun game. If you have a lot of time on your hands and you like "farming" this is for you.\n\n","September 29, 2014","true","6.1"," 44 of 58 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","44","58","3","2"

Payday essentially takes the gameplay elements from Left Four Dead and instead of a zombie setting, the game has a crime mob atmosphere\n\nThis game has been compared by the trolls as a "Left 4 Dead clone," which is horribly false. It actually does have some reliable comparisons about each games'\n\nThe premise of this game is great.\nYou get to embark on only six various heist missions and complete different tasks.\n\nYou get to play with four of your Co-op friends and there is plenty of teamwork and coordination involved.\n\nHowever, this game is insanely unbalanced.There's almost an infinite enemy respawn, There is a ton of upgrades for instance, which comprise new guns, less recoil, better accuracy, more damage, better armor, mines, new accessories, cuffs, etc\n\nYou can also take up to three hostages (for each member of your team, unless you exchange your ammo bag for three cuffs). But you cannot even move these hostages, you basically place them on the ground, tie them up and pray that the cops won't get to them, because if they do, the time for negotiation and your subsequent release from custody gets extended beyond 3 minutes. And let me tell you, once one of your team members gets caught, there is very little chance that the other 3 members will be able to hold out for the entire 3 minutes. So the whole hostage thing is moot, just ignore them, or kill them so they don't get in the way\n\nEvery frustration that I have described so far has to do with normal difficulty. I cannot even imagine what's it like playing on Hard or Overkill\n\nI honestly have no idea what the devs were thinking with this game. Why throw that many suicidal cops and swat team members? It is so unrealistic. All they do is use smoke occasionally, send in one member with a shield or taser gun. They basically make suicidal attacks like the Japanese in WW2, so you get to mow them down and get shot at the same time. When you get shot at, your screen jerks around, your aim gets messed up and your screen gets red - the typical FPS tricks\n\nll they had to do was lessen the amount of enemies, make enemies harder to kill, make mini tasks more interesting and add a fluid cover system. However, most of the mini tasks that you need to complete do not have any meaningful cover available, so you basically run around like an idiot and try to kill as many enemies as possible\n\nOverall: The game basically crosses over the line many times over where the frustrations pile up and it's not fun anymore.  The game gets repetitive and tedious pretty fast. other than that. multiplayer is fair enough but it gets boring after a while.","August 8, 2013","true",""," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","3"

True! The conversation in game went something like this...\n\nKyzka: So what you do for work?\nCpt Bob: I'm a cop in real life.\nKyzka: What? Seriously?\nCpt Bob: Yeah.\nKyzka: Isn't that like living a double life or something? A cop playing a video game where your a bad guy that kills cops for a living...\nCpt Bob: It depends, I view it more as im in training learning all the things I should not do.\nKyzka: Is that why your forever in donut shops?\nCpt Bob: Exactly we try our best to arrive several days after the incident that way this sort of killing cop thing never happens...\n\nIn game Cops pretty much arrive in waves the millisecond you start to look at someone the wrong way. Just like Payday 2 there are special enemies in the way of tasers, cloakers, shields, bulldozers and snipers that spawn in frequently to stop you from getting your pay dirt. However unlike payday 2 the special enemies often act quite differently. For instance Bull dozers move much more faster than they do in payday 2, though they don't have as much health, still if you get shot twice from them its more often than not 'man down'. Tasers will often come in pairs and strike instantly. Cloakers have no  warning sound that they are close by and most of the time will pounce on you when your trying to interact with something or someone. Shields other than the Gl40, there is no other gun which can penetrate their shield. Forget your Gl40 and the only answer left is to quickly try and flank them. Snipers in the droves are undoubtedly the worst. Everytime I try the level undercover on 145+ I openly weep when I'm informed i have to go to the roof.\n\nThe second biggest difference between this and Payday 2 is that ALL the maps are LOUD. None of them are 'True' stealth. Granted 'Diamond Heist' can be done stealthily on the easier levels, but try it on 145+ and its all guns blazing again. Sadly the stealth side of things was never properly instituted in this version of payday and so playing as a pacifist would never be a real option most of the time. There are only 9 maps in total with four different difficulty settings with 145+ being the hardest. (This is not including the fact that someone has created a mod which creates a 193+ level for those that love to experience sheer pain).\n\nThe developers Overkill have finished with the game and have moved all their focus on Payday 2 even recreating the same levels from this one to there. So most people ask the obvious question, 'Why bother to play PAYDAY the Heist?'\n\n1) For the experience. SInce both the skill tree and the special enemies react differently there is a much more rewarding experience in the level of difficulty fighting in comradery with three other team mates against the relentless sheer hell of countless waves in this one than you might experience in Payday 2. Since all capped 193 players have the same instruments at each others disposal its all about game play and team work. Have one person acting alone and its probably game over for the whole team. This game is so much harder, that ive actually seen people who have spent 5,000 hrs plus be taken out within seconds by a cloaker or a taser. Having said that the game also offers fewer enemies for those that try each map solo without bots. This has given rise to the gauntlet of challenges of die hard fans to attempt the fool hardy of attempt of showing off their skills as they venture alone. Here is an example of two professionals who have raised to that challenge...\n\nhttps://youtu.be/R4MNDlzqRJk\n\nhttps://youtu.be/KjExnQ5p4ME\n\n2) The history of the Original secret vault and what gamers had to do to get there is a rich part of gaming history to attempt it yourself is a 'must do' for any serious gamer out there . Here is a video explaining it all in detail...\n\nhttps://youtu.be/j7nFAURAGEM?list=PLv2Qcu6n6_mI9QeFdDv_xDSe5WL-6Pusl\n\nSo basically first you need to do all the heists on 145+ to get the golden mask. Then play the first world bank with three other people each wearing a golden mask standing in your respective positions, next you will have a 2hr constant onslaught of the hardest enemies  while you wait for the drill to get through. Only to be confronted by another room which requires a correct code to be entered into the floor tiles to avoid being gassed to death. Then you will get rewarded with one of the most beautiful vaults you will ever see. Some even claim that sending the video of the above the adventure to Overkill will result with you getting a special secret mask.\n\n3) Another challenge I would recommend is the doing the last level 'No Mercy' Loud all the way on 145+, there are no achievments for this challenge, the reward is simply knowing the fact that you have done the hardest level, on the hardest difficulty, the hardest way.\n\nThe Payday Story stops abruptly and hints towards left for dead more than it does Payday 2. It honestly feels that something is missing like a payday 1.5 maybe?\n\nTrue there are plenty of Trolls, Hackers and Noobs in this game just like there is in Payday 2. True there are only 9 levels to grind away at constantly reaching the coveted 193 level, but its the level of difficulty and the constant dedication of the professional players which remain behind throwing out challenges and helping new ones that can make this game a really rewarding experience and a thumbs up.\n\nIn final it is a great game to vent off some steam if you ever get a speeding fine, Thanks Overkill.

Payday: The Heist. If you want a game that actually challenges you and focuses on team play, then grab this gem. With only 1 DLC ever made (excluding the in game soundtrack), this is a true video game, not a DLC fest, like Payday 2 has become.\n\nThis is a straightforward team based shooter with no strings attached and has some similiar game mechanics of Left 4 Dead. It is a game where you must work hard as a team or die as a team! It is an unforgiving game and the challenges become harder as you progress, until you get to the dreaded Overkill 145+ difficulty, which is much harder than the Deathwish on Payday 2.\n\nIn this game, you do not have Skills, Perk Decks, Armror or fancy weapons (RPGs) at your disposal. Because of the lack of these things, you will need to work hard and be smart with your team, to overcome the Overkill 145+ achievements.\n\nThe only negative is finding a team to play with. There is only a very small amount of people who play this (probably a maximum of 300 people online at any one time). But there is plenty Payday The Heist groups and of course the forum is still reasonably active. There will always be someone out there to help you, if you don't have friends to play with.\n\nSo what does this mean for you? Well, go Steal, Kill and make a Deal, in the best Payday game made.\n\nPros:\n-Original concept, before it got ruined in Payday 2\n-Very team focused game play\n-Very challenging experience\n-No DLC every month\n-No micro-transactions\n-No cross-overs (with game or film companies)\n-No large downloads every month (2gigs or more, are standard updates in PD2)\n\nCons:\n-Small amount of players (this can be over come by finding groups / forums to get a team)\n-Game can lag a lot more than Payday 2 (especially if your team is from around the world)\n-Some minor bugs in game, that will probably never be repaired\n\nI give this game 4 out of 5 Beers.\n\nCheers,\nFrost","March 25","true","87.6"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","4"

A pulsating background score, tense entry and setup sequences, interspersed with absolute chaos once the heist is underway, make this probably one of the best Heist games ever made.\n\nCampaign | Gameplay: Released by Overkill Software / Sony Entertainment in 2011, the game consists of 7 Heists that can be played in Single-player or Co-op mode, with an additional 2 Heists available as DLC. Gamers choose to play as one of the four main protagonists – Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf or Chains – each a specialist in his own area of Heavy Weapons, Explosives, Engineering/Tech, and Sniper/Support. Each heist also consists of a series of sub-objectives – which may include locating a key target (such as a bank manager), gaining access to restricted locations, destroying surveillance footage etc. Additionally, the fact that components of these sub-objectives will randomly spawn in various locations on the map ensures that no two playthrough’s of a particular heist are exactly alike - a major bonus to the overall replayability of this title. While playable in Single-player mode (supported by 3 AI controlled bots), the game absolutely shines in Multiplayer / Co-op where each member of your 4-man crew is a different player. Obviously, the quality of your experience and ultimate success of the heist will depend on the experience of your crew – but being part of a well drilled team provides an adrenaline rush that few other games will match.\n\nFlaws: In considering its shortcomings (and there are a few) – Lack of a single player campaign, short overall length (limited to 7 Heists), average graphics, somewhat clunky K&M controls (/no controller support), text-based UI, and an overall experience targeted at a narrow cross-section of the gaming community, you might think this is a game to pass on. But,… what it does, it does brilliantly well – and the thrill of running through a heist with a top-notch crew who work together, seamlessly combine to complete objectives, cover each other’s backs and take scores is something well worth the experience.\n\n‘Payday: The Heist’ ultimately succeeds as an homage to the great heist flicks of the past – it’s slick, fast-paced, offers a good variety of heists, and is supported by a phenomenal soundtrack. Robert de Niro (in ‘Heat’) tells it like it is: “We do what we do best – Take Scores. You do what you do best – Try to stop guys like us”. Strongly Recommended for Online Co-op / with Friends! – Rated (7.9/10)\n\n\nWant More Recommendations?\nClick the 'Follow' button on our Curator Page (Link Attached) to get the latest reviews updated directly onto your Activity Feed.

First of all, DO NOT compare this game with PAYDAY 2, that game is newer than this and has been improved and upgraded a lot.\n\nPAYDAY: The Heist lets you play as 4 criminal named Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains in their criminal career, executing heist from robbing a bank, street chase, into breaking a hospital for something. It's not as easy as blazing your way inside as sometimes you have to make an entrances by drilling or blowing while defending yourself against police and SWAT assault in their attempt to arrest you. As you play, you will level up and get upgrades for your characters and weapons. PAYDAY: The Heist also lets you play cooperatively up-to 4 players.\n\nPAYDAY: The Heist has very decent graphics and effects. The Characters Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains has very great detail on them, and the police has many variant too which also affect the gameplay. The performances is also great, no problems at all, nothing broken.\n\nIf you compare PAYDAY: The Heist with PAYDAY 2, PAYDAY The Heist is a game before PAYDAY 2, like many games with a sequel, the sequel are supposed to be better than the previous right? So don't compare them.\n\nOverall PAYDAY: The Heist is a good game, especially when you can play with your friends, 4 of them. It's harder to play this game alone in singleplayer, just try to find some friends or buy 4 pack.

That said, it is not without flaws. The stealth system is not entirely as great as in Payday 2, but that's pretty much all I can think of at the moment.\n\nThe progression is decent, giving you new guns and abilities over time while giving you plenty of gametime to unlock it all. You can choose what general direction to unlock things in on leveling up, and things unlock at a steady pace that doesn't leave you grinding for levels just so you can play as you prefer. All in all, it's well made and works fine.\n\nThe gameplay itself is pretty good, with cover playing an important part and no enemy feeling unfair or like an unreasonable bulletsponge. It makes sure that almost every thing you're doing is of importance, with a good pace where sometimes it is tense and other times you can take a breather. It feels like you're always doing something, whether its rejoining your group, running from cover to cover, or taking out a few special units. Somehow the drill jams less than in Payday 2 as well.\n\nOf course it's not all bad, the AI is just good enough to work, and the hordes of cops make you sometimes feel like you're playing L4D with cops instead of zombies, zombies with guns. There are surprisingly few negatives to Payday The Heist.\n\nOverall, it's a bit old, but it's still great. I'd even say better than its sequel. And with regular sales it's easy to grab some friends and go heisting. If the regular price tag is not worth it to you, a sale will probably start soon.","November 27, 2015","true","15.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","1"

You have already bought it and..you see the greeting – “Support Overkill!”. You bought the PayDay for $5, that’s cool but this is not a complete game. You need to buy the DLC for $3.50 and then you'll have access to all the content that you have purchased.\n\nSo..\n+ nice graphics, addictive gameplay, leveling skills (3 main branches + 1 of the DLC) gives access to new equipment and weapon sight;\n+The missions will not bother;\n+ Exciting achievements;\n+ Voice chat, which is rarely used;\n+ Single-player, Multi-player with the possibility of switching on and off bots;\n\n- Developers have left the crude game with frequent bugs;\n- Sometimes lost connection to the host in Multi-player;\n\n\nOf course , the game is worth the money, but not the work of developers, which is still in an abandoned development stage.\nThat's why I don't advise to buy the game at full prise.\nWait for the discounts, gentlemen! :)\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nВ меню игры вас приветствует надпись - "Поддержите Overkill!". Вы купили PayDay за 349 рублей, это здорово! Но тут вам сообщают, что, к сожалению, вы купили игру не полностью. Заплатите еще 249 рублей и вы получите доступ ко всему контенту, который уже приобрели. То есть..будьте готовы отдать 600 рублей, если хотите полную игру.\n\nТеперь о главном, основные минусы и плюсы игры:\n+ Затягивающие миссии (имею в виду сами карты) и ачивки, на которых вы просидите часами и не заработаете ге-моррой\n+ Одиночная игра и Многопользовательская. Боты отключаются.\n+ Вы не услышите визг детей или матюги пьяницы\n+ Прокачка навыков (3 основные ветки + 1 из дополнения), открывающая доступ к новому снаряжению и оружию. То есть вы не получаете все и сразу..вы плавно развиваетесь, играя.\n\n- Разделение игры на Игру и DLC (четвертая ветка навыка и несколько карт, которые в PayDay изначально, без купленного дополнения, помечены, как "Недоступные").\n- Баги это нормально, для любой игры. Но в данном случае разработчики забросили свое творение и им, кажется, плевать. На все плевать.\n- Бывают вылеты - потеряно соединение, либо у  вас (если вы подключились), либо у тех, кто с вами играет (если вы хост). Это порядком мешает и вызывает трудности в зарабатывании некоторых достижений и выполнении начатой миссии в целом.\n- Завышенная цена за незаконченный проект\n\nИтак..Сырая баговая игра, от которой можно получить нереальное удовольствие, если закрыть глаза на то, что\n1) разработчикам откровенно н*ср*ть, как на игру, так и на тех, кто в нее играет\n2) вы не увидите света белого, пока не пройдете все и не заработаете все, что только можно\n3) 600 рублей за один, несправедливо заброшенный, баг\n\nИгра, несомненно, своих денег стоит, но не заброшенная, в сыром виде, работа раздработчиков.\nЖдите скидок, господа. :)","March 17","true","70.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","7","7","3","0"

I always felt that a tutorial would greatly serve PD, introduce you more intimently with the enemies and Special units and their weaknesses.\n-Hackers.  Are everywhere.  But if you are dying to find honest heisters, check out the Payday the Heist Online sub on Reddit!\n\nPros\n-THIS GAME IS HARD.    And I love it.  While I feel its a shame it doesn't have a tutorial, this game pretty drops you directly in the frey and expects you figure it out.  It makes every heist a hard earned victory, and a vigorous one at that\n-For whatever heisters remain, its generally a very supportive community\n-A DLC expansion pack that is a true bang for your buck.  Hoenstly one of the best DLC packs I've ever bought\n-Fantastic atmosphere!  Each of the heists stand out for a variety of reasons, and its easy to tell them aprt.\n\nVerdict\n\nIt's 15 bucks.  You're not losing much, and its some of the most fun I've played online!\n\n\nOVERDRAWN, SOAP BOX PREACHY SEGMENT:\n\n\n\n\nStory Pretty much none.  Most of, if not all the missions you play in this game are extremely isolated and I like that, very much.  The base story is that you, and three of your friends are proffesional bank robbers taking on the biggest and most elaborate hits.  Ranging some simple bank heists, to raiding a panic room for cash, to even stealing blood from a patient in a hospital.  While the mission total is short, (With the games expansion pack only offering an additonal two) there can only be around 9 heists.  But the RNG makes for great staying power.\n\nMechanics/Engine\nPAYDAY: The Heist is  of the two, one of the more grounded games.  It knows its engines limitations, and is sparing with the spectacles.  PAYDAY 2 on the other hand, is a much more... Outstanding game.  With PAYDAY: The Heist, you are only able to go loud for a majority of the missions, or heists.  Only one two can be stealthed, by not fully.  Working in horde based siege modes, there are four phases to a mission:\n\nCasing: You and the crew are just casing the joint.  Taking in security previsions, placements and looking for objectives\n\nAnticipation: The heist has just gone loud.  The police have just showed up, and it's about to go down.\n\nAssault:The police will, in favor of tacticallly approching your arrest, will instead besiege the area with armed forces.  Overwhelimg your defensives, on the higher difficulty.  They have a tendancy to really throw down the gauntlet.\nControl: This is the phase where the police pull a tactical withdrawl.  Though only briefly.  You use this time, to med-up and restock.  In certain cases, trade allies from custody.\n\n\nMusic\nThis is, where the PAYDAY series has always managed to impress.  The Soundtrack, compased by Simon Viklund, then Overkill's inhouse music producer and dialogue director, impresses as always with a booming soundtrack.  While the songs can not be interchanged, like in PD2, they are much more tied into the heist you're playing.","April 16","true","83.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

However, once you've put in some time and level up, you become better able to survive and succeed. The game's general tempo is great, you're running around on this map constantly under pressure from the police, and periodically they'll send in tougher waves with special enemies like the "Bulldozer" (a super-armored SWAT trooper), "Shield" (a trooper with a riot shield, naturally), and "Cloaker" (a stealthy spec-ops type).\nThere are three "classes" in the game: assault, sharpshooter, and support. While the difference between them is at first only the guns they use, as you complete missions you'll level up each class and earn more benefits. However, there's not really a system where you pick and choose your benefits: it's straight up "higher level = better", with no balances at all.\nOne major aspect of the game's "crime" theme is the hostage concept. Civilians litter each level; shooting them causes police to act more aggressively, but they can be shouted down and zip tied to be used as hostages. If a player-character is caught by the police, they can be traded for a hostage, so in a sense hostages act as "extra lives". However, the police will also be trying to rescue the hostages, so maintaining control of them is critical.\n","December 9, 2015","true","42.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The setting is just right, the game mechanics are there, and the music is top notch.   I remember buying it because of one thing, dynamics.   The conditions in a heist, will change.  From small things like location of items or chance of extra loot to spawn, to something larger like an entire room full of cash.   The feel of the game is there and the change in the game itself make it feel fresh, even after dozens of play troughs.   Also, there are different forms of "heists" in the game.   Most are simply "go in and grab money/items" but others are "escort person from A to B", but don't let that "A to B" analogy fool you in thinking it it easy *cough* Green Bridge *cough*.\n\nAnyway, this is just a great game to play either solo or with friends.  The only down side would be that the number of people playing it, has gone down but it is a tough yet entertaining game.  There are a few minor features here and there that are a pain, and are improved in Payday 2, but the vast majority of the game features, are all here.   Even the DLC is very well done and I HIGHLY recommend buying it as well.","December 24, 2013","true","115.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Is has some servers connections issues which are pretty annoying.\n\nI reccommend this game to everyone who wanna play and have some fun with friends.\n8/10","November 29, 2013","true","13.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

I got the game while it was free and I'm glad I did. A fun game where you play as one of four members of a group which robs banks and conducts other similar heists. Playing with friends is highly recommended as you will either bask in glory when you all finish that perfect bank job or yell and curse at that one guy who won't help you back up. You start off with basic weapons and skills, but these are upgraded when heists are completed, objectives are achieved, et cetera. You will find yourself constantly replaying First World Bank because it's the only one where you have a chance of finishing, but the missions are also randomised a slightly different way each time you play them.\n\nIf you consider buying this game but end up going for Payday 2 instead, try and get this during a sale. The assault waves in Payday 2 are still strong, but it always seems like the cops never leave you alone in this. If you get to a stage where you find Payday 2 is too easy for you, come to this. It is still a very fun and challenging game with friends and that is what keeps me playing it.","November 17, 2014","true","46.5"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

The game plays from the first person perspective, but offers a few twists on the standard FPS formula. Killing civilians is punished, instead players may take a limited number as hostages. Should any player get arrested (after taking enough damage and not being 'revived' in time) during the heist, one of his teammates may release a hostage, allowing a trade to take place which allows a single player to be released. While playing the levels, players will notice a lot of variation in a single level, as there are often a large number of random events programmed in. An example of this is the location of the bank manager in First World Bank.\n\nThe game focuses on four robbers (Dallas, Hoxton, Chains, and Wolf) who team up. Their first heist took place at the First World Bank, where they entered a vault by using thermite hidden on the inside of a photocopier and stole a large amount of money. A post-game message congratulates the group, telling them that they are "set for life", but recommends more heists, including robbing drug junkies in an abandoned apartment complex and ambushing a prisoner transport in heavy rain weather, simply for the enjoyment of the players.","January 12, 2014","true","51.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","8","10","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sandra_afrika/recommended/24240/","sandra_afrika","Lars Alexandersson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sandra_afrika/","244 products in account","So, this is a COOP game from 2011, but since half of these reviews are slow as ♥♥♥♥, I decided to come back and reveal yet another game from the dephts of the past years. I present to you, PAYDAY: The Heist.\n\nThis game is ♥♥♥♥ ass fun with friends, and not that good when playing solo. PAYDAY: The Heist's synopsis involves 4 professional guys robbing picked out heists. When I first started this game, I was given the benefit of the doubt in thinking that this will be some crappy indie game, even more doubt when I found out the company, Overkill Software, was formed from the directors of GRIN, whom is responsible for one of the worst, most generic games ever made, EVER. I was wrong.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nNow, the game doesn't have those top-notch graphics we see, it ponders more to the gameplay, but this section isn't left out. Everything, from the First World Bank, to the No Mercy hospital is enriched in detail, and complexity. Low-res textures are, as much as they can, removed and only when you are some detail-nut who likes to notice things. The game doesn't offer that much of a linear chance, but everything is complex and well-made. There are also some visual filter stuff in the menu I don't use. Bloom ♥♥♥♥, while appearing at some points of a heist, is not excessive and appears only for added realism. All-in all, graphics are pretty good.\n\nSOUND\n\nThe sounds, while not perfectly executed, give some needed environments the buff they need. Civilians screaming in terror are probably the most thought out, but the guns don't sound great. For example, the cops shooting their pistol sounds pretty ♥♥♥♥ing weak. And when huge firefights occur, the gun sounds just take a huge ♥♥♥♥ and leave, because everything is just said gun sounds, no bullets whizzings or anything. Doesn't give that much of a scenery if you ask me. The music makes up for it though. It's a mix of rock and electronic, and gives you that adrenaline pump when you need it. Bass rapes the songs at times, but it's still executed to pump you even more.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nNow here is the best part of the game. It really gives it it's substance. You and your buddies go on heists that are picked for you. Prediction is eliminated at this point, because every situation occurs RANDOMLY, and requires you and your team to pick out your loadouts carefully. At the start, you are bestowned with the option to scout out ahead and mark out the plan, which doesn't give the game that immediate action build like the mainstream concurence now-a-days. The only drawback I have on this heisting system is how unreal it is. Seriously, you get like 5000 SWAT officers shoved up your ♥♥♥. WHERE the ♥♥♥♥ do they find this kind of firepower? I am drilling the vault, and a great bunch of police officers appear at an Assault wave ready to buttrape you. Of course, this is all for an intended challenge, but really? You're gonna bring the whole America down on my ♥♥♥? Once you start the heist, you can use the F key to shout at stupid ♥♥♥ civilians who don't listen to you. They also managed to sucessfully find some use out of the keyboard key. You can use that to make officers cuff themselves, mark out special units, and do a ♥♥♥♥♥on of other things. It's amazing how much use one button can do here. Most of the gameplay involves drills and saws that are required, so it may get tedious for you, but the replayability and different scenarios excuse for it it, and gives it more interest the more you play. The A.I, unfortunatley, sucks balls when you play solo, but it can be perfectly understood because this is a CO-OP game and not designed only for you (if in that case you have no friends, ♥♥♥♥♥♥). The game also warrants defending your backs. If you go alone to find some object or ♥♥♥♥, you can guarantee you'll be in custody, unless you're pretty sure you can handle the cops. It's all about thinking and planning everything out as a team. You get a HUGE arsenal for things to prep yourself up too. Silenced UZIs, pistols, 2 shotguns, assault rifles and so much more. If you're a gun-nut, you'll love it. I had some added problems with the difficulties, because it's just police spam all around, and basically redefines the whole meaning of difficult. You need to SERIOUSLY prep up and have some firepower to finish a mission on the highest difficulty. This difficulty is somewhat lowered when the music from earlier kicks in during an Assault wave for adrenaline, and also the added cash, to remind your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ that you have a million bucks waiting for you to roll in.\n\nSTORY\n\nThere is no story for the game, but it has a synopsis. Basically, 4 guys (a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, a Sheffield guy, American and a Swedish) gather around and eventually meet some hacker/whatever called Bain. From then on, it's straight heisting. My favourite guy is Hoxton, the British ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThis game is what CO-OP should be. While it has some drawbacks, I had kickass time playing it, so I give it an:\n\n8.5/10"","March 10","true","39.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sandra_afrika/recommended/24240/","sandra_afrika","Lars Alexandersson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sandra_afrika/","244 products in account","So, this is a COOP game from 2011, but since half of these reviews are slow as ♥♥♥♥, I decided to come back and reveal yet another game from the dephts of the past years. I present to you, PAYDAY: The Heist.\n\nThis game is ♥♥♥♥ ass fun with friends, and not that good when playing solo. PAYDAY: The Heist's synopsis involves 4 professional guys robbing picked out heists. When I first started this game, I was given the benefit of the doubt in thinking that this will be some crappy indie game, even more doubt when I found out the company, Overkill Software, was formed from the directors of GRIN, whom is responsible for one of the worst, most generic games ever made, EVER. I was wrong.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nNow, the game doesn't have those top-notch graphics we see, it ponders more to the gameplay, but this section isn't left out. Everything, from the First World Bank, to the No Mercy hospital is enriched in detail, and complexity. Low-res textures are, as much as they can, removed and only when you are some detail-nut who likes to notice things. The game doesn't offer that much of a linear chance, but everything is complex and well-made. There are also some visual filter stuff in the menu I don't use. Bloom ♥♥♥♥, while appearing at some points of a heist, is not excessive and appears only for added realism. All-in all, graphics are pretty good.\n\nSOUND\n\nThe sounds, while not perfectly executed, give some needed environments the buff they need. Civilians screaming in terror are probably the most thought out, but the guns don't sound great. For example, the cops shooting their pistol sounds pretty ♥♥♥♥ing weak. And when huge firefights occur, the gun sounds just take a huge ♥♥♥♥ and leave, because everything is just said gun sounds, no bullets whizzings or anything. Doesn't give that much of a scenery if you ask me. The music makes up for it though. It's a mix of rock and electronic, and gives you that adrenaline pump when you need it. Bass rapes the songs at times, but it's still executed to pump you even more.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nNow here is the best part of the game. It really gives it it's substance. You and your buddies go on heists that are picked for you. Prediction is eliminated at this point, because every situation occurs RANDOMLY, and requires you and your team to pick out your loadouts carefully. At the start, you are bestowned with the option to scout out ahead and mark out the plan, which doesn't give the game that immediate action build like the mainstream concurence now-a-days. The only drawback I have on this heisting system is how unreal it is. Seriously, you get like 5000 SWAT officers shoved up your ♥♥♥. WHERE the ♥♥♥♥ do they find this kind of firepower? I am drilling the vault, and a great bunch of police officers appear at an Assault wave ready to buttrape you. Of course, this is all for an intended challenge, but really? You're gonna bring the whole America down on my ♥♥♥? Once you start the heist, you can use the F key to shout at stupid ♥♥♥ civilians who don't listen to you. They also managed to sucessfully find some use out of the keyboard key. You can use that to make officers cuff themselves, mark out special units, and do a ♥♥♥♥♥on of other things. It's amazing how much use one button can do here. Most of the gameplay involves drills and saws that are required, so it may get tedious for you, but the replayability and different scenarios excuse for it it, and gives it more interest the more you play. The A.I, unfortunatley, sucks balls when you play solo, but it can be perfectly understood because this is a CO-OP game and not designed only for you (if in that case you have no friends, ♥♥♥♥♥♥). The game also warrants defending your backs. If you go alone to find some object or ♥♥♥♥, you can guarantee you'll be in custody, unless you're pretty sure you can handle the cops. It's all about thinking and planning everything out as a team. You get a HUGE arsenal for things to prep yourself up too. Silenced UZIs, pistols, 2 shotguns, assault rifles and so much more. If you're a gun-nut, you'll love it. I had some added problems with the difficulties, because it's just police spam all around, and basically redefines the whole meaning of difficult. You need to SERIOUSLY prep up and have some firepower to finish a mission on the highest difficulty. This difficulty is somewhat lowered when the music from earlier kicks in during an Assault wave for adrenaline, and also the added cash, to remind your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ that you have a million bucks waiting for you to roll in.\n\nSTORY\n\nThere is no story for the game, but it has a synopsis. Basically, 4 guys (a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, a Sheffield guy, American and a Swedish) gather around and eventually meet some hacker/whatever called Bain. From then on, it's straight heisting. My favourite guy is Hoxton, the British ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThis game is what CO-OP should be. While it has some drawbacks, I had kickass time playing it, so I give it an:\n\n8.5/10"","March 10","true","39.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daniel_faraday/recommended/24240/","daniel_faraday","Daniel Potter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daniel_faraday/","845 products in account","Status: Approved (Get it, but on sale)\n\nWhat is Payday The Heist?\nWell, it's a 4 player coop game. To put it short it's probably a wave based FPS. Mostly, players will try to hold ground and hold off the police till the objective gets done to progress futher. Other then that some heist have multiple objectives to guard, thus leaving one behind to defend it. There are times when you need to get something fixed, so one player has to go and do that etc. Plus the game also has items that players can equip and share like medic bags, ammo. Well, it certainly does good at coop, that i can say.\n\nThe original game consists of 6 heists. Unlike Payday 2 or The Wolf's DLC, the original game's heists don't offer much variety, so you can't really go stealthy and all. One mission has stealth, but it's partial and too linear in my opinion. Overkill also added an extra free mission - No Mercy.\nps: No Mercy & The Wolf DLC are basically the foundation of Payday 2. They have dynamic events, so probably the next time you play them, them may have the safe in a different place, the items(like wooden logs) in random places etc. Though there is a slight difference with Payday 2's, they had those events, where some random event could happen, like you would go into a safe and it will be full of C4, it won't always happen unlike in Payday 2.\n\nThe game has 3 special enemies: Bulldozer, Tazer and Cloaker. It also have cops with shields and standard cops(their armor depends on the difficulty level). They will require different tactics to be used against them, making a more exciting gameplay. The game has armor and health: armor outlines your characters avatar in bottom right, and it can regenerate, health on the other hand can't. When you get 0 health you will be put into bleedout(last stand), either you will get put into custody or get saved by your teammates. Your teammates can also trade you for a hostage.\n\nThe game also has great unique atmosphere. Like come on, how many games let you rob banks, yet  can really give your that feeling. The game even has different masks to choose from. You can tie up hostages, and trade them. And of course you can interact with MONEY.\n\nI want to address one big issue though\nThe amount of content. The base game has only 7 heist, and a very small amounts of guns, other then that, it has 145 level, and damn, it's very tedious, yet offering a very small amount of rewards.\nBecause of that i suggest most people to purchase it on a sale. Though i suggest you to get the Wolf DLC , which gives you 2 heists and a new set of weapons.(it's really worth it)\n\nOne thing i want to breakdown to you, is the leveling up system.\nThere are 145 levels and 3 upgrade trees, each has 48 unlocks(48x3=144), and after you unlock them all you get the 49th unlock(#145)\nEach time you level up you get an unlock in the tree that you had chosen\nYou choose the upgrade tree during the mission, by holding down "Tab" and pressing [1], [2], or [3]\nThe DLC adds another upgrade tree, increasing the level cap from 145 to 193(48 unlocks). To upgrade it's tree you do the same as for the above.","November 17, 2013","true","31.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shudack/recommended/24240/","shudack","Shu[D]acK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shudack/","322 products in account","Imagine the perfect robbery: you know the blueprints inside out, when the guards go for their coffee breaks, and exactly how to get into the safe. Everything goes without a hitch, and by the time the safe is found, you're laughing. Not a shot fired. Payday: The Heist doesn't work like that.\n\nDespite the crime-caper presentation, tactical objectives and elaborate plans, Payday always comes down to shooting. Four players go into a situation - a bank with a vault full of juicy gold in the basement, an ambush to rescue a prisoner from a police convoy - and then get into a hell of a big fight with the police. It's a magpie co-op shooter, most obviously influenced by Left 4 Dead's dynamic approach to the team-based FPS and Modern Warfare's Spec Ops mode, and its developers are clearly students of the mass of 'horde' modes out there.\n\nPayday has faults, but is very good indeed, an FPS where common elements are carefully made to fit its rhythm rather than just taken for granted: this sounds like faint praise, but it has the best ammo balancing I've seen in a long time. Players start fully-stocked and a perk can give bigger starting clips, but from that point every bullet has to be maximised. Enemies drop small amounts of ammo, but only enough to keep your head above water.\n\nHealth is equally well-handled, a mixture of an overall bar that only recharges in segments and a 'shield' that recharges wholly. The more the overall bar goes down, the faster the player is knocked down, making it a treasure to be guarded: a backup that in clutch moments gives that extra second of life.\n\nYou're always on a knife-edge. A healthy team can feel invincible, but a team that's been banged up is too brittle to fight carelessly. One-time deployables can be taken into missions, and using them wisely is a whole other story.\n\nOn top of such considered engineering, Payday boasts a winning art style that mixes grotesque clown masks with sharp suits and a brutishly high-tech take on law enforcement. Even more impressive - stunning, even - is the dynamic audio design, which contributes to all of Payday's most exhilarating moments. One level will have a tight, looping drum beat that builds and builds into a pounding house tune just as all hell is breaking loose; another will begin with a cheesy piece of europop that turns into an industrial wail of sirens. It has an absolute gift for catching the right moment to push itself to the front and centre of the experience, and burrows its way into your mindset. When the sound's going crazy, so are you.\n\nThe cops are a motley bunch at the start of a mission, wearing their short-sleeved blue shirts and little caps and dying in droves. As things pick up, more capable classes start mixing into the waves: machine-gunners with light body armour, shotgunners in thick riot gear and special agents that sneak around before emptying a revolver into your back. Individually, they don't amount to much and neither does the AI, but you'll only ever see them in swarming groups that seem to come from nowhere, relentlessly battering a fixed position or skewering a moving group.\n\nPayday's mission structure is basically 'quiet time' and then 'assault', with much more of the latter. Each of its setups has mission objectives to be completed in the middle of the shooting, but every single one involves holding down a button at a certain point then waiting for a timer to tick down. Heat it ain't, but things are kept interesting by the objectives changing position and sequence on each playthrough - a structure that comes to fruition in Diamond Heist. (More on that later.)\n\nThere are always small groups of cops around, but every few minutes the game sends a heavily-telegraphed wave of enemies in, which puts the game in 'Assault' mode. These relentless firefights can last from a few minutes to what feels like an eternity, but is probably more like 15 minutes - and during it, hundreds and hundreds of cops will die. They pour out of corridors, scale balconies, drop from helicopters, bust down doors, explode out of lift shafts - and if they get position on your team, the crossfire is withering.\n\nThe final twist in every assault wave is the special cops. They're half Left 4 Dead's special infected, half Modern Warfare 2's riot shields and Juggernauts - but at least they're good copies. The taser cop immobilises players with unerring accuracy, making them spasm and empty their gun's clip wildly until a team-mate intervenes or they go down. The Bulldozer's a giant that can take sustained punishment and mete it out, a terrifying sight when you're in a corner, and shield-toting cops make a slower but no less inexorable advance on your position, begging you to waste bullets. Cloakers are the one original nasty: pinpoint spec-ops soldiers that specialise in sneaking up or rushing in for a deadly melee attack and then picking off your buddies when they wander in to save the day.\n\nThe police have a lot of options and there's no telling exactly what an assault wave will contain - some wars are won at a distance with calm precision and some with a shotgun in the face. Payday only offers six missions, and some of those aren't huge, but the ebb and flow of its assault waves means it just about gets away with it - even in the same environment, with the same starting positions, no two waves play out alike.\n\nPayday does have one recurring problem: its downtime is often too long. There will be times when, one minute after surviving a pitched battle, you're waiting on a roof for the next event to be triggered or the next police attack - and nothing happens. Payday's best moments are when it stitches its discrete chunks together seamlessly, moving from dynamic objectives into assault waves into brief respites. But every so often, it just leaves you hanging.\n\nThere are other flat notes. Civilians can be tied up to use as hostages - these can be traded between rounds for any team member who's gone down permanently, and cause the police to start sending in rescue squads. The mechanic fills a role capably enough but feels a little under-developed: being able to use hostages as bargaining chips or human shields during assaults, for example, would seem obvious.\n\nPayday doesn't even go that deep, and to be fair it shows little desire to. But there are infuriating inconsistencies within its world. You must avoid killing civilians, for example, in the midst of these slaughterfests - but these civilians are so nakedly designed to keep on running into crossfire that hitting one feels like the game's pulled a trick on you.\n\nThere are plenty more moments of silliness, but Payday gets it right, too: sawing through bars and burning through vault roofs with thermite are the stuff blueprints are made of. And then there's the Diamond Heist.\n\nIn terms of robber fantasies, there are few better setups than a high-security vault filled with diamonds on the top floor of a skyscraper, slap bang in the middle of a party. Only available on Hard difficulty, Diamond Heist is easily Payday's most dynamic and varied mission, with major branches opening up differently on each play-through, and it's set in a quite brilliant environment.\n\nThe vault's in the middle, and several balcony floors rise around it full of offices and cubbyholes. Staircases lead to a huge roof with a helipad and glass skylights. The mission can be completed entirely through stealth, the four players moving silently from floor to floor disabling alarms and avoiding security patrols, before a clean getaway without a shot fired. This didn't happen a single time that I was involved.\n\nRating: 10/10","January 22, 2014","true","66.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's not a game for 'John Rambo' players.\n\nIt's very hard to obtain all achiviements, because the game is a lot hard, even on normal difficulty, especially without a good teamwork.\n\nThe game has inspirations on Left 4 Dead. The crew of Overkill admitted that, and put a lot of easter eggs of Left 4 Dead on game. Also, you can find easter eggs from the movie Heat (1995) that has a history of a bank robbery.\n\nExplore the game while trying to survive...\n\nTeam up and got fun!\n\nMy Personal Score                Fun:        8/10                Gameplay:        8/10                Ambientation:        7/10                History:        3/10                Replayability:        8/10                Multiplayer:        9/10\n--\n\nPayday The Heist - Análise: Se divirta com os caras maus\n\nEste é um jogo excitante, onde você não apenas pode trabalhar em equipe, mas realmente precisa fazê-lo.\nÉ um jogo para jogar com amigos, como um time. Não é um jogo para jogadores do tipo 'John Rambo'.\n\nÉ muito dificil obter todas as conquistas, porque o jogo é muito dificil, mesmo na dificuldade normal, especialmente sem um bom trabalho em equipe.\n\nO jogo possui inspirações em Left 4 Dead. A equipe da Overkill admitiu isso e colocou vários easter eggs do jogo. Você também vai encontrar easter eggs do filme Heat (Fogo contra Fogo - 1995), que conta a história de um assalto a banco.\n\nExplore o jogo enquanto tenta sobreviver...\n\nJunte seu time e se divirta!\n\nMinhas Notas Pessoais                Diversão:        8/10                Gameplay:        8/10                Ambientação:        7/10                História:        3/10                Rejogabilidade:        8/10                Multiplayer:        9/10","December 21, 2013","true","105.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I like how simple, independent games like these always manage to get me to sink many more hours into it than any of the higher budget titles that are out. Unlike most shooters out, Payday forces you to play realistically. Your goal is not to rack up a body count, but to perform a heist. Rough around the edges, short in length, and aiming takes some time to get use to. However, in it's own way, it is very innovative. Each stage (lasting roughly 25-35 minutes) boasts with new surprises and situations depending on how you play and who you play with. No run through of any stage is ever the same. The stylish gameplay, cool concepts, and massive amounts of variety within it's few stages will keep players coming back for a very long time.","December 31, 2013","true","43.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I was surprised to find out they are like 2 completely different games!\n\nABOUT THE GAME:Take on the role of a hardened career criminal executing intense, dynamic heists in constant pursuit of the next “big score”\n\nPROS: + Fantastic level design (completely different missions unlike PD2)\n+ Vast variety of enemy types (cloakers, tasers, shields, dozers, its amazing)\n+ Can be very challenging and engaging (requires teamwork)\n+ Unique gameplay mechanics (taking hostages, restarting drills etc)\n+ Skills and equipment are cool (a little bit lacking of content)\n\nCONS: - You can't skip the opening cutscenes (makes repeating missions tedious)\n- Only a few missions (can make the game feel repetitive)\n- Interaction times are off (even with skills, restarting drill takes FOREVER)\n- Stealth mechanics suck (not really much to work with)\n- Connection problems (they happen often)\n\nSUMMARY: The game is a lot more simple than its predecessor PAYDAY 2, but it is still just as fun in it's on way. It is much more loud oriented and doesn't have much stealth in it, but makes working with your teammates to complete tough missions more satisfying.\n\nFinal Grade:7 / 10 jammed drills","July 24, 2015","true","56.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

I got the most sense of satisfaciton from the teamplay in this game, and even if when i'm playing solo, the challenge is there, and it's even more fun to just go try them out and test yourself.\n\nA classic that you shouldn't miss.\n","February 7","true","143.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/viciousmann/recommended/24240/","viciousmann","Cl0wnFace","http://steamcommunity.com/id/viciousmann/","159 products in account","PAYDAY: The Heist is not an ordinary FPS shooter. This game is the reason for my avatar on Steam, even. PAYDAY: The Heist is a beautiful combination of variety, interesting replayability, and tons of fun! It is on par with other shooters, yet it retains it's ability to keep you engulfed in becoming from a small-time offender to a hardened career criminal who knows his way around an Overkill 145+ heist.\n\nYou start off with a simple pistol and assault rifle, your later best friends and life-savers. But as you continue to play more, you'll get more eager to see the heist stand out it's varied script events and interesting turn-outs that will manage to keep you playing for hours with friends, until you probably reach Level 15. From there on, you're on you're on your way to Level 145 (or, for the DLC owners, 193).\n\nThe gameplay is certainly well done. Repeating myself, it is on par with other popular and mainstream shooters like Call of Duty, but it does not show it at all.  While it can be blamed for being a little too much Left 4 Dead, it is still great. You play as the bad guys this time, and the good guys try to stop you. So, in common sense, what do the bad guys do? Kill them, of course! You can choose to be silent and get out with tons of cash without anyone noticing, or go the idiot's way and blast your way in, guns-blazing. This encourages further teamwork and demands faster reflex so you can make it out alive with the loot you've gotten. The guns are big enough to be embedded in the gameplay. It is of absolute necessity to choose your guns wisely, as a gun in it's wrong scenario can cause a lot of troubles for you and your team. As you continue dominating the map, the police switch tactics, and you must watch your backs from then on, because the police in this game are not dumb. The police will always try to outrun you in terms of tactics, sometimes even try to fool you, as they work in formations and form deadly teams. The Bulldozer is definently something you must avoid. Cloakers play hide-and-seek at times. Tazers are your death sentence if you go alone, and the Shield is a fool that must be fooled most of the time, as they run out trying to kill you instead of watching their backs. The maps are linear and have a touch of exploration. There is NEVER a big part of the map you will not be forced to go to, and it is absolutley not straight. Every map is divided in areas and is large enough for the heist to make you explore the area as you do objectives. Explorating is also encouraged as there are money bundles hidden anywhere. Heat Street is definently rectified, but that is only one heist to challenge you, and it is completely optional!\n\nThe gunplay is amazing. It has weight to it, unlike other games (cough CoD cough). When you kill a special unit, you'll feel good, because you've just brought down one of the police's top-notch units. And that is not all. Literally, the recoil, the sounds of the guns will keep you livid to kill more cops, as well as confident enough to go in deeper during an Assault wave and slaughter an entire police team. It's also very well-paced.\n\nThe graphics may not be super high-tech like many other companies aim to do now again, but the environments on some maps are gorgeous and well-executed enough to immerse you. It manages to suceed, even if the game is more enticed on it's gameplay rather than graphics.\n\nThe audio is superb! The voice acting for Bain and other characters is so good, the yells are powerful, and even the police is listenable and has some interesting quotes. The sound effects for the environments, explosions, and firefights is intense. The explosions sometimes feel weak and feeble, but everything else makes up for it.\n\nThe leveling is something I have a problem with ONLY. You start off with nothing except a pistol, a perk, and an assault rifle. This makes heisting very hard, as you're practically standing naked. I know this was designed so you can play with higher-leveled friends, but for people who need a boost so they can at least play better and support their team in multiplayer later on, this can be a tad frustrating or tedious, because even Easy can be hard for some players. But in every other aspect, I want nothing changed in this game.\n\nPAYDAY: The Heist executes all the moves from games of today, and fits it in one tight, playable package that is sure to keep you enthralled for more. Even if it's sequel, Payday 2, is now a grind-fest, ahem, and inferior game gameplay-wise to this one, I would recommend PAYDAY: The Heist for players looking for something new, fresh and with action.\n\n9.5/10","December 2, 2013","true","112.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And as level up you gain experience to unlock new weapons, new abilities and new perks to help yourself and your teammates.\nBe quick, be sharp, be smart, and always remember to stand together.\n\nYou will find yourself having to rely on your crew to get you out of trouble, so be prepared to learn and do the same as well.\n\nAlas, I highly recommend giving this game a try. Its entertainment value, affordable price tag and its interesting co-operative gameplay shouldn't disappoint.","June 19, 2013","true","172.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It lacks some features such as more advanced stealth and skill trees from Payday 2 but the gameplay is much better. There are no micro-payments, no skins. Just you, your buddies and your gun. Also, the difficulty is much higher, you actually have to be good at the game to play on Overkill difficulty! And no OP DLC will help you overcome that problem. Speaking of DLC. there is only one availible, and it adds much more than so called "DLC's" or money grabs in PD2. It adds 2 new heists, new unlocks, new weapons and the best part is that if your friends don't have the DLC maps they can still play with you if one player has the DLC! The levels are challenging and fun, the gameplay feels more tactical and Co-Op focused.

And this review will be a little different kind of review because I am answering your question right there.\n\nPAYDAY: The Heist is a clunky mess. But there's just something in the game that you can't just shout "I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE IT". PAYDAY had more character, more badassness, more additude than the second one and that's why I will always remember the day I finally got to play this game. It was on PS3 and my mind was blown with how awesome it was to play the game. It felt so right to do wrong; killing cops and stealing ♥♥♥♥ felt amazing! The game had something so unique compared to most of the FPS games at the time. And the gameplay still holds up even today.\n\nAnyways, that's that for the nostalgia. Now the the real part of the review. What makes PAYDAY better than PAYDAY 2? The heists. The content. The difficulty. PAYDAY: The Heist heavily relys on the team play rather than making the enemies insanely overpowered (like in PAYDAY 2) and makes you think what kind of stuff you are going to bring with you. This is something PAYDAY 2 doesn't have. Variety! PAYDAY: The Heist has variety in the Heists so you really need to think about what you're bringing with you. PAYDAY 2 has a bit more... straightforward heists.\n\nSo which one should you buy? I fyou are a big fan of the game: both. If you want to play with your friends: PAYDAY: The Heist. If you are a newcomer to the whole PAYDAY thing: I would suggest for you to get PAYDAY 2 GoTY.","December 14, 2015","true","19.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And this review will be a little different kind of review because I am answering your question right there.\n\nPAYDAY: The Heist is a clunky mess. But there's just something in the game that you can't just shout "I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE IT". PAYDAY had more character, more badassness, more additude than the second one and that's why I will always remember the day I finally got to play this game. It was on PS3 and my mind was blown with how awesome it was to play the game. It felt so right to do wrong; killing cops and stealing ♥♥♥♥ felt amazing! The game had something so unique compared to most of the FPS games at the time. And the gameplay still holds up even today.\n\nAnyways, that's that for the nostalgia. Now the the real part of the review. What makes PAYDAY better than PAYDAY 2? The heists. The content. The difficulty. PAYDAY: The Heist heavily relys on the team play rather than making the enemies insanely overpowered (like in PAYDAY 2) and makes you think what kind of stuff you are going to bring with you. This is something PAYDAY 2 doesn't have. Variety! PAYDAY: The Heist has variety in the Heists so you really need to think about what you're bringing with you. PAYDAY 2 has a bit more... straightforward heists.\n\nSo which one should you buy? I fyou are a big fan of the game: both. If you want to play with your friends: PAYDAY: The Heist. If you are a newcomer to the whole PAYDAY thing: I would suggest for you to get PAYDAY 2 GoTY.","December 14, 2015","true","19.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If anyone is thinking about buying this then get it! It is one of those few games that make you feel rewarding and make you want to do more things. Payday The Heist is about four guys, Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains. You get to choose who you want to paly as and what heist you want to do. As you play and beat heists you will get money which is what you use to level up your class. There are 3 (4 if you get the DLC) classes that you get to level up. Each class has different weapons, crew bonuses and bags. The difficulty of the heists depend if you want to just have a normal experience. Overkill if you want to go hard. And easy which is only for the two heists for people who just started playing the game. Over all, this game is a fantastic FPS.

Whereas Payday 2 has more options and an RPG style progression, Payday: The Heist is much more linear in how the game unfolds.  You can unlock all of the skills in the game, there are a small selection of weapons, and at most the "skills" are designed to work around a party of 4.\n\nWhat this game lacks in choice, it makes up for one of the best heist/action movie simulators you're going to play in a long damn time.  Straight up recreations of scenes from movies, or entire movies themselves.  Rather than throw 20+ different options to complete at a heist at you, you often have one objective to complete at a time, often with dozens of cops throwing themselves at you.\n\nHoled up on a rooftop with SWAT climbing up the sides and jumping from adjacent buildings at you? Check.  Fighting your way down a crowd downtown street, chasing a traitor who stole your cash ala HEAT? Check.  Sneaking into a highrise building to steal a buttload of diamonds while holding various corporate members hostage for negotiation?  Check and check.\n\nThe graphics have aged a bit, being a 5 year old game, but they get the job done and it's well optimized.  The music is absolutely amazing, and in many aspects I would count it as better than Payday 2's soundtrack.  Rather than dubstep/DnB tracks, P:TH opts for breakbeat loops with emphasis on bass, giving it a lower key but higher overall intensity feeling to the shootouts.  Rather than spending the entire match in a constant shootout with cops regardless if there's an assault in progress or not, the game gives you downtime inbetween assaults, letting the tension build before dropping you into a balls out assault wave from every direction.  It gets you in the mood and honestly keeps me coming back to the game again and again.  I particularly enjoy the Panic Room Theme, which slowly builds up as you fight your way up the derelict apartment building to the saferoom filled with cash.\n\nAt $15 this game is a steal, the WolfPack DLC is unnecessary but does come with some nice skills and weapons, it's your call though since it's 66% the price of the actual vanilla game.","May 16","true","45.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

They start all of their heists with some dude who has a kickass plan to do everything without a hitch and get away clean, but naturally our downsy antiheroes screw it up by walking in without masks shouting and then shoot police instantly. The heists usually go downhill from there until somebody smacks a drill on something, but being special-ed superstars they cant even get that right, having to go back and hit it several times until they get the drill right. Eventually they go into a vault/safe/moms basement and fill bags with money, leave them on the ground, then run away giddy with the 'millions they totally just made and will never have to work again' which equates to their share of rent at the group home and a few trips to mcdonalds. In summary a more realistic and addictive game than cowadooty. 7/10 would DURR again.","August 11, 2012","true","63.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Even L4D has "infected vs survivors" mode. My first impression of Payday was "juggalo FPS"; that alone made me NOT want to play it. Indeed, I always pick the raptor mask. If you hit Level 145 (ha!), you get the President masks from Point Break!\n\nSee, this is a grand homage to robbery heists in contemporary crime drama cinema. The levels consist of a multitude of objectives, with a bit of randomness at points. Co-op here means more than Team DM. You NEED the voice chat, preferably with friends, and you need 4 people. Even then this game WILL kick your ♥♥♥. If you don't coordinate with everyone AND plan things right, you WILL lose. Sure, you keep your XP (gain levels, get perks/guns/etc), but the devs keep adding content for the higher difficulties! I wish they'd make a tutorial.

I can understand this, because the graphics are amazing, the animations are realistic, and the amount of effort put into this game is overwhelmingly great.

Because each megabyte of Payday: The Heist full of references to these movies... and  to many others.\n\nPros:+ A unique concept of cooperative game.\n+ Beautiful and minimalist design.\n+ Excellent balance.\n+ Hardcore.\n+ Additional capabilities (variability, in-game experience, challenges, customization)\n+ Crossover with the Left 4 Dead Universe (easter eggs, additional heist NO MERCY)\n+ Fair price (the game was distributed for free of charge during Crimefest)\n+ There is only 1 paid DLC (except OST) and no microtransactions (as in PayDay 2)\n\nFeatures:• Strong, but a modest content (like in Left 4 Dead)\n• Unideal AI (but much more smartest than in Killing Floor)\n• The game has no support by developers anymore (but it works perfect)\n• As a result - there is no anti-cheat (recommended to play with friends)\n\nCons:- Some things should be realized much better (optimization, stealth mode, perks menu)\n- No support for custom modifications.\n\n8/10\nOutcome:ᅠPayDay: The Heist - a revolution in a particular genre of games. Cooperative robbery, wow!\nNo more zombies, infected or mutants. Just cops and robbers. But there is a special squad, which is ready to kick your аss. And believe me, you have to make an effort that did not happen.\nᅠCharacters, dialogues, sets and music - everything points to a lot of cult thrillers and action movies. This game literally consists of explicit and implicit references to ones. You will visit the deja vu on UNDERCOVER heist, in all senses.\nᅠUndoubtedly, the product has some flaws. But it is necessary to take into account, that Payday: The Heist - debut(!) of Overkill Software (an independent studio at the time). It's made with lots of love, and isn't overly commercialized like PayDay 2.\nᅠPayday: The Heist is able to gift you and your friends a lot of pleasant evenings and it is can be buyed during steam sale for a song. With this game you can to be in robber's shoes, not robbed. And, in case you are a big cinephile (like me), you will find yourself in paradise.","March 28","true","147.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You start with M4 and M9 pistol like level 0 (there is reputation, not level) and you will stealing jewelery, gold or money in 8 maps (with DLC). Yeah, the true is that if you played PAYDAY 2 I think you won´t like it, cause here´s only a few weapons and upgrades, bonuses, and not a RPG part like in payday 2. But If you won´t play PAYDAY 2 or If you was big fan of Payday 2 and you wanna take a look How our group looks before Hoxton gets to Prison you should buy it.\n\nAll in all: 92%","November 28, 2014","true","357.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The best way I can describe this game would have to be, just totally amazing. Thats it, just totally amazing.\n\nThe only bad thing(s) about this game are, you must buy the DLC pack, "Payday: The Heist Wolfpack DLC" if you want to play the best maps and have the best guns, which is only $8,49 to buy. The other bad thing is, so many noobs! This isn't bad but, if you don't want people always getting down, don't play with noobs.\n\nOther than that, good game!

It isn't necessarily the best game around, but it definitely is fun to play. There is a lot of farming involved with leveling up, but as you farm, your character gets better and you get more improved weapons. There is never a dull moment. Due to the randomization of the enemy spawn locations, no two levels are exactly the same. A guard could burst through a door in a level where that never happened before. The game keeps you on the edge of your seat, and it has the classic effect of making you want the rage quit once you die.\n\nHowever, the main setback of this game is that the AI (or your teammates) are absolutely terrible. They run about as fast as a rabbit with two broken legs, and you have to stop sprinting in order for them to keep up with you. Also, when you are down and are bleeding out, you usually have to shout out to them in order for them to actually come to your aid. But, setting this drawback aside, if you have friends to play with, the game will still be a fantastic co-op experience.\n\nMy overall rating for this game will have to be an 8/10. It's not the best game in the world, but it is FAR from being the worst.","August 15, 2014","true","40.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's reasonably easy to learn, and yet takes quite a bit of practice to master the top difficulty!\n\nThe two main goals of the game is to complete heists, and by doing so, earn "reputation" (XP) to unlock new weapons and gear, and upgrades for those weapons and gear. There's also plenty of challenges to keep you busy long after you hit max level! The Wolfpack DLC adds a new set of stuff, and also two new heists, so is well worth it. (Note: you can still join a game that's hosting a DLC map if you don't own the DLC, but you need to own the DLC to host those maps yourself)\n\nSo buy this game, steal money, level up, and maybe, just maybe, you can get golden masks, if you're good enough. ;)","December 23, 2012","true","225.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Dont forget to buy Wolfpack DLC whic adds quitre cool stuff in the game.Hope this helps someone ;-)","June 23, 2014","true","34.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It seems like after PayDay everybody is trying to implement the same kind of experience. What makes PayDay so successfull is the element of authenticity.

Sure it's part of the game but it get's to the point where you can't get decent drills.\n\nLet's talk about the game and it's good parts. It's a fun game with friends esspecially the Diamond Heist Mission as you can do it all stealth mode and it's fast and easy and get's you a ton of cash. It maybe hard playing with other players online as there's a lack of communication but when you're playing with mates it's fun, suspenseful and rage inducing at times.\n\nOverall, Payday: The Heist is a classic Cops Vs Robbers game where it's fast paced when you have to escape, suspenseful when you're going stealthy and the tension builds up as a ton of SWAT swarms around you when you're waiting for the drill to finish. 5 Star game with a few  downsides but none the less it's an amazing game with friends to play. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for an action packed game with mates.\n\n-ŁogiX™","July 6, 2014","true","69.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Being an indie company and the game insipred from Batman the Dark night opening scene where the joker robs the bank (you can now do in pd2) this game is really fun.

Clearly a lot of thought process was put by the developers when designing the game (They were inspired from the movie "the heat") Every heist that you attempted have failed in one point or another and "clearing" every single heist is actually an accomplishment.  Yes, every single one of them is hard. unlike payday 2, where you complete the heist and goes "meh".\n\nIn Payday the Heist, normal mode is actually Overkill mode in Payday 2. Yes, I am serious, it's that hard. So you shall give yourselves a medal if you ever complete every single one of them. Gameplay wise and other stuffs overall was perfect.\n\nStill, Kudos to Almir and Overkill studios for this awesome game.\n\n10/10","December 1, 2014","true","47.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have heard that Payday 2 got some bad reviews after the "microtransactions" thing, but this game is better. First, we have the rank up system. It takes forever to rank up and get cool stuff; my friend bought me the DLC "wolf Pack" and I immediately thought I was going to already have the new weapons and equipment unlocked. that was not the case. Second, I would like to point out that the starting weapons are Peashooters and you can't get a kill with any of them (you get a crappy assault rifle and supressed pistol). Third, even on the lowest difficulty, you get killed too easily and that makes the game repetitive because you have to rely on other people (and AI) to help you up and you don't get your health back or anything else. Fourth, threre are a lot of glitches. On multiple occassions, I have seen enemies flying around like the have "noclip" on and enemies running through walls and barriers, which can be either frustrating or funny. Lastly, the game could do with a few more "heists" because the ones that are there now get repetitive because there is only about 7 of them and they consist of you: shooting cops and SWAT team members, dying, grabbing money (gold, Diamonds, etc.), tying up hostages, accidentally shooting Civilians because you thought they were cops, and objectives the require you to repetitively run back and fourth. I know this review sound negative, but I think this game is fun. I would like to see more work done with this game, even though Overkill probably won't add to or fix an old game, but it could have more "heists", more types of enemies, more weapons, a new (and better) rank up system, and possibly better (or different) starting weapons. Overall, I think it's fun to play with my Friends.","October 17, 2015","true","120.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/24240/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nPAYDAY: The Heist is a first person shooter developed by OVERKILL Software and released in 2011. The game can be played solo, or as 4-player co-op, you get to Heist 6 zones/areas and depending on events that occur within the game your play experience will change.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  There isn't much to say about the story behind PAYDAY: the Heist, it's basically four robbers (Wolf, Dallas, Hoxton, and Chains) who teamed up to Rob the "First World Bank".\n\nGame Play: As has already been said, the game plays as a FPS but instead of just mindlessly gunning down civilians and cops, you need to be careful about who you shoot (You are penalized for killing civilians), and the game is objective oriented. In other words, "You could just kill cops for days, and your game would never end, or you can kill as little as possible and get experience faster."\nThere is a level system within the game, you gain experience from picking up money/gems/currency, as you level up you unlock new weapons, tools, and armor.\n\nAchievements: The achievements on PAYDAY: the Heist are TOUGH, most of these require a solid team to play with, or a lot of determination/practice/luck. I haven't taken the time to start working on these achievements yet, I'm only sitting at 7 out of 56 achievements (05/18/15). I intend to try for more achievements, but most of them require specific conditions to be met, and "must be there at the start of the heist".\n\nPrice: PAYDAY: The Heist is priced at $14.99, I personally picked up my copy on the 24 hour give away October 16, 2014. I recommend waiting for a sale to purchase this game. However if you're really into 4-player FPS's this is your game, and you can easily pump 20+ hours into this game, thereby justifying the purchase at full price.\n\nConclusion: I've always felt that I'm not the best critic of these types of games since I spend most of my time playing by myself, or with one other friend. I enjoyed playing PAYDAY: The Heist, however I only played single player or with one friend.\nI would recommend this to people who already have friends they play 4 player games with, I could see Left 4 Dead fans easily getting attached to this game - if looking for a different flavor of 4-player-FPS.","May 18, 2015","true","7.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(Payday 2, so more gaming is available).\n\nCon's\n- When someone is joining your game. (Already started) You'll have to wait a few. (Depending on their internet connection.) But you can disable that.\n- Payday The Heist isn't getting updated due to the recent game that OVERKILL released (Payday 2).\n\nIn general, this game is awesome, and very fun to play with others.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/7grain/recommended/24240/","7grain","7grain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/7grain/","291 products in account","Payday is a fun co-op game, but it lacks polish.\n\nThe maps are of uneven quality and difficulty. There is frequently a feeling of "what do I do next?” with inadequate guidance from the game. It helps to play with experienced players, but when you do, you're dragging your team down because you don't have all the levelling perks that they do.\n\nThere also seem to be many ways to game each level. Beating levels seems to be less about adapting on the fly, and more about knowing exactly where to hide out while you're waiting for events to happen. And you do spend a lot of time in this game waiting for stuff to happen.\n\nBut past the flaws, Payday is a game with a cheap $20 price tag. There is a certain breeziness to the gameplay that's just a rollicking good time.  The harder difficulty levels require teamwork and planning, which I appreciate. Payday delivers a satisfying co-op experience, of which there are too few today. Really – if judged solely for its “co-op-iness”, this game is top-flight… playing on a well-coordinated team is a great experience.\n\nI want to mention that you kill a lot of cops in Payday. A lot.  There's no stealth element here. Through the years, shooters have given us a variety of enemies to gun down of increasingly human-like appearance:  Aliens, robots, zombies, soldiers. Criminals occasionally appeared, especially mobsters. But cops? These aren't even "corrupt cops.” Call me squeamish, but I find this ... distasteful.\n\nAll in all, Payday is a good game, even if it’s a bit rough around the edges. The soon-to-be-released sequel appears to be a much more ambitious effort. I hope the developers will be able to apply what they’ve learned from this game to the new one.\n","May 25, 2013","true","7.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

(Payday 2, so more gaming is available).\n\nCon's\n- When someone is joining your game. (Already started) You'll have to wait a few. (Depending on their internet connection.) But you can disable that.\n- Payday The Heist isn't getting updated due to the recent game that OVERKILL released (Payday 2).\n\nIn general, this game is awesome, and very fun to play with others. If you liked Payday The Heist, check out Payday 2!","July 30, 2014","true","89.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Much more fun than Payday 2, but crippled by a dying community, a lack of heists and poor stealth.  Much less bugs than Payday 2, so if you're sick of cloakers kicking you through walls, cameras seeing you through walls, audio glitches and random crashes, try playing this. Significantly harder than Payday 2, so if you enjoy playing loud missions, definitely pick this up. Also, the DLC is pretty fun.","November 22, 2014","true","64.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

The sequel giveth and it taketh away, but you're here to know why PAYDAY: The Heist is good. I'll cover the sequel in another review.\n\nPAYDAY is what you get when you take Left 4 Dead and turn it into Cops vs. Robbers, and you're the robbers. You rob a big bank blind, steal cash from drug dealers in a spectacular way, loot gold from an intercepted armored transport, and more. You can level up three (four with DLC) skill trees to get different perks and guns, and as far as the guns go, there's something for everyone. Whether you like precision, crowd control, or the best of all worlds, there's a gun for you. There's not as many as there are in 2, but none of them are particularly useless (sans the starting pistol and Locomotive secondary shotgun, arguably, but that's beside the point).\n\nThis is by no means an easy game, so if you want a challenge, you won't be disappointed. You'll quickly discover that cover is your best friend, and teamwork and coordination are essential. The heists are massive in scale and are loads of fun to play, with the difficulty varying per heist. Fair warning: just because Heat Street is the second heist in the list doesn't mean it's only a small step up from First World Bank. It's actually one of the hardest heists in the game. You can level up to 145 without DLC, 193 with DLC. Not to mention, you can max out all available skill trees!\n\nThe majority of the player base has migrated to the sequel, but you can still find some servers, or set up your own. Grab some friends and give it a go; it's one of the good ones.\n\nAlso, just a tip for newcomers: if you join a First World Bank server and the host says something about "overdrill," just leave.","November 19, 2014","true","226.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"
