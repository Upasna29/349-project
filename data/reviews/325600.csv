So if you re looking for an in depth review on how well this translates in a D&D context I am sorry, I don't have much for ya. Now to begin!\n\nThis game is actually a very good game, it is simply mauled by some bad choices that will probably annoy you over time such as\n\n- Non skippable cutscenes and dialogue.\n- Having to listen to that non skippable dialogue over and over if you lose to a boss.\n- Not all skill trees are available from the beginning.\n- One or two side quests in the game can glitch and become uncompleteable.\n- Your games are open to public by default and if you don't notice that a player can jump in while you are getting an xp reward and block your character from getting it.\n- Leveling takes a very long time so If you don't use a character for a while there is a good chance they aren't catching back up for the rest of the game.\n- Companion ai will sometimes neglect some of their skills and this can be exceptionally frustrating when its the healer.\n- All abilities in the game have fairly long cooldowns, normally a minute or higher\n\nHowever, despite these flaws, I really found this to be a gem of a game (just save often). In my opinion this plays like a much more refined and less clunky dragon age origins. It does a lot of great things other similar games just don't do as well, such as\n\n- Giving you a ton of abilities and skills that are all unique and interesting.\n- Giving you several options on how to use your classes ( I have a dual wielding tank that works!)\n- Avoiding boring fetch quests!\n- Making each quest feel meaningful.\n- Giving you options for how to complete quests (ponying up some coin to save time in some cases)\n- Making most characters in the game world feel unique and alive.\n- Making all encounters challenging enough to possibly kill you if you mess up, but not so hard they are enfuriating.\n- Making gold a resource that is valuable instead of something that is in endless supply.\n\nThis truly is a great game that does a ton of stuff well and is just an all around great party based rpg. However I can certainly see how some of the negatives can have people pulling their hair out. If you have any sort of patience then I highly recommend it. You can't beat it, especially for $20.\n\n90% of the negative reviews are people complaining this isn't D&D, so if you are looking for the most hardcore D&D experience then maybe skip this one (and play it on a board, no offense guys, but c'mon).\n\nAnother 5% are people complaining this isn't a $40 game and this hasn't been $40 bucks for a while so another moot point.\n\nIf you are just looking for a solid game, weigh my points above, and if the negatives don't sound like they will drive you insane, pick this up.","May 7","true","43.9"," 267 of 297 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","267","297","7","13"

It is a pretty standard isometric dungeon crawler. You can make a character, level them up and make them stronger with skill points you place in skill trees. You find better and better loot to make your character stronger to take on harder dungeons.\nThe DM mode is sort of an interesting mechanic as it allows you to play with and sort of "against" the people playing. There is sort of a balancing act to be done as you play, and the video demonstrations N-Space has provided of the DM mode is pretty accurate. The game also offers some very basic tools to create a campaign for players, but it really comes down to make one of 3 kinds of quests, and send them to a dungeon where the gameplay happens. There's very very little you can do as a DM in terms of acual scripting.\n\nAll in all, it's a relaitvely standard isometric dungeon crawler with a new mechanic of 4 + 1 players.\n\n\nThe second viewpoint of this game is that from the aspect of the pen and paper D&D player, and that is where the game earns its harshest critcism. This game bares very little in common in terms of gameplay to it's pen and paper cousin (or maybe estranged 5th cousin).\nThis game is fast paced with point and click with cooldowns. The characters have skill trees like most rpg characters do in video games. There's lots of magic loot to be found and tons of enemies to kill. If you've been playing the pnp version of D&D like I have, you'll notice right away that this sounds very little like the game you know and play, and you'd be right. A popular example is how Wizards work. They are your standard caster in basically any rpg, with skill trees of magic, totally lacking the ability to change out spells, and on the topic of spells, they do not work as they do in 5th edition either. Like most games, you get a spell like fireball. You put a skill point into it and you learn it. Next level,  you get another skill point and unlock fireball 2. There is no up casting in this game, which is how 5th edition works. You simply learn more powerful versions of the same spell. There are no spell uses per day, and there is no resting. As stated before, it's all cooldown based.\n\nI've seen numerous responses from the developers about how they worked with Wizards of the Coast and don't doubt that for a second. I'm sure they did, and while WotC may approve, most of the players, including myself, do not. For whatever reason, most of us were lead to believe this was going to be more or less a video game version of the pen and paper Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition. I've also read numerous times that "it's core is based on dnd 5e" and to that I would say this game is based on D&D 5e about as much as the movie "Patch Adams" was based on the life of the actual Hunter "Patch" Adams.\n\nSword Coast Legends is a pretty standard dungeon crawler wearing a D&D skin. From strictly a video game standpoint, it can be a fun game at times and could get a recommendation, but from my experience with the game, what I was lead to believe about it, and with my experience in playing tabletop D&D, I can not reccomend it. It is not what I wanted, and not what I expected. What really ruined this game for me was seeing the action based (not turn based) combat, cooldown system, and skill trees.\n\nEDIT:\n\nAt the time of writing this edit, community packs 1 and 2 have been released. I am glad to see the changes they have implemented. I feel as a DM (my main focus at this point) my control over the creation of the campaign getting better, and I hope it doesn't stop here. I still would like to see more additions in terms of scripting (I like to prepare as much as I can before hand) and perhaps even the addition of dialogue trees to NPCs, which I believe is coming in the next update.\n\nA new playable race is a welcome addition (I'm not the kind to complain about content given out for free), and I look forward to seeing what other races and perhaps classes will turn up in the future (and hopefully not too DLC crazy). If the trend continues, I definitely think this game will get its recommendations from a lot of people including myself, and it will be a hard earned one.","November 22, 2015","false","6.8"," 969 of 1,218 people (80%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","80","969","1","40","41"

I really tried, but in the end, it was a disappointment.  If you want a D&D-style game, buy Pillars of Eternity -- it's superior to Sword Coast Legend in every way.\n\nFirst, SCL is not really D&D, the mechanics are all wrong.  First, all abilities are cooldown-based.  Additionally, the cool downs are so long, that only in the very longest of battles (of which I have had less than 5), you can use your abilities only once.  This means that a wizard will launch all of his most powerful spells at the beginning of the battle, and then has to sit out the rest of fight, throwing cantrips from long range.  There is no strategy, and no skill in preparing particular spells.\n\nWorse yet, your enemies don't follow the D&D mechanics like your characters do.  While your characters deal damage and have HP in accordance (roughly) with D&D rules, your enemies have MASSIVE hitpoints, and do little damage.  This means that after your wizard launches all his spells at the beginning of combat, your enemies are hardly damaged at all.  Every battle, therefore, becomes a war of attrition.  Your melee fighters line up and slowly, ever so slowly, beat down the enemies' massive hitpoints.  Every battle is a sure victory provided you have enough potions or healing spells to keep your people on their feet.  No strategy, no tactics, no risk, and no interest.\n\nThird, there is so much magical loot none of it feels special.  Kill a goblin?  Magical loot.  Find a treasure chest sitting randomly in the middle of the forest?  Magical loot.  Break open a barrel on the side of the road in the Luskan slums? Magical loot.  It's too much.\n\nFourth, your party members are useful in combat only.  In Pillars of Eternity, one of the best things about the game were the text-based cutaways where you solved problems using your entire party's skills or attributes.  Here, only your main character's attributes matter for solving problems.  Here's one mind-numblingly aggravating example:  I needed to open a vine-covered trap door.  My character, a wizard, has low strength and failed to pull the vines off.  My party member, a fighter with massive strength, could not be used to pull the vines.  Additionally, despite knowing spells like fireball and disintigration, my wizard was not given the option to use those skills to remove the vines.\n\nFifth, you have very few abilities.  A wizard does not have access to any spell he finds.  Instead, he gets certain skill trees, each one of which has no more than 4 or 5 spells.  As you level up, you simply unlock a new tier of the same spell that does slightly more damage.  For instance, at 5th level you can get fireball.  At your next level, you get fireball 2, which does slightly more damage.  It is followed by fireball 3.  All the spells work this way.  Consequently, you will have, at most, about 15 unique spells.\n\nFinally, the main plot is not particularly interesting, the characters don't captivate, and the sidequests are obnoxious.  SCL's biggest failure is its mechanics, but a close second is its failure to pull you into the D&D universe and keep you interested.\n\nIn sum, although I am a huge fan of D&D and CRPGs, I could not bring myself to like this game.  Again, if you want a good D&D-style CRPG, buy Pillars of Eternity.  There is nothing this game offers that Pillars doesn't do better.","October 22, 2015","false","16.3"," 642 of 829 people (77%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","77","642","829","16","29"

This really does. Neverwinter Nights has been around for a long time. A really, really long time, so long in fact there's persistent worlds that still exist to this day that are run by skilled, experienced DMs with running rulesets that you can join and over time become an integral part of the lore if you put the time and effort into. However, Neverwinter Nights -is- getting a bit long in the tooth, the tools were designed for the previous generation, so was the code. As you can imagine, code that's not maintained gets pretty rickety.\n\nSo when it was announced that there was to effectively be a "new" asynchronous DM / Co-op experience where people could gather round and a human Dungeon Master could author their own modules and parcel out rewards, experience, and create their own dungeons. People rubbed their hands in glee, this could well be the answer to the prayers that had been left unanswered since the fateful days of Neverwinter.\n\nSword Coast Legends does not answer those prayers on any level.\n\nHow has it come to this?\nThe game feels ... stodgy. I think that's the best description I've been able to coin for it to date. It's a bit like eating a very bland meal, made of very bland ingredients, that has been prepared by a very bland kitchen and served by a very bland waiter. Everything is design by comittee. There's a very, very bog standard single player campaign where you save the world from an unspeakable evil and it pretty much hits every fantasy cliche along the way without being even remotely memorable. Pillars of Eternity had scale and detail going for it, Original Sin had pants on head silliness, Wasteland 2 at least has BUGS... this? Nothing. I cannot sum up an emotion to express the feeling it elicits. Which is possibly the most damning criticsm of the lot.\n\n"Meh"\n\nWizards of the wallet...\nThen there's the dungeon authoring mode. If this was fully fleshed out and offered the kind of freedom Neverwinter did, then this would forgive a lot of what's been presented. It would forgive the horrible stodgy clickfest UI, the merely servicable graphics, the merely "slightly above average" singleplayer campaign. But it falls down because whoever designed it decided that DM's are 5 year olds. They can only handle predesigned modules where they can plop down monsters, text, scripts and traps.\n\nSpoiler alert, DMs are not 5 year olds. DMs use things like tabletop simulator. They have ... wait for it... an imagination.\n\nThe reason for this cut'n'paste approach? Obvious. DLC which they will no doubt sell in bits and pieces to monetise down the line. "Here have a nautical themed set of modules" "Here have an underground set of modules" , etc, etc. It's lining itself up for the slicing up and selling of what was previously, a market that was not constrained by how big your wallet was, but how big the canvas was in your mind.\n\nThis is not a game that immediately fosters imagination, it fosters the nagging feeling that you're going to need your credit card at the ready, if you want the full toolset, which is, as of the games' release, sadly lacking.\n\nClosing thoughts...\nI came into this game wanting it to be so much more. I wanted the Neverwinter for 2015. Instead I got something that wants my money for very little value. Something that offers less for more. As a result I cannot in good conscience recommend this at any price right now. Maybe down the line I can, when there's more modules and they decide that it should be more sensibly priced, along with steep reductions in the invariably pricey DLC. But right now? Steer well clear.\n\nVerdict : Go back to Neverwinter, there's nothing to see here.\n\nWriter and columnist for Just Reviews, where you can get similar fine reading material. Join our group, follow our curations, and throw me a like if you would like to keep up to date with our efforts!\n\nA followup to [NS]Chrish...\nFirstly, I thank you for taking the time to answer the review. However, there's some key points you fail to address. Whilst you set out to create something that didn't *require* coding or scripting experience to be able to use, the lack of such facilities severely hamper and limit the flexibility of DM's to create truly custom and unique experiences.\n\nFurthermore, the maps provided are not blank canvases, rather, they're premade fabrications and all you can do is seed them with doodads and the like. As you've already stated, -you- have to provide the locations, rather than providing the facilities for DM's to generate their own locations and settings. This severely limits the uniqueness of the setting and the overall ability of the DM to create interesting events.\n\nThis is something that has been highlighted before, and is something that cannot be addressed without a full implementation of scripting and a complete revisit of how buildings are developed (e.g. moving from pre-prepared building assets to a grid system that allows players to set down scriptable walls, furniture, interactables, mobs and doorways with their own characteristics which is much closer to how NWN worked).\n\nThe core SP campaign might not be salvagable, but the DM mode and co-op gameplay that stems from it -can-, if you're willing to change tack and listen to your players. Right now what you're offering is a far cry from what the playerbase wants. I leave it in your hands where you take the Sword Coast Legends.\n\nEDIT : After reviewing your plans as regards ongoing development, you're going -some- of the way, but only some. I'm not sure it will be sufficient, because without at the absolute least some kind of pseudo-scripting system (by this I'm talking some kind of visual building block kind of code approach that allows people to assemble parts of a script, jigsaw like together) that allows people to construct their own event triggers and so on, you're going to limit what people can do to what is prefabricated.\n\nThe kind of complex, interesting, and varied interactions that people were able to create with the NWN toolset were precisely because they had the canvas available, people were trusted to be able to create things and were treated like adults. Skyrim enjoys similar longevity for the same reason. I understand you want to allow approachability but in this case you've traded away too much to get there, and that compromises peoples' creativity.","October 23, 2015","false","0.0"," 697 of 927 people (75%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","75","697","927","32","64"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/prodigalking/recommended/325600/","prodigalking","ProdigalKing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/prodigalking/","11 products in account","A review from a player and comminity mod designer (I will mention those at the end of the review):\n\nFirst off, let me address the past reviews.  Before you put much stock into them, please consider when the reviews were left.  Many, if not the vast majority, were left within the first 7-14 days of release.  These were, in many ways, shock reviews.  Due to the marketing which was actually relatively honest but nonetheless left people with an incorrect expectation.  Since then, an honest analysis of the game for what it is, and much MUCH more transparency in the development cycle and (shameless plug) great support for modifications have helped elevate the game toward where it should have, and still could be.\n\nTo summarize the game:  Yes, it is a D&D 5e based game, but light enough in rules and tedious details and processes, that pepole who haven't spent years or decades playing D&D can still pick it up and get the full experience.  The game places much, MUCH emphasis on the belief that "D&D is an EXPERIENCE" rather than the mundane "D&D is a hard-coded ruleset".\n\nAs a player, you do choose and design your character in a standard D&D fashion.  Race, class, background, alignment, diety, and a skillset reflective of those choices.  You can then play through the story mode, or a constanctly growing amount of player build mods (already over 1000).  Though the game automatically handles your combat based dice rolls, etc., the game does have an in-chat dice function that allows you to roll for all sorts of stat checks, etc.\n\nAs a DM, you can design your module in a much, MUCH friendlier (though admittedly less powerful) fashion than NWN, and as a bonus, can bulid and modify in REAL time.  And, if your DM chooses, he can incorporate the dice rolls, etc. into the adventure to add an even greater amount of RP experience to the table.  (I suggest looking up SpacehamsterBoo or IDJester on Youtube to see great examples of how this is done)\n\nNow.... As for the negatives that the reviewers have mentioned, let me take time to address the more common ones:\n-No Tile-by-Tile dungeon designer.  (The Dungeons are procedurally generated, meaning always different, but random).  The developers have released the roadmap, with the first iteration of the requested editor being designed as we speak, and released in either December or January.\n\n-No dialogue options in created modules.  (The game focues on Live DMs, wherein the DM can handle dialogue in live play, an accurate reflection of D&D tabletop).  HOWEVER, for those who want to design and play stand-alone adventures without a DM, the first iteration of branched dialogue is ALSO being released in either December or January.\n\n-Too many magical items.  This is always being adjusted (Also see mods)\n\n-Scaling monsters.  See mods section.\n\n-Class design.  See mods section.\n-------------------\n\n\nNow, for mods... The developers have presented perhaps the greatest support for mods to date.  In fact, in a personal correspondence, they have agreed to add a small (but critical0 addition to the code for my mod endeavor specifically... It's not even going to be in use in the vanilla version, if that's an indication of the level of mod support N-Space is showing us).\n\nAs for mod accomplishments, here are some mod fixes, just to date:\n\n--Removed scaling monsters and set them completely in accordance with the 5e Monster Manual\n--Unlocked nearly every monster in the single-player mode, including bosses for placement anywhere\n--Readjusted loot tables, to make them fall within 5e structure.\n--Rebalancing of the classes to make them PnP equivalent.  Currently have the Wizard and Fighter totally revised.\n--Additional skills and support for more DM control and PnP equivalency.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, with all that said, if you're looking for a D&D experience, one that you can quickly jump into, and one that is getting better with every single mod and every single developer update, don't hesitate to pick this game up!","November 25, 2015","true","154.5"," 759 of 1,033 people (73%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","73","759","1","35","132"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kriegmeister/recommended/325600/","kriegmeister","Crazy Eyes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kriegmeister/","191 products in account","I gave this game a thumbs-down, but that is because this game's marketing made it a sort of bait-and-switch. The game itself isn't bad, but it's different than what you might expect. Read on to see if the game interests you because I will describe the game as it frankly is.\n\nThis game was carefully marketed to appeal to fans of classic CRPGs like Baldur's Gate and Planescape: Torment without revealing any specifics. In fact, many (including myself) were dissatisfied by the recent Pillars of Eternity and were looking for a good CRPG in this game.\n\nLet me tell you up front: that CRPG successor is not this game. Period. Not even close.\n\nWhat this game is instead, is a hack-and-slash dungeon crawler set in Forgotten Realms and with some inspiration lifted from 5th Edition rules. If I had to analogize the combat rules with actual D&D rules, I would have to say that it is closest to 4th Edition, but it seems obvious that they desiged the combat to flow quickly when played on a computer. I actually quite like the combat (although I loathe 4th on the table, I maintain that it would make a good computer game foundation with some good encounter and dungeon design). It is best described as a "more tactical" variant of hack-and-slash games like Diablo, or perhaps as a faster, streamlined version of the round-based combat in Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights.\n\nCombat flows well, and each class has a well-defined role in the fight. Fail at performing those roles, and the party falls apart and you all die. Rogues seem to be inhuman blenders, shredding everything in sight -- as long as they don't face the business end of a stiff breeze, which frequently comes their way due to their damage output. Wizards can easily leave your entire party unable to do anything, but their death comes just as quickly if not quicker. Fighters and Rangers can actually bully the casters with their chain spear attack ripped straight out of Mortal Kombat. This is the best part of the game and the one that most-resembles D&D; and the parts that don't are usually improvements, at least balance-wise. Oh yeah, and the music's pretty good too.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is lacking in pretty much everything else. I will be honest and say that I played the single player campaign that came with the game for about 30 minutes before I got bored and started rolling random dungeon crawls. The game comes off as designed for pure combat because the dialogue tree is a sort of poor imitation of the robust dialogue systems in games like Planescape: Torment. Yet, bizarrely, the writing and quest-scripting teams seem to have missed this memo. One of the first quests in the game was literally nothing but talking to NPCs. A typical conversation with an NPC consists of the NPC complaining loudly about something, and then you get three dialogue options each of which are dumbly repeating segments of what they just said with a question mark added, like Solid Snake with ♥♥♥♥ing Alzheimer's. Even Icewind Dale -- basically a spin-off of Baldur's Gate that focused mostly on combat, like this game -- had far, far superior character interaction.\n\nAnd hey, wouldn't you know it, as soon as I did nothing but random dungeon crawls the game actually became fun. The AI seems decent, but a tad unreliable, so I decided to try some online crawls. This was the high point. Playing with a real party of other players is definitely what this game is designed for, first and foremost. And yes, I am sure it is not just the "fun with friends" effect, because these people were total strangers. I was playing a giant-killer Ranger and it felt great to be able to yank enemy casters over to me and slam dunk them with my greataxe, and keep my Rogue comrade alive with the occasional Goodberry. I'm in my element here; I love dungeon crawls and team-oriented hack-and-slash. If you like that kind of stuff, consider playing this game. I'm also a bit eager to try out DMing.\n\nMy biggest fear is that the content which seems to be "missing" from this game -- things that are present in D&D but not Sword Coast Legends -- will be sold to us a morsel at a time to nickel and dime us. Things like half-orcs, Barbarian, Monk, and Bard. Monsters like uhhh... ♥♥♥♥ing DRAGONS? Yes. DRAGONS ARE NOT IN THE GAME! I am about 95% sure that it's going to show up as a cool new DLC for five bucks and then I'm probably going to stop playing this game. If they release it as big bundles or expansion packs, I'd be all right with that; I only paid thirty dollars for the base game after all. Here's hoping.\n\nIn short, I guess my conclusion is that you should wait before buying this game. If you like dungeon crawling, then you may very well like this game, but you should probably wait and see if they'll release free content or reasonably-bundled content later on. If you were hoping for a deep and content-rich CRPG with a gripping narrative or really anything besides combat, keep hoping.","October 21, 2015","false","8.6"," 512 of 696 people (74%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","74","512","696","17","27"

This is not, I repeat NOT, a classic D&D game. If you're looking for a new NWN or old school isometric CRPG you won't find it here except in the most shallow of terms. I have neither the time, nor inclination to list its myriad shortcomings. To the point, I feel like I've been hoodwinked. I'm actually of the honest opinion that there's been some sort of payola scandal involved here between some of the game websites and N-space, because the glowing previews don't jibe with the end result. Not. Even. Close. Comparing said articles verus the finished product screams of viral marketing and paid shills to me. Unfortunately because I puchased the game through Green Man Gaming I can't get a refund. So the lessons here are - as usual - do not do day one purchases, do not buy Steam games outside of Steam if you believe you may require a refund - especially from GMG, and as Public Enemy once so wisely said, 'don't believe the hype'.\n\nThe reason for the reviews being so polarized and almost equally split between like and dislike are easy to see when you look at them. The dislikes are from old school players like myself who were hoping for a spiritual successor to NWN. It's what we were promised and what they failed to deliver. The likes invariably seem to come from younger players who are more familiar with ARPGs than CRPGs, unfamiliar with NWN and classic CPRGs, and zero actual PnP experience. From their perspective I could see where this would be a fun game. For those of the old school, not so much.\n\nSo you have been warned.

This is it's own game, and I love it.\n\n***As 1L1NC4 pointed out in a comment:  The expectation of NWN3 or Baldurs Gate inspired goodness may very well be the fault of the marketing department.  They did seem to go through some length to make videos / prerelease information seem like it might be just that.  I wouldn't fault anyone for feeling fooled.  In reference to the DM tools falling short of expectation, I personally do not feel like they did.  I feel like the DM tools are fairly solid, but I can understand pen-and-paper DM's feeling shorted on the matter, since, with the limitations of GUI and such, there are far less options in-game than on paper.\n\nThe story so far has been intriguing, the gameplay is excellent (hardmode seems to be the most DnD like) and the choice of how you want to play is superb.  For a fan of many of the Forgotten Realms novels like myself, the nostalgia of meeting some of your favorite characters and visiting places they visited is absolutely breathtaking.\n\nI love this game and think I will spend many, many more hours in it.

It's your classic MMO-style skill-tree-based RPG. The only thing that resembles D&D is the races and the fact it uses STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS and CHA as stats.\n\n- The fact that the controls suck (for example, there's no way to quickly go to a specific character you want, you have to tab cycle through all your party or click it. We had 1-6 for party characters way back in Baldur's Gate, and F keys for skills, which are mostly unused here),\n\n- The combat is fast-paced, chaotic and it's really hard to actually control what your party is doing, regardless of the pause.\n\n- The game feels unpolished, like a beta version that was shipped out quickly as a proof of concept.\n\n- Online play: yay, let's hack and slash through a randomly generated dungeon filled with generic baddies.

This game feels, at best, an early beta for a Diablo clone with less options. I was most disappointed about the lack of core classes, the way the majic system works (no spell books? skill points for spells was disappointing). Some areas of the game seems very broken. There is no cap on Cooldown Reduction or Action Speed- so you can have a character spamming any skill as fast as they can press the button. (When you consider Meteor Swarm, thats insane). The game is very easy for people to duplicate items from the campaign. A player, with just minimal work, can get well over 1000 charisma score. The game looks and feels very rough- it is not polished and there is no "pop" to any aspect of it. It is mostly bland. As much as I wanted, the story never felt immersive.\n\nI respect the developers for trying to do their own thing, but if this had been a modern adaption/reimagined Neverwinter Nights or Baldur's Gate- the game would be busting at the seams. Instead- WoTC allowed another disappointing game to use the Dungeon and Dragons name to draw in people hopeful for the above mentioned possibility.\n\nI will give the developers credit in that they seem to be doing their honest best to please the community, but unfortunately for me- this game will never be what I was hoping for.","November 23, 2015","false","127.5"," 242 of 345 people (70%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","70","242","345","19","0"

The release seemed incomplete and rushed out the door. However, months later, I find my opinion changing.\n\nBeing a fan of D&D for many years and having ran a Neverwinter Nights server, I looked forward to the reimagining of old modules and my old gameworld. I was shocked to find the functionality of the DM Toolset wasn't half as developed as the Neverwinter Nights Toolset 'out of the box'.\n\nLooking past these flaws however, and working with 'what I have', I dug deeper and was pleasantly surprised.\n\nThis is essentially Neverwinter Nights 3, and with a few more months of development, I can see this game being considered a worthy successor to the previous games. I have created and ran my own module and enjoyed several hours of roleplaying with various players across the globe.\n\nIt works. It maybe clunky in places, but it works. You can run and host fully developed adventures and modules just like a regular pen and paper session, however, those without a brain should not apply. It requires some thought, some planning. Drag and dropping random creatures into a random dungeon, with random encounters, swiftly becomes boring. Developed quests, plotlines and events, brings the game to life.\n\nCompared to other releases branded by WOTC, such as D&D Online, or Neverwinter (MMO), I can honestly say, this is the most authentic D&D computer based experience I have found at this moment in time.\n\nAre you a die-hard D&D fan? Do you want to roleplay, or create and run your own module? Then you will love this game.\n\nLooking for a new roleplaying game to enjoy? Then a certain game with Pillars in it's title would probably serve you better.\n\nDo I recommend this game?

But I waited months before reviewing, so that I could look at the game objectively, and give it as fair of a review as possible.\n\nIf I had never known anything about this game before its release, I would call this a great D&D game. It has a familiar feel, decent graphics, and a fun campaign mode.  I like playing with others and tearing through dungeons. I wouldn't say the game has great depth, but what is there is fun if you like the D&D hack'n'slash games that come in the vein of Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale.\n\nBUT. Since I did know about this game, and was drinking up every promise that was made, and was eagerly awaiting every single feature that was teased, I found this game to be a disaster.  The campaign tools are nothing like what we were promised. They are clunky, unintuitive and so limited that you are left with a terrible dungeon generator.  Not a dungeon EDITOR, a dungeon GENERATOR.  I want freedom to create. I want to make overland maps, I want to shape the rooms of my dungeons, I want to make NPCs that can speak and have conversations.  I WANT TO ASSIGN A DANG LOOT TABLE.  I've been following the patches and they've come up disgustingly short in adding features. Giving me a blank tile and a few trees is not the same thing as an overland map editor.\n\nBecause I, like so many others, wanted this game for the freedom to be able to create environments for people to enjoy, I call this game a failure.  If it had been advertised as a spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate, I would have given it a very high rating.  As it sits, I can only say: Save your money, wait a year, see if they add features.

Good.\nNow, I want you to not think about 'D&D' while looking at the name 'Sword Coast'.\n\nHard, right? Maybe even impossible?\nDon't worry. It was hard for me too, and I still have a hard time getting over the connection between those two names.\n\nBut the thing is:\nIf you have buddies and if you would enjoy having a jolly good RPG cooperative time, overlooking this connection will improve your experience significantly. I repeat: focusing on the fact that this isn't a D&D experience will jump greatly on how much you will enjoy this game.\n\nImagine Icewind Dale but centred on typical/average solid RPG mechanics rather than D&D.\nImagine Dragon Age but with cooperative gameplay.\n\n'Sword Coast Legends' are these two things exactly and more. It is a straightforward, solid 4-man primarily dungeon-crawling RPG experience with minor dungeon master elements and mechanics. All things considered 'D&D' here are translated and streamlined into a more casual and straightforward; I repeat: translated and streamlined. 'Sword Coast Legends' is NOT a 'D&D' game but is still, in fact, good and rich.\n\nYes, 'Sword Coast Legends' is streamlined but solid and good, and I highly recommend it with friends who would be willing to overlook the lack of 'D&D' or who are of those who are just generally interested in jolly good RPG cooperative.\n\nThe gameplay is well-thought and straightforward; nothing complicated here to stimulate those craving for a hardcore experience. The graphics are beautiful. The audio is breathtaking. The story... Is exactly like how Icewind Dale did it (hahahaha); the story just throws at you random plots for you to have more reasons to confront danger and trouble for your RPG-ing needs.\n\nThis game is just that, but it's good at what it does. I will admit to that.\n\nOriginally, having read many of the negative reviews and hearing the hearsay and whatnot, I stayed far away from this game, thinking it was toxic to the new generation in its presentation of D&D; this is true as its marketing was misleading from what I heard (I tend to ignore marketing so I don't know to be exact the brunt of it). However, I decided, one day with friends, to give this game a try and erase my mind, looking at it in a blank slate.\n\nFrankly, even as a fan of Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, the recent Pillars of Eternity and all things beautiful, this game has a certain charm and is good as a game of its own turf.\n\nThere was at one point I giggled greatly, which I hadn't in quite a while, as this game replicates moments of Icewind Dale, Pillars of Eternity, Dungeon Siege and perhaps other dungeon crawlers that tickled my giblets while keeping it at an extreme level of simplicity.\n\nImmediately after hours of having played this game (and, mind you, I have been playing this game on differing chances and not on this account), I bought this game for my account and, as even after purchase, I am looking forward for the many adventures presented to me by 'Sword Coast Legends'.\n\nYes, I recommend this game to anyone who would like to be just carefree and enjoy a RPG.\nNo, this isn't D&D.\nNo, this isn't a complex experience that will constantly keep you immersed.\nNo, it's not perfect nor lives up to expectation.\nBut I had a good time, my friends had a good time and I think you (among others) will too if you're willing to look away and give this game the chance of being apart from a powerful legacy (which being apart is what I think it wholely deserves) - not bringing it down by its setting's D&D background and so on.\nBecause it's still a good game and it still presents a good fun and, sometimes, challenging experience.\n\nRecommended.","April 30","true","88.8"," 64 of 77 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","64","77","6","0"

If you like rpg-lite games with click and watch, not very interactive combat that isn't good, and lots and lots of not good combat, you will like this game.  If you like more traditional heavy crpgs such as D:OS, Watselands 2, AoD,  MMX, ToEE, PoE, etc, and tend to stay clear of the hack n slash games or rpg-lite games, you probably won't like this game.  I sure don't.\n\nIt isn't an arpg since arpgs have very interactive combat.  The combat in this game is click on a bad guy and watch your party engage in combat while being bored and occassionally use an ability.  All abilities are on crazy long CDs.\n\nIf I had to compare it to another game, I would have to compare it to Kyn but with much longer CDs, or to the older console Baldurs Gate: Dark Alliance games.  The original Dungeon Siege is a really good example too.  It is pretty much a straight dungeron romp like a arpg but with RT, non-action combat.\n\nIs this game 5th edition?  No, not even a little.  It is a made up edition that does not remotely resemble 5th edition.  The race and class selections are decent, but they share mini talent trees.  For instance, the fighter and thief share 3 mini-trees (or two for certain that I can remember), same for all classes.  Spells are abilities you pick from the tree and upgrade in the mini tree (so like spell whatever 1-3, 3 being more powerful and requiring a higher level and more skill points to purchase, but the CDs are aways way too long on everything to make the game even remotley interactive).\n\nThere is no multiclassing since the classes share trees and multiclassing is built in.  Thieves can purchase heavy armor, etc.\n\nThe UI was clearly ment for consoles and controllers with console maps, a list for an inventory, annoying everything for KB+M players on the pc.\n\nI can recommend this game to people looking for a multiplayer mindless romp, or for people who enjoyed the very succesful and popular Dungeon Siege and don't mind a console interface and console gameplay.  For people looking for a heavier crpg experience I cannot recommend this at all.\n\nGod Bless steam's return policy.","October 20, 2015","false","11.4"," 531 of 826 people (64%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","64","531","826","18","17"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Masterchiefs/recommended/325600/","Masterchiefs","Belegarssøn #fafnirhype","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Masterchiefs/","951 products in account","The first thing about Sword Coast Legends that impressed me was the haunting score, epic tracks that gave a real sense of adventure that you can expect from a fantasy world. No surprise, OST was made by Inon Zur.\n\nBut that, along with authentic atmosphere and somewhat interesting plot, is pretty much the only good things about SCL.\n\nSo, SCL was advertised as a classic RPG in the vein of DnD. However, what I actually got is a Diablo-ish title with real time w/ pause combat system and a lot of mainstream ARPGs' cliché. This is a game that caters to that kind of audience that prefers fast-paced action games with role-playing elements. I'm not saying that's bad thing, but if you put "Sword Coast" in your title, and claiming "complex RPG" and "tactical combat" in your description, you better deliver at least one signature part of the CRPG genre.\n\nI'm currently swinging through the game at Hard mode, yet the game rarely gives me any challenge at all. First, enemies scale to your level, that means leveling is worthless since everything you face against levels up with you. With the combat system, there's no "strategic" element like positioning in Pillars of Eternity for example, you only need to choose which abilities you'll use and try to stay alive as long as possible. These require little to no tactic at all because nearly all battles in this game come down to popamole style where you eliminate each enemy in the same vein with no creative ways to dispatch them all. Sword Coast Legends also doesn't punish player from dying, because you can control a party member to stabilize a teammate in 5 seconds with no cost at all.\n\nControl is awful, party members sometimes ignore my command and do whatever action that automatically set for them. For example, my wizard companion really likes to target an enemy from medium range, I tried to move him away but nope, his previous action is being executed, so he has to cast spell on that enemy then ran away, which risked him into getting in closed-combat. This also applies to special attacks, where my characters refuse to follow my command and attack enemies casually instead. Also, as sensitive as party members AI can be at times, sometimes they will ignore enemies and do nothing while teammates are struggling against another enemy until I manually control them, or sometimes 3 members move from point A to point B, but member #4 stands still at point A because somehow he ignore my team command.\n\nSkill trees and stats... where am I supposed to start here, stats are pretty much the same things you expect from a standard RPG, but I wonder will they affect my characters drastically while the enemies scaling appears in this game. With skills, most of them boils down to tiers, higher tiers mean better skills in number, like this fire spell at level 1 deals 10 dmg and 20 dmg at level 2 for example. The game shows at least 4 or 5 trees for each classes, but most of the skills are pretty much uninspiring, not too different than those magical spells you always see in fantasy RPGs. With melee skills, I wonder whether they actually work, because when I click those icons, they start a cooldown, but I see no visual impact whatsoever.\n\nAnything else? The mundane sidequests that made me feel like playing a MMO, from mundane to ridiculous ♥♥♥♥♥ like collecting mushroom, finding missing people or bringing a sword back to a guy. Pathfinding is sometimes buggy, attack animations are horrid, Dungeon Master mode is painfully simple, HUD is unresponsive especially in dialogues, dialogues only follow certain paths and rarely change the outcome, and why the hell the screen has to fade into black and then show the conversations? Talking about wasting time...\n\nSword Coast Legends feels like a game that didn't catch up at all, a title that if had been released 2 or 3 years ago might have been a decent hit that could be remembered as a part of the CRPG renaissance. But right now, it just feels like a game born in an inapproriate era where there are already titles that do everything better than it can. A game that played it too safe, and this legend should be forgotten for better or worse.","November 2, 2015","false","11.1"," 130 of 188 people (69%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","69","130","188","7","1"

It's one of the few times I've been super exicted about a game being released, and then very disappointed how that release turned out.  Having said that, I still enjoy the game and there is a lot of fun to be had but it's not without its issues.  I believe the game will get a lot better as the Devs continue to add additional content and fix bugs.\n\nPOSITIVE:\n\nStory is fun and worth playing through.  Humor is entertaining and light-hearted.\nCompanions each have unique personalities and I thought the voice acting was good\nCustom monsters is a blast - it's fun trying out different combinations of abilities and coming up with unique monsters.\nBuilding a module - This has really brought out the creative side in me again.  Coming up with a story, using props and npcs to tell the story.  It can be a lot of fun and you can really spend a lot of time and get pretty deep into it if you want.\nDungeon Master - This is the most fun in the game personally for me.  I love the delicate balance of trying to create a challenge for people, but not overwhelming them to the point where it's not fun.  Being able to create monsters and a dungeon on the fly is a unique experience which is quite the rush.  You can also roleplay through your npcs & monsters with /s if you want to talk through them adding to roleplay.\nIf you are able to find a live dungeon master it will completely change your view of this game.  There's so many more things a live dungeon master can do versus a game without a live dungeon master.  It enhances the multiplayer experience ten fold.\nDev Team cares about their game and are open to feedback and suggestions from players (This is actually a pretty big one.  I've joined several of their Twitch streams and have always been impressed by how open and honest the team is.  They are also very good at responding directly to my questions about the game)\nIf you just want to hop in and create a short adventure, you can do that with a few simple steps.  Easy access to dungeon crawls.\n\nNEGATIVE:\n\nThe story is fun, however it does suffer from getting too easy after level 10 or so.  Certain abilities can be stacked that can make combat less challenging.\nCertain abilities in skill trees aren't as powerful as they should be.  Fireball should be a lot more powerful as should some other spells.\nCreating a module can be frustrating at times when dealing with collision issues when placing objects.  There are some other limitations to what you can do as well, so there is not total freedom to do whatever you want as of yet.\nMagic Loot, Potions, and Consumables are way too common adding to the game becoming too easy eventually and gold becomes less valuable since you have plenty of it.\nNot many different armor models / unique looks, could use a little more variety.\nThe outdoor areas used in Module Creation are mostly taken from the campaign areas.  Some of them include preset structures and land scaping which makes it hard to shape the area to how you want it at times.\nModules without live DMs are too limited by what they can do at this time, lacking triggers and scripts.\n\nIf you come to the game with an open mind and play multiplayer with a live DM you'll probably have a great time.  If you want a hardcore, tried and true D&D game you might be a little disappointed.  The game plays more in real time and there are skill trees for characters instead of the usual D&D style.   Multiplayer without a Dungeon Master can be kind of lack-luster while games with a dungeon master are a lot of fun and that's the part of the game I really enjoy.  It's a unique experience that most other games don't have.  The ability to change the game on the fly and spawn / create your own dungeon crawl.  The game still has some issues, but it is changing as time goes along.  There are mods that have been created now to make the game feel a little more D&D for those that want that.\n\nOverall I have a great experience whenever I play, but that could be in part because I like being the dungeon master.  You will certainly get your money's worth playing the campaign but the multiplayer is where the replayability comes in.","December 2, 2015","true","358.4"," 186 of 278 people (67%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","67","186","278","9","0"

If you play with strangers or solo in anything outside of the main campaign, maybe not so much. The toolset is limiting at present, but with a bit of creativity on the part of the DM (and willing players) - you will find it actually is quite a good interpretation of PnP. The game gives you the option to play it in a hack-n-slash way, or with deeply involved RP - just make sure you are grouped with people that understand what you want out of the game and it will work for you.\n\nIf we were to draw comparisons on games - it's like a mix between NWN and DA:O. It's less "fully-featured" than NWN in terms of mechanics and toolset, but the similarities are there. Just beware of this going in.\n\nGraphically it is pretty good. Nothing to write home about, but it does what it does well enough. The music and sound is really good as well. Most main campaign quest dialogue is voiced, while other side-quests are not. There are no cutscenes for dialogue, the camera instead moves down nearer to the characters as speech takes place.\n\nModule Creation\nThe module creation toolset is okay. It is fairly limited at present (nowhere near the complexity of the NWN toolset, for instance). You can create/select areas based on pre-defined tilesets and place objects, creatures and the like in the area. Dungeons are randomly generated, based off several initial factors, such as difficulty, complexity, tileset, monster set etc. Once generated, you can then visit the area and further customise it to your liking, including adding bosses, quests, NPC,s and objects. The predefined quests are "kill boss", "kill monsters" and "collect materials" - which you can quickly assign and customise to your liking. There is also a custom quest generator to give you greater control over the quests. You can create monsters, NPC's and characters to add to your adventures - all with lots of customisation options such as appearance, abilities and attributes. You can even create custom creature sets. Modules can be uploaded to share with others in the world - and downloaded just as easy. This gives you instant access to a wealth of community content (with ratings), ensuring there is always something new to experience and will extend your play-time dramatically.\n\nDungeon Master\nThe DM mode is another important feature to the game. Here you get to play as a "fifth character" (of sorts). In this mode, you don't control a party member or contribute to the game in a normal way, instead you take control of the other players experience - by customising it as they play. This can be in the form of adding or removing monsters, placing objects, setting up quests, possessing creatures and the like. This is where the game really opens up into much more of a roleplaying game. The way in which the players interact with the challenges the DM poses are key to the game - and as any D&D player will tell you, key to PnP (Pen and Paper) gaming as well. For example: you may have a locked door and a custom NPC guarding it. As the DM, you can talk to the players through this NPC - getting them to possibly roll a diplomacy check to appease the NPC. If the party fails, you could turn the NPC hostile and a fight will ensue. Another example: your party is crossing a bridge. As the DM, you can pause the game and ask the players to roll a spot check. If they fail you could spawn a hidden assassin to ambush them. The possibilities are endless - and the DM role is very important in this game. It's also quite a lot of fun to boot. DM's can be rated on three different categories (out of 5) - which players get to do at the end of a session. This means that you will hopefully know what you are in-for with a DM you do not know.\n\nCampaign\nThe campaign has an interesting story and is enjoyable. It's fairly lengthy and should provide at least 30 hours of entertainment (dependant on the number of side-quests you do). Most of the things that are "missing" from module creation are present here - such as branching dialogue, skill checks and custom areas. Companions are fully voiced, as is the main quest "path". Some of the voice acting is superb. It also features a novel addition whereby you are not forced to bring along certain party members if you don't want them, but they can still interact with you or talk to NPC's as if they were there. This means you are not forced to bring a party member along just for fear of missing something. You can play the campaign co-op with up to 3 friends as well, which is great fun.\n\nThe Ruleset DebacleThe game's interpretation of 5th Edition rules caused a lot of people to get upset. The game says that it is "based on 5th edition", which is very true. It's not an exact translation of 5th edition rules - but they are there. Things have been changed, perhaps not all of them for the best. Most notable changes include resting, skill trees and cooldowns. Resting was removed because it's a PITA in a computer game - and cooldowns for skills were brought in offset the loss of the rest system. Skill trees seem to be a bugbear for a lot of people too - mainly the lack of Wizard spells and the way in which you use ability points to "level-up" existing abilities. One more thing required a mention here - level scaling. Currently, all enemies in the game are scaled to your level. This is something that does not exist in D&D. Their reason behind doing this is so that you can hop across modules and never have an issue with under/overpowered monsters. This is, of course, not to everyone's tastes. For instance, you can come up against a level 20 Goblin that proves quite a challenge, where-as in D&D you would be able to mow down Goblins by the dozen at level 20.\n\nImportant Question #1: Can you forgive/put aside rule alterations?\n\nThe "it's not real D&D" DebacleA lot of people have got quite worked up over this. The argument by some is that this game is not a "real D&D game". I say, that is complete rubbish. D&D means different things to different people, but I have always seen D&D as a social game with friends. If you play/treat the game like this, then it is very D&D. Lay aside the differences between PnP and a computer game - of which it is inevitable there will be some. All-in-all, the game does a very good job of adapting it - mainly because of the possibilities it opens up with module creation and a live DM. A live DM is the heart and soul of the game - and make it a much better experience.\n\nThe lore, races, classes, monsters, feel and spirit of D&D is all here.\n\nImportant Question #2: Do you plan to play this game like you would PnP (with a group of friends and a good DM)?\nImportant Question #3: Do you even care about D&D (if not, you will probably enjoy it anyway)?\n\nSummaryIf you will complain when a game does not translate D&D rules to the letter, you will probably be disappointed. If you are a little more forgiving, there is lots of enjoyment to be had here. If you have a good group of friends to play with - and a good DM, the game also becomes infinitely better. That's not to say it is not a good game without one, but you truly haven't experienced it at its full potential until you have played in this way. If you are here as a solo player then the main campaign may interest you, but outside of that, you may not get as much out of the game.\n\nThe game is brimming with potential, but it boils down to how you play it, to whether you will enjoy it or not. It's not NWN 3, but it is a solid D&D game that will keep you entertained for quite some time. The developers are very active and listen to suggestions - with any luck they will continue to improve the game post-release.\n\nJimbo Rating: 8/10","October 20, 2015","true","26.1"," 237 of 361 people (66%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","66","237","361","6","18"

The UI is far better than any D&D or D20 (or D20-inspired) game that I've previously played.\n\nI also know, from decades of bitter experience, that slavish adherence to any D&D ruleset is a very good way to build a very bad game.

I believe it was about a year ago that Hasbro/TSR/WoTC had a DM-able game. thinking logical progression that would be amazing. Alot of times I've had many many gaming groups (even just casual ones) break up due to time, irl issues and the logistics of everyone getting time off and being able to (and feeling like) hauling their rear over to a common place to geek out. I instantly got 2 pre-orders when I heard of this from.. Slashdot.com I think it was.\n\nI would like to say this game so far, fails in almost every aspect. Without the nugget that this actually adheres to a d20 gaming system (which by default is hidden, and keeps defaulting back to hidden) Minor bugs, and barely passible graphics. The game play is terrible. Unless you plan on pausing the game ever 5 seconds to re apply skills, manually (not turn based) which make this game a mediocre to ugly looking free for all, based on a 'official dnd' gaming system, that isn't fun to play, and isn't appealing to the eye and has none of the feeling of 5th edition dnd, or a good rpg.\n\nAlot more was promised here aside from a poor looking Pillars of Eternity mimic. Unfortunatley this seems to be the same path Wizards of the Coast is doing with the Magic the Gathering franchise aswell, hiring mediocre game coders/designers or simply putting them on too limited of a budget to do anything more than superficial games with no real thought or depth to them.\n\nClasses aren't implimented properly.. Rogues fully buffed can solo most encounters; all classes heal (clerics pretty much obsolete), no tactics.. just a really ugly looking isometric rpg with a very clunky non-intuitive UI, with point click and smashing (yes even wizards aside from the occasion spell on a cool down timer)\nComparitive immersion think.. Diablo 3 .. Barbarian. attack. button mash so you hit the 'skill' everytime cool down expires. Pause. Drink potions when you get low.\n\nI'm a large fan of DnD myself get yourself some dice and a couple books and dive in. it's amazing. This poor excuse for a game falls short on -all- of these promises, I've seen Android games match the graphics/character customization and depth of this game. DnD based or not; this was not the immersive bring your buddies with you and have a gaming session that was promised. I'm hoping this changes.. but at this point I highly doubt it.\n\nBig Thumbs down Hasbro;\nShape up or just throw in the towel and retire it.\n\nMy thoughts;\nNot yours.\n\nUpdate: 10/24/2015\nSword Coast Legends posts link to game review:\nhttp://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/10/21/sword-coast-legends-review/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rockpapershotgun%2Fsteam+%28Rock%2C+Paper%2C+Shotgun%3A+Steam+RSS%29\n\nDirect quotes from gaming review linked by the developer in steam:\n"Clearly this was only a brief glance, but it wasn’t one that has given me any inclination to dig any deeper. It seems we still desperately need someone to come up with the ultimate AD&D online DMing extravaganza, cos this ain’t it.”\n\nand/or\n\n"It’s definitely best to think of Sword Coast Legends not as Dungeons & Dragons (let alone AD&D) and more as a sort of low-key DIY Diablo. Even then, the core combat is too forgettable, and the DM mode too limited, to make a solid case for playing this instead of co-op Diablo or Torchlight or Titan Quest or Path of Exile if monster-bothering with chums is what you’re after. It’s not impossible that later updates will make fighting feel less underwhelming or expand the potential of dungeon-building, but I wouldn’t want to bet on it.\n\nIt’s absolutely true to say that you get out of Sword Coast Legends what you put in, but right now there just aren’t enough reasons to put much in."\n\nProfessional game critics linked by the game developer, don't just take my word on it; take the link; if your a real hardcore DnD fan wait for this game to hit the 10$ cheapy bin on steam in record time.","October 22, 2015","false","0.8"," 146 of 223 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","146","223","3","2"

DMing is pretty streamlined and functional. Story is a bit better than expected (Not on par with some other cRPGs)\n\nI purchased this game with to create modules and run them with friends.  Nspace alluded to there being more to the DM Tools/Tilesets/etc  than what was streamed (and what was in the headstarts) by the time of release.  There was a wee bit more, but not much.   I am extremely disappointed in the DM Tools for a Module Creation standpoint.  I didn't expect NWN level customization, but I wanted and thought I would be getting quite a bit more.   I am leaving out complaints about Branching Dialogue and Tile-by-Tile.  I was okay with no Tile by Tile because I thought there would be ample tilesets included.  Anyway, based on release, my main criticisms:\n\nLack of transparency from Developer.\n\nLack of creatures - no Orcs, no Kobolds, no giants, no dragons (it's in the freaking name)....  the disappointment goes on and on.\n\nLack of Areas - Only a few were added which I just cannot understand.  No village and/or town tilesets. There is a very big lack in depth and variety here.\n\nLack of customized creature sets - I can only customize a creature set by changing their colors/weapons/armor.  I cannot make a set of 10 different looking Drow Fighters nor can I pick and choose what creatures I want in my custom set.\n\nLack of weapons and model variety -  No warhammers?!?  There is no 2-8 damage Bludgeoning weapon to compete with the 2-8 damage slashing and poking options.  No flails either... most of the weapons kind of look meh, almost too fantasy. There is a general lack of models for Mauls and Great Axes (greataxe looks pretty bad with the huge blades and short handle btw).\n\nI've only played a few hours of the Story and so far it's been better than expected.

While it adopts some of the superficial trappings of D&D, it lacks most of the gameplay elements that people associate with the brand. From building a character, to exploring a dungeon, to talking to NPCs, it all feels more like a mediocre action-RPG than a D&D game. The combat is a poorly executed "real time with pause" system in which you'll spend most of your time on boring auto-attacking while hitting your cooldowns when they become available. It's lacking in strategy beyond the basic stuff and the singleplayer campaign is dull, poorly written and lacking in interesting conversations, choices, or storylines.\n\nAnd you know what, I could almost be ok with that. After all, we've got the wonderful DM mode to save the game, right? The brilliant thing about NWN was that you could make your own adventure, and then let friends or strangers play through it while you take the role of "dungeon master". Or you could craft a single-player adventure that didn't need a DM and relied on your scripting and dialogue-writing to create an exciting adventure. Or, yet another option, you could even create your own persistent server, and have your own little MMO world inside the game.\n\nUnfortunately, SCL does absolutely none of that. The DM mode is nothing but a bad joke. Even Neverwinter Online (an actual MMO!) has a far better level editor than SCL does. What DM mode boils down to is you choose a generic dungeon out of one of several styles, and then you occasionally drop down some monsters, traps and loot while watching your players hack and slash their way through. That's it. You can't create your own levels, you can't do any scripting, you can't use your own assets to surprise the players. You can't even customise the loot you drop for the players. You just create some monsters in a randomly generated generic dungeon, so your players have something to hack to death for XP. Ding!\n\nSo the only real draw of SCL remains the co-op hack-and-slash experience. Which, I have to admit, is more fun than the rest of the game simply because it's co-op. But even that has some serious flaws. It doesn't matter how well you do in combat, because dying doesn't matter. You can get revived almost instantly with no penalties, and even if the whole party dies you all just respawn. There's also no loot system. All loot goes to the one who picks it up, which is especially awful if you're playing with strangers, because often one guy will just run ahead and open all chests and drops, leaving you with almost nothing.\n\nIf that sounds like your idea of a good RPG, then by all means, SCL might just be the game for you. Personally, I'm just really glad that SCL isn't a representation of what RPGs are these days, and that there are many, many better options in the recent past and near future that are actually worth my time.","October 20, 2015","false","22.8"," 117 of 177 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","117","177","2","0"

The online community for the game doesn't really exist when it comes to playing with randoms on the internet to go through the main campaign or any of the custom made campaigns made by other people. Good news, there are plenty of campaigns made by other players for the game so you have additional content to go through if you do manage to get through the game, sadly a lot of this custom content requires you to put together a party, or in most cases convincing your friends to buy the game. When look at this game as a video game, I think it's a decent RPG for the most part. However when considering it an adaptation of D&D or any kind of spiritual sucessor to Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter Nights you will be very dissapointed. If you want to play the game I recomend you try and convince some of your friends to jump into it aswell so you can do all the content together and have a blast.

The combat is drearily uninteresting, with most of your characters doing actions and casting spells automatically if you aren't controlling them, which is the antithesis to tactical strategy.  The spells and abilities learned in this game seem borrowed from a AAA RPG like Elder Scrolls, since they are tiered in a similar way that has certain requirements, which seems ridiculous seeing as how the developer had the rights to use the rulesets from D&D.  Why would they choose to instead use an extremely generic skill and attribute system; why would they use simplified, safe combat; why does everything in this game feel like it is made to be as safe as possible so as to appealing to the most amount of people?

I told my friends to ignore the nay-sayers on Steam and that the devs would come through for us fans.\nSadly, I have since requested a refund.\nHere is why;\n\nThe game is an overt attempt at making a DIABLO 3 clone but it isn't executed well at all;\n- The graphics, even with all settings blazing full-blast, look like something out of a Playstation 2.\n- The gameplay is stale, utterly boring, and the UI is a mess of hotkeys and abilities ala a sloppily organized WoW HuD.\n- The numbers behind the scenes are waaay off kilter. For instance, a minor boss will absolutely destroy a even a full 4-player group over and over again as the players run feaverishly about trying to "rez" each other with healing kits. It leaves a player going "Boy, this just isn't fun at all" while simultaneously wondering whether the devs did any work whatsoever in balancing this aspect of the game.\n- Treasure and loot is a random mismash of potions, jewels, and gear that is so sloppily presented that about 1/2 my inventory after a dungeon crawl were items that I had no idea how I acquired.\n\nIt is with great regret and sincere sadness that I must give this game a thumbs down.\nIt had so much potential and so much promise, all of it squandered by sloppy and unpolished production value.","October 22, 2015","false","0.5"," 136 of 218 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","136","218","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrokeMyNinja/recommended/325600/","BrokeMyNinja","☣ Ninja NutJob ☠","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrokeMyNinja/","711 products in account","First thing I should say is I have about 55hrs in the Headstart and currently 6hrs in Launch. My head start campaign was carried over into Launch. Yes, I am taking my time playing and looking in every nook and cranny of the main story. Sadly my Headstart Achievements didnt carry over. No big deal, I plan on playing through multiple times.\n\n- This game is not, never was advertised as, nor was ever going to be in the style a turn based DnD game exactly like any of the old Icewind Dales/Baldurs Gates/Planescapes/Neverwinter Nights etc, including the recent Pillars of Eternity. It is certainly NOTHING like the abomination Daggerdale. If you followed any information that was posted on the official website, were part of the forums or even played/watched friends in the alpha/betas you would know this. Also I do not claim to know all of the details of DnD Game Rule Sets, honestly I have forgotten most of them over the years.\n\n- Its Both an Action RPG and a Classic RPG, with some of the BASIC rules of the DnD rules depending on how you set your games options. Yes, it still follows a mild amount of rules in the background. I realize that being an Action RPG will quickly be referenced that its like a Diablo game, only if you go into the game options and start removing all the 'Pause' ticks and the RP options that affect the actual Roleplay part to make it a Classic style RPG like Neverwinter Nights (NOT THE NEVERWINTER MMO!). Pausing on certain actions doesnt complete make it a CRPG but it does help with keeping the feel of one.\n\n*** Character customization is not as big as it couldve been so far, it is fairly nice, but not the best in any DnD videogame. It has the 5 races to choose from, none of the ADnD races like Teiflings. Still get your racial passives, select your class, alignment, optional Deity, background.\n\n- Races, 5 to choose from. More will be available in the future to choose from in the future per discussion between Trudge (SCL Dev) and MMORPG.com.\n\n- Classes are the 6 basic classes to choose from. There will be more classes to choose from in the future per discussion between Trudge (SCL Dev) and MMORPG.com\n\n- Attribute System is the core character sheet DnD mechanic and works well with the games RP dialog, world/dungeon checksum mechanics and both crpg & arpg combat.\n\n- Skill System follows the rules of the DnD Combat Rules with its Pass/Fail checks. Instead of rolling out a List of Skills to choose from like the godfathers of the DnD universe have originally layed out, the skills were instead layed out into multiplay skill trees to choose from. Depending on what class you chose, you always get the main 'Skills & Proficiencies' tree, a 'Secondary Weapon' (class specific) tree, 'Martial Ability' tree and your classes 4 ability trees. These 4 trees would look similar as a way to 'Multispec' your abilities. Just my opinion.\n**i.e. - My first Character is a Ranger\n- Primary Weapon Tree is ' Archery'\n- Secondary Weapon tree is 'Two-Handed Weapon'\n- 4 Skill trees to choose from are Hunting, Beast Master, Hunting & Warden\nNow as you & your companions (any you successfully recruit) level up, every level you get 3 ability points in which you can spec into any starting ability node or advanced node provided the prerequisite ability is unlocked or you meet the level requirement to unlock it. Primary and Subprimary branch skills require 2pts to activate. Advanced Skills from lv9 or higher require 3 pts to unlock. Also every few levels you level up in you get to add 2 attribute points to your characters, should be a no brainer for familiar DnD fans.\n\n- Companions in the Campaign are are quite useful and include some of the classes we are not allowed to play as (currently) like Hommet the Necromancer.\n\n- Combat system depending on how your options are set will always be on an active timer. Its not a Turn Based system, though you can simulate it with interaction pauses from the options menu -\n- i.e. your character finishes an ability it will pause and you can queue the next action.\nAlso under the avatars of your party members is a small box to engage Solo and let the A.I. automatically control your party members, except for who you are currently selected, or click it to enable yourself to control all of your parties abilities and only let them do generic attacks.\n\n- Loot system has a set list of items but 90% of the npc drops and chests loot tables are randomly generated loot. So starting a dungeon or reloading a dungeon unless it was already cleared will refresh and randomize the loot tables.You never get the same loot in a chest you opened unless its quest related. Ive not encountered any *Godlike* items, especially from Named & Unique items. It all just depends on how you want to deck out your Heroes.\n\n- Campaign Story is your typical be the hero(es) and save the world. Your RP dialog options for most of it keep the story entertaining enough. Its not a perfect story, but its above average considering. I believe it has enough to maintain replayability for most. If not at least to replay the campaign with friends in 4 player co-op mode.\n\n- Solo Campaign Companions are actually useful and provide entertaining dialog as well as their companion side quests. You find more lore for them and why they are part of your journey.\n\n- Co-op is where youll maximize your entertainment, usually with friends or a friendly group of randoms. You have a choice of...\n- Co-Op Campaign mode which brightens the replayability if not enhances the first time play through of it.\n- Module Campaign mode which is customized campaigns & modded campaigns.\n- Dungeon Crawl mode which consists of randomly generated fungeons! (Get it? Fun... Dungeon? Fungeon! Its a play on words. - King Candy)\n\n- There is also DM mode, where you can create your own Campaigns, dungeons as well as moderate them while others are exploring them, adding in extra spawns & traps dynamically changing the experience for everyone. I hear its not the most advanced toolset for the current day and age. Especially from those who have used the Neverwinter Night 1 toolset which I agree that was really advanced for its day. Its definitely usable and fun. I think it was simplified to for more people to use it and keep the Lore of the 'Legends' part of the Sword Coast continuing through our adventures.\n\n- The camera and screen panning could definitely use some work, though youll likely get used to how it is until the patch some fixes. Until then the only was is with WASD on the keyboard.\n\n- There is a chat system including basic keyboard chat, as well as a party audio chat for those grouping dungeoneers. Useful imo if everyone else figured out how to use it lol.\n\n- Now there is a decent amount of humor and 'Easter Eggs' referencing past titles in the Sword Coast lore. I.e. if any of you remember Lilarcor (BG1), Enserric (NWN-HotU), you might find something upstream if you explore your options next  time you use your brains when youre in town.\n\nAll being said despite what I see as "Confused Negative Reviews", this game works as intended, a few manageable flaws yes, game breaking though? No, it just depends on the type of game you are looking for and how you want to play it.\n"... And The Choice is Yours" - Socucius Ergalla\n\n7.5/10  in its current standing...

As others said, the skills are hidden behind progression bars, casters can cast their spells without a limit... if this was meant to follow in the footsteps of other legendary D&D titles, it should have stayed true to the rules and system implementations. As it is, my caster just spams the best spells and waits until the cool down has worn off. No need to rely on the cantrips in order to save the big guns up for the next big encounter.\n\nAlso, 5th E is a lot richer than what we have been given. Yes, it is understandable to go with the core classes and a foundation, but it diminishes the rich options which are already in the core handbook. As many others, I hope the DLCs are more than just "you want race X and class y? Cough it up!" or are actually free add-ons if they have nothing more to add.\n\nI think hoping for rule changes towards the true D&D system with spell slots and resting is too late, but you may never know... other games have tweaked their mechanics before... ah well.\n\nStill a decent game all in all, but I can't recommend it to folks who ask for a real D&D CRPG experience.","October 21, 2015","false","7.3"," 110 of 179 people (61%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","61","110","179","5","0"

It was also priced a bit optimistically, in a premium price bracket.\n\nIt ultimately ended up a solid, broad, if fairly shallow D&D rpg with a typically guff fantasy storyline, uncommonly decent voice acting and some good writing (I laughed out loud a bunch of times). Combat itself is pretty simple, even if there's a good amount of variety available through abilities and the different characters you simultaneously control. It looks quite pretty (although animations aren't super), is polished and sports a robust and unique multiplayer mode which - while a long way from being the digital tabletop many apparently expected - is still a good bit of creative dungeon-crawling fun in its own right.\n\nYou'll want to bring friends or family in to be able to explore the multiplayer though, there isn't much action if you're hoping to play with strangers. It really is something that works best with people you know anyway. Perfect for say, running a custom dungeon with your kids or good friends, to whet their appetites for tabletop roleplay.\n\nAdd to that an accessible dungeon/adventure kitset and it makes a very complete package for any game, let alone from a small developer on a budget. The tools are fun to experiment with, particularly if you're interested in dipping your toes into making your own things but have no scripting or modding experience.\n\nAt the release price I can understand people being disappointed, but at $20-30 it's excellent value and an absolute steal if on sale - a great all-round rpg package and highly recommended.\n\nIt's a shame the game was such a financial bomb and the devs went out of business.

I do not care for the MP aspect. Plenty of other reviews for that.\n\nI do not feel that the negativity towards this game is warranted. I have played many RPGS over the years. I am no stranger to the D&D ruleset. Most complaints are centered around the fact that this is an "adaptation" of the ruleset of the 5th edition(IIRC) and that it doesnt feel 'D&D" enough for their taste. That is just it. It boils down to taste. Once you can accept that this wont be the next great D&D RPG then I say that you will find an enjoyable RPG waiting to be played.\n\nThe primary similarities that I could point you towards is that this game feels like the companion system of Dragon Age: Origins(the camp at night where you talk to your party members) mixed with Neverwinter Nights 1-2 exploration and adventuring(minus the constant resting to replenish abilities) mixed with a more colorful presentation of the world(I keep thinking of Divinity: Original Sin) mixed with storyline elements taken from Baldurs Gate(Not spoiling that for you).\n\nThere are a LOT of similarities, but there is also a few differences. Let me boil them down to pros/cons\n\nPros;\n\n+good story. I like what I am seeing so far. I see story elements from alot of different games that I have played in the past.\n+the sound is good and the music is pleasing to the ear.\n+I find the companions to be genuinely interesting and they are vibrant and alive. There is immersive dialogue that I frankly did not expect.\n+combat is fluid. I mean fluid. Doesnt actually feel clunky.\n+the graphics are pleasing to the eye. Nothing revolutionary, but well-done for what they set out to accomplish. The game looks better while you play it than compared to watching a video online.\n+character specialization is done with a "talent tree". You get skill points like you would in any D&D game and then you spend those on abilities. First to unlock it and then to "upgrade" it if you choose. You also get attribute points in traditional fashoin as you level up.\n\nIt should be noted that this is a major contention with a lot of people, but it is really no different than what Pillars of Eternity did with their own "feats" system. Yes, it was more traditional, but everything from that game was their own "adaptation" of the abilities from D&D anyways. It depends on how you look at it. It works and if your one of those people who get really irked when something traditional is changed...then perhaps you might not like it...but then again...it might grow on you. It certainly did for me.\n\nI would also like to talk about "difficulty". I played on Normal for four hours. Everything was a real breeze. I hardly pressed spacebar to pause the action at all. I then tried Hard difficulty; that is where the real challenge is. I found myself constantly pressing the spacebar to micro-manage every ability usage to have my party members survive. Seriously, its like they went over hard difficulty to make sure you had a challenge with almost every encounter.\n\nCons;\n\n+/-many people do not like adapations of traditional gameplay systems. I think this criticism is personal, but that is no reason to trash the game. For what it sets out to do; they did really well. Once you get used to the system...it works fluidly. Its a matter of taste, but I didnt hear alot of people complain about Pillars of Eternity's system that was clearly heavily inspired even more with D&D than this one was; the only difference is that this has "Sword Coast" in the name.\n\n+/-you can "res" your party members in the middle of combat an unlimited number of times by "stabilizing" them. That could go either way. It helps to keep the game going, but sometimes you cannot recover and sometimes you can. It does cut down on the reloading.\n\n-there is only one save slot per character. Seriously. That gripes the hell out of me. I have to make absolutely sure every descision I make is what I want before I eventually move on. I save before every quest turn in or every encounter with NPCs or character progression.\n\n-there should be more player classes. No monk, barbarian, sorceror, bard..etc.\n\n*Updated Cons/Pros?*\n\n-there doesnt appear to be any type of crafting system that I have seen so far. The loot in the game seems to be randomly generated. However, as you progress through the campaign...progressively more powerful equipment is dropped throughout the game. This would seem to take the place of crafting, in a way.\n\n+/-alot of the spellcasting abilities that wizards had in D&D has been shifted to scrolls that you pick up and/or buy from merchants. An example would be "Cone of Cold". The Wizard doesnt have this by default on the talent trees. It is a scroll. I never use them, but they are powerful.\n\n++the game contains a blacksmith that "reforges" items from broken pieces that you pick up so make sure to look everything. I actually really like this feature. The weapons are actually really good.\n\nThat is about all that I can think of. I like the game and I think it people give it a chance then it will win them over. I would advice against getting so worked up over a "non-traditional" take on the D&D universe. There is only one game that truly made an effort to go "by-the-book" and that was "Temple of Elemental Evil". Go buy that one if that is what your looking for.","October 20, 2015","true","31.6"," 122 of 201 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","122","201","4","8"

Not sure why this game has so bad review ratio, there are some seriously bad games out there with better reviews. It's not a bad game, not by a long shot.\n\nSo, I looked at the negative reviews and seems some (or even most of them) seem to be judging the game by what it SHOULD have been instead of what it is. I did not follow the development of the game nor am I a DnD veteran so I can't say whether the hate is justified or not. I will review the game as it is and how I experienced it so far.\n\nThe good\n+ The story starts off right off the bat and is relatively interesting.

I can appreciate the ease of starting the game but as I keep advancing it feels a little restricting. For example, the tactics for your party members can not be altered manually so in order to control them more specifically, I have to constantly pause the game.","December 19, 2015","true","5.4"," 46 of 68 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","46","68","3","1"

If you want a D&D simulator, but The Temple of Elemental Evil. If you want something close to a D&D simulator that still lets you make modules and play with friends, buy the original Neverwinter Nights.\n\n\nShould you buy Sword Coast Legends if you want to DM online campaigns of D&D for your friends?\nNo, the DM mode is an absolute farce of a randomly-generated dungeon crawl where you can't even assign specific items. It's a random dungeon crawl where you can slap some aesthetic customization on the monsters, that's it.\n\nShould you buy Sword Coast Legends if you want a D&D Rules-Heavy Rulebook-Faithful game?\nNo. The game system in SCL is "based on" Dungeons & Dragons rules in the same way that D&D is "based on" the works of J.R.R. Tolkein.\n\nShould you buy Sword Coast Legends if you want a good Action RPG like Diablo?\nNo. As an ARPG, Sword Coast Legends is very subpar, meh-tier, missing several vital quality-of-life improvements that ARPGs like Diablo and Torchlight have developed through over a decade of development. Buy Torchlight II or Diablo III.\n\nSo, why should I buy Sword Coast Legends?\nOne: A friend has already bought it and wants to share the misery, and you have the purchase price to spend that you won't later regret not having for something else.\nTwo: If and ONLY IF you want a "Decent" tier D&D module set in a fairly good representation of the Sword Coast portion of the Forgotten Realms, with full voice acting of admittedly good quality, and are willing to grit your teeth and bull your way through barely-recognizably-based-on-familiar-rules skill trees and lackluster, weightless-feeling combat.\n\nSo, Pros:\n1: It's a game you CAN play co-op with friends.\n2: Good voice acting.\n3: Good scenery and attention to setting lore.\n\nCons:\n1: Only remotely based on D&D rules. Just enough to leave someone who actually loves D&D furious.\n2: DM mode is absolute crap and does not deliver on any of its promises.\n3: Gameplay is that of an Action RPG with very, very subpar mechanics.","October 24, 2015","false","15.3"," 66 of 103 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","66","103","0","0"

I am pretty disappointed in it and would not recommend buying it for most people.  What follows is a brief rundown of my complaints.\n\n1.  It claims to be based off of 5th edition DnD.  In reality it is much more like a simplified form of 4th edition DnD with a few minor inclusions from the new edition (mostly things with minimal mechanical effect).  You have skill trees for each class (also no multiclassing, and limited class selection).  What this means for those of you unfamiliar is that you have much more limited customization options.  You have "Daily" "Encounter" and "At Will" abilities separated by their cooldowns and very little in the way of meaningful customization options.\n\n2.  It plays sort of like a mix between an old MMO and Diablo but with more clunkyness and less meaninful customization.\n\n3.  The graphics take lots of processing power but don't look good, they are not stylized and abstract enough, or wowing and realiistic enough to work.  They seem really meh for how much processing they take.\n\n4.  I can't find a way to just save/reload.  For some games this can be a great feature (forcing you to look and think carefully before acting and rasing the stakes), but a lot of the quests in this one are counter intuitive or poorly explained and you can permanently mess them up by doing things that  seem perfectly reasonable.  A save/reload feature would at least make these instances less annoying and frustrating.\n\n5.  Final pet peeve.  I made a wizard as is my custom in these type of games.  First off wizard damage is kind of meh compared to other classes (which i don't really mind, I prefer battlefield control, but I like to choose it rather than be forced into it by the lack of good options to do anything else).  Second and MOST important you get a few wizard companions over the course of the game, they have the same basic skill selections as you in addition to having ADDITIONAL ones to make them special.  This means the NPCs are are essentially upgraded versions of the character you are allowed to make, this just really really rubs me the wrong way.","October 25, 2015","false","8.6"," 86 of 138 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","86","138","0","4"

Imagine you have all the elements of D&D; players, DM, maps etc. Then put the most useless quest building system in, make NPC's completely static and incapable of even the most basic quest trees... Oh, did I mention the ridiculously limited maps, or monster selections? Well, you get them!\n\nIf only I had adressed the worst elements. But no, it gets SO much worse. Having been a DM for 20+ years, I was positively drooling when I read about all the things that were promised. I am a storyteller, a master of my craft. After loading this game... I was stunned at how little the DM actually controls ANYTHING. Oh, I can drop monsters on the PC's all day long. That's not a problem. But I'm not trusted with even the most basic treasure tables, and I get to place a very limited number of chests in each area, the contents of which are completely random.\n\nSo how about my NPC's? How about I make a cool drow warrior for the PC's for the final battle? Oops. I don't even have access to the basic drow accoutrements a warrior would get (piwafwi, hand crossbow, drow armor etc) And magic items? Magic ANYTHING? Nope. Screw the DM, basically. You can customize some spells/powers. That's all. Oh, and the hundreds of spells that exist in the D&D universe? Yeah, no, you don't get those either.\n\nNow for the final insult, because a broken quest system, flat, unprogrammable NPC's and severely limited maps just don't insult you quite the right way. And I had hoped the DM had been kicked enough... but no-\n\nD&D has HUNDREDS upon HUNDREDS of monsters. From the basic Monster Manual of whichever Edition you happen to be using, there are also plenty of expansions with HUNDREDS more. You get about 8 'set types'. A goblinoid set, a sewer set, a VERY basic undead set, a drow set. There are clearly more monsters on the way, with the good creators of this game ready to nickel and dime you for each and every one.\n\nAs a 20+ year veteran of D&D, I cannot tell you clearly enough what a terrible disappointment this game was, for me as a DM, for my friends that, like myself, looked forward for months to finally live that incredible dream: to play D&D the old school way, but as a video game.\n\nThis game just plain sucks. Why, you might be wondering, have I wiaited so long to write this short and disappointing review? I was waiting, trying to give the creators time to fix even a fraction of this video abortion. I have waited long enough. Only buy this game if you have never actually played tabletop, or if you just enjoyed Baldur's Gate or any of the Black Isle games, this is fine for you. Just don't expect what they promised. They lied. Or they never knew what they were promising in the first place. I am guessing the former, as they haven't even hooked up those demons they've been promising for months now.\n\nI will never again believe the hype again about something I love so much.","March 3","false","33.7"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","25","32","0","0"

The D&D license holds a lot of weight.\n\nI might actually be cynical.\n\nI played this game.  And all it did was remind me that I want to play Neverwinter Nights.  So now I'm playing that.  I mean, it's not an enitrely awful game.  But with all the offerings out there and the fact that you can buy NWN on GoG for cheap I'd say your money is better used elsewhere.  I'll probably get around to beating the campaign at some point.  Probably.\n\n--------------------\n\nWhether I would recommend this game or not depends on a few things.\n\nAre you a fan of 3.5 or 5e rules?  If either or both don't expect them here.  Not even in the morphed form of games like NWN.\n\nWere you hoping for story and character development?  Move along.  This game is on par with a middle of the road tabletop game in terms of quality.  It's trope ridden and badly VAed.\n\nBaldur's Gate, Torment, or NWN this game is not.  If you're hoping for one of those experiences you won't get it.\n-------------------\n\nWhat it IS is an ok, emphasis on the meh, D&D flavored (in terms of atmosphere, setting, etc) game.  The setting is forgotten realms.  If you like that setting you might like this.  I never really have... I think it's one of the least interesting game settings there is.  Games that I love in the setting succeed in spite of it, not because of it.  The gods are flat and boring, the world is also flat and boring, and there's that schlocky "Oh, you're an adventurer" feel to it all as if adventurer was a real job.\n\nThe combat system is a butchering of 5e, and if you HATED the move to cooldowns (daily/encounter) in 4e you will despise this.  It's WoW style hotkey based dungeon running with a worse camera and no mana.\n\nBut it functions.  And it's not a competitive game so balance isn't QUITE so important as in other games.  There isn't PvP to speak of.  They have kind of limited talent trees, and some are nigh useless.  But they work ok, and you can make someone who throws fireballs or disables enemies, a few types of fighters, the trap springer, etc.  Just don't expect to be too different from the rogue or wizard next to you in multiplayer.  There are only a few useful builds per class.\n\nIt's not bad.  But it's not particularly good either.  Both from the RPers perspective and the munchkins perspective I'd say it's 6/10.","November 21, 2015","false","25.4"," 43 of 65 people (66%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","66","43","65","4","0"

I really don't like the skill trees and cooldowns at all. The skill trees fell very poorly implemented especially for casters. Taking points in the same ability such as charge 1, charge 2, charge 3, etc. is extremely dull and certainly does not feel remotely like a D&D level advancement system. Overall this game just does not feel like D&D and does not capture the magic older D&D games like older games like BG, BG2, and NWN did so well. The toolset is extremely limited . The monster scaling is absurd. It's one thing to spawn monters appropriate to the party level but that is not what this game does. It will literally scale a powerful enemy like a beholder down so that a group of level ones can defeat it. When playing multiplayer there is no penalty to death. You can literally just respawn over and over until you defeat an enemy.\n\nedit: Want to add that I played for several hours in the pre-release headstart that does not show up on in steam","October 20, 2015","false","0.4"," 95 of 158 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","95","158","2","0"

I recently picked it up for 9 dollars so my friend and I could play together.\n\nIt turns out I had made a serious mistake.\n\nThe game itself has received decent reviews from critics but overwhelmingly negative reviews on medias like steam.  They seem to all stem from the same place; expecting this game to essentially be a 5th edition equivalent baulder's gate or neverwinter nights.  It did seem prior to release that it was being branded in a way that suggested that.  Although that is not the case, this is still a good game.  A good Dungeons and Dragons themed game.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThe game itself plays with controls that anyone who has played either neverwinter nights or similar titles will be familiar with.  The rules are adapted from dnd 5th edition and are not identical.  Things like AC work almost exactly but are displayed a little differently. The biggest difference is leveling and abilities.  Leveling still occurs when a set exp is reached.  You then get the occasional attribute point (I.E. Str, Sta, Int) and also receive a set number of skill points.  The skill points are used to unlock abilities from various skill trees to customize your characters skills, spells, and play style.  Just like other rpg's that use skill trees. It works well.\n\n\nDND THEMED\n\nThe game is not an exact copy/paste of dnd rules.  It is however still in the forgotten realms world even if all of the skills and abilities do not behave identically to the rule books.  It is still very well done and a bunch of fun to play with.\n\n\nTHE VERDICT\n\nThis game is fun but not perfect.  Most games are not perfect.  I have enjoyed playing this game with my friends a great deal and the storyline and characters are definitely not bad.  The unfortunate truth is a ton of people expected this game to be something it wasnt and, despite being a good game in and of itself, could not look beyond their own preconceptions.  It is simply a shame a large group of petty peoples negative reviews bombed not only the game but the dev studio to death over something like that.

The developers promised too much and now that the full client is released the delivery is less then what the promises were. The game had been delayed and it seemed back a month ago that the developers were going to change things for the better with this delay. Now that the full client is here I have to ask what actually changed. I cannot tell the difference. The delay was a smokescreen. I have had my hopes slowly eroded when noticing there are no new monsters, no new balance changes that are desperately needed where half the classes are useless to play, and the same problems of monster scaling.\n\nThe balance issues become glaring when playing any class that does not have bonus attacks but must rely on cooldown abilities instead of auto attack hack and slash.  You want to play a wizard? Go ahead and cast that spell with a 200 second cooldown that does not even do ½ the damage of a creature but closer to 1/8. In the meantime the casting animation time spent would have been better auto attacking and even better auto attacking as a fighter.\n\nThe same problem of stacking stats and effects continues to make the fighter the best damage dealing class by 100’s of percentages. The difference between this class and all others is so vast for anyone who crunches numbers there is no reason to play another class. This problem is more glaring because of the monster scaling.\n\nThen we have the DM mode that has the same monsters available to place that it did months ago. You have 3 quest options. You cannot place items flush against walls like a bookcase etc. You cannot add items. All items are random roll ala diablo 3. All of the above leave me wanting for the NWN series that let me build robust worlds and in that vein Sword Coast Legends earns itself right now a not recommended. 5/10","October 20, 2015","false","4.9"," 77 of 127 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","77","127","2","0"

It fills me with the same feelings of adventure and grand storytelling that I had when playing the Baldur's Gate's and Neverwinter Nights as a kid/awry teen. The gameplay kind of feels like a mix between those two games I mentioned and also BG Dark Alliance and Diablo - if that makes sense.\n\nNow as far as the combat goes, I really don’t know where some of these negative reviews are coming from. Bump the difficulty up to hard and believe me – it’s INTENSE. I am constantly pausing my game, figuring out if I have a potion or scroll that will help me with the battle, repositioning my troops, and hoping to high Helm that the enemy doesn’t reach my back line.  In my opinion, the combat is very similar to style of Baldur’s Gate (more so than Neverwinter Nights) and that is not a bad thing at all.\n\nFurthermore, while I am a HUGE Forgotten Realms fan, I was never a desktop player. So frankly, I enjoy the simplicity of cooldowns and skill trees (call me crazy, but I actually kinda like not having to camp out overnight or resting after every engagement). If they literally translated everything from the desktop game, it would be a mess. So again, I think it’s right on for this kind of game.\n\nWhile I have not dabbled into the multiplayer much, I can tell you the story mode is superb. Now, I LOVE the Forgotten Realms, and I can see how it would be difficult getting sucked in if you’re not a fan. However, I believe this game was designed as homage to Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights, and I imagine many Realms/DnD fans are playing it. They have such a keen knowledge of Realms lore  and really put it to use in the story mode. Also, graphics are really nice (they won't blow you away, but I am certainly diggin' it). Oh and before I forget, I have actually read several reviews of people complaining about the voice acting – REALLY? You think THIS is bad? It seems great to me. The dwarves sound exactly what you would think a dwarf would sound like, Bellamy sounds exactly what I would expect a halfling to sound like. It’s seriously some of the best voice acting I’ve heard in a long time.\n\nAnd one more thing: Helm, God of Guardians, and the BEST God in the Realms is BACK and I couldn’t be more thrilled. Realms fans know, the D&D fourth edition killed off so many things we loved about the Realms, and now everything seems is back to where it should be. So after WoTC massacred my favorite god and then brought him back, n-Space promptly threw him back into the forefront with this game where belongs as one of the most iconic figures in the Realms – and I can’t get enough. Though, naturally, I would prefer to see his followers behaving a little more humanitarian-like – but that’s the beauty of Helm, he's not one-dimensional like some of the other goodly/paladin gods out there (*cough Torm, *cough Tyr) and can also be used by antiheroes and torn, complicated villains. So, again, thanks for making great use of the lore and making fans like me very satisfied.\n\nSo basically, if you like the Forgotten Realms, grand storytelling, fun game play, great graphics, and partaking in an epic adventure - you will love this game. Man, I just find it gripping, and as I continue to delve deeper into the story, my appetite to find out what’s going on only grows more and more. Please keep the sequels and official campaigns coming and watch your head as I throw my money at you!","October 28, 2015","true","51.9"," 58 of 95 people (61%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","61","58","95","6","0"

So far I can say that - for me - the game delivers on that end. I did not expect this to be the next Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter Nights or a 100% adaption of D&D rules. I feel that a lot of people expected such things and were disappointed.\n\nSome of the parts that I like:\n- Promising elements of the story (gods, prophetic nightmares, characters with their own agendas and personal quests)\n- Personally I like the characters that I have met so far\n- The graphics are nice enough\n- Battles are fun, not as tactical as the likes of Divinity Original Sin, Path of Exile or Dragon Age Origins but also not too simplistic. You have an array of abilities to use mixed with potions, spell scrolls and similar items to aid you in tight situations\n- Each character class has multiple skill trees to choose from. As an example: The ranger can be a dual-wielding or bow shooting fighter (which already offers multiple skill trees to choose from for each style), but he also has access to druidic magic which makes up (if I recall correctly) three other talent trees - offensive magic, buffs/defense and summoning.\n- The voice-acting is actually decent. The dwarf is gruff, the halfling ... halfling-y? Well in any way: I've heard much worse voice acting and this one definitely helps me to immerse in the story and the world\n- Forgotten Realms! :)\n\nSo far, so good. It is clear that this game is not triple-A style polished (animations, sounds, presentation) but in all seriousness? Recent triple-A releases have more than one time been disasters (Batman Arkham Knight, AC Unity... ) and I have to say so far from a technical perspective Sword Coast legends hasn't caused any problems on my system.\n\nIf you are willing to overlook the fact that this is not a truthful adaptation of the latest D&D rules (or don't care about it, which I personally don't) and would like to have some adventures on the legendary Sword Coast, this might be the game for you!\n\nAnd as much as I'm sick of games with "potential" (there have been too many Early Access titles that had "potential" and came up short), this one has a lot of potential to be expanded with races, classes and much more. Sure, some might argue these things should have been there on release date. Where are Tieflings, Druids, Monks? I guess this boils down to budget restraints. And honestly I'd rather they implemented a few races and classes properly (which as far as I can tell they did) than half-♥♥♥♥♥ a truckload of things.","October 26, 2015","true","7.9"," 70 of 117 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","70","117","0","0"

Unfortunately, this one does not live up to its name. The game itself isn't horrible and offers some entertainment value, however the story is bland and the game itself is grind-heavy. Although SCL does remind me of the older titles, there are a few major flaws and differences.\n\n1. Bugs. Everywhere. Seriously. Disappearing mouse, 100% GPU usage on a high end system, lack of optimization, choppy gameplay, clunky pathing, disappearing NPC's, etc...\n\n2. Odd hybrid 5th edition rules with cooldowns? The system does not appear to be true full-fledged 5th edition, and several of the dice rolls & mechanics behind your actions are hidden.\n\n3. Graphics. The game is not ugly, but it is also not beautiful. My concern with this game is that other, graphically similar games run smoothly with low hardware requirements, however this game runs pretty bad even on high end rigs. Also, something seems off with how it handles both AF and Shadows when it comes to GPU usage % and video memory. I have seen plenty talk on the forums about people getting massive framerate hits for no apparent reason, which I have experienced personally.\n\n4. Price. In it's current form, I would be more forgiving were it in beta. SCL does not feel complete. $39.99 USD for a buggy, incomplete game is no good.\n\nI would describe Sword Coast Legends to be more of a clunky cooldown-based Diablo clone. It is not well polished both graphically and in gameplay, thus I cannot give it a positive recommendation at this time. I would avoid this title until the above issues are fixed, or the price drops significantly.

I did not play the single player side of the game and did not mess with the editor for long and I will explain why...\n\nPrimarily I purchased this game because I was hopeful they would release an updated and streamlined Neverwinter Nights. I loved the idea of a game designed around an open DM tool using the DnD (5.0) ruleset as was advertised. If this is what you are looking for your time and money is better spent somewhere else.\n\nThis game is only DnD by setting and setting alone. Several classes such as Monk, Druid, Warlock and Sorcerer, almost all of which have been core to DnD since 3rd edition and older are gone. Several races such as Half-Orc, Gnome, and Tiefling are not among the playable options.\n\nThe classes are nothing like DnD, so the concept that this is DnD or 5th edition at all is baffling since the game is built on an ability system which feels like Diablo more than anything else. If you are a Diablo or Torchlight fan, you might give a shrug of casual enjoyment at the gameplay.\n\nWizards have lost several of their schools and historically famous spells to be replaced with new ones such as "Frost" and "Flame" along with others. Honestly, the game itself is unrecognizable as being related to 5th edition at all.\n\nThe biggest and most distressing flaws come from my most anticipated feature, the DM tool. At the very least I figured I could make my own setting, some maps, characters, and whatever else I needed. However, the tools basically allow you to take their pre-made areas, restricted to the region of sword coast (since the map itself is locked) and decorate them with set-dressings. Monsters can't be given classes, only class related abilities in a strangely hodge-podge 'pick your combo' fashion.\n\nAs a fan of pen and paper roleplaying and a lifelong DM, I came to play Sword Coast because I wanted to find a game that emulated that form of experience and gameplay and I have never seen a game so clearly miss its mark, while advertising itself as a full "Dungeons and Dragons" experience. If you are a DnD fan this game isn’t for you. If you want to beat up some DnD themed monsters in the setting of sword coast with a few friends, this might tide you over for a while but I don’t think it will be worth much else.\n","October 21, 2015","false","1.0"," 94 of 161 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","94","161","2","1"

After 1h of playing, I am not looking forward to playing again... Actually I am trying to convince my self that I should keep trying to enjoy it, which is a pretty bad feeling for a game you just started playing.\n\nControls:\nThe camera motion using the scroll is pretty bad for me. Using the righclick to rotate is ok, but I would love to swap the right click with the scroll. Can I do it? Did not find it anywhere.\n\nHaving to all the time doubleclick the char is pretty annoying.\nThe montion and constrols just feel akward. Never had this issue with Baulders Gate, NWN, etc, but I assume I will get used to the motion after a coulpe of days playing\n\nAudio / dialogues:\nThe charcter talking every single time I click is rather annoying, I found myself taking the sound away\nBut the character won't talk in a conversation?\nWas it really necessary to have a "mini loading" every time you start a conversation with a NPC?\nI am the kind of player who reads all the conversarions and explore all the options. Was I the only one who felt the dialogues were rather simple and childish?\n\nGraphic/Animation:\nThis is where I was let down the most... Dragon Age 3 is much older and the graphic and animations are SO much better, its not even in the same ballpark. This was a HUGE let down for me.\nCombat animations are bad\nObject interactions are really weak too\n\nCombat:\nSo, its actually a MMO combat system? Cooldowns? really? No Mana, no use/rest, no nothing? Just cooldowns?\nAlso the combat is so fast, that is very hard to make any strategic fight without having to pause every single time an ability is used. I feel like I am playing in fast foward mode all the time.\nI knew it wouldn't be turn based (which was already bad), but that fast? Really? Also, why can't I queu abilities?\nWhy do I need to click-target a lot of abilities?. I have my target selected already, why can't I just use the skill? This make me need to pause everytime I want to use such abilities, because otherwise I need to click moving foes, which is pretty annoying.\nThe combat system is just bad.\n\nItems:\nWhat is going on with so many different usable combat itens dropping so soon in the game? I got like 10 combat usable itens in the first hour of play, imagine in later levels, is going to be insane.\nAlso really? Magic item in the 1st vendor of the game? Why? D&D 5.0 was all about low magic items.\n\nAbilities:\nEventho is very differnt from D&D 5.0 I actually enjoyed the trees. I really hope I can reset later on, coz is hard to plan a char so soon in the playing experience.\nBut the mechanics, effects, etc, are really bad explained imo.\n\nCharacter Creation:\nI was unable to find the explanation for the backgrounds. I really didn't mind, since I play d&d 5 and know every single one of em. For new players is rather annoying. Specially not knowing what you get from BGs.\nIs it impossible to unlearn an ability after you click learn in the char creation? I was testing, and had to re-create my char, coz I selected an abilitie I would not like to have.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nSo far this game is a huge disappointment to me. I was expecting it to be the game of the year. The game I would drop everything else to play just it. Right now I can't find my self wanting to play again.\n","October 20, 2015","false","1.8"," 61 of 102 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","61","102","4","0"

There is a lot to love here, but there are also some utterly embarrassing failings, so read on for a sense of what is wrong here, so you can work out if the game's right or wrong for you....\n\nMany of the game's failings come out when you play with the mission editor, so lets focus on this first. When you play with the editor, you will discover:\n\n* There is no opportunity for branching dialogue or genuine decision making. The developer has put some simple decisions into the scripted campaign, but it isn't in the editor.\n\n* The developers seemed to think that the placement of items in the world is entirely cosmetic - many items can simply be run or fired straight through (such as those four meter high, meter thick stone pillars - they look very solid, but aren't!) as if tactics - meaning how the characters move, where they stand, etc. - were unimportant in a game like this! The developers are keen for players to focus on how skills are deployed - but not how characters are deployed.\n\n* There are no AI options, nor patrol paths, nor tactically interesting features to be added - the AI is moronic, and it is impossible to set up defensible positions for the PCs to assault (first, because it is impossible to set areas that can be fired over but not moved through, and second because the AI is so simplistic). If that sounds like I'm asking for a lot, keep in mind that those were the basis of my mission building way back in the days of Tenchu 2; when one user suggested fireable-through barriers (in a conversation on the game's forum) the community manager responded enthusiastically that that sounded like a really good idea, as if he had never heard it before. Sorry, but if the basic ability to set tactical challenges - which was around on a console game 15 years ago - sounds like a new idea to a modern PC developer, that's just embarrassing.\n\n* There is no ability to end or trigger quests by killing characters, no ability to open/close quests or provide rewards or challenges based on skills known nor character alignment etc., no ability to remove characters from scenes nor change friendly/hostile designations based on characters' actions.... Further, environmental interactions are suspended during combat, thus removing the possibility of encounters which mix combat with other activities.\n\nA really flexible mission builder would allow me to say "OK, so I'll set a challenge for the players... I might let them solve it through conversation, via a conversation tree... I might let them solve it by employing an in-character skill... I might let them solve it by stealth... I might let them solve it by tactical combat... I might let them solve it through full-frontal combat... or I might build the mission so that there are several ways through, and let the players choose." But here? Nope. No choice for the players, nor for the mission builder - it's full-frontal combat or nothing.\n\nBasically, it's all about the fighting - and the fighting is all about stacking and ordering powerups, watching cool-down times, etc.\n\nOther issues that don't come out in the mission editor:\n\n* When the first thing you read in the game description is that the game is "Set in the lush and vibrant world of the Forgotten Realms" you should expect bland, boring fantasy. If setting a game in the most middle-of-the-road stock fantasy setting imaginable is a plus point, then you know these guys aren't going to be pushing for any sort of real innovation in the story, setting or gameplay.\n\n* A lot of people have complained bitterly that this game is an adaptation of, not an implementation of, the D&D rules.  Personally I'm not bothered, but YMMV.\n\nNow... having said that...\n\nI got this game at the start of a free weekend. I spent every waking hour playing it for two days, and then bought it. So, there must be some great stuff here - because I was hooked, despite the utterly dreadful caveats above. So, here is some good stuff:\n\n* Single player with NPCs works really well, and I loved the ability to toggle time on and off (reminded me of the classic Baldurs Gate and sequels from the '90s). Basically, this core mechanic - giving orders to a party in real-time-with-pauses - works really well.\n\n* The "live DM" feature is interesting. I wouldn't use it, but hey, it's great to see developers trying something new, whether or not I personally like the idea.\n\n* The setting is bland, but the campaign has a nice feel to it - as stock fantasy goes, this is pretty good!\n\n* The mission editor may be embarrassingly limited, but it's also really, really easy to get into. Seriously, top marks for accessibility. (The only not completely accessible aspect of the whole game is that the tutorial is in the story, so online I've encountered a lot of people who have no idea what they're doing because they couldn't find a tutorial. Fix that problem, and you've got an amazingly easy-to-get-into game, both for players and would-be-mission-editors.)\n\n* The skill trees are fun and characters seem to develop very differently - there is plenty to explore in the character builds.\n\n* What I call "bland" may just be what people want. Maybe people don't want tactical combat, narrative decision making, or unusual fantasy worlds; maybe they just want dungeon-crawls that let them pummel well-known enemy types. (I got that realization last night: I had built a module which, as far as the mission editor's limitations would permit, was stealth/puzzle based; I played it over and over with different groups of players - one set loved it and really got into it; one set decided to bulldoze through the mission in a way I hadn't anticipated, and it was wonderful watching their skill in action; but every single other group got confused and bored, and so abandoned, usually with a note in chat that they were going to go find a dungeon bash.)\n\nSo, what it does it does very well. Personally I would like it to do a lot more - but I may be unusually demanding, and it will depend on the individual player whether or not the limitations above are actually critical.","December 21, 2015","true","210.7"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","25","37","3","0"

At the time of this writing, game is still in the making. Dev team is small but it looks like you can expect 2-3 major updates (community packs) and/or DLCs per year for near future. So, once again Steam does bad job keeping reviews up to date, discarding them would be a safe thing to do ... including this one I guess :)\n\n2. Whatever your image for ideal D&D game, SCL is not it. Just get over it, and you will be able to enjoy SCL for what it is. Game is strongly inspired by D&D 5th edition in its contents (monsters, spells & abilities, races, classes, etc.), but its mechanics are very different from what you'd expect from playing paper D&D or other D&D video games.\n\n3. Single player campaign can become rather simple even on highest difficulty level. If you start stacking buffs with good synergy, your party will become impenetrable sometime around level 7-8. So, feel free to experiment with builds which appear to be more fun/cool rather than efficient.\n\nKeeping above in mind, game is rather good. Few things stand out. Voice acting is amazing, bosses are pretty damn impressive, map tile sets are very well worked on. Other aspects of the game more on average side and/or of expected quaility, with few bugs & annoying things here and there.\n\nSCL will probably not become anyone's favorite D&D video game, given amount of resourses available to the devs, but it's definitely worth your time & money.","February 5","true","81.0"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","13","16","2","0"

Remember how you got introduced NPC's and got to know and love them? Well, forget about it. SW:L forces entire groups of 3-4 squadmates on you, with no background to them. Quest spawn randomly, as if developers had some sort of poorly written "guide to making an RPG" somewhere around, which states every other NPC should have lost something in the nearby woods. All that, while you are, like many times before, under atack by "unknown forces" with little hint on whats going on. Why cant an RPG actually make sense once in a while and have a logical conflict, instead of mysterious end-of-days prophecies forced on unwilling and unaware PC? Probably b/c game doest have much to offer in terms of lore and has to cover up by adding "mystery".\n\nNow my critisism above stems from single-player and I noticed other users praise game for multiplayer and DM possibilities it presents. While I havent tried it yet I cannot quite understand what this is all about, since couple of better games in the past offered that kind of experience, namely both parts of neverwinter nights seems like a much better adaptation of D&D rules.\n\nStack a terrible graphics and annoying voice acting on top of that (I got instantly bothered with my character responding with a line to every click i make) and you end up with a game that is definitely hard to reccomend even if it didnt come at such a high price.\n\nPros:\n- D&D 5 ed rules (though overshadowed by terrible adaptaion)\n- FR setting brings a hint of nostalgia\n- Lenthy campaign (although given the quality - might be more of a con, really)\n- Difficult (On higher setting the game requires to actually switch between group members and use abilities to win most battles)\n- Multiplayer options offer semi-unique experience\n\nCons:\n- Poor graphics\n- Annoying voice acting\n- Outdated UI\n- No roleplaing options\n- Poor lore\n- Poor dialogue\n- Main story feels like a mix of cliches from various other RPG's\n- Heavily overpriced (probably trying to take advantage of D&D fans)","October 19, 2015","false","1.1"," 135 of 242 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","135","242","5","12"

D&D rules are implemented exactly as in tabletop and no exceptions for the computer medium, you can pretty much ignore the negative reviews. This game is a blast to play and contains a great story and voice acting that makes for a high quality RP experience. The essence of 5th Ed. rules are there, mainly to make a better computer experience as most all computer D&D games have done. The biggest gripe has been the magic system, which underwent the most revision in order to eliminate the real issues with the Resting function in tabletop. Yet it's a fine system itself, and you quickly get used to it and learn its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nJust today the Rage of Demons DLC was released and that's the inspiration for my review. I've played through the game three times with different classes, and it's been a joy each time. It's a shame the hyperpurists drove the developer out of business, because this is a labor of love. I don't know if there's any real future for the game system now, but if so I'll buy whatever they put out.

I was also somehow fine with the whole skill-tree process too. I mean, I'd have loved to see again a game with actual FREEDOM such as the first Neverwinter Nights, which gave so much more in terms of creativity and fun. But I knew that this game was not going to be anything like that, and I still was fine.\n\nSo, why I am here to write down a negative review?\n\nI've been excited to play out the dm mode with my friends, but as soon as I got into it I found out with utter furstration that the DM "tools" are a joke.\n\nSome examples:\n○You can't create/edit an area. You can just pick a "preset" scenario and the game randomizes it (poorly?)  for you.\n○You can't edit items.\n○You can create/edit NPCs but you can't set their level, or give them items beside the basic ones. (Unless I've been blind.)\n○You can't create a custom monster, you can just edit the presets. Which are very few, compared to the usual Faerun variety of enemies.\n○You can't decide specific quest rewards, you can just pick the kind of item (Armor, Weapon or Trinket) and it'll be completely random.\n\nBasically, you can just tell the game to create an area for you, you get to place pre-made monsters, traps and props into it and see if the players can manage to survive.\nWhat turned me down the most, though, was to discover that this game has no mod support whatsoever.\n\n\ntl;dr\nGame is actually not bad, but there's a strong risk of it becoming repetitive and boring.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mnsuangel/recommended/325600/","mnsuangel","sieg_alexander","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mnsuangel/","55 products in account","IntroductionHi, this is the first review I've ever done for one of the over 50+ games I have on Steam in the years that I have used Steam! That's a big deal because... the only reason I'm reviewing, is because this game has so many negative reviews. So, in honor of the great time (in such a short time) that I have had with this game, I am going to take some time to explain why you should buy it, whether it's on sale or not. Also, I realize that the game I've played is very different from the game on release, but if that's the case, people should have changed their reviews by now to reflect that (aside from the people who just wanted a BG or NW follow-up or whatever, which we'll talk about).\n\nGraphicsA lot of the negative reviews used words along the lines of, "It's okay for a game that was made in 2015" or "this game looks horrible for 2015". I'm not sure what the obsession is with mentioning the release year. Maybe they think that that makes them more convincing. It does not. When compared to the other games in this genre that I have on my Steam list, Sword Coast Legends has the best graphics by far. That's not an opinion, that's a fact, and I would know because I'm a graphics wh- that is in love with AA, ENB, max resolution, etc. I also literally just got done playing PoE and I've played BG and Div. before, both of which are graphically inferior. It's just that simple.\n\nAudioI don't give much credence to the music of a game, but I recognize it's power. I still hum tracks from the original Final Fantasy Tactics (PS1) in my head. I also blast the Bloodborne soundtrack in my car sometimes. I don't think Sword Coast Legends' soundtrack rises to the amazing work of the composers in either of those two examples, but the music in this title, dare I say it, is rather inconsequential. It may have improved my experience had it been better/more present, but the way it is never hurt my enjoyment of the game, and therefore, I'm not really unhappy about it. Aside from music, the VOICE acting in SCL is some of the best voice acting I've heard in a while. Some of these games are just text. I realize that a lot of the older crowd grew up with text and zero voice acting in their games. I don't really give a flying f-. The voice acting vastly improves the game in my opinion. I didn't like all of the characters the same, but I connected with ALL of them because of it. It is amazing how much that can mean to immersion and to a player experiencing a game.\n\nGameplayI have to say, a lot of the games previously mentioned gave me some frustrating moments in gameplay, and not from battle difficulty, but interface, layout, etc. It was less so with either of the Div. games, but the others share their problems. I did not have any major problems with the gameplay in Sword Coast Legends. I do believe at times that the enemies are a bit too "spongey" and really don't need to be. A prime example is a standard skeleton you meet earlier on in the game. However, it's not really frustrating, and the only effect is extending the length of battles. It is possible I could be frustrated by that in time, but I doubt it, since my characters will continue to get stronger and acquire better gear. Another thing that may frustrate some individuals is the delay on moving an item off of the toolbar or ranging difficulty of quests (in the investigative/puzzle) department. The toolbar delay is to prevent players from accidentally pulling things off. Get over it. Investigation/puzzles are not my favorite part of the game, and sometimes when you don't know where to go it's odd that there isn't a modern map marker like a lot of RPGs have (sometimes you have to physically find it). I realize that's more realistic though, which is why I don't hold it against SCL, I'm merely saying I understand the criticism.\n\nThe general rule that I have is if it takes longer than five minutes of pausing, looking around, or reading, I probably should just "internet the answer" because any longer than  five minutes and you've already broken character/immersion anyway.\n\nStoryDoes it reinvent the wheel? No, the world is the world of D&D (well... one of them :D). The thing is that it doesn't need to have an original world or all of the races or all of the classes or all of the gear. It has a fairly unique story that the player is immediately drawn into. From the moment I started the game I was engrossed in that story and I can't say that about all of the games mentioned previously. In fact, for the beginning of PoE I literally didn't care. Most of the time I was saying, "okay... okay... okay," instead of excitedly saying, "oh my gosh this is the same place we saw earlier!" <- People who've played will understand this. The story was a good story, and a story I'd happily play again.\n\nThe campaign itself is fairly "linear", but I don't really like that word because it implies that there are not sidequests. There are a lot of sidequests to be done and some are better than others. My guess is that if people aren't completing most of the sidequests, they aren't getting a lot of the exp. they need for subsequent level-ups. That may address the too-spongey argument, but I'll have to wait until I hop back on. I may have completed every sidequest so far, which would make that moot. Whatever, it doesn't matter. The point is, that this game has a good story. I would even go so far as to say a great story.\n\nAccessibilityI don't think people would normally review the accessibility of a game, but I'm going to because that is another problem that I had with some of the games mentioned. A lot of people have also negatively compared the DM design system to another game. From what I can say, as "limited" as people have made SCL's DM system sound, they are again, being self-entitled about it. The DM system in this game provides a lot of options to create an adventure. It may not have given them ALL the options they wanted, but as I understand it, the devs have been working on that since Day One. At the time of writing this review, two free community packs have gone out. Don't get me wrong, I think that more and more game developers need to start doing this (and cutting bs DLC money grab tactics) but that was still very responsible of Sword Coast. It's one thing to make a game that hyped diehard fans are unhappy with and then say, "well, we're sorry to hear that." It's quite another to crank out changes and alterations to the game to suit the player's wants and needs. I say, bravo. In fact, it's accessible enough that I bought a second copy for my fiance'. That should say something.\n\nConclusionI am confounded by the amount of people that have given this game a negative review. I was so confounded that I waited to buy this game until it was on sale. That was a mistake. This game deserves more than that and it was clearly a work of love. It is clear to me now that a lot of the people that were hyped about this game thought it would be something it's not. That is the worst kind of self-entitlement. I took time to research what exactly the developers said before the release and the truth is that they didn't lie or misrepresent the game in any way. It is disappointing that so many people would hold that against them when it's just not true, but I digress. That is the world we live in.\n\nFinally, I apologize if this review was too long, but you have to understand, I saw the reviews and threw this game on the wishlist to buy on a rainyday. I am sad that I missed out on time I could have spent playing this game. I have only seen the surface of SCL so far and I have enjoyed every minute of it.\n\nEDIT: When discussing story, I covered the story that I have seen so far. I don't expect a ME3 ending so I'm pretty sure I will be pleased when I complete it. I will be updating my review at that point to reflect any changes.

Which is fine, not everything has to be.\n\nI think this game is going for a NeverwinterNights feel, which is probably the closest thing to compare it to. By that I mean it has a:\nDecent linear story line, with side quests to distract and reward you.\nA focus on user generated content for online play in order to give it longevity (there isn't a whole lot of amazing work at the time of this review, but the game hasn't been out that long)\n\nThe two biggest things I can say that people are claiming as a huge negative, I actually am okay with. Instead of limited per rest use spells, you get cooldowns, longer cooldowns for more powerful spells etc. This removes the need to stop and rest after every fight, which I am absolutely fine with. For tactical use and timing of spells, Pillars of Eternity has you covered. This allows you to focus on the dungeon delving and such.\n\nSo you won't get any dragon age or witcher levels of story and choice, but there are choices (usually to kill or not to kill certain people etc).\n\nOver all I am enjoying the game, and can't wait for more user made campaigns to crop up.","November 1, 2015","true","79.3"," 47 of 81 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","47","81","0","0"

This is the only reason I bought the game although I will most likely explore the other options later (DM mode, online, creation, etc.)\n\n...\n\nI'm only at level 3 with my party but I'm *totally* digging this game.\n\nBeing no stranger to cRPG's and RPG's in general (going back 25 years or more), I really can't understand the negative comments I've read regarding Sword Coast Legends other than persons being so obsessed with the play styles and designs of the RPG's they've obsessed on in the past that they simply can't suspend that obsession adequately or long enough to enjoy something that plays/feels/looks a bit different.\n\nI played all the Ultima games, all the Baldars games, the early Fallout games, the Bethesda games (Morrowind, Oblivion, etc.), all the Dragon Age games ... the latest and very fun games like Pillars of Eternity (which I really love) ... and I'm having just as much fun with Sword Coast as I have with any of those former games .. perhaps more, even as it's one of the first RPG's in a while that I've really become quickly immersed in ... even more than Pillars, which I've already said I love.  I find Pillars more focused on reading of text and perhaps a bit more fleshed out in that regard, more writing, more backstory and certainly much more political. But the pure isometric, non rotating desing of Pillars and the overall graphic solution wears on me at times.\n\nSword Coast on the other hand, though not as dense in the writing category is still developing in to a really fun and engaging single player story line with really nice graphics and fantastic use of well illustrated cut scenes. The voice acting is top notch and very believable (something that can make or break a game for me) ... the skill tree and level up process is just complex enough to not become so in depth as to become cumbersome and game-flow breaking while also offering a fine mix of what one could call traditional, class based attribute and abilities choices. The writing and backstory is again, just enough to carry things along in an interesting and provocative way while, like the attribute system, isn't so dense as to break the flow of the game. Personally, I don't have 14 hours a day to game (more like 2) and so games with incredibly dense reading requirements or incredibly complicated attribute/level-up systems, quickly get put on the shelf for a moment when I've more time to invest in the game.\n\nThe graphics in Sword Coast are great … the gameplay and combat system is fun and intuitive (think Dragon Age: Origins but much simplified in regards to any sort of “tactics system”): one can pause, plan, micro manage and individually delegate orders to each member of the party and overall, it comes out being very effective and hugely fun in my opinion.\n\nBut the one thing that always makes a difference in any isometric type game design is the ability to fully rotate the play field. Dragon Age Origins got this right and so does Sword Coast Legends. For me, someone who likes to closely examine each and every nuance of the playing area, this is essential and makes for a far more immersive experience when traversing any of the many game areas, whether within caverns or, especially, outdoor areas (which in Sword Coast, are sometimes quite spectacular). I also appreciate the fairly decent zoom levels, both in and out but would like to see some ability to increase these extents if possible.\n\nThe only real quibble I have is that one cannot adjust the vertical viewing angle. I'm okay with the “locked” viewing angle but being able to adjust this as effectively as one can rotate the screen would vastly increase my enjoyment of a game I'm already very much enjoying.\n\nSo if you made it through that entire essay and have found yourself relating to anything I've said then buy the game without hesitation. Set aside any fanatical obsessions you might have lingering about regarding past titles and enjoy a really very well put together RPG.\n\nNow mod scene … go to town on this ♥♥♥♥.","January 3","true","34.8"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnvondraugr/recommended/325600/","johnvondraugr","johndraugr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnvondraugr/","249 products in account","Personally, I like the game but there are some issues and also some facts.\n\nIn Short... Would I recommend this game to others? Yes and No. Yes, if you want to play a good cRPG solo/multiplay story mode. NO if you want a great editor suite or Dungeon Crawl mode.\n\nFact: I haven't played D&D 5th Edition, so the rules as they are implemented in SCL seem fine to me. Perhaps if I had played PnP 5th Ed, I'd feel more like those in their reviews who complained about how little this game follows or resembles D&D or D&D 5th Ed. To me, I'm not upset at this because again, I never played 5th Ed.\n\nPersonal Issues: These are some of the things I don't like either.\n\n1. Dungeon Crawling: Once you enter the dungeon you cannot return to the surface (Adventurers Camp) to buy/sell items. When playing a Dungeon Crawl (DC) I like to max out the size of the levels, as well as the depth of the dungeon. No way to return to camp to sell goods or get better goods makes the DC mode a little less enjoyable.\n\n2. Dungeon Crawling: You can't save your dungeon. See #1 above for how I like my DC dungeons. Well, when you have 10 levels of large dungeons, you certainly aren't going to play that all in a single session. Sadly, you cannot save your progress in DC mode. When you leave, you have to restart with a new randomized dungeon next time. :(\n\n3. Editor Related: Creature Sets: There are a bunch of pre-defined Creature Sets. Undead, Goblins, Beasts, etc... As a GM in the editor you can make your own customized Creature Sets. To me this could/should mean....\n\na. You can make a new set of creatures and then create completely new monsters from scratch.\n\nb. Be able to mix and match monsters from the various pre-built Creature Sets. Ex: A Skeleton from the Undead set, a Wolf from the Beast Set, a Goblin Archer from the Goblin Set, and a Wererat from the Sewer Set, etc...\n\nNONE of that is POSSIBLE! All you can do to make a so called "Custom Set" is to take any of the pre-built sets that come with the game and rename the set, change the colors, equipment load out and stats of the already existing creatures. You CAN NOT mix and match from multiple sets, You CAN NOT create new creatures from New models, etc... You cannot change the model of a creature to a different one. Ex: In the Goblin Set, change the Goblin Archer to a Dragon, or Ghoul model. This feature (Customizing Creature Sets) is 100% useless. Why would I want to take the Goblin Creature Set that comes with the game and simply re-color each goblin within the set and perhaps change their stats? Hmmm a Goblin with as much power and strength as a Dragon.... Uh NO! BORING!\n\n4. Editor Related: Area Sizes: In DC mode you can set each level of the dungeon to small, medium or large. In the Campaign Editor I see no such option. Every time I built a City or tried to, the area turns out to be extremely small. As in less than a typical street block in size. That is not cool.\n\n5. Game Play: Maybe it's me and I'm used to how other games do it, but to move your character to click on a section of the viewable area and the characters go there. A la Baldur's Gate. But... you then have to use the WASD keys to move the camera so that you have more area to click on to move your characters.\n\nThe Devs should have at least included an option to choose between the WASD mode and perhaps a mode similar to NWN1 where you simply move the cursor off the screen in one of the 4 directions and this simply moves the viewable area in that direction. That is alot easier. A possible third option would be to click on an effect such as "Follow the Character" so that the character is automatically always in the center of the screen and as you move in any direction, the actual area or map moves with you instead of forcing you the player to have to first, move your character, then use the WASD keys to move the screen.\n\nThere are a few more issues that I've come across but they aren't that big a deal. As for positives I will say this....\n\nI've played the single player campaign and so far I like it. The game is actually fun, but again if you are expecting 5th Edition D&D rules, you may not be happy. To me SCL is just another generic RPG rule set that seems to have some D&D features (spell names, effects, monster names, etc...) that are similar. Please remember I've NEVER played 5th Ed D&D so that could be a big reason I'm not bothered by the SCL rule set. Getting back to the game. The story so far is a typical fantasy story done probably a hundred times before, but still is fun here in SCL. I enjoy the solo campaign except for the camera controls as mentioned in #5 above.\n\nTo finalize my thoughts. If you like fantasy cRPGs and solo campaigns, then you might like SCL. Is it worth $40 or $60 (deluxe Ed)? Only if the DM mode and Editor mode is overhauled and made to have more features and to expand on current features that are completely basic, incomplete, or watered down to almost uselessness (See #3, 3a, 3b and 4 above).\n\nFor me personally, I'll ride out the game's solo story/campaign mode, then unless the DC mode is altered a bit, or the editor features are improved, I'll probably put the game away after the solo campaign.","October 20, 2015","false","1.0"," 36 of 61 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","36","61","0","0"

I have not tried the game since my initial experience and you should probably read a more recent post/review if you are planning on buying this game.\n\nAlso I had not earlier noticed the developer’s comments below even though the timestamp shows it was made shortly after this review was written. It bodes well for the game that the developers have the level of commitment needed to comment on individual customer’s feedback. I hope this game becomes all it can be.\n\n/DeAurion\n\nOriginal review:\nThis game leaves a lot to be desired, in particularly in Multiplayer which was what we intended to play. Let's start with the clunky interface.\n\nThis is a click-to-move-game but it has an unfortunate "pull to select" feature which has the devastating effect that when your character is moving, it is difficult to accurately get your character to respond to new move commands. The game is likely to interpret the new command as click-pull-to-select instead of move. In comparison other click-to-move-games – like Diablo 3 or any MOBA – are much more responsive. Also, the collision boxes of characters are exaggerated and makes your character move awkwardly in a party.\n\nMultiplayer is generally painful, in particular if you are not the leader as you will frequently lose control of your character (e.g. while swapping gear) when the leader or other party members interacts with the world. To make it worse a forcibly interrupted/aborted gear change will leave the item you were moving “stuck” to your cursor until go back into the menus and pick a new one up.\n\nEach character has a multitude of skills and stat points available to them, but – at least for the fighter and paladin we tried playing – they all are slow and unexciting, making you wonder if they really do anything at all. You press the button, nothing happens for a while, then you see the cool-down counter start. In addition the cool-down of said abilities are depressingly long. To wait 2 minutes for an ability when you have a total of 4 on your bar in leaves you staring on the screen for minutes at a time, waiting for a button to press while your little character swings dourly but impotently at the enemies.\n\nIn addition, the look of the game – at least the areas available to the “new player” – leaves you underwhelmed. It is not particularly ugly, just plain and mundane. This would not have been as bad had the action been quicker with a responsive interface. Now you are left with plenty of time while waiting for your rare CD or lumbering character to move, to stare at the unassuming doodads – all which are copy-pasted with reckless abandon all across a whole map section.\n\nFrom a technological perspective the game does not seem to support e.g. triple monitor resolutions. I was left at 1920x1080 or with a horribly stretched game that could not be navigated due to mouse position mismatches. In general the menu layout is also clunky. For example, to exit the game you must look under “options”.\n\nThis game is not finished, or at least not very polished. Perhaps some of the shortcomings can be mitigated by a clever Dungeon Master designing his own content to counter some of the unacceptably slow elements.\n\nThis felt like a return to the 90s and a Baldur’s gate copy with a slightly different twist. It does have the ability to build your own adventures, but you must have very loyal friends if they are to endure the actual game you made for them.\n\nIt would likely take a year to salvage this title, if the developers are interested in doing so. Until then, let the 90’s stay where it belongs – dead and gone – and go play something else.\n\n/DeAurion","October 31, 2015","false","3.2"," 46 of 80 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","46","80","0","3"

In this game whenever you level up every enemy does too. Thats not challenging thats frustrating. Sorry guys, I bought 4 copies of this game for me and friends and I have to give my first negative review ever on steam. If you guys remedy that problem I will change my review.

If you are hoping for that D&D game like Neverwinter Nights series and Baldur's Gate series then this game is not it. This game is a lot closer to Diablo than Dragon Age: Origin. Possibly more or less a top-down and cheaper cousin of Dragon Age 2 (without the cool actions/classes/voices/scences)\n\nGenerally, this game gives a feeling of hack&slash rather than that tactical/strategic planning of old school focus RPG. Most of the skills are extremely simple, action focused and feel more or less like watered down versions of the real D&D skills. The closest I could feel is that these are like MMORPG skills (lots of the skills but lots of redundant) but without much thinking and planning. There are almost no difference between classes if you focus on the same skills.\n\nThe UI is not a bad design but I can't seem to bring up the combat log as default. Then you combine this with the default 3-tab logs thing, you get a small window that almost seem irrelevant like in some MMO. You can't see the combat rolls or anything that usually show up on a D&D game.

After ten hours played I realized I was hooked, so here is my review.\n\nThe combat system is automatic, and the AI makes smart decisions in most situations.  However, when playing the solo player campaign, you can pause every battle by pressing the space bar, and micro manage every member of your group if you are a control freak.  Most battles are hack and slash, and I usually choose to let the AI determine most battles for me while I control one character primarily.  For those of you who like to compare Pillars of Eternity to this game, POE had the same system.\n\nThe multiplayer interface is very easy to use, and the in-game VOIP works well without any setup.  On my first multiplayer dungeon game I was glad I was able to talk to veteran players who gave me tips on how to setup the multiplayer options correctly.  What they showed me was that by using the dungeon creator, you can set the difficulty of the map, the type of creatures, the quests, the loot rewards, and then it procedurally generates the dungeon map.  If your into grinding the same dungeon over and over until your eyes bleed this is not the game for you.  Every time you run the dungeon it is different.  You set these options after you log in by clicking the bill board in the starting village.  After you create a game people automatically spawn within it at the starting camp.  Working together is the key, and staying close to your healer is very important, especially for boss fights.  My level one tank died alot, but his gear sucked so meh w/e.  After we completed the dungeon I had a couple armor upgrades, and a bunch of gold to spend.  This is a perfect reward system for new players who might be frustrated that they die alot due to having gear that is lower quality than other pugs who are way ahead of them.\n\nThe solo player campaign has a compelling and interesting story, and a lot of sub-plots that result in rewards if you complete them.  I felt like I really wanted to explore all the maps, and search for hidden quests and loot.  Sometimes you find random items that later on will cause new dialog choices when you talk to NPCs.  Your stats such as strength and charisma offer new dialog choices as well.  You can choose many different paths in the dialog that result in radically different outcomes.  This type of RP element is something I really liked about Dragonage, and POE.\n\nSword Coast Legends is for players who like fantasy themed RPG video games and MMOs that like to game in small groups, or solo.  The negative reviews I have read suggest players had expectations that were unrealistic to begin with.  This game is not for the AD&D purists who expect their table top game to be magically ported into a multiplayer video game.  The skill progression is in a traditional MMO format, and not in the AD&D style, which makes sense to me because it's a video game.  The DM tools are fluidic, and simple enough for the beginner to understand and use.  You can not create entirely new graphical skins of maps, or areas, or monsters, but the resources they give you let you do a lot, and I expect them to come out with more DM features over time.\n\nLike most things in life, you get out what you put in, and I intend on playing the hell out of this game!

Unfortunately, they instituted a magical device that allows for Party members not currently in your party to contribute in conversations as if they were actually there. You might consider this to be a great idea, but all it serves is to break immersion and decrease replayability of the main story.\n3: GM Features... The GM Features allow a great deal of expansion and will greatly enhance the overall replayability of the game.\n\nCons:\n1: Interface... The UI is clunky and counterintuitive. It is very similar to old style NWN games... but unfortunately it also shows that they did not learn from the mistakes of previous games. Rebindable keys do help, but not enough.\n2: Graphics... The graphics are sub-par for what you should expect from a $40 title. I don't expect AAA quality, obviously.. but the graphics SHOULD be better than what they are for a $40 price point.\n3: Lack of innovation... This game feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized conversion of NWN 2 and DA Origins.... and yet not capturing the charm or feel of either game.\n\nI do have a General Impressions video on my standard "Is it worth it?"

Good mix of quests, characters, story, good voice acting and strategy does contribute to the gameplay. It also retains a D&D feel throughout without being overly clunky.

It's been fun as far as it goes. Having said that it does need to develop and mature  with more tools, more customizable elements and smooth out some of the UI and creation elements.

I have not tried the DM mode so cannot speak for that, but the character creation is fairly basic, you distribute your attributes after picking class/race/gender/background and then you pick your skills. Rather than having uses restored per day or after rest all abilities have a cooldown. The game is point and click and once you have started an action your character is forced to finish it before it can do something else.\n\nLike all other rpg games, you get stronger both as you level up and as you find progressively better gear.  You play as a party of 4 with the potential for a player to be the DM to make 5. It does offer voice chat, which I feel was a nice touch, greatly improves coordination.\n\nI am only recommending this because I enjoyed the brief time I was able to play this game. I would likely not recommend if I had over 10 hours on it, because it seems that it would get stale rather quickly.","December 20, 2015","true","11.4"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","19","31","0","0"

In time the developers seemed to grudgingly admit to over selling that  portion of the game.\n\nAll I wanted was a Sword Coast game with modern graphics and a decent story that played similar to Neverwinter Nights. That is what I got and I have enjoyed growing my characters and playing them in an inreasingly tougher environment.\n\nSo if what you want is a solid game, get it.

The single player campaign is very good, but the quest system becomes very buggy in co-op. SCL's great strength is in the DM mode, where one of your friends acts as dungeon master and leads you and your friends through a custom story. So far, the game has launched with limited customization, but the developers are committed to adding new content and customization options (and so far they've been true to their word) so there is a lot of potential here. As the developers continue to expand the DM's capabilities, SCL will continue to fluorish as a co-op dungeon crawler, but you NEED a creative and dedicated DM and group of friends who enjoy RP. If the developers continue their work on improving the game, SCL will be one of the best D&D titles available.\n\nThe good:\n-Well written single player story\n-Dungeon Master mode\n-custome co-op dungeon crawling that feels like the good old pen & paper D&D days.\n\nThe bad:\n-The macintosh port is very buggy and slow.

I did not hate the game, by any means. It is a pretty game, with a lot of love put in the design, I can see that clearly. It just completely lacked any excitement. I felt terribly bored after playing for two days, and I can't justify spending $20 or more on it.\nWhat was a miss, in my opinion:\nThe fight system: it is very forgiving. I did not have to pose and assign tactics to each member of the team of 4. It was sufficient to manage the main character. The rest of the team ran on AI and it was quite a success. Also, the normal difficulty is very forgiving. On one occasion that my team was wiped except for the puny healer, I just kept the healer running away from the enemies shooting them with her bow, and eventually all the enemies were dead.\nThe loot: I didn't have to spend a moment contemplating what to sell and what to put on. The decision process was binary and oversimplified. So much irrelevant loot (weapons no characters can use, low quality etc). Talking about junk, there was also a lot of misc loot that I had no clue whether it was towards some purpose (crafting perhaps?).\nThe skills system: you know it is bad news when you open the leveling tree and instead of one tree it is half a dozen or more of trees. When you can practically respec your ranger into a mage or a thief or a warrior as you please, this is just wrong in my books.\nNothing above in itself is a reason to call the game terrible. As I said, it looks good, it runs easy, and I suppose it can help kill time. It just didn't have any excitement.

Don't believe me? Check their wikipedia page and see if you recognise playing any of their games prior to SCL. You often wonder why so many movie licensed games end up being so terrible.

If you are not the leader you will frequently lose controll of your character. Over a 2 hour session the game went unresponsive several times and the only solution was to restart, losing any progress. In addition, alot of the times an action to move your character will be interpreted as a select action which is very annoying. If above mentioned problems could be fixed and you are a person that likes to wait minutes for "cutscene" conversations this is the game for you! Also, if you want to click an enemy and wait for a minute before anything happens watching the sub-par graphics you will enjoy this game (the graphics remind me of baldurs gate only here the gameplay is far worse). Point beeing, there are close to no skill in this game and the delay makes it impossible to do anything constructive in a group. I cannot in any way recommend this game. Furhtermore, the overall quality is terrible and this is what I would expect from a free to play game, not a ~40euro game.

Neverwinter Nights was a staple in my childhood that defined my future gaming habits and also my love for creation and fantasy. I just got this game today, it is a great game with lots of potential but so far there have been numerous things I'm not happy with. As 80% of the reviews tell you, do not get this game if you're looking for a repeat of Neverwinter Nights because you will not find that here. I was an absolute fiend on the Neverwinter Nights toolset and was really hyped up about the DM mode - I'm not sure how it works yet but there's basically no creatures available in DM mode (and the fact that you have to pay extra for the Beholder - one of the most iconic footholds in the D&D franchise - is just plain pathetic). I'm wondering if you unlock creatures as you go through the story mode of the game, which is absolute hogwash for those who are more into the DM'ing side of D&D like I am. Don't get me wrong, I love playing through the single player campaigns and will play them time and time again countless times over to see everything I missed, but playing through the entire game just to add a Red Dragon into your module doesn't strike me as a good selling point and if I'd known that initially I doubt I would have bought this game.\n\nThe controls are also a little shoddy, and sometimes unresponsive, but that could be because my computer isn't a top-of-the-end machine and doesn't run the game perfectly.\n\nThe characters are just as engaging and real as they should feel and have felt in past games - I'm finding myself growing attached to them already after only a few hours of gameplay, so that's a good thing at least.\n\nThe graphics of the game are pretty good for the type of game it is - some of the creature models are a little unpleasing or awkward-looking, like they were made hastily, but I can look past that because of the extensive customization options for them in DM mode, including skin, hair, equipment colour changes and full control over their skills and attributes. The preset tiles are also useful and make area designing much less of a hassle than it was in Neverwinter Nights, while giving it a much more natural feel. The objects are nice but (shock horror) I have issues with their availability too. So, I'm left feeling disappointed by it overall.\n\nI paid full price for this game less than two hours ago and all of a sudden there's a deal on. Are you flipping kidding me? Don't suppose there's any way I could get that £10 back? Then I'd feel more like I'd pay what this game was actually worth.\n\nI'll probably go off and replay Neverwinter Nights and come back to this when more content is added or something so I can actually get my money's worth out of this. I'm one of those unfortunate people who doesn't make much money and I feel so horribly ripped off, I'm actually pretty angry. Neverwinter Nights provided me over a decade of gameplay for about £10 and now I've just spent £32 on a game I doubt I'll be playing very much.\n\nAlthough I have enjoyed what I've played, the cons are heavily outweighing the pros in this case. I'll keep an eye on the future content packs and see if the game improves as I understand it's still new. I'll keep playing through it as well, just because it is set in a world very close to my heart - but if it wasn't for how deeply rooted the world of Faerun is within me, I wouldn't be hanging around.","November 25, 2015","false","4.0"," 31 of 55 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","31","55","3","2"

I absolutely love this game.\nThe gameplay can be a bit clunky at the worst of times, but usually I don't have any problems with it.\nSolo play is decent because your AI teammates are fairly competent (not perfect, but decent), especially the healer who really uses her spells efficiently.\nCooperative is great. I've got a lot of fun running through randomized dungeons with friends and strangers alike.\nDungeon Master mode is where I'm really loving this game though. I can't get enough of playing this mode.\nThere a lot of useless things you can do as DM, but there is also a lot of entertaining things you can do to keep the game fresh. My friends and I have spent many hours playing dungeons over and over again in this mode and loving every second of it. Trapping players and making them play a life or death game of trivia is rather entertaining I must say.\n\nThere are several different races and classes you can pick from, and each one matters. Each class has a wide and varied set of skill trees and a separate skill tree for your race too. Character customization is pretty decent too, though I have seen better.\n\nI'm very happy with how this game turned out and despite the negativity that swamps this game, I find it very solid and enjoyable and definitely worth the money I spent on it.

There shouldn't be an acceleration period.  Do you like clicking on a button multiple times to get it to do the thing that it's supposed to?  I don't.  I should only have to click a button once.  Also, when it finally does take, there seems to be a slight delay before anything happens.  I also don't like how the view fades out and then back in every time I talk to someone.  Not only does it take way longer than any such transition should take, it's completely unnecessary.  They could just move the camera a bit, or not do anything with the camera.  Instead, I've have to wait several seconds after clicking on someone before I can read what they're saying.  Everything feels like it's been drenched in molasses.

Most of these negative reviews are from hardcore D&D fans that wanted a 100% Pen and Paper version of the game.  First of all thats impossible to do with today's technology, and secondly that was never promised... all this "bait and switch" stuff is nonsense from people who must've never really looked into the game before purchasing or simply have unrealistic expectations.\n\nWhat you're getting here is a game that is heavily focused on the Online Multiplayer experience.  This is why every skill is CD based and there is no Camping to recharge your daily powers.  That system just works better in a game that is trying to be friendly to a PUG, drop-in drop-out experience that anyone who isn't playing with a core group of friends will experience.  This even applies to the Story Campagin, which is something you wont find in any other CRPG, but of course you can turn that off, or limit it to friends only if you wish.\n\nThe map editor and DM are robust and offer a great deal of freedom.  But again hardcore Pen&Paper players are upset that you can't create custom loot like General LOLpants Blazing Long Sword +20 of Fireballs, like you could in a regualr game of D&D.  Again, those limitations are there for what should be obvious reasons that are apparently lost of many of the negative reviews.\n\nSo thats the gist of it.  If you wanted a fun Online Multiplayer CRPG in a classic D&D setting, that offers the possibility of near limitless content thanks to it Dungeon/Campagin creator this is the best thing out there.  If you wanted a carbon copy of the Pen&Paper game, with all its limitless possibilities due to the nature of human imagination, then  just like everything else from the last 25+ years, this is once again not your game.","October 24, 2015","true","11.0"," 59 of 109 people (54%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","54","59","109","5","9"

Theres been a lot of bad reaction from people disappointed with the game not being a strinct translation of DnD and not fully delivering on the DM game promised, so I'll be clear - I dont care about either of this things, I just want to enjoy a good RPG romp.\n\nAnd so far I'm finding th SP campaign really enjoyable, being set on the Sword Coast the names and places are familiar and pronouncable, a big advantage for quick emersion over games like PoE.  The main story line has quality voice overs and the plot makes sense and has a personal reason to get involved rather just must save the world.  It also seems that it would be equaly playable as a do gooder or a completely self interested character, a big plus thats often missing in this genre.\n\nTo me the advantages of the DnD license are lore and spells etc familiar from the classic BG games rather than from pen and paper DnD and to that end they succeed in this games, yes there are skill trees and cool downs, but computer games suite these and they work well in my opinion.\n\nSo far I've found SCL to be a lot of fun and bring back more of the nostalga of the BG games than PoE managed.  Yes there are irritating issues, the non familiar controls take an hour to two to adjust too and the characters quickely get annoying repeating the same lines every time you ask them to move.

Random loot generation is fun, and the combat has some good ideas behind it, despite it not sticking to the D&D 5.0 rules sometimes.\n\nUnfortunately the issues with the game are minor points that gradually build up.  Pathing can be an issue with characters getting stuck, there are no stealth movement animations, some attack animations (crossbows) look as if they were made quickly, and lack the punch of its contemporaries, some of which are over 10 years old.  The UI is workable after messing around with the options menu, but nothing special.  The game sometimes has issues with coding optimization, with some slowdown, especially during transparent particle effects.  Loading time between areas also sometimes seems unneccessarily long.  The lack of a more interactive map showing recent quest givers is also a bit unintuitive.\n\nAs for the single player game, some of the campaign quests do not reference decisions you've made at all.

Granted the mode functions fine and the creation tools are intuitive even whilst a bit lacking, but the greatest downfall is N-Space's utter lies in that there was "TONS" of DM content being held back for the sake of spoilers.

Character progression seems limited as a wizard. The unlocks were rather dull and lifeless, unlike editions 2/3/5. I'm honestly not sure whether this is some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized 5E, or whether I glossed over the manual.\n\nPotions last for about 1 - 2 minutes, as do most of the summons. Hope you like recasting.\n\nPlaying solo simply wasn't fun. I could see wanting to play with people, but...there are actual fun games to do that with. I've played for two hours. If you don't have me clamoring for more by then, I'll shrug and set it aside. It also gets frustrating when, say, the only fighter in your group (an  NPC no less) runs off and leaves you to handle a boss fight with two wizards (one was me), a cleric, and a rogue. I got my ♥♥♥ kicked. I'd have thrown my controller, if I'd had one.\n\nI was simply bored. Everything seems so mechanical and lifeless. The graphics are dull. You can only zoom in so far, to see a whole lot of Blah.\n\nPerhaps there is something salvageable if you really, really are keen on Faerun...but there's that Neverwinter MMO that is much, much more interesting than this.\n\nThere are better games than this, in the same game format as this, at the same price point as this.\n\nI'm glad I played this on the free weekend.

Based on 5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons, this game allows you to create a character complete with a full stat buy, proficiencies, and increases based on your background, race, and more. Trael the Sword coast, fight monsters, and even partake in stat challenges.\n\nLike many games in the genre you can import and export characters, allowing you to play and level up a character, then start the game over again at a higher level. Often this is used to allow a player to level up their character time and again. The multiplayer is interesting as players can swap out equipment, allowing experienced players to play with new characters created by friends, and buff their friends with equipment they have no need for, etc.\n\nThe story is interesting and unfolds like most stories told in the fashion of Baldur's Gate. A great evil is coming, and you're having nightmares about it. Meanwhile you're hunted down by one faction or another who want you dead for different reasons., most commonly being the money.\n\nSidequests tend to be unusual, I ran into a situation where I went back to complete a quest and we ended up with a glitch that kept the quest active though it should have ended. It was a quick fix to load my character back in, but then there was the hassle of going through the story up to that point again, and so on.\n\nUltimately I give it a 7.5 out of 10.","May 5","true","19.4"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","17","29","0","0"

Its like the game can't decide wants it wants to be. It seems set up like an mmo, where you are supposed to alternate through your abilities through using the 1-9 buttons, yet the controls are crap. Amazingly, In a game where you direct a party around, there isn't even a select all button!\n\nWorse,  the developers decided to remove so many options from D&D 5th edition that its plays like a half-hearted mmo of D&D. For example, they completely gutted the wizard. You don't choose spells for example, you select abilities off a drop down tree straight out of a copy and paste mmo, thats it.\n\nThis is a game designed for some spastic clicker, not for someone looking to play real D&D online. And even for all the clicking, the combat is boring! Just so grindy and samey, just bland :(. On top of that, the story is even worse. Really people, 2015 and unskippable dialogue!  This game forces you to list to its every god-awful plot dump and every god-awful conversation! That is inexcusable.\n\nIn short, If you want a good single player D&D like experience, play Pillars of Eternity, which has great combat and a good story.

If you are buying this game to play with friends know this, they have issues on THEIR SIDE, not all computers can connect with multiplayer. At first I checked my stuff including but not limited to:  Compatability, my router, my firewall, etc thinking what was wrong on MY SIDE?  Why can I play multiplayer on other games on Steam or Blizzard but not this game?  Come to find out, my side was good and when I went to the forums I read that this is a COMMON ISSUE (THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF BUT NOT WARNING PEOPLE ABOUT) and they've had since November 2015 (When they became aware of the issue) and STILL haven't fixed, nor have they taken the responsibility to warn people about this issue while racking up the sales (This is borderline theft as they don't give you what they've promised and have had AMPLE time to fix this issue).  So yeah I'd say this game is great as single player, seemed fun, but was NOT THE REASON I bought the game, and with as much money as they are pulling in, when we hit 2 months now and the developers or game coders still can't fix it (You start to lose hope that they'll ever fix it).  This is a major problem.  I didn't buy this game for single player but to play with my friends, and now find myself with the game uninstalled until they can fix the issue on THEIR side (Not feeling very confident at this point that they'll fix it).  They should have a warning of some sort, as I said I feel like this is borerline theft as I paid for the WHOLE game and only got single player because there is bugs in their code.  I'm not trashing the game itself because as I said it looks fun and it got me to buy the special addition, and I'd be willing to change my review if this gets fixed and I'm allowed to play with my friends, but until then you can MORE than understand why I'm let down and extremely upset as I'm like the next person who doesn't like to waste money paying for something that you don't get in return, that's a breach of contract and it's a sad thing.

Good depth to the game, once you get the idea of using the map and finding the start and finishes to sub-quests the whole thing gels well. Pause is essential when playing solo giving you tiikme to think and allowing you to play harder fights pseudo turn based. If you are tactically aware all fights are achievable. I'd say do all tthe sub quests to level up as much as you can, there is a finite amount of exp in the game as you traverse the main plot line so make the most of it to maximise your power for the finale.

This is kinda of a critisism for many game developers for this type of game regardless of the specifics of the gameplay and thats that the story fallows a typical path.  Granted its worked for years but I am just board with ending up in the "Big City" and solving a murder or some crap.  I know D & D has a vast writing community and it would be cool to see a very different take on the start of a games campaign.

It blends a little of Neverwinter Nights and a little Dargon Age to create game that isn't strictly either, and at least for me it proves an enjoyable blend. The combat mechanics don't try to direclty simulate DnD rules in its entirity, wich in my mind is a good thing as DnD rules were never meant for direct translation into a computer game. In Sword Coast Legends your characters all gain various abilities you purchase with points gained by leveling up, and most abilities are on a cooldown timer, or otherwise grant some passive bonus. Battles are largely about timing those abilities and knowing how they synergize with each other, combined with prioritizing your targets. Some fights can become challenging if you don't make the best use of your abilities, and if things feel to easy you can raise the difficulty and also select options that reduce some of the game's more friendly combat features like the ability to stablize dying companions in combat. Overall I found fights just challening enough to be stimulating, kind of like Dragon Age: Origins, if not quite as intense.\n\nThe story is alright so far. I haven't finished the single player campaign yet so I can't judge all of its components, but the main plot is serviceable if a tad basic. I found its strength so far to mostly be the party members who journey with the character I've made, as each has a fairly distinct personality and background that I've enjoyed learning through chats at the camp and doing their side-quests, and they have entertaining banter as we adventure around. Heck, they've been more memorable than most the characters in the first Neverwinter Nights, none of which I can remember except for the kobold bard Deekin.\n\nBoth graphics and audio get the job done without really having anything that stands out. The music neither inspires nor grates, the graphics show me what needs to be shown without wowing me, and the voice acting is... actually rather decent, overall. So no offense here.\n\nIf I level any major complaints towards the game its the lack of overall roleplaying options in a roleplaying game set in what is arguably DnD's mot well known setting. Yes you got dialouge options, and can sometimes use your stats to persuade or intimidate an NPC, I never got the feeling I was able to define my character beyond basic responses. The dialouge options available to your character are just kind of limited and dry, and more than that there's little in the NPC dialouge that makes you feel like they're talking to your distinct character. For example, I rolled up a drow fighter, because its Forgotten Realms and if I'm not going to make a Drizzt clone then what's the point of Faerun even existing? Joking aside, I was disapointed there was zero dialouge or respone to my drow character actually being a drow. In fact *spoiler tag for main storyline* one of the characters your encounter and work with eventually reveals himself to be a drow, which your party treats like a big betrayal of trust, accusing him of lying and basically calling him a dirty drow... all the while I'm standing there, drow as a demonic spider orgy, and none of them had responded to that fact once the entire story.\n\nSo, yes, the story could've used some expansion to include more roleplaying options, but other than that, I've had fun.\n\n7/10, will keep adventuring as a dirty drow that apparently has the world's most clever disguise of wearing a helmet.\n","January 31","true","36.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I had a good time playing it at first, until I got to Luskan and the story felt like it got derailed by a ton of distractions.\n\nThings I liked about the game:\n- It has a good character creation system.  It includes a lot of options, facial customization, subrace, background story, as well as stat modifiers based on most of those choices.\n- The look of the game is all right.  It's better than it's predecessors.\n- The music is decent, I liked it.\n- It conveys the feel of a D&D game well.\n- Despite distractions, the story is neat.  I like the idea of it and it compels me to continue playing in spite of all my other complaints.\n\nThings I didn't like about the game:\n- It has some pretty severe optimization issues for a lot of people, myself included.  I can't run the game at anything higher than the lowest settings due to the game overheating my card.  My card normally runs at around 55-60C with any other game, but somehow this game has managed to push my card to temperatures exceeding 80C.  I'm hoping this gets   fixed in the future.\n- There is no easy way to get details about creatures you are fighting.  No right-click -> Examine functionality.  The closest you can get to this functionality is to use the journal and try to locate the enemy in the bestiary, and some creatures are missing from this screen.\n- The camera won't zoom in enough for you to be able to see the facial customizations you made at creation.\n- The camera often locks you into very awkward angles preventing seeing things on the ground.  There are many times where the camera hard-locks me into a top-down view without letting me zoom to see smaller items on the ground.\n- There is no setting to increase the rotation speed of the camera, making that a bit of a chore as well — the camera just needs a lot of love.\n- Interacting with any NPC zooms and locks in your camera as though it were an important story aspect.\n- Dragging abilities to the power bar has an unexpected delay– you have to hold the mouse down for a second in order to move anything around, which doesn't really make sense when you are in the skill menus; I could understand such functionality while in combat, but this is a 100% of the time deal.\n\nOverall, it's an all right game with lots of issues which will hopefully eventually be resolved.  I think my biggest problem with it is that I can't stop myself from comparing it to the original Neverwinter Nights series, which was excellent in so many ways.  It leaves me wishing that the original engine could just be modernized and expanded.\n\nI'm still going to play it to completion because the story is interesting.  However, I would not currently recommend this game to anyone I know.  Maybe eventually, but not currently.\n","January 17","false","43.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

They tried something new and some things work and some things don't, BUT... They are working at fixing some of it. One of the biggest flaws i've heard people complain about is the lack of customization with DM mode when it first came out. Another was it's not HARDCORE to the PnP rule set. I guess people like myself and the many friends I play it with just are able to look passed those things as with the first 2 Community Patches they have added SO MUCH conent to the dm crafting and there is more beeing added consistantly. They already have ALLOWED MODDING, so the Modding community will change the things these whinners are complaining about. As far as rulesets go, this is one of the more enjoyable d&d experiences I've had.\n\nI'm Going to focus on the Negatives for a moment as to what I beleive are the worst. I had a hard time getting passed level 5 as I felt it was going slow. I hate the current single player AI, they are just plain stupid. They could really add in the old BG AI system or Dragon Age AI system with spells and health and such.\n\nI waited till the free weekend to try it out and I am very happy i gave it a shot. I read soooooooooooooooooooooo many bad reviews and watdched a bunch of gameplay footage on youtube and I was like... where are these bad reviews coming from. So trying it myself and leaving the reviews where they belong(in the trash) I started my journey in the Sword Coast Legends. First thing I did was played for about 18 hours. Then I some how convinced my brother and friend to give it a shot. Within 2 hours we were having a Blast. I've now 200 hours invested in the game and I wanted to write a review as I would say about 70% of the bad reviews come from people with Locked profiles or only 2 hours max in game, lots even 5 mins....... (Thats saying a lot about the review you are getting)\n\nThe DUngeon Master Module building is jsut awesome. I've invested over 65 hours into 1 module of my series. I didn't realize how much fun it would be to build a story how I want to tell it. And the excitement to play it is just awesome sharing it with friends. Adding in my own mobs, names and humor that my friends will enjoy as well as other.\nSure it needs work, needs more options, need more features in dialog and commands, but those things are coming. New tiefling race already coming and a class to go with it, so they are bringing more and more content out.\n\nJust do me a favor and if you don't buy it now, if and when there is another free weekend, Definatly Give It A Go and I know you will or atleast most of you who keep questioning it Will Love It.\n\nI give it a 8.5 outta 10 atm, but as more content and features are added my rating will only go up.  IF you would like anymore info you can usually catch me on http://www.twitch.tv/jaizek As i have been streaming the building of my module and explaining things to others. Its a Great supposrtive community.\nHope to see you in game.\n\nCheers","December 31, 2015","true","408.5"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

The only problem I see with this game is the lack of community support. There just isn't enough people playing the game to get a full match of players and a DM.

I feel like I should start off with that, cause it's important to note I don't hate this game. But it's still very clunky and frustrating at times, both as a player and DM. It got some things right in ways I find great, like having a DM and having killed enemies drop items the DM can use in a session. But at the same time, there are way more things it did wrong, like not giving the DM any control whatsoever on what loot can be offered where and when. The closest interaction a DM can have with loot is to place treasure chests down, and even then you can't decide what's in it. Just that it's there, and only a certain amount of chests can be placed in a session across multiple maps. Not being able to make your own companions for DM sessions with friends is frustraing, and I don't see the option as dropping friendly characters as being the same thing. Honestly this feels like a very cool in-beta game versus a finished one, and the idea this could ever be priced at $40 blows my mind. I could maybe talk myself into paying $20, but the fact there's supposedly already DLC for it and it's in this state makes that hard to do. In all honesty, I don't see myself playing this much once the free weekend ends. Sorry. I want to love this game, but I just can't get past some of the restrictive, clunky, cheap-feeling flaws and glithces.","December 18, 2015","false","13.9"," 23 of 41 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","23","41","0","0"

The only nitpicks I have thus far are some game-breaking bugs (quest triggers not triggering, quests disappearing entirely after loading a save), and the fact that the art style of the weapons, armor, and clothing can't be taken seriously, i.e. it isn't based on real world examples, and also seems a bit haphazard even for a fantasy game, as if it lacks an overall cohesive theme/direction, but these are personal preferences.\n\nOtherwise, the gameplay is entertaining and has some features that other games in this genre simply don't have.  It's worth the base price of $40, but the Deluxe ed. definitely feels like a bit of a rip-off and is geared towards those who simply must have everything available to them as the Dungeon Master.\n\nSo long as the developers keep improving the game and expanding the content, it will have a place in my library until something that can do all of the same things better comes along.","October 22, 2015","true","57.5"," 23 of 41 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","23","41","0","0"

It feels a lot like each of these games in ways but the execution is poor with the game mechanics and user interface choices. Also, the game is based off the 5th edition of D&D rules. I like 3rd edition best not this newer stuff. I like needing spell components and having to only have X number of pre-slotted spells a day not this MMO cooldown style.\n\nThe story was okay from the bit I played but nothing that was overly intresting from the beginning. I dunno, I just was not very happy with the product. Having to micromanage 5 character's inventories was the last straw for me... let me explain this. So you pick up a potion of regeneration, right? This now goes into your character's quickslot automatically. I don't want it in there because I want to save it! Then I have to remove it, no biggie right? Well it also goes into EVERY other character's quickslot bar too! So I have to remove that for everyone as well. Kind of a pain. It does not stop there! Later on if I loot that same potion of regneration it will go BACK into the quickslot bar! The few hours I played it was a constant tug of war to remove items like this and keep them out. Just ugh!\n\nYou cannot zoom down far at all. The game ran poorly for me on my system. The skill tree system looked cool at first but to me it was a design flaw. Just to hard to see things. Maybe the player made modules are better... the ones where you play a single character. But as for the long campaigns? No.\n\nThe combat system was not overly impressive either. Not for me. These are my thoughts: if ou want to play a fun action D&D game that actually follows the rules well try Dungeons and Dragons Online. There are some paywalls but its enjoyable and has a lot of free content. See my other review about that. Or you could buy Neverwinter Nights 1 or 2 from GOG.com if you wanted to play on a RP server. See my profile for links to that. The next best thing I can compare this to is Dragon Age: Origins. I loved that combat and it had a good story. Very fun game :) Sword Coast legends feels like DA:O  in some ways but seriously DA:O is way better.\n\nIf you like MMO-ish CD quickslot style combat and want a top down isometric RPG (like this is YOUR THING) this might be a decent one for you to try if its on sale. I will warn you about the UI once again though. They designed it poorly. The story seemed alright. It did make me laugh and smile a bit. Good voice acting and the writing was alright. It was not enough to sway me to keep it.\n\nThe mixed reviews were accurate. I'll give this one a 3/5\n\nNOTE: The game was given to me by a friend. I am going to stop at 4 hours of gameplay and have them request a refund.  If they won't let him refund it I may just delete it from my account.","May 22","false","18.2"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","3"

It is hard to create content that doesn't require a DM to facilitate the game and I understand that a lot of people want this (myself included). However, the tools that are provided are intuitive and easy to use.

I had hopes for a Bulder's Gate/Pillars of Eternity style game, which I think that the advertising suggested. Instead, it plays like an ISO port. It feels like a low-budget touch screen game brought over to Steam with no effort at making it more PC friendly, which is a shame because if they had then the game could have been drastically improved.\n\nWhat I played the most is the single player campaign. The writing is ok and the story line about what one might expect from a Sword Coast focused game. The tactical game, though, is painful. You control one character at a time with the AI controlling the rest. The AI uses abilities and there is no way to control when they do so, as one could in Dragon Age: Origins. Abilities that needed to be used at just the right time could easily be used at the wrong time by the AI. Another problem is that there is no way to set party formation, as one can in BG and PoE. Instead, everyone just charges in or, if the wait function is on, you have to micro manage each character, at all times. While the ability animations may be nice, combat quickly falls into ability spam fests and gets tiresome.\n\nI would recommend BG I and II, PoE, Divinity, Icewind Dale I and II, or even Wasteland 2 or Fallout I or II before this game. for single player.

I wasn't able to buy it at first because I didn't have the money. Glad that this was the case as this game did not meet my expectations.\n\nNow I know you've heard it all before on failing to meet expectations but I knew this before I began the free weekend. I really had the feeling as if I was playing Diablo except that every enemy I met was a bullet sponge. I played a couple of D&D based games before like BG and NWN and I absolutely enjoyed them. I also have played games like Diablo, Torchlight and PoE and I've also enjoyed those games. This game feels like it's trying to be both.\n\nIn any case there were a few things mechanically I personally did -not- like. Perhaps these are because of the 5e edition DnD but regardless I didn't like them. Since the fact they didn't completely follow the guidebook perhaps they should've reconsidered the following things:\n\n-Skill tree(s) : It's one thing to have feats/skills that have a requirement it's whole different story when spells get into the mix. Also the tiered skills and spells could definatly have been replaced by more passives or abilities.\n\n-Stealth : I played a Thief/Rogue at lvl 10. Maximized the stealth skills and had extra stealth on my items, still got spotted by every single thing in every single room. There was 0 chance on avoiding a fight, this makes me very sad.\n\n-Cooldowns : Previous games had abilities, spells and skills that you could only do like 1/day or something like that. Which was fine as you would just camp somewhere before engaging in a next fight. Now you have cooldowns, on which some skills can take AGES. Arrow of Slaying, 200 second cooldown. I compared the damage with my bow rogue when I came out of stealth (on the rare occasion I wasn't spotted) with maxed out sneak attack. And the damage is the same, except stealth you can spam every 5 seconds for that 1 attack. Also sneak attack is the ONLY reason to even be rogue.\n\n-Overall Simplicity : No more weapon specifics like damage and hit. Doesn't even tell you the save rolls you make right off the bat. Overall there's too many details missing to actually know what you're doing. Lots and lots of junk items. No action queueing.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nIt's not that the game is bad, it just wasn't really enjoyable for me. It might be for you, but personally I can't recommend it. It raised expectations, failed to meet them. Came out over-simplified. Seemingly tried to take the best out of 2 worlds but didn't quite make it. Need to waste some time?, this is a fine game.

The game, if we forget the part where it is definitely not a D&D game, it's not that bad, ok but... but there are plenty of non D&D games much better (I rather Dungeon Siege instead this one). First of all, the game requires and force you to create an account before allow you to see a menu or do whatever, so... WTF. Its story is too typical, dull, not remarkable. So much missed potential here, the world is easily forgotten. Character creation is simplistic, the combat system it's ok, but like others standard dungeon crawler. The graphics are meeh, animations, scenarios... Neverwinter Nights 2 (released in 2006) looks almost identical (and of course is a masterpiece, and a real D&D game) so... what's the point to buy this game? The Sword Coast was the scenario of some of the best games ever made (Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale), you cannot call your game like that and not make a work of art, you cannot work in Dragon Age Origins and do this... No. This is not the game we deserved and is not the game we expected. If you want a truly D&D game or just a great role-playing, just revisit the classics, the holy trinity (Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale & Planescape Torment), Neverwinter Night 1 & 2 (Mask of the Betrayer, yes, please), The Temple of Elemental Evil or the new masterpieces Pillars of Eternity or Divinity Original Sin. But this one, no, I cannot recommend it (especially if you like all those previous games which I named). If you do not want any of that, you only want a simple, unremarkable, superficial and a bit enjoyable role-playing game, you can give it a try.","December 17, 2015","false","0.7"," 47 of 88 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","47","88","0","8"

The nomenclature "Dungeons and Dragons" is not to be thrown around lightly when fans are as passionate about the subject matter and gameplay style as DnD fans have proven to be.  Few negative reviews have pointed out anything beyond the fact that the game is not NWN 3.  I do not believe that this was the intention of the developers as much as it was the HOPE of the gaming community.\n\nThe old Infinity Engine and NWN games are among my favorite PC games of all time, but that being said, I still found much enjoyment in SCL.  Without these legendary games to serve as a basis of comparison, I feel Sword Coast Legends would have received much higher praise from the gaming community.  It has an enjoyable single player campaign, with a well fleshed out storyline, great voice acting, and does provide opportunity for tactical, graphically pleasing gaming.  The DM mode is simplistic but has enormous potential if the developers choose to expand upon the concept in future updates.\n\nNo it is not the spiritual successor of NWN, but it does serve as an easy to pick up and play experience for those just breaking into the world of DnD and does a great job introducing new players to the lore.  My hope is that the accessability of SCL will attract new interest in DnD, growing the future demand for games based on this liscense, much as Baldurs Gate Dark Alliance 1 and 2 did years ago.\n\n8 out of 10 with room to grow.

To me - and I played a lot of Baldur's Gate and NWN this is an excellent modernization of that ongoing franchise.\n\nParty make up is quite flexible - and with four members you can switch between leaders on-the-fly, and also choose whether to control all party members in every action they take or simply play the one you want and let the rest act as AI controlled henchmen.\n\nI've found battles to be both interesting and challending, the graphics are really nice (particularly if you zoom in to see things up close, althought that can be problematic during combat when you want a good field of vision.\n\nI haven't played pen & paper D&D v5 so can't comment on the accuracy of SCL vs that, but the ability selections are quite varied and rewarding letting you customize your team as you wish (and yes, you also control the leveling up of your henchment/party members).\n\nThe quests for the most part are pretty good, puzzles take some thought, the game doesn't lead you by the nose like some do - your brain is a valuable accessory; you should want to use it from time to time.\n\nI've also played player created modules and found them a lot of fun. First time I did that I didn't realize I'd started a public game until two voices came out of the speakers saying "Hi, Krystyn" but we all went along together and had a great time.\n\nCamera control is 360 degrees which is great, allowing you to view the battle from any/every angle.  I admit to playing a mostly tactical game, pausing fairly often in combat to give specific party members commands - but in the multiplayer no one paused and we just played fully in real time. Both were fun.  :-)\n\nIn summary, if you're looking for a D3 or Path of Exiles hack and slash that runs along with fast and furious action, this probably isn't for you. But if you enjoy thinking, planning the battles, using your brain - in other words playing Chess rather than just running along as fast as you can and reacting to whatever chance brings your way - I'd strongly recommend SCL.  I'm enjoying it, can't wait to take some time to create & post some mods, and expect this will have a long lifespan for me.","October 24, 2015","true","46.2"," 32 of 59 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","32","59","2","0"

It's a slow, clumsy, cluttered resource hog with unpredictable and unreliable AI and what seems to be its own form of always-online DRM. This game is influenced more by Diablo III than the "Baldur's Gate" or "Icewind Dale" games (or even Diablo I or II) and that's absolutely not a compliment. The graphics are pretty disappointing, especially given how many resources it devours. The classes and races are extremely limited (they're probably reserving the rest for DLC) -- Fighter, Cleric, Wizard, Rogue and Halfling, Human, Dwarf, Elf were it, if i recall -- and the mechanics are more "MMO" than "RPG."Also, each sex has only four voice options, which are the same regardless of race; so your Dwarf Cleric may sound exactly like someone else's Human Fighter who may sound exactly like that other player's Elf Wizard. It feels EXTREMELY limited, yet oddly overstuffed. I actually wound up giving up and uninstalling it halfway through the first chapter, just because it felt like I was playing in molasses with only a third of the game I wanted to play.\n\nI will say, it has beautiful music and a solid (if predictable) story in the single-player campaign, with pretty great voice-acting and reasonably robust character *face* customization!","November 12, 2015","false","15.3"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","19","34","0","0"

You'll get wrecked by goblins 1 on 1.\n-Abilities are absolutely useless compared to auto attacks\n-Items are completely out of control. Zero cooldowns and 75%+ action speed increases later on.\n-All of the broken items can be put into a chest for your other characters to use. So lvl 1 with the best gear possible.\n-DM mode is weak.\n-Mod building is even weaker. It's 90% random even though "you build it"\n\nThe one real plus this game has going for it is a decent story mode. But really, it's just decent though the playthrough might be worth your $20. Other than that though it's pretty much a train wreck. As stated before the abilities are useless compared to auto attacks for all classes. Later on in the game (character levels) you'll get a plethora of items that give you "cooldown reduction %" so that your ability cooldowns are no longer 20 seconds to 6 minutes (yes 6 minutes for a couple abilities that are bad). In fact you can get 100% cooldown reduction so that you don't have any! Sounds great but the only abilities you'll use are the ones that bolster your auto attacks. For reference I have a lvl 20 fighter that uses a super pimp longbow, gets 5 attacks per round, has zero cooldown on abilties (so infinite +50% action speed), +75% action speed from items, and crits on something like 6-20. So that's basically 11 attacks per round that almost always crit. And you can do this with any class. Quite literally nothing can stand in front of you for more than about 2 seconds.\n\nBut why can't anything stand up to that? A sly mod builder could certainly build to counter your uber character right?\n\nNo. The mod building system is supremely gimped. Nearly everything is randomized and you can't even control what kind of equipment/ability scores the monsters/npc's will have. Mod builders are basically forced to make vanilla characters. This lack of authority stretches to other areas of mod building as well; can't put specific items anywhere. It's all random.\n\ntl;dr - You start off pathetically weak and end up godly within less than 30 hours with absolutely no reason to continue playing.","January 3","false","84.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

For one thing, your character's race, alignment, religion, and background have virtually no impact on the story at all. One of your companions who greatly distrusts and hates the Drow apparently has no reaction towards your character being a Drow. Yet when you encounter another drow companion, she goes into full on paranoia like she's expecting them to stab the whole party in their sleep!\n\nThere is also no way to double check your character's flavor build after you leave character creation, short of writing it into your bio. Once you finish character creation, there's no way to check what your alignment or your deity is. But the worst part is that this also extends to the Ranger's racial enemy as well!\n\nOne of your companions, is a Ranger. But I can't tell what they're supposed to be good at killing, because it doesn't list it anywhere for them. Not even so much as giving a hint in their character bio!\n\n\nThe story is played on a railway system with the only significant choices appearing to be whether or not you kill people / recruit them to join you. Even if you're playing an evil character who wants to slaughter the world, there's no "evil ending" that lets you side with the main villain, or at the very least usurp their power. You have to be the hero!\n\n\nEven the module creation needs some working on. From what I can tell, the equipment you have available in DM mode is dependent on what gear you have come across during your adventures. The first time I tried to make a module, the list of equipment I could give to NPC's was extremely limited. But after I found a bunch of loot on my own play throughs, I found the available selections had opened up. What this basically means is that you need to grind as a PC before you can make a good module as a DM!\n\nYou also can not pick the reward that quests give you when creating a module. You can decide whether or not it gives you gold, but you have to pick "Random" on whatever kind of weapon / armor / trinket that it gives you. You also can not custom design weapons / armor / trinkets. Which I can kind of understand, but it's still disappointing.\n\n\nThose who are accustomed to D&D games and the crap load of spells and abilities they have to offer, may be off put by the skill tree system, but it's actually not so bad once you get accustomed to it. The downside is that some of your companions will have access to trees that are exclusive to them, even if you're playing as the same class.  For example, the Deception tree is part of the Wizard class, but one of your companions can learn it. This comes across as being unfair and detracts from the idea of building the character you want to play.\n\n\nIf you're looking for a hack and slash dungeon crawler, then Legends of the Sword Coast is fun to check out. But if you're hoping for a role playing experience, you're going to be disappointed.","May 29","false","67.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Sadly, it's not a great game, but it is fun for those who like the Forgotten Realms setting and Lore.  The story is a little vanilla, the characters lack that sparkle from previous games and the number of classes and races are very limited.  However, it has that Forgotten Realms vibe, along with some cheeky and knowing humour which reminds me of BG2.  Additionally, for once, the wizard and cleric character and ability trees are really interesting, perhaps even a little over powered.  You do get to chuck a lot of spells about as your fighter just sits around sucking up the heat.\n\nThe two biggest problems to date are loadng times between places and very uninteresting loot.  These can be easily fixed.\n\nNot a DM, so can't really comment on that stuff.\n\nIf you like a bit of single player rpg action, this isn't a bad bet to while away 40 hours in a familiar way.

Yes, it has a few "challenges" that could stand some improvement, but they are not total game breakers unless you choose for them to be. SCL has three different game "types" within two distinct game modes. You are either a player or a DM within the main story, a user-created campaign, or an in-game generated dungeon cawl. All of these game types can be open to the public or private parties for friends. The game installs with plenty of content and choices to keep you busy for quite a while, with more to be delivered soon.\n\nWhile many players and reviewers lament that SCL is not the second coming of Neverwinter Nights, there is no doubt in my mind that the game can achieve a status similar to that legendary title.\n\nMy recommendation is thumbs up.\n~","January 3","true","66.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/torsryk/recommended/325600/","torsryk","Torsryk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/torsryk/","192 products in account","Sword Coast Legends (SCL) received a mixed bag of reviews upon its release; many with fair points of criticism.  In the months since, however, the devs have listened well to the community and have really tackled a lot of the complaints that were raised at the time.  This is not to say the game has been perfected, but it’s come a fair way since October and definitely deserves a positive rating now.  Bear that in mind when looking at reviews of this game here on Steam.\n\nAs a long time fan of D&D, I want to love this game.  That is not to say that I have walked blindly into this and determined to see only the positives, but I’m glad to say that I really do like what's been created here and it has got a lot of positives about it and a HELLUVA lot of potential.  If the devs remain committed to it throughout 2016 and maybe even beyond, perhaps keeping it up to date with the story seasons of D&D itself and expanding the DM mode, there is perhaps a classic in the making here.  With Pillars of Eternity bringing the cRPG genre back to the fore and Beamdog about to release Baldur’s Gate 1.5, SCL has arrived at a period of resurgence in this genre and, being a D&D product, has a lot to live up to with BG, NWN and ID all as brilliant forebears to this iteration.  Overall, it’s probably on a par with some of the weaker of this group (which is a great achievement in such esteemed company!) but perhaps falling short of the scope and depth of the strongest and not on a par with PoE, but again, this is a great game in its own right.\n\nVisually, SCL is a beautiful game with a lovely blend of the artistic style of D&D and a richly detailed fantasy world.  It’s no Skyrim in this regard, but such a comparison is pointless as they are two very different games.  For a cRPG, it is beautiful to play within.  The one annoyance I have is not quite having complete control of the camera and to do so would only enable players to more fully enjoy the amazing world of Faerun as presented here in SCL.  The soundscape is nicely attuned to a variety of settings and ranges from relaxing ambient noise to chilling effects that really enhance the overall atmosphere.  Magic is particularly great, not only to watch but to listen to through an intense battle.  The ferocity and intense action is all the more pervasive with the carnage of battle ringing in your ears!  The music by Inon Zur (BG2, ID2, Dragon Age, Fallout, LOTR: War in the North, need we go on?!?) is brilliant adding yet another layer of atmosphere to a game that is already soaked in it.    Finally, the voice acting is very strong with confident writing shining through the performances which balance the best bits of D&D’s slightly tongue in cheek style with enough dramatic punch to not leave you cringing.\n\nThe gameplay is quick and simple to pick up with a great variety of personalisation options available to each of your characters and a good deal of skill trees to pick a whole range of useful abilities from.  All of this really nicely echoes the flavour of classic D&D and really enhances the feeling you are playing a digital version of the tabletop game, more so than its predecessors with its more transparent mechanics and intuitive UI.  The party mechanics are simple yet effective and allow you to play as either the whole group or as an individual with your companions following you at the press of the button.  Inventory is shared between the whole party which is a nice little time saver if perhaps a little too over simplified for some.  Now admittedly, whilst SCL is overall  very much simpler than the likes of BG or PoE, it’s not so dumbed down to the point of being overly limiting.  They have struck a good balance here which will probably still annoy the players that want absolute control, but you can never please everyone and what they have achieved is arguably an almost optimal balance that will hopefully please the greatest proportion of players.\n\nWhat I think is the greatest achievement of the game is the feeling of playing D&D 5th edition.  In previous iterations such as BG, ID and NWN, the mechanics were there but felt overwhelming at times and hidden behind a fair bit of maths that would only be truly understood by putting the hours into the games or by a D&D player already familiar with the rules and mechanics.  In SCL, the mechanincs are clearly there but are simple to see, understand and grasp.  This is both a result of the great work by WoTC making 5th edition rules possibly the best yet but also the devs of SCL who adopted and adapted them really well to a video game with subtle changes made where necessary.  It really feels like a digital version of the tabletop RPG at times which, for me at least, is really exciting and satisfying!\n\nFinally, DM mode is an exciting return to the module creators of NWN 1 and 2.  Although technically a lot simpler and consequently less powerful, there is an interesting twist with players actually able to DM a game in that they play with and against the players in a spirit not too distant from its tabletop counterpart.  Whilst fun, it is incredibly difficult to create an experience that is anywhere near as deep as the traditional D&D DMing experience.  In my opinion, this is also where the game is the weakest and yet also has the greatest potential.  The limitations upon creating modules are so severe in places that it is truly claustrophobic for creative storytelling and I have found myself working harder to create a story within the confines of the mechanics of DM mode than creating the actual story or events themselves.  The devs, however, have been making efforts to improve and expand the mode with Community Packs, of which 2 have been released to date with a third promised and extra content for the Rage of Demons storyline.  Whether this will truly bring the potential of the module creator to the fore remains to be seen but if it does, it will be incredible.  The strong, cult community that still exists around the NWN module creator to this day is testament to the potential power of that and the deep desire for a quality product in the D&D and cRPG communities.","February 16","true","16.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Meaning 4 players act as the adventure party while a 5th person serves as the dungeon master.  This makes for a pretty cool multiplayer experience and is a great idea.  I imagine most of the people still committed to this game are here for this experience.\nThe problem is that the game's weakest feature is the combat system which is a shame because tremendous portions of a gameplay session are spent fighting monsters.\n\nThe combat system, animations and class mechanics are extremely dull.\n\nAnimations and sound effects related to combat lack any visceral feel to them and ultimately this makes every encounter feel lackluster.\n\nI'm not sure if it's the 5th edition ruleset holding these aspects of the game back or if the designers' interpretation of them is just uninspired.\n\nWizards of the Coast needs to consider a bigger investment in a more modern and more complete Dungeons and Dragons experience for the PC.  Even n-Space would probably be able to deliver something much better with more resources at their disposal.\n\nThe solution would be to consider a new, more visceral combat system and probably a fresh interpretation on all of the D&D character classes and how they can contribute to adventuring both in and out of combat.\n\nProps to n-Space though for continuing to make aggressive changes to the game to try and improve the experience for people who want to keep playing,  I wish them good luck.\n\nSome Feedback on the Postives Environment art looks fantastic\nThere are lots of multiplayer and cooperative opportunities available to the player.","December 22, 2015","false","3.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

The feel and look are very similar to Neverwinter Nights. (Currently fewer class options).  I have played through the main story once and loved it.  Most of the time the treasue was disapointing (but that is consistent with 5th edition rules, which scalled back the power of magic items for game balance).\n\nI also like the storage chest shared between my characteres.\n\nI have also spent quite a bit of time running dungeon crawls, both solo and with other players and found them are great ways to hack and slash with out needing to worry about quests or time constraints.  Being able to specify what tile set the dungeon uses as well as what monsters and bosses you face are a nice touch.\n\nThe module builder is severly limited. **Note: I have been a DM for about 3 years and am currently running a 5th Edition DnD campaign.  I have also put many hours into both of the Neverwinter Nights Tool Sets.\nCompairing the two, it like saying Sword Coast Legends' Tool Set is Elementary School and Neverwinter Nights Tool Set is College.\n\nI understand that the reason for the limitations is to retain game balance, but feel that the limitations go too far.  I cannot use an object as a transition point. (Tried using a well to transition into a cave dungeon)  A dm cannot even give specific quest rewards, only a random weapon, armor, or other. ( I wanted to give a specific cloak I saw in the game that gave some fire resistance as an initial quest reward)\n\nAll in all, it has replay value.  I first played through as a Halfling Rogue and look forward to playing the other classes and races.","January 17","true","71.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Which was a criticism from users. Instead what I got feels too much like Baldur's Gate and all those games, which frankly I never enjoyed and by now I've outgrown.\n\nThe game has good graphics, though nothing spectacular or special. It does pay attention to detail, and I think it could make an ok multiplayer experience, but it's outside my current tastes. I'd prefer a more hack & slash variant, closer to the Gauntlet remake, but with the customization detail of D&D.\n\nSo yeah, this is not a bad game and it could be enjoyable if you like the pace and the depth that's in between Baldur's Gate type things and more streamlined things like NWN. Not for me, pace is too slow and detail is a b it too much, I don't feel like investing time right now.\n\nI might come back to the game if it's dead cheap in a sale, because I like D&D a lot and there's not a lot of games, buyt currently it's too expensive.

This game holds up on its own but, because of those reviews, the game has a FAR worse score than it deserves and it is a shame.\n\nIt uses the D&D 5th edition rule set loosely and by loosely I mean it adheres to the base rules in regards of stats and character creation. part from that, your abilities are on cooldowns (something I've seen a lot of complaints over) and enemies are HP sponges; taking a ton of damage before they are defeated. Even your most powerful abilities will only appear to dent their HP and that is one of my lone complaints. Low level enemies can just swarm you and, due to their numbers and large HP pool, beat you down which might put some people off.\n\nIt is worth a look if you're a fan of the genre.","November 3, 2015","true","51.4"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

Battles would take  an hour to resolve as each player gets their turn, initiatives rolled, damaged dealt and received, laughs shared and omg we are going to die moments.  This is a at the heart of the feel I am looking for and why I looked into this game.\n\nIf you are looking for a game to play single player wise, it plays like a Baldur's Gate style game where battles can be paused to issue commands if you wish or go all out real time for quick instant gratification if you are so inclined.  It works fine for that style of play but you can easily get tired of it if you are on easy mode or frustrated if you are getting killed to quickly on harder difficulties.  This is fine to explore while you are waiting for your friends to come online to join in some adventures along the Sword Coast together.\n\n"Sword Coast Legends offers an all-new way to enjoy the time-tested magic of playing Dungeons & Dragons as a SHARED storytelling experience."\n\nSo does SCL deliver this experience? This is the big question.  The short amswer, almost but not quite yet.  If you came to this game to play with friends it works but without a pause or a timed pause feature it is very hard to recreate the table top feel.  The pausing has been disable in multiplayer because some players can be jerks and deliberately try to "ruin the experience" for others by pausing (and unpausing) too much. I can see multiplayer with pausing enable can increase the risk of ruing the game experience with abuse especially with strangers. But they really should have a system in place where the host of the game can pause, give permissions to pause, allow people on friends list only the ability to pause or a vote in game system to disable/enable pause permissions.  This would go along way to bring the table top feel to SCL.  Without the multiplayer pausing it takes away from that fundamental design element in the game, to bring the table top  feeling back where battles are discussed, strategies formed, excution is modified and the taste of victory shared by all (even the DM).\n\nIn essence, without pausing (timed or otherwise), multiplayer combat does not unfold in the same slower pace of a table top experience.  That seems to be the missing element(s).  If they do develop a system to modify the "pace" of the game (ie fast paced for those who like more of a hack & slash feel and slower for those who want a table top pace) this would make the game much closer to spot on where it needs to be.  Even a means to scale or adjust the level of combat speed in the game would be best versus the 2 extremes of with pauses or without.\n\nI will be watching this game for multiplayer improvements like pausing in the future.  I will happily purchase the game when this has been achieved substantially enough to make this aspect the game robust.  Until then I will hold back on the final purchase and keep an eye on the development of this game because I like the direction it seems to be going.","December 20, 2015","true","12.4"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

No, this is not Baulders Gate 3 or Neverwinter Nights 3, no this is not a 100% direct translation of the 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons ruleset.  But is this a failed attempt at creating a quality dungeons and dragons experience? No.  In what other game can I control a story while my friends play through it? Where can I have a deep mystery experience one night, a comedy adventure another night and a hack & slash fight fest the next? Sword Coast Legends is all these things as long as you put some effort into it and as long as you can arrange to play with others. This, in essence, is its problem. It needs other people  who are willing to invest into the experience. So if you have the will to join one of the Steam/online groups and are willing to put some imagination into the experience this game is a real gem. If you want to jump in and play by yourself, you may find your experience limited.\n\nSome have complained that the toolset is limited, and I have to be honest it does have some limitations. The developers however have shown that they are very willing to listen to the community and are working hard to make this into the game its players wanted. Personally I'm enjoying my time in this game, and I'm excited by where the developer and the modding community are taking it. For me nothing that has come out in recent years comes as close to the feeling of DnD than this game does.  The feeling where anything could happen, where I am creating my own story and where I'm doing that parallel to others creating their own story as well.  On sale this is a steal, full price its still worth its investment. Please buy it so I can see what you bring to the table as a DM and lets create a story together.\n\n*This is my first review with hundreds of games in my library.

If you are not willing to learn how to play a game, any game, then you are not a true PC Gamer of any sort.\n\nHearing your character say one of only 3 different things everytime you click the ground to move gets annoying.\n\nSome framerate issues, even when in menu while in game.I had to lower 2 shadow options on my i920.\n\nCombat is over very quickly on "Normal" setting, way too easy, "Hard" is probably better too start with. However, having said that the game gets challenging very quickly about 2 hours in, so you might want to decide for yourself.\n\nFor D&D rule affectionatos I do not believe the game is true to that ruleset, but I am not a D&D rules expert, so I will leave that for others to comment on. I say "Bad" only because I know people were expecting 100% D&D ruleset, thus thats a negative for some.\nFor me it does not matter.\n\nIn the prologue, a screen effect is used to hide parts of the map, looked kind of like the "I put on Saurons One Ring Effect. I did not like that at all. Fortunately, once you get out of the Prologue it goes away .\n\nAlthough, WASD screen movement combined with point and click character movement does not bother me, I know it bothers some people and frankly I prefer mouse movement to the border to move the screen as opposed to wasd.\nI can get used to it, but oh well.\n\nThere have been comparisons to Dragon Age, but frankly I do not see any similarity to those games as I liked DA Origins, I hated DA 2, and was indifferent to DA3.\nFor what its worth I enjoy this game so far, more than DA2 and 3.\nI am not sure yet if I enjoy it more than DA1.\n\nAlthough I did enjoy the classic D&D games "back"when they were originally released, I must confess I am less impressed with them in their enhanced versions ONLY because I played them already years ago and thus its nothing new to me.\nSo far, the "D&D feel" was a lttle better in those games.\n\nFade in and fade out after dialog with NPCs.\n\nDM Mode is not what players thought it would be based on advertising.\nHowever, I still feel it's worth it.\n\nThe UGLY -\n\nIMHO there is no "Ugly" aspect to this game.\nHowever, if you are a tried and true deep D&D fan in regards to the rules, then well.....\nFrankly, it matters not to me...but I can understand those that say "if its D&D it must have the D&D ruleset".\n\nCONCLUSION-\n\nOriginally based on the "mixed reviews" I was reading I had refused to buy this game.\nBut, a close of friend of mine who is very very picky with what games he likes told me he LOVED it after 8 hours of play.\nSo for me, that is all I had to hear to buy it.\nHowever, for those who arfe not friends with either he or I, I can understand how that would not matter to you.\n\nThus, if you are a hardcore D&D rule junkie you might want to wait.\nHowever, if you want a good RPG you can play with friends in coop, or single player that takes place in the D&D universe and is FUN, RELAXING, IMMERSIVE, and CHALLENGING then I say definately buy it.\n\nThe strength of this game is to gather your closest friends, so that they comprise your group, and then pour your favorite beverage into your favorite flagon, turn the lights off, light some candles, and immerse yourself back into a time when friends would gather around a table and play RPG games.","October 23, 2015","true","5.8"," 29 of 54 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","29","54","3","0"

I have 80+ hours into the game and I haven't even finished the story campaign. I can firmly recommend the game to any RPG player. It has a fun and engaging storyline campaign where you can choose to play single player or with up to 4 players in coop mode. It also has a dungeon crawl mode where you can play with up to 4 players in a party AND a Dungeon Master who controls things in the dungeon from a top down view. They can create monsters, buff monsters and add roleplay and story driven aspects as well as control them and the boss. The closest thing to being able to DM a video game to date that I have seen. Not only does it have these modes but it also has a campaign/module creation mode. In this mode you can completely customize a campaign from start to finish that up to 4 players can play and someone can DM. A lot of people give this game flak because it's not exactly dungeons and dragons. In my oppinion making a video game exactly dungeons and dragons is not only almost impossible. But, it just wouldn't be that fun. For the price point you get all of these features and they will be adding more detail to the module creation in the future. As it is the game is very well put together and provides more than enough bang for it's buck. If you like RPG and turn based RPG DnD type games I recommend this game.","October 27, 2015","true","158.1"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","10","17","0","0"

I was just looking for a fun ARPG.  SCL is ok, but that's it's problem: mediocrity.  I think you could find a lot of similar gameplay elements in better games.\n\nThere's a story, but the combat is definitely taking center stage here, and that's part of the problem for me, it never felt very well-designed.  In my party of four well-rounded characters, I never felt like any of the characters had any substantial crowd-control methods, for example.  And the "loot" situation isn't much better.  I picked up and found quite a bit of equipment during my adventures, but only one of two of the items I found were actually useful.  Any items that your "created" character can't use, you would normally want to equip on one of your other party members...the problem is, they all come with "specialized" gear that nearly always has better stats or bonuses than anything you will find.\n\nThe other issue I had was in leveling.  Yes, I know leveling in D&D is typically slow, and that wouldn't normally be so noticeable.  But when you see the MASSIVE amount of skills/abilities waiting to be unlocked as you play, you would expect a fairly steady progression.  But in the brief time I played (and I went through a LOT of combat, disarming traps, etc) my character leveled up ONCE.  That tends to make the gameplay feel pretty stale after a while, waiting to level up to try to open up some more useful skills.\n\nIn short, nothing in the game really grabbed my attention.  There is a little lore to discover as you talk to people and explore and you have dialogue choices when talking to people, but it all feels fairly shallow.  The combat, on the surface, feels like it wants to be deep and tactical, and the fights can get quite challenging, but the tedious progression makes it feel like a grind.","December 19, 2015","false","2.6"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","11","19","0","0"

Sword Coast Legends plays like Neverwinter Nights, Baldur's Gate, Diablo or any other isometric RPG. However in this particular case, it has a active pause battle system with very MMO like ability system - all skills has short cooldowns. Nothing much from standard D&D casts per day. You can pause game and issue orders or just use tactics - Companions AI is not bad, however it sometimes fail to notice combat begins and just stands still until you won't issue attack order again. Character development is based on ability trees. Personally seen only Wizard ones: Starts from one skill, then next levels unlocks another branches and spells. Not much from D&D spellbook: Most common offensive spells like Magic Arrow, Melf's Acid Arrow and Disintegration. No utility spells and only couple buffs like Mage's Armour or Magic Weapon. Inventory is very similar to Neverwinter Nights 2. Unfotunately books, scolls, notes and any lore items with descriptions also uses this system, so you won't experience something like Skyrim's books to read. Shame.\nStory from prologue does not sounds bad, however the form in which is presented to the Player is just bland. Good thing there is voice acting during cutscenes, which are dull and without any emotion. It's the first time I played RPG and was doozing off when story was unfold. This is probably most grave and repulsive flaw of this title. For 20 euro I can get Pillars of Eternity, which will give me many hours of gameplay. There I get (according to developers) 30 hours of singleplayer scenario and then ability to create own games with other Players. Unfortunately, it is not enough of promise to make me invest my money in this title. It has potential, but feels too meek in comparision with other RPG of this type available to choose Sword Coast Legends.\n","December 18, 2015","false","1.7"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

When I saw this I was excited and decided to give it a try despite the bad ratings since it has a free weekend going.  Unfortunately I was disappointed and here's why:\n\nThe game creators skipped a whole lot of relevant information for helping players determine the rulesets.  During character creation it is very difficult to find out what bonuses the different races, subraces, and origins give. I had to use a wiki to even figure out what bonuses were given for the origin choices.  The racials don't give any indication on what they give and the only way to figure it out is to pop back and forth between the different screens to try and figure out what has changed, or to try and find a resource online that shows the values, unfortunately the online wiki doesn't even have this information.  Overall there's a complete lack of contextual information during character creation that can drastically affect how your character performs.  This information has always been present in past games.  Sword Coast Legends does a terrible job at letting you know the rules it will be playing by which is unforgivable for a DnD video game adaptation.\n\nNow about the story: I played through the prologue, and the story elements are fine, but the story seems a bit forced.  You're a member of a cursed guild that no one thinks is legitimate etc etc. It is a bit frustrating however, that the story basically drops you in, jarringly, and you have no clue what's going on.  I think I would have received it a lot better if there was more backstory involved. As it is, the story tries to force you to care about characters very early in the game, but there has been no time to create a connection.\n\nThe combat system is fine, it works for this type of game although it does seem a little bit more sped up from previous titles. One of my gripes though is that spells and queued tasks aren't handled as intuitively as other titles.  It also doesn't seem to bear much relation to actual DnD with the skill tree system, and way it handles leveling.\n\nOverall I think this game could be a lot better it just needs to provide more contextual information about the actual ruleset to the user. If it can fix these problems (which shouldn't be very hard at all). It would be a lot better. Unfortunately it seems like this is more of a game type that is dumped out for the community to just deal with and not get direct support.

Or if you have played those games and did not enjoy them.\n\nWhat I mean to say is, this game, while trying to be a spiritual successor to the aforementioned titles, is nothing like them at all.  That is the most egregious error that it makes.  It does not flow smoothly.  The in-game UI is terribly unintuitive and needlessly departs from the successful UI that most all of the above games utilized.\n\nThat isn't to say that it doesn't make any other errors.  This game is bad enough that it doesn't warrant a real game review.  So, without going too in-depth, here are some of the more annoying problems I found:\nBased on playing through a brief part of the game, the dialogue sessions cannot be skipped or sped up in any way, nor can you re-read the dilogue by scrolling up, nor can you access the main menu or even leave the game when in a dialogue session.  This means that you MUST act out a full dialogue whenever it comes up.  And the voice acting is poorly directed, feeling forced or just unnatural.  So it gets old.  Fast.\nThe game world is rendered in 3D, so as to allow you to rotate the camera whenever you want, zoom in, and zoom out.  This is a neat idea, but foolish.  A rotating camera is completely extraneous in an isometric RPG, which is what this game is trying to be.  And because the game world is rendered in 3D, you lose out on those wonderfully painted landscapes that the Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale games offered.  In their place we have polygons that look like parti-colored clay.  In short - the game world is ugly.\nThe camera follows your main character around in a fashion very similar to Diablo.  This means that, for the purposes of an isometric RPG, the camera is too close to allow for a good view of the battle, and just doesn't behave very well.  This makes it difficult to maneuver party members, try to place spells or other area-of-effect skills, or to simply get a good view of things going on.\nThe UI is unintuitive and feels a bit sloppy, and possibly unfinished.  Perhaps an executive came in and arbitrarily ordered a developer to "take away all those extra buttons! They clutter things up too much!"  There's no simple way to manipulate the party formation, nor adjust party AI on the fly.\nI would go into it a bit more, but frankly this game isn't worth the time spent typing, nor the time spent reading.  Don't waste your money, not even if you see it on sale.","December 18, 2015","false","0.6"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","13","23","3","0"

I have stopped preordering most games a long time ago, so I waited until release and what I heard and read simply was not good enough to make me buy SCL.\nSo the free weekend was a good opportunity to form an opinion of my own.\nIt was not a good start: a game on steam offering a free weekend and still requiring an extra account besides Steam?

Graphics ... well ... they are not that important to me (after all, I'm still playing Baldur's Gate 2 from time to time ... or Planescape Torment), but they certainly are not great.\n\n- Combat is atrocious in my opinion.

I'm coming up to the 10 hour play mark with the current release, and 20+ on pre-release, and can very safely say, this is a fantastic representation of what digital D&D can become, and they haven't even added any additional content yet!\n\nSingle player includes an exciting story line with more voiced dialogue than you can shake a stick at. That being said, online mode is where the real fantastic things happen.\n\nSo far I've played 8 online campaigns with dungeon masters, and they are so fantastic. DM's voice the entire story and provide background dialogue, challenges are intense, and it all can be scripted from scratch! Sometimes players get into it and roleplay too (Shout out to my main man Ser Balder of Waterdeep, we'll get you that coal mine, buddy). The way that this game has allowed people to let their imaginations run wild is truly number 1.\n\nNow to the nitty-gritty. The mechanics are much more advanced AD&D. Not only can your character focus on stats, but employ element attributes to stack as well. Not only that, but the spells are dazzling, and the combat tickers keep you planning. Well done, wizards.\n\nLastly, the content. The Sword Coast Legends team is developing constantly. They painstakingly took feedback for two months in pre-release, to bring something well done and fun to play. Imagine what's coming next from them.

As soon as you do that, you're inviting comparisons to the whole D&D enchilada and no matter how many times they say "based on D&D 5e" and capitalize or bold that "based on" part, there will be those who will nitpick about the parts of 5e that are not included... ultimately all those comparisons, fair or not, are on them for attaching themselves to that brand.\n\nSecond, the single player solo campaign part of SCL pales in comparison to other similar strategy RPG games from the past year that offer nothing but one campaign (D:OS, Eternity, Wastelands 2) in the number of hours playable in that campaign. It's not meant to be looked at that way because the DM feature is the true meat of this game, you say? Well yes, but that's a fine distinction that will be lost on many casual Steam buyers who buy it for the SP campaign only or mostly.\n\nSome of us see the fun in running live DM modules with built-in voice chat and realize that this is the real core of this game. But IMO, we're the minority. Heck, there are tons of people wanting to compare SCL to Diablo as if this was an ARPG... no way many of those will ever be happy with this game.\n\nAll in all, I personally like this game and am enjoying playing it. Even so, I can't go higher than 6.5 with it although I'l give them the benefit of the release doubt and expect it to get better over time with more class and race additions and better DM tools as time goes on.","October 24, 2015","true","22.8"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","14","25","3","0"

I've been a DnD fan for a long time. I remember they hype of ADnD, I remember the 3rd edition, I remember such gems as BG1, IWD1 and NWN1. I spent days playing and modding and dungeon-running and dungeon-master-ing(?). I've seen how the whole Toril and the settings of the world would change over time.\n\nThis game? This game rocks. Period.\n\nPlayer.\n\nYou create a character. Not too many class / race options for now (they're making updates and are introducing tieflings and more classes next week), but you got all the main-stream ones. I went for ye ol' golden dwarf cleric, since nothing says "A balanced" group, like a dedicated healer / buffer / resser all in-one (no, it doesn't work this way, but still).\nYou can do a campaign, both single-player or grabbing a friend/-s.\nYou can say "fk it, I'm bored" and go for a dungeon delve with random people into a random dungeon with random loot and quests.\nYou can say "fk-fk-fk this" and go play in a module or a player created campaign with other people to experience a different edge.\nAnd after all that you can return back to campaign with ALL YOUR XP AND STUFF from the recent adventures still with you! It's like they took the Diablo character system and made it... GOOD!\n\nDungeon master.\n\nTired of doing quests, running the dungeons, and just want to be the creator! Sure! Create your own modules with your own story and make people play it! Or better - be a dungeon master there, creating new stuff, characters, spawning monsters etc-etc. Take on a role of one of the NPCs and and lead the players on if you wish!\n\nOR join a dungeon delve as a dungeon master and do all the above ON THE GO! Create traps, locked doors to stop the adventurers, create armies to stop them from advancing OR if you got skills and imagination, make a whole quest there! Scatter some corpses, make a little girl NPC ask them for an escort, whatever! Be a helper or an evil genius - all up to you!\n\n---------------------------\n\nThis game is constantly evolving, devs adding new stuff, new tilesets, new options, new items. It's awesome!\n\nBUT BEWARE!!!\n\n5th edition differs A LOT from the previous ones. And even though this game does its best to follow it, some things are created by the devs (marvellously, though).

There are a ton to choose from with monsters and objects. More than enough to create some really cool campaigns. Also, everyone needs to realize that N-Space has said that they will be patching in other items as well as providing some DLC to expand the library.\n\nIn all this is a fun game to play with friends and I would suggest grabbing a copy.

When you let the community in and voice their opinion, which is what NS has done, you get a million opinions. That is a whole can of worms that I wouldn’t want to mess with.

SCL speeds things up with real time combat (which can be paused and even set to pause after each round).  Inspired by DnD 5e, but not a copy of it may make some people upset, but table top DnD (which I have played for years) is a table top game, not a video game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaneadamson/recommended/325600/","kaneadamson","Kane Adamson (Aron's Alt)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaneadamson/","4 products in account","Verdict: 7/10. Buy it now if you really want to play a D&D CRPG now. Otherwise, wait for a sale.\n\nSo I heard about this new game being developed called Sword Coast Legends, and it would be based on what was then called D&D Next (now known as D&D Fifth Edition, or D&D 5e). It would take place in the Sword Coast, a region of Faerun familiar to those who have played Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights. It was being made by some of the people who worked on the original Dragon Age: Origins, who I assumed were those who didn't sell their souls to Electronic Arts.\n\nOh, and they were asking for some rather silly prices for some of the pre-orders. Yes, they were offering pre-orders for a game that wasn't finished, based on an RPG that wasn't finished. Would it be a repeat of Neverwinter Online again? No thanks, but I'm keeping my money.\n\nOver the past year, every few months, I would check up on Sword Coast Legends' development. I read about the companions, then the few plot hints that were teased, and then I watched videos of the game, as well as Twitch VODs. It wasn't until around September 11, 2015 that I actually pre-ordered the game. In comparison, my SwordCoast.com account was registered on February 26, 2015, and that was only so I could ask questions about the game on the forums.\n\nEven then, I got it for $26.79 at a third-party site, which is close to what I might pay for it during a Steam Sale. Actually, I might've come out ahead, as I like the game, and I will be getting the Rage of Demons expansion for free.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Well-written, well-acted companions. None of them are walking stereotypes, and they are all multidimensional characters with hidden depths. I particularly like how none of the wizard companions are in it for the sake of knowledge/science/magic/Mystra/whatever, and actually adventure for more practical purposes. Of the many companions, the two wizards the only ones who talk like real people. Hommet sounds like a real person and not a fictional fantasy character. Soronil talks in a more dramatic fashion compared to Hommet, but is the closest to how a real person talks (there's that hint of of tiredness and slight lack of seriousness in Soronil's voice that makes him seem more real).\n\n2. A lot of the combat can be bypassed through stealth or diplomacy or money or even through previous gameplay choices. Surprisingly, combat takes up a shorter amount of time compared to exploration and social interaction in Story Mode. Then again, I tried to avoid combat as much as possible. It's refreshing to see thugs let you pass when you pay their toll instead of trying to rob you anyway.\n\n3. No filler. Do you hate games where most of your time is spent fighting irrelevant monsters in a dungeon that never seems to end? In that case, SCL is for you. When an NPC told me that I would be teleporting to the final area, I expected a large megadungeon with multiple levels and countless monsters. Instead, I get teleported to the final boss and his minons immediately and then we fight after a rather short pre-fight trash talk.\n\n4. No forced companions. While the Story Mode workaround for mandatory companions feels cheesy, the item does exist in D&D, specifically in the Eberron Campaign Setting. You can choose the party that you want without missing any mandatory dialogue.\n\n5. Each ability score is used in dialogue. There is no god stat like Charisma because the other stats also come into play. In fact, Charisma sometimes gives a lesser reward compared to the Intelligence or the Wisdom option, as being persuasive doesn't always replace knowledge or experience in real life.\n\n6. There are a lot of references to D&D lore, especiall Forgotten Realms lore. Lore buffs who can get past the game's arcade-like combat will love all the overt and subtle lore references.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Lost all of my achievements during the Headstart. I had all of the companion achievements as well as numerous campaign achievements. The only ones I didn't get (other than the Dungeon Crawl and Dungeon Master achievements) were the one where you maxed out in one class, maxed out in all classes, and finished the game with every race and class.\n\n2. Performance is choppy in many areas. Also, for some reason, Shadowplay's FPS counter doesn't show up in Sword Coast Legends. I can feel how low my FPS is, but I can't tell because the FPS counter doesn't show up. I might have to use the Steam FPS counter, though.\n\n3. There are several stability issues. During my first run through Story Mode, I crashed around 5 times. That's really not bad compared to some other games out there, but I'd prefer no crashes instead.\n\n4. DM tools are extremely limited compared to whatever tools were made to create Story Mode. The DM tools and the DM client let you play Diablo-lite with a DM. There is no dialogue editor in the DM tools, and you are limited to "We accept!" and "Not right now." This is quite jarring after having played Story Mode since it gives you so much more freedom and so much more dialogue options.\n\n5. This is a D&D game, which means it carries all the baggage that comes with the name. D&D means different things to different people, and you will find yourself with some very unreasonable people who absolutely hate the game. Don't get me wrong, there are a few fanboys running around, but the haters are much more persistent and annoying.\n\n6. The vast majority of powers are crap. The only ones that matters are buffs, passives, and crowd control. The brunt of your damage will be from basic attacks, as the attack powers don't deal a lot of damage but have extremely long cooldowns. As a rule, don't get pure damage powers unless they're a prerequisite to a buff, passive, or crowd control. By the end of the game, a fighter with four basic attacks per round will outdamage any power in the game.\n\n7. There are few bugs, but the ones that you notice will be very jarring. The most prominent one is where autoleveling turns off once Soronil joins the party. Previously, I could mix and match party members because they would all be brought up to my main character's level. After Soronil joined, I was locked into a specific party because the other companions were so underleveled by the time I noticed.\n\n8. Sound balance is bad. It's not that they're unpleasant, as the sound effects, the voice acting, and the music are all wonderful; it's just that they're not well balanced and something can be too loud or too soft. The character command acknowledgements can be annoying, as they play with each order given by default. Try setting it to around 10% to 25% so they don't spam their acknowledgements when you're micromanaging a fight.","October 20, 2015","true","4.2"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","17","31","0","0"

If you enjoyed Baldur's Gate and/or NWN you'll probably enjoy this. Buy it!\n●▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬●\n×°×★Detailed Review★×°×\n\nFirst off, I want to address all the negative reviews as it may be a bit misleading to those of you on the fence, wondering if you should buy SCL or not. I've read a LOT of these negative reviews and most of them are full of misinformation. This is due to a few things: Either they didn't play long enough to realize that the features they wanted actually do exist, they were unaware that the Developers have promised these features to be released in future updates, or had unrealistic expectations of the game. Any review that says SCL is a "diablo clone" should be ignored. They don't know what they're talking about.\n\nYes, the module making is currently lacking in features, that's true. That being said, I've played some outstanding player made campaigns with incredible roleplaying aspects to it. It's all because of their imaginations. They used their experience with tabletop D&D to fuel the stories for their campaigns and I, the player, was totally immersed into it. It is unrealistic to expect a computer to be able to predict everything a player is going to do. That's why you need a human being in the role of a DM. It's not the system's fault that your module sucks, it's your lack of imagination and dedication.\n\nBugs and system errors are already being worked on by the developers. They are listening to the player's feedback and have an honest desire to shape this game into something we all enjoy. For a small team of people, their effort has restored my faith in game developers. They're actively responding to forums, addressing bugs, and working to improve upon existing game mechanics. You wanted Necromancy? It's coming soon. You wanted mod support? Released in December. You want more classes? They're working on it. Seriously, there are so many developers out there making millions, if not billions of dollars who don't give a flying fsck about you as a player. That's not the case with these guys. They deserve some time and patience to prove themselves.\n\nThe Story mode campaign can be played single player or co-op, which is great! I love co-op in any game. And with a 30hr+ main questline you'll get your money's worth even if that's all you do. And there's loads of side quests to keep you 100%-ers busy for a while. It's a compelling storyline with interesting characters. I have a pretty low tolerance for sh*tty plots, so if I could play it all the way through it's gotta be worth something!\n\nThe gameplay is fun and easy to get into, especially for veterans of Baldur's Gate. Now, it's not dyed-in-the-wool D&D ruleset, abilities are cooldown based instead of uses per day, and as an avid Wizard player, it's nice to be able to blast away without worrying about blowing my load too early in a fight. All the basics are there, Wizards nuke or crowd control, Fighters are badasses in platemail, Rogues explode monsters with epic sneak attacks, and Clerics are still the gods of healing power. There are four (4) members to your party; in singleplayer mode the other three (3) can be chosen from an ever expanding roster of characters which you encounter throughout your journey. You can choose their abilities as they level up, and you can even take them with you on Dungeon Crawls or player made modules. All in all a solid design.\n\nThe toolset for module making is lacking in its current state and nowhere near the variety that Neverwinter Nights had; however, the Developers have already acknowledged this and are working to improve it. But as I've said before, this lack of functionality can be overcome with some imagination and dedication.\n\nIn the end, whether this game is good or not is up to you. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and my opinion is that this is a really fun game and totally worth the buy.

Yes, but its a virtual game, based on a very loose system intended to be less restrictive\n\nAlso, there is no mention to dice rolls whatsoever, which may be considered "offgame" to some; and I havent seen "save rolls" so far (but those must be hidden, like the supposed dice rolls)\n\nI am yet to try the coop gameplay, as I am one of the "against the tide" people, and noone of my immediate circle followed me so far.\nBut the Dungeon Crawl mode (random generated dungeon with some specifics, like types of mobs, number of floors and quest per floor) is very well designed as well, since it allows you to keep the fun going without having to replay something you already did.\n\nThere are also side quests that you can (freely) download, created by other players on the aforementioned DM feature, which may come with a surprisingly new quest for you.\n\ntl;dr\nGame is good, slightly divergent and lacking in options (so far) when related to PnP, people are raging because it's not Baldur's Gate revamped\n\nP.S.: People who complain this is not D&D 5e should read the 5e rulebook, and also remember that the game is just out, and that it's a digital game, which has a different gameplay than PnP itself","October 23, 2015","true","1.3"," 41 of 78 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","41","78","5","0"

I understand that for some,especially those who like hardcore RPGs, why It might be a dissapointment for them.

Things I am sure they will fix in future updates,but if they don't,it really wont matter.\n\nIt seems that the reason some don't like it is because it doesn't comply with a certain set of D@D rules,and I believe them,but for someone like me who has not played any D@D since my table top Middle Earth days a million years ago and the almost total lack of memory when it comes to how it all worked....to my mind so far,it plays really well.\n\nThis is the first time in a long time that I can say I have played a game for 5 hours straight,(the last was Baldur's Gate I believe,and appart from the fact that I loved that game I can't remember the "ruleset" I just remember how hooked I was) hardly progressed through the game so far,but loved every little bit of it.\n\nI think this is the first time I have written a review on steam.

Those were absolute classics, based on D&D rulesets but not exact transpositions of P&P D&D. So is this game.\n\nSingle Player:\nI know many will disagree with me but this game's atmosphere, music and combat is actually very D&D like, not really too much like a Diablo style ARPG. The story reminded me much about Neverwinter Nights with its locations and factions, the combat is very Icewind Dale like in which it is based on perfectly gearing and building your party up to the point its an unstoppable killing machine, the characters (party companions and NPCs) resemble a bit of Baldur's Gate in which they voice opinions, give quests and personality (some of your party members may dislike other party members for example, and they do make it very apparent, although they never leave the party like in BG).\n\nMultiplayer:\nI love Dungeon Crawl, the loot, the fights, the progression, the exploration inducing quests. Its fun alone or with a party of friends, but it really shines when you get a DM, its like your own undiscovered adventure and playing with someone you cant predict is the most fun and challenging any D&D videogame has ever been for me.\nCant say I have played a great deal of Modules, but the ones I did play (were recommended to me) are fantastic. This is the place where this game was meant to shine. From well written (player and D&D fan written) stories, to complex battles which can spike in difficulty when playing with a DM, Modules offer something for everyone and Im even considering building some myself (if I find the time, jobs take a lot of it).\n\nNegative:\nPeople complain about the lack of features, and they have to, there is still a lot missing. There is also the problem of stacking item effects, wich can make even a pathetically built character a single player powerhouse.\nThat being said, the game is still being updated and will recieve DLCs later on, which (like in Neverwinter Nights expansions) will open up the game much more and introduce more options to all players (adventurers and DM).\n\nAll in all:\nThis game is definetly worth its price, if N-Space solves the stacking issue it will even shine among other great D&D videogames of the past. I wholeheartedly recommend this.","October 28, 2015","true","22.2"," 22 of 41 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","22","41","2","0"

First of all, i am a bit biased, since i crave Roleplaying games of all kinds and generally view them favorably just for being RPG.\n\nAlso, i am a seasoned Pen and Paper RPG Veteran with more than 35 years of experience as Player and DM.\n\nMy oppinion of this game is mixed, and here is why:\n\nFirst of all, it is a decent, wellmade RPG, with slightly dated graphics, a simplified module editor and a 'random dungeon generator' that allows nearly endless replayability.\n\nIt has a well thought out multiplayer component that is fun to play and very enjoyable.\n\nThe campaign is very well written as far as i played it, and it reminds me a lot of classic NWN1 and NWN2 campaigns.\n\nIf my review would end here the game would recieve a very high score, somewhere between 8/9 out of 10.\n\nBUT, and here is what many people criticize, and what also makes my rating go down quite a bit:\nThe game is not what it says it would be. It is not, as it says, and not even CLOSE to being a 5E adaptation. It is indeed a game that plays in the Forgotten Realms and uses the well known Attribute scores, races (not all of them) and classes (not all of them) we all know and love from D&D. This is already where it ends. It has no advanced and/or prestige classes, no skill system whatsoever, it does not at all use the magic system and instead is based upon a skilltree. There is no resting in any form, and no crafting.\n\nAnother point going against it is the very limited editor. While it works great in creating random dungeons, that is also its greatest flaw. It is not an editor per se, it only generates random dungeons which you then can modify. No building dungeons or maps step by step.\n\n\nConclusion:\nSCL is a very enjoyable game with a great campaign.\n\nIt is NOT in any way shape or form, a 5E D&D adaptation.\n\nStill, if you forget what this game is supposed to be, and take it for what it is, you will enjoy it.\n\nOn a base of 1 to 10 i give this game a 7.","October 20, 2015","true","4.8"," 48 of 92 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","48","92","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bogganowski/recommended/325600/","bogganowski","BoGG","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bogganowski/","2108 products in account","First off I got this game without crazy expectations, it looked good and did remind me of games like Baldur's Gate or any other D&D game that came out some years ago. Now I see tons of reviews from people complaining that it isn't what was promised and doesn't meet their expectations, honestly I'm not sure what they were expecting because in my case I liked what I received.\n\nSword Coast Legends isn't a pure D&D game sticking to the rules of the table game, it's more arcadish and has a character building system that works with skill trees like you would find in Hack and Slash games like Diablo.\n\nThe Graphics are not stellar but do look good and offer a good camera control all around, zoom in-out and full 3d rotation with free cam that can be set on the character or just wandering around the map. There are a few glitches that I could notice like capes going thru the character models but other than that it's pretty well done and has nice Eye Candy effects for things like Flaming Swords and Spells. The Fighting system is pretty simple, you choose who or what to attack and select skills as you go and the rest of the party does the same on it's own with a decent AI. It's also possible to control every party character actions and pause to select each action but I personally went with the Hack and Slash style of playing.\n\nThe Story is great, I'm not that far into the game but I'm intrigued to know more and discover how the whole scenario develops. Side quests are easy to keep track on since they show on the side of the screen and update on the fly with each step you take on them.\n\nAs for Audio I like the Music and the Voice-Acting is pretty well done, it doesn't offer that many different voice options for your own characters but it ain't that bad. One thing that can be annoying is your character replying to every move command you give to it, not sure that was necessary.\n\nI think the end result could be better, but as it just came out I have hope that the Devs will keep working on it and make it better with time. They say more classes and races will be brought into the game but what is not said is if those will be directly included in the game or if we'll have to purchase DLCs for them. One thing is certain this game will have some content DLCs coming our way later on, it needs them to stay alive.\n\nI didn't use the Dungeon Master part of the game, I mainly played it as a single-player so far, but I like the idea that I could play it with friends and a DM controlling the action. I'm not gonna say much more about that since I didn't really experience it but one thing is.. I would have liked the game to have some SteamWorks integration so that Adventures created by other users could be shared easily thru it.\n\nThe game could be better but it does offer plenty of nice Questing hours for the price tag it's offered under. I would describe it as a "Baldur's Gate" meets "Diablo" kind of game. Hopefully it will only get better in time, but as of now I already consider it's worth the price asked for it and is an easy grab if it ever hits a 50%+ sale.\n\nOverall I would give the game a 7/10 for now.","October 24, 2015","true","13.5"," 28 of 53 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","28","53","3","0"

There are a few options I haven't explored, DM, Co-Op, etc., but those really aren't my thing anyways. Graphically, it is pretty decent.

There's also a keen attention to detail; every piece of new armour you find and every weapon reflects on your character in game when equipped. As example I've just flushed out the Graveyard section of the first (and maybe only?) town you enter and came out with a Jack-O-Latern mask which I fit on my short and plump dwarven fighter as well a skeleton mask for the necromancer.\n\nIf you're an attention deficit completionist who slaps on every wall in a video game looking for hidden rooms then Sword Coast will keep you content for a long while.\n\nCurrently no DLC and I believe that is because there are many free downloadable mini expansion campaigns made both by the developers and end users.\n\nYou can level up in these side campaigns and then run back to the main story with your new loot if  having difficulties.\n\nI got SC for $25 from a recent sale.

Game drones on, never becomes interesting, player choices have zero to do with your alignment/background. Not in the spirit of D&D at all. It doesn't even follow the rulesset they promised. Nothing more than a clunky hack and slash. The DM portion is severely lacking - again, promised a lot - delivered about 25%.\nAs a D&D lover I was so excited for this game. And so completely disappointed.\nYou'd be better off with Neverwinter (online MMO) or even DDO.

I wouldnt spend more then $5-$10 on it if your looking to buy the game. I might enjoy it more if I paid less for it, ( i paid $20) but the game vs the cost just dont seem to be worth it.\n\nothers might like it,\n\nIt lacks alot of my favorite classes from D&D, and there is no utility to the classes.\nthe quests are linear. for example the quest to save or kill the dog at the beggining of the game. I didnt even have a chane to save the dog because my stats where not high enough to succeed the conversation. in D&D even if i have  ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stats, i could still roll high and succeed. this game has no rolls, just hard break points on your stats to determine success. that is lame to me. I decided to just leave the dog alive, then later i found out the caravan leader just came over and killed the dog anyway. I should have just been able to kill the halfling that was accusing the dog, and make up some lie obout how he was some evil hobit that had something against dogs.\n\nI cant pickpocket the vendors if i want to. or i feel there should be the freedom to just kill the vendors and take their stuff. (obviously the vendors would fight back or be hard to kill but the option should be there.\n\nthe draw of D&D is to play the game the way you want to and face the consequences of your actions if you decide to play more evil ( or if your good get away with it). this just dosent exist in this game.\n\nTLDR = No freedom of choice in the game = not D&D","February 20","true","4.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I will buy it,\n\nThe game is great to play, it feels like a half Balur's Gate/Neverwinters Night and half Table top Dungeons and Dragons game. The solo story is good brings back memories of old DnD games. Below i will list some pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n- Good Initial story to get you into the the gameplay.\n- Great character customization system.\n- Voice acting is about average for what you would expect other than a couple lines here and there.\n- Very DnD feel with interacting with object in the main story such as bashing vines but not having enough strength.\n- In depth DM tools, still need some work but great for creating fast campaigns for new players.\n\nCons\n- Single player combat can be a bit janky due to the multiplayer focus the and the AI not being able to be tweaked to use some spells over others. (Considering my first experience with the game revolved around multiplayer this was not unexpected.)\n- Setting up of your Skill bar is very clunky, it will auto-populate with everyting from scolls to potions and removing the objects from your bar will cause your character to use it instead of just removing it from the bar. (This could be easily fixed by adding a lock option..)\n- Characters will run to an enemy over casting the spell causing you to have to issue a move command each time before casting if using a melee weapon.\n\n\nOverall for being a new attempt at an idea I'd say its a solid 7.5/10 with some improvements the game could be fantastic i would recommend.\n\nSome final notes I would suggest if you buy the game to play with a group to get the full expirience of the game and what it was mean't for i understand the negative reviews but after hearing the dev's talk at PAX i pretty much knew what to expect and i feel they nailed that pretty well.","December 21, 2015","true","16.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

Ideally this should be played with a friend as the idea of the game is to mimic the socialness of a D&D game, the module creator and DM mode being the prime examples.\n\nCharacter creation is fun and although it feels there is a lack of classes, it is easy to make an interesting character with plenty of ability trees to pick from so you can specialise or pick and choose. Some complain about the abilities being on a cooldown, but I feel as though this lends itself to the game well as you still need to pick a good time to use them, not every encounter requires their use and, importantly, it keeps the flow of the game going. There are many interesting weapons and armour in the game which can suit many playstyles so whatever weapons you prefer there will always be some of those.\n\nThe story is nothing impressive as it follows a typical-ish D&D plot. There are plenty of quests to do, though some of which can be difficult to follow. The voice acting is good but no characters really make an impression but all companions have a fairly fleshed out backstory, each with their own quest to compliment it. The dungeons are well planned, with a few puzzles and plenty of secrets and traps. Overall, dungeon crawling is the strong point of the game and hacking and slashing through them is great with a friend.","October 27, 2015","true","22.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It's got familiar looking mechanics and ability names, but the 'inspired' in their claim that the game is inpsired by 5th ed D&D is very much the operative word.\n\nOnce you get past that what you've got is a brawler that is fast-paced, easy to digest and with the option of cranking the difficulty right up. Pure win, if you ask me. The campaigns I've sampled seem pretty good and range from 'dungeon crawl plus' to 'book in game form,' so lots of variety.\n\nThe extra tileset in the deluxe content is pretty cool, but I'm not sure that it justifies the money.

We intended to play the story mode together in co-op.\n\nThe user interface is poorly designed and buggy.  The entire process of starting the game & signing up was far too convoluted and when I actually did get to play the game I found I was unable to invite my wife to the game.\n\nI later discovered through an obscure redit post that you have to complete the first "mission" before you can invite others to your game.  Fair enough, but would be nice if the game actually told you that rather than simply disabling the invite button!\n\nOnce my wife and I did get into game together we found the way that conversation had been done to be incredibly jarring.  Having recently been playing Divinity: Original Sin the notion of having my game stop me from acting while I'm forced to watch/listen to dialogue that my wife is engaged in is ludicrous.  In divinity it gives you the option to listen in if you want to but doesn't stop you from going about other business while one player talks to some NPC's.\n\nTactical pause not being available in co-op is a terrible omission... especially for players who would be on voice chat or in the same room while co-op'ing.\n\nOverall I found the user interface/experience to be severely lacking and the story & game its self lackluster at best.  Feels more like an attampt to make some quick money than a serious attempt at a D&D game.","December 25, 2015","false","1.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I haven't played enough of the story to truly comment on it, though it seems interesting enough from what I've seen.\n\nWhere this game shines is in multiplayer, especially if you can get a full party of four. You no longer have to worry about the AI doing stupid things (rather, you worry your friends will do stupid things hahaha!), and it's just a blast running around killing oozes and whatnot. One complaint would be that the dialogue system is a bit of a pain in multiplayer; whenever someone initiates a conversation, it interrupts everyone else and forces them to watch the convo. I'd prefer if it worked more like Divinity: Original Sin, where the dialogue would just be in a box on the side of the screen so you can read it but still do your own thing.\n\nOther than that though, this game is really, really fun with friends, and I would recommend it to anyone who's looking to chill with their D&D party outside of actual D&D sessions.","February 8","true","35.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I wonder if a majority have even played through Sword Coast Legends as I have.  What gripes most as you will read is that although this game is based off Dungeon and Dragons, the games rules system is not.  This game plays more like a Dragon Age/Diablo than say a Temple of Elemental Evil (3.5 rule set).  This is my major dislike as well as I have with this game.  To not recommend this game though is a bit on the spoiled gamer era we live in.  Not to give this game a chance is a shame.  Now to the listing of my Pro's and Cons.  Keep in mind this is from the original campaign,  I haven't tinkered with the DM client, or Multiplayer to comment on it.\n\nPros: The Graphics are beautiful to behold from a top down game.   The soundtrack reminded me of Neverwinter Nights 1 & 2.  The voice acting was surprisingly good all around.  All characters were well thought out with a believeable backstory.  *My favorite was a certain insane derro you stumble upon!*\n\nThe Bad:  The Save games, you only have one save game, with another option of  "default" load which puts you at the beginning of a level(Possiblity of Hours of Lost Progress!).   Monster Difficulty, Don't be too despaired by the one save game option due to the fact that you rarely get the Total Party Kill in this game on normal difficulty or below. Rulesets. PLEASE!!!  If I wanted to play Dragon Age, or Diablo I would buy those games.  If I buy a Dungeon and Dragon game I want a Dungeon and Dragons RULE SET.\n\nFinal Thoughts:   Take the other negative reviews with a grain of salt, this game is not buggy and runs well.  Yes the rule set component of this game severely drags it down for me and others but not to the point where I would not recommend it.  Come for the Story, come for the opportunity to play in Faerun and make memories like you did with Baldur's Gate and, Neverwinter Nights.","November 3, 2015","true","54.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

I for one liked the way you had to pick and choose what spells you could use and then ration them during a battle. Resting to restore spells and then figuring what skills to choose  as I leveled. This seems like a watered down system making it easier to get into for those intimidated by the lore and the number 5. My thief died way too often (NPC) and character seemed to waste spells before I had a chance to choose what they would do. A little too easy, guess have to fiddle with the AI. So with the minuses I still can say it's an enjoyable game. Sure I expected more, but that's easy to get over. Decent story and interesting characters (nice voices). So I might just pick it up after the weekend is over, not like I don't have enough games already.","December 18, 2015","true","3.7"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

I can see why hardcore D&D players would have issue with the game as it's not quite the D&D experience many were expecting and there are a lot of dumbed down aspects when compared to Neverwinter Nights, but all things considered for non-D&D players, this is a very nice and well designed game.\n\nDevelopers have also been taking into consideration the criticism and have been actively working on things that people have been complaining about.

From my exploring it, here's the downside- the editor is feature limited.  It would be nice to be able to give specific/custom items and use them to drive quests, and also to be able to do some minor story branching based on actions/decisions of the players, but at this point you can't (at least I haven't figured out where/how).  But here's where I believe the editor really excells-  Once you learn how it works, it does an amazing job in my opinion of producing a basic stage upon which to write an adventure.  It automates things that can be very time consuming and tedius, to the point I fatigued/timed out in editors like Neverwinter's before I ever got very far.  Sword Coast Legends' editor automatically generates environments and sets encouters in them, including placing a boss in the last room of a dungeon if you so choose.  Putting together basic quests is also incredibly simple as it automates 90% of the work in a "go kill this" "go collect these" or "kill the boss" quest.  And you can tweak things from there.  While the editor has only a fraction of the feautres of Neverwinters, it can (at least by my estimates) produce a basic game world in about 5% of the time.  And while D&D purists probably scorn it's simplicity- for the hardcore, a live dungeon master can do things an editor never could.\n\nBottom line- I'm happy to support these guys, and hope they continue to develope its capabilities.

Usually this type of gameplay just isn't all that very fun to me. Sword Coast Legends has a great story to play if you are alone and want a nice world to explore. It get way more fun when a few friends jump on. Friends can join your story mode, or you can choose from many different random dungeons quickly in a dungeon crawl mode with many different options to choose from. There's always the user created modules, which have the ability to be as big or bigger than the games own story mode. While playing with friends (or randoms) you can choose to play with a Dungeon Master. This brings a whole bunch more into the game, as you have a live person controlling the AI and story in real time. This is by far my favorite LAN party game of 2015.

I am convinced that no matter how good it was at release, it was destined to be panned by its audience.\n\nIf you are coming into this expecting Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter Nights, you will probably be disappointed.  And that's a damn shame, because Sword Coast Legends is a great game -- it's just not in the same genre as those old classics.  It most strongly resembles Bioware's Dragon Age, only with a camera locked in isometric view and no programmable AI.\n\nAs someone who could never get into Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter Nights (or Dragon Age, for that matter), Sword Coast Legends is a perfect fit for me.  Yes, it is a lot more casual.  Yes, the D&D rules are heavily abstracted.  But when I'm barreling through the procedurally generated Dungeon Crawl mode with friends, it feels good.  It feels like playing D&D, which is always my most important litmus test for the success of one of these games.  The rules don't matter to me.  What matters is the experience, and for my money the D&D experience of Sword Coast Legends is excellent.\n\nThe game is not perfect.  It is a ten-year-old experience at least.  The graphics are attractive but not cutting edge, and the UI is uninspired.  The Dungeon Master toolset is casual, like the player experience, and this renders it useless for anything but the most simple linear stories.  That said, the developers have pushed a number of free patches since release that have made great improvements.\n\nThe potential for monetization of this title through microtransactions is obvious, and it will live or die based on how smart the publisher is about when they begin to implement paid DLC.  But right now, as far as I am concerned, the co-op campaign and Dungeon Crawl mode alone are worth the price of admission, hands down.\n\nIf you are a fan of the old isometric pause-and-play D&D games, I encourage you to approach Sword Coast Legends with an open mind and try to enjoy it as its own animal.  It is very different than those classic titles, but it is not necessarily a less fun experience.","December 24, 2015","true","49.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

It is D&D but modified. As a Neverwinter Night and cRPG fan,I had low expectations (from past experience with other games) but really love the game.\n\nSome people have strict D&D expectations, and don't like it. Some are warming up to it.\n\nEntertainment Value - 5 Stars\n\nNOTE: This covers the single-player campaign and not DM mode.\n\nHere is a list of things I comprised: (Not in order of importance)\n\n1. Dungeon crawls are fun. Combat is just the right amount for those whom\ndon't want constant or grueling combat.\n\n2. Trap detection actually works. Rogue skills/abilities are useful.\n3. The laughs. (see below)\n4. Abilities are just about right, requiring some managing and planning but not micromanaging trash mobs.\n5. Smooth performance - Some have had issues, I haven't had any.\n6. The story, I'm liking a lot so far (half-way point now)\n7. The quests are at least average or better.\n8. Voice work is decent. (correction) very good.\n9. Companion comments.\n10. Companion AI (and ability to turn it off)\n11. The sound effects. (except when the summoned creature disappears/'dies"-- poor thing)\n12. Graphics are fitting and nicely done, also fit the mood of the game.\n13. Combat is fun and not a chore, but not so easy to let it run on auto-pilot.\n14. 360 degree view -- newer games in this genre don't always have this.\n15. The loot descriptions.\n16. Hunting/exploring to meet some objectives.\n17. Being Waylaid!\n18. Music is very nice - subdued but fitting and top notch.\n19. Challenging mini-boss fights that do require more pausing and tactics.\n\nThe laughs -- things like getting my 20 STR character charmed and killing off the rest of my party, certain side quests, the sound of vampires dying -- reminds me of the doppelgangers in Baldur's Gate. (okay, so I amuse easily at times).\n\nThe main things I'd change (so far):\n\n1. Screen-edge scrolling / camera follow (has been added partially (edge nudge), WSAD walk to come)\n2. Formations -- adding them.\n3. Anything else would be personal preference mostly, not necessary.\n\nHave better games been made? Sure. But for me, this is the most fun I've had this year with one.","October 19, 2015","true","143.0"," 37 of 71 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","37","71","0","5"

It is not at all like those games but that doesn't mean it isn't very fun. With a good DM this game can be loads of fun for a party of up to 5 people (including the DM) and while the module creator could use some work it allows a lot of creativity and most of my play time has probably been spent in that creating my Summer's Fall module.\n\nThey have recently announced a number of planned free updates that will really bring life into this game like mod support and more objects and abilities so expect it to get a lot better by the end of the year. Also if anyone claims that it sucks because they promised it would be like Neverwinter Nights with the dungeon master mode don't listen to them as nowhere did anyone promise that it would be like Neverwinter. In fact I'm actually glad that it isnt because this is far easier to use and therefore more inviting towards new players.\n\nBest bet to really enjoy this game is to think of it not as a D&D game but merely as a fun game within D&D's forgotten realms setting.","November 1, 2015","true","5.2"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Bottom-line: In my opinion if you liked playing games like Neverwinter, Pillars of Eternity, Dragon Age Origins you most likely will enjoy playing this game as well.

In general I would recommend this game but with an explanation.\n\nIf you are looking for Icewind Dale 3, Baldurs Gate 3, or similar you will probably be disappointed.  This game shares some similarities with those games and its clearly inspired by them but its been about 15 years since those games came out and things have changed.\n\nThe good, it feels like a game made 10+ years ago in the best ways.  It has difficulty, it doesn't hold your hand, it has a nice "classic" feel to it in general.  It uses some nice modern additions like saving character data to a server, easily making multiplayer games, having an easy means to create, share, and download player made adventures or "modules".   To a large degree its the merging of great old games with modern new features.\n\nThe bad, if you wanted/expected a more direct adaptation of D&D rules you will be let down.  All abilities have cooldowns and that is their limiting factor this means you can't have a wizard fire off 2-3 fireballs in a big battle, but it also means that wizard isn't going to be useless for the next "day" since he blew his spell load.  This also makes cooldown reduction rings, necklaces, etc VERY important.  Their is a real gear grind going on here about the best way to describe this game in a "negative light" is "Modernized Baldurs Gate infused with Diablo style loot" it still has +1, +2, etc weapons and gear but many of them also have effects too none of it is that "out there" with the exception of action speed and cooldown reduction both of which are VERY strong stats.\n\nThe ugly...  This game is not the prettiest out there.  If you are looking for advanced super HD graphics to make an ultra detailed dwarf cleric witht he most awesome beard, yeah you will be let down.  Graphically it looks something like an upgraded NeverWinter Nights 2 of sorts.  Its not "bad" but its just something to note.\n\nSo why do I recommend this game?  Its oldschool in a good way, yet still incorporates modern features to make it more multiplayer friendly and has real potential to go lots of places with additional updates.  If you really wanted Baldurs Gate 3, this is going to disappoint you if you just wanted a classic style D&D game with some nice modern additions this game is probably just for you.","November 1, 2015","true","14.5"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Good for you! There is a lot of hate aimed at this game. I have only one personal neg: the first five minutes were not enjoyable, that being the tutorial dream sequence of the campaign with silly blurry effects whilst I was trying to find my feet. But then that nightmare ended, and all became coherent. The campaign is a little trite, but then the campaign is not the strong point of this game.\n\nOne of the main complaints aimed at this product is that it isn't true to D&D, nor can it compare to the tilset power of NWN. The thing is, if you want to play a game faithful to D&D, rules and all, just go play D&D. We already have D&D. Five editions of it, seriously: use Roll 20 or invite your mates over and have a game at the table. That's as D&D faithful as you're going to get! Want NWN with better graphics, fine, this isn't it, but this isn't a cheese burger either, and all the cheese burger lovers aren't on the forums ranting like drunk harpies.\n\nHaving said that, let's move on to the positives. If you like D&D, and you enjoy the Forgotten Realms setting, and you like a good dungeon crawl or narrative with a distinct D&D flavour, you will likley enjoy this game for what it is: D&D tropes with some lightweight dungeon design tools.\n\nThe free weekend gave me a chance to try this game for myself after reviews disuaded me from purchase prior to now; I now own the game. I particularly enjoy the elegant dungeon crawl generator, where one may stack level after random level and drop their character into the gloom. Looking forward to more content for this game as I currently explore the Module design tools - lightweight but fun and accessable thus far like the previously mentioned random dungeon crawls. Sword Coast Legends is fun and accessable and worth a look. Going by the forums, you've got a 50% chance of being charmed and a 50% chance of turning into a drunk harpy.

It is D&D but modified. As a Neverwinter Night and cRPG fan,I had low expectations (from past experience with other games) but really love the game.\n\nSome people have strict D&D expectations, and don't like it. Some are warming up to it.\n\nEntertainment Value - 5 Stars\n\nNOTE: This covers the single-player campaign and not DM mode.\n\nHere is a list of things I comprised: (Not in order of importance)\n\n1. Dungeon crawls are fun. Combat is just the right amount for those whom\ndon't want constant or grueling combat.\n\n2. Trap detection actually works. Rogue skills/abilities are useful.\n3. The laughs. (see below)\n4. Abilities are just about right, requiring some managing and planning but not micromanaging trash mobs.\n5. Smooth performance - Some have had issues, I haven't had any.\n6. The story, I'm liking a lot so far (half-way point now)\n7. The quests are at least average or better.\n8. Voice work is decent. (correction) very good.\n9. Companion comments.\n10. Companion AI (and ability to turn it off)\n11. The sound effects. (except when the summoned creature disappears/'dies"-- poor thing)\n12. Graphics are fitting and nicely done, also fit the mood of the game.\n13. Combat is fun and not a chore, but not so easy to let it run on auto-pilot.\n14. 360 degree view -- newer games in this genre don't always have this.\n15. The loot descriptions.\n16. Hunting/exploring to meet some objectives.\n17. Being Waylaid!\n18. Music is very nice - subdued but fitting and top notch.\n19. Challenging mini-boss fights that do require more pausing and tactics.\n\nThe laughs -- things like getting my 20 STR character charmed and killing off the rest of my party, certain side quests, the sound of vampires dying -- reminds me of the doppelgangers in Baldur's Gate. (okay, so I amuse easily at times).\n\nThe main things I'd change (so far):\n\n1. Screen-edge scrolling / camera follow (has been added partially (edge nudge), WSAD walk to come)\n2. Formations -- adding them.\n3. Anything else would be personal preference mostly, not necessary.\n\nHave better games been made? Sure.

The principal problem with SCL is that it isn't finished in a fashion that we expected it to be.  The game plays a bit like Diablo and other ARPGs, but lacks due to the combat rounds which don't allow the characters to spam abilities or allow turned-based combat, which it desperately wants to be.\n\nLittle things like the inability to trade items among party members are maddening.  Sure, the solution is to drop things on the ground and pick them up, but this is a lack of foresight on the part of the developer that is astounding.  There seems to be a random assignment of loot that we still haven't been able to figure out.  It took us aver two hours to realize that there were options to disallow the auto-add to task bar, mostly because options seemed broken - if fact you change options before even entering the lobby.\n\nI wanted to create a custom campaign, complete with an urban hub right from the start.  Yeah, that won't happen for a while.  When our full party of four has a player drop due to a disconnect we are forced to temporarily adopt an NPC and then save and exit.  This is extremely clunky for a 2015 game.  Further, as the host I have had a few instances where we do this gyration only for the client to freeze, which needs a Task Manager purge of the client.  Others have complained about frame rates, clipping, tearing, etc.  I can accept slightly off graphics - our players are in three states and two different countries - for a slick multi-player interface and execution.  This game fails at both.","November 17, 2015","false","11.5"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

I'm a Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale, Temple of Elemental Evil fan and playas a single player.\n\nI'll not lie, this game won't set your world on fire. I'd rank it somewhere above Temple of Elemental Evil, but far below Icewind Dale (With the Baldurs Gate series way above all of them). It is better than Neverwinter Nights 1, but maybe somewhere in the same level of entertainment as Neverwinter Nights 2.\n\nAs I said, it won't set your world on fire. It lacks a certain drama or impetious,..... single player feels kind of "underwhelming" or blase' about all the proceedings. It is hard to articulate, but it lacks a certain " dramatic high adventure" feel to it and many of the side quests are very bland.\n\nSo the story writing and script lets it down a little. Probably the biggest disappointment for me.\n\nWith the exception of one or two characters,... almost everybody you meet is pretty forgettable with very little personality.\nEvery time I hear a certain party member speak I keep thinking of "Finchy" from the BBC Comedy "The Office" which is kind of immersion breaking.\nA certain young wizard is probably the best written and voice acted character, but stands tall above the sea of grey forgettable other personalities.\nThe Irish "Culchie" accents for Dwarfs work okay. I particulary like the choice of Dublin skanger for a dead rat gang member,... quite appropriate ;) . But much of the other voicework seems a little forgettable.\n\nGameplay wise, it works and I like the party AI in combat.\n\nGraphics are nice enough, functional, but nothing spectacular. Maybe a little more colour needed? Some dungeons do look great, with lots of little details, while other locations are just a little bland. Overall, not too bad, there are some clipping issues with cloaks etc, but I like the visual representation of weapons and armor etc.\n\nI know this all sounds very negative, but Sword Coast Legends has a certain charm, which is hard to define. I am enjoying it. I do actually like it. because it does work, the story is interesting enough to keep me playing and it does scratch a D&D itch,... if not entirely satisfactorily.\n\nThe big question is the games future;\nIt has great potential. Expansion packs, more (and definately better stories) would greatly improve this game. It feels as if it was not fully realised due to time/ budget constraints or simply below par writing.\n\nWith better writing, more personality injected into it and more drama, this could be a much much better game,... the raw materials are there. Maybe some patchs or expansion packs are what is needed to bring this game from the "average to good" pile into the "above average to great" pile.","November 8, 2015","true","36.6"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

There's a few reasons for this, but allow me to explain myself here: I'm not a D&D fan, but I don't have anything against it. That being said, the game still looked interesting, so I figured it would be worth a try. Sword Coast Legends isn't this god-awful atrocity that should be avoided altogether, but I couldn't bring myself to really enjoy this game, and I found it pretty boring for the most part.\n\nI would've given this game a neutral option if Steam had that with their reviews, but the negatives outweigh the positives here, so I had to go with the former as my opinion.\n\nGraphics\nThe visuals aren't actually all that bad in my opinion. The game looks pretty, and although I don't think it's on par with something like Divinity: Original Sin, it still looks pretty nice. It captures the mood, and that's really all I can say. This one of the few things about the game I can tolerate.\n\nGameplay\nThis is where my mixed opinion truly comes into play. On one hand, I am a fan of the character creator, and the game is simple enough to attract newcomers (like myself) to D&D, but the combat is so mind numbingly boring. I understand it's a CRPG, but at least Divinity: Original Sin, Pillars of Eternity, and all of those other games have combat that is actually somewhat entertaining. The ability cooldown is really long for everything, so the fights with some of the easiest enemies can drag out, and I've had trouble trying to stay up for the entire duration of a battle. To add on to this, the campaign is linear, and rather than having these interesting dialogue choices and quests, you're given what is basically a generic RPG that will lose your attention unless you're a huge fan of D&D. As said before, however, the character creator is pretty good, and that will probably satisfy fans. It's simple, as well, and this is also a mixed bag in its own right. Being that simple does attract the newbies like myself, and it might get you into D&D. On the other hand, it is too simple to satisfy the hardcore fans, this also affects the dungeon editor, which felt disappointing to someone like me, who loves trying to express my, ehm, "creativity."\n\nStory\nThere's not much to say here. If you're a D&D fan, you might enjoy it, but it felt bland from what I played. I couldn't bring myself to truly feel interested in any of the campaign, and the side quests are just as generic. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it isn't a good thing either.\n\nAudio\nThe audio is the same way, as it isn't bad. However, it's just as forgettable as the story, and really the entire game in general. Again, there isn't much to say for this category.\n\nReplayability\nI couldn't bring myself to play much more of this game as it is, I found it to be really boring. However, there are people who have logged well over 100 hours into the game, and you might end up doing the same. It really depends, though. If I managed to remain interested in this game for longer, I could've played at least 30 hours before giving up on it. Seeing as how this game has nothing innovative to it, I think you won't remember this game after 2 months of playing it.\n\nVerdict\nAgain, Sword Coast Legends isn't a BAD game. It brings nothing new to the table, however, and it feels forgettable as a result. You might have fun, you might not. But this review is about my experience with the game, and I couldn't stay interested in it for very long. I would only recommend it to someone that is a casual D&D fan or if the game is discounted, as it has trouble appealing to the hardcore fans.\n\nGraphics - 8.0/10\nGameplay - 6.5/10\nStory - 6.0/10\nAudio - 6.0/10\nReplayability - 6.5/10\n\n.:5.7/10:.\n\n+Satisfactory graphics\n+Solid character editor\n+Simplistic for newbies\n\n-Linear campaign\n-Poor level editor\n-Boring combat\n-Lack of interesting quests","February 13","false","6.3"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

I greatly enjoy any rpg with character creation, so Sword Coast Legends initially felt like a natural fit. Unfortunately, upon playing it was the very opposite.\n\nI'll start with the worst of the worst and that's the camera, map, and interface itself. The mini-map is rather unhelpful, with just a bunch of purple dots hinting at *something* but no names or locales come up. Combine this with a rather rigid version of edge-scrolling and the busier locales over-cluttered with abandoned buildings and it just makes exploration feel more like a chore than an adventure. It doesn't exactly help when you've scrolled too far and can't even center the camera back on your party. Arrive in Luskan and you'll know what I mean.\n\nAny dialogue, from a minor NPC sentence to visiting a vendor, all stops the game into a 'cutscene'. The transition feels sloppy, especially in comparison with the likes of Baldur's Gate and Pillars of Eternity, where the transition was more fluid. It doesn't help that the game itself is very sluggish to begin with, making even minor sequences aggravating.\n\nThe combat, put bluntly, is boring. You basically find yourself mashing skills in hopes of the enemy finally dying. It doesn't help that there are no AI tactics to assign (defensive, healing, support, tank) and you either have to 'pause and play', hoping your party doesn't get wiped out by the time you make your next move, or watch as the AI spits out random skills that may or may not help. To be fair the AI DOES seem to pick up on your skillset, so if you have a Paladin with healing skills, sometimes the AI will use them when necessary. However, it's inconsistent.\n\nOn a more positive note, the music is excellent (as expected from Inon Zur). As is the character generation itself. The inclusion of subraces and details put into the models are pretty decent while backgrounds add more flavor. The concept of each class' trees and skillsets aren't too bad either. I would have liked to see your race/class matter, but most DnD PC/console games pay little to no attention to that, making it more for flavor (and stats) than anything else.\n\nThe party members and dialogue was actually pretty good. The party members really do have personality although their relationship to the main character does feel railroaded and a bit forced. I did like how they interacted with one another and actually acknowledged each other's existence, feeling more like a cohesive team. The storyline is pretty standard fare (you have nightmares, a big bad threatens all, etc...) so while it's nothing to really write home about it's not necessarily bad either. I did like how the party members felt relevant to the narrative rather than somehow being there for convenience. Sad;y, there is no party creation feature ala Temple of Elemental Evil and NWN2's Storm of Zehir expansion, which is kind of a standard for a good DnD game.\n\nOverall though the game feels incomplete. Way too many bugs and poor handling to really enjoy even the main campaign. While I think it's excellent the Rage of Demons DLC and tiefling/warlock classes were added on for free, the game itself really feels like it could use an overhaul. Which is sad too because I really wanted to like this game. I'm still willing to give it another chance should the game get some more work done on it, but as is I honestly cannot recommend it.\n\n\n\n","May 22","false","9.5"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

I am currenty still playing in the campaign on Act3 solo and have another character nearing Act2 thats been playing in co-op.\n(46 hrs at time of posting + some time on headstart version)\n\nAs featured, you have 6 classes (these are Fighter, Cleric, Rogue, Wizard plus Paladin and Ranger) and 5 Races (Human, Halfling, Elf, Dwarf, Half Elf & some subraces of these) to choose from.  It's using 5e rules adapted for a video game which has led to a skill tree system consisting of multiple tree's dictated by your chosen class, which all contain numerous abilities, passives and spells you can learn related to that tree's 'theme'.\n\nInstead of having uses and casts per rest period as in most previous d&d games for your abilities and spells (where you could pretty  much rest after each fight with little or no consequences) cooldowns have been added instead. These take a little getting used to, but if you spread your spending of skill points a little and/or take some cooldown reduction gear you can easily use a string of abilities in every encounter. I wouldn't say i prefer it this way, but it works well as an alternative method once you've adapted to it.\n\nI have found the campaign's main story and many sidequests (although perhaps on occasion a bit cliche or generic) to generally be fun and/or amusing and true to the FR lore.  The NPC's you have in your party are voiced and all have an interesting backstory and their own questlines you can get from speaking with them at camp.\n\nAs well as this campaign you do also have dungeon crawls and a DM toolset included -  i havent touched these very much as of yet as i prefer being a player to a DM but its extra content and it looks pretty easy to use.\n\nI have hosted one dungeon crawl as a DM for a friend of mine. I got to choose from some preset options for its overall layout and creation and then got to DM on the fly.  Modifying and adding, loot chests, obstacles, traps, encounters and even possess some creatures for direct control of them as she went through the dungeon.  For me, it was quite enjoyable and a decent 'bonus' on top of the campaign.\n\nBased on a fairly lengthy campaign with the crawls and DM stuff as extra's i would recommend this product and rate it overall at around 8/10.\n\nAlthough i have recommended this game it does seems to have recieved a lot of negativity from people because of what its not, which is a NWN3 with regards to the DM toolset provided.\nIf you have used the NWN toolset to design and create campaigns and adventures and are looking for that kind of detail and freedom in SCL and are more interested in that than the campaign experience as a player this perhaps isn't for you and you should read some of the negative reviews which detail it more.","October 24, 2015","true","74.0"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

I've been playing CRPGs since I was a kid, and LOVED all the D&D ones (Baldur's Gates, Icewind Dales) and grabbed this thinking it was part of the new golden age in CRPGs. I was expecting something like Pillars of Eternity, except even more true-to-BG than PoE becase..hey, D&D. Half-Elves and Paladins and Sword Coast. Awesome, right?..except this game falls short of the mark, in so many different ways. If you were expecting the new greatest PC RPG in the line of The Witcher or PoE, THIS IS NOT IT.\n\nTo sum up, this game is simplified, clunky, without any charm, and lacks interesting characters or choices. This plays more like a simple ARPG (and if you wanted an ARPG, there's way better ones)\n\nSpecific complaints:\n\nUnremarkable cast members - their voice acting is ATROCIOUS, and none of them seem interesting. For a party-based RPG, this is a must. and it doesn't have it.\nClunky UI -\nEvery time  you start and finish talking to an NPC, the screen takes about a second to fade to black. EVERY DIALOGUE. This gets extremely old, and serves no purpose because there's not even talking heads. It just zooms in a bit more - but there's no animated dialogue or models. It does this even for the voiceless NPCs. Completely unnecessary.\nPauses between conversation options - You'll selection an option, wait a moment, then hear the response..the pause is noticeable enough to be grating - not good for impatient gamers like myself. Simplified ARPG gameplay\nEvery skill is cooldown based. There is no rest mechanic in this game - there's no worry about conservation of your skills and resources in a dungeon. You just spam your skill when the cooldown is over. It almost feels like an MMO.\nNo heavy customization - each class has about 5-6 different skill trees, but there's no dabbling in multi class options which is one of the greatest things about D&D. A significant step back from Neverwinter nights and what D&D has to offer.\nThe classes feel bland and generic. In D&D your Wizards have the ability to summon monsters, polymorph enemies, shapeshift, pull out magical flaming swords...in this game, they pretty much just focus on blasting stuff (evocation school). Your Wizard feels like any other Ranged DPS. Graphics - The character models aren't great looking - I found it pretty damn hard to make an aesthetically pleasing character. But the environments look decent.\nThis game has no personality. It's generic, bland, uninteresting. I hate that I was so hyped up, and all I got was this.\n\nI will be returning this for a refund. Do not drop $40 on this game. Go play Pillars or Path of Exile or Divinity.\n","October 20, 2015","false","1.3"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/losian/recommended/325600/","losian","Losian Rooke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/losian/","285 products in account","Decent.\n\nAll in all, it's decent. Not great, it sure as hell isn't the new coming of Neverwinter Nights 1 or 2, but it's okay.\n\nThe biggest issue is that, like many games in recent times, it cripples it's open-endedness, design, and flexibility for the sake of "pure" online experiences. That is to say, there is a DM client, you can make quests.. but they're all very flat and simple. Extremely limited. If not you could potentially spawn items, use it in online games with other people, etc. etc.\n\nNow, frankly, I think "who cares? why do we keep ruining games by protecting against the idiot minority that we'll never really stop anyways?" But none the less, it's what they did.\n\nThe gameplay itself is reasonably familiar to anyone who is keen on NWN/DA/BG/etc. You got your party, your potions, your skills and spells and all that. It's based on the newer 5th edition on D&D. I'm sad nobody ever worked 4th into a proper PC RPG because it was absolutely PERFECT for translation.\n\nThat said, they seem to have made some of the usual adjustments - and mind you, I'm wide open to interpretations for the sake of a game with a ruleset like D&D, but well.. You basically get a handful of skill trees. Spend points, go down 'em to get abilities, so forth. No real feats or anything. It's also worth emphasizing that the balance is way wonky. The abilityes DO NOT scale with level. We've gotten a few acts in playing co-op and right now just melee-ing does waaaay more damage than any ability any of us have (even the wizard!) It seems to me that spending points should raise damage dice, which then scale with level, etc.\n\nIt may be a small thing but the font drives me insane for some reason. It's very soft and rounded and fuzzy. It looks like it belongs in a game for children, not in an RPG I'm supposed to take seriously. All the menus and spells and combat just feels way too round and soft due to the UI/font and design choices.\n\nThe voices are pretty well done. The quests and dialogues are decent, if not all that compelling at times (ho there evildoers, surrender! you won't surrender? then i will kill you! oh you tried to kill me, you must be evildoers!) There's a decent handful of companions with their own backstories and quests and such. The game itself is reasonably bug free, though we've had some quirkiness. A few items we searched not showing up, some occasional funk with a disappearing mouse cursor, trouble loading, but nothing has been downright game breaking.\n\nOver all, really and truly, it's just decent. It's not a super expensive game, it's well voiced and looks pretty alright, and it's an *okay* adapation of D&D. It misses SO MUCH of what made games like NWN/NWN2 great, unfortunately. There's really no 'skills' to spend points on, just stat checks, so gone are your persuasion/intimidation/etc. There seem to be frightfully few opportunities to do ANYTHING except kill your way to a resolution of almost every situation. Earlier on in the game we had a handful of "oh we coulda done that" or "because we did that and this we can now go this way" but it seems to have tapered off dramatically to very straightforward kill-them-all, as usual.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, it just isn't NWN. It's not BG. The open-endedness and flexibility are nonexistant in the name of online matchmaking fairness and all that nonsense, and it really gutted what coulda been neat. The DMs just don't have near enough control or ability to make something compelling and customize much of anything. It's really very disappointing.\n\nBut, anyways.. if you want any kind of party-based RPG then you know the pickings are slim these days. If not for that then I imagine Sword Coast would fall a bit lower, but when you already have so few choices you kinda have to take what you get.. and Sword Coast is decent, just plain decent. I wish it were better, I wish it were more, but it isn't. But it's still playable and you can still get at least a partial fix for that style of game from it. Pillars of Eternity did it way better, though lacking the co-op of course, sadly.\n\nBut by no means does all this mean it's a "bad" game, it has a lot to live up to, it just only does an "okay" job of living up to it.","October 27, 2015","true","27.7"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

Being an old geezer with the commitments that go with it co-op play doesn't really work for me and for once I don't feel excluded from the epxerience.

The locations and interiors look and feel like those from the days when I played 1st edition in the eraly '80s.  Encounters work like they did for me back then - a series of set pieces where you can bring a fireball to bear without alerting 700 square miles of antagonists - may lack realsim but it's how we used to play.\n\nLoving the character customisation - looking forward to 'role the whole party' which I undrstand will come in 2016.  With this feature this won't be far away from delivering the feel that Troika's Temple of Elemental evil delivered (best D&D adaptation ever in my humble opinion) but with a more instant action pay off for which I am very grateful.  Also very pleased with the frequency of loot and the uniqueness of the visual impact of items - something severely lacking in neverwinter online or whatever that was called.\n\nLooking forward to messing about with the editor.  My furstration with NWN was that the editor requried too much scripting knowledge to be accessible to someone without programming skills (mine started and ended with Applesoft basic on Apple DOS 3.2).  A simpler configuration based tool works for me and any expansion of the tool set capability over time is a bonus.\n\nCan't comment on the DM element of the game as haven't and probably won't use it.\n\nWhen evaluating this I think I need to do this against other D&D titles and for me it is the best one since the Troika and Black Isle titles.  I liked NWN but it always felt like it was missing something and I think that was look and feel which this game has in bundles.  It whoops D&D online, Neverwinter On Line and that dreadful 'daggerdale' title!  I won't even mention the shocker that was 'Dragonshard'.  How does it compare to other non D&D titles - probably need to get further in to it but I think it compares favourably to Pillars as Pillars was D&D like without being D&D (same goes for Dragon Age Origins) and as I said before, this really does feel like D&D.  Benchmark for non D&D games from the last couple of years is probably Wasteland 2 and to be fair that probably has the edge on gameplay and the true complex tactical RPG experience, but then it is still not D&D!\n\nFinally someone commented that some of the elements of this feel a bit MMORPG ish and I think that is a fair observation but I think it is incorrect to view this as a negative.  Would love to have seen a WoW spin off with a role your own party and tactical combat option.  Does this deliver that - not far off I have to say.\n\nIf plenty of good quality DLC comes this will keep me inetersted for quite a while I expect.  The improvements promised will be a bonus rather than a necessity - would still love to have a 5 character party option though as the compromises associated with 4 feel a bit mean.","November 8, 2015","true","61.2"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

Don't expect Steading of the HIll Giant Chief but Temple of the Frog (Blackmoor Version!) you can make happen with a good DM!\n\nIt's not tabletop DnD and not the latest rules (or really any particular ruleset for that matter), but is about as close as we have gotten to a collaborative DnD online since the game began. It is a real treat  to be able to create the experience of PEOPLE  playing together, as opposed to playing a computer.  While Story mode is good and there can be many more stories created by the "official" content creators, the real future of this is with the stories everyone else can create with the Dungeon Master tools.\n\nThere has been a lot of groaning and gnashing of teeth about the things that can't be created today, the "missing" options and assets, etc, etc, ad nauseum.  The fact is, there is enough there to make some good basic modules and get started enjoying the experience.  The live streams and the great modules by folks which are already available clearly demonstrate that.  Do we need more?  Lots more?  Dragons, Orcs, and more? Absolutley.\n\nRight now the creation tools are very basic and limited, but pretty cool to play with even now.  Just to be able to take control of a Boss and have it interact with the players is a lot of fun and when you add in some (in my case definetly amateurish!) voice overs, well, it just works.\n\nThis product is a baby, just born (officially) today.  The team that built it has (from what I have seen) a great vision and some great skills. They have delivered a stable platform on the PC and the Mac with consoles to follow (which is no mean feat in today's complex world) to enjoy for the story and for the early stages of dynamic dungeon mastering (tm). While there are still some performance issues and certianly some platform specific issues, it runs great and mutliplayer is pretty stable.  Certainly more stable than most MMO launches to date.\n\nRecommended if you are ready to play some fun DnD characters while enjoying a good story (solo or co-op) and also if you are ready to start experimenting with your online Dungeon Mastering skills with the limited tools available today in the initial release.","October 20, 2015","true","9.0"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

Benchmark for non D&D games from the last couple of years is probably Wasteland 2 and to be fair that probably has the edge on gameplay and the true complex tactical RPG experience, but then it is still not D&D!\n\nFinally someone commented that some of the elements of this feel a bit MMORPG ish and I think that is a fair observation but I think it is incorrect to view this as a negative.  Would love to have seen a WoW spin off with a role your own party and tactical combat option.  Does this deliver that - not far off I have to say.\n\nIf plenty of good quality DLC comes this will keep me inetersted for quite a while I expect.  The improvements promised will be a bonus rather than a necessity - would still love to have a 5 character party option though as the compromises associated with 4 feel a bit mean.","November 8, 2015","true","61.2"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

Don't expect Steading of the HIll Giant Chief but Temple of the Frog (Blackmoor Version!) you can make happen with a good DM!\n\nIt's not tabletop DnD and not the latest rules (or really any particular ruleset for that matter), but is about as close as we have gotten to a collaborative DnD online since the game began. It is a real treat  to be able to create the experience of PEOPLE  playing together, as opposed to playing a computer.  While Story mode is good and there can be many more stories created by the "official" content creators, the real future of this is with the stories everyone else can create with the Dungeon Master tools.\n\nThere has been a lot of groaning and gnashing of teeth about the things that can't be created today, the "missing" options and assets, etc, etc, ad nauseum.  The fact is, there is enough there to make some good basic modules and get started enjoying the experience.  The live streams and the great modules by folks which are already available clearly demonstrate that.  Do we need more?  Lots more?  Dragons, Orcs, and more? Absolutley.\n\nRight now the creation tools are very basic and limited, but pretty cool to play with even now.  Just to be able to take control of a Boss and have it interact with the players is a lot of fun and when you add in some (in my case definetly amateurish!) voice overs, well, it just works.\n\nThis product is a baby, just born (officially) today.  The team that built it has (from what I have seen) a great vision and some great skills. They have delivered a stable platform on the PC and the Mac with consoles to follow (which is no mean feat in today's complex world) to enjoy for the story and for the early stages of dynamic dungeon mastering (tm). While there are still some performance issues and certianly some platform specific issues, it runs great and mutliplayer is pretty stable.  Certainly more stable than most MMO launches to date.\n\nRecommended if you are ready to play some fun DnD characters while enjoying a good story (solo or co-op) and also if you are ready to start experimenting with your online Dungeon Mastering skills with the limited tools available today in the initial release.","October 20, 2015","true","9.0"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

Its to action orientated and seems shallow compared to 2.0 (or even 3.5). Sad that such a great game had to back down to casuals to stay alive and grovel before the mainstrema.\n\nThat aside, for a RPG-game it seems pretty decent so far (only 6ish hours gametime). I quiet enjoy myself starting a story-mode on hard right away and it keeps me entertained. The challenge is not so great after hitting lvl 3, but i guess there will be stuff coming.\n\nHad some laughs in the story so far but was not overwhelmed by it (pretty much stereotype story every bad GM could just cook up without thinking). Might hold potential, who knows? Will update later.\n\nSide quest so far are horrible (at least most of them). They are soooo easy and just on the "main story road".

It appears as if the developers in their haste to get the game to market and please both the hard core D&D enthusiast and the console gamer community compromised on the product and probably didn't hit the mark with either.\n\nFor those that have spent decades enjoying D&D the purist in me was disappointed that the product missed the mark on delivering a gaming experience to even come clost to a tabletop game with the richness that it can provide.  The story line was weak, the game mechanics to dissimilar to the 5e rules,  the control of the characters in the game was lacking when in battle allowing them to do whatever they wanted and the AI was lacking in its ability to make even the most basic "good" decisions.  The game feels like you are just going along for the ride as a disinterested third party.  I lost interest in the game very quickly on as it was also slow and jerky with the graphics being just ok.  All of this combined made me abort on spending hours trying to get enjoyment out of it when I have other things that I can do that will provide me more enjoyment such as actually playing D&D, reading a book etc.  For those that haven't experienced better computer simulations of D&D it may work for you but the purist will be dissapointed.","November 8, 2015","false","119.1"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

If you play it co-op you will find some enjoyment but the single player campaign is just ok for me. The combat is not strategic in anyway, it's essentially MMO combat with cool downs. I'm not even going to comment on the editor as it is very limited. Just a lot of odd design choices and quirks, consider Wizard's allowed this to be the first D&D crpg in sometime I was expecting a lot more from it and a lot more polish.\n\nThis may sound like the smallest nitpicky example but in one of the first dungeons there are Mimic's google it if you're not familiar with the monster. In this game simply hovering over the chest will tell you it's a mimic so any chance of being surprised is gone.

If you're also expecting another Baldur's Gate or Planescape Torment, and fun co-operative play, you should look elsewhere. However, in my opinion, this is a great rpg with a great story and customization - though not as deep as it could be.\n\n\nLike many here, my biggest disappointment with Sword Coast: Legends is with the Module Creation tools. If you've played Neverwinter Online and used the Foundry, well this is pathetic compared to that. If I'd bought it just to create and share modules then I would be pretty annoyed at myself for not looking at it closer before release, and with the developers for such a let down. I have looked into it since the release date and watched a twitch video where the developers say that they are listening... so perhaps the creation tools we all want will come, with time.\nThe second biggest disappointment for me came with multiplayer. I bought this to play through the story from start to finish with my friend, but it's just not worth the effort. The second player can't control any of the NPCs or advance the main story, the dialogue just shifts to the host. Loot isnt shared, its basically first come, first serve. If you're off exploring in different directions, clicking something like a corpse with dialogue (i.e "You find a note") drags the other player to the first, and that can be unbelievably annoying in the Underdark. Maybe it was a better experience for others, but for me it was just awful. I played through solo.\nI do think the game itself is getting a bit of an unfair bashing. As a game, 40 hours long, I enjoyed it and it was worth the asking price. I enjoyed the story and the companions, and yes it could have been much deeper and much more involved, but as it is, its good. The last video after completing the game did come across rather like... "Oh damn we forgot to leave an opening for an expansion, quick, add it in here!" but otherwise it's a good, solid, rpg. I've never completed Baldur's Gate or played Planescape Torment or any of those old classics, so perhaps that it why it succeeds with me and not others.\nFor me there was only really one bug, and that was with the character select loading screen. Going from a game/module/dungeon crawl back to the character select is basically a no-go, unless I either want to wait 10 minutes or close the game and reopen it. Its definitely annoying, but not game-breaking, in my opinion. I was pretty much lucky throughout the game otherwise and didn't suffer anything worse than that, unlike my friend who's characters kept dying everytime he entered a shop (that was funny enough to be worth his frustration!)\nThe two disappointments I've listed above are pretty major parts of the game, and yet I still recommend it to others, as long as they know what it is they're getting first. I liked it a lot more than Pillars of Eternity, the only game of the type that I can compare it to, and its one of the very few I've actually completed on Steam.\n","October 27, 2015","true","43.2"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

This aside,  I fully recommend this game to others, not because the game is perfect right now ( it isn't ), but because of the promise the game and the developers hold. For more in depth thoughts see below. Most of my thoughts are about the DM mode because I really believe that is where this game shines, or will shine.\n\nI normally don't write reviews because I think outside of clearly broken games, most of them come down to personal preference. This game however has struck something with me and i feel the want to share my opinion on it, for what it is worth.\n\nI went into one of the head starts really wanting to love this game. I have been wanting this sort of rpg, co-op, DM-able game for a long time. To be fair I love table top games, both board and roleplaying. I also enjoy playing various console and computer games with my friends, who sadly don't always have the time to come by the house physically.  While we can spend a few hours at night over the internet playing games, it is tougher to schedule time to get together in person.\n\nWhen I saw the initial desription of of Sword Coast Legends I was , as I stated, really excited by the prospect. I could create and DM over the internet for my friends. The possibilities seemed endless. I mean I enjoy Neverwinter and other games such as that, but none allowed the direct control that this game offered. DM'ing in real time...\n\nThe first few head starts were fun and we all had a blast. Random dungeon crawls, creating simple modules to explore the toolset. The idea of DM loot, threat and balance seemed very cool. By release I noticed that things were very limiting, far more so than I had hoped.\n\nThe dialog boxes, for instance, were very small, limiting my npc discussion to something like one paragraph. I don't know the exact character count but it was small and made it very hard to get across any meaningful story. Add to this no branching dialog or answer customization so all conversations were basically limited to "Will you?" "Yes we accept".\n\nWhile there are a fair number of tile/dungeon sets and they are randomizable, they still felt limiting. I could not create ruins inside of a cavern for instance. I had to have a cavern then a seperate ruins map. This isn't a big deal, but more freedom in the way I lay out my dungeon, especially for specific story points would be cool and welcomed.\n\nThe over world tiles are even less free. These are often small with no real outside "dungeon" maps. Instead you are offered a tiny city block or a forest path on the average with a few slightly larger variants thrown in. While you can create multiple areas and force the characters to load into one then the next, it made the process and game play clunky.\n\nThere are more, but my point is that the DM system felt limiting over all and dashed some of my hopes for what I could ultimately do, or how long I could hold players interest in the same basic thing repeated over and over.\n\nThis is not even touching the amount of odd bugs encountered like quest givers giving quests while playing without a dm, but as soon as a physical DM controlled the game the quests stopped being offered. This is only one example of a few things that are/were broken in the first month of release.\n\nSo the above all said why would I enjoy this game or recommend it to others? The answer is simple. The game has great promise, the amount of things that can be done with this system are giant in scope. The developers seem to recognize that and are working with the public rather than ignoring the complaints. They have already placed a road map to addressing everything I have mentioned here and more. They hope to have much of my complaints gone within the next 2 months..and that is simply the start of their progress.\n\nThis carries a lot of weight with a game I think. Not that the game had issues, but rather that the team is willing to say sorry and work toward making everything even better than originally imagined. For this reason I support Sword Coast Legends and I look forward to playing it quite a bit more, creating even better adventures with the improvements being made.\n\nTime will tell if they deliver.","October 30, 2015","true","35.0"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","12","22","0","0"

What happens on a tabletop does not always translate well into a computer game.  Computers calculate equations faster and things move quicker. If computers were as accessible and advanced as they are now and Gygax had originally worked on DnD for a computer simulation then the ruleset would have certainly been different than the tabletop rules.\n\nFor example, let's look at the cooldowns.  The tabletop ruleset limits some of your cooldowns per rest and this is not the way it works on the computer game and there's a good reason; it wouldn't mesh well.  On the tabletop game a single battle can last well over 15 minutes and spells per rest made sense.  After a long battle or two and 30 minutes exploring the area your players were naturally ready for a break.  It fit naturally into the pace and time frame in which things were being played.  A computer is calculating battles millions of times faster than players at a tabletop ever could do so things are much faster paced.  It doesn't make sense to delay the player to spells per rest when we are able to have back to back battles in very short amount of time.  It doesn't fit the flow in which we are now playing.  The shift in the ruleset is appropriate because tabletop rules don't always mesh well when translated to computer. People are up in arms because the ruleset is a little different and they dont even consider why  All they know is that it deviated from the rulebook and it is immediately a terrible game.\n\nEven though some basic rule sets have been modified to fit a computer simulation the heart and soul of DnD is still very much there and this is why I am loving this game.  I understand that DnD on a tabletop plays much slower and some changes needed to be made to fit that.  I am okay with that.  At the end of that day I am able to make my character function the way I would want to in a tabletop setting and enjoy the great fantasy world of DnD.  My rogue can specialize in disarming traps and picking locks and going into stealth to backstab enemies for extra damage.  That is what I would expect my particular rogue to do in a tabletop game and it is what I can do here.  When playing this game I can sense the deep devotion to DnD all throughout the game. Good job Devs, I am really enjoying my time in this game.","October 20, 2015","true","52.4"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

I loaded it up and get stuck straight into the editor. Being able to build your own tavern, and populate it with D&D characters is great.  There is so much you can do with that editor in terms of creating locations and quests for people to play.\n\nThen hosting that module as a DM and having players run through it was a great experience. Perhaps my only criticism is that you could do with some more of the mages spells, and perhaps the UI could have been improved. As someone who loved the Baldur’s gate  I really enjoyed the detail of spells in that game.\n\nI haven’t played the single issue campaign enough to make a judgment on it.\n\nOverall I would certainly recommend this game, especially if you enjoy the idea of being a DM and crafting modules. All the modules people will create should add a lot of playability and originality to keep things fresh, compared to some other dungeon crawlers that can end up getting a bit repetitive.\n","October 21, 2015","true","27.5"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","12","22","2","0"

Many of the bad reviews comes from people expecting something the game did not turn out to be.  On its own merits, this is something of an aRPG/CRPG that has a somewhat classic D&D feel in style. The DM toolset is workable to quickly make simple modules to tell your story in, but lacks scripting complexity.\n\nThere is also a big lack of iconic monsters for the DM's use. That may change over time. If your primary draw is to build adventures similar to NWN, this may not be the right title for you.

I will not write comparative analyses relative to other games. At first, I approached the game as a DnD player and fan of Planescape Torment, but I will not compare this game with Torment, because they are different games entirely.\n\nThere are simple but customisable skill trees. Although customisation is fairly limited at the moment, I feel that I have the freedom to build, for example, a mage as a melee tank, as a ranged character with infinite bullets, or as a big spell caster that runs out of steam way too fast. In this case, I feel that a mage in this game plays his role best as a crowd control character with ridiculous levels of AC. There seem to be gear and skill choices befitting a mage played in nearly any role, but I am mildly disappointed by the use of cooldowns for a character which I wanted so much to be more about planning and cunning tactical choices than about disabling enemies and wailing on them with a staff in autoattack mode. I feel like there is something there, but the skills could be tweaked a bit to make wizards feel more like what the community probably expects. For me, I restarted as a rogue, hoping things would be different, but again, the best skills were ways to avoid enemy retaliation, since damage is so lackluster.\n\nThe other character classes also use cooldown-based abilities, and my disappointment in player character design is twofold - because abilities are cooldown-driven, no single ability feels overwhelmingly powerful, and as such, glass cannon builds feel nonexistent, and adding to that, no single ability feels worth building a character around or commiting to, and sadly, nor does any one strategy. In a sense, this is a good thing, because in the end, I feel that I have a balanced player character. On the other hand, because many of my skill choices felt forced by the metagame (enemies have ludicrous amounts of HP, even in easy mode), I feel that my player character is not my own.It is almost as though the game designers took the idea of creativity through limitation a bit too far.\n\nBeyond this, but still in the vein of player character customisation, the removal of skill checks from the game, and the replacement of those (with the exception of perception, disable device, and lockpicking) by ability score checks, could have returned the game to its AD&D roots, but the proclivity of +8 stat potions appearing as random loot and merchant wares, coupled with the inability of the Player to choose an NPC to make the checks itself, makes this aspect of the game only fun if you do not allow yourself to save and reload regularly. Sadly, the consequences of failing skill checks or passing them almost always leads to the same conclusion - fighting or more gold.\n\nIn conclusion, this game needs, in my eyes, a few changes before it is really ready to be a fun game to play.\n\nFirst of all, player characters need to feel like their characters are their own. This means that many types of characters, both awful but fun choices and awfully powerful choices should exist for many, if not all, class skill trees. Diversity is one thing, but emergent gameplay is a prerequisite to a fun video game where so much customisation lies on the player character's own skill and equipment choices. That said, more-interesting item abilities could go a long way in allowing for emergent gameplay.\n\nSecond of all, the game itself needs to have, at the very least, more realistic consequences for failed or successful skill checks or ability score checks. Introducing a skill system and going through the single player campaign to introduce them into dialogues should not be as hard as it seems. I should be able to miss out on entire sidequests and such if my character cannot persuade an NPC to open up about something. A robust single player campaign is replayable, and a replayable game is one in which your choices feel different, or at the very least, feel as though they could have been different. I want the freedom to slaughter the adventuring party I carried back a chest from the underdark for, in their inn room, so that I can intimidate the survivor into revealing the method of opening the chest, or at the very least, to try and persuade that party for a bit of its contents. The lack of choices in quests like that one made me feel that my roleplaying choices were nonexistent, since everything ended up the same way.\n\nThird of all, and most importantly, the game designers are listening to the players and coming up with patches to improve the game. If it were not for this, I might not feel that it was worthwhile to speak up in the community. For one, I am legitimately excited about the patch release notes and the plans for the second week of November, as well as the plans for future weeks. Drow, Tieflings, more-diverse player skill trees, and hopefully cooler enemies could be the first step towards rebalancing the game in a way that makes it feel, if not like DnD 5.0, at least then like a serious RPG acheiving its goals.\n\nI think that the success of other RPGs in the past has been found in optimising a mixture of devoting time to customising characters and creating a place where players feel challenged to apply those customisations for some sense of ultimate reward for their characters. In the absence of legendary artifacts, required to make your build complete, only completable by prohibitively challenging boss encounters, and in the absence of highly powerful or greatly entertaining player characters that feel cheesy or comical to play, I can understand why players feel the game is lackluster on average. But free DLC and patches have saved games from an untimely death in the past, and I feel the core engine driving this game, and its development team, have the talent to pull off what we, as players, want to see with precisely what is standing before us.\n\nThat said, I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to see this game blossom into a thing of beauty, because this game has what it takes, and with enough support, will continue in the right direction; on the other hand, I expect the company will take some weeks to reposition this game as the one which players wanted to see to begin with, so if ou do not buy it now, then strongly consider doing so in mid to late November, when the most-interesting patches are being released.","October 30, 2015","true","70.9"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","13","24","0","0"

It's a great way for my friends and I to play D&D while not being able to get to anyone's house all at once. As with any game of this nature, there will be some balance work that needs doing, especially once they start adding additional classes and races. There is a story mode and it's well done and well presented. You can use your characters in any playable capacity, be it in the story, a player-made module, or a randomly generated dungeon. Don't feel discouraged if you feel there's not enough content. Players were cranking out module content immediately on release. Many are quite good and accessing them is quick and easy. Expect to see a lot of user-generated content. As for official content updates, the developers have already announced an early free content release schedule. The potential for this game is massive. The core design is solid but adaptable, allowing for potentially unlimited updating and expanding content and features.  Races, classes, tilesets, items, gear. SCL plays a lot like Diablo in that it can get to be a quick-paced high intensity dungeon crawl. The story is fairly linear, although it has dialogue options. Give it a chance and play with others as well. It's designed for social interaction and it's a big with there too.\n\n","November 6, 2015","true","29.4"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","0"

As part of the Design Council, I am sorry for the loss of N-Space. Even though they jumped the gun trying to get the console release instead of getting Rage of Demons out there for us to try. I will be honest here.. The Design Council doesn't do much and I hope Digital Extremes actually puts us to work instead of waiting forever for something to test or talk about. I really love. This game, but there's a lot to catch up on. So guys, if I were you.. I would uninstall the game for now and wait till Rage of Demons to come out (which is really close from what I read on the forums).","May 7","true","118.4"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","13","24","0","0"

There is no reason to discount the statements they've made.  A lot are true.  I've been playing since early access, but haven't been able to play much since the game itself came out.  I'm aware of what Sword Coast attempts to do and the high goals it set for itself with the timeframe and small team it had.\n\nThis game was never intended to be Neverwinter Nights and it's pretty clear from the getgo, watching streams, basic playing - how everything is a cooldown, etc.  If you're looking for NWN3 or something that is as sincere to D&D as possible, move on.  You're not going to find it here.  That's not meant to be an insult; this game is just never going to be that.  That said...\n\nWe have a game that tries to strike a balance between the action of Diablo or other Hack 'n Slashes, and the slower paced nature of games like Baldur's Gate.  It was always going to be iffy to get it to work well, and while the system works, many have stated how it feels like there's little to no choice - especially when playing a single character - and they have very valid points.\n\nI could go into detail for each and every point, but I won't.  The bottom line is Sword Coast set out to do a LOT, and it seems that in trying to deliver on their goals even existing in the game, many of them are not refined and polished to a point.  We've got a lot of things here, but they're all sorta 'okay.'  Lack of time, lack of staff.  The lack of DM tools has been especially harsh.\n\nEven disregarding the people who were never going to be satisfied because this isn't Neverwinter Nights 3, the game still leaves quite a good bit to be desired.  However...I see that the framework is there for just about everything.\n\nIf this is where the story ends I couldn't really reccommend it as anything else than a 'solid' 4-player co-op campaign experience.  And that's not really enough, given the price tag.  But that's not where the story ends...yet.  Gandalf has fallen with the Balrog, but he may still rise.  That's up to N-Space.\n\nSword Coast's developers have recently posted this bit of news:\nhttps://swordcoast.com/content/sword-coast-legends-state-game\n\nThere are lots of good things in that list, and it's nice to see something more concrete.  A tileset/level editor is mentioned, branching dialog, loot tables, ninja looting, *Mod support*, quite a bit of things to go through.\n\nI give this game a reccomendation on the condition the developers are able to follow through.  I'm placing my faith in them.  This doesn't mean 'buy it now' - it means if they're able to follow through, this game could become more like what a lot were hoping for - it would just need time to get off the ground.\n\nI'll give them the misstep on the knowledge that they're very small and just couldn't get through everything they wanted, but you've only got so much time in the industry to turn it around.  Good luck, N-Space.  I hope you're successful with this list of changes and additions, because then this game will be great.","October 30, 2015","true","16.9"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","14","26","0","0"

It's hard to track down how racial or background choices impact your character, or how leveling works. There's an incomplete wiki with some of the data, but the game is missing inline details. If this were intended as a casual game, that would be understandable. But on normal difficulty, it is very hard to keep everyone alive without micromanaging the whole party (not just your "primary" PC).\n\nYet the game's interface screams casual. Is that dire wolf going to be hard or easy for my party? I have no idea. Am I in bow range? No idea. So my thief hides and starts sneaking up on the wolf. Suddenly cover is blown (why? I have no idea how cover/hiding works in this game) and the wolf charges my thief. In one hit, the thief drops to critical hitpoints. I tell my fighter to intercept the wolf, but somehow my fighter doesn't actually seem able to do so. And now my thief is bleeding out. All in about 3 seconds. I haven't even started thinking about how to deal with the other wolves charging into the battle.\n\nNow if I carefully manage each character, I can manage (mostly), especially if I abuse the AI by luring individuals away from the group. But as far as understanding mechanics (is my thief proking opportunity attacks by using a bow at point blank range?), it's a very blank slate.\n\nThe pacing is slow (largely because individual combat has to be micromanaged); inventory management is tedious; response to commands is sluggish (I clicked that piece of terrain and my character didn't move; ah, of course that piece of grass was part of the barrier and you wanted me to click 2 pixels to the right on that other piece of grass).\n\nAs an engine, it has a lot of potential. But it isn't close to Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter Nights. It isn't an ARPG. And it isn't casual. So I'm not sure what it's intended to be. By the point they are offering a free trial, I expect a lot more than this...let alone before I fork over $40. (Or even $20.)","December 18, 2015","false","3.0"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","15","28","0","0"

This game is NOT a substitute for a table top 5th ed game, that being said it clearly draws enough influence from 5th ed that I was able to sit down and immediately know how to build my fighter, and how to play the game without paying attention to any tutorials or tool tips.\n\nSome people have likened the combat in this game to DA:Origins and I would lend my consent to that.  The game is a hybrid mix of real-time turn based combat, just like that game had, with the ability to pause the game and issue orders to your party.  If you just like playing your character and let the AI do the work for the other characters you are free to do that as well, though expect a harder game if you dont control them at least some.\n\nBack to the topic od DnD, this game most certainly takes place in Faerun, whether you care for that setting or not, it is without a doubt a DnD setting.  The game also hosts many chances to make RP decisions, though like many RPG video games this often boils down to: Bleeding heart, Give me money and we have a deal, and  I kill you options.  The main purpose behind this review is encourage people to not buy heedlessly into these many rage reviews.  The game is enjoyable and it isn't lying when it claims to be based on DnD.  Just remember 'Based on' means derivative, not identical.","October 21, 2015","true","33.9"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","16","30","2","0"

I usually enjoy mmorpgs like WoW and I even liked Diablo 3 a little bit. But most of these D&D style games tend to be a bit too hard for me, and some top-down rpgs are straight up brutal with mechanics, fast pacing and no pause options.\n\nSCL is great for those who like a little bit of everything from all of the above games but aren't die-hard fans of any. I enjoy the company of my boyfriend and our mutual friend, playing at our pace, knowing each of our limitations and tailoring stuff to fit ourselves so no one has to feel like they need to force themselves to have fun. It's a great game to play with friends and loved ones, if you aren't too strict with just how faithful the game has to be to the genre. I would recommend having at least one person who doesn't mind micro-managing npcs in the party if you don't intend to bring a full 4 players. It's great fun to DM the dungeon crawls or even modules of your own too - while limited, the tools aren't very hard to use at all, which I count as a positive. Even more fun to choose your own path to advance your characters - I really like having a close friend as a DM so they can tailor the experience to not be too hard or too easy for my character.\nI think this is a great asset for any game, since in many games these days your experience is pretty much on rails and unmodifiable to suit your abilities.\n\nAs far as solo play goes: Please note that for some hardened veterans, the story mode can be a bit too easy. As for newer players like myself it can even be a bit too hard. A lot of the difficulty depends on how fun one finds managing the npcs.\n\nAll in all a neat top-down rpg for those old and new to D&D rules alike. Although for veterans, I have to stress that you shouldn't expect perfection. =) Watch actual gameplay footage or even a friend who has already bought the game, and you'll get a clear idea of what to expect like I did! I have no regrets of buying it nor do I intend to refund.","October 23, 2015","true","11.5"," 50 of 98 people (51%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","51","50","98","7","0"

I read so many people write that that game did D&D right. Well, looks like they were correct. Here's a game from 2001 that is actually D&D. 3.5e D&D. Everything about that game is more advanced than this game except for the graphics.\n\nAnyway, if you are looking for an ARPG Torchlight-2 type game that references D&D but does things like uses skill trees that are shared between classes , cooldowns for abilities, and scaling monsters (e.g. you fight the same type of monsters at level 1 and level 20 because they just scale the health, which means autoattacks become your main attacks, skills become useless) you may enjoy this game.\n\nI've had a good time playing w/the kids but really all it's done is make me want to play P&P D&D, and now that I've tried ToE I'll just stick with that. I don't know how much of SCL is left to play in the main campaign, we're running around Luskan doing quests at lvl 6, but I don't really care given everything I read about higher level play and how monotone the monsters are right now. I mean we fight everything the same way, undead, humanoids, demons. They all seem to fight the same way. There's no dread "oh no a ghoul he can paralyze us" - doesn't matter just blast away, and you'll get unparalyzed after a few seconds, no strategy required, no more threatening than a simple skeleton or a rat.\n\nWhen I read that Meteor Swarm has  a 380s cooldown doing 200hp dmg and the monsters have 1500hp - does not sound like something to look forward to.\n\nThe kids are still having fun, they're DM'ing each other, chasing the vendors around and making traps on top of each other. That's what whoever that bigwig at nSPACE wanted, he wanted a game that 8 year olds could DM, and that's what was produced, my 8/10/12 yr olds are having a ball.\n\n========================================================\nI kept my original review below for reference. It used to be a "recommended" rating.\n========================================================\n\n\nI've played Basic, AD&D, 3.0/3.5/Pathfinder, 4E (didn't like) and 5th (like again). We played NWN games and D:OS.\n\nI'm having fun playing the story co-op with my kids. No it's not table-top rules, and if you make it pause every round to try to get Divinity:OS style combat it's kind of weird. After playing w/pause every round on and getting the hang of it we turned pause off and we're having fun.\n\nAgain, it's not D&D, it is D&D-based, you have the basic classes, they have the basic spells, they use cooldowns instead of short rests, it maks it all work out. Yes we enjoyed all the NWN games, this is different, but it's still fun.\n\nYes almost everyone can heal themselves, that's good for this type of game. I usually have to play the healer because no one else wants to, so it gives me a chance to play a DPS class for a change. That's good.\n\nI'll update the review later but I just wanted to get something up to recommend the game because of all the negative reviews and my own negative initial reaction simply because of the expectation that it would be more table-top like game vs what it is, a fun D&D-based CRPG.\n\nAll that being said, monster scaling is a real problem. In D&D you earn the right to fight more amazing higher level monsters. You level up and earn the right to instagib those level 1 monsters.\n\nThere are lots of problems with multiplayer co-op. The game is clearly designed for console drop in / drop out style gameplay, not for your weekly D&D group consistent gameplay. Interacting with NPCs while playing co-op is extremely frustrating. Inventory control is bad (no way to trade anything, have to drop loot and pick it up - no way to transfer gold). NO way to switch who talks to a NPC (say you have a high CHA char and there is a CHA check, can't switch to the pally, the game host is the only one who interacts in those dialogs).\n\nMany other issues, but we're still having fun.","October 24, 2015","true","34.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It really does need more added to it, but DMing while people go through a dungeon or a module is pretty fun.\n\nI'd still wait until it's on sale and more is added, but I'm changing from a thumbs down to a thumbs up.\n\n\n\n\n*This is based solely on content creation*\n\nI bought it for the DM toolset, but imagine my disappointment with the lack of placeable objects, monsters, and tiles. I was hoping to make a mountain village, but the only structures you can actually place are tents.\n\nI don't mind the auto-generated dungeons/outdoor areas, but to make it truly great, being able to build the dungeon room by room would be great. Technically, they've got the stuff for it already, because it's automated. It would be a nice option to have an advanced mode for manual placement.Other than that, I just want bigger placeables(i.e huts, houses, and the like), more objects and more monster variety.\n\nThe monster variety is slim. Where are the kobolds, orcs, trolls, and dragons? Staples to the D&D franchise and yet they are non-existant. We've got tons of drow, zombies, skeletons, goblins, and then the normal races as of now. Yes there are a small handful of other creatures tied in with the other sets, but not enough. It's unrealistic to expect every creature there is, but to leave out the iconic monsters? Why?\n\nThe quest system was disappointing too. There is a big need for branching dialogue\Quests. A way to give story to the players, or lore to the DMs who may download a module to run.\n\nThe loot options are pretty sad. You can customize what a quest gives out, as far as 'Random trinket, weapon, or armor'. You can't determine what precise loot will be distributed or customize magical items.*\n\nFrom a creators standpoint, this game missed the mark, but it does provide the framework to be good if it's supported and added to.\n\nI have no idea if any of these are in the works, but for me to be justified in buying it, all of the aforementioned need to be in the game (*With the exception to the loot. It's what I would like to see, but it's nothing major.)","October 20, 2015","true","31.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Not unmanageable just a bit of an oversight.\n* The pause option can be a bit annoying - it sometimes forgets you had selected attack when you unpause.\n* The voice acting overall is suprisingly good, just let down at a couple of points.\n* The pathfinding is sometimes off, your npc companions sometimes run into walls when following, but its not a common thing.\n\nOverall its a good rpg and a decent game.

I've been a huge fan of the D&D games (tabletop, PC, and console) for about 22 years or more.  I love this game!  I like that the map is Faerun.  I the familiarity of lands I've read about in the novels.  I love references to other lands mentioned in previous D&D games.  IS THIS THE BEST D&D GAME?  No.  I love Baldur's Gate II and Icewind Dale.  I thought those games were about as close to table top, book, paper, dice D&D as any game has come.  I'm not sure if the studio was the one making certain claims and promises or if it was the fans running their mouths in anticipation of SCL coming out that information got skewed.  ...but I don't really care.  I love the storyline.  Great voice acting.  The game looks great.  There are several things that I wish the game had, but the nice thing about it is that it seams to offer plenty of room for GROWTH.  I can see more and more quests and campaigns coming from the studio.  I can see Faerun being fleshed out in this game over next couple years.  I'm excited to think about campaigns in Mithral Hall, Menzoberannzen, The Ten Towns, or maybe even Thay.  I've read so many of the novels that take place in Faerun that I can't help but wonder how much DLC is going to happen for this game.  I loved playing through this storyline, and I'm excited to see what happens next.  I like what they've given us so far, and I can't wait to see what's coming.

Your character is pretty customizable as for stats, races, and classes. I do feel a slight bit of limitation in the skills sections. Playing with your friends is fun my only complaint on that would be how when someone activates a quest or an NPC (that isnt a shop) that everyone is paused and focussed in on what that player's interaction is with said NPC. It would be an interesting twist to make it flow normally while such an event is going on. I.E. other players can still move around and do things as an option. This way it adds a little more depth to the story telling by requiring that player to relay information to other characters who may not be near that NPC or even in that room.\n\nCombat difficulty is kinda dependant on a few things. one your build, two if you have help, and three the campaign or mission you're running (or more specifically the stats on the monster or monsters you're fighting). While I can't say you can't build and OP build I don't think this is the type of game that you can really be successful at running solo. Hence the inclusion of the NPC characters that you can summon (or better yet bringing your friends in to help).","December 30, 2015","true","73.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

The game has a great action packed campaign with endearing characters, hilarious witty banter, plenty of side quests, fantasic voice acting, and the promise of even more features on the way. I believe this game does as much justice to the classic table top D&D as it advertises and with each update gets closer and closer to the real thing. What I think I love most of all though is the unfailing loyalty of the developers. They have taken the time to polish everything before releasing updates, and if a glitch occurs, they work tirelessly to fix the problem. In a day and age where most companies have been releasing only part of a game and charging left and right for dlcs that barely add any content, it's like a breath of fresh air to see SCL's developers actually care more about what the players want than making money. For the intial payment, players are given the campaign story, full access to multiplayer functions, the ability to dm, and a new dlc coming out that will add another class, race, and story to the game. Any other company would have split as many of these things up into separate packages to make more money, but they didn't. n-Space is doing everything they can to give the players what they want for a fraction of the price. For that I say thank you n-Space, and you can count on me being a loyal costumer in the future.

I can also say that if the Devs update and fix some of the outstanding issues, this game would be incredible.  First I'll start with "The Bad" something has to be done about the in-game map, in-game camera, and in-game  quest journal.   The in-game map doesn't scroll.. plan and simple because there's nothing more frustrating than needing to travel the other end of the zone, but the map doesn't show you  far off parts of the map furthermore you cannot scroll in or out, not to mention horizontally either. The in game camera is also just as bad because it will leave you at odd angels unable to zoom in or out. I would also be aware the camera height changes as you travel through environments and it can break immersion and be very awkward at times. Last of the bad has to do with the game's quest journal which could use more detail for explaining your quest, and completed quests should be removed or placed on a separate page from the active quests, but  this is just my personal preference.\n"The Good"  straight-up the environments are gorgeous, the game runs extremely smooth on my system, and it's really a D&D "type" game, but some hardcore enthusiast may not agree. They really do capture the spirit of the old PC adventure games, plus it has a nice feeling which will open the nostalgia floodgates. I look forward to seeing how the developers go about correcting the bugs as well as adding new content.   I can honestly recommend this game because I believe there is a bright future for this title, and to sum it up I had fun, but then again your mileage may vary.","March 1","true","86.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It does play in the D&D verse though.\nThe setting reminds me of the "Neverwinter Nights"-Series, I guess that was intended by the producer.\nSo if you are striving after a new Baldurs Gate, this game will definitively not satisfy you.\n\nThe fighting-system reminds me of the "Dragon Age"-Series. Each class do get a lineup of different skills, which can be upgraded over time. There are not much skill-trees to specialise in, and most trees only better the skill-version of the previous one. Again: If you are looking for a genuine D&D game with multiclassing etc, you would have to look elsewhere. On the other side: This does make the game really easy, because it is nearly impossible to misallocate your skill-points. Even the highest difficulty is cushy with the pause-function and tons of potions and scrolls.\n\nGraphics are acceptable for an online-game, though it does feature a single player campaign which can be done via co-op or in offline-mode. Sound and music are like the story mediocre, but I have seen worse: You fall prey to a conspiracy and are just able to escape with your life, only to find out, that your old life is over and that you will have to look for new allies in order to stay alive long enough to find out why you are warranted for death. Nothing new here, but some really precious games used the same approach, so nothing to whinge about.\n\nOne could say that there is not much customisation, like crafting, implemented. Most Role-Play-Games nowadays, even those without a D&D label, offer more in terms of crafting etc, but again this one likes to keep it simple. The dungeon master mode is still in the early stages and needs much improvement to offer as much fun as real editors, like the ones for the "Elder Scrolls"-Series, or a pen&paper-game with friends.\n\nThis small and simple game surely is not the pinnacle of RPG-artistry, but it does not deserve such a bad rating solely based on the fact, that it is not the D&D game as advertised. It is a simple game, but not a bad one. Well worth 10 €.","December 22, 2015","true","85.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

If you're getting it for the story and multi player through said story then it's prety awesome.\n\nI pre ordered this game with great hopes and dreams, those dreams were crushed.  For starters I saw a Tiefling NPC after knowing I can't make a Tiefling character.... what the hell?  You can't even make a Half-Orc or a Dragonborn, I mean come on people this is 5e, get with it.\n\nThe game is great for a while but there's only so much to do and while there seems to be great promise in the fact that there's endless player made content, the reality is very harsh.  If you play through the story - which is great by the way - you'll think to yourself, "Wow I'll bet there's some amazing player made content out there given what you can do with this game!"  But no, because the creation tools in the game are extremely limited.  For instance you can make a custom NPC to give a quest sure, you can even give them abilities and stats and what not but.. why exactly?  No idea but back on topic it's very simplified.  The most detail you can have is talk to the NPC, get a one page explanation of what they want and either accept the quest or not.  You can't even alter what you can say to them at all, it's either "We accept!" or "Not right now."  You can't have any diologue or anything.  You also can't have events triggered either, like "Say this to that guy and he attacks you" for instance is impossible which was very disappointing.  Long story short if you get this game thinking the ability to create content will be awesome then don't do it.\n\nThe story is awesome, so if that's what you want the game for then get it.  There's a lot of fun interactions with characters, banter between them and what not, some great reactions to things you can say and sometimes there's that NPC you want to just tell "why don't I beat it out of you?" and you actually can!  So it's a lot of fun.\n\nGameplay there's nothing really new, just updated graphics and mechanics of previous games like this one. (Baldur's Gate being an example)  I really love how the traps are in this game and the search skill in general is very user friendly.  I should also mention that abilities are all on cooldowns, there's no "you need to rest to get your spells back" or anything of the sort.  Not sure how I feel about that.\nAnother thing that will likely ♥♥♥♥ off a lot of fans of D&D is death in this game... there's like no penalty at all, not even the things you were fighting healing up unless a healer is present.  You just die, respawn nearby and keep at it until they're dead.  As far as I can tell you lose absolutely nothing.  Not to mention you can stabilize people in combat!  There's no "dead" status, only "downed" so there's not even a need for revive spells even though they are there.\n\nAll in all I think the game is good but not great.  Get it on sale or wait for a serious update to the DM tools that will likely never come.  I do recommend it because it is fun, especially multi player.  Beyond the story though there's nothing worth having here so go into it knowing that.","October 26, 2015","true","34.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I left a review but deleted it after playing the game a while longer because it turned out to be an enjoyable game after giving it a chance.\n\nBottom line is if you're looking for a computer version of D&D you've definitely come to the wrong place but if you're looking for a party-based arcade RPG in a D&D setting this game can be lots of fun.\n\nIn my opinion Temple of Elemental Evil is the most accurate computer version of D&D and it's actually enjoyable to play now that the community has fixed the problems with the bug-ridden original release.  Baldur's Gate 2 stands for me as the most immersive computer version of D&D.  I'm an older player who still remembers those magical Gold Box games and I'd say Baldur's Gate 2 is still as close as you'll get to that.  This is nowhere near as good as any of those games.\n\nThis game is closer to Neverwinter Nights with a Diablo feel to it.  The combat is arcade instead of tactical and character development is also really straightforward.   The interface feels designed for a console and is terrible on the PC but it gets the job done.\n\nYour adventurers are truly stalwart in this game!  They never die and you never have to rest.  No spells to memorize or use-per-day abilities or anything like that.  It's simple and easy to learn.\n\nOn the plus side:\n- I love the mechanics around searching, hiding and finding/removing traps.\n- The story of the main single player game is great and keeps me interested.  It's mostly linear but there's a few interesting sub-plots here and there.\n- There's lots of voice acting and you'll hear quite a few funny remarks from your party members.\n- The graphics and sound are good and performance is fine.\n- Inventory management is real easy and they included encumbrance which makes managing your inventory a little more interesting.\n- I don't seem to have run into any bugs and the game has never crashed or become sluggish on me.  The last attempt at a computer D&D game I purchased was Temple of Elemental Evil and it was an awesome computer translation of D&D but was completely undermined by an unbelievable number of bugs on release.  This one is far from a computer translation of D&D but doesn't seem to have any major bugs.\n\nAnd a few negatives:\n- In combat you basically go into 'arcade mode' with special ability cooldowns and you can't die.  The AI is good enough that you can usually let the computer take care of combat but it can also get annoying if you decide to control the characters in an encounter.  Combat is mostly lacking in tactics.\n- Character progression is about as simple as it gets.  There's a few new abilities here and there but you mostly just 'level' up your existing abilities.  It's not like D&D where your abilities get stronger as you level up  - instead of a mage adding a D6 to their fireball up to a certain level, if you want a stronger fireball you use a skill point to purchase "fireball level 2" at level up.  You get 3 points to use at each level up with new abilities costing 2 (or sometimes all 3) skill points and ability level ups costing one point.\n- The interface is annoying but you get used to it.  For example if you want to open your inventory with the mouse you can't just right click on a character portrait.  Instead you have to either press a button on the keyboard (or a controller, which is what this game was probably designed for) or click on the menu icon then hit the inventory tab.   To pan the map you have to hold down the middle mouse button instead of just moving the mouse pointer to the edge of the screen.\n- Not being able to die and the lack of resting really takes away from the immersion.  I never really feel attached to any of my characters because I know there's never any risk.\n- The need to create an account before playing the game is just plain dumb.\n\nOverall I didn't buy it after the free play expired but decided to scoop it when they extended the discount.  At the full price I'd be disappointed but the 50% off made it worthwhile and i'm hopeful it'll be fun to pop into for random dungeon crawls and player-created content down the road.\n\nNot in the same league as a Baldur's Gate or even a Temple of Elemental Evil.  It's probably on par with Neverwinter Nights and maybe even a little more fun (but much less D&D-like)\n\nMy first impression was a 5 or a 6 out of ten, then after playing the free weekend I upped it to a 6.5 or a 7, now after sticking with it for a while I'd up it to a 7.5.  With tactical combat and an implementation of the D&D ruleset this would be an awesome game.","January 7","true","62.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

The story is rich and deep.  I found the graphics immersive.  I'm a big fan of Dungeons and Dragons and this game makes me feel thats what I'm doing, adventuring in a beautiful fantasy world.  The companions are interesting with good stories.  Its worth knowing each of them.  Their value is increased further because if you can complete their personal quest, their special skill tree can be accessed by all your characters of the appropriate class from that point on.  I love the tactical battles, they bring back the best of Neverwinter Nights and Dragon Age: Origins.  Being able to pause in the middle of the fight is so useful.  The abilities, classes, races, and monsters do a splendid job of combining 4th and 5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons.  Dungeon delving is a great way for me to get in a D&D kick when I don't have much time or just feel like wondering around challenging monsters and hunting treasure.  All the companions you've got to join you in the story mode also become available in dungeon delving, allowing you to make some interesting parties.  And I have yet to start all these wonderful modules people have been making!  This game will hold my attention for a long time.  I rate it up there with other great rpgs like Neverwinter Nights and Dragon Age: Origins.  The load times between areas can be rough, but I feel its worth it to enjoy this game.

If you're getting it for the story and multi player through said story then it's prety awesome.\n\nI pre ordered this game with great hopes and dreams, those dreams were crushed.  For starters I saw a Tiefling NPC after knowing I can't make a Tiefling character.... what the hell?  You can't even make a Half-Orc or a Dragonborn, I mean come on people this is 5e, get with it.\n\nThe game is great for a while but there's only so much to do and while there seems to be great promise in the fact that there's endless player made content, the reality is very harsh.  If you play through the story - which is great by the way - you'll think to yourself, "Wow I'll bet there's some amazing player made content out there given what you can do with this game!"  But no, because the creation tools in the game are extremely limited.  For instance you can make a custom NPC to give a quest sure, you can even give them abilities and stats and what not but.. why exactly?  No idea but back on topic it's very simplified.  The most detail you can have is talk to the NPC, get a one page explanation of what they want and either accept the quest or not.  You can't even alter what you can say to them at all, it's either "We accept!" or "Not right now."  You can't have any diologue or anything.  You also can't have events triggered either, like "Say this to that guy and he attacks you" for instance is impossible which was very disappointing.  Long story short if you get this game thinking the ability to create content will be awesome then don't do it.\n\nThe story is awesome, so if that's what you want the game for then get it.  There's a lot of fun interactions with characters, banter between them and what not, some great reactions to things you can say and sometimes there's that NPC you want to just tell "why don't I beat it out of you?" and you actually can!  So it's a lot of fun.\n\nGameplay there's nothing really new, just updated graphics and mechanics of previous games like this one. (Baldur's Gate being an example)  I really love how the traps are in this game and the search skill in general is very user friendly.  I should also mention that abilities are all on cooldowns, there's no "you need to rest to get your spells back" or anything of the sort.  Not sure how I feel about that.\nAnother thing that will likely ♥♥♥♥ off a lot of fans of D&D is death in this game... there's like no penalty at all, not even the things you were fighting healing up unless a healer is present.  You just die, respawn nearby and keep at it until they're dead.  As far as I can tell you lose absolutely nothing.  Not to mention you can stabilize people in combat!  There's no "dead" status, only "downed" so there's not even a need for revive spells even though they are there.\n\nAll in all I think the game is good but not great.  Get it on sale or wait for a serious update to the DM tools that will likely never come.  I do recommend it because it is fun, especially multi player.  Beyond the story though there's nothing worth having here so go into it knowing that.","October 26, 2015","true","34.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The game isn't bad.  It is more like Dragon Age than Baldur's Gate.  There isn't much for party strategy.  What I find annoying is the map system.  In almost all previous D&D titles you could open the map, click anywhere and go.  Not in this game.  You can't leave little notes on the map either.  The interface doesn't seem complete either.  You should be able to do almost everything you need with the mouse.  There are a lot of key bindings that aren't represented with the click and point of a mouse.  Just my own peeve I suppose.\n\nIMO this is a better game than POE.  The lore alone makes it so.  The game designers could have done so much more though.\n\nIf you are a fan of the Forgotten Realms than this game is worth it.\n\nAnd my last critique... I am not a fan of the 5th Generation ruleset.   I've been playing D&D since 1978 and my love will always be Basic through 2nd Edition Advanced.\n\n100+ hours in and this game has me hooked still.

It really gave me a nostalgic playthrough looking back to when I played Neverwinter Nights 1 and 2. The gameplay is easy to pick up and although I'm playing on 'easy' difficulty, there was a few times early on that i had to reload and re-assess several monster fights. The game's story progresses well and it's funny to listen to some of the banter from the companions.\n\nOne great feature is when a storyline depends on the presence of a particular companion but that companion isn't in your current party, the game dialogue includes that character's dialogue. This is similar to in Star Wars: The Old Republic when someone who you are partied with has their hologram teleported to you to be part of the conversation. It saved me having to change the party to include the relevant character where they ordinarily don't add to my party's strengths.\n\nHaving now completed the main story, my only gripe is that sometimes the quest markers work and sometimes they don't. When they don't it can be a frustrating time trying to work out/remember where the quest npcs are located. Some of the fights are tough and require some good strategic use of class skills as opposed to just tanking and spanking, so very much enjoyed the difficulty of the game even on easy.\n\nThe developers have just released a new DLC pack so will be hitting that very soon. Highly recommend this game for D&D and RPG enthusiasts.","December 28, 2015","true","31.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

I can also see that it's not nearly as strict of a D&D game as most previous ones. However, it's still a very enjoyable game. No, you don't level your character in the same way as you do on paper, you don't have access to the same spell library, etc., but all in all, I think that this is a pretty decent adaptation of D&D 5 to the PC.\n\nHowever, if I could "fix" one thing, it would be the combat. The cooldown idea is actually pretty cool, and adeptly blurs the line between real time and a game turn. That said, I still don't understand why auto-pause after each round isn't the default, and I find that it's tricky to make my player stay put in ranged combat (I tend to play casters, so this is a bit of problem; I don't want to go rushing into the fray, but rather fire off stuff from a distance).\n\nMinor annoyances aside, I think this is looking like a very enjoyable game.

I don't play PnP, but I have played D&D CRPGs off and on going back to the Gold Box series.\n\nThe DM tools are somewhat limited for module-making, but allow for amazing emergent gameplay when live-DMing. The developer appears to be continuing to refine them, though, so I expect module-making to become more robust over time.\n\nPlaying is a joy from an tactical ARPG standpoint. Cooldowns took a bit to get used to, but as the characters grow and abilities are unlocked, they become more satisfyingly complex.\n\nMultiplayer works out really good in this system -- the only D&D game I've played in multiplayer more (besides DDO) is Neverwinter Nights 1, mainly because of its user-created persistent worlds.

I have to give it a thumbs up for that ... for the developers ... for the D&D aspects.  The game takes a huge hit (almost to the point of sucking) because of the community that plays it.  About 1 out of every 20 playing a multi-player discoverable game actually want to play multi player and the rest will kick you out for joining them.  Yet another 1 out of every 5 are actually even playing, the rest have left their game open and walked away.  The game defaults to the host for conversations ... so god forbid you join one and the guy is afk ... youre stuck in a conversation screen that cant be exited or over ridden and you end up haveing to 'End Task' to get out and start the game over.  The only saving grace in all of this is that because you have to login to play ... they have built in that you get kicked off the server for inactivity ... so thats a plus.  But whos going to wait around for a host to get kicked for that?  And you dont get to take over the game when a host leaves either unfortunately, it just ends it for everyone involved.  Very sucky.\n\nAs a rule:  Random hosts are generally a-holes, random joins are awesome.  Play the game with friends you already know and dont count on being able to meet anyone new in a lobby and share your love of D&D ... this is not that kind of community at all.\n\nThe single player game (up to where I am at) has so far been your run of the mill D&D experience.

However a quickwitted DM can make up new monsters on the fly and create open-ended (this is important!) quests at a whim.  More types of locations would of course be a plus but I feel confident this will be added to the game in coming releases.  Give this game a try its absolutely worth it for players and DM's alike.","October 28, 2015","true","127.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

Expected fun combat, found slow and too tactical grinding.\n\nThere are 3 options:\n\n1. Cheese (spend ability points as efficiently as possible, have prior knowledge, use broken pathing and npcs to get through fights, stack up on potions, already have characters leveled up, etc) through encounters and wait for invulnerabilities and cooldowns between each room (the wait sucks).\n\n2. Build a character as DPS, Support or Tank with a build that seems like it could work, but be out of cooldowns moments after the battle starts as the characters die in 2-3 hits while not doing much damage... then have tedious fights\n\n3. Level up characters in Dungeon Crawl to get unlock skills and have easier time on hard mode.\n\nSure you can get through everything with time by killing enemies in the right order, finally getting enough abilities to easily survive a fight, but it feels more like wasting time than being rewarded for knowing how to fight. I want option 2 to be less tedious and the gameplay to be more balanced so I can't recommend the game right now.\n\nAs for player created content, I tried to make a custom map with custom rooms, but it wasn't possible - rooms are randomly generated.. so I can't recommend this game for that either.","December 18, 2015","false","3.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I really loved the game; felt like a bit of a mix between my two favorite RPGs: Icewind Dale, and Dragon Age Origins. Honestly, nothing makes me happier than northern Faerun, and a rare setting at that, from Luskan to the Evermoors. Great music and atmosphere throughout and lots of humor in-between. It's always nice to go back to a familiar setting, knowing the lore, spells, and what-have-you. Great companions too, as I often had trouble picking which ones I wanted to bring along.\n\nThe main campaign was a good length, taking  about 50 hrs to complete. I played in Offline mode and backed-up my saves every couple of hours out of paranoia. However, I only experienced one bug at the beginning of the game (Belamy never showed up at the bridge), but smooth sailing after that.\n\nAll in all a great experience!

Sword Coast Legends (SCL) is very much like Baldur's Gate: a sort of mix between action RPG and turn-based strategy.  Also, SCL is the newest game in D&D and thus is based on the Version 5 ruleset.  So if you are into all those things regarding SCL, then you will like this game, as I did.\n\nAs far as graphics, sound (including voice acting), storyline, and user interface (UI), the game is great for this genre.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/datus1/recommended/325600/","datus1","loc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/datus1/","63 products in account","Because of the mixed reviews I decided to "try before I buy" and quite honestly I'm having a hard time understanding some of the hate that's being slung at this game.\n\nSome things about myself.  To me the best D&D is still AD&D.   Though I have played every D&D edition up to 5th, I have never played 5th edition.  If I want anything simpler than AD&D I will simply play OD&D.  My opinion of WotC?  The only good thing they ever did was M:TG.  IMO they are incompetent amateurs who have completely butchered the D&D franchise.  I own and still collect AD&D source books, and play regularly.  All this being said, when it comes to video games, I couldn't care less what edition they follow, or how much of a D&D simulator it is.  I'm all about how well it plays as a video game and especially - how functional the multiplayer is.\n\nI was brought up on the Ultima games, and while many in the CRPG community tout the greatness of BG and BG2,  to me they were cumbersome, because rather than focus on making a well functioning video game like Ultima, they decided to basically make a D&D simulator.  Combat was slow, clunky, and gameplay overall was a save/reload fest.  I like those games now more than I did back then because simply, there are no more Ultimas, and you take what you can get within this genre and I think that's why  there's a lot of nostalgia that surrounds those games, but IMO they weren't that great.  I'm also not a fan of Pillars, or Divinity OS.  I think they're way overhyped, but that's another story.\n\nNow as for SCL, if you liked NWN then simply get this game.  It's really not far off (though I can't yet speak for the building tools).  People say SCL is like Diablo?  Not even close!  The itemization is completely different (in fact I can't stand it - but I'm dealing with it), and the comabt is not real-time.  It's not a "hack and slash".  Granted it's not as challenging as BG or BG2 but there are still some tactics you have to follow in order to be successful.  It's not a "do I have enough potions to beat this boss" style ARPGs are - where you just stand  there swinging monotonously.  Don't get me wrong I love ARPGs (Grim Dawn being my current favourite), but this is not an ARPG.  It's streamlined but IMO in a good way.  IMO they are trying to deal with the problems that I have with games like BG and BG2, to make a better D&D style video game - not a simulator.  IMO we don't need another D&D simulator. To me D&D is a social experience meant to be had with friends IRL - a good opportunity to unplug... and if you want to take it to cyberspace just stick with the Aurora toolset.  There's nothing wrong with it and still works perfectly on modern setups.\n\nNow I guess people were hoping this would be a modern Aurora, so I can understand the dissapointment there - I guess.  However, I didn't go into SCL with preconceptions and it's been pretty clear for some time that Shards Online will most likely be the new Aurora... so not sure how anyone was mislead.\n\nOkay.  Now my number one problem with SCL.  Something I think needs serious attention.  The itemization/loot system.  It.is.horrible.   Probably the worst I've ever seen.  They tried to reinvent the wheel, and made it a square.  Seriously ditch the bad idea, please.  One of the GREATEST things about D&D style games is getting that awesome piece of gear.  SCL completely robs you of that excitement.  Almost every piece of gear has a terrible downside, so nothing you get feels awesome.  WTH?  Is this a 5th edition thing or someone's "bright idea"?  It's just horrible.  Fix it.\n\nAlso, we need a toggle for the fade to black everytime we talk to an NPC.  It's completely uneccassary and over the course of the game session wastes a LOT of time.  I don't need cutscenes for every conversation.\n\nWe need an option to lock the minimap so it doesn't rotate.  So annoying.\n\nWe need click to move from map screen, and click to position camera from map screen, like NWN.\n\nAlso, cleave with archery?  WTF?\n\nThose are my major gripes right now and I'll keep this review updated as I continue to play.\n\nSo, TL:DR - SCL is good as long as you're not a snob.  It's more like IWD was to BG.  Which IMO is a good thing.  I liked IWD the most out of that era.\n","December 28, 2015","true","64.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/moonrgr/recommended/325600/","moonrgr","[TAW] Serenus Moonlight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/moonrgr/","163 products in account","Sword Coast Legends is a game with clear potential for "light" D&D lovers like me who is interested in D&D's system, but never had a chance to experience it in real life tabletop.Pros:\nDecent graphics: You cannot tilt the camera angle, but from a top-down perspective the graphics is really decent.\nSome smart designs: After the rogue turned on their search skill, there will be a nice circle around them to let you know the range of the searching. Combing with the fact that you can hold down alt to display all interactable objects, this really alleviates the pain in searching for hidden objects in the dungeon.\nHelpful in-game tooptips and implementation of D20 system: Those two factors combined drastically reduced the learning curve and enable you to fine tune your characters without frequently referring to outside sources.\nSmooth gameplay: For my 6.5 hours gameplay, there are no big, game-breaking bugs. Certainly not without minor nuiances (which I will specify below), but the gameplay is generally a smooth experience.Cons:\nNo action queue in combat: This is the single biggest game breaker. The game do have a decent auto-pause system that let you pick pricisely when do you want the game to pause (and offers a handful of options as well). However, you are essentially forced to be constantly pausing your game, not for pivoting your combat strategies, but for the sake of imitating a action queue. For instance, as a ranger I would like to execute the following sequence of actions: go into stealth, mark my target, attack twice, and heal my pet. To execute it, I have to first set the in-game option to pause whenever I finish the casting of an abilities, then wait the game to pause whenever I finished the previous ability, and then pick the next one and wait for another pause in a split second. This can get really tedious and let you constantly question how could the developers miss such a basic feature.\nLack of basic logistics features: There is literally only one save slot available and you cannot save in a dungeon. The latter is not necesarrily a bad thing as it can actually promote more careful gameplay, but for the former, I've been reading some horror story in the forum where a player practically loses all progress they has in a character because a game-breaking bug will appear right after they load that very only save.\nLimitted gameplay features: As a ranger you not only cannot pick what type of pet do you like (you are forced to use a wolf), nor can you name it, but you cannot even command it manually. This causes some frusration as sometimes you would be forced to spawn your pet right before a combat so that it can appear in front of you instead of following you 5 yard behind.I will give this game a positive review because I think this game clearly has its potential if the developer can put more work into it, not adding other gameplay features (pet variation can wait), but add some really needed features like action queue and multiple save slots.\nWith proper updates, Sword Coast Legends can become the first ever serious contender to Never Winter Night 2 ever since the latter was released. To be honest, some negative reviews for this game put too much pressure on this game's inability to imitate a real-world, tabletop D&D 5e experience. In my humble opinion, those players would be better served by a virtual tabletop program. Some features, like spell uses per day, should indeed be removed in a video game.\nUpdate History\n2015/12/20: Initial review.\n2015/12/20: Formatting update.\n2015/12/20: Update to conclusion.","December 20, 2015","true","6.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

Visuals are choppy, the art style is unappealing--almost cartooney--and the voice acting is cringe-worthy. As far as gameplay, it's stable enough, but that's it. Stable *enough*. Throughout the free weekend, I found myself saying repeatedly that it "wasn't that bad" or that some part of it "was okay". In truth, I've realized that as a D&D player and as someone invested in Forgotten Realms, I really wanted this game to be great. But even my rose-tinted Faerunian goggles couldn't make this game better than it really is. It's an underwhelming retro-style almost-isometric RPG that would be a great follow-up to Neverwinter Nights if it hadn't already been done a thousand times better by other companies who make a living beating Wizards at their own game--literally.  Perhaps if Sword Coast Legends came out in 2007, I'd be much more impressed. That's about the year in which this game belongs.\n\nNow, the nerd stuff.\nSword Coast Legends uses the 5th Edition D&D rules. This is both a good thing and a bad thing. 5th Edition rules, I find, are based too much on good DMing and improvisation to be the skeletal structure of a video game. Rolls, modifiers, and skills are not specific enough to support a video game character's actions. That said, it's a refreshing switch, if an uninvited one. However, it brings to mind the question of the game's target audience--because it certainly isn't normal gamers; it's too complicated for that. I didn't play the DM mode, which allows a person to run a game with up to four players as the "DM". This, however, seems limited compared to the game's tabletop equivalent. Am I supposed to go to my D&D group and tell them all to buy a copy of Sword Coast Legends so we can play a game modeled after--and second to D&D itself? Why would they do that? If I have four friends who want to play something like this, why wouldn't we just play D&D?\nIn short, we wouldn't.\nTL;DR ---- Just play D&D. If you want a retro-style RPG, take this $40 that you're about to spend, and spend it on Pillars of Eternity or Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition(s).","December 21, 2015","false","0.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","1"

Modding could fix this, unfortunately the game's DM tools are completely lack luster and modding is all but impossible at the moment. It feels like the developers and their lackies made a game that they want to control, so you only have limited tools, while they get the entire toy box.\n\nIt has all be said by others, but it boils down to this for me, and quite likely for you as well.\n\n1.	As a DnD game, this is pathetic. The pacing is way too fast, there is no balance (not once have I felt at all threatened by the enemies in the campaign) and the dialogue is halting and clunky at best. It lacks key races from any fantasy genera (notably Orcs and Dragons).\n\n2.	As a hack and slash, the game is ok. It mainly consists of clicking on the enemies until they are dead, with almost no skill use except the occasional pause to counter a spell or heal a teammate. The UI is terrible, clicking on anything is clunky and often you misclick and stand there doing nothing while being hit.\n\n3.	The Engine is clunky and ugly. Clicking on anything starts feeling like a chore in the first area, dialogue is invasive taking control of your camera and anyone else playing with you regardless of location. The color pallet consists of greens and browns.\n\n4.	Multiplayer is even more clunky. As every time you talk to someone all players are interrupted to see the dialogue (instead of just posting it in the message box on the lower left, like NWN). You cannot leave an area without all party members, meaning if you have a retentive friend or player that likes to micromanage their inventory, you have to wait for them. It also means every time you click to leave, a dialogue box pops up that will kick them out of their inventory, hilarious once, annoying afterward.\n\n5.	Lastly we come to the one thing that could have redeemed this game, the Toolset. As long as your modding tools are comprehensive enough with a DnD style game, someone will make it work when you utterly fail to do so. Unfortunately here the game again falls flat on its face. In an effort to simplify the tools so that the developer’s young children could use it, they stripped the toolset of every possible usable functionality.\n\na. You cannot craft dialogue trees without getting creative and making your game endlessly clunky. Every quest or quest action you can write a single sentence or two before you hit character limits then the PC only has the option of a yes/no response. To make a dialogue tree, you have to make a separate quest action for every single sentence, requiring the players to click multiple times to continue a conversation. Yet the engine is clearly capable of supporting dialogue trees, as they are present in the main game.\n\nb. Quest rewards are randomized; you cannot pick a specific reward for players.\n\nc. DM character creator is limited, you do not have full control over stats, equipment or even colors when it comes to monsters. This is great if your used to bad DM’s that overpower all their characters because ‘mine’ but terrible if you’re a good DM and just want the freedom to tweak until your happy.\n\nd. Quests can only be bound to objects or characters, you cannot place a trigger just on the ground to be stepped on. Quests also can only be triggered by clicking the object.\n\ne. Exterior Maps are ‘random’ but they are not. Maps are pre built, with between 2-5 variations many of them just small areas, like a glade in the woods. This makes for tiresome tweaking to try and make each outdoor area feel different, while using the same map(s) over and over again.\n\nf. Dungeons are random (yay) but the templates for them are just boring, brown and ugly. Still suffering from the same problems as the rest of the game.\n\nIn the end, I cannot recommend this game, my brother and I purchased it to play a good old DnD CRPG and it got boring in the first half hour, we plugged on for another two before agreeing to return our copies. Modding will not fix it unless the developer can/wants to open up hood and give the users the full toolbox.\n","October 22, 2015","false","8.0"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

After the character creation which has a decent amount of information, the game itself seems lacking from an "I'm an additional player, not the host" perspective. We're given little to no information on why we're doing what we're doing. The loot, at the bare minimum should be interesting and engaging - that's essentially our reason for going forward since we're not given any information. It fails here...\n- Weapons seem to have bare basic names. "Quarter Staff", "Broadsword", etc. It doesn't matter the quality - even colored items have this fatal flaw.\n- It is difficult to compare stats on items. I figured most games had this nailed down at this point, but two side-by-side windows is best here...\n- Difficulty curve is insane. It's almost as if there's no control here, just "they're progressing at x speed, increase difficulty by y amount." It doesn't work, and it's really unsatisfying.\n- The classes seem to be lacking a form of balance. I mean, early on - you're better off using a ranger as a healer then having a cleric with you. They heal just as fast, for about the same (it seemed like even more healing then my cleric was doing), and can output more damage.\n\nI'll be honest, I did not get to try the dungeon master mode - but at the same time, I don't care. I'm not invested in the game enough to even bother opening it again.\n\nIn it's current state, if it were on sale for $5-10, it would be a "MAYBE" purchase from me - MAYBE if I had 4 friends, 3 to play with and a DM - but definitely not solo. This is in NO way a $19.99 game on discount, and DEFINITELY NOT a $39.99 game. I don't know what's in the Digital Deluxe edition (once again, I'll be honest - I don't care enough to look), but if I wouldn't pay $19.99 for this game, there's no way I'd pay $29.99 or $59.99 for it.\n\nSeems more and more D&D is lending it's brand to games that don't deserve it. I truly hope they don't mistake the poor reviews and what not as a direct correlation to their product, but the game.","December 18, 2015","false","1.4"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

You cannot leave an area without all party members, meaning if you have a retentive friend or player that likes to micromanage their inventory, you have to wait for them. It also means every time you click to leave, a dialogue box pops up that will kick them out of their inventory, hilarious once, annoying afterward.\n\n5.	Lastly we come to the one thing that could have redeemed this game, the Toolset. As long as your modding tools are comprehensive enough with a DnD style game, someone will make it work when you utterly fail to do so. Unfortunately here the game again falls flat on its face. In an effort to simplify the tools so that the developer’s young children could use it, they stripped the toolset of every possible usable functionality.\n\na. You cannot craft dialogue trees without getting creative and making your game endlessly clunky. Every quest or quest action you can write a single sentence or two before you hit character limits then the PC only has the option of a yes/no response. To make a dialogue tree, you have to make a separate quest action for every single sentence, requiring the players to click multiple times to continue a conversation. Yet the engine is clearly capable of supporting dialogue trees, as they are present in the main game.\n\nb. Quest rewards are randomized; you cannot pick a specific reward for players.\n\nc. DM character creator is limited, you do not have full control over stats, equipment or even colors when it comes to monsters. This is great if your used to bad DM’s that overpower all their characters because ‘mine’ but terrible if you’re a good DM and just want the freedom to tweak until your happy.\n\nd. Quests can only be bound to objects or characters, you cannot place a trigger just on the ground to be stepped on. Quests also can only be triggered by clicking the object.\n\ne. Exterior Maps are ‘random’ but they are not. Maps are pre built, with between 2-5 variations many of them just small areas, like a glade in the woods. This makes for tiresome tweaking to try and make each outdoor area feel different, while using the same map(s) over and over again.\n\nf. Dungeons are random (yay) but the templates for them are just boring, brown and ugly. Still suffering from the same problems as the rest of the game.\n\nIn the end, I cannot recommend this game, my brother and I purchased it to play a good old DnD CRPG and it got boring in the first half hour, we plugged on for another two before agreeing to return our copies. Modding will not fix it unless the developer can/wants to open up hood and give the users the full toolbox.\n","October 22, 2015","false","8.0"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

After the character creation which has a decent amount of information, the game itself seems lacking from an "I'm an additional player, not the host" perspective. We're given little to no information on why we're doing what we're doing. The loot, at the bare minimum should be interesting and engaging - that's essentially our reason for going forward since we're not given any information. It fails here...\n- Weapons seem to have bare basic names. "Quarter Staff", "Broadsword", etc. It doesn't matter the quality - even colored items have this fatal flaw.\n- It is difficult to compare stats on items. I figured most games had this nailed down at this point, but two side-by-side windows is best here...\n- Difficulty curve is insane. It's almost as if there's no control here, just "they're progressing at x speed, increase difficulty by y amount." It doesn't work, and it's really unsatisfying.\n- The classes seem to be lacking a form of balance. I mean, early on - you're better off using a ranger as a healer then having a cleric with you. They heal just as fast, for about the same (it seemed like even more healing then my cleric was doing), and can output more damage.\n\nI'll be honest, I did not get to try the dungeon master mode - but at the same time, I don't care. I'm not invested in the game enough to even bother opening it again.\n\nIn it's current state, if it were on sale for $5-10, it would be a "MAYBE" purchase from me - MAYBE if I had 4 friends, 3 to play with and a DM - but definitely not solo. This is in NO way a $19.99 game on discount, and DEFINITELY NOT a $39.99 game. I don't know what's in the Digital Deluxe edition (once again, I'll be honest - I don't care enough to look), but if I wouldn't pay $19.99 for this game, there's no way I'd pay $29.99 or $59.99 for it.\n\nSeems more and more D&D is lending it's brand to games that don't deserve it. I truly hope they don't mistake the poor reviews and what not as a direct correlation to their product, but the game.","December 18, 2015","false","1.4"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

It's a solid game for the price.  It's not mind blowing, but the gameplay is fun, and I've been having a blast crafting a campaign from the minute details of the plot to creating little personal flourishes, like a rat that is also an armed explosion trap ready to blow up anybody who touches said rat without first disaming it.\n\nOh, you wanted a faithful recreation of D&D that you can play online, with friends?  There's no video game on earth which currently exists that can replicate tabletop gaming.  Go sign up for roll20 if that's what you want.\n\nSword Coast Legends is a good game with gameplay that hovers somewhere between Diablo and Baldur's Gate II.\n\nThe only complaint I have is the absolute randomization of dungeon layouts and loot (You can absolutely fill a dungeon however you want to, but have no say over what players get for completing a quest - i.e. they can be rewarded "Random Weapon," "Random armor," or "Random Trinket.")  but even then, it still works for what it is.\n\nIn the end, almost all of the issues with the game feel like minor complaints when you're crafting a serious questline about a fallen paladin's quest to get revenge on the order that spurned him to share with friends and strangers (and dropping booby-trapped rats into some inconspicuous corners along the way.)","October 25, 2015","true","20.6"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

This is what I have found so far. The campaign is fun, a good D & D style romp. Good quests, nice story and good voice acting.\n\nOver all a solid 8 out of 10 for me for single player.\n\nNow for the multi-player. Love the DM mode just wish we had more control over what the players were doing and bringing in, like being able to look at the character sheets and inventory to see if they are cheaters. Need more control over loot for sure, Ninja Looting abounds in pickup groups.\n\nThey told us that they were holding alot back from the multiplayer side to avoid spoiling the campaign, turns out the community was either being unrealistic on their expectations for what was coming or we were mislead by developers. There was not much more released from the head starts. NO NEW MONSTERS even some that are in the campaign are missing (DRAGONS anyone). NO NEW ITEMS again even tho there are tons more in the campaign. None of the additions that people were asking for on the forums were added, that I can see.\n\nLooking at about a 6 out of 10 for multiplayer as a module builder. 8 out of 10 as a DM or Player going thru a Module.\n\nBUT IT COULD BE SO MUCH MORE! The base is there just need the additions and polish.\n\nReally hoping the developers continue to support the game and make it great not just grab their money and run..........................","October 20, 2015","true","28.8"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

If you enjoyed classic crpgs of the past like Baldur's Gate/IWD/NWN series then you should give this a try. It apparently goes for the 5e D&D ruleset (which I know practically nothing about) but it does takes some liberites from what I can tell. I'll start with the pros then cons.\n\nPros:\n-Single player campaign is pretty interesting as far as I got, I think I might actually complete it, unlike NWN OC which I got bored of by the end of chapter 2 lol (Modules was where that game shined). The story is interesting, and the npcs who join you along the way are humorous as well.\n-I like the combat, sure it doesn't feel that close to pnp what with ability cool-downs and such. But it works well imo. I have no idea how 5e plays so maybe it works that way, all i know is you dont have to rest after every couple combats to reset your spell books.\n-Player made modules can be downloaded from within the game. And there are already hundreds of them to choose from. Downloading player made content has never been easier (I cant stand steam workshop because every time a game updates mods break your game until they are updated)\n-For something different you can play randomly generated dungeon crawls where you have quite a bit of control on what it will consist of but not limited to: your objectives, and enemy types, the tile set used, how many floors and if there will be a boss. Really simple to figure out.\n-I never tried DM mode or creating a module but from some youtube videos I looked at it appears to be pretty intuitive. I think I could even manage it and I have never created custom content for a game. But at the cost of that, it may limit what you can do if you are very experienced at such things (dont go in expecting nwn tooleditor at least not yet anyways). Devs keep adding features to this as time goes by.\n-You get a persistant camp with a stash that you can visit during your adventures. The chest is really nice because you can swap items between characters with it.\n\n\nCons:\n-This may not effect most people but I cant seem to keep a solid 60fps, I meet and excede the recommended specs but occasionally the frames drop. mostly in large areas or areas that have particle effects like snow falling etc. It is still totally playable for me, just breaks immersion a bit. Not sure if its an issue on my end or if its unity engine related.\n-Many of the down votes are due to the fact that you have to sign up for a 3rd party account. Really not a big deal, it takes you 3 minutes tops, and bang your playing the game. You can at least opt out of the email updates if you want.\n-Character creation is kind of limited in comparison to older D&D based games. You get the main races like Human (theres actually 2 sub race selections for this) elf, half-elf, dwarf, and halfling. Each with at least a couple sub races except for half elf. So no gnomes or tieflings yet but possibly in an update. They did just add drows apparently so you can get your Drizzt on if thats your thing. Also the classes are lacking, you get your basics but theres so much more I think we all want to see, like Warlocks, Monks, Bards, Druids, and Barbarians to name a few.\n-Skill trees... yea instead of your usual feat/skill progression like in previous dnd games you get skill trees for each class. Think Dragon Age Inquisition basically. That is not necessarily a bad thing but it could really be improved upon.\n-All in all this game is pretty streamlined, anyone could pick this game up with no knowledge of D&D or rulesets. A con no doubt for D&D vets but probably good news for people new to it.\n\nUnfortinately I cant say anything about MP because I only played single player so far, but what I know is you can have 4 players with or without a 5th as a DM. You can play the campaign with friends or try other modules or do some random dungeon diving. thats about all I know about it.\n\nAnyways this was my first review, I felt that this game deserves a some more possitive reviews. Thats what I think anyways. I played for the free weekend and then bought it, I think this game is worth a buy if you enjoy these types of games. Thats my 2 cents, have a good one!","December 21, 2015","true","33.6"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

Games aren't on cartridges or CD's and are no longer fully featured. The landscape has changed, get over it. After these last two community packs, most of the reviewers have stated that they like it now but still refuse to recommend it because the devs have to earn their trust. So, listening to the community and publishing packs to answer their feedback DOESN'T earn your trust? Get over yourself.\n\nSecondly, this is a video game, not a pen and paper game. I too am a long fan of pen and paper games and am a GM. You know what else wasn't like its pen and paper cousin? Neverwinter Nights 1&2. Nor was Baldur's Gate, or The Temple of Elemental Evil because video games will never be able to fully emulate our imaginations.\n\nThirdly, for a dungeon crawler that evokes the feel of a pen and paper game (but isn't fully one), this game is fun. It isn't perfect, nor is any other game, but I found the DM controls easy to use and don't require a PHD in game design in order to have fun. The gameplay feels pretty much like any other dungeon crawler, which is a win to me, because if something isn't broken, it doesn't need to be fixed.\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game, as a gamer of 23 years and a tabletop gamer of 14 years. It's not perfect, but hey, $20 is nothing compared to some of the garbage for which you pay $60. If you like dungeon crawlers and want it to be skinned as D&D, buy it. :)","January 31","true","3.6"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

The 4+1 multiplayer dungeon crawling is good fun, especially as the dungeon master can alter monsters, the environment, traps etc. in real-time.\n\nDM tools are quite nice, but I'd like more freedom and a free-form tile editor would be good, as well as the ability to make branching dialogue when making NPCs.\n\n\nTHE BAD:\n\nThe graphics are nice, but not nice enough to lower the frame rate of my highly powered rig to about 15 fps at max settings. I get ~35 fps on The Phantom Pain on maximum settings, to put it in perspective.\n\nThe combat is just very slightly clunky. I'm not really sure how to describe it! Baldur's Gate is so smooth with how it deals with abilities, and I feel when I play this that I am expecting it to be a little more responsive, but that could just be my subliminal preference.\n\nTree system is a bit weird and maybe gives each character class too many choices, but this decision may have been made because there is no multi-classing.\n\nThe prologue is not good.... It is alright. Okay. Fine..... But that's it. If I wasn't confident I'd really like the game from previously playing Sword Coast legends I may be writing an entirely different review. It is far too linear and a little bland.\n\n\n\nMy problem with other reviews is that most of the very harsh reviews are from reviewers that have played 1-2 hours. This is not enough time to really appreciate the game and I imagine most haven't even finished the prologue yet.\n\n\nAs a die-hard D&D fan and player 9/10, as an average gamer 8/10.","October 20, 2015","true","8.9"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

As a long time D&D player from NWN DA:O and Baldurs Gate, this game has a bit of everything. Personally I'm enjoying how they handled the skill trees and adapted the ruleset to this PC Game. It might offend some DnD purists but so far it's enjoyable.\n\nThe party combat AI could use improving. The level editor needs a tileset editor.\n\nBuying just to play the game, I'd give this a 7/10. Buying and seeing the game evolve and all the missing features like orcs, kobolds, better level editor, tileset editor, and some patches to the core gameplay and tools to build worlds for DnD adventures like NWN1 - this game could be a grand successor.\n\nI myself enjoy the graphics and atmosphere, it's well done and suits the genre.

Random Dungeons with some options to set up nice runs even without a Dungeon Master on bord is a big plus.

Though so far all I've heard was that the tools that DM has to create with is very limited. I also find myself wishing for more classes and spells as so me classes feel completely the same (paladin and cleric).\n\nThough this is very dissapointing, I would like to believe that these problems will be updated by the company via DLC/Expansions/update.\n\nI find the Story Mode excellent and enjoyable and with that I see the possibilities of Users creating equally epic works.\n\nI feel that the issues plaguing this game is definitely something that the company will be working on, (especially since everyone made such a big deal about the DM limitations) and that the problems with the limitations on spells and classes is something that future DLC can fix. I think that the game's features is overhyped from what it actually is but I don't think its a horrible game either. I think that the game will definitely live up to its promises after a couple fixes and expansions/updates.\n\nI think its worth it to purchase this game so far. Now if they start making us pay like $10 for a single new class or for a few monsters to create on the DM, I will quickly change my stance just like my experiences with evolve, it was a great game but once it got really microtransactiony I just totally left the game. I'm totally open to purchasing expansion packs and dlc's (though slightly wary of dlc's) which will expand the original game and by buying this game its kind of my way to show support to the company.

Plays like a dumbed-down Diablo 3. If you want the experience you EXPECT, play Pillars of Eternity, Shadowrun: Dragonfall, or (if you want multiplayer) Divinity: Original Sin.\n\nEDIT: Please note that I have spent MANY more hours than are shown in the game - during the Head Start, I spent a great deal of time playing, creating, and trying to DM scenarios and dungeon crawls. I withheld judgment until the proper release.\n\nSword Coast Legends wants desperately to be a modern Baldur's Gate, or perhaps a reinvention of Neverwinter Nights, or some combination. It fails at both.\n\nThe game's entire feel is not that of a D&D session, but more like a squad RTS like one of the Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War series, except that it is tactically banal. The story dialogue and quests are highly simplistic, and often even embarrassingly bad. The NPCs give fetch quests with no context and a backstory that feels like it was improvised and unedited. The characters are one-dimensional, and the world is boring. Gameplay feels like an MMO or (*gag*) even a MOBA, with a hotbar of abilities that cool down in real time.  The skill trees are entirely inventions of the game developers, and have nothing to do with D&D.\n\nWorst of all, the multiplayer story experience is awful. The host controls 3 characters while the guest controls 1, leaving the guest constantly waiting for the host. Loading screens can last for several minutes, and gameplay is more like Diablo than D&D.\n\nMaybe it's unfair that I've recently played Pillars of Eternity, and have trouble avoiding a comparison, but that's the reality of the situation - SCL was released in an environment where the bar was set high, and they are well below it.","October 20, 2015","false","0.9"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

Soooo many potions and food items that give temp boosts it gets a bit ridiculous really lol.\n\nIn summary so far i am enjoying running around in Forgotten realms. I am thinking of it more as a book quest since you can't stray too far from the script. But who cares i am fireballing things. That being said i may change my review in the future as i progress further into the game.","November 7, 2015","true","34.5"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

Its not bad and you can still pause if the settings are there, but its all cooldown based and actiony instead of slow and strategic at times. Not good, not bad, just something to be aware of.\n\nCons: Very limited campaign editor, very limited DM tools, definitely not bug-free, community often gripes that this is not Neverwinter Nights 3 **cough**, extra classes will most likely be sold to me in the form of DLC.\n\nDisclaimer: See that review score up there? Its mostly from folks that thought this was a different game. They spun it up to be something its not and, while the game most definitely has its own problems, I think a lot of people are bitter that they didn't get the game they wanted instead of the game that was made.\n\nGetting single player campaign out of the way, Sword Coast Legends, SCL for the rest of the review, has a pretty lengthy story line and a decent amount of side quests. The game is fun, light hearted for the most part, and the characters reminded me of real DnD characters with their interactions. Nothing groundbreaking here, doing the campaign with a friend is kinda meh, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and thought that so far it justified the price tag on its own. If you're a fan of the genre and are willing to play a game that isn't groundbreaking like D:OS and PoE, you'll probably enjoy yourself.\n\nMultiplayer as a PC is weird. I want to like it very much, but its just not quite there yet. Off the bat, without a DM, the game is just basically boring as all hell in multiplayer right now. The campaign editor is weak (more later) and there's not enough power in the DMs hands to do a whole lot. Dungeon Crawls are great if you're with a group of friends and have a quick DM who can roleplay on the fly to craft small stories out of procedurally generated dungeons. Same with campaigns. If you're not going to play with a DM and you're not interested in playing through story mode, don't get this game.\n\nMultiplayer as DM is both fun and frustrating. Playing as DM is fast paced action in crawls, where you're constantly trying to keep one step ahead of the players while you manipulate content ahead. But the most you can do as a DM is change some doors, lay down some scenery and (lackluster) traps, and spawn more monsters. It is fun if you get a good group of players and it REALLY relies on everyone being able to RP together.\n\nThe campaign editor is the weakest part. It just doesn't feel like you can do much of anything. Instead of giving you lego sets to play with you're given a randomized dollhouse. Yeah, you can decorate it and place things in it and even rename them if you want, custom characters and the like. But there's no triggers (if player opens door then spawn monsters, etc), no custom loot, no scriptable boss fights, no branching dialogue, no custom... almost anything? Campaigns should be designed with a narrator in mind and then just populating the world with flavor text. One more note: This game was never sold as Neverwinter Nights 3. Do not compare NWN and SCL because they had different focuses. I hope all the players that are screaming about it don't give it enough bad press to stop them from getting both campaign editting AND live DMing the support it needs.\n\nSummary: All-in-all, I like the game. Knowing what I know now, I'd probably go back and still buy it again because I like that this genre is coming back. I spent 100 hours playing the game, making spreadsheets with random events of text to copy paste into the game and run stories. But read that for a moment; I was copying text and pasting it into chat as my most significant DM tool. Or spawning Friendly/Neutral monsters and saying "Hey guys, pretend this is ______" SCL has a lot of work ahead of it if it wants to thrive and I hope they can do it.\n","October 20, 2015","true","52.3"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

I think the biggest hurdle is the weight of expectations.  It isn't Baldurs Gate 2 or the like, it isn't Dragon Age: Origins, it isn't (from what others have said) like Neverwinter Nights custom modules.  It also isn't Diablo.  It does have elements of each though, while not being as great as any of them in their strongest points.  I played the custom DM modules before official release and they were fun enough, but I mainly got it for the campaign.  I'm honestly not sure how the game is supposed to be played.  My main strat, which worked well for my preferred party/characters/actors, was to have buffs so I had a fighter with AC and HP party buff, a Paladin with Bless (and Aid- +damage resistance, and HP buff), a rogue with Revellry(?) giving the same buff as Aid-  +damage resistance, and HP buff.  Without these and other HP buffs, early on, it was near impossible.  I was playing on Hard (which had to be selected each time I played) so that may have been it.  However with all those buffs fights rarely needed micromanagement.  Later I got more buffs like the wizard with magic weapon and haste.  The result is that by the end boss, which I read was supposed to have two stages- after their health gets to half, my fighter in particular with 4 attacks each round, critical range through the roof, strength obscenely high, haste, magic weapon, crusaders mantle(+ radiant damage per hit) I watched the final Boss' health drop so fast all I could do was exclaim "Holy ****! Get Rekt!" (very untypical of me and was an exclamation of true amazement and excitement) and he was dead before he could trigger his halfway health stage.  Even if the guide online was erroneous, the point is that I got what I wanted.  I got a game with DnD races and loot, adventuring story, and became a complete bad ♥♥♥.  Ie. I just wanted to equip my guy with better loot and have fun with story and side quests and I did.\n\nThat isn't to say the whole game was a breeze.  I didn't micromanage per se, but focusing down enemies is what worked for me in every situation.  That is except a Mindflayer I encounted and I'm not sure what I was missing but he seemed invlunerable to absolutely everything bar his allies AoE attacks so that might have been the trick or I might be thickheaded and didn't see something there.  Anyway discounting idling and whatnot I got over 50 hours and completed everything.  While I sometimes wished that the buffs didn't have to be reactivated every 60-100 seconds, and things were more tactical like DA:O it is what it is and I had fun.  So if some gameplay videos look decent to you and you can accept that this isn't other games then you may find a fun experience.  I did.","November 25, 2015","true","62.8"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

Combat is just a little bland / clunk but not game breaking, higher difficulty levels increase the fun level i believe. I think the real selling point for this is the modding community, i can see some great modules being made for this, ala NWN. I can only imagine more will be added to the game through DLC which will only benefit it in the long run. I think it's a little to expensive however, would certainly wait until sales if i had my time over. Having just purchased Rebel Galaxy for half the price I feel a little ripped.

They just have to make them mesh together right. It is still worth checking out yourself. :)\n\nsopooo lets get the "cons" out of the way\n\nas a dungeon crawler game...not so much fun...the controls are wonky and wierd. so you have your basic 1 to = spell slot controls, and left click is movement....but the w a s d move your top view map... cool if you didn't have to figure out how to reset it on the fly. which wouldn't be all bad if it werent for the fact that in solo if you click a character that isn't yours, you automatically switch to that character. it needs a few updates to get things right. I would take a page out of Diablo or Path of Exile with thier controls....but i would keep the right click button for map rotation cause i honestly looove that ♥♥♥♥. Unfortuantley when you die you can't skip dialog when you die if you already went through it. I know you want to make sure the main story gets across but if you die and restart at the begining of the main talk...and you have 4 other "main" conversation to go through..UGH.. so a skip dialog would be nice to have unlock if you have gone through it atleast once with the character.\n\nPros\nOMG its D&D but as a game, and you can control a boss against your friend....hehehehehe. it offers a lot of new mechanics which is sweet. making a character is true to D&D style of creation. even includes backgrounds. you have to use a buy in point system. They made it as true to D&D as they possible could which is awesome. I have high hope mainly cause i haven't tried out multiplayer. I made a dungeon, which was fun as hell to do, and played a bit of solo. Solo is cool to learn the lure and game play, and in DM mode, you can just be a mad man putting traps up for all to run through.","November 14, 2015","false","0.8"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

The dungeon crawls were fun, and I'm finding the campaign to be entriguing.\n\nThat said, I'm going based off what I've already experienced, which isn't the full campaign storyline.\n\nI find this to be a lot of fun - and one of the better D&D Forgotten Realms titles in recent years. Is it as good as Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale? No, but it is a faithful return to that kind of story telling. I'm personally not a fan of 5e, so the lack of 5e character class builds is kinda nice for me - my only complaint is a lack of true multi-classing, but you get something similar with the mix and match class tree system. The combat isn't too complicated in the beginning, and abilities can be on long CD's - which can be a bit tedious at times.\n\nGraphically, it needs a little polishing; it's not the most beautiful of games, with a few annoying bugs, but it's better than I expected.\n\nDM mode needs some  tweaking (dungeons are not fully customizable - you can only add in monsters and the like), and I'd like to see Druid and Bard classes added in.\n\nCharacters are well written and I'm enjoying what I've experienced of their storylines, as well as dialogue being a lot of fun. There's been a few laugh out loud moments for me.\n\nIt's obviously drawing influence from the more classic Forgotten Realms titles, as well as a little bit of Diablo, but you can only rehash the isometric rpg game play style so many times before it starts to look like x, y, and z games. If you're expecting something like Neverwinter Nights - sorry, you'll be disappointed, and don't bother pulling out your wallet. If you're looking for a return to the Forgotten Realms and isometric rpg style gaming, this will be worth your time and money - at least much more than certain MMOs out there.","October 20, 2015","true","10.8"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","1"

I ended up with higher blood pressure, throbbing rage-veins, and a strong sense of raw, untargeted hate.\n\nThe game drops you into a tutorial dream sequence set in a flaming building. The smoke and flames make the graphics blurry, so it's hard to see your surroundings while you figure out the controls, including a non-intuitve manual screen rotation to look around walls and such.\n\nThe purpose of the fire is to give the tutorial a sense of urgency, but the opening dialogue kills that immediately. It starts fine-- someone wakes you up to let you know the building is on fire and beset by enemies. The natural response, "oh ♥♥♥♥ I should fight my way out of this burning building," isn't assumed by the game's creators, and you have to go through several painful dialogue steps. I don't remember the exact words, but it's something like:\n\n"Hey wake up, the building is on fire"\n"Oh no, I hate when things are on fire."\n"Haha me too. We're also under attack."\n"Oh man, we should get out of here."\n"Yeah that's a great idea."\n"I agree. See you on the outside."\n"Yes I will see you there."\n\nThe tutorial popups trigger constantly, and after clicking through a mixture of obvious tips and specific information about non-intuitive controls and directives, the game had me navigating up and down a hallway to kill a few baddies. At one point, I missed one, and it didn't let me leave the burning building until I backtracked. There was no red mark, no combat music, nothing to indicate I was in combat, it just needed me to walk back through the smoke to kill a random unimportant character before I could leave the burning building.\n\nThe end of the tutorial had a sweet flaming demon, and I was like "♥♥♥♥ yeah maybe this game doesn't suck," but then I was back into the actual game play and someone was waking me up and talking about their own ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dream and omg it was the same dream let's talk about it. Oh also let's gossip about this character that's outside the camp.\n\nOf the characters, half have thick, grating accents. I think the dwarves were supposed to be scottish and the halflings were supposed to be irish, and the end result was me thinking about scotland and ireland and leprechauns and accents in general and how tolkien wasn't a hack writer and actually developed his own languages to help immerse people in the universe he created.\n\nAfter a tedious filler fight, the game finally let me get a full party together and set out exploring. I was excited to be finally playing the game, and got brutally murdered by the first random pack of wolves I met (still on the same level). "No sweat," I thought to myself. "Guess I'll have to be more careful."\n\nAnd then I was back at the beginning, and a dwarf was telling me about a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dream she had.\n\nDo yourself a favor and pick up Divinity: Original Sin. It's turn-based combat, so it might not be exactly what you're looking for, but it's an excellently made game with great dialogue, interesting combat, intuitive controls, and a good story.\n\nIf that doesn't appeal to you, then replay Baldur's Gate again. Or M&M VI. Or Dragon Age. Or go buy a case of soda. Do anything but give the creators of Sword Coast Legends your time and/or money.","November 16, 2015","false","1.4"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","12","23","2","5"

I felt that if there wasn't a good single-player campaign, I probably would hardly play the game.  I missed, what I considered was, the tactical combat of earlier D&D games like Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale.  This combat just seemed like point and click.\n\nWell the game officially launched, I've played through the campaign, and I must say that I was wrong.  There is a lot of tactical decisions during combate...especially during bosses.  I found myself pausing the game to give each character a specific set of commands for their next action.  It got to the point where I really enjoyed the combat and the AI.\n\nThe biggest achievement for this game, though, is the story.  It's a well written D&D adventure, full of action, heroism, horror, and some laughs; and the voice cast does an amazing job at bringing these characters to life.  By the end of the campaign, I was emotionally invested in the NPCs.\n\nI recommmend this game for anyone looking for a little D&D fun as a solo experience.  Right now, I find the dungeon crawls and DM experience a little lacking.  I'm hoping this is a foundation on which the developers will keep adding stuff.  I see a lot of potential with the player-created content if we're given all the tools that we ask for.","November 25, 2015","true","39.0"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","0"

I think the storyline looks good so far in what i've seen and how its done.\n\nI think the real issue is the new D and D ruleset is not as good as 3.5 or prior.  It doesn't feel like D and D at all.  And the DM stuff doesn't feel like Neverwinter (nor did anyone claim it would be, but I still hoped).  So you will be kind of left hanging, but if you can deal with that I think the game is fun.\n\nJust a note...I find some characters completely unenjoyable to play in this ruleset so it may be worth taking a few stabs at the game with different characters.\n\nThis is a good start for something to build on too...add in more customization for DM's and please find a way to make persistent worlds in the future.","October 20, 2015","true","2.4"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","14","27","0","0"

The newly added Rage of Demons expansion, brings new DM content, new class, new playable race and a cohesive short campaign featuring a lot of lore and albeit short, it's very fun and well built with 3 different factions that offer replayability.\n\nHas it stands right now the Module creation tools are quite limited, but not without reason. The DM tools are meant so that ANYONE can make a quick module and just LIVE RP with friends. It isn't the Aurora toolset and some people do miss that possibility the NWN toolset had, but it's easy to roleplay with a live DM just as you would do on the tabletop (which is the actual intent of the DM tools in this game). I repeat: These are not Dev tools like the aurora toolset but DM tools so understand that you are meant to use them as you'd use your modules on the tabletop! You can pause the game to give lengthy explanations, add your own NPCs both friendly to fight by your side, or neutral to stick around idle and just give you quests or even hostile with spawning hordes of enemies to have your friends fight them! As for playing modules without a DM buddy, they are really well made, playable and full of detail, but need work and expanding the tools will in fact make it an even better experience!\n\nN-Space had promised many times on the forums to expand the content of the game and the tools available, and although they closed shop, as of right now, the game stands perfectly on their own!\n\n\nAs for the original campaign, I have to say it's a really solid cohesive experience that lasts about 40-60 hours depending on how much time you spend doing all the puzzles and side-quests (it has great RPG puzzles!). I played the campaign on hard and had a blast just playing through it. Some people prefer some NPCs to others and that's a good thing! The companions are so detailed that you immediatly make favourites out of them! It lacks some secondary quests, which I wouldn't mind having, being as that would expand the main campaign even further in longevity, but as it stands it's SUPER solid and excellent for cooping with friends (yeah, you can coop booth campaigns with up to 3 more friends!)\n\nI absolutely love cRPGs and this game is definetly between the BIG ones!\n\n9.5/10","October 21, 2015","true","141.0"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","15","29","0","0"

You build a character, add additional members to your party, beat up kobolds at the behest of farmers, take their lunch money, save the world, rinse and repeat.\n\nIn terms of the single player mode, its standard issue adventure that took me about 30 hours to complete with about 90-95% of the quests and items uncovered.   The writing is not breaking any ground, the characters are pleasantly quirky in very predictable ways, the decisions you're asked to make are fairly black & white, you've seen this before.   While the gameplay was enjoyable the story wasn't terribly compelling.  It feels like they wrote standard-issue fantasy tropes on a bunch of sticky notes, plasted them all on a wall, and had someone throw darts while blindfolded.\n\nGameplay is fairly good and while there's a few interface elements that were confusing at first (they expect you to use the keyboard to control the camera) it works out fairly well.   There are a number of bugs and it felt like it was missing a number of usability features that I would have expected for a game that is not breaking any new ground in terms of interface.\n\nI have not tried the multi-player segment with a dungeon master and there's a possibility that the community will provide far more compelling stories than the single player game through mods.   While I don't recommend it right now it might be worth it in six months when they make some updates and the modder community gets an opportunity to write some content (or port games over from old Neverwinter mods).","November 11, 2015","false","34.3"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","16","31","0","0"

It is still a really solid and easy to use system. I can understand that people are dissapointed in the lack of control over the maps, however who really enjoyed having to build everything manually in Neverwinter Nights? It took such a long time to make anything worthwhile.\n\nThe DM mode with Dungeon Crawl is still solid, it is fun and something you can just jump into and enjoy, it is however just a bonus. What really matters in this game is the Story mode and this is where this game shines. It shines like a buffed up baldspot in the setting sun. It is the first game, in its genre,  since Baldur´s Gate 2 to really drag me in and keep me intrigued. The Story, Mechanics and Flow of the Story Campaign is just excellent. Herein also lies the issue, very little marketing was aimed at  the Storymode, to the degree that I almost feel like alot of players might not even have given it a try before reviewing.\n\ntldr; DM mode is not great yet, but it is still under development. Story mode is excellent and a worthy descendant of Baldur´s Gate. Overall this game is a solid buy, that promises many hours of spellbound joy.","October 26, 2015","true","6.7"," 18 of 35 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","18","35","0","0"

I believe that it is the closest that a computer game has come to replicating a real tabletop d&d experience. There are other tabletop simulators, but they all fail to have matchmaking, which this game has! So let's dive in to why I like this so much amidst a sea of haters.\n\nI'd like to start by mentioning that I am a big D&D fan, used to play 2nd edition through 5th. I will also be honest and say that this game does not capture the true tabletop experience, but what computer game really could?\nPros: 1) DM Mode\n2) Matchmaking for DMs and Players\n3) Publish and Play your own campaign and the campaigns of others\n4) Decent character cusomization\n5) Even better NPC customization\n6) Decent Quest Creation System, generally works correctly\n7) A great fanbase of old school and new fans alike\n8) Pause/Play options give the option for more strategic, old school D&D feel\n9) Good Story Mode (also unlocks new DM items)\n10) Lots of content on release and more on its way regularly\n11) Built in push-to-talk communication and typing chat\n12) Devs that truly care\n\nCons: 1) Need some more character customization options\n2) Need more character/npc voice options\n3) Would love to have the ability to make quest options/ branching quest lines (a tall order, I know)\n4) Need open sea tiles! I know they will add them eventually, can't wait. Need ships, ocean, docks, etc.\n5) Occasional bugs/glitches, many of which have been fixed already\n6) When play testing a campaign module, changes that you make after the play test don't apply to those saves\n7) Long wait times for matchmaking, especially as a DM looking for players\n\nOverall, this is an excellent game and I am very glad to have purchased the collector's edition. I am looking forward to playing d&d with tons of friendly new people. Keep in mind that old school players tend to have a playstyle that they prefer, and new players do to (though they may not have found it yet). One must have patience when finding the right people to play d&d with. I am a philosophy major and prefer a more diplomacy-centric and story driven play-style. Fortunately, I am able to find others with similar interests. So keep that in mind, don't play one game and say "Those guys were immature ♥♥♥♥♥" and quit. You need to find what playstyle suits you best, and find players/DMs that cater well to that style. I will continue updating my reviews as the game progresses, but I am genuinely thoroughly impressed thus far.\np.s. for people that are saying this game is too hard... there are many ways to fix that. First, and most obvious, would be the difficulty settings (there's DM difficulty settings upon creation, and player difficulty settings for playing.). Other than that, there are numerous things that the DM can do to decrease the challenge for his players:\n1) Demote Enemies/ Promote Allies\n2) Create Custom Enemies with low stats (and one can set player level offset to -5)\n3) Create more allied NPCs to fight alongside your players\n4) You can actually damage and heal any npc/enemy on the fly (Caution:This dmg/healing done does NOT save, so must be done within the desired session. e.g. You dmg NPC health while creating a campaign, then it will revert to full; but if you get your players in the session and pause it, u can then lower the health of NPCs/enemies.)\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope to see you on Sword Coast Legends soon!

I logged 20+ hours in the pre-release and while the content is currently underwhelming; they listen to their community and seem dedicated to building on their preexisting base. For D&D players, (like myself) the mechanics and classes implemented in the game are loose adaptations, not strict copies. Yet the lore is mostly spot on and they do a great job bringing the Swords Coast to life.\n\nThe development team behind the game is quite small, with strong ties to the community. My recomendation is to focus on creating a modding community around the game, so we can help add more unique content to the world.

On one hand, it's a lot of D&D hack-fest fun. But on the other, it's missing so many  features that I find necessary to "find the fun."\n\nWhen I went through each of the headstarts, I kept finding problems that would make me quit, hoping it would be fixed by the next headstart. Alas, none were. The developers say they are listening to the fans, but where's the result?\n\nI did not come into this game expecting D&D 5th Edition. I get that every Thursday night with my gaming group. This is a video game, so I'm good with the skill trees and combat system. It's slightly mundane, but decent.\n\nMy problem is in the details. My grievences:\n\n- The UI is terrible. The text is TINY. I want to play this on my bigscreen, but it's impossible. It's also hard to scroll down sometimes, making navigation frustrating.\n- The COOLDOWNS. Oh my god, the cool downs. I litterally have to wait 2-3 minutes between fights to get my skills back. It's ridiculous and slows the game WAY down.\n- Yet another game when I have to individually click every damn object TWICE to loot. Developers, go play Pillars of Eternity and see how looting is done right.\n- The journal and quest marker are horendous. The journal will give me no indication where I'm supposed to go and the quest marker will only appear when you're right next to it. Sometimes I feel like I'm wandering around aimlessly, hoping to get lucky.\n- I can't make my own party for module play. Why the heck not? This is supposed to be MY game, let me play the way I want to.\n- When creating modules, I can't even place an NPC and have him say something. Unless it's purely Quest related, I can't have any conversation. So much for creating "STORY."\n- Speaking of DM Tools, they are much more constraining then enjoyable. New areas can only be opened on a new quest and completing a quest. Collection quests automatically end when all items are collected (so not turn in, no way to advance that part of the story). This is the tip of the iceburg.\n\nOverall, I just can't recommend this game. Not the way it is. There better be a serious version 2.0 somewhere down the line or I just wasted my money.","October 20, 2015","false","47.1"," 20 of 39 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","20","39","0","0"

Personally I like, I like it lots, and Im playing it.\n\nThats the short review.\n\nHere is the longer review:\n\nMany previous reviews are posted by DnD nerds (like myself) who I believe have unrealistic expectations about the how this product should be. I don't think these expectations marry up with the realities in the gaming market. In short some folk are a bit precious. Any old school gamer expecting an isometric DnD based rpg to have the same impact as early DnD products is never going to be satisfied.\n\nA lot of reviews compare this game to Pillars of Eternity and Divinity Original Sin. I haven't played the latter but the former didn't move me that much. I prefer this game. Not really sure why. I abandoned the PoE campaign, got bored, maybe Ill go back to it one day.\n\nA few re-occurring complaints that I would like to address:\n\nSkill Trees:\n+ Are good - they allow people not familiar with 5e to make informed early decisions about the possible roles for different classes and make early decisions about how make characters as effective as possible.\n+ Provide the carrot for the next level.\n+ DnD 5e uses skill trees for all classes. They just arent obvious and they are much more restrictive. Dont believe me? What is an archetype then?\n\nAbility Cool Down vs Short Rest/Long Rest\n+ For those not in the know... DnD 5e uses a mechanic to regain abilities by taking a short or long rest. Cool downs emulate this by having different cool down rates. 20s to 200s are most common. Cantrips normally have 2s cool downs.\n+ Resting mechanic in a computer game causes the game to be all about the next rest spot. To stop players hitting the rest button after every combat so they dont just spam their best stuff a control needs to be put in place.\n+ The much discussed PoE uses cool downs and they arent fast and limits resting by having allow characters to only carry 4 days of rest supplies. I dont know about anyone else but Ive been tramping/hiking I can carry more then 4 days food AND I dont have 18 strength and a limitless storage box that I can put all the stuff I dont want into (refer again PoE).\n\nIts NOT DnD, its some weird hybrid:\n+ I suspect the market for a pure DnD 5e computer game is small. Only real DnDers will buy. Not all DnDers play computer games.\n+ 5e has a significant learning curve. You will lose players not familiar with the system. This system is quick to pick up.\n+ If PoE branded itself as DnD (which it clearly is a copy of. I wonder if copy write infringement was considered) we would have the same complaints as we are seeing for this product.\n\nMobs have too many hit points. Spells dont do enough damage:\n+ Spells dont do enough damage. I agree.\n+ Mobs have too many hit points. I agree.\n+ Pure 5e is unforgiving for new players. Surround a character with a low AC with hobgoblins and watch them fall over FAST.\n+ High hit points and low damage out put is an industry standard.\n+ Effective and scalable AI is too difficult a problem to be financial viable. It's easier to make mobs TUFF.\n+ Game difficulty is often controlled by durability of mobs.\n+ Almost all isometric rpg games use this mechanism. PoE certainly does. It frustated me, it still frustrates me.\n\nLimited release of classes/races is a ploy to make money\n+ Wizards of the Coast are here to make money.\n+ You make money by selling stuff.\n+ Computer games are expensive to make (dont believe me? Have you looked at the credits? Are you a professional? How much do you get paid?)\n\nReview ends.\n","October 26, 2015","true","49.2"," 20 of 39 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","20","39","0","0"

(Create your own adventure modules)\nThe editor started out as a way for groups of people to engage in a 4 & 1 campaign, with a live Dungeon Master, able to possess monsters, NPCs and throw enemies, and treasure at the party in equal measure.\n\nThe editor is great for a live DM, with some caveats, you cannot assign specific loot or XP to the party as a DM and monsters will scale to the average level of your group. If that doesn't tickle you, you might be disappointed.\n\nThe editor also allows for creators to make their own modules for the community to play, without a live DM, and its here you will find the games main weak point.\nThere's not a huge amount of available tilesets to choose from, and at the moment, the quest dialogue implementation leaves something to be desired, however these are things that the developers are aware of, and have said they will actively work on improving post-launch.\n\nAll in all, is Sword Coast Legends perfect? No, but especially the DM tool is a work in progress and will only get better as time goes by.\n\nA common misconception is people expecting SCL to deliver the level of customizable module making that NWN did,\nwhich it doesn't. It's simpler, much easier to use, but as a consequence, at the moment, its also more limited in scope.\n\nDon't expect the game to be something its not.\nWith all that said, the 40 hour story mode is easily worth the price of admission.\n\n8/10 for me","October 20, 2015","true","68.3"," 20 of 39 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","20","39","0","0"

We have found this game to be a blast! It isn't like Baulder's Gate/Neverwinter Nights/Icewindale/Temple of Elemental Evil/ or what have you, but those games aren't much like each other, either, which is why I judge them seperately. It doesn't follow the rules to the letter, but even in the rule books, they state that their rules are only guidelines, and that they are meant to be broken, bent, and forgotten.\n\nPros-\n-The gameplay is great fun! It feels much different in a single and multiplayer setting. I use the single player for a more tactical apporach, knowing exactly what each character is going to do. Multiplayer feels more like the real thing, though, with players doing their own thing with battle, NPC's, and such.\n\n-Music has that nice "adventure" feel to it.\n\n-Classes can be made to be vaired. I play a caster cleric, casting from the backlines to buff, heal, and smite from afar. I have seen a bow based cleric, classic mace and shield, and a greatsword toating frontline crusher. I'm glad this doesn't limit you on what you can do within that class.\n\n-Enviroment is very nice to look at.\n\n-NPC interaction can be very enjoying! I got a guy drunk enough to steal his peg leg because I was told it was an ancient artifact weapon.\n\n-It has that feeling of going on an adventure through the dungeons of DnD with my party, but I can actually see what is happening.\n\n\nCons-\n-No multiclassing or archetypes (at least yet, as the NPC's have archetype type trees). These classes could become even more unique if we were to have these things. More classes would be an added bonus!\n\n-Character models are meh.\n\n-No respec. Even when I DM, I allow my players to go through retraining to change out feats or levels (for a small sum of course).\n\n\n\nThis is a great game for your PnP group to get together and play for a change in pace.

I know some people are disappointed, but it has really good potential. For now I have mostly stuck to single player since a drawback of multiplayer is a mixed bag.  It works if you have a group of friends playing with same mindset  RP vs Hack and slash.  It does not work so well if people randomly put on together without some sort of filter indicating playstyle on the join queue.\n\none of the things I found lacking is storage or the lack of a stronghold.  There are several instances where a cleared location or house may become a base, but its a lost opportunity on the developer's side. Additionally storage is a major issue. I seem to be a packrat and it defaults on the leader's strength abilities rather than the party members individually (first playthru is a wizard).  Overall the NPCS work well enough and there are quite a few of my favorites.\n\nAt its current stage, the game seems more like a diamond in the rough, but as it further develops with the community and game designers, it will really come to shine.","October 24, 2015","true","54.9"," 22 of 43 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","22","43","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emprenos/recommended/325600/","emprenos","Scavenger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emprenos/","125 products in account","First of all, I've spent about 92 hours on the Head Start Access before the game was released. And I've been playing since Head Start 2 (which was the first time it was released to all pre-orders) and obviously spent a lot of time with the game. Here is my take on the game.\n\nI've spent the most time on the DM creator tool and have already released 2 modules. I have only spent a very minimum amount of time on the story campaign, but what little time I spent on it, was a rather nice experience. Granted, I only completed the start portion of the campaign, so I cannot say how well will it be later on but from most player's thoughts on it, the Story Campaign is a good one.\n\nI'll be focusing more on the module creator and the multiplayer aspect of the game.\n\nFirst thing's first, as many people have said and will say, the DM creator is incredibly limited. There are no branching dialogues, no item-based interactions (using a key to open a door), no option to edit your dungeons (adding or removing rooms), no manual triggers for certain events (changing a character's hostility after dialogues) and possibly some others. It's true that the DM is very limiting.\n\nBUT!\n\nAs limiting as it is, it isn't that bad of an editor to work with. Sure you'll be limited  to bare simple interactions and some simple things may take several turns to do, but it's not impossible to create a narrative-driven module with the current system. It might take a lot more dialogues to get it done, but it's far from impossible. I've played several modules that are very well done and well designed. It's all dependent on how the creator play around with the limitations.\n\nWhile talking about the limitations, I'll be talking about the DM mode for playing with other players. I've tried DM-ing a few runs with some friends and I can honestly say, some of the limitations of the module creator can be bypassed with the presence of a DM. Having a DM allows a lot of manual changes to be done to the module, from adding or removing monsters, providing extra challenge, changing the hostility of a character at will, adding quests on the fly and changing existing things on the fly. Just like the traditional PnP D&D experience, having a good DM solidifies the experience even more. And the DM mode of Sword Coast Legends was heavily marketed and I personally feel that they've done a pretty decent job doing it. It's fun having an active DM that plays around with group.\n\nThat being said, the multiplayer aspect of the game is bad to good, depending on who you play with. For one, Sword Coast Legends has a very bad loot system, where everything is shared. So some players may just run in and grab everything, leaving nothing for you, which is obviously bad. I do not know if they can fix this in the future, but I sure hope they do.\n\nIn the early Head Start days, the game was plagued by bad connections. It was almost impossible to play a multiplayer session nicely without some people disconnecting along the way. But over time, they seem to have fixed most of the connection issues, though certain bugs still persists from time to time. Things that can be ironed out with time, and the devs have said they will continue to support the game for quite some time. So give it time.\n\nAgain, I haven't really started playing the story campaign, but I'm looking forward to it.\n\nAs of now, I would give this game a score of 7/10. But if they add more contents and crush more of the bugs, this could get a good 8 from me. And if they eventually release a more powerful module creator, this may very well be a good 9/10. Because the DM portion of the game, is very good.\n\nIf you love classic RPG, this could be a good game for you at its price point. It's also a pretty good D&D themed game, and can only be expanded even more in the future.","October 23, 2015","true","55.3"," 28 of 55 people (51%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","51","28","55","4","0"

As an example when I'm hosting a game playing through the main story, and one of my party interacts with an NPC that has something significant to do with the main story line, it automatically gives me, the host, control of the conversation...\n\nAs a party leader thats kind of ok, but not really because it makes the rest of the party characters redundant in that conversation. It's also annoying to be on the complete opposite side of luskan and be not only interrupted with the fade out and interaction of the conversation but also in some cases automagically teleported there...\n\nRegarding the conversation control. the big issue is that when I am hosting, My friends supremely likable Paladin whose charisma modifier is somewhere between George Clooney and Santa, is not able to roll Charisma checks to see if Mr NPC that had a job for us to do is going to give us his eldest daughters virginity as an additional bonus for clearing out his basement full of rats... Instead it uses my Wizards dark aura of loathing, which means I'd probably have a better chance of being likable and getting a successful charisma roll, if I cast Fireball II at an orphanage full of adorable puppies. (thus not playing to the party strengths :P)\n\nIt's all well and good to have to deploy some tactical firing of skills in combat to keep the party alive but we should be able to play the rest of the game tactically too, not "Party leader is the enforced designated spokesperson till the end of time".\n\n/end rant... Hoping for great things, definitely playable as it is regardless of some frustrations. looking forward to more content, some fixes,and hopefully not pricey DLC.","October 23, 2015","true","32.6"," 30 of 59 people (51%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","51","30","59","6","0"

I'm pleasantly surprised after having played the main story all weekend during the last headstart.\n\nDisregarding some D&D 5th ed. rules liberties taken (This is a computer game, after all), I must say this game really captures that computer game D&D feel well. The atmosphere, the music (Inon Zur), the party bantering, the tone of the story, the narrative and the characters (generous sprinkling of humour, with some story arc golden oldies with a new twist or two), are pretty much spot on and very fun to experience. Sure, most quests are so-called fetch quests, but believe me, I have played all D&D computer games since the early 80's, and the great majority of quests have been that way. For the most part, despite some linearity, the entertainment value and general feel to the game easily outweigh any such basic qualms.\n\nIs this the Forgotten Realms I love? It sure is!\n\nIs this Dungeons & Dragons that I adore? Absolutely!\n\nDo I get to build a character I can cherish and enjoy with a number of fun and interesting companions? Yup!\n\nAlso, so far, the bugs have been few and far between, and anything but game breaking.\n\nAll in all, this is a huge dollop of D&D CRPG of fun, and a worthy successor of BG and NWN1/2 as far as their single-player OCs go!\n\nThe worst negatives, so far, is the monster scaling and the loot abundance, and if you love wizards, you get no spell books, but skill trees like everybody else.\n\nIf the toolset, at least later on, allows us to deliver the same kind of fun, this game will hopefully be around for years to come and let the D&D CRPG creative juices flow copiously.","October 20, 2015","true","1.6"," 37 of 73 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","37","73","0","0"

The story is excellent. Very immerssive and it hearkens back to the days of Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale, and Neverwinter Nights I and II. But now, it is even better, because now you can experience it with your friends in co-op!\n\nHighlights (no spoilers). I really like the character creation and the user-interface. Very easy to use and makes for good D&D adventuring. I enjoy the isomorphic view, as it is classic D&D PC gaming at its best. Good for party interaction and quickly switching between characters if playing solo.\n\nStrengths: In addition to the above, I like the quick-play feature of making a dungeon and setting off on a quick dungeon crawl with friends or with strangers from the lobby. The time I did this it was fun and a good time was had by all. Didn't have to wait too long either for the group of four to set out on the adventure.\n\nObviously, the aforementioned. :)\n\nWeaknesses: None that I really can see at this point! That's a good thing!\n\nSummary: I hope that WotC and the Developers continue to pour out more stories and campaigns, not to mention what the community can put out! Ok, here's a wish of mine I'd love to see fulfilled...a full-scale Waterdeep, mapped out to the n-th degree from the boxed D&D Forgotten Realms pen and paper reference materials!

Best games so far was the Baldur's Gates and Neverwinter Nights's. So I was expecting pretty much of this game when I heard it's going to be released. First impression of the game was that it's not good, starting from the stupid game mechanics and lack of classes. The skills are now in skilltrees like in every other new RPG and theres not even all the basic D&D classes available like the bard or the druid. Even multiclassing is not possible. Well i was going to look past this and try the single player campaign which might be OK if you try to forget that this was supposed to be D&D. Then I looked to the editor and was hoping much that maybe this saves the game. I was hoping too much, the editor lacks many of the basic features that you would expect from an editor. I am so disappointed that I am a bit angry now, since Neverwinter Nights the whole D&D brand has lost so much of it's former glory and now they are releasing stuff like this under it's name. Maybe they will manage to make this into a decent product, but I think it might take year or two if ever.","October 20, 2015","false","3.5"," 18 of 36 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","18","36","0","0"

Turns take about 1 second or less and every character except maybe a shield bearing one in full plate armor is way too squishy and will get eviscerated in 1 second or less. To compensate this, they give you the ability to click-to-res where any character can res another just by clicking on it in 1 second or less so your best combat tactic are RES TRAINS !!!\nAlso there's no rest and no spell memorization system. Since spells and talents are not D&D based, eventual product of combat including rolls and other stuff (running away in combat actaully works!) has nothing to do with D&D either therefore causing attributes to lose meaning, not that you had much say on those creating a character (can't put less than 8 in any attribute).\n\n- Questing are like of a generic MMO, grocery list style. Except attribute-check dialog options, you literally have no other options except talking with the NPC that has a ! sign on its head and even then, dialogue options are limited and generally doesn't back your alignment specific actions.\n\n- Co-op multiplayer is a mess: When played with 2 people, host controls 3 characters and guest controls 1 which is a total failure since one guy has to control 3x the amount of characters in a realtime game which causes one guy in a position to do a lot of stuff in a short duration while the other waits. You can't change control of companions. Also host decides every dialogue option related to main story while the guest is only watching. Guest can only interact with side-quests or vendors. Also pause system with short rounds is a total mess.\n\n- Friendly AI is a mess with no way to set it up how you want it to play: Characters in your party will keep on casting random stuff if you don't micro-manage their every action and you have no control over it,\n\n- DM Mode dungeon crawl is an original idea but seeing where the DM is really kills all the immersion.\n\nTLDR; Do not buy, go purchase Divinity: Original Sin instead if you wanna have co-op campaign fun or play an actual mmo if you wanna do Dungeon Crawl.","October 22, 2015","false","0.3"," 19 of 38 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","19","38","3","0"

I was able to try this game (briefly) during a free weekend. The game was on sale 50% off, and I had considered buying recently when it was on sale 40%. I pretty much like every DND based game, so even though the reviews where not great, I was going to give it a chance. Luckily, I got busy and missed the sale, and then right after they had it on sale for 50% off with a free weekend to try it out!! Awesome, the game can't be that bad if they are letting you try it first!!\n\nI must admit to some bias here. I do not like the new dnd rules with trees much like WoW. I liked second edition more, and even D&D Onlines change over to 3rd edition+ was annoying for me. That being said, it was not the character development and ruleset etc that turned me off as much as the tons of glitches, problems with the map, and game bugs. I had 2 game breaking bugs within minutes of startup, and barely got past the very start because the map decided to jump far away in the first area, and wouldn't let me click anywhere to get my character to leave etc.\n\nI did.....finally...figure a way out (actually still not even sure what I did...but somehow it moved me to the next area) and was able to play. I'm also not a fan of controling groups of characters, although some games like dungeon siege II have done it very well. I did not feel like this game did it well, or that you had any real feeling of playing a dnd character (again it felt much like playing a bunch of difference classes from WoW at once, from a different perspective. I might mention I am not a fan of WoW or the clones and hate that it has spread into other genres at this point.\n\nI will say that I only played for an hour or two at most, and just gave up. I didn't like the game at all, and was VERY happy I did not purchase it. Maybe it will improve in the future, but I strongly suggest not purchasing it unless you can try it first. If they have a demo, and they drastically improve the game, then maybe it will be worth picking up sometime. For now, even for die hard dnd fans (seriously I've played just about every DnD game and enjoyed almost all of them at least to some extent), I would pass on this game. There are better free to play dnd games out there (WAY BETTER). It's sad, but honestly I would rather go back and play my NWN games (or never winter online), then this game.","December 19, 2015","false","1.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

In the recent Headstart 5, they claimed they were "Holding" a lot of the DM maker back.....I honestly want to be sick.   I load in expecting a lot of new monsters...Orcs, Dragons...Giants!  Sadly, nothing.   there are 2 Devil models they show cased as a teaser for HS5...leaving it hintingly that there will be more....And..Low and behold, N-Space makes good on their reputation....Nothing.  There is only a few maps that they held back as "Spoilers"  There is still no way to link zones.  there is an entrance...and an exit.  that is it...linear play at its best...MARIO WORLD HAD MORE WAYS TO TRAVEL!    No new traps, puzzles to build, pressure plates....nothing at all.  Even the few maps that were held back are not even randomizable...you will do the same city scene...over and over and over and over....I honestly was expecting a lot more from this product....No branching dialogue....No Necromancy "Skill tree" for players.   they need to change the wording of their Necromance with the heart of gold to "Big Fail incoming guys!"   The lies....the lies....it is staggering.   The only reason they held back the DM mode for HS5 was becasue they knew...they KNEW!   there is nothing of spoiler or substance....maybe ellysium?  Which looks straight out of a rip off of Diablo III????\n\nNothing like BG or Neverwinter.....Nothing like D&D for that matter.    There are talent trees instead of spell books.   there is scaling enemies that will always be just as strong as you are...meaning you gain a level, that rat gains a level.  The HP for a goblin was 250 or something at like level 1 or something.   The game only tested my patience, not my skill.   you can resurect a fallen ally at any time by any character.  there is no need for a raise dead spell....So I don't even know why they put it in there...There are no need for temples, no need for taverns since there are no spells in a spell book to memorize...Instead you talent into Magic Missle 1...then into Magic Missle 2...and so on.\n\nThere's no feeling of progression.  There is no custom Items for you to reward your players with....pretty much killing their reason to even go on adventures.  The maps are all pre fabricated....And worst butcher of all was the idea to cross platform this game with Console.  So now, all the old BG and Neverwinter fans that were looking for what SCL promised will get a gauntlet style play mixed with Diablo and Warcraft style mechanics.\n\nThe DM mode which should have been awesome has been restricted to meaningless nothing.   No one will really want to play online with random people anyway, and this is what is forced down our throats....Let people find and play with people they enjoy playing with.  Don't make all these rules for pug and pick up play and force it on everyone.  Almost no one will really want to DM for strangers.  Let them have full control of the DM tools...But this is meant for cross platform.  It feels like Mario maker meets medieval Contra.\nThere are no penalties for dying.  Just respawn at the back of the cave and zerg the place again and again....same with traps....why bother looking for them.  With your heals on Cool down and no real risk at all...just run them over and kill the same end boss over and over even if you are level 1....thats right.  scaling means you fight dragons at level 1 and win....yay...Immersion.    BG had a PC version (AWESOME)  and a Console version (Also awesome)   Why were they both awesome?  BECASUSE THEY WERE DESIGNED TO UTILIZE THE BEST OF THE PLATFORM THEY ARE ON!    Not to toss the best away and mix in a bunch of garbage to fit the other.\n\nAgain, butchering what could have been an indepth meaningful Dungeons and Dragons experience so they can attempt to force more random people to play together by cross platforming (Because clearly you can't make friends on your own)  you now get to interact with all those kids looking to impart their 16 years of wisdom of working the 7-11 or living in their mothers basement....Wisdom such as "YOU MAD BRO?"  or "You are totally a NOOB....My Cleric was LEET before ur mamma got PHAT!" Oh the joy...\n\nI know I'll be doing a lot of QQing for all the lost potential this game had...Perhaps in the future they will make a D&D game...I don't know...D&D.  And leave the cross platform dumbed down Guantlet boring old hack n Slash at the door.\n\nThe story is pretty solid at least so far....Maybe a 1 weekend wonder then to the shelf as a place holder for real future D&D games.....If you enjoy being lied to, if you enjoy getting left over scraps to play with from the Devs....If you really enjoyed the days of gauntlet and would love to relive that...over and over in SCL...then yes..This is the game for you.","October 20, 2015","false","23.8"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

Very unbalanced.\n\nIf they removed attribute points from items all together it may help correct this issue. Other stats seem relatively balanced but the attribute stacking makes rogues and dex fighters extremely over powered and clerics / wizards relatively useless.\n\nSurely someone noticed this. Stacking the attributes such as Dex increases the to hit, damage, and AC for the character and the poor str fighter back here has a low AC because he's in plate and not light.\n\nHope I made some sense.","October 29, 2015","false","26.0"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

The only thng that seems to run well is the group play but so far I haven't found a good group to play with.  Combat is frustrating as can be.  It's a weird mix of having to pause the game to give orders and then your hero running too fast doing that action then jumping into AI controlled mode very poorly so you are constantly having to micro manage everything they do.

When I started it the game would not allow me to set a password to gain access. Why would this game need a password? Then I started without the Steam overlay and was directed to their website to register. Then I could set a password (why did they need my email address?). Then went back to Steam and the game "ran." Frankly, in a span of about fifteen minutes I was shocked. Ancient interface, horrible resolution. Bad blurry graphics. I pumped up to max resolution on my iMac, and it was still bad. Combat is point and sit back. I have never been a D&D fanatic so the stream of negatives moaning about poor D&D implementation did not faze me. I thought this would be a nice improvement to Baldurs Gate and its iterations. WRONG. Maybe my brief dip in the SCL pool was insufficient for a fair review. Maybe there is a gem buried beneath the manure.

The story is excellent. Very immerssive and it hearkens back to the days of Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale, and Neverwinter Nights I and II. But now, it is even better, because now you can experience it with your friends in co-op!\n\nHighlights (no spoilers). I really like the character creation and the user-interface. Very easy to use and makes for good D&D adventuring. I enjoy the isomorphic view, as it is classic D&D PC gaming at its best. Good for party interaction and quickly switching between characters if playing solo.\n\nStrengths: In addition to the above, I like the quick-play feature of making a dungeon and setting off on a quick dungeon crawl with friends or with strangers from the lobby. The time I did this it was fun and a good time was had by all. Didn't have to wait too long either for the group of four to set out on the adventure.\n\nObviously, the aforementioned. :)\n\nWeaknesses: None that I really can see at this point! That's a good thing!\n\nSummary: I hope that WotC and the Developers continue to pour out more stories and campaigns, not to mention what the community can put out! Ok, here's a wish of mine I'd love to see fulfilled...a full-scale Waterdeep, mapped out to the n-th degree from the boxed D&D Forgotten Realms pen and paper reference materials!

It takes it's own, different twist on the RPG style from previous D&D games and I like that about it. The combat is fast, punchy, satisfying and looks great. The loot is varied and worth searching for. The environments are beautifully crafted and look awesome. The quests aren't anything to write home about, basically your standard RPG affair, but at least they're engaging so you don't lose interest. Overall I think it's a great game, and if you're going into it hoping for Bauldur's gate, you're going to be dissappointed, but if you look at it as  completely seperate game with new and different features (which it is! is it called Baulder's gate 3? NO!) you're definitely going to get a lot of enjoyment out of it.\n\nThis isn't a perfect game though. My main complaint is that it seems to have trouble running on my computer, which isn't really the game's fault, but If I can run Alien Isolation on almost max settings, I don't know why this game's frame rate dropps to 2 fps if the graphics are anything higher than the lowest possible settings. The other minor complaint I have is that your chracter says some dumb remark LITERALLY every single time you click to move. It's sooo anoying. If you're like me, you don't click terribly far away when you're waliking, because you want to see everything and search for loot, so every two seconds my paladin's saying "As you wish" or "I can do that". It gets really old really fast.\n\nThose problems aside, I still love this game. It's a great RPG and I can't wait to sink even more hours of my free time into it.","November 7, 2015","true","10.8"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

Only a single very annoying drawback: Every time you talk to an NPC, be it a merchant or a quest type NPC, the game pauses for everyone in the party and you are (almost all the time) teleported directly to the speaker.

Asides from the dull graphics and the vetigo-inducing, unchanging perspective, which makes tactical combat and working out the occasional puzzles more difficult than needed, the gameplay is just boring. It plays like a sub-standard Diablo, yet lacked excitement. The gameplay of the solo game was so disappointing, it put me off trying the multiplayer version.\nIn the solo campaign, the game's writers seemed to use the Fantasy section of tvtropes.com as a guideline: heavy drinking dwarf CHECK, nicer-than-nice elf CHECK, good priests being evil CHECK (also a plot device from the original Neverwinter Nights).\nFor those who are expecting a new Dungeons and Dragons game will be disappointed. The gameplay is standard MMORPG, similar to Dungeons and Dragons Online, and the only connection to D&D's Forgotten Realms world is cosmetic.\nEssentially, if you want a great fantasy MMORPG, there are many others to play. If you want a great D&D solo RPG, there's Neverwinter Nights and the enhanced Baldur's Gates.

I grew up with AD&D, and I'm a big RPG fan. I mostly play RPGs on consoles now, but complicated ones like Baulders Gate I loved on the PC.\n\nI was willing to forgive some of the art because the overall look of the game is pretty poor. I kept telling myself, it's going to be ok if the gameplay was solid.\n\nI gave Sword Coast a try, and I found I could not get into it. For starters, Character creation itself needs a bunch of work. Having to sign up was already really awkward. There should always be a text box up at one of the sides to explain everything rather than having to mousing over to read a popup every time. Things were already looking rough, and I used to find huge enjoyment in D&D character creation.\n\nI found gameplay chaotic for a D&D style game. Playing the generated simple dungeon with just my character taught me so much more than the little bit of story I played.

However, in practice, things are a bit more lackluster. While I'm getting a definite NWN vibe, the controls for movement feel laggy and clunky. There's a decent bit of delay between clicking, the target circle showing up, and the characters actually moving. It jut doesn't feel as responsive as it could be.\n\nThe camera controls are also a bit annoying. Intuitively, one would think that moving the cursor to the edges of the screen would cause the camera to move when it's not actively following the characters. Nope. WASD. Very frustrating.\n\nThe story seems to be the usual fantasy fare, but it wasn't enough to really grab my attention. In NWN, you're essentially thrown into things. You're training at a guild that's safeguarding magical animals to help try and stop a plague that's ravaging the city of Neverwinter. Immediately, you know there's big stuff going down. SCL? So, I'm in a guild and I'm escorting a caravan and been having nightmares. Ok.\n\nI will say that I liked the enviroments and the character customization. It was realtivly painfree to create my character, and I like that there was enough explaination that I knew what each option would do. Handy since I've never played a DnD tabletop game and only know the bare basics about it.\n\nOverall, the game isn't bad, but it's not great. It's just kind of...Meh. Not really a game I'd recommend buying unless it heavily goes on sale.","December 19, 2015","false","0.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I kept telling myself, it's going to be ok if the gameplay was solid.\n\nI gave Sword Coast a try, and I found I could not get into it. For starters, Character creation itself needs a bunch of work.

Normally this is fine and all because in D&D you start out fighting small threats, which have about as much HP and damage potential as you do.\n\nBut we quickly found out that the starting bandits and the like have up to 50 HP and we did about 3 to 12 damage if we got a lucky hit in.\n\nI would caution people interested in D&D and it's universe and already know some of it. This game is NOTHING like D&D, it is an Action-Dungeon Crawler, not a RPG.\n\nThe reasons for this are as follows:\n\nThe Combat feels floaty and not at all like D&D should feel. You have no feed back on your hits or misses, you don't know how high your roll was, you ust sometimes see damage come up.\n\nThe Leveling System feels odd, and not at all like D&D is supposed to go. You start with a few abilities and as you level you unlock the possibility of more skills, but you only have a limited point system to get your skills, unlike D&D where you get a certain skill each level and/or every few levels.\n\nThe loot system is awkward, there is no rhyme or reason readily available why something that is clearly worth 250 or so gold pieces is only worth about 50 gold pieces when you sell it to a vendor. Why even bother letting us know it's true value?\n\nObviously, the Dungeon Crawl mode has little room for Role Playing, but even outside of it, it is simple dialogue options and no visasble skill checks, like in D&D\n\n\nTL:DR version.\n\nDo not buy unless it is 5 euros or less.\n\nIt is nothing like D&D and is lacking in good interface or combat or RP gameplay.","December 19, 2015","false","4.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

The story has a tendency to be tedious and boring, but isn't the worst I ever saw. The system is rather limited, in that skills, feats, and spells are munched together into the same skill tree, with no class mixing. All skills are cooldown-based, with all classes playing out fairly similarly. Every class can be trained to bear any weapon or wear any armor, or take over the more common portion of a rogue's skillset. Then again searching for traps is not as necessary anymore, what with the abundance of healing spells that kick in the second you take damage from a trap; but there are quite a few secrets on the maps, so having e.g. a cleric in the team with some searching/lockpicking skills is useful.\nSkills almost always come in multiple efficiency levels, which often can be bought with little or no level restriction. My cleric had his primary healing spell maxed out at lvl 2. Maxed out meaning there will not be a more efficient healing spell for him. Not at lvl3 and not at lvl 100, if it goes that far.

It came down to the fact that if you want a D&D game that lets you choose tactics and really get immersed in your unit you should pick up Dragon Age:Origins instead. SCL has a lot going on, plenty of quests, lots of varied enemies, but ultimately the combat was the devisive point. There is no way to create battle formations or queue up your parties abilities so you can layer your attacks and heals, it's all on autopilot except for the unit you are currently commanding, so It just turns into a clickfest. It's a fun clickfest, but it's not as good as it could be. I'd say wait until this game drops below ten bucks and you won't feel ripped off.","December 20, 2015","false","11.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

It had all the things that could be good in a D&D franchise game:   group play,  DM controlled environments, making your own dungeons,  Build your own characters, etc.    Unfortunately it does almost all of these somewhere between average and poorly.  The only thng that seems to run well is the group play but so far I haven't found a good group to play with.  Combat is frustrating as can be.  It's a weird mix of having to pause the game to give orders and then your hero running too fast doing that action then jumping into AI controlled mode very poorly so you are constantly having to micro manage everything they do.  Add to that underwhelming spells, abilities and even most monsters and it is more frustrating then entertaining.\n\nMaybe with a few major updates this could have potential but I feel I've wasted 40$ so far.  I played for about 3 hours and got bored and have never reloaded.

The story is excellent. Very immerssive and it hearkens back to the days of Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale, and Neverwinter Nights I and II. But now, it is even better, because now you can experience it with your friends in co-op!\n\nHighlights (no spoilers). I really like the character creation and the user-interface. Very easy to use and makes for good D&D adventuring. I enjoy the isomorphic view, as it is classic D&D PC gaming at its best. Good for party interaction and quickly switching between characters if playing solo.\n\nStrengths: In addition to the above, I like the quick-play feature of making a dungeon and setting off on a quick dungeon crawl with friends or with strangers from the lobby. The time I did this it was fun and a good time was had by all. Didn't have to wait too long either for the group of four to set out on the adventure.\n\nObviously, the aforementioned. :)\n\nWeaknesses: None that I really can see at this point! That's a good thing!\n\nSummary: I hope that WotC and the Developers continue to pour out more stories and campaigns, not to mention what the community can put out! Ok, here's a wish of mine I'd love to see fulfilled...a full-scale Waterdeep, mapped out to the n-th degree from the boxed D&D Forgotten Realms pen and paper reference materials!

It takes it's own, different twist on the RPG style from previous D&D games and I like that about it. The combat is fast, punchy, satisfying and looks great. The loot is varied and worth searching for. The environments are beautifully crafted and look awesome. The quests aren't anything to write home about, basically your standard RPG affair, but at least they're engaging so you don't lose interest. Overall I think it's a great game, and if you're going into it hoping for Bauldur's gate, you're going to be dissappointed, but if you look at it as  completely seperate game with new and different features (which it is! is it called Baulder's gate 3? NO!) you're definitely going to get a lot of enjoyment out of it.\n\nThis isn't a perfect game though. My main complaint is that it seems to have trouble running on my computer, which isn't really the game's fault, but If I can run Alien Isolation on almost max settings, I don't know why this game's frame rate dropps to 2 fps if the graphics are anything higher than the lowest possible settings. The other minor complaint I have is that your chracter says some dumb remark LITERALLY every single time you click to move. It's sooo anoying. If you're like me, you don't click terribly far away when you're waliking, because you want to see everything and search for loot, so every two seconds my paladin's saying "As you wish" or "I can do that". It gets really old really fast.\n\nThose problems aside, I still love this game. It's a great RPG and I can't wait to sink even more hours of my free time into it.","November 7, 2015","true","10.8"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

Prophetic, apocalyptic dreams. Is that the best they can come up with?\n-Character races and classes are severely limited. No half-orcs. No bards. No half-orc bards. No dual/multi classing.\n-Crowd control is severely overpowered. I could stun some bosses.\n-Companions don't have enough banter and situation specific banter. One character is a racist (Understandably explained) and I made a new character of that specific race and received no reaction.\n-Weapons types have no distinction. The only real question is if it's a one hand or two hand weapon and if it's a finesse or regular weapon.\n-Character building system is simplistic. You see a skill, you take a skill. Not much room for creative building or unique synergy.\n\nThe game is a simplistic and plain. Lacking nuance and spice to make it really really nice. If it relies on it's dungeon master mechanic to make really nice campaigns, I would consider such a thing a sloppy choice by the creators. I cannot recommend this at $40.

And no entries at all for many things.\n- Lack of fluff in the world. I just found one thing while exploring, a boars head which had a funny text when clicked.\n- Lack of customisation of characters and classes.\n- Oversimplified combatsystem where everything has a cooldowntimer, ending up not feeling right.\n- It's not a perticularly good looking game, ingame models are thick and basic without much in ways of detail.\n- Some sloppy mapping.

I mostly enjoyed the section of the game I suffered though. My problems lie elsewhere:\n\nSubstantial technical problems.\n\nI have a rig far above the recommended specs, but I'm still running into major issues with frame rate, and even more annoying issues with absurd loading times (90 seconds to 2 minutes to load a save from in game? 2-3 mins from main menu? Da hell???).  Not sure why Mass Effect 3 and Witcher 3 run smooth as silk (and load too quick to read load screens) and this completely average looking game drops down to 15-20 fps in any outdoor environment, regardless of what I set the video options to. (And yes, I also tried playing with/disabling audio sections, eliminating sound as a possible memory drain)\n\nThis is frustrating, as the game overall seemed like a pretty decent romp through the sword coast. Sure, as an old-school D&D nerd it was a shock and a slight disappointment at how simplified the gameplay and tactical aspects were. However, I had read reviews of the game beforehand, and knew to expect massive changes. As some have said/implied, a general "dumbing down" of some rather important D&D mechanics. And the difficulty is a JOKE, the highest difficulty is easier than Pillars of Eternity on Easy. I'm not being exaggerative, either.\n\nStill, I would have rated the game a good 7.5 or 8/10 if it ran properly. I just feel a little insulted by how shoddy this game runs. Hopefully they patch it and rectify this travesty. Somehow, judging by their rather awkward silence over on the SCL offical forums I doubt this is gonna be soon.

In the recent Headstart 5, they claimed they were "Holding" a lot of the DM maker back.....I honestly want to be sick.   I load in expecting a lot of new monsters...Orcs, Dragons...Giants!  Sadly, nothing.   there are 2 Devil models they show cased as a teaser for HS5...leaving it hintingly that there will be more....And..Low and behold, N-Space makes good on their reputation....Nothing.  There is only a few maps that they held back as "Spoilers"  There is still no way to link zones.  there is an entrance...and an exit.  that is it...linear play at its best...MARIO WORLD HAD MORE WAYS TO TRAVEL!    No new traps, puzzles to build, pressure plates....nothing at all.  Even the few maps that were held back are not even randomizable...you will do the same city scene...over and over and over and over....I honestly was expecting a lot more from this product....No branching dialogue....No Necromancy "Skill tree" for players.   they need to change the wording of their Necromance with the heart of gold to "Big Fail incoming guys!"   The lies....the lies....it is staggering.   The only reason they held back the DM mode for HS5 was becasue they knew...they KNEW!   there is nothing of spoiler or substance....maybe ellysium?  Which looks straight out of a rip off of Diablo III????\n\nNothing like BG or Neverwinter.....Nothing like D&D for that matter.    There are talent trees instead of spell books.   there is scaling enemies that will always be just as strong as you are...meaning you gain a level, that rat gains a level.  The HP for a goblin was 250 or something at like level 1 or something.   The game only tested my patience, not my skill.   you can resurect a fallen ally at any time by any character.  there is no need for a raise dead spell....So I don't even know why they put it in there...There are no need for temples, no need for taverns since there are no spells in a spell book to memorize...Instead you talent into Magic Missle 1...then into Magic Missle 2...and so on.\n\nThere's no feeling of progression.  There is no custom Items for you to reward your players with....pretty much killing their reason to even go on adventures.  The maps are all pre fabricated....And worst butcher of all was the idea to cross platform this game with Console.  So now, all the old BG and Neverwinter fans that were looking for what SCL promised will get a gauntlet style play mixed with Diablo and Warcraft style mechanics.\n\nThe DM mode which should have been awesome has been restricted to meaningless nothing.   No one will really want to play online with random people anyway, and this is what is forced down our throats....Let people find and play with people they enjoy playing with.  Don't make all these rules for pug and pick up play and force it on everyone.  Almost no one will really want to DM for strangers.  Let them have full control of the DM tools...But this is meant for cross platform.  It feels like Mario maker meets medieval Contra.\nThere are no penalties for dying.  Just respawn at the back of the cave and zerg the place again and again....same with traps....why bother looking for them.  With your heals on Cool down and no real risk at all...just run them over and kill the same end boss over and over even if you are level 1....thats right.  scaling means you fight dragons at level 1 and win....yay...Immersion.    BG had a PC version (AWESOME)  and a Console version (Also awesome)   Why were they both awesome?  BECASUSE THEY WERE DESIGNED TO UTILIZE THE BEST OF THE PLATFORM THEY ARE ON!    Not to toss the best away and mix in a bunch of garbage to fit the other.\n\nAgain, butchering what could have been an indepth meaningful Dungeons and Dragons experience so they can attempt to force more random people to play together by cross platforming (Because clearly you can't make friends on your own)  you now get to interact with all those kids looking to impart their 16 years of wisdom of working the 7-11 or living in their mothers basement....Wisdom such as "YOU MAD BRO?"  or "You are totally a NOOB....My Cleric was LEET before ur mamma got PHAT!" Oh the joy...\n\nI know I'll be doing a lot of QQing for all the lost potential this game had...Perhaps in the future they will make a D&D game...I don't know...D&D.  And leave the cross platform dumbed down Guantlet boring old hack n Slash at the door.\n\nThe story is pretty solid at least so far....Maybe a 1 weekend wonder then to the shelf as a place holder for real future D&D games.....If you enjoy being lied to, if you enjoy getting left over scraps to play with from the Devs....If you really enjoyed the days of gauntlet and would love to relive that...over and over in SCL...then yes..This is the game for you.","October 20, 2015","false","23.8"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

I didn't want to.  I had so much hope.

It's the stat stacking.  When a lvl 20 rogue has 50 dex and wears light armor everyone else can stay at the entrance of the dungeon and cook dinner while the rogue takes everything out. Very unbalanced.\n\nIf they removed attribute points from items all together it may help correct this issue. Other stats seem relatively balanced but the attribute stacking makes rogues and dex fighters extremely over powered and clerics / wizards relatively useless.\n\nSurely someone noticed this. Stacking the attributes such as Dex increases the to hit, damage, and AC for the character and the poor str fighter back here has a low AC because he's in plate and not light.\n\nHope I made some sense.","October 29, 2015","false","26.0"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

It had all the things that could be good in a D&D franchise game:   group play,  DM controlled environments, making your own dungeons,  Build your own characters, etc.    Unfortunately it does almost all of these somewhere between average and poorly.  The only thng that seems to run well is the group play but so far I haven't found a good group to play with.  Combat is frustrating as can be.  It's a weird mix of having to pause the game to give orders and then your hero running too fast doing that action then jumping into AI controlled mode very poorly so you are constantly having to micro manage everything they do.  Add to that underwhelming spells, abilities and even most monsters and it is more frustrating then entertaining.\n\nMaybe with a few major updates this could have potential but I feel I've wasted 40$ so far.  I played for about 3 hours and got bored and have never reloaded.   I hope they add some major upgrades to make this thing into something people would want to play.","November 11, 2015","false","2.3"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

It should be noted that I only played the singleplayer campaign for some hours however.  All things considered, it was a decently interesting storyline, I actually want to finish the game, but I wouldn't pay anywhere near the price they ask. Which is a shame really. I do like the setting and was hoping for something more similar to previous games set in it.\n\n\nSome negative aspects of the game as I found it:\n\n- Wonky and tedious camera controls which i simply could not get used to which ruined some level of immersion for me.\n- Unclear quest objectives which needed googling (sometimes you can clear an area, get a quest and need to backtrack to a place you already cleared where now a new mob has spawned, or an item has become interactive).\n- Dull bestiary with the same art for all mobs in a cateogy. And no entries at all for many things.\n- Lack of fluff in the world.

A hand full of areas were easely recognizable as carbon copies of one another.\n- A bit nonsensical scaling of mobs.

However, in practice, things are a bit more lackluster. While I'm getting a definite NWN vibe, the controls for movement feel laggy and clunky. There's a decent bit of delay between clicking, the target circle showing up, and the characters actually moving. It jut doesn't feel as responsive as it could be.\n\nThe camera controls are also a bit annoying. Intuitively, one would think that moving the cursor to the edges of the screen would cause the camera to move when it's not actively following the characters. Nope. WASD. Very frustrating.\n\nThe story seems to be the usual fantasy fare, but it wasn't enough to really grab my attention. In NWN, you're essentially thrown into things. You're training at a guild that's safeguarding magical animals to help try and stop a plague that's ravaging the city of Neverwinter. Immediately, you know there's big stuff going down. SCL? So, I'm in a guild and I'm escorting a caravan and been having nightmares. Ok.\n\nI will say that I liked the enviroments and the character customization. It was realtivly painfree to create my character, and I like that there was enough explaination that I knew what each option would do. Handy since I've never played a DnD tabletop game and only know the bare basics about it.\n\nOverall, the game isn't bad, but it's not great. It's just kind of...Meh.

It also smacks of future console compatibility, this is probably why the game has been so dumbed down for kids and casual players, that just want a quick button mashing, Diablo 3 hack fest.\n\nMAIN FAILS\nMost of the D&D computer game fan base who buy this product will compare it to Neverwinter Nights 1&2 and the merits that made those dated titles so popular to this day. This fan base will be hoping for just a gfx upgrade of said examples. Wrong!\nThe devs have completely ignored those merits of technical depth, customisation, and of course, the excellent world building tools for dedicated servers.\nYes the game is pretty, however there is still more tech depth/variation in the development of one character class from NWN 1 or 2 than the entire game of Sword coast.\n\nCombat tactics? Very little. The very linear nature of the game and the lack of character action complexity provides little in the tactics department.\n\nThe Module creation mechanic is so basic it's a joke. Its pre generated terrain maps that you populate with the few objects/NPC’s available ingame.\n\nPrice. The game lacks content to warrant the high end bracket.\n\nPOSITIVES\nBetter gfx than NWN2, good music, good voice-overs, good classic HUD menu and controls, was stable with no obvious bugs.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nIf you want this pace of game just play Path of Exile, which is more complex than Diablo 3, and has an amazing character progression tree.\n\nIf you want a good D&D style game "Pillars of Eternity" still has no opposition.\n\nTHOUGHTS WHILE PLAYING\nI felt like I was play testing yet another early access game, but without the bugs.\nWith the Story to one side the lack of variation in standard game play had the "Rinse & repeat " effect on me. I almost went back in time to Gauntlet 1 from the 80's..."Valkyrie your life force is running out!"\n\nVery disappointed after waiting two years for this product. I am a massive D&D fan that hates to see this franchise damaged through short term cash-cow mentality.\nThis is not how the PC gameing market works for this genre. Games with depth make money if they look good for the long haul with good promise of further development, looking beyond two WEEKS of entertainment.","October 26, 2015","false","9.8"," 13 of 26 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","13","26","0","2"

It takes it's own, different twist on the RPG style from previous D&D games and I like that about it. The combat is fast, punchy, satisfying and looks great. The loot is varied and worth searching for. The environments are beautifully crafted and look awesome. The quests aren't anything to write home about, basically your standard RPG affair, but at least they're engaging so you don't lose interest. Overall I think it's a great game, and if you're going into it hoping for Bauldur's gate, you're going to be dissappointed, but if you look at it as  completely seperate game with new and different features (which it is! is it called Baulder's gate 3? NO!) you're definitely going to get a lot of enjoyment out of it.\n\nThis isn't a perfect game though. My main complaint is that it seems to have trouble running on my computer, which isn't really the game's fault, but If I can run Alien Isolation on almost max settings, I don't know why this game's frame rate dropps to 2 fps if the graphics are anything higher than the lowest possible settings. The other minor complaint I have is that your chracter says some dumb remark LITERALLY every single time you click to move. It's sooo anoying. If you're like me, you don't click terribly far away when you're waliking, because you want to see everything and search for loot, so every two seconds my paladin's saying "As you wish" or "I can do that". It gets really old really fast.\n\nThose problems aside, I still love this game. It's a great RPG and I can't wait to sink even more hours of my free time into it.","November 7, 2015","true","10.8"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

Sounds good, isn’t it?\nDon’t let yourself deceived! SCL lacks content, consistency and quality.\n\nLong review ahead. Prepare yourself before venturing forth.\n\nCharacter creation:\nYour stats and your class is coming from D&D. You can only select from 5 races (elf, half-elf, human, dwarf, halfing -> no half ork, tiefling, gnome etc.) and 6 classes (fighter, cleric, ranger, paladin, wizard, rogue -> no druid, warlock barbarian etc ; no prestige class either).\nThe „ability tree” where the real problem begins. Firstly it looks like like dragon age but if you go deeper, you see that there are not so much type of ability you can have. but full of upgrades to make your abilities slightly better (fireball 2 do little more damage than fireball 1). Abilities are not balanced, few of them has prerequisite of character level, most of them not.\n\nCampaign:\nCompleting SCL “epic” campaign main storyline and 98% side quests takes max 30 hours. The story is boring and inconsequent (though ACT 3 is „ok”). Very few side quest is interesting, others are boring dungeon crawl.\nYour alignment means nothing in this game. Daylight on open street your lawful good paladin can murder innocent people to get his peg leg.\nYour companions are quite good and the voice acting also convenient.\n\nCombat:\nThe combat is real time, where you can use pause to make decisions, but you don’t need to do that. SCL campaign offers no challenge at all (at normal difficulty). I didn’t have to load game because of a lost fight.\nYour characters will use all of their cooldown abilities (except heal) at start, then only basic attack for a long time because mostly you need to wait a lot to use your abilities once more. Later in the game you only need to use basic attack, passive skills (like one more attack per turn) and heal.\nThe most ridiculous is the instant revival. During the fight any type of character can revive a beaten teammate in 3 seconds.\n\nInventory/Loot:\nYour party has a common inventory (I like it), where your carrying capacity depends on strength, but not counting the armors and weapons are actually equipped (*facepalm).\nLoot system is so disappointing. Everywhere (not joking) you can obtain magic loot. Rogue can help you search much more if it not enough. Some equipments are overpowered, so it will play much more role to make your character stronger than your abilities.\n\nModule creation:\nForget the days of freedom. Prepare yourself for a module creator where you can’t do loot customizations, scripts and many other that could make your module original.\nNothing more than an easy to use dungeon crawling generator.\n\nOther problems (just listing):\n-no crafting\n-bugs (stuck at door-> load game; sometimes capes covers chest not your back etc)\n-mini loading before interaction with other persons and quest objects\n-graphic is so mediocre\n\nThe only one who did a great job at this game: Inon Zur The soundtack is best part of the game.","October 29, 2015","false","31.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","1"

I was hoping for something along the lines of Neverwinter Nights or the old inifinity engine games (but based on the new ruleset).  But despite the manufacturer's claims, this game bears no resemblance to D&D 5E.  None of the class features are present.  There are no spell slots or multiclassing.  "Leveling up" involves spending ability points to buy powers from skill trees, which are bland and uninspired.  Most powers are simply improved versions of earlier powers that do more damage.  And most of the skill trees are shared among all the classes.\n\nUnlike the older games, there is no resting or tactical use of limited resources.  Your characters can not die.  When reduced to 0 hit points, they can be revived without cost, even in the middle of combat.  The worst that can happen to you is to have all characters knocked out at once, at which point the "penalty" is restarting from the latest checkpoint.\n\nThe game most resembles the Baldur's Gate series which appeared on the consoles a few years back.  The main difference is that while those games featured fast paced action and good graphics, this game features dismal visuals, drawn out and boring combat, a slow and unresponsive user interface, and a camera that must be constantly rotated manually so you can see what is going on.\n\nOn the whole, I am very sorry that I wasted my money.

Turns take about 1 second or less and every character except maybe a shield bearing one in full plate armor is way too squishy and will get eviscerated in 1 second or less. To compensate this, they give you the ability to click-to-res where any character can res another just by clicking on it in 1 second or less so your best combat tactic are RES TRAINS !!!\nAlso there's no rest and no spell memorization system. Since spells and talents are not D&D based, eventual product of combat including rolls and other stuff (running away in combat actaully works!) has nothing to do with D&D either therefore causing attributes to lose meaning, not that you had much say on those creating a character (can't put less than 8 in any attribute).\n\n- Questing are like of a generic MMO, grocery list style. Except attribute-check dialog options, you literally have no other options except talking with the NPC that has a ! sign on its head and even then, dialogue options are limited and generally doesn't back your alignment specific actions.\n\n- Co-op multiplayer is a mess: When played with 2 people, host controls 3 characters and guest controls 1 which is a total failure since one guy has to control 3x the amount of characters in a realtime game which causes one guy in a position to do a lot of stuff in a short duration while the other waits. You can't change control of companions. Also host decides every dialogue option related to main story while the guest is only watching. Guest can only interact with side-quests or vendors. Also pause system with short rounds is a total mess.\n\n- Friendly AI is a mess with no way to set it up how you want it to play: Characters in your party will keep on casting random stuff if you don't micro-manage their every action and you have no control over it,\n\n- DM Mode dungeon crawl is an original idea but seeing where the DM is really kills all the immersion.\n\nTLDR; Do not buy, go purchase Divinity: Original Sin instead if you wanna have co-op campaign fun or play an actual mmo if you wanna do Dungeon Crawl.","October 22, 2015","false","0.3"," 19 of 38 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","19","38","3","0"

It might not warrant such negativity if it didn't claim to be something it's not, and then perhaps people would have a case saying some are being overly critical, but this game has D&D in the title and nowhere in the game. Done to death skill trees, limited class options, module creating tools that aren't close to Neverwinter Nights, and limited character options place SCL solidly in role-playing light, action RPG genre, of which there are hordes to choose from.\nThe main story is entertaining and fairly well written, and of course playable with friends of your choosing, but true role-playing in the rest of the game is severly absent. From what I've heard of creating your own modules, player characters don't get to say anything beyond "we accept" or "not right now," how the heck do you create a story doing that? Unless the game adds a lot of free conentto open up possible creativity with it, I can't give it a positive.","October 20, 2015","false","0.6"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","12","24","0","0"

With VERY limited character creation options, (Only six classes and five races) bare bones CRPG mechanics that feel more like the developers haven't played anything in the genre before, and a slow crawl at the beginning made me ponder wether or not this was worth continuing on with and missing out on the possiblity of getting a refund. It isn't bad by any means, and I for one like how they didn't go with a direct translation of 5e and instead used it as a back bone for it's own skill system. However after thinking about it I honestly could not see myself playing onward until they added more races and classes. Not to mention the price for admission of 35 bucks at the time of purchase made me sort of realize getting a refund would be best.\n\nSo yeah, wait for a price drop/sale of like 50% or something and for them to add more races and classes to the game.

No, it never reaches the storytelling heights of previous D&D based games such as Planescape: Torment or Baldur's Gate II.  Nor does it have the flexible module creation of the Neverwinter Nights games, instead opting for an easier to use, but rather limited dungeon and campiagn creator.  But that is okay.\n\nAt it's core SCL is a dungeon crawling game similar to Diablo or Torchlight with some D&D inspired elements added to it and a small bit of roleplaying akin to the infinty engine games.  When it was first annouced, many people saw it as a throwback to the inifinity engine games and were seeing it as a response to Pillars of Eternity and Torment: Tides of Numenera (both excelent games), a sort of "official successor", but SCL turned out to be radically different.  Instead it falls somewhere in between Diablo and Baldur's Gate, with a dash of Icewind Dale and Neverwinter Nights.\n\nThe story is good, not great, but good.  It aims for a sort of childish wonder, poking fun at the cliches that it holds while still presenting a compelling narrative.  It may not be Obsidian, but it is deeper and more enjoyable than most dungeon crawlers.\n\nThe music is fantastic.  Inon Zur always delivers an incredible soundtrack and this may be one of his best works.  Combined with solid voice acting and awesome ambient sounds it is punchy and atmospheric.  Seriously, this may have one of my favorite soundtracks in recent memory.\n\nOverall, it is not a bad game per say, it is actually a lot of fun to play and has some really solid writting that pokes fun at itself.  That said, I don't think it is what people were expecting and at the begining it was rather limited, but due to feedback and constant updates, the game gets better all the time.  I would actually reccomend it to anyone looking for a fun way to hack and slash with friends or wants to run a digital campaign with more dungeons and less freedom.\n\n7/10 (6/10 before updates)","February 20","true","1.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Only your active party memebers gain experience which is practical in theory but encourages the player to pick 4 from the start and simply stick with them all the way through for maximum leveling.\n-the save system is dreadful, one save, not just one quick save, one save for the whole campaign.  This is a major flaw which I saw a dev say was a Steam cloud restriction which it isn't.  There should obviously be limitless local saves like every other RPG.\n\nIt comes across as amateurish and suffers from not being wholely D&D or wholely something else.  Hybrids always suffer.

I only have a few complaints.  One has to do with the in-game map.  When you open the map, you can't move it around the screen.  This seems more like a rough edge that just hasn't been addressed yet.  Another has to do with monsters auto leveling to your character level.  I know this is due to the system of generating dungeons for players and DM's to use, however I've never been a fan of this mechanic.  Then there is the matter of not being able to have multiple saves during the single player campaign.  They really should change this... it just seems lazy.  And finally, the game only has a handful of abilities for each class to learn (feats, skills, spells, etc- all rolled together), but the choices are fairly limited.  This is most noticeable with Wizards.\n\nOverall very much worth the price if you enjoy this style of overhead, pause-tactical, party based RPG.  However, not a must have for people that aren't already fans of this sort of thing.  I look forward to future content, and hope to see a modding community take off.\n\n**SPOILER EDIT**\n\n\n\nBefore the final battle, you are warned that there is no going back.  Normally this would not be a big deal, but since you only have a single save game you are stuck.  So be warned, finish all your side quests since you are _forced_ to start over after the final battle.","January 17","true","111.6"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

From a somewhat nostalgic viewpoint, it brings back that great, genuinely fun feel that was seen in D&D games like Icewind Dale. As far as play-value goes, this game actually does pretty well. There's a relatively long story with very enjoyable companions who each have their own eccentricities and humorous quirks, providing good banter at times. If you finish the story, don't fret: Besides DM mode (which, as of this point, I'm actually yet to try out), there are still Dungeon Crawl and Module modes. Dungeon Crawl lets you create a party, either online co-op or with any of the characters you have actually made, and puts them in a randomly generated dungeon that fits specs for enemies, environment, and bosses that you choose. If that's not enough, there are still Modules which are being added and are played as miniature campaigns.\nFrom a single player perspective, this game is genuinely good. The pause-input decisions-unpause mechanic works well and allows you, with enough effort and foresight, to come up with effective kill team procedures. The character development is enjoyable, too, as there is a plethora of powers and abilities from which to choose. The only downside here, though, is the distinct lack of Multi-Classing that is often seen as the stamp of D&D games.\nAnother good thing is that, for a player like me who has a very low-end PC, the game is still very playable. The only lag on my low-end PC occurs in open areas, whereas dungeons - where most of the game occurs - are smooth. Moreover, lag is actually irrelevant in a combat style where one can pause and input commands.\nPersonally, I struggled adapting to the D&D 5.0 system at first, having only played much older versions, but I picked it up quickly enough to avoid any real issues.\nThe biggest negative to this game is a vast array of glitches relating to loading screens. The forums are riddled with issues about non-loading loading screens and issues thereafter; however, there is an easy fix for those of you concerned: before loading, drop your graphics settings or window the game heavily, then as soon as you're in-game, put them back up to where you want them. This works pretty much every single time, so there's no actual negative there.\n\nOverally, I'd give this game an easy 80%. While it may seem a push to buy it full price, if there is ever any discount on it, it is definitely worth its weight.","January 21","true","84.6"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

I have also played out the first section in coop mode. I have not played with the DM tools.\n\nShort Review\nA party based roleplaying game that despite a host of minor issues is none the less an enjoyable romp. The highlights for me were the humour within the character dialogue and the boss fights. The low point is definitely the user interface which was very cumbersome to use.\n\nLong Review\nIt's probably worth mentioing that the last time I played AD&D was with the first ruleset so I have no knowledge of the current ruleset this game claims to follow. I have played Baldur's Gate and was not imparticularly impressed with that game. My initial reaction to this game is that it is an updated version of Baldur's Gate with similar game mechanics and humour but with much updated graphics. However, having said that I have to say that I prefer Sword Coast Legends to Baldur's Gate.\n\nYou play this game in third person with the ability to zoom in and out and adjust the camera angle. To be hnest I played most of the game scrolled out to the furthest level and could have done with the ability to scroll out futher.\n\nInteraction with the important NPCs takes you into a still graphic with audio to listen to and text based options to make a decision on how to respond to the NPC. I found the quality of the audio to be pretty good.\n\nThe first time you come across using a control there are tutorial hints displayed. I found these useful and TBH within 10-15 minutes had the basics matered. However, there is a lot of depth to the interface that did require some trial and error to figure out.\n\nI found the audio and graphics to play fine on my low end gaming machine and had no issues related to hardware performance that I can recall.\n\nThere is certainly some replay value in the game, particularly to play it as co-op and try out the DM tools. I doubt whether I'd replay the solo campaign again.\n\nProsThe humour is very much my cup of tea\nI like the ability to scroll well ahead of the party\nI found the storyline engaging and enjoyable\nThe boss fights were excellent\nThe AI was good enough to mean the charcters do not need to be micro managed but be aware occasionally they get snagged moving from place to placeConsI find the camera angle a little restrictive\nThere is a significant delay inbetween moving from one map to another\nThe map view is not scrollable\nUnlimited ammo. I liked having to manage how many arrows I carried in Baldur's Gate\nThe party members do not move on the map view\nThe messages disappear too quickly off screen and clicking on them does does not take me to the relevant entry/item\nWhen the journal is updated there is no indication as to which entries have been updated since you last opened it\nThe journal is pretty cumbersome to use to the point I pretty much ignored it in the end\nWhen interacting with merchants the default view is to list items by the lowest cost. This means that all the "rubbish" stuff is listed first\nAllocating abilitiies on levelling up is instantaneous.

In my opinion, beauty and gameplay are second to functionality. For now, and sadly, my thumb is down. Let's see if something good happens in the future, however.\n\nI played and finished a lot of D&D based games like this (Baldur's Gate 1 EE and 2, IceWind Dale 2, Neverwinter Nights 1 and 2 etc.) and non D&D (Dragon Age 1 & 2, Divinity: OS, etc., Pillars of Eternity) and as a whole this is probably the one of the best of its kind (but not as good as PoE, for example).\n\nPROS:\nFine plot, classical CRPG with some advanced graphical effects, there is pretty anything you could expect from the best party based, turn based tactical rpgs around.\n\nCONS:\nCritical level bugs are still there (example: full screen mode switch only working with a keybord shortcut you discover from the forums - alt+enter for pc's if i'm not wrong);\nLittle to no graphics optimization (example: the whole graphics and text get blurry if you do not choose the best screen resolution for your device, so you are forced).\nOnly one 'save slot'.

All of the races and abilites are exactly from DnD but the gameplay is much easier then what you would be use to. However the storyline and quests are exteremly fun, and the characters are some of the best I have experienced in an rpg in a very long time. There are items galor for customzing your characters. The only way you will hate this game is if you go in expecting a True DnD experiance. The fact is this is an RPG inspired by DnD with many elements taken from it. Moral of this story?

Despite the D&D name, the core gameplay also fails to impress, as it ditches the tried-and-true adaptations of past D&D games in favor of generic, cooldown-based ARPG fare that feels more at home in a Dragon Age or Diablo game than D&D. The combat is moderately engaging while playing solo, but when you're playing multiplayer (and thus only controlling a single party member) it quickly becomes apparent that the game is designed like an ARPG, with fast cooldowns on powers, rapid normal attacks, respawning, and wave-based encounters that completely annihilate any semblance of the tactical gameplay inspired by TotSC's top-down party-based premise.\n\nAs for the meat of the game--the single player campaign--good Gods, is it dull. Just about every possible D&D campaign cliche is dumped at you within seconds of loading up a new game, and once you start playing... you're bombarded with fetch-quests and imminently forgettable dialog. I haven't played the game to the end yet (I will amend this review upon doing so), but what I've seen so far is much more at the level of say, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance than Baldur's Gate proper.\n\nBeyond that, there are a host of other problems: the UI is incredibly poorly designed, with some of the most tedious-to-navigate menus I've seen this side of a Paradox Grand Strategy. There's also a noticeable delay between clicking on a button, and that input registering--which is always annoying. Speaking of which: did you know that every time you enter or leave dialog with an NPC, the screen will fade-out to black and then fade back in as the camera adjusts to slightly different angles? Yeah: that's a thing.\n\nSword Coast Legends offers none of the grand narrative or character of the Baldur's Gates, none of the engrossing user-creation tools of Neverwinter Nights, and doesn't even try to emulate the systemic fidelity of the Icewind Dales. In short, for most hardened CRPG gamers, SCL is an immensely disappointing game that completely fails to live up to even a single aspect of its potential.\n\nSo: why the recommendation?\n\nBecause, ultimately, I think the only thing that really matters is whether or not a game is good on its own merit. Is Sword Coast Legends the game it could have been, or perhaps should have been? No. Absolutely not.\n\nBut does not being good make a thing bad? You are welcome to think so; I do not. Sword Coast Legends offers a fairly generic experience, true, and has a number of minor problems that hamper enjoyment... it's clear that the developers don't really have much (if any) experience making CRPGs. But nothing really sticks out as being awful, either. There are plenty of bad games out there--I should know, I've played many of them (how many of us can boast to having beaten Daikatana?)--and, while disappointing, SCL isn't bad. Sometimes, I don't want to get too involved in a game. Sometimes, I just want to play around in an archetypal high fantasy setting that doesn't demand I become too involved with the characters or story. And, sometimes, I want to do that with friends.\n\nAnd, as you can likely guess, Sword Coast Legends provides exactly that. There are few CRPGs that offer cooperative multiplayer, and of those fewer still are worth playing. So, yeah: if you've tired of the great classic CRPGs of yore, or find yourself in-between the big CRPGs of today (the Divinities and Eternities and Torments), or simply want to relax and have some low-intensity fun with a friend or two (or three)... Sword Coast Legends is for you.","October 20, 2015","true","3.0"," 32 of 65 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","32","65","0","0"

As other reviews have stated already the D&D brand is tantamount to a sham.\n\nCharacter creation feels stale. Things are not explaned in any detail nor are they intuitive in any way. An atheist cleric or paladin just seems odd - deities seems tagged on and doesn't really provide anything. The possibilities for customizations are very low - a mere 5 classes are presented to the user and you have little influence on how these are configured. Moreover the characters look cartoonish in appearance, which annoys me for some reason.\n\nI have only had about an hour of actual gameplay and there is a reason for that. The controls are confusing and annoying. Maybe it is a Linux bug, but you cannot scroll by moving the mouse to the egde as usual. It feels like a tedium to play the game and it shouldn't.\n\nThis game is NOT BG or NWN in any way or form. If you expect that kind for game then pass on it. I was fortunately able to get my money refunded. I may try to pick this up in a summer sales and give it a go in a different light.","October 22, 2015","false","1.5"," 21 of 43 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","21","43","0","0"

I have not played and do not have any real interest in playing the multiplayer campaign.\n\nProbably the biggest plus to this game is the story. The plot drew me in from the very beginning, and I can already sense that the stakes are very high a couple of minutes into it. The pacing is faster than most fantasy RPGs that I’ve played, and there is a sense of urgency through every progression of the main quest. The characters in general are quite well fleshed out, especially your companions. You will encounter some unexpected twists with one or two of them. The banters are quite clever and I feel they have just the right touch of humor.\n\nThe combat will be hit and miss, depending on what you’re expecting. While the overall feel of the game is similar to the traditional isometric infinity engine, the combat mechanics remind me of Dragon Age Origins. Casting spells and using special abilities have cooldown periods. There is no need to rest and similar to DAO, you are provided a camping ground where you can converse with your companions and further their own individual quests. Personally, I feel it is easier to navigate through battles with the current system and I am honestly having a lot of fun with it. Also, most of the time, the battles are fairly easy which to me is actually a welcome relief as I’ve been playing some really tough RPG games lately. I forgot how good it felt to just relax and breeze through enemy encounters. There are complaints that the combat is nowhere near close to table top D&D as is promised. Well, if you’re that serious about those pen-and-paper rules than pay no heed to my opinion on combat since my enjoyment of the game does not hinge on the ruleset at all.\n\nOutside of combat, other game mechanics such as navigation can be irritating at times. It takes a long while for me to get used to the process of scrolling through an area. Even rotating the view can be a chore. The area map screen is almost useless since it does not give you the usual option of clicking on a spot and moving your party to that spot. Also if you’re in a pretty huge area, your map does not zoom out which makes it absolutely impractical for you to use, since often, specific locations that you need to go to is not visible on the map. I’m sure the devs will come around and improve on this sooner or later.\n\nNow for my biggest complaint; the save system. It is not as bad as having no manual save but it’s still pretty bad. Why? You’re only given one save slot. It is especially made worse with the fact that this game has just been released and there will inevitably be bugs in it. Once you encounter one that is serious, there are no options for you to go back a couple of steps and avoid the bug. You are basically stuck and will have to start over. I have so far encountered no serious bug yet but I’m a bit nervous at this point. The devs probably made this decision because of multiplayer, which, for gamers like me who is only in it for the SP experience is definitely not on. I really hope they make some serious changes on this matter.\n\nIn conclusion, the story and lore alone already won me over. I just hope no progress killing bug will change that opinion anytime soon ^_^\n\n8/10.","October 19, 2015","true","40.0"," 21 of 43 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","21","43","0","0"

I haven't finished the single player campaign yet and I'm not terribly far in but what I've seen of it so far is pretty good.\n\nI haven't done any group play as far as playing with other players yet but when playing the dungeon crawl aspect with the NPCs companions it's been pretty fun so far.\n\nI think the DM tools are fairly good as well and are pretty easy to understand/use. You can either let the random mob placement put in the NPCs or manually put them in or a combination depending on how much effort you want to put in.\n\nOverall I think the game is worth picking up just for the ~40 hour single player campaign, plus however much of the multiplayer you enjoy.\n\nNow for some 'cons' to the game. Some of these SCL has stated that they are going to add/fix going forward, based on player feedback/request, they just didn't have time to do so before launch. Considering the amount of content they've added during Headstarts and in the community updates to date from player feedback they've shown, at least to me, that they seem sincere in their desires to do so.\n\n-While the variety of dungeon sets to use is pretty decent the lack of being able to fully customize a dungeon by creating one tile by tile was a bit of a surprise.\n-Two of the monster sets aren't able to be set for a dungeon you create, the troll and ogre sets.\n-On the overland maps you can't zoom out properly, which is a bit of a problem on the larger ones because you can't see where the mob placements are and it's hard to properly build the maps.\n-For me the complete lack of any crafting in the game is a bit of a draw back, being able to create magic items and such is a pretty interesting aspect of D&D.\n-The lack of spell options for wizards is a bit of a let down for me, the immense versatility of the class is it's main draw for me. I'm unsure how 5e handles wizard spells since I play 3.5 and I understand that the limitations of creating and balancing an online game make such things difficult .\n-Not all the D&D classes, or even the base classes, are in at launch. They plan to add them in the future but weren't able to for launch. (barbarian, monk, bard are missing, and I think Warlock is considered a base class now also?)\n-The game is missing some iconic creatures, like dragons. Not a deal breaker and they are planning on adding more in the future but still bit of a downer not to have dragons in a D&D game.\n-They don't allow you to make/hand out custom items as a DM/Dungeon designer. There are pros and cons to this. They went this route for balance reasons so DMs couldn't just give +10 Vorpal, Keen, etc etc weapons and the like. I respect their decision and the reasons behind it, but feal like decisions like these should be up to individual DMs and not be blanket dissallowed.\n-the absence of branching dialogue is a pretty sore point for many campaign creators. SCL has stated numerous times that they want to put it in, they just weren't able to get it in for launch. (this and Tile by Tile dungeon creation were the two top requests by the headstart community)\n\nSummary:\nGoing into this game I new that the idea was to make a space where Dms could make a dungeon and players could join it and the DMs could run a campaign through it. They'd also made it clear from the begining that it was based off 5e Faerune and not D&D itself. I think a lot of people got really excited about the game and thought it was straight up digitized D&D 5e in a virtual space and that's why there are so many who dislike the game.\n\nThe game is perfectly able to pull off what the designers said it would be able to do and they have been very open about their desires to add those things the community has asked for and responding to feedback. There has been quite a few things added already as a direct result of player requests for instance. They've already added well over 200 assets and 4 new areas to the game just in the couple weeks since launch for instance.\n\nWith these things in mind and the presence of a pretty nice ~40 hour single player campaign I feel the game is well worth the money and that the SCL team has earn the benefit of the doubt that they'll continue to deliver what they've said they would and what the community requests as far as new features/updated features. Your mileage may vary depending on whether you're looking for a D&D-esque game or a pen and paper 5e replacement.","November 19, 2015","true","25.9"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","0"

It has a really nice classic D&D type story and the questing is satisfying.  Its a good combo of quests that tell you exactly what to do and quests that give you an idea of what you need to do and let you figure it out.  I'm finding the combat very satisfying so far.  It has a good amount of challenge in the beginning leading to many fights where I need to control all the members in my party.  It has a more action packed feel than stuff like Baldur's Gate.  Its kind of like a combo between Diablo type games (lots of hotbar moves with cool downs) and Baldur's Gate type games (pause with space bar, queue actions for specific party members), which I am finding pretty cool so far.  So far the only negatives I am noticing are small optimization issues/oversites that don't detract from the game in my opinion (single save file, every time I start the game I have to put the resoultion back to 1440p, weird stuff like that).

I had a bit of disposable income this week to throw at a new game, so I took a closer look at some of the reviews and noticed that a lot of them were complaints about deviations from the core rule set which didn't bother me much. I do not regret this purchase at all. I'm only a little ways in, but I can tell you the voice acting is awesome, dungeons look great with lots of detail, secrets and traps, while graphics look just a little dated, open areas still manage to look beautiful and they're interesting too in unexpected ways,\n\nDevelopers communicate with their audience and patch where required with community content packs which is what I think gamers expect these days after years of feeding the AAA machine money and getting silence in return,\n\nHave not had a look at the multiplayer or DM aspect of the game, living in Australia can make getting people in a party hard, but hopefully that should change once the game gets a little more polish.\n\nIf you enjoyed BG and all the rest, don't buy into this expecting copy paste experience. Attribute points are still there, but perks have been replaced with skill trees and no multiclassing (but access to multiple skill trees per a class), AI companions can be controlled by player or the AI and they have their own voice acting and direct role in the story. Oh, and abilities and spells are cooldown now so no resting after every few encounters (which I kind of like), there's a few classes missing but I'm sure (I hope) they will be added down the line.\n\nIf you're on the fence, give it a little more time. Certainly could use a little more optimization and polish, but I think it's a little gem that will see a lot of improvement over time.

I absolutley LOVE D&D 5th edition, and I believe they have translated it incredibly well into a video game.\n\nI loved Baldur's Gate 1 & 2, Neverwinter Nights and Dragon Age: Origins. This game falls somewhere between those and it is awesome.\n\nPeople don't realize that you can't fully translate a tabletop D&D experience to a video game, because the core element of D&D is roleplaying. The combat mechanics and skill checks are fun as heck, sure, and this game does that in spades.\n\nThe NPCs that you meet are well done and make you care for them.\n\nAgain, I'm only halfway through, but I would give this game a solid 87/100.","October 25, 2015","true","26.0"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

My understanding is it's a 5.0 tabletop thing.  STATS cap out at 20.  I now have no real reason to level any more, and thus no real reason to play.  What's the goal here, a 20/20/20/20/20/20 toon?  If so, what is the point?  Now I'm sorry I spent the money.  A rogue with a DEX of 20 and no more.  Fail.\n\n\nGraphics: Divinity Original Sin style\nRuleset: 5.0\nPlot of main campaign: Meh.  Not terrible, but nothing new under the sun or compelling.\nSetting: Start out with a caravan travelling between Neverwinter and Luskan.\nCharacter building: Most closely resembles character customization in Dragon Age I.\nRecommendation:  Sure, maybe, if you're really bored.  Price is still too high though, for solo play anyway.\n\nI am a 3.5 fiend.  Still play DDO and am replaying NWN2 because they hit my minimum graphics requirements and I just love building characters.  I can build a character, save it, and stop playing altogether.  It's central and it keeps the game fresh.  I think DDOs staying power rests with the fact that you can rebuild a character endlessly through the 3.5 ruleset and get a different game each and every time.  You can't get that with other games.\n\nThat said, I cannot play Neverwinter online.  I hate 4.0.  No choice, no variation, no "newness" to each character.  Which equals crap replayability.  Moving on.\n\nSword Coast Legends uses 5.0.  It's not terrible, but it's not 3.5.  No feats, no cross-classing.  My rogue uses DEX for trap skills instead of INT.  Previously finesse-able weapons are just straight out  DEX based.  No feats that I've seen.  STAT pts with level ups which you choose to place.   What my rogue gets is access to 8 ability trees, including: skills similar to the 3.5 list, though dumbed down; things like "scoundrel", "assassin", "thief"; something bard-ish; something ranged; general stuff like "two weapon fighting".  As I said, most closely resembles Dragon Age character customization of a rogue.","March 27","true","32.5"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

It's good.  It's not quite as good as earlier D&D games, but it's pretty good.  I've mostly played campaign mode with two other people, and multiplayer is the only way to play this to me, a completely customized party of you and your friends.  The story is actually pretty decent as well.  Though if you're a D&D fan you'll be thinking that you didn't really visit 'all that much' of the Sword Coast, and you're right.  The gameplay is very modern, buttons/cooldowns/etc so the hardcore D&D fans seem to dislike that when compared to older games, but I didn't mind, it makes for easier to learn/get into gameplay IMO.  Some of the 'boss' fights are intriguing.  Some can even be challenging (if you're not paying attention and just clicking attack).  My biggest complaint is actually that only the game host gets to make most of the big choices in the game, and not the other party members.  Perhaps a voting system should be in place for choices.\n\nIs it the Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale of yesteryear? Nope.  They have attempted to modernize it, and they succeed at a lot of things, and failed in others, but really, as much as I love those old games, they had issues too.  I think this attempt, and thus the game, is a good effort.  Though I hope they release some mroe updates, and  MORE CAMPAIGNS for it.  Hopefully free campaigns for those of us that paid a fairly mainsteam price for this game at launch.\n\nSo that's my two cents.  After all the updates the game is much more playable, and enjoyable than it was at launch.  I recommend playing with a group that loves the D&D lore and lands to increase the joy (Because the NPC allies are a little dumb).  Does it play a bit more like WoW, and a bit less like Icewind Dale? Yeah, but that's how it goes these days.\n\nOverall I'd say a 7 out of 10.","December 6, 2015","true","28.8"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

Fortunately, a free weekend is going on at the time of this writing, accompanied by a half off sale.\n\nI am five hours in, and am enjoying the game.  It's not the constant slugfest of Diablo 3 (which has its place) nor is it the dialog heavy game like Pillars of Eternity (which has its place) but it kind of snuggles up somewhere right in the middle.\n\nCombat can often be done with little attention, but if you let your guard down at the wrong time it can bite you.  It doesn't have a 5E flavor to me, though; it seems more like 4E, with rapid cool downs and plentiful heals after each encounter, like a cinematic style.   This isn't a bad thing, though, in a video game, as it keeps the flow going.  It often bothers me in other games to have to pitch camp for no other reason than to gain spells back.\n\nThe graphics aren't mind blowing, but are certainly adequate.  If you have tried Neverwinter (the MMO) you will have an idea.\n\nI haven't dug too deeply into the user generated content yet, but I have checked it out.  The options sure do seem plentiful.  Don't know yet whether or not much of it can be done solo or if you need to group up, and I don't know how popular grouping up is.  I hope to tap into that, but it's a busy time and I haven't yet.  The fact that the option exists is very attractive to me.\n\nAnyhoo . . . I think the game suffers from early launchitis, and the early reviews reflect that, but the reviews that come after should be given more credence, as apparantly much has been addressed in the community packs.  I am midway into the free weekend, but I will be purchasing, just don't know if I will get the deluxe version or not.\n\nNow I must go have harsh words with my wife.  Her influence is my only excuse I have for using the word 'snuggle' in a review.\n\nEdited after 20 hours:\n\nA couple addendums to my review.\n\nAfter creating several characters to get a feel for the different classes, I made a rogue that is a ball to play but has had a couple issues loading.  After about an hour in to the campaign, it would not load, and I started over.  It had the same issue later on, but I exited the game and came back and let it sit and it ended up loading.  This is the only character that has had this issue.\n\nOne thing I really like, and has a real D&D feel, is that leveling is slow.  It took hours of play to reach fourth level.  That does not mean that I felt weak the whole time, quite the contrary: Each level up was significant and memorable.\n\nI also didn't feel invulnerable or super-powered.  There are some battles that I had to avoid and times when I was glad I was able to talk or buy my way out.  My wife called me a wuss more than once.\n\nThe more I play, the more of a D&D vibe I sense from it.  Concessions have been made for the sake of the medium, but that can't be avoided.\n\nAnyhoo, I'm glad I grabbed it, and I haven't even done multi-player yet.  Looking forward to that experience.","December 18, 2015","true","23.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","46","6","13","3","0"

Still, I dove into Sword Coast Legends hoping for a gem in the rough and I soon found the rich and immersive, and often humorous storyline. I never take jabs at a company who put out a game with only a small development team, and I will not do so with the SCL team. The developers respond quickly to issues and have set a path to make SCL a force to be reckoned with. After the CP1 release, I found that most all major bugs were hashed out and the level up trees became a bit more immersive, if you don't mind doing a little leg work. The true gem here lies in the DM mode and the ability to create custom adventures, and then run them for adventurers as a RL DM would. There is also a dungeon crawl aspect, allowing a group of adventurers to delve through tireless dungeons (which can also be DM'd). I suspect this will receive much attention from the devs as I found it truly amazing myself, and for anyone who does not care to craft DM based dungeons.\nIn close, I think the community was too harsh in their initial opinion of SCL, especially after only a few hours of gameplay after release day. There is so much potential with this game, and the dev team has already hinted at some of the truly amazing content they will release by Christmas. Buy this game; it is nothing like Diablo (thank God). It plays and feels closer to Shadows of Amn mixed with aspects of Neverwinter Nights.","November 17, 2015","true","270.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","1"

As much as I can relate to that disappointment, because sadly this game doesnt follow the real AD&D ruleset for the most part, one still should be able to enjoy a game for what it actually is and not for the thing one desperately wants it to be.\n\nI'm a HUGE AD&D-games fanboy myself (on computer ofc, theres not much Pen'n'Paper where i live ^^), BG2 still being one of my favourite games of all time and i loved all the old Infinity-Engine games! And I'm enjoying my time with this game very much.\n\nThere is a lot of love for detail and world creation apparent here and theres a ton of content present: Many locations, quests, items, funny situations. The score is very nice and i personally loved all the voice acting (esp. Larethar).\nIts not on par with the big ones up there (BG1/2, PT e.g.) but that doesnt mean this isnt a lot of fun!\n\nIf you are a cRPG fan, do yourself a favour and give this one a try....don't believe the haters.","November 22, 2015","true","55.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The Campaign/Module development tools have seen regular updates in recent weeks and by now there are a lot of player made adventures to be had once you've finished the core campaign.  I've not played on a multiplayer basis with a live DM so far but forum feedback suggests that it's a load of fun playing with a group of friends and less fun playing with random people.\n\nThere has been a lot of negative press for this game since launch but to me this was mainly due to the developer's trying to please too many different rpg gaming audiences at the same time which then had too many compromises.  By now the game is  seeing a lot of development from some clever guys writing mods which are giving the game a much more 'D&D' feel and at the same time the developers are making continuous improvements based on player comment.  In some ways SCL is a work in progress, but this is part of the charm and for me it adds to the fun since the community chat becomes part of the overall experience.\n\nHaving played many CRPG's over many decades this game has held my attention for far longer than many others both past & present.   The game is lots of fun in it's current form and definetely has a huge potential with the current development path.   If you enjoy the spontenaiety & imagination which 'pen & paper' rpg's require then this game is being developed with you in mind but if you're the type of person who demands a perfect gaming experience straight from the box then SCL is probably not for you ...... yet.","November 25, 2015","true","39.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The lack of character to the game and story are inherent in the material. The limited class list, reduced ability trees, all of this is 5th Edition perfectly translated.\nThe combat is dull and repetative. As is 5E table top combat. I think the game is judged harshly here but the problem is the core experience is flawed in and of itself, but that comes from the pen and paper side, not the computer side.\n\n2) This game was rushed out the door, even with a delayed release date. Simply put- for a game that's supposed to have a built in DM engine as well as a single player experience, there is a significant lack of customization and variation in the tools and assets included. You cannot make too many kinds of encounters, and the tools are limited to say the least.\nThe game feels like it was shipped missing 100 to 200 hours of more art and voice assets still to be included. That's not explicitly said, but promises of the pre-release articles were for a much more robust experience than was delivered. The voices and character customization options are not only slim and but widely vary. Female characters come in only 4 flavors - Smart, dumb, mean, and smart-alec. Nothing in-between, just polar opposites.\nThe conspiracy theorists might say this is for DLC, but I don't think the devs actually had the time to get done what they originally promised in the pitches.\n\nD&D veterans will findthings to enjoy here, but this isn't Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter Nights in the least.","October 25, 2015","true","16.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The Devs don't care, even with their (at the time of writing) Mixed review score of 58% (EDIT: 52% one month later) positive looming over their heads.  The general public doesn't care, as it has either moved on and stopped following the game in bitter disappointment, or is a small dedicated fanbase who like the generic cookie cutter hack n' slash gameplay and can't stop touting how awesomely generic the gameplay is.  And people who are considering SCL as a purchase option are just going to give a look at the Mixed reviews and walk away without actually reading my review anyways.\n\nI gave SCL time to update, but as near as I can tell, the so-called "Community Content Packs" contain none of the features that I saw most requested by the community, and did nothing to alleviate my own complaints about the game.  The devs are sticking to their guns on this poorly designed game (and really, it is without a doubt the designers and producers on this one that should be sacked), and letting their deceptive marketing team flavor all of the sales pitches with buzzwords to make it sound like they care what the people think.  Thanks for barfing on my plate and telling me it is a delicacy.\n\nEDIT:  For the record, none of the people on my friends list who own this game are even willing to play it anymore.  It started as a four-pack purchase, and now the mere mention of it makes people angry.  Makes me wonder how eager the community will be to gobble up N-Space's next project, whatever it may be.  Their crack marketing team should be able to scrape up at least a few sorry investors with a low Wisdom score for one more digital travesty.\n\nSECOND EDIT:  Rock Paper Shotgun released an article (March 30, 2016) stating that Sword Coast Legends Developer N-Space has closed and laid off all employees.  It remains to be seen what will happen to the game, but lets face it, it was dead already, or they'd have had the money to keep their doors open.  I fully anticipate all their promises of further development will not be taken up by any future teams that may take up the reins.  Maybe someday Wizards of the Coast will put their Intellectual Property in the hands of someone their fanbase can have faith in, and a worthy product will be produced, but rest assured, this is not it.","December 8, 2015","false","8.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","1"
