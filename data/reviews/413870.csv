I loved every moment of playing this title. This game is not for the faint of heart- if violence is not your thing then turn back now. While things don’t ever get too graphic or gory it’s still enough to turn some off. There is strong language as well as some creepy plot elements, but if you’re into visual novels of a different breed then please read on.\n\nOur main character is Suoh, who has just killed his boss by mistake during an argument. Panicked, he reaches out to one of his co-workers who is involved in some shady business. This dangerous young gentleman, Markus, saves Suoh’s bacon but wants something in return, and he introduces Suoh to Kurasu, a mob boss. What unfolds next is our protagonist's descent into a world of money, lies, violence, and ultimately murder. One fatal mistake sends Suoh’s life spiraling out of control.\n\nThe story continues as Suoh advances in Karasu’s criminal organization that Markus has dragged him into. Suoh has battles with himself, his actions and whatever set of morals he has left. Midst all the chaos, Suoh has two shining beacons of hope, his twin sister Sara and a girl he meets in his new line of work named Misa. There are two endings in the game, one for Sara and one for Misa. As our “hero” progresses down either path, he is plagued by doubt that he can lead such a violent lifestyle and still have happiness.\n\nAlong with a gripping story, the game has mood setting music and well made artwork. The art has a few up and down moments in terms of quality but overall the game is visually appealing. The CG scenes are what stand out the most, guiding readers along. The game does suffer from a few typos that should have been caught in post-production but they are few and far between and not enough to ruin the game.\n\nWhen I started getting deeper into Sickness I personally found it to be a lot like the TV show Dexter, a story about a man who is a serial killer trying to have a normal life and battle the cruel urge he names his “Dark Passenger.” Here, Souh names his “Sickness” and his mental state even brings him physical pain and delusions. I loved the story, I loved how different it was from conventional slice-of-life visual novels or overdone love stories, I was at the edge of my seat during each chapter wanting to know what happens next. Despite the dark nature of this title, I would wholeheartedly recommend Sickness to anyone that can handle it.\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","January 25","true","19.7"," 52 of 55 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","52","55","0","2"

There are many choices which can be made and depending on your choices it will change the outcome of the story.\n\nThe story\nThe pacing of the story is alright not too fast or not too slow for me but some people may find it slow because at certain points it gets a little boring [this is on my own personal judgement], I loved the touch of realism because it really reflects the very ugly side of society, the rich just keep getting richer and the poor, well you guessed it get poorer. It shows the true nature of humans too, showing characters doing any form of immoral acts all in the face of money, greed and protection.\n\nWe get to view the life of Suoh through his eyes of a high school student turned into violent a criminal. After the deaths of his parents, Suoh is left without a home or source of income. All he has is his twin sister, Sara, who he promises to provide for, even if doing so means throwing his life away. Suoh works long, physically-demanding hours, and the two survive off instant food, barely scraping by.\n\nAmid a physical altercation with his boss, Suoh blacks out, waking up to find a corpse laying at his feet. His knuckles bloody, his muscles aching, he realizes that he has just murdered his boss, the person responsible for his continued well-being. But rather than lament the loss of life, all Suoh can think of is how badly he needed the money, and what he’ll do next to get it.\n\nDrawn by the scent of blood, one of Suoh’s coworkers, a young man with criminal connections, offers him a not so legal revenue stream, one encouraging violent behavior and rewarding the capable.\n\nBut his new life is not without trouble. Facing death on a weekly basis is only the beginning; between avoiding police detection, eyewitnesses, Suoh’s new life looks to be the death of him.\n\nWill Suoh manage to survive long enough to keep his promise to his sister? Will he turn tail and escape from this life of crime, finding solace in the company of someone or something else?\n\nAudio and Visual elements\nVisual elements – They are alright for the CGs and character sprites with the use of western art can be found in almost all of the CGs. BUT the backgrounds… There was some backgrounds that has quite obvious inconsistency as they can be viewed at the above showcase the top 2 backgrounds looks bad compared to the third and fourth backgrounds that are showcased. But I have to say I loved the CGs the western art style approach was good I liked it overall it was alright but the backgrounds I wish they could be better.\n\nAudio elements – They music cues in perfectly in time with the situation. Overall the music in game is average there is nothing too fancy going on with the music its just average at best.\n\nTo sum up\nI do recommend this Visual Novel but to a certain and why? I recommend this visual novel to a certain extent because firstly and provably 1 of the biggest reason on my list is that I always look out for a consistent art style in backgrounds, sprites and CGs 2 of them are good, [CGs and sprites] but the backgrounds those that are deemed as not up to “standard” are honestly putting me off, meanwhile with very average music its very hard to put this into a good spotlight. On the other hand I do recommend this Visual Novel to people who do like visual novels [obviously] and for people who do like crimes and drugs and many more sensitive topics.\n\nClick here for a review with images, text will be the same but images to help make things clearer[azusantiara.wordpress.com]","January 21","true","6.0"," 46 of 51 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","46","51","3","0"

To me, the macabre events put this on par with popular horror VNs like Saya no Uta. I haven't completed the game yet, but I think I have a pretty firm grasp of the storyline so far.  The grim tale told throughout involves despicable, inhumane acts that made even me feel a bit shocked.The game throws all of these things at you without any warning or mercy. It all holds a touch of realism, however, which makes it all the scarier.  Many of the characters are immoral, none more so than the protagonist himself.\n\nNone of the characters are infallible, and that is shown quite early on. Death is often meaningless and quick as a flash, often without warning. This all adds to the grim reality that the story paints. Crime often goes on without any repercussions, and the rich can get away with just about anything they want. Meanwhile, the protagonist and his sister go through a series of life changing events and by the time the story starts, the protag is desperate to keep his sister from living a life of poverty and cruelty. The stress eventually gets to him and his boss is the one to finally drive him off the deep end. As the story unfolds, it follows the MC's descent into madness and a life of inescapable crime.\n\nThe art is alright, but the character designs leave something to be desired, considering many of the men look like girls, one of whom is the crime lord the protag works under. Other than that, its passable and does not take away from the story. The writing is pretty good so far, and I have not experienced any typos whatsoever. Sometimes the writing seems a bit amateurish though. Some of the sentences suffer from awkward wording, but its probably just a nitpick.\n\nThe game does have one problem that I just can't get around, even if it is just my personal opinion. At first, the protagonist seems to have some moral values, but he eventually just throws that out the window, completely contradicting most of his earlier actions. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but for me it was a major dealbreaker. It made me hate the protagonist beyond belief because his actions seem nonsensical and ridiculous. I could attribute it to his loss of sanity, but as far as I know, its completely unavoidable. To me, it seems out of character and made me lose any type of sympathy for him.\n\nEither way I say pick this one up. The writing and story definitely make up for the unlikeable protagonist. The story is very gripping and holds quite a bit of tension at some points. I can say with absolute certainty that this visual novel is worth the price for me and makes for a nice break from all the Slice Of Life visual novels that have been coming out lately.","January 20","true","8.5"," 38 of 43 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","38","43","2","5"

Evil people aren't evil just for the sake of being evil - though sometimes thier motivations make you cringe, they are still believable.\n\nAnd that's actually the one thing I could mention as a con for some people. This game has some dark elements to it which is to be expected if you read the description but many characters in here including the main character have traits you will not like. I think it makes the story better, but you may feel it is simply too dark.\n\nThere is some good replayiblity here. I think I got the best ending but there are plenty of scenes I have yet to unlock, so I know there is a lot I am missing.\n\nThis isn't a scary game - it's a psychologically dark one.","January 23","true","6.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I noticed a review on Steam comparing this title to Song of Saya (Saya no Uta) and felt it was important to comment that this game is far tamer – I actually enjoyed the ride in Sickness and did not have a constant feeling of dread and disgust that lingered during my Saya playthrough. There are many “nice/calm” moments in Sickness, while none really exist in Saya.\n\nIf you like well-written visual novels with a good storyline and being an assassin, then you will enjoy Sickness. An important note – this game has a lot of writing and requires a great amount of reading, so if you like simple, short VNs this may not be for you.\n\nThe aesthetics are very good – the amount of detail in each scene is high and the artstyle is clean. Be advised, this is not an eroge game, so there are no hentai scenes. There are, however, a few gory instances (but nowhere as bad as Saya). The music and sounds are decent and add to the atmosphere of the story – there is no voice acting, unfortunately. The story is interesting and well-written with quite a bit of content – ~5 hours at least if you are reading every dialogue piece. You have a “sickness” that gives you psychotic, serial killer urges, and you must support your sister because the two of you have been orphaned.\n\nControls are typical of a visual novel game – you will mainly be clicking with your mouse, but you can use the keyboard if you wish. There are fast forward and skip options if you do not want to (or already have) read the dialogue. There isn’t really a difficulty or learning curve because the game plays more as a novel, however, you can die. Save often, as is the golden rule of any visual novel.\n\nGameplay involves you reading a lot of text for most of the game, with decisions during different points – fortunately, in Sickness your choices actually affect the gameplay to a noticeable degree. Again, save often if you like checking what the alternative options will result in. You can rewind through scenes with the mouse wheel, however, it will only go back so far, and you won’t always be able to use this feature to revert your decisions (save/load your game instead). There are plenty of save slots, so take advantage of this.\n\nCompared to many high-quality VNs (both with and without eroge elements), there are a lot of decisions to make in this game, and the choice rubric for determining which ending you get is fairly complex. I really appreciated and enjoyed the quality of the story, choices, and endings – one actually made me very emotional. A very interesting theme surrounding incest can be explored, and the way it is approached in this game does not feel too ridiculous or forced – it may even make you think about the concept differently. Questioning reality and the morality (or immorality) of being an assassin is also a hot topic in Sickness. The character progression is fleshed out well, with the main character’s slow transformation from  someone caught in a bad spot to one who can kill without remorse.\n\nOverall, I would definitely suggest Sickness as a top-quality VN, and to check it out if you want something lighter than Song of Saya (you should probably stay away from Saya unless you have a high tolerance for depravity like me). If you like good stories with compelling themes surrounding the ambiguity of violence, then you will really like the ride found in Sickness.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n\nMy Website[theroguereviews.com]","March 10","true","4.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Seriously. Be warned.\n\nThat is, until you wanna get absoluetly bored to death.\n\nOkay, to be fair, its a visual novel - so its supposed, to contain no gameplay at all, I guess?! But has it to be that paralizing and utter boring? Coffee will be your choice - if you still wanna get this "game".\n\nIts made with RenPy.\nThe presentation is so uber boring lame - you need tons of coffee, to stay awake, and read yourself through tons of non-sensical text - on a level like silly soups in free TV (Charlie Sheen and those crappy guys)- Thats right, they dont stop ever - and its far too much text - you get tired and weaken out, of reading for hours. Not only that, the content of the texts are also verys dumb and silly.\n\nThere is a dialogue skip option - but it doesnt work every now and then - who knows why - and who gives a damn?!\nThere isnt a single spoken word - and you hear the same tune (like Addams Family on the NES) almost the whole "game"\nI guess, there are about 5 music tracks in it, or less? Or you dont even notice, because its all so utter paralizing and sluggish and boring?\n\nThe game switches mostly, between a silly telenovela and the thoughts of a perverted sick child.\nThere is no in-between. Its just the lamest and dumbest "game" I ever played. And I played Postal III or Superman on the N64 (okay - that was hard :) Balloon Fight is a masterpiece compared to this game - Balloon Fight, is considered, to be one of the lamer NES games.\n\nThe story - is just something of the dumbest stories, I have encountered in video games. Really. What a huge laugh.\nWho did come up with this pile of horse ♥♥♥♥♥? Did they hire a deranged child from a mental asylum?\n\nThe game includes those very "mature" themes - but its so silly and unreal - one with a proper human mind will have a mighty huge laugh - about this immature, childish, juvenile story.\n\nYou are this 17 year old teen, that lives with his sister in a huge house (lol - with no jobs at all) - and he is killing and killing without any regret or anything - just cold as plain steel. And this teen, kills even adults in their own houses - sneaking in etc - without planning - sometimes even with gloves - not even wearing something to cover up his hair etc -\nbut the police wont get him - they kinda blend this part of the real world totally out. Like there is no regret.\nLike there is no trace ever made - by a 17 year old - that cant think rational. Now, is this not a hell of a damn good story?\n\nYou wont get punished for your crimes. Only a child or a totally imbecil would think that way.\nAnd the player is not murdering a person per month.......NO....its like, 9 persons in 6 weeks. Without covering up his traces ever - and he gets through with it......just lol.........\n\nNot even Ingmar Bergman would have come up with any better story!\n\nI think Uwe Boll comes up, with a better story (that is really harsh to say :)\n\nJust very unreal and unmature - only the phantasies of a sick teenager would come up with such a laughable story.\n\nPlenty of shocking topics - it almost seem, they tend to shock the audience (you cant say player - because there is not a single minute in the game, where you actually DO PLAY) - with this sickening gory brutal details -that happen all the time.\n\nThe story is so sick and disgusting - the one who came up with this - should seek help from a psychiatrist very urgent!!!\nReally, my advice. I mean it. Seek help, there are plenty of good soul plumbers out there.\n\nI cant take this game seriously. Its just too silly and dumb.\n\nThere is no doubt, the story cant be written by a adult - no way!!! Never!!!\n\nDont buy this game. Seriously. Its just not worth any dough.

Already when I got to know about the project when it still was a wip, I wanted to play it, because it appeared to be quite something special... So I bought it and well... I can highly recommend it. 'Sickness' is all in all a very good game that offers you an enjoyable time, high quality art and a really intriguing story with different characters.\n\nIt was well-written and the music as well as the soundeffects complimented the whole setting. The makers really knew their stuff, let me tell you. The characters were very different and likeable except for Sara actually, which I found to be really annoying and exhausting from time to time. I just didn't warm up with her. I mean, I clearly understand her importance to the story. Nevertheless she meant a constant bother to me. Partly this could be because of her weird relationship to her brother (and that's all I'm going to say about that, since I don't want to spoil it).\nAs other reviewers already mentioned the story was dark. But don't back off just because of that. I'm easily scared but I thought it still was alright. The story is so good that it is worth reading.\n\nThe art is - as mentioned - high quality. Even so I found it to be a little generic. That isn't a style I could recognize out of many artists. This didn't have a real impact on my overall experience, I just thought it was worth mentioning.\n\nWell that's about it. If you buy the game, I hope you'll enjoy playing it as much as I did.","April 3","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's of the VN genre, thought expect more brutal violence than the typical romance VN's are known for. It explores several dark themes throughout the story and should typically take someone around 2 hours to complete. I opened this game this morning and found myself unable to stop until I saw every ending, unlocking 100% achievement progress on the way.\n\nJust be aware that this VN is dark, sometimes depressing, and borderline offensive at times. If you are not bothered by any of those things then I would hazard that you will enjoy this. For ages 18+","February 21","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I definitely recommend playing this amazing visual novel. I enjoyed the visual novel more than I thought I would.\n\nU Play the main character named Suoh who is trying to make money and support his sister at the same time. Both of their parents died in a accident and could not inherant the money or house right away. Follow Suoh in his very dark adventures in this visual novel sickness while he tries to make money again for both him and his sister. Money drives people to do very crazy things>_<\n\nSince this game is called sickness this visual novel is not a light hearted one at all. It's a very bloody, dark, murder is involved, and messes with your head. If you don't like dark or violent visual novels then stay away from this visual novel.\n\nI really liked the character's in this visual novel. Suoh is the one that changed for not the better. It's interesting because I felt some sympathy for Suoh at times. I won't say anymire to not spoil anything. If you do play this vn then you might agree as ti why I feel some sympathy for Suoh.\n\nThere was a character in the game that was down right my favorite and his name was Karasu. OMG he was super funny which was great since this game has to many dark themes in it. Karasu helped lightened the mood.\n\nMy other favorite charater was Misa. She is super cute and awesome:)\n\nThe CG, BG, and music was really good. You have 12 pages of images to unlock. That's nice because 12 pages of images is quite a lot in my opinion.\n\nThe music was just too good in my opinion.\n\nSo all in all if you can your in the mood to play not light hearted VN I recommend this VN 100%. You won't regret buying this amazing VN.\n\nUpdate May 30th,2016\n\nI noticed that last week this game got an update and I saw that in the update u play in Misa's POV. To play Misa's POV u have to finish her route first. U don't have to finish the whole game.\n\nAs said before Misa is my second favorite character and I really enjoyed play Misa's side of the story.\n\nI hope that an extra side of Sara is made because I would love to play a Sara POV how she takes all of what Suoh is up too.","March 17","true","28.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
