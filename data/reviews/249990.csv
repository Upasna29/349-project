It's miserable.\n\nThat said, I absolutely recommend this game for co-op with 3 or 4 players.  This game is a very tough gauntlet-style game, with puzzley elements frequently thrown in.  Yes, you are smacking monsters and trying to stay alive, while doing puzzles at the same time.  It's freaking hard.\n\nBut, it is very satisfying to complete the levels.\n\nThe only downside is that the netcode still isn't rock solid.  For whatever reason, I have a 20%ish game freeze rate when trying to start a group game, requiring me to totally shut down the game and restart.  Other than that, it seems ok.","October 13, 2014","true","7.1"," 230 of 246 people (93%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","93","230","246","9","1"

It can be compared to games like Diablo, but it's not another Diablo clone - there's no loot in this game and its more co-op than any Diablo-like games I played.\n\nIn this game you play as slave gladiator who is forced to fight to amuse god-like creatures. Thus this game is based around Trials - rather small arena-like challenges. They can vary from "kill everyone" kind of thing to puzzles, mazes and boss battles.\n\nYou have 4 classes(or to be more precise - 4 weapons) - Volcanic Hammer(AoE melee damage), Frost Shield(Tank), Spirit Blades(Single target melee damage), Storm Bow(Ranged damage) (Each of them have skills to heal each other). In each trial you can get a maximum of 3 crystals (1 for the completion of the trial, 1 for challenge(these will vary from trial to trial) and 1 for time attack). These crystals will unlock new skills(you have a total of 8 active and 8 passive skills for each weapon with only 6 slots(3 for active and 3 for passive)). Also note that your progress is shared among all weapons, so you will get all skills for all weapons simultaneously,\n\nAnother thing is Spirit Mentor(named Balfus) who is one of the key features of the game. Balfus is your way of interacting with environment and is vital to every trial. To spice things up, you can't just order him to go somewhere. Instead, you can only call him on your current position, which makes everything a bit harder.\n\nAnd about the difficulty - this game is hard. Like, really hard. Not once have I found myself stuck and not once did I go back to gather some more crystals.\n\nAs a closing note - this game is heavily co-op oriented and I don't know how good it plays in single player. So it will be better if you have some friends to play with.\n\nAs a downside of this game I can say about quite unstable net code, but devs are constantly working on it.\n\n","November 25, 2013","true","14.4"," 226 of 268 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","226","268","0","19"

Extremely difficult, we've spent over an hour on certain trials (still not done with all of them), especially difficult if you want to do the challenges. Controls work great on a controller, gameplay is overall interesting. The orb idea is a neat one, makes for fun and interesting puzzles, although you might kill your friends over it at certain times. You WILL have to go back and revisit previous levels to do the challenges, which provide the upgrade gems for abilities. I personally like this, challenges are usually fun and they really need teamwork, but I imagine it may bother some people playing the same levels over and over.\n\nPlays best if you have friends over, you really need to communicate (yell, actually). The main reason why you really need friends for this. Everyone should have a mic and lots of patience, really difficult to have this with strangers.\n\nGot a 4 pack in sale a while back, money well spent.

I've had more fun with this playing with friends than any other game.  No other game has permitted me to talk at such loud levels to the people sitting next to me.\n\nIt's a lot like gauntlent but a greater challenge in my opinion.  Where as gauntlent is more geared toward grinding mobs down, this is more for how well can you work together on a particular goal.  I haven't encountered many games that make you have to be this tightly coordinated.  Weak links will become apparent and quick.  Each level brings a new way of having to making a plan.  Each monster has to be learned how to be dealt with.  Kiting isn't an option.  Understanding how each fighter operates is vital.\n\nMy warnings:  This is meant for co-op.  You can play single player, but you aren't going to have as much fun.  More importantly, you will want to find a consistant person or so to play with, which I know isn't always easy.  Pugging this game usually ends in a bad result, and there aren't enough people in the lobby to make games happen when you have time to play.  Also, I would not say this is for a casual gamer.  If you haven't built up a reasonable degree of twitch, I feel you are just going to get frustrated.  I'm not saying people can't learn, but I've seen people that don't play a lot of games say this is not for them.\n\nGames are fun, but to me this one was an experience.  One I could share with some good friends.","September 30, 2015","true","87.9"," 77 of 84 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","77","84","3","0"

It's a very quick and short tale that leaves a lot to the imagination. I'm not saying it's bad; simply shallow. If  your goal is to find a rich story - you will not find it here.\n\nELEMENTS\nAll players have the option to play one of four classes which are determined in the entrance room to each trial room. It is also good to note that no matter the decision of the class; in most cases you will have healing spells, damage spells, and defensive spells of some kind. Other than the inherit differences between melee and ranged; the developers have done a good job at keeping most everything balanced. The true co-op experience comes into play before anyone even enters a trial; deciding who will have which spell to counter the trial mechanics. This is an element that most co-op games don't have.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nOnce your skills and class has been chosen - per challenge - you will face 25 trials with increasing difficulty. As one may expect the game starts out in a tutorial manner, teaching players how to navigate the trial and use new mechanics. Balfus (your spirit guide) is an integral part of the gameplay, requiring players to move him to destroy shrines or statues, light the path, assist in damage dealing, or in some trials - used against you!The primary game play is to complete objectives which range from killing monsters, finding the end of a maze, or simply lighting shrines. As a side note I wouldn't say this is necessarily a game with heavy puzzle elements; however there is a degree of puzzle solving.\n\nDIFFICULTY\nIf you plan on being a completionist, to get all 75 crystals and all achievements, expect to spend some time on this game. At the time of this writing I have completed all achievements in roughly 24 hours of gameplay. Most challenges took my team 1-10 tries; the challenge on the last boss took us roughly 4 hours. If you plan on simply completing the trials to have the experience to play - expect at best half of that. I would not recommend this game if you want to just play single player - this is a game best experienced with friends. Disclaimer: Your mileage my vary, every gamer and team is different you could see significantly less or more gameplay.\n\nTECHNICAL\nI have to peck at the game a bit on this level; there are still a few issues with networking that the developers are actively working on. In addition the game is poorly optimized in terms of graphics use. A lot of the options to effectively reduce load on a computers GPU is non-existant. My system with a GTX570 runs this game fine, but quite hot in comparison to other games with a much higher expectation (100% load in some areas running 70c+). I assume as the game matures further, the developers will continue solving some of the technical issues that some players are reporting as problems; they did not effect my team as much as some but it is important to note that they could come up.\n\nCONCLUSION\nHighly recommended for any CO-OP experience. This game is quite fun with a lot of potential for growth in the future. 9/10 for what it is, and for my experience.","December 30, 2013","true","25.7"," 123 of 151 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","123","151","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_holysword/recommended/249990/","the_holysword","Holysword","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_holysword/","236 products in account","IMPORTANT NOTICE: This is not really an RPG game in most of its sense; there is no actual character sheet, and when your character evolves, whatever choice you make in that regard can be undone freely. Changing your build is literally like changing clothes. There is no looting or potions. There is no choice of gear other than the 4 basic sets, which are also your "class", and once again, you can freely swap. This is nothing like Diablo (in this sense) unlike other reviewers insist to claim. Bear that in mind.\n\nDevilishly challenging yet fair, this here is a masterpiece.\n\nYou are simply FORCED to undergo challenges in a twisted sort of arena. Endlessly spawning monsters chasing you while you try to solve a maze, or while you run away from a deadly red myst, or perhaps while you try to take cover from a laser beams (lol what?! its magic!)... figuring out how to solve each area is one thing, solving it is ANOTHER THING!\n\nCompletion of each area is required to access its respective boss, and each completion awards you with one crystal - literally one "experience point" - that unlock skills. Optionally you can solve an area while doing a special challenge (depends on the area) or while time-attacking, each of which award you another crystal. Whereas you might think "Nah, I'm not an achievement hunter, I just wanna finish the game" you might be FORCED (unexpected pun) to change your mind there as sometimes the higher level skills give you a crucial advantage when fighting the boss.\n\nThere is no difficulty tweak, you cannot switch to "easy mode". Definitely not for people who get frustrated easily.","November 27, 2014","true","53.3"," 94 of 113 people (83%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","83","94","113","15","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/midnightwolfie/recommended/249990/","midnightwolfie","MidnightWolfie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/midnightwolfie/","597 products in account","A bit about the game and developers.\nFORCED has been developed and published by a small group of Danish developers, called BetaDwarf Studio. They actually had a pretty funny story while making this game. In fact, it was so funny that they even made a picture about it which you can see here.\n\nSo, FORCED is a Co-Op adventure game with a lot of puzzle elements. The game does future single player, but I do not recommend that.. More about that in the Gameplay section of the review! They also plan to bring this game to Wii-U!\n\nAbout Gameplay.\nAs I said above, Forced is a game that allows both single player and co-op. At begining I was playing this game single player. My steam friend list has a couple of people who own this game, but nobody played at the time when I did. So anyway, In single player the game is quite fun! The story is very good too. It wasn't so hard, and I really enjoyed it. But then, couple of missions later... It became quite hard! So, I got into the game once at the same time as my friend FaithNoMore did. We decided to try the game out in Co-op..\n\nIt was amazing! The game became much easier but it kept being harder and harder as we progressed through the challenges. In most of the cases one of us was always the last-man-standing, running around the enemies, doing his best to stay alive long enough for the other person to revive. We also found out that this game is actually meant to be played in four people! After a while, our obstacles became quite hard. So hard that one of us had to keep sacrificing just so we could complete a mission. If there were four of us, it would be piece of cake!\n\nThe game has four different classes, a rogue, archer, tank and a "area of damage" damage dealer. Each of them has their own element. Rogue uses poison and has teleportation skills and skills that get him out of combat quite fast. He's the best class to take creatures down one by one. Archer uses lightning element with which he deals nice damage to couple of creatures at the same time. His arrows also always push enemies back, so he doesn't have too big problem with staying alive. Tank uses ice element to make ice crystal around him which then pushes enemies back, and so on and on. Needless to say he's got the biggest hp. He also has a weapon (shield) which can be thrown away to enemies. Now, the AoE damage dealer uses fire element to deal very big damage to multiple creatures at the same time. Sounds overpowered, right? Well, he does deal big damage, but he swings very slowly. He can also crush a meteorite down onto the enemies.\n\nThis game also has a lot of different creatures that you have to fight against to win. All of them have their own strength and weaknesses. Some spit on you from far, some charge you with their massive cleaves. And once again, you need a full group of four to make a great tactic on how to win against the creatures.\n\nGraphic and Audio\nGraphically speaking the game looks very good! The game itself looks a bit cartoonish. The skill effects look quite nice. For an Indie company they really put their backs into it! Voice acting in the game is very good too!\n\nPros, cons and final grade.\nPros:\n- Very cheap!\n- Extremely fun!\n- Supports four players at the same time!\n- Full of puzzles!\n- It's an extremely fun, cheap coop puzzle based indie game!\n\nCons:\n- Almost unplayable in single player.\n\nFinal grade: 9/10 !\n\nExtra info: If you're into puzzles and you're searching for something to play with your friends, this game is for you! Don't look anywhere further, just buy this game and play it. It's amazing!\n\n\nThank you for reading my reviews!

You play as a slave being trained up to be a gladiator and you are exposed to 25 challenging levels (5 bosses, 20 challenge rooms). After 30 hours of playing the game (it can definitely be completed MUCH faster), here's what I think..\n\nPros:\n\n- The game is infinitely more fun with co-op partners. The difficulty fluctuates a lot depending on whether you do a challenge solo or with a group. For example, some challenge rooms are easier to do with more people. On the other hand, some boss rooms require a lot more concentration with a full group due to the higher amount of adds. Either way it is a game that does a great job of promoting teamwork seeing as the 4 available weapon-types have a specific role to fulfill.\n\n- The skill variety is ample enough. There are 3 passive and active slots and there are enough skills for all types of situations.\n\n- There is a large variety of different challenges rooms with various objectives. There are 4 acts (or areas) and all of the puzzles are different. No 2 puzzles repeat so you can be sure that the game stays 'fresh' until the end.\n\n- You get to face challenging bosses. Each boss has a speed challenge and a 'self-imposed' handicap challenge. With these 2 challenges, you can't just face-smash your way to full-on victory. Fully completing a boss level requires a certain level of precision and understanding of the room's mechanisms.\n\n- The spirit guide's dialogue is quite well-done. It was entertaining enough to get me through the entire game without getting complacent.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- The Camera feels very limited.\n- There is currently a glitch that sinks the 3rd player in any group under the floor when entering or re-entering the preparation room. They are currently looking into it.\n- High latency can cause issues in some puzzles. These issues can block progression.\n\nAll in all I loved FORCED. I haven't had that much fun in co-op since playing Magicka.\n\nI would like to see more puzzles in the future. The bosses were alright but the puzzles felt a lot more satisfying/rewarding when completed.\n\n9/10 and looking forward to sequels and other releases from this developer!","January 28, 2014","true","32.8"," 85 of 110 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","85","110","0","0"

Great game for the casuals AND the hardcore gamers. It's a challenge even if you don't look to complete all the achievement ( I did...I got hooked...It's awesome ^^ ). You never stop improving and if you're up to the challenge, you're going to have loads of fun.\n\nThe adventure is great, with a steady learning curve. You get to learn how to play each of these four badasses if you feel like it or you can just go and solo one of them if you have a favourite, it's not impossible to finish the game if you do.\n\nBosses are sometimes a bit easy because the strats are quite simple to understand BUT most of them are still challenging because in this game, knowing what to do is the easy part, being able to do it is a whole other story.\n\nIf you have a trustworthy group of friends though, buy the fourpack, and solve these levels together. The more the merrier. Really. Especially since some of these levels take you by surprise : there's nothing funnier than seeing your friends panic and getting slaughtered in every side of the map because of some new content to the game ^^ (Beware of the fog !).\n\nFinally, the new mode they added, survival mode, is a gem. The first levels are a bit easy to beat imo, compared to the rest of the game, but the last one is....evil. I can't imagine playing with 4 players in this last level, but I'm guessing it must be the funniest experience this game has to offer. You'll understand once you get there ^^\nAlso, there is a 'last man standing' level in these survival maps which seems pretty interesting and very promising in a way that I'll surely spend nights with my friends playing this level only and having fun helping/betraying your friends to survive the longest time possible =D.\n\nOverall an incredible game for those who like puzzles, badass characters with skill trees and passive trees, and last but not least, a little bit of challenge, for a price that is, in my opinion way underappreciated.","October 19, 2015","true","24.5"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","3"

It's not that much about puzzles or real combat skills (I imagined something like dodging at the right time, using different attacks per enemy weaknesses, combo-ing, etc). No, it's more about great cooperation between players (voice chat is an absolute must), selecting correct skills from the skill tree for that particular level, and, unfortunately, also about grinding. The game is quite hard, don't expect a casual multiplayer co-op game. You'll need to repeat every level many times to at least finish it. And then, you'll need to repeat it many times more in order to fulfill the challenge or time criteria. If you don't do it, you'll be very much underpowered in the later levels and the difficulty will go from high to insane.\n\nSo, the principle of the game is not to enjoy many different levels. The number or levels is quite low (25). The principle of the game is to rinse and repeat until you finish them perfectly. It's not what I expected and it's not what I enjoy, but tastes differ, I'm sure many people will like it. That's not why I'm giving it a thumbs down.\n\nThe thumbs down goes for technical execution. From technical level, this game is horrible. Network issues are extremely common - the game splits and people see different things on their screens, someone can't move at all, someone dies but gets stuck in the dying animation and glitches the level, unable to complete it, and the list goes on. But, that's not the worst thing. The worst thing is the camera. It deserves a paragraph on its own.\n\nThe camera. The devs had an idea that you need to see all characters at the same time, all the time. So if you go into different directions, the camera zooms out to make sure you see all characters. Questionably a good idea, with the worst implementation ever. First, this camera mode is mandatory, you can't switch between "focused camera" (seeing just yourself in the center of the screen) and "overview camera" (seeing everyone). No, it's just the overview camera. So, if you go far apart (necessary in some levels), you're zoomed out immensely, and your characters (and enemies) are very small. Try to use your skills effectively then! You're also in a corner or near the edge of the screen, so you have no idea what's near you in certain directions. The camera constantly shifts (as others move around), which throws your aim out of balance (especially frustration when playing the archer character). And to top all of that, the devs even botched it so much, that very often the camera actually crops your character and you're behind the edge or the corner of the screen! So, you don't actually see yourself, or the enemies around you, and you're expected to fight them and survive. Please don't forget this game is extremely punishing for even the smallest errors. You'll cry, you'll shout, you'll tear things apart. That's how bad the camera is.\n\nOne final note, this game has to be played with a stable group of friends. No one might be missing any time. The reason is that every time you start a game, you'll only receive those gems, which have been completed by *all* members of the party. So if one of your friends was not available last time, you'll need to repeat all levels with him/her again, and complete all of it again. This was not the best design choice, and again, you have no option to configure this, you need to live with it. Consider it, if you don't have a stable group of friends to play and finish this game with.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the game mechanics are not necessarily bad, they can be even enjoyable. But the technical execution is definitely a reason to avoid this game. And that's 18 months after release, so there's no hope of having it improved, ever.","January 27, 2015","false","14.7"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","22","30","0","1"

This game is very heavy on Time Trials and alot of replays on missions. I don't see how a single player can do it with out spending alot of time redoing the missions or watch a youtube video on tme. We play about 10 missions and we completed in 5 mins or less per mission. Some of the time trials wanted you to complete the mission in a min or less. I purchase this for my brother and me and with two players using TeamSpeaker we had a hard time and it was not enjoyable.\n\nGame play was more like,move the orb around, light this stuff with the orb, blow this up with the orb, kill this device with the orb, then a hack and slash game with puzzles. We forgot all about the mobs and was just trying to get the mission done in time. I feel like the mobs of bad guys was just an annoyance and didn't help the game play. When you goal is trying to solve a puzzle in time, to get the crystals, to get new powers.\n\nI would not recommend this game, unless you like replaying the same lvl over and over and over to get the pattern down on using the orb at the right time to get all the crystals.  Also the game "About the Game" is so short, i believe because they was afraid if they gave you too much info you would not play the game.

I have not tried single player. That said, the game was quite fun with one other person and requires a signifcant amount of teamwork to complete challenges and to fight bosses.\n\nFORCED is an interesting take on the action rpg genre. Instead of running around solely fighting hordes of monsters, you have arenas that you must enter and complete challenges. You also have an NPC that you must guide around who is an integral part of completing these challenges, which usually involves calling him to particular locations, causing him to move over shrines or other objectives to complete objectives while monsters are there to get in the way and make things more difficult. I wouldn't go so far as to call these challenges puzzles, as it is usually pretty obvious what needs to be done and is more a matter of execution.\n\nThere are a panoply of abilities you can unlock to help you destroy monsters. They are unlocked by completing arenas, completing them quickly, and by doing special objectives in them. There are four classes and you are not tied to a particular one. You can change your class any time you are not in an arena and you will have the same tier of abilities unlocked on each character, so you don't have to level each one or anything like that.\n\nThe boss arenas are fun and each one has their own interesting set of mechanics. A few of the arenas and one of the boss fights in particular (the skeleton, for reference) are quite difficult, but that just makes beating them all the more satisfying.\n\nSo all in all, a fun game to play co-op. I'm not sure about the single player aspect of the game. Having had a multiplayer play through, I have no interest in going through a second run solo.","November 2, 2014","true","14.8"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","21","31","0","0"

I think it’s one of the best co-op games I’ve played over the last few years and I really can’t fault it for putting teamwork, experimentation and thoughtful proactive play at the front of the experience. We all initially sort of scoffed at Balfus (the orb) as a bit of a gimmick, but he’s arguably the star of the show, binding players together and really underlining the importance of cooperation.

There are no difficulty settings and the "RPG" elements don't really afford you much benefit, at lease in the sense that in most RPGs you can grind/build up in reponse to a challenge you can't yet overcome.\n\nFORCED gives you no such luxury or mercy.\n\nAs a result, unless you consider yourself a hardcore gamer, you'll likely find yourself frustrated with the game mechanics in subsequent acts past the first one.  There is no end-around or alternative strategy that will ease the challenge for the sake of completing the game.  Instead, there are brick walls.  You must find a way to climb them.  The game will offer you no quarter, even with friends.\n\nUltimately a shame, because the co-op build and design is really enjoyable.\n\nThe diffuclty level, for me at least, was a very unfortunate and very disappointing dealbreaker.","May 8, 2015","false","5.5"," 69 of 125 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","69","125","4","4"

Unlike other ARPGs or whatever we call these it's not focused around finding gear and leveling up. Instead each stage has a mission, a purpose. These are simple puzzles or annoying challenges that you need to find a plan on how to solve. It could be lasers, or bombs or just a simple "kill everything mission". After a mission you are returned to a "world map" inbetween missions. You may change between 4 classes and 2 people can't be the same class. The classes act a little different and are good for different things.\nIn each mission you can earn 3 crystals, which is basically the leveling up system of the game. Once you reach a certain number of crystals you unlock additional skills you can use instead of the basic ones. How do you earn the crystals? It's a little different depending on the mission but mostly it's about clearing the mission within a certain time frame, not taking damage or doing something fancy.\n\nGreat game, but play with some friends.","December 13, 2015","true","8.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

He has a mental disorder, so he's got multiple personalities and one of them is a capital arsehat. that's why you have to be a gladiator.\nOnce they establish the plot, you get to punch a scarecrow with a weapon and then you get to punch it REALLY hard and then you're a real gladiator. This is a good game to play with a controller. After you're a real gladiator, you have to go fight real enemies, and then you're a true gladiator. Once you do that, you can start playing actual levels, and then you can be acknowledged as a gladiator.\nLevels are fun with friends, if you happen to have any. Friends are useful because they do everything wrong and will inevitably make the game harder. So don't try to play this with friends, they're usually really bad at this. If you do play with friends out of the kindness of your heart, it is not required that you acknowledge them as gladiators. You may opt to refer to them as peasent, commoner, or perhaps dead.\n\nFighting is fun because you pick a weapon and then you kill enemies with it. When you kill an enemy a few times, it loses health and gains marks instead. Marks are sort of like a currency in this game, where enemies can trade you their health points for more marks. Once they've made this trade, they can opt  to sell them to you in exchange for more damage. Through this method, you can kill enemies, and become a gladiator.\n\nBecoming a gladiator is harder than just killing enemies though. you need to get crystals and stuff, and those let you get more abilities and passive things and active abilities and passive abilities, as well as skills which you acquire by collecting gems.\nThere is also a soundtrack in the game, although I do not remember any of it. It is probably gladiator music. I can not confirm this. I would give this game anywhere from 10 to 12 dollars, because I think it was on sale.\nNow is a good time to buy it, since you can get it at full price again.\n\nThis is a definite must-have for anyone that thinks they might like to be a gladiator, in any sense of the word.","October 23, 2013","true","6.5"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Moist Panties","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/","260 products in account","Typically single player games have co-op features that aren't requirements to play and pass the game. FORCED on the other hand is a single player game that HAS TO BE played in co-op. The challenges scale so that if there are fewer players you may need to do a task fewer times or kill fewer enemies, but it's still challenges created with co-operative play in mind; you may need to carry a ball fewer times across the screen but you still need to carry it across the screen rather than alternating with a partner. There are four heroes, each specializing in different tasks and the game comes into its own when they're all working together taking advantage of their specialties. You can conceivably play this title single player but it's an experience meant for co-op. Preferably 3 people or more (max of 4).\n\nLike any co-op experience FORCED spends little time in cutscenes or dialogue; there are 5 hubworlds you travel to in a small overworld map, each with 5 levels and a boss. Each level gives you a max of three crystals: one for completion, another for completing a challenge specific to that level, and a third for completion under a certain time.\n\nIt's a relatively short game if you're just aiming to pass levels and face the bosses. Despite that several levels and bosses present a WORTHY challenge and will require some coordination and strategizing on your teams' end. Otherwise length and replay value comes in trying to do the challenges and finishing the levels under the time limit. Many of the challenges further the co-op aspect by requiring some modicum of strategy in finishing them, whether that be lining up the shield hero so that he tanks hits whilst the archer attacks from afar so that no one on the team is hit by a particular enemy, or positioning heroes so that an explosive object doesnt touch enemies on its way to its objective in a timely manner. I don't know how its even possible to complete some of these tasks in single player.\n\nThe point in completing challenges is for crystals; attaining a certain amount unlocks more abilities for your class and/or slots to use abilities (maximum of three). The abilities are obviously different for each class, and they have their use depending on what you're trying to do. You can use one of your slots for a healing ability to aid your team in bossfights, or you can switch it out for a rapid fire attack to take out many smaller enemies that may present issues whilst the rest of your team is focusing a large enemy down. Pre-levels there's a moderate amount of strategy in synergizing heroes and abilities to get the job done.\n\nGood and pretty short co-op experience, but that's the big thing: unless you have a group of people to play this with don't bother. It can be fun playing alone, but it's like playing payday or left4dead alone and without bots. It's made to be a co-op title and without it it isn't as enjoyable.","May 5","true","10.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

FORCED has some issues, but it's well worth your time to play, especially if you can play with friends.\n\nUpon starting FORCED, I faced some serious problems trying to get controllers working. Supposedly these issues have all been fixed now, so hopefully you won't suffer the same hassles.  Even if you do, however, I recommend you perservere and get it set up to play.\n\nFORCED is first and foremost a puzzle game. Yes, the combat plays a significant part, and you will get good at the combat (and will need to), but the puzzles and the teamplay is what makes the game.  Trying to work out how to complete levels, and then complete the challenges and time trials is genuinely fun and will make you think and strategise, which is a really refreshing change of pace from so many other games.\n\nPerhaps the biggest issues are the occasional bug that can make a level impossible, the aforementioned controller issues, and the skill unlock progression.  Some of the high levels skills unlocked later in the game are *really* underwhelming given the effort you've gone to acquire them, and the last unlock requires you to complete everything in order to obtain. That's right, you have to do everything in the game in order to unlock the last abilities, and even if they weren't hideously disappointing (which they are), that would leave you with nothing to do with that ability.\n\nWhile FORCED enjoyable solo, I would most heartily recommend it as a fantastic game to play local co-op, I've read reports of issues with the net-code for playing with others online, but playing with multiple people on one screen is great.\n\nI'd really love to see more from FORCED. I'd love to see more levels, and ideally some reworking of some of the skills available - there are a number that are basically useless.

After finishing six of the 25 available levels, I can say that thinking up and implementing strategies for achieving each level's extra goals (finishing it within a given time limit, plus one level-specific goal) is really satisfying.\n\nYou will be running the same levels over and over again, but there's no grind - you will be trying various approaches, or attempt to perfect the execution of a strategy you thought up (it's not the hardest game in the world, nor does it try to be, but it's decently challenging for your average gamer, so that will happen sooner or later).\n\nIt's not the Greatest ♥♥♥♥ing Thing Ever, but it's a splendid game you might spend tens of hours on and thoroughly enjoy it, and it's an excellent co-op experience.

FORCED to fight for your life alone or with friends, with up to 4 player co-op with 4 different classes.\n\nIn this game, you are tying to survive in challenges put on you by gods, made for their own enjoyment. You are helped by this soul to destroy them and free your people once and for all. In ages past, your race is alive only to fight and die for the entertainment of beings much more powerful than you. This will change.\n\nThe four classes available are very different in what they do, being very solid to the class they represent.\nThe first is ranged, using a bow and agility like abilities and based around lightning. Second, a strength based two handed class using fire and heavy but slow attacks. A rogue is the third, using fast attacks with evasion abilities. The last is a frost themed tank with defensive abilities and stuns to reduce the damage everyone in your party takes. You can choose between them whenever you want, in between levels and depending on what is needed.\n\nThe game is a mix of a hack and slash with puzzle elements, really focusing on teamwork when played with others. I found the gameplay boring by myself, but when I played with a friend it was much more enjoyable. It can be very difficult at times, requiring a very good amount of game sense to dodge certain abilities and do certain puzzles. The bosses are very well thought out, giving a nice end to each chapter. They are also very unforgiving.\n\nThe price is pretty high when not on sale, much too high for a game like this (its pretty short, being completed in around 8 hours) and I would recommend only getting it on sale. Make sure you get a friend who kinda knows what a hack and slash is, because its much more fun with another person, but having an inexperienced player makes it much much much more difficult.\n\nOverall, 8 hours of gameplay, hack and slash gameplay with puzzle elements and four classes. Don't buy on full price, wait for a sale.\n\nPersonal Rating: 3/5","January 30","true","10.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It can be played solo (at some points it feels like the challenges are easier solo). This isn't torchlight, though that's what it looks like. You're here to complete levels, sort of like minigames. Each level has 3 components - getting through it (completion), an achievement you have to complete along with the rest of the level (challenge) and a time attack (time). The more of these you complete, the more crystals you get which give you unlocks that you'll need - 1 crystal is basically 1 level for your characters. You can switch out characters on a per level/per retry basis, you're not locked into any one class, which is fantastic.","November 27, 2013","true","35.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The addictiveness of typical RPG's (like leveling up and collecting items) is kind of absent in this game. It's fun having the flexibility to select your skills and character at any time, but the skills are more like "powerups" that you unlock through the game.\n\nOverall, I think it has good depth, but the emphasis on puzzle solving makes it more casual, and not really a game to get hooked on.\n\nIf I had to give it a vague rating, I would say 7/10 and recommended.","December 21, 2013","true","6.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

But seriously this game is tons of fun. It's not exactly story-rich, but thats not really something you look for in this style of game. The four characters to pick from are a good representation of different play styles, and the variety of spells allow for some customization to that as well. The levels are more than just navigating through the map; the puzzles are very challenging at times, and the boss levels are actually tough. To me, those two points determine the success or failure of this style of game, and Forced is a winner in both categories.\n\nPros:\nChallenging puzzles\nTough boss levels\n\nCons:\nThin story (but seriously, who cares about that? That's like complaining that the Dota 2 lore is weak.)\n\nOne more thing: go to BetaDwarf's site, and read about how while programming this game, they literally lived in part of a college that wasn't being used for almost a year before they got caught and kicked out! It's hilarious, and there's no way you won't buy the game after that.

Each class has different unlockable passive and active abilities.  You collect Gems  by completing various tasks within each level and that's how you level up in the game. You play as gladiators (the Storm Bow, the Volcanic Hammer, the Spirit Knives and the Frost Shield) who try to find their freedom and are aided by a spirit called Balfus. Balfus and the fact that you can use him by calling him toward you, lighting torches (and some other things) is the main reason this game stands out as it adds some great and diverse tactics that always serve towards your goal of earning the 3 Gems each level (arena) has to offer. The story is not this game's strong point as the plot is fairly simple. You play as a gladiator that has been FORCED (pun intended) to fight in arenas and Balfus guides you through it and you ultimately have to become a free man.\nAll in all the game is really tactical and has a lot of strategic depth, granted you want to 100% it with friends.\nThe multiplayer is really fun and I recommend you get 3 or 4 friends to play with.

Its claim to fame is that players are supposed to cooperate in puzzle solving while being assaulted by waves of enemies. However, these systems work against each other. The AI enemies are not threatening enough to pose as a threat; they become a mere annoyance as you try to solve the puzzles to finish the level. Likewise, the co-op puzzles aren't very good either; instructions and tutorials are vague, but if you manage to guess-and-check your way to the solution, you'll find many levels that repeat the same type of puzzle. The co-op system doesn't really work with puzzles; you'll be fighting your friends for your idea of problem solving, instead of collaborating to complete the challenge.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/oxin8/recommended/249990/","oxin8","Oxin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/oxin8/","282 products in account","The bugs in this game are impressive. Between the repeating "Space Space Space" and controller support dropping out until a restart, it's kinda hard to tell which one is my favorite. That's a lie. My favorite bug make progression difficult for some people.... So I started playing this with 2 friends and after a few hours, we went to bed having enjoyed the mechanics that make this game challenging. We were eager to get back into it the next night but I had errands to run. So my friends used the game's built in profile system to create a new profile so they could play fresh without me and switch back when I jumped in. Well, that worked fine until they switched back and their crystal count dropped to zero. Thanks to some complaints on the forum, we solved the problem easy and kept playing till we reached the final(?) boss and lost repeatedly.\n\nIn case someone else has the same problem, here's a rough explanation of the easy workaround: First, go the data folders on the affected machines for the game and set them to readonly. Then on the master machine(the guy who didn't swap profiles), use HFS webserver to host the master data folder. Then, simply run the following c# code on the effected machines(might need to changes some variables) before you start the game every time. This way, the master machine keeps progressing in the game and the other machines get a copy of that progression before the game starts. Easy as pie!\n\nC# code(I ran it in Linqpad):\nstring userFolderName = Directory.GetDirectories(@"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\").FirstOrDefault();\nstring mainDir = userFolderName + @"\249990\";\nstring profilePath = mainDir + @"\remote\PROFILE_";\nstring cachedPath = mainDir + @"remotecache.vdf";\nbool readOnly = (new FileInfo(profilePath)).IsReadOnly;\n("ReadOnly:"+readOnly).Dump();\n(new FileInfo(profilePath)).IsReadOnly = false;\n(new FileInfo(cachedPath)).IsReadOnly = false;\nvar profileSplit = File.ReadAllLines(profilePath)[0].Split('*');\nstring steamId = profileSplit[1];\nstring steamName = profileSplit[2];\n(steamId + ":" + steamName).Dump();\n//profileSplit.Dump();\nvar client = new WebClient();\nclient.DownloadFile("http://192.168.0.108/249990/remotecache.vdf",cachedPath+"1");\nclient.DownloadFile("http://192.168.0.108/249990/remote/PROFILE_",profilePath+"1");\nFile.Delete(cachedPath);\nFile.Delete(profilePath);\nFile.Move(cachedPath+"1",cachedPath);\nFile.Move(profilePath+"1",profilePath);\nvar crypt = new System.Security.Cryptography.SHA1CryptoServiceProvider();\nvar allOldBytes = File.ReadAllBytes(profilePath);\nint oldBytesLength = allOldBytes.Length;\nvar oldSha = String.Join("",crypt.ComputeHash(allOldBytes).Select (x => x.ToString("x2")));\n(oldBytesLength + ":" + oldSha).Dump();\nvar newProfileSplit = File.ReadAllLines(profilePath)[0].Split('*');\nstring wrongSteamId = newProfileSplit[1];\nstring wrongSteamName = newProfileSplit[2];\n(wrongSteamId + ":" + wrongSteamName).Dump();\nstring allText = File.ReadAllText(profilePath);\nstring fixedText = allText.Replace(wrongSteamId, steamId).Replace(wrongSteamName, steamName);\nFile.WriteAllText(profilePath, fixedText);\nvar allNewBytes = File.ReadAllBytes(profilePath);\nint newBytesLength = allNewBytes.Length;\nvar newSha = String.Join("",crypt.ComputeHash(allNewBytes).Select (x => x.ToString("x2")));\n(newBytesLength + ":" + newSha).Dump();\nstring allCachedText = File.ReadAllText(cachedPath);\nstring fixedCachedText = allCachedText.Replace("\""+oldBytesLength, "\""+newBytesLength).Replace(oldSha, newSha);\nFile.WriteAllText(cachedPath, fixedCachedText);\n(new FileInfo(profilePath)).IsReadOnly = readOnly;\n(new FileInfo(cachedPath)).IsReadOnly = readOnly;\n\nJokes aside, it's a fun game but if you hit a rough bug, you might end up rage quitting for good.","October 30, 2015","false","36.6"," 23 of 44 people (52%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","52","23","44","7","0"

Sadly, the game idea that Forced is needs much more...\n\nFor Single-Players, or Solo-Play:\n\nThe attempt at a story is more of a hinderance and should've been left out almost all together. The general direction in design is pretty spotty and left me feeling non-plussed several times as I attempted to learn one mechanic or another. The challenges are a bit too tightly setup, and are limited in scope. Thus, completing challenges unlocks abilites, and so you find yourself "forced" to wait for much good deal of the fun the game can provide, repeating the same stages over and over. Also, a key element in the game, your spirit mentor, could be so much more interesing. Last but not least, the graphics really could be better, indie or not.\n\n\nAs much as Forced is a solid idea, the production quality and execution are both sadly lackluster...and that voice acting...yikes.","April 3, 2014","false","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's pretty awesome, not gonna lie.\n\nThe game is pretty hard sometimes, but it's really fun. More than half of us 4 are impatient ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s when something doesn't go our way and we still have a lot of fun playing it.\n\nThe puzzles start out as the easiest thing ever and they quickly shift into something really weird. But pretty awesome.\nThe combat isn't the best ever, but it's definitely not bad. It's the mix of both that makes this a really fun title.\n\nIf I had to rate it, based on a limited amount of playtime, I'd say 8/10.\n\n\nI haven't played it by myself, or with only 1 or 2 people so I can't say for those groups. But 4 players is really fun. Especially if people start getting confused with who is who. Not sure how they do it but 2 of our group tend to do that, and in some levels you can't get out of a certain area or you take massive damage, and they'd just randomly venture out and die. Or think they're someone else and walk into a huge laser. It's pretty entertaining.\n\nI'd say the main reason why my rating isn't higher than 8 is because I thought there'd be a bit more puzzle-based levels. Or longer levels. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind short levels. But I find that co-op games are best when thrown into puzzle environments. Games like Trine 2, Battleblock Theater, Portal 2, Tiny Brains etc are great examples of that. (BBT isn't as much puzzle-based but you get the idea).\n\nSo it's mostly just my opinion really. I haven't seen any huge cons yet, quite a few pros, and the game was crazy cheap during the sale, 100% worth it(7.50$ for a 4pack, 2.50$ per individual game) and that's Canadian money. And our money isn't worth much lately, so you know that's a pretty decent deal.\n\nAnyway, I've talked long enough, eh? Sorry for taking all of your time if you read all this. I have to go since the dam behind my house made of poutine and maple syrup let through a family of moose... ... ...s? Is it mooses? Or just moose? Or is it Meese? That sounds like it's so wrong. But at the same time "so many moose" sounds just as wrong. I'll go with mooses. I like the sound of it. Doesn't feel right either but I like saying mooses.\n\nTL;DR\nI'm Canadian\nGame is fun\nFamily of mooses\n8/10\nCo-op, eh\nPoutine.","January 4","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's pretty awesome, not gonna lie.\n\nThe game is pretty hard sometimes, but it's really fun. More than half of us 4 are impatient ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s when something doesn't go our way and we still have a lot of fun playing it.\n\nThe puzzles start out as the easiest thing ever and they quickly shift into something really weird. But pretty awesome.\nThe combat isn't the best ever, but it's definitely not bad. It's the mix of both that makes this a really fun title.\n\nIf I had to rate it, based on a limited amount of playtime, I'd say 8/10.\n\n\nI haven't played it by myself, or with only 1 or 2 people so I can't say for those groups. But 4 players is really fun. Especially if people start getting confused with who is who. Not sure how they do it but 2 of our group tend to do that, and in some levels you can't get out of a certain area or you take massive damage, and they'd just randomly venture out and die. Or think they're someone else and walk into a huge laser. It's pretty entertaining.\n\nI'd say the main reason why my rating isn't higher than 8 is because I thought there'd be a bit more puzzle-based levels. Or longer levels. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind short levels. But I find that co-op games are best when thrown into puzzle environments. Games like Trine 2, Battleblock Theater, Portal 2, Tiny Brains etc are great examples of that. (BBT isn't as much puzzle-based but you get the idea).\n\nSo it's mostly just my opinion really. I haven't seen any huge cons yet, quite a few pros, and the game was crazy cheap during the sale, 100% worth it(7.50$ for a 4pack, 2.50$ per individual game) and that's Canadian money. And our money isn't worth much lately, so you know that's a pretty decent deal.\n\nAnyway, I've talked long enough, eh? Sorry for taking all of your time if you read all this. I have to go since the dam behind my house made of poutine and maple syrup let through a family of moose... ... ...s? Is it mooses? Or just moose? Or is it Meese? That sounds like it's so wrong. But at the same time "so many moose" sounds just as wrong. I'll go with mooses. I like the sound of it. Doesn't feel right either but I like saying mooses.\n\nTL;DR\nI'm Canadian\nGame is fun\nFamily of mooses\n8/10\nCo-op, eh\nPoutine.","January 4","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's no hot-join functionality, which means if people are trying to join in on a game they will interrupt the one already taking place.\n\nWhen playing co-op the progress is limited to the person who has the least, and not the hosts - this does not encourage players who are father ahead to stop op and play coop, when they have to play the same levels over with the same abilities.\n\nThe movement with k/m is aweful. In most levels the best ways to move is diagonal and even between the 16 directions that keyboards offers. Without a joystick some levels require very a lot of focus on movement.\n\nSoloing is possible but feels overly complicated and difficult.

Definitely the best co-op indie game I've played. So awesome, in fact, that everyone I play it with avoids continuing to play with me! I get way too into it. But it held interest for my wife and I and a friend of ours for about 20 hours of gameplay before they didn't want to listen to my ♥♥♥♥ anymore, so that's saying something. Honestly, though, the element of interacting with each other via using the orb to interact with the environment in order to navigate the map and defeat creatures and bosses... it's ingenious (I realize that was a confusing sentence but perhaps it helps properly emphasize the complexity of the game). This game gets a solid 9.5/10. It would get a 10/10 if I could find the right friends to finish the game with!

Everything is balanced for multiple players, after the first couple trials, the game simply becomes tedious if you're trying to do everything on your own.\n\nWhile I appreciate a good challenge, this game focuses on the wrong place.  The puzzles are brain-dead easy, and the single-player challenge simply comes from throwing an ever-increasing amount of mobs at you.   If it was possible to out-run these enemies and kite their numbers down, it would be manageable, but as they all move faster than you and, in many levels, respawn faster than you can kill them it makes the singleplayer game completely unenjoyable.","July 17, 2014","false","4.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Maybe a cross between DotA/LoL + WoW + Portal 2. In short you are solving puzzles in a dungeon/instances with your partner while mobs attack you.\n\nImagine sitting together with your 360 controllers (or on skype) running around avoiding a laser beam while trying to kill mobs that are attacking you. Meanwhile your co-op partner is aligning Balfus (a floating orb) in a straight line towards you and screaming at you to pull the orb so that it goes through a shrine that stops a deadly mists that is slowly filling the dungeon. You pull the orb towards you but just when the orb is about to turn off the the mist your co-op partner gets pinned by a mob he didn't avoid and needs to call the orb back to him to free himself. Now the mist is out of control and your coop partner is low on health. This is a basic scenario in Forced.\n\nThe game has several dungeons/levels that you have to complete. Each dungeon rewards a total of 3 crystals. One for completing the dungeon, one for a speed/timed run and one for completing with a special requirement (e.g no healing, not getting hit by a special mob, etc).\n\nBefore each dungeon you choose to play one of four available classes. A warrior, rogue, hunter and a tank. Every class has two talent trees: One tree for active talents and one for passive talents. As you earn more crystals you unlock more of your talents.  You get to choose 3 active and 3 passive skills. That means that you have 4 buttons to press: One for basic attack and three for active talents.\n\nThis is a game where you can play competitvely and min/max what class and what spec to play for eac dungeon. make a tactic and practice exucuting it impeccably or you can grab a 360 controller and have fun with your girlfriend on the couch.","May 26, 2014","true","62.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The payoff here is great; I received immense satisfaction from figuring out puzzles and performing insanely powerful attacks by coordinating with someone else. I firmly believe the best way to experience FORCED is with a dedicated partner or three so that you can complete the entire game with the same group of people.\n\nThat being said, the puzzles are not very complicated at all. The true difficulty will be in attempting Challenges (finishing a level while achieving a specific goal) and Time Trials (finishing a level within a certain amount of time). Completing Challenges and Time Trials will require attempt after attempt after attempt. Beta Dwarf could have planned for this a bit better and not put as many long cut scenes in inconvenient places, but you can skip after a few seconds. Nevertheless, Challenges and Time Trials give this title some serious replayability. The game is fun enough to justify multiple (read: dozens of) consecutive attempts. I did not feel like I had completed the game until I had all 75 gems, which took roughly 47 hours.\n\nThe online infrastructure can be a little rough. We had to exit out of the game and set it back up once every 1-1.5 hours or so due to game crashing bugs or unresponsive controls. However, it is important to note that the gameplay made it worth it. We kept coming back to it because of the addictive gem collecting and the fun, rewarding combat system. Mercifully, Beta Dwarf has insured that load times are minimal and creating/joining a game are very simple. This means setting up a game is a trivial affair, and the inconvenience of the (infrequent) game crashing bugs is mitigated.\n\nThe combat system is the crux of the gameplay. Basic attacks leave enemies with marks. Depending on what abilities your character has, marks can cause special attacks to do more damage.\nThe abilities you equip your character with (up to 3 active and 3 passive) give you perks and access to powerful attacks. Discovering synergy between passives and actives is one of the most compelling reasons to keep playing the game and adds strategy to what would otherwise be a mindless beat-em-up.\nGems enable you to unlock abilities and equip yourself with more abilities. There are 75 in the game, three for each level (1 for beating the level, 1 for completing the challenge, 1 for beating the Time Trial). Every few gems you score, you unlock a new ability, which adds to the sense of progress throughout the game and encourages you to experiment with your new found awesomeness.\n\n\nIt is important to note that the experience I am praising arose from me from having a friend that was dedicated to playing the game. I cannot speak to the game's singleplayer mode, but I also cannot see it providing the same sense of accomplishment, nor can I see it motivating me in the same way to attempt each level the insane number of times I did. It always helped to have someone to talk to and discuss strategies with. With that understood, I give it...\n\n8.7/10\n\nI hope Beta Dwarf keeps making awesome multiplayer games with over-the-top bosses.\n\nTL;DR : Great gameplay, adequate online connectivity, don't get it if you don't have friends.","May 2, 2014","true","52.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

At first the game teaches you the simple mechanics as you learn each of the classes. As you progress into the next world, the game does get harder, with enemies being tougher and puzzles more challenging, but as you master that world, the next is even more difficult, where you and your friends have to work very hard to complete each challenge. Has a very nice levelling and upgrade system, could use some work, balancing, etc. The only problem I have, is Singleplayer and Multiplayer difficulty scaling. Want to play past the second world by yourself? Well that is near impossible. I am not sure if this has been fixed yet, but BetaDwarf should consider to make the game easier (lower enemy spawns, health, damage, etc.) when by yourself. Also I've noticed an uneven scaling with two to three to four players. I believe three is the easiest. Other than that you'll probably snag a good 5-20 hours based on how much you enjoy it, and if you have a small group of friends this is a great game to spend those hours together. Everything is polished, the graphics, the sound, which has exceptional music. 7.5/10, would be a 9/10 if made easier for singleplayer.","May 12, 2014","true","15.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The casual player could try and hack & slash their way through the game, but for more hardcore gamers there are times to beat and challenges to conquer on every stage which require a lot more thinking and strategy.  Another great feature is that most levels usually take under 5 minutes which make this a great game to sit down to if you don't have hours and hours to play.\n\nThis is a really well made indie game that I'd say competes with the big market games.

Totally worth it! It's a sorta hack/slash rpg'ish puzzle game. You control 1 of 4 different characters (hammer, bow, shield, daggers) each has their own set of skills, passives, and playstyles. You work with your friends to navigate innovative maps and figure out puzzles all with the help of a little orb spirt guy. Every person can call this orb to their position so it can be trolly if everyone is spamming. It requires a great deal of communication as it sometimes requires you to bounce the orb from person to person but without letting it hit objects (part of the puzzle). I highly recommend you pick this up in a 4 pack and play with friends over voice chat as it can be very fun, quirky, rewarding, and frustrating all in one but there is sense of accomplishment similar to when you first beat a boss in an MMO when you nail a puzzle while 3 of your friends are dead and you are teetering on life.

Throughout the year they send warriors from their village to go deep into the realms to battle the guardians and try to defeat them, but none prevailed. After a long await four warriors came forth from the villages and started to slay the Guardians as one god tries to guide them through the realms or chaos. As the Warriors it's your destiny to send them to the right path.\n\nGraphics:\nThroughout the game the graphics for this game have been great quality and had had some amazing sceneries, not a lot is need to play this game and with a lot more room for improvement I wouldn't put any bad remarks towards this game just yet, with the design and the equipment, to the boss and bad guys. The game shows the player it can be like WoW and Rift, full of imagination and fantastic detail in the structures\n\nGame play:\nThe game play in this game was very easy to understand, with the first few levels explain how certain objects word, the game challenges you through the levels, making sure you are fully aware of what certain things do and how to stop them. The game is based on a third person play and you can roam around the game with either a keyboard and mouse or a Controller.  for those who are PC gamers keyboard and mouse was easier for the bow master, but I personally liked the controller because of close combat so try and find something that'll suit your style.

This game is awesome. It is an indie game that will test your friendships on the highest level. It plays similar to diablo, with the need for reflexes like you're playing an FPS, and the mindpower for puzzle game. The thing that I found most pleasing in this game is the difficulty.\n\nIn the past (NES/SNES/Sega) there was no difficulty level, you just dealt with what they gave you. This game can be done the easy way and still have a good time, but if you choose to go the hard route... the game will make you cry. This game is so pleasingly unforgiving and the developers as well. Having met a few I love their mentality towards the game and makes me a happy owner.\n\nFor the people complaining about the problems. BF4, Skyrim, CoD or any other AAA title that had bugs up the yin yang and still people applauded how amazing it was. Not to say those games aren't good and that the bugs weren't fixed but why is an indie developer somehow excluded from being forgiven when they fix the bugs.\n\n-\nThe game is a lot of fun, developers are awesome people with an awesome story, they actively attempt to fix bugs, challenging as heck, SPIRIT BLADES 4 LYFE!","June 28, 2014","true","39.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Totally worth it! It's a sorta hack/slash rpg'ish puzzle game. You control 1 of 4 different characters (hammer, bow, shield, daggers) each has their own set of skills, passives, and playstyles. You work with your friends to navigate innovative maps and figure out puzzles all with the help of a little orb spirt guy. Every person can call this orb to their position so it can be trolly if everyone is spamming. It requires a great deal of communication as it sometimes requires you to bounce the orb from person to person but without letting it hit objects (part of the puzzle). I highly recommend you pick this up in a 4 pack and play with friends over voice chat as it can be very fun, quirky, rewarding, and frustrating all in one but there is sense of accomplishment similar to when you first beat a boss in an MMO when you nail a puzzle while 3 of your friends are dead and you are teetering on life. The simple combat systems works perfectly as there is plenty of other object happening on the screen to keep you active and always thinking.\n\nThere isn't a game out there like this on the market that I am aware.

Throughout the year they send warriors from their village to go deep into the realms to battle the guardians and try to defeat them, but none prevailed. After a long await four warriors came forth from the villages and started to slay the Guardians as one god tries to guide them through the realms or chaos. As the Warriors it's your destiny to send them to the right path.\n\nGraphics:\nThroughout the game the graphics for this game have been great quality and had had some amazing sceneries, not a lot is need to play this game and with a lot more room for improvement I wouldn't put any bad remarks towards this game just yet, with the design and the equipment, to the boss and bad guys. The game shows the player it can be like WoW and Rift, full of imagination and fantastic detail in the structures\n\nGame play:\nThe game play in this game was very easy to understand, with the first few levels explain how certain objects word, the game challenges you through the levels, making sure you are fully aware of what certain things do and how to stop them. The game is based on a third person play and you can roam around the game with either a keyboard and mouse or a Controller.  for those who are PC gamers keyboard and mouse was easier for the bow master, but I personally liked the controller because of close combat so try and find something that'll suit your style. I play Volcanic Hammer and controller was my thing, but when it came to bow I had to switch.\nThe detail in the inventory and explanation were simple and this is what a game need as for beginner people feel comfortable knowing what's going on throughout the start and not be pressured and button mash.

Moving the ball over various level objects actives them; you flip switches, move crates, and activate temporary buffs for your character this way.  However the problem is that you have to be quite precise with these movements; the ball is often quite small in relation to the screen and must move exactly over the thing you want to active.  This demands far too much precision in a game where you're often trying to focus on combat at the same time, and dealing with an isometric camera that is frequently zooming out to fit all characters on screen.  If the ball had a larger radius of activation, it would go a long way to making the game more entertaining than frustrating.\n\nThe level of precision required is the main source of the game's excessive difficulty.  The combat by itself is reasonable, but almost everything after the first set of levels requires managing the ball to solve puzzles while fighting at the same time and the game isn't rewarding enough to make investing the effort feel worth it.","January 25, 2015","false","2.8"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","1"

The levels are fun and it encourages good teamates. Some abilities are completely worthless but it is well made how each person has a different role to play and is quite different. The problem is based off horrible limiting/restricting design decisions. For no apparent reason, they take the moronic "super meat-boy" approach of screwing you over if you can't beat the level in the exact way they intended you to. The levels are hard enough in themselves and take 5-8 minutes each. You only get new abilities for beating levels, and for beating in in a time limit they choose and by completing a challenge they made up. The first problem is you don't know the challenge till after you beat the level which shows how much they want to artificially inflate game length by having you replay the exact same level multiple times. The time limits and challenges are not even remotely fair or achievable without dozens of attempts of the exact same level, of 6 minutes or so, spending hours on a single level. Why would you not want someone to get to use abilities you made for characters? Biggest problem is that althought you can move through the entire game gaining the crystal for beating the level, the final boss requires a stupid amount of crystals, basically making my entire playthrough a waste of time because I couldn't beat the levels in the exact amount of time developers and tryhards do.........If people like repeatedly playing levels over and over give time limits and challenges that help for leaderboards and rankings, idiots eat that Sh-it up. But don't keep me from getting abilities and from beating the game without letting me know beforehand. Amateur game-making at its finest.

We played this for a few hours but eventually abandoned it when we got to a level we couldn't get past.\n\nThe game does a good job of forcing players to actually cooperate. But we found that when we only had 2-players that the levels became brutally hard. A single death meant all of the enemies homed in on the last man standing. Add in a few levels with insta-death from lazer-like barriers and we reached a level (after only 2 hours; the Slarth boss-fight) where the difficulty ramped up past our skill.\n\nA quick check of Steam stats shows that only 19% of players beat Slarth.\n\nIt stopped being fun, so we moved on to other games. Maybe it is better with 4 players? Or maybe we're just not good enough (but I've played a decent amount of Super Meat Boy so I'm not TERRIBLE). Either way, the frustration exceeded the fun for us.","January 1","false","6.0"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","11","23","2","2"

I checked the store page 3 times to make sure.\n\nThis game has terrible audio mixing that makes most combat and music either too soft or not audible at all. The sounds are extremely far away if you are using headphones. Voice acting was bad, kinda the reason I wrote that first review after playing the starting trials. This game is just one gauntlet of completionist challenges. Honestly this is battle block theater if you take the platforming away and made it too serious.\n\nReally the most laughable part is that they included a built-in twitch streaming platform. In a game that is so boring and requires co-op to be any fun, why do they need to include this? The game is the same ball puzzle, as far as I've played. Use your floating ball to activate shrines and destroy arbitrary spawners and statues.\n\nYou play the same character as everyone else just in different armor. I say charater but your just a gladiator without a name or face that wears different armor depending on what the lobby leader ♥♥♥♥♥es at you to be. It's a nice feature that you can change classes at whim so there's no commitment to a certain role. With the human husk of a character the story is terrible and the meat of the game is left to repetitive arenas one after the other.\n\nMeh, the game's just boring, noticibly unpolished, and requires multiplayer for fun. Also multiplayer is buggy and won't connect at times.\n\nSo what can you do, play a better game at least.","January 14, 2015","false","0.5"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","48","10","21","14","1"

You just wish there was a better way to work out *how* to talk to each other, and really be heard.  Well, here is the answer!  FORCED!  There is nothing to improve a relationship like coordinating where to pass a flaming ball of doom, who should focus fire on the boss and who should be on adds, or call out for your partner's help when you are getting overrun and have them valiantly come to your rescue.  This game *forces* you to work with your partner, to be aware of them at all times, and to understand that the survival of all parties involved is not only important, but practically integral to the success of many levels.\n\nYou will die.  You will die again, and again, and again.  There will be chronic confusion of who Balfus should be following.  There might be an unsavory word uttered under someone's breath here and there.  There might even be a declaration of, "This isn't worth it, I quit."  To which you will respond, "We *can* do it!"  It will be a rollercoaster of trials, testing your patience and your sanity, but once victory is achieved it provides an addictive feeling of fulfillment that pushes you, no, *forces* you forward.  You will find yourself strategizing, trying different techniques, characters and relying on your reflexes to get you through the truly chaotic portions.  You will share your frustrations with your partner, but you will also rejoice together.  One precisely placed heal will mean the difference between life and death for your partner, or that perfectly timed shout out for Balfus to be passed through a totem determining the victory of the level.  You will fall asleep with images of FORCED running through your mind, working out newly improved strategies for your next session.\n\nYou will then inevitably understand that the most important rule of FORCED, and of relationships, is:\n\nUnited you will stand, divided you will fall.","January 5, 2015","true","21.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

What I got was a poorly optimized game with iOS game-style level design and netcode issues.\n\nOne of the primary mechanics in the game is this orb which each player can call to their location. It seems all puzzles, if you can even call them that, are based on this mechanic. The problem here is that these puzzles are all really uninventive and quite frankly boring, and using the orb for all puzzles doesn't make for a rewarding and interesting experience.\n\nThe level design reminds me of iOS games because of its infatuation of having really short, play-while-you're-on-the-toilet missions which give you a ranking between 1 and 3 depending on how well you did. One for completing the level, one for doing some special thing, and one for doing it quickly. I really think this is a horrible practice for PC games and I was hoping for some Diablo-style adventuring which would fit the game a lot better than how it is now.\n\nThese problems combined with the shoddy netcode (this was playing with 3 others with pings varying between 10-30ms) lead to a really unresponsive and disapointingly mediocre experience.","January 17, 2015","false","1.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

FORCED. Seems good, no weight.\n\nOkay, now for the lengthy bit....\n\nWhat do you mean by 'no weight'? well, that's pretty straight forward really, every strike, stab, stomp and shot you perform has no impression of impact in the sound or visual effects, it doesn't feel like you are striking down someone to the pits of the earth, it feels like you are pushing them over so they gentle fall onto a bed.\n\nNow, while this may make sense for the assassin-type character, this should not be the case with the warrior wielding a freaking HUGE FLAMING AXE.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the art-style is nice, the puzzles are cool, the soundtrack would be nice if you didn't have to choose between silence or being deafened and perhaps that's also the reason the fighting sucks, you have to turn the game sounds so far down in order to be able to hear your friends that you miss out on any subtle sounds such as impacts and also miss out on the soundtrack. The guide however? Oh, he'll violate your ear-drums silly if you don't shut him up quickly.\n\nOverall, FORCED probably isn't that bad, but it just wasn't mine or my friends' cup of tea.

The biggest is a working program. I can overlook bugs, I can overlook the occassional crash. What I cannot do is spend hours trying to get something to work. This game seemed right up my alley considering I have very little time to game; relatively quick levels, freedom to revisit levels, and fairly simple controls (good for when I go weeks without being able to game.)\nThe problem I'm encountering is constant crashing, every time I played the game it crashed during a fight. Out of the 100+ games I have on Steam this and Dungeon Defenders don't work. Dungeon Defenders is an issue with my setup and I haven't had time to try the recommended fixes. Unfortunately this game doesn't even give me any clue as to why it crashes. It just freezes and can't be stopped through task manager because it stays as the fore window.\nAlthough this cost next to nothing (on sale) I would still like something that doesn't require me to jump through a ton of hoops in order to get back to a working system.\nGood effort and probably a great game, but I will never know because my time is more valuable than the reward of playing a game that has nothing truly unique.","January 14, 2015","false","2.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You have completely unique puzzles for anywhere from 1 to 4 players, and frequently puzzles will require all members of a team.\n\nIt has challenges for each stage (beat it in X time, etc), but they are absurdly difficult, so I recommend you play through the story, then that's it.

It is lacking in the RPG department though, no leveling up at all or skill points.

Your character is followed by the light ball called Balfus who will interact with various objects in game . This escpecially very fun in coop mod where players have to share the ball .\n\nThis game also reminds me crash bandicoot because each level features 3 crystals which you can unlock by completing challanges . Crystal basicly unlock new skills which you can use between 4 uniqe characters .\n\nIt is not really RPG game but more like survivor arena . Also I should note that this game utilizes steam community very well . It keeps scores of all players,friends and uses profile icons .

Since each mission is its own little arena it's easy to pick up and play for a little while with people joining and leaving as they like, although I'd encourage you to play with friends to get the most (screaming and fighting over the shiny ball) out of it! ^^ Each class is tied to weapons and you "level" all the classes at the same time. Classes are divided between players so you can't play the same thing, which also encourages teamwork and letting the best suited for different tasks do their thing, but you can also switch classes freely between each mission. Since you can also skip some missions, it means you can decide difficulty by avoiding harder ones if you really want to, but I for one found the difficulty on an appropriate level. As far as co-op games goes this one is nearly perfect.\n\nThe controls feels sharp and responsive, and the skills fairly intuitive. You can fight a boss without taking damage by timing dodges perfectly, or you can die miserably by doing it poorly. There's a nice balance between individual skill and teamwork that you usually (hopefully) find in MOBAs like LoL and DotA, but to me what it reminds me most of is running dungeons in WoW, minus the gear frenzy and hunter pets pulling all the mobs. Overall, I strongly recommend Forced, especially in four-packs.\n\nTrying to think of anything bad... we've had occasional random lag/framedrops for no apparent reason, but not a lot. There used to be some crippling network issues that appear to have been resolved. It seems some of the missions are in fact impossible to solo, but since you can skip some levels that may be possible to go around, I haven't tried. Although I have to say you kinda miss out on the point if you play it alone.","March 13, 2014","true","11.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay is beautiful in its simplicity, and hair-pullingly hard as a solo experience, though I suppose I can't say that any of my failures were anyone's fault by mine.\n\nIt may seem silly, but I believe that this game truly shines in its progression, which gave way to effective level design. There are no discrete levels, only up to three gems earned in each stage as a reward for completion, completing a special challenge during the level, and completing the level within a certain time limit.  New skills are unlocked after players amass enough gems.  As I earned gem after gem, it rewarded me with new toys to play with because of it.  Because there is no leveling up, there is no stat inflation, and each level is designed to challenge players based solely on the mechanics it presents, and I think that goes a long way toward the game's effective balance of challenge and reward.\n\nEach of the four classes plays differently, which makes replaying levels to earn more gems, or improve a time, or even just for the hell of it that much more entertaining.  With all of those possible combinations, how could one resist experimentation?  It was that process of refining my approach to a level until I had conquered it that truly made the experience memorable for me, and I'd highly recommend it for anyone who's up for that sort of challenge.","February 12, 2014","true","44.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There isn't even an explanation about it, I still don't know if the gem numbers on servers represent the required number to join or just an indication to the host's "level"\n\nIt's hard to give this game a note because there isn't something to compare it too. I think it can be polished some more and it sure needs the difficulty to be decreased for more casual players. Right now it feels like you are taking part in a championship or tournament that has no prize at the end making all the frustrating experience to go through all of it pointless.\n\nMaybe some extra levels at the end or a fifth class to be unlocked could have made it more interesting, especially to encourage co-op replayability.\n\nI will give it a 7/10 though especially for the idea, effort and team commitment.","January 18, 2015","true","6.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Good luck finding anyone else who wants to play this game besides yourself though. It is a below average game at best, based primarily around puzzle solving with really bad generic boring combat. It is best forgotten to games of a much better quality, mainly games that have a single player campaign that doesn't require co op assistance, or at least isn't so incredibly frustrating that it is a complete turn off. This game is very easily forgotten in a sea of other, much more awesome games. It would be a lot better if the combat didn't suck so much and was less frustrating on some challenges that are clearly easier with a partner which you won't find unless you ask strangers in the forums maybe. Oh and did I mention the combat is generic and boring and takes a back seat to puzzle solving?

Horrible, horrible gamepad/keyboard support, it just switches randomly, we have to restart games all the time because during loading the game decides to ignore my controller\n2. Horrible stability. Lags, disconnects, twitching, stuttering. Game is nowhere near complex or pretty enough to lagg on my beast of a machine.\n3. UI and lack of options. There are just too many things wrong with the UI, the way you setup things, game needs more solid visual identifiers, especially during the hectic missions.\n4. Polish. This game badly needs one. So many bugs, from visual ones where you can't even see because of the "SPACE SPACE SPACE" all over the screen, to glitches and teleports.\n5. Lack of skill variety. It might seem that there is a ton of skills, but many are just plain bad, plus many are about creating marks on enemies, with very little skills to remove them often enough.\n\nTLDR -> If you want a 4man coop top down twin stick brawler, buy and play Gauntlet, that's a solid example of a polished, smooth game.","December 26, 2015","false","9.7"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

I really wanted to like it but the experience the game gave just declined over the course of 14 hours. Let's start from the beginning.\n\nI bought this game pretty much right after it came out in 2013 and played it with 2 other friends. The net-code was unstable at launch which made it extremely difficult to get online co-op games (one of the main selling points) to work. When it did work though it was great entertainment. However, an unstable multiplayer was not the only mechanical issue I ran into and I crashed several times. Add numerous bugs and you have a less than stellar experience. A year later I picked up the game to finish it and while the net-code has gotten better it's still wonky and there are still bugs throughout, in fact the last boss fight of the game was more or less ruined as the big bad evil guy crapped out on me and was stuck in his walking cycle unnable to attack.\n\nEven with those mechanical flaws I still managed to have a good time but at the halfway mark of the game things just go down hill. See the game is structured a lot like an old Crash Bandicoot game (the second one to be exact). The game is split into worlds that has a series of levels along with a boss fight. Every level has 3 crystals to obtain. The first is obtained by simply beating the level, the second by completing a challenge tied to the level and finally a crystal based on completion time.\n\nThe structure works really well and here's why: The game is a mix of RPG, Hack 'N' Slash and light Puzzle elements. Your character has active abilities, passive abilities and a special ability tied to each of the 4 classes (Hammer charges over time, bow can be charged manually, shield blocks etc.). However, in order gain new abilities you need to get crystals by beating levels. This creates a very real incentive to complete levels several times to pick up all the crystals.\n\nThis brings us to the levels themselves and the puzzle element. Throughout the game you'll be escorted by Balfus a flying orb that might as well have been called Navi. Balfus has a lot of quips throughout the game and he happily chats away whenever he's given the chance and becomes real grating, real fast. Especially when constantly replaying levels to get those final crystals. Now the levels are structured so that you need Balfus to activate several items and objects by making him fly into them and for the first half of the game it's great fun to play with all the different objects in the world and there are some really creative puzzles in there. Like I said though, at the half way point it seriously starts to feel like you're simply going through the motions and things become repetitive just like Balfus' endlessly repeating lines.\n\nAnother few gripes I feel deserve mentioning are the bosses whom have way to much health for their own good, seriously they are ♥♥♥♥ing sponges soaking damage like high-end kleenexes. The mark system which adds extra damage from abilities and basic attacks don't do enough to quickly wear down bosses at a reasonable rate and the boss levels which are supposed to be epic become tedious. The fact that the invisible creatures can only be spotted by Balfus and the fact there's only one Balfus and most likely more than one player it is aggrivating to kill just one, especially when they have enough health to soak several fully marked abilities. I could go on but I think I've made my point.\n\nIn conclusion, I feel really bad for not recommending the game because I know this is the first game by the dev team and I know they worked really hard on it, but it just lacks polish and the player-experience is not optimal as a result. If you really want to play this game, get it on sale.","August 25, 2014","false","14.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

When the players are further apart than half a screen, your view gets offset and zoomed out to keep all players onscreen. You are no longer the center of your screen. It was a very poor design choice.\n\nSecondly, some of the challenges require specific skill combinations. Part of the challenge is figuring that out. I detest this use of the skill sets. I would like to play using skills I enjoy, not skills that I must use to progress. That is another very poor design choice.\n\nMy last gripe is that I don't feel like the game has much replayability.

The sad truth is the game is such garbage that I had 3 corrupted video files before I stopped trying.\n\nBetween the 4 of us, my friends and I have between medium and advanced gaming rigs... mine being the best. All four of us had repeated game crashes every time we tabbed out of the game, for me it was to start/stop Audacity and for them it was either accident or to check their Twitch streams. However if that was the only issue it wouldn't be too bad, the major issue is this crash in the ended up causing all of our computers to crash and need to be manually restarted. After the 3rd try I stopped tabbing out and decided to run everything before opening the gamem which worked until one of my friends accidentally hit "Main Menu". When he did this, it kicked the 3 remaining players out of the game, crashed the game, and forced a manual restart.\n\nLastly, the least minor thing but during our play none of us could use the controller even though it was an option. The controller settingers were optimized however every time one of us selected the controller it wouldn't allow that person to "ready-up" until they went back to the keyboard. Why even make something an option if your game won't allow you to use it?\n\nThis game honestly isn't worth your time. We were the only people to have a room in the lobby and that was on a Saturday night, so theres little to no chance of finding a game unless you're solo or your friends were dumb enough to buy this game with you. Sadly, my friends and I attempted to play this game for over 2 hours and I fear we wont get our money back.\n\nRating: 2/10 - Only because they suckered me into buying the deluxe so I can look like more of a bada$$ than my friends.","September 20, 2015","false","2.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

These levels involve combat, as well as puzzle solving mechanics where players move and place floating orbs over certain objects for a variety of effects.\n\nIf you enjoy time challanges, Diablo, or are looking for a co-op game with friends you will be hard pressed to find a better value than FORCED at the current time!\n\nYou can see my other opinions on the game here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKAMfFPIn0A","January 27, 2014","true","2.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

While I've not had any issues with the game other than some graphical glitches, it's been nice to see the developers actively improving the game (better multiplayer connections, better controller support, other bug fixes, and several tweaks to solo play).\n\nIt's an action RPG in the same genre as Diablo, Torchlight, etc., but with several twists.  It's much more puzzle based, but combat is still an integral part.  Classes are based on the 4 available weapons, and switching classes can be done with no penalty between levels.  Skills are unlocked by completing levels and challenges (one time and one other per level) to get crystals, which unlock abilities at certain numbers and is not tied to a class.  There's no gear progression, so there's no grinding.  In multiplayer, everyone has to have a crystal for it to be available for that play session, so everyone is on an equal footing.\n\nI picked this up because it was compatible with Macs, and I've really enjoyed it.  I've played with 1, 2, 3, and 4 players, tried all 4 classes and have 72/75 crystals.\n\nSome levels/challenges are significantly easier for either solo or multiplayer (time challenges tend to be more relaxed in multiplayer, but other challenges that require no one screwing up is much easier solo).  Also, the archer seems to be much more powerful compared to the other classes in solo because it is the only class with a ranged basic attack.  Furthermore, once you have 75/75 crystals, I feel there's currently limited replay value, even if you choose a different class.

The challenges that my friends and I faced has caused us the necessary frustration but the possibility of completing it has kept us at it. We are 70% past the game and honestly, my only wish were that it could be longer as we do love the game.\n\nThe upside are the stages which are initially simple but you can opt to do the challenges which are much harder and have forced our team to use special set-ups in our attempt to conquer them. A fond way to think of it would be like a 10-25 man dungeon raid you would experience in some of the MMO's but that your team was reduced to 4, including you. Although you can play it single player, it is a much better game to play with friends and I would say your enjoyment rises exponentially with each friend you play with.\n\nThe downside is that the game is relatively short, if you play without the challenges, you can easily complete in maximum of 1-2 days?\n\nThis is one of the most challenging games and its still worth every cent.","January 13, 2014","true","17.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

There are some small glitches and problems you may run into while playing online, but thankfully, it's never game-breaking.\n\nI would suggest this game for anyone who likes having a good multiplayer experience, especially since every character in the game has a completely different moveset.

(You are able to skip this if you press esc and then choose that option).\nThe game is played in a "twin stick" way. (like robotron).\nThe music is well done. However sound has a chance to only be heard from one side of the headset/speaker.\nThe graphics is okay.\nThe sound is okay.\nYou are able to access the options. The game will be paused, audios will continue.\nThere are different weapon and styles.\nThere is a perk system.\nYou will see the enemy Health bar.\nThe blue ball is the camera, which allows you to see more. You can also use him to activate some things.\nThere are some challenges and time challenge in each dungeon.\nIf you have died then, you can no longer unlock those challenges in your current run. You will respawn back however.\nEach Dungeon has 3 Challenges.\n\n\nOther things.\nNever take Rankings/highscore serious in games. They will always get hacked by lame pathetic players.\nTry different styles to achieve certain challenges, or try them later once you have unlocked more.\nYou play more with balls then with enemies.\nIf you are playing on a controller. Some spells/abilities are very difficult to cast.\nGame is somewhat annoying, that alot of attacks gives you a knockback once hit.\nGame is Repetive.\nSometimes you forget the ball during combat.. There is a chance and the camera will become very terrible.\n\n------------\n\ni give this game a 6/10","December 27, 2015","false","3.3"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Master, Sound and music. (Master is both).\nYou can play this Co-op or single player.\nYou can choose between Campaign or Survival mode.\nYou are able to play this game with a Xbox controller. However without Rumble.\nit has alot of Resolution Sizes.\nYou can play fullscreen or window mode.\nYou can turn on the subtitles.\nThe game has many different Languages.\nYou can Choose the Quality level.\nYou are able to turn on or off the Vsync\nThere is a ranking.\nYou are able to make multiple Profiles.\n\n\n\nAbout the game.\nThe game is fully Voiced over with subtitle text(if turned on)\nThe game has an in-built Tutorial. (You are able to skip this if you press esc and then choose that option).\nThe game is played in a "twin stick" way. (like robotron).\nThe music is well done. However sound has a chance to only be heard from one side of the headset/speaker.\nThe graphics is okay.\nThe sound is okay.\nYou are able to access the options. The game will be paused, audios will continue.\nThere are different weapon and styles.\nThere is a perk system.\nYou will see the enemy Health bar.\nThe blue ball is the camera, which allows you to see more. You can also use him to activate some things.\nThere are some challenges and time challenge in each dungeon.\nIf you have died then, you can no longer unlock those challenges in your current run. You will respawn back however.\nEach Dungeon has 3 Challenges.\n\n\nOther things.\nNever take Rankings/highscore serious in games. They will always get hacked by lame pathetic players.\nTry different styles to achieve certain challenges, or try them later once you have unlocked more.\nYou play more with balls then with enemies.\nIf you are playing on a controller. Some spells/abilities are very difficult to cast.\nGame is somewhat annoying, that alot of attacks gives you a knockback once hit.\nGame is Repetive.\nSometimes you forget the ball during combat.. There is a chance and the camera will become very terrible.\n\n------------\n\ni give this game a 6/10","December 27, 2015","false","3.3"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Its an alright puzzle game, but nothing particularly compelling. Definitely not worth the $14.99 sticker price.\n\nPros: Different weapon sets are useful for different levels, decent co-op play. Low cost on sale.\nBosses you beat become toned down normal enemies in following levels, which introduces some neat mechanics in mundane combat.\n\ncons: Almost no replayability. Progression requires you to beat levels under a timer and while adhering to generally more difficult challenges, so look forward to playing all of them several times as you go through the story.\nLow variety of enemies. You'll see the same ones every single level.\nPuzzles are highly simplistic. Out of 20 story levels only a handful aren't painfully obvious. About half of challenges are super easy to get and you'll end up reaching them just by playing the level, the rest are frustrating and include a strong element of luck requiring you to replay the level multiple times.\nStunlock for days. Not all classes have invincibility frames, and several enemy types can pin you against the wall or dogpile you and stunlock you to death. The completely invisible enemies that attack from invis without breaking it only add to this, as they make some attacks legitimately unavoidable.\nCamera is terribad. It has a maximum zoom and a fixed angle, combined with all the knockbacks its not unsual to have people stuck offscreen.\nAlmost no multiplayer scene: less than five games at a time, coming off of an 85% off sale. Unless you've got friends who own it or buy a fourpack look forward to going it alone.\n","October 19, 2015","false","9.3"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

Recently they have added so you can get up to 12 more crystals from Survival modes, but it's not as helpful late game as it is doing it as early as possible.\nAs you level up you gain Perks, Abilities, or a spot for a new one.\nHowever, the later it gets the more crystals you will need to get new things, easily trapping you with whatever you have and hoping that you can beat the next level.\nWhat I don't like is that even if you play the same level 50 times, you will not get anything from it, especially if you're stuck on it and you can't do any other time/challenge things.\nI'm still not sure if I recommend this game, it's really frustaring when you stand there with no ways to get the next unlock, but you're also stuck and can't continue.\n\nIn the end, I will not recommend the game, for the way it treats unlocks, and singleplayer is nearly unable to do if you're an achivement ♥♥♥♥♥ like I am.","January 24","false","21.4"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

It's one, if not, THE funnest (local) co-op game I have played with friends. I say local, because I mainly played this mode, only a few times online/single player. And local is probably where the most fun is, since communication is a BIG part of the game.\n\nI think I like about anything in the game, it's challenging, has a satisfying progression system, the challenges give levels nice variations, very descent amount of content, the orb makes for some unique gameplay, option to choose out of a good amount of character skills (and easy to change it up)\n\nI think everyone who loves to play co-op with friends should have this game in their library. If there ever is a sequel, I will buy it in a heartbeat. It's a shame there aren't more games like this one.

I picked it up to play with one other friend, but I'm excited to try 3- and 4-player mode sometime in the future. It's hectic fun, challenging without being too grindy or rage-inducing. It's a charming, colourful top-down ARPG hack-and-slash with puzzle elements, with a silent protagonist (or four) backed up by a surprisingly witty supporting cast, vibrant level design and a solid and uncomplicated - yet functional - combat and progression system. Thoroughly recommend, though I hear the single-player mode is nothing to write home about. The true pleasure of this game, though, lies in the co-op mode.

Challenges are a nice feature, which allow you to unlock more skills and have a bunch of fun in doing so. Skills are varied, and the classes all play differently - if you're playing with mulitple players, it's fun to have a quick discussion about how your team's skills interrelate and so switch them up appropriately for a given challenge.\nChallenges exist both as time challenges and level-specific challenges, some as basic as killing a certain enemy in a specifc way, whilst others are very niche, such as to solving a puzzle and touching a flag,\nI haven't finished this game, but as soon as I've got the local players ready we'll be jumping straight onto this game to get those last few skills and levels complete.\nIf it's on sale, this is a very cheap way to have several hours of fun with your friends. I can't vouch for online co-op being fantastic, however if you and your friends have good microphones and internet connections I don't see why it should be much worse than playing with them in the flesh.\nWe all used console controllers (Official Xbox 360 controller with dongle, Xbox One controller with USB cable, and PS3 controllers with Better DS3 - only the PS3 controllers broke down on occasion), and the controls themselves are perfectly simple and easy to pick up.\n\ntl;dr: Cheap game, lots of fun.

Bought the 4 pack during the last steam sale and had a blast going through the levels. Each level is a cleverly designed arena with unique challenges. While difficult to beat the first time, each level also has a time trial and a bonus objective to complete. Beating levels, clearing under a time limit, and completing the bonus objective provides gems which unlock upgrades. Upgrades are unlocked at gem levels, so you can switch between any of the 4 playable characters at any time. Almost all the upgrades are useful and unique, so different players can have very different styles even with the same character.\n\nMy only complaint about the game is that one of the later levels appears to be bugged in multiplayer and can't be completed.","January 14, 2015","true","18.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played this LOCALLY with a gamepad and a keyboard.  Great controls on either end.\n\nI found myself strategizing with my teammate(s) and generally having fun. Most levels after the first world (there are 4, I think) have an amazing level of difficulty.  Each level has three gems - beat the level, a "challenge" and a time trial. I generally skipped the time trial as that required you to really strategize in between waves and try over and over again to beat the level within the time limit.  Seemed like a waste of my gaming time to me, so I left it alone. however! Some of the challenges were actually really cool and most definitely add replayability.\n\nFor instance, a level would be about moving blocks around and solving a puzzle, killing some dudes, and then finding the end banner.  Easy enough, allows you to use your brain, and you get to fight quite a bit.  The challenge? Don't get hit by suicide monsters.  Adds some good challenge, but it isn't terribly difficult.  Strategy for those levels takes 1 minute or less, and a little bit of talking which is perfect.  Time trials are a different story - lots of strategy, retrying levels, and I would almost say are next to impossible with less than 3 players.\n\nIn the end, I recommend this very highly to anyone that has even one other person they like to play games with. Netcode is great, no noticable lag, and steam has some great voice chat.\n\nPlay!","July 8, 2014","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's quite an interesting puzzler that offers some interesting challenges but some brute force is occasionally required. A couple of the levels are incredibly buggy although generally doesn't prevent you from finishing the level. Some level instructions can be unnecessarily cryptic which really isn't required and can lead to frustration. While it's possible to play with different groups, the gem sharing can mean you have to repeat levels which can be boring so would recommend playing with the same set of people.","October 14, 2014","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game takes place in many small trials that could take minutes to complete. Each trial contains puzzles and enemy encounters. Although usually boss rooms don't contain many puzzles.\n\nThe pick up and play gameplay is definitely something that keeps me coming back for more. Also there are four classes with different skills, but they all level at the same time and you can jump between them. Which is nice, although I'm not quite sure how balanced this is.","December 18, 2013","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At times it gets kind of mundane because there all there is is just hacking and slashing, but that feeling quickly dissipates by the fact that there is so many things going on at once.  The puzzles are not very hard figure out, but at times sometimes hard to accomplish because you are being bombarded with hordes of enemies.
