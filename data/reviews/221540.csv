There is a large selection of tower types and a 'boost' tower which can be used for cheap maze creation. There is a selection of tower 'bonus' items that randomly drop after missions which can be applied to towers.\nThere is a large variety of enemy types, with unique abilities from shields to foes that can disable your defenses and alot in between.\nThe campaign is a decent length with a nice variety of levels and multiple gameplay types.\n\n\nSome of the things that grate on my nerves.\nThe dialogue and voice acting unfortunately is terrible, it's actually annoying to the point where for the first time ever in a game I have disabled the voice audio.\nThe story isn't great. Now I will quickly say a TD does NOT need a story to be good, but when it does attempt a story it must not be bad otherwise it drags the feel of the campaign down.\nThe gameplay feels very repetitive, and it shouldn't but it's not holding my attention. I only finished the campaign to finish it. I was really trying to find something that made me say wow awesome I love this game, but I haven't yet.\n\nSummary\nThis is a solid TD game, but unfortunately I cannot recommend it for what it does at it's current price.\nI do not regret buying it but I couldn't recommend it for a friend to spend their money on.\nThis is not the definitive TD game as the store page claims. This is just another TD game though while it's good, it's not great enough to stick it's head above the pile.\nI would say worth picking up in a sale as it does do a lot well but as I said before, I wouldn't recommend to a friend, so I cannot recommend it here at it's current value.\n\nI will keep an eye on updates and occasionally jump back into the game. If I find something that changes my opinion I will update my review.","October 23, 2014","false","13.1"," 123 of 152 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","123","152","0","0"

Buy DG1 instead - it's a much better game.\n\nThis new version has a stupid story, a variety of useless support weapons (the resource one is always going to be the best) and difficulty so unsteady you'll wonder if it was ever tested. The last few levels of the campaign are a joke - you will never feel threatened, unlike in DG1. Some levels in the middle of the campaign are difficult but otherwise the game is a cakewalk that presents little challenge (again, compared to DG1), even if you are trying to "max out" every level. Also, there is workshop support but the place is barren. Clearly, this game never took off as I had hoped it would.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/paralipsis/recommended/221540/","paralipsis","paralipsis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/paralipsis/","504 products in account","This is a sequel done right. There's enough content here to provide new challenges to players who have mastered the original Defense Grid, but at the same time, this is still very much the same kind of game in all the right ways.\n\nAt first glance, the new content seems only modest compared to what is familiar. Almost all the old tower types and enemies are back, but the handful of new types of each and subtle rebalancing of the existing towers mean that new strategies need to be developed.\n\nDG2 offers a plethora of choices as to how you play the game. From separate leaderboards that either allow or forbid juggling, difficulty levels from casual to very challenging, and even more game modes for each map than the first game, this takes what was until now the definitive tower defense game and makes it even better.\n\nThere have been some substantial changes to the economy and scoring system which, while I feel personally make for a more challenging game, do substantially alter the challenge curve of the basic level type. Gone is the compound interest earned from penny pinching. Instead, score is accrued independently from income. Efficiency is still rewarded, as you score more for killing each alien while you have less invested in towers. But the income from killing each enemy is unaffected, and additional income is a steady tick rather than being dependent on the amount you have banked. All this means that you can't just develop an optimised strategy for the early waves, and then find yourself with a huge bankroll. Levels can be genuinely challenging from beginning to end, and not just for people looking for pure score optimisation. I know this may actually be a bit of a disappointment for some, as the old game could sometimes be great for some uncomplicated unwinding at the end of a rough day. That is still there, but you'll have to dial the game back to easy in order to find that kind of experience.\n\nI will say that I have yet to try the multiplayer modes, so I can't yet speak to that experience. But with that caveat aside, I wholeheartedly recommend DG2 to fans of the original and anyone even vaguely interested in the tower defence genre. If you're going to give these kinds of games a go, why not start off with the very best there is on offer?","September 23, 2014","true","27.5"," 95 of 121 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","95","121","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/recommended/221540/","aussiedroid","Aussiedroid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/","744 products in account","Defense Grid: The Awakening (DG1) set the gold standard for Tower Defence games on PC - it is arguably the King of TD! It ticked all the boxes with insane replayability, challenging score based gameplay & a big list of levels & modes. It was the perfect balance for many gamers with some clocking thousands of hours of play time. In all the years to follow, no Tower Defense game has toppled DG1 from its throne - but now there is a serious contender from Hidden Path's own stables.\n\nSo, is DG2 the worthy successor to the crown?\n\nAll the components that made DG1 are essentially in DG2 plus more! That means pretty much all the towers return, along with the Aliens. Similar number of campaign levels on offer & Fletcher returns with some new 'friends' to provide some raspberry comic relief. I got a bit lost with all the new AI voices & story twists but that is not super important for a TD game.\n\nIt plays like it’s the same game with more detailed graphics & enhanced mechanics. Everything is a little more refined, that includes a few more modes to challenge, medals for all difficulty levels, extra power-up & commander upgrade options & some dynamic 'moveable' maps. These newer elements add more tactical & strategic options to your arsenal.\n\nOnline has got a lot of attention with Multiplayer being added. This was like playing a whole different game! My favourite mode is DG Fighter. In this you face off against a competitor, each of you has your own map in which each kill you make spawns an alien on their map in the location you killed it. Games were hectic, intense and generally close with the ability to counter each other's defenses in real-time. It is excellent fun! There is also a full co-op mode where you share the same map squares & resources, which actually wasn't as much fun as I hoped it would be. For that, you really need a good understanding with your partner & not playing with random matchmaking people.\n\nThe third mode was a bit of a hybrid, with players being allocated set squares on the same map, defending the same cores but competing for kills. It was all a bit confusing for many I think on how to best play this mode which limited its appeal. Finding players was a bit inconsistent, but it was well designed to allow you to play single player while you wait in the multiplayer queue. What was not-so-well designed was managing with dropouts. I experienced a lot of defeated players who would rather drop the game than suffer a loss - this will also mean the end your game too & prevent you from recording a high score or achieving a medal. Frustrated me to no end! It would have also been nice to browse a list of active games to join.\n\nAnother welcome addition is the level editor for community created levels! This will really add to DG2's longevity, although, I was disappointed to see the Steam Workshop is only used to submit for paid maps. Might be a technical limitation with Steam & there is an external community run site[www.dg2freemaps.com] to get free maps, but having it all integrated in Steam would have been really nice. Both paid & free maps to encourage the community to keep on playing & exploring content. At time of writing this, there is only 4 official paid maps available via Hidden Path store, but close to 20 or more via the external site.\n\nOn a more positive note, I really liked the introduction of the Boost Tower. This tower acts as a simple block on an empty square, but it also provide a tower built on it greater line of sight & power-up options that enhance the tower; like revealing stealth units or score/damage boosts. These power-ups also make the Command Tower from the original game redundant (hence no longer in DG2). There is a command structure on each map though which provides level modifications for purchase. These raise or move sections of the maps to give more building options and better defenses. They add variety to each play though, but felt they were a bit under-utilised. After several runs at a level you often find you don't use them anymore.\n\nThere are some other differences that set DG2 apart from its predecessor. On a minor point, there are no flying aliens (I always found them a distraction so I don't mind they are gone!) & on a larger point there is a new scoring system. Now, I need to take a moment to explain this further as it is a deciding factor that does change the feel of the game.\n\nDG1 scoring system was time based; this meant the longer you can keep the aliens in the map, the more interest on your resources you got & a higher score. This was somewhat flawed in design as it encouraged players to 'juggle' aliens on the map as long as possible & do things like sell towers for extra interest near the end of the level. In DG2, the scoring system is efficiency based; this means when you kill an alien you get a set score for the alien plus a bonus based on the amount of resources. No more increasing interest over time, but there is a periodic drip of supplies you get at key waves. The result puts the importance back on killing aliens & making sure they don’t escape with a core. You can still juggle to improve efficiency but the length of time is no longer a factor.\n\nAlthough it is a more logical scoring system, for me it doesn't have the same tactile response (or feel) you get when you are doing well. In DG1, you could see by the resource score ticking faster & faster along with the combination of the effectiveness of your towers in real time to really feel how well you were doing - it felt precise in a weird way. In DG2, there is now an in-game real time graph which helps negate the lack of 'ticking', but I find it is still harder to judge just how much better you are doing. I think this is due to the very small window (zoomed in) graph you see & the relative impact (or lack of?) towers seem to make to your score/efficiency. It's different, but for me even though the old system was flawed it was simply more fun to play. The flaws gave DG its character & a unique style of play which now seems lost to a certain degree.\n\nDG2 wins on many fronts, but my conclusion is that DG1 retains the crown. If it were an Olympic 100 meter sprint, it would be a photo finish down to the milliseconds! If the old scoring system rules were available as an alternative play mode I think there would be a new king!\n\nDG2 is still a fantastic game despite my preference for the old scoring system, that's really deserved of every strategist & tower defence fan's game collection.\n\nUpdate 2015: The old scoring system is back!! Players now have the choice between the new and old scoring systems. This is great!! Many thanks to Hidden Path for continuing to improve this awesome game.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","January 15, 2015","true","100.3"," 59 of 72 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","59","72","2","9"

That said I didn't like this one.\n\nPros:\nTower effects are pretty well made I guess\nThat's it\n\nCons:\nSimplistic enemy design. The aliens have 2 that look like gorillas and the rest just look like land fish, they don't have much detail to them and some are so small it's hard to see any detail.\n\nForced coop, the game says coop and it does, in fact, HAVE coop. That said it's basically just single player with 2 people. You share resources both have access to all towers, the only benefit to having another person is a second use of the special ability and possibly bringing towers with different upgrades. I honestly afk'd to take a shower while my friend beat the map we were on himself because sometimes it's a hinderence to have the other player, like when you go to place a tower and they use up just enough resources that you can't do it, or they remove your towers because they don't know why you placed it there. It was a pretty poorly thought out system.\n\nTower upgrades unlock at random, my friend and I played every map together, but sometimes one of us would get an upgrade and the other wouldn't, or we'd both get upgrades but they were different, one of my first upgrades was for a tower we didn't unlock untill 2 levels later.\n\nThe special abilities suck, once you gain access to the one that gives you resources there's no reason to bring the others ever. They all have a 5 min cooldown so the resource one is the only one that feels like it helps that much because it helps buy/upgrade towers. Compared to that a laser that kills maybe 10 enemies, or a beam to boost nearby towers for maybe 30 seconds is garbage.\n\nNo easy way to find information, I wanted to find out what kind of upgrades I could hope to get for the towers but I can't find it online let alone in game. The games difficulty varies alot but part of the difficulty comes from them not explaining things (At least for us as we've never played the first game and maybe they explain it there). For example the alien discriptions seems to indicate a weakness enemies have but there's no way to find it. The towers uses aren't explained when they're first introduced unless they're obvious like the slow tower, so you have to place them to figure out what use they may have. The space ship that lands on the the core and releases enemies half way through the map wasn't explained either and caused our only loss.\n\nI tend to like tower defense that let you build mazes and alter the enemy path, but only about half the maps in this let you do that. The rest have you placing turrets on the side of the roads which is much less interesting.\n\nThe dialog sucks, it's almost painful to listen to since it seems so awkward, so I turned off subtitles and lowered voice volume and event frequency to minimum so I never even know they're there. The fact the AI's pretty much just chit chat as you're trying to set up your defense means you probably won't pay much attention to it, or if you do it'll be more of a distraction than any game enhancement.\n\nThe game gives you no time to see the map before you start the waves, I can understand not being able to build towers till the waves start but because we had to start building immediately there were often platforms we didn't notice till the level was almost finished. It's just something that screws you the first time you play but is made worse by the fact the game has absolutely zero replay value.\n\nThe towers themselves are a mixed bag too, the laser turret for example is pretty much useless in our builds, it has the same damage as an inferno turret has slightly better range but is only single target which makes it much worse for us, it's line of sight issues also make it a pretty poor choice. The missle turret again wasn't explained at all so I didn't realized that it starts with almost no damage at it's first tier but upgrades it's damage very well. The concussion turret does good damage but fires insanely slow making it's first tier pretty useless too, also it fires at random and sometimes just feels like it spends too much time dropping grenade things on nearby turrets instead of on the enemy path. Some times the tower upgrades will make a pretty much useless turret a decent choice like acid bullets for the gun turret (Otherwise the gun turret is just good for cheap damage in the start of the game.) or can give turrets more use like having the concussion turret destroy shields, but other upgrades are just worthless like having the gun turret with it's weak damage target higher health enemies when it's much better suited to picking off the weak enemies.\n\nThere's no way, aside from the ability, to aid in resource gain, it's really slow and makes it so you spend most of your time hovering over the build/upgrade buttons waiting for the last few points to tick in so you can push it. Though even with the lack of money to build things we were finding that the game was ending with us not even utilizing half the board on some levels so it feels like you don't have enough resource AND you don't have much use for it. It's pretty odd.\n\n\nAll in all the game was pretty disappointing, and unlike most games which can easily make things better with friends this coop is forced and it means even playing with another person it'll be pretty easy to find playing this boring. It has no replayability as none of the levels are exciting enough to justify trying to do them better than you did the first time. Lastly the score system must be for some people who like watching a number go up because I couldn't care less if I even made it to bronze.","July 11, 2015","false","9.8"," 57 of 74 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","57","74","0","3"

Unfortunately, the guys who made it did such a shoddy job that the rankings were rendered worthless almost instantly as it was so brazenly easy to cheat, thus undoing everyone's hard work.\nUnfortunately, the same level of bad design and poor decisions is apparent in the sequel, though this time, what rankles is the interface and "the feel" of the game.  Controls are far more clunky than first time round, with far too much consideration being given to controllers over mouse and keyboard, and the graphics, whilst more detailed, somehow manage to look worse than the first game.  A few additions have been made to the game, including boost blocks for your towers to stand on and alternative commanders that can loan additional powers to either you or your towers, but it all feels tacked on and lacklustre, while the main game seems forgotten.\nMaps are poorly designed and only really have one way of being handled, so the entire system of repetitive play to discover the optimal mazes and paths is rendered moot.\nAll in all, I just cannot recommend it.

Well, have more of the same, only tweaked and given a big ol' graphics overhaul (not that the original wasn't pretty)  and a bunch of little features that at best are nothing but fun, and at worst can be ignored.  The writing and voice acting is still there so plenty of delightful exposition about raspberries.\n\nPerhaps the best new feature is that levels are no longer static.  Almost every level can be "edited" in pre-determined ways by clicking on the command ship and paying a few resources to add sections to the map.  Some sections add new areas to maze the aliens, others add new build locations to cover previously vulnerable areas.  Of course, after adding this feature it is never really mentioned in the story line so you have to figure out the feature even exists on your own.\n\nAir enemies/flight lanes were taken out, but they didn't really add anything to the game since a single level 3 missile tower would trivialize any flight path it could reach.  So now the Missile Tower is a long-range single-target bombardment tower (with the Meteor adding AOE/DOT bombardment).\n\nThe only feature I don't wholly like is the tower upgrade system.  You can slot upgrades into your towers, upgrades which have some interesting effects (scatter shot to give AOE on gun towers, slow lasers, etc.).  The real problem is that the upgrades are randomly gifted after every completed mission (story or not) with no control over what you get.  This is exacerbated by the fact that almost every upgrade has multiple levels.  So you can be "find" level 1 shield busting concussion bombs, or you can find level 3 despite not having any previous versions of the item.  the only redeeming feature of the "drop" system is that it won't give you items you already have, or have a higher level of.\n\nOver all, and despite the brain-dead drop system, this game is over all a massive improvement and great sequal for the original Defnse Grid.  Don't let my winging about the drop system turn you off of a great purchase.","September 23, 2014","true","15.7"," 47 of 70 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","47","70","0","3"

I'm OK with listening to them the 1st, 2nd or even 3rd time, but when I'm banging my head against the proverbial wall, I finally just gave up & put my headphones on my desk instead of listening to them while I'm trying Level 12 incursion for the 14th time.\n\nNow that I have THAT out of the way, this game is just simply unbelievably awesome.\n\nSome people will say "why on earth would I want to pay $24 for a TD game?"\n\nThis game has so much variety, it extends the gameplay 20x over a simple playthrough. While it does this through game variants like frozen core, or grinder and a handful of others, it has several different difficulties ranging from easy, normal, hard & elite. Then compound that with competitive, or competitive sell and I don't even want to do the math to say how many different ways you can play this game.\n\nThen you have the entirely new tower upgrade system which will give you another 10-30 different powers PER TOWER to enhance tower abilities. These tower upgrades drop every time you complete a round and really change the landscape, literally. Where gun towers are uniformly weak on the first few levels, after you've completed the game, you're going to have some unreal deadly gun towers with abilities like ignore shields, or shield busters. Likewise with laser, target strongest enemy is a huge boost to not only survival but score as well.\n\nEach of these tower upgrades come in levels, so the first level might not seem that big but when you've got an Inferno that lights everything on fire & anything they in turn touch will cause others to get lit with 20% damage, you know you've got something special.\n\nThis skill enhancement can make a level that was really tough the first time around, something really enjoyable the 2nd time around as you're able to contemplate entirely new strategies for how to employ an array of towers.\n\nAs you get the score boost ability, thinking of how to soften everything up so that they fall into your kill zone (where you want 2 or even 3 score boost towers as their sphere of influence is rather small) to maximize your score can change with every iteration as you get new gun upgrades or obtain new special AI abilities. Because score is tied to resources, if you can avoid using one of the special weapons to kill things, you can employ the resource generator to give you even more resources to maximize score.\n\nYes, you heard me, special weapons. Where before in DG1 you had the laser that you could employ, in DG2 you have about 8 special weapons (one for each AI in the campaign) so you can pick and choose and see which one fits your play-style.\n\nThe ability to use your WASD keys to move around & look at things from different angles is a nice touch. As is the toggle "F" to fast forward (in DG1, you had to hold that sucker down all the time).\n\nI'm really looking forward to the creativity of people who create & sell levels using the free DG Architect. This will extend the game for a long time. Want some new variety? Visit the store! While I think the current pricing is a bit steep at $1.99 per level (I think $0.99 would be better), remember, you're not just buying one new level, you're buying about 20 with all the variants listed above.\n\nThis game is phenomenal. I'll be putting a lot more hours into this!

I could not get enough of the original and enjoyed the core game and all the add-ons as well. I loved the gameplay, graphics, story and voiceovers.\n\nThe new version falls short in every category. Why the developer chose to rebuild the game from the ground up is beyond me. The most disappointing aspect is the cheesy Candy Crush graphics. The graphics in the original were clean and crisp. You could make out the details of the aliens even when you were zoomed out – and they looked cool. Not so with DG2. Unless you are zoomed all the way in you can’t see much of the aliens outside of their healthbar. What is there is translucent and muddy. And the colors…..yuck. The towers looks like cheap plastic toys. The animation is cartoonish at best. I miss the cool looking meteor trails in the original not to mention the meteors themselves you could see when you zoomed in. Whether you zoom in or out, the graphics are a bitter disappointment.\n\nThe gameplay is decent enough, although choppy and sluggish at times. I don’t know that I will make it to the end.

I LOVE great tower defense games, but I generally like tower defense games. They are great to play while you eat food, download music, or generally aren't in a mood to be hardcore.\n\nWith that said, I cannot recomment DG2 to tower defense likers or lovers. The price for the game is entirely too high, and the range of tower types and the interactions between towers are too few. I played Starcraft 1 custom maps with more depth than DG2. And I paid less for Starcraft 1. Crap.\n\nI'll be honest, I expected a pretty high quality TD for what DG2 charges. The story mode is cool and all, but for about 8-10 hours of gameplay (no speedup either), it really doesn't justify the price.\n\nAgain, to re-iterate, the towers in this game have no cool interactions. There are no tower A buffs tower B effects, there are no 2 of this tower type adjacent to each other gets a neat bonus, and there is really no reason to buy this game. It has but the most basic of tower types (shoot fast, low damage OR shoot slow, high damage... whee), and the temporal tower is the ONLY effect tower, with an almighty and predictable slow effect.\n\nI will note that each tower has some special abilities you can unlock and add to them. However, from the ~ 2/4 I unlocked on each tower, they tend to be "Deal more damage to shielded enemies", or "Target Priority: Strongest". They could at least have made it "Target Priority: Smartest", so it would at least be usable.\n\nSave the money, go buy yourself WC3: TFT or SC2, and just play custom mapped tower defense there.

Having said that, I'm glad I have. This review is taking a look at the game as it is, since I hadn't heard of Defense Grid until now and I have spent approximately 40 minutes in game at the time of writing.\n\nHere are a few things I picked up on which I are of reasonable quality for tower defense games:\n- Pathing. Yes I know that most tower defense games include pathing for strategy but this always ticks a huge box for me. Something else which was a pleasant surprise was that one of the beta levels initially started with a smaller map and it grew. I'm not sure whether or not this is new but it certainly changed the way I could think (as the initial area was tiny).\n\n- Towers. Look, with tower defense games you're always going to be seeing the same things, but that's okay. There's always going to be how each game balances towers in terms of cost and effectiveness. I like the towers presented in DG2, however I do believe they seem a little bit stale in regards to how similar they all appear.\n\n- Buff towers (I already forgot what they're called so I'm going to call them this). I'm sure most/all tower defense games have a tower that perform some sort of powerup to towers around it, but the way DG2 does this actually adds yet more strategy. The way DG2 does it, is that your buff tower is the cheapest tower you can build. Why might you ask? Well that's because initially it acts as an obstructor, something that can help you build your path. After you have enough resource for the tower you want to powerup, you place it on top of the buff tower and you can pay an extra 200 resource to improve the tower that's on top. Personally speaking, it's a nice touch and allows you to build more natural paths, rather than a cluster of towers next to eachother.\n\n- Health (Cores). Nice touch with how the enemies have to take all your cores, however the fact they also have to walk back makes this relatively easy (at least on story/open/normal. I haven't had time to look at other modes yet which I'm sure are going to be a blast. Then again this is probably just me nitpicking at stuff I haven't had a proper look at), but I digress. I like how different enemies can carry a certain amount of cores (although so far without paying too much attention only the big guys carry more than 1). I certainly think this is an interesting thing and hopefully there's the possibility of an enemy that can carry a lot of cores!\n\n- Enemies. I thought the enemies at the start were fairly standard (fast enemies, grouped enemies, large/slow/painintheass), however upon right clicking upon one (that's how you view their stats) I noticed the abstract text went more into detail about their movement, with one type of enemy being slower around corners. I found this interesting because again it makes you think about optimal pathing.\n\nSo my conclusion is this. It's a great game for what's already available and it has the potential to be something amazing for the tower defense genre. Whilst graphics aren't necessarily important for tower defense games, DG2 looks pretty, although I do wish it had anti-aliasing support. For a beta it works well, and if you go in expecting something more polished than a beta release, then you'll be disappointed, however if you can look past that and see the potential then this one is certainly a keeper and one you'll enjoy when the full release comes around.","July 23, 2014","true","28.7"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","19","26","0","2"

But after playing some, DG2 did wrong what DG1 did right.\n\nI am a DG(1) player since the beginning, I also ranked very high in DG1 scores and with this said - I chose the path to (score) competition in DG. My review of DG2 is mostly based on the following setting: competition, hard.\n\nPros:\n+ many game modes\n+ towers seem balanced\n\nCons:\n- intransparent scoring\n- to much abusive potential on any other mode than "competition"\n- simple, imbalanced alien waves\n- no replay value\n\nNeutral:\n- many different configuration tweaks for towers\n- different "orbital lasers"\n- boost tower boosts\n\n\nRanking:\nThe best option to generate score is the dulling doing of "gather aliens", "herd" them by building and selling towers and use the orbital resource laser. In normal game mode, there is no reward for an excelent tower placement! The score is given for abusing the whole game principle.\nOf course there is a "competition" mode, in which selling tower is prohibited and this exploid isn't possible. So yes, you can play the game on a competetive level, but there aren't much others doing the same. The ranking in competition - hard counts areound 50 people at all; for comparisson, normal - normal there are round about 18k+.\n\nWith the new scoring and the new game modes, DG2 has become a casual gamers game. There are a lot of upgrades, some choices in the starting setup and a waste amount of game modes. So in conclusion, it is more of a "DG1s" except the changed scoring.\n\nWaves:\nMany levels staring with regulat swarm aliens and the only difficult is, to kill the few "big ones".\nWithin the waves there will be some fast or very tough enemies - even if your defense line worked highly efficient till this time, you'll have to adapt it only for these some aliens! It is doable without a doubt, but at least for me it feels just a bit anyoing.\n\nConclusion:\nAt least for me, there is no motivation in game modes beside "competition". I miss a gamemode with the extras but without the ability to sell towers. So it is DG1 with the lack of the (score relevant) orbital laser.\nAlso I dislike the scoring system. The scoring system of DG1 added a strategic depht, which DG2 hasn't. (As I could see in the forums, some didn't got the whole effect of the DG1 scoring system - these are mostly the ones which like the new one in DG2)\n\nPrice:\nAs I am writing this review, the price is 22.99€ - even if I paid more for the alpha, I can't reccomend this price tag. For better value get DG1 with the expansion packs. I think that somewhat <11€ would reflect the value of this game - because it is such an eye candy for a TD game.","January 12, 2015","false","40.7"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

Gameplay is really the key to this game. The flow will be different (in some ways) to DG1, But the feel and the basic gameplay will still be there.  There are a large number of additions and enhancements.  But you can take or leave those. the game is the thing, and that looks to be as good, if slightly different, to the first.\n\nIf I were asked, "is it worth the money?" the answer has got to be "Yes, absolutely!". You will get DG1 for free with the pre-order (not sure about after that) which in itself is incredible value.  I think I paid $5 on a steam sale, and have racked up 600 hrs on this game just in casual play.\n\nIf you are into strategy at all, (and maybe don't get free time in chuncks much larger than 30-45 mins - being a parent will do that to you), then this is the game for you.  It is really brilliant, challenging, yet not overwhelming, with a decent learning curve, and interesting yet not intrusive story.  You can play a level in 20 mins (or less sometimes) or you can stick with it for hours. It is a fun game you can lose yourself in quite easily.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/recommended/221540/","FlamesSuperior","UpInFlames","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/","263 products in account","It’s amazing to think that it’s been six years since Hidden Path released the acclaimed Defense Grid: The Awakening, often cited as one of the defining tower defense games. For the sequel, Hidden Path took to Kickstarter and with overwhelming support the game became a reality. And the reality is that Defense Grid 2 is just as good as the original, totally nailing the strategic and addictive elements that are so crucial for any tower defense game. Unfortunately, the reality is also that Defense Grid 2 is basically identical to its predecessor which is definitely mildly disappointing.\n\nIf you ever played a tower defense game, you’ll be right at home here. If not, the short but clear tutorial will get you up to speed. Basically, you have to defend your base and stop aliens taking your cores by building towers with various abilities. For example, Inferno towers set groups of aliens aflame at close range, Temporal towers slow them down whereas Missile towers deal massive damage at long range. All tower types serve a specific purpose and you will make good use of them all in order to defend each map. Just like the towers, the aliens as well come in different forms. Some are large and slow, some are small but fast, some have stealth, others regenerate or spawn other aliens. Naturally, enemy variety is crucial in order to ensure each tower type is useful. Sometimes the paths the aliens take will be set, other times you will have the option to block certain routes carving out the longest and most winding path you possibly can in order to ensure maximum tower usage. The map design is nothing short of fantastic walking a fine line between intentional design and player experimentation.\n\nDefense Grid 2 looks and sounds great. Each tower is distinct and easily recognizable which becomes extremely important in later rounds. Sometimes you’ll have a bit of time to just observe the glorious carnage unfold before you. Most of the time, however, you will be scrambling to make important but quick decisions. Every wave will pose a different threat and you don’t have much time to assess what is the best move. You also have limited resources which you earn as you clear each wave. This is where Defense Grid 2 truly shines. It seems so effortless and yet so many tower defense games fail on this tactical level. It’s truly a fast-paced, action-packed strategy game.\n\nBy far the worst aspect of the game is the storytelling. The original was light on narrative, you only had a single AI advisor which had something to say from time to time about the current happenings. This time, you have six or seven badly written and acted AIs who love to yammer on about whatever is going on and even beyond that. It quickly gets really annoying and detracts from the overall experience.\n\nEven though I am a bit disappointed by the lack of new towers and new ideas and the awful, intrusive storytelling, the truth is that Defense Grid 2 is a very good game and an easy recommendation to anyone who is remotely interested in tower defense games.\n\n7 OUT OF 10 (GOOD)","December 5, 2014","true","16.6"," 22 of 36 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","22","36","0","0"

The graphics and appearances of things in the game are rather nice to look at, and the game doesn't lag a single bit, even if every tower spot is filled with towers and literally the whole screen is just almost nothing but towers.\nThe gameplay however is awesome, with alot of other Tower Defense games in mind.\n\nUpgrading towers is simple and straightforward, and no single tower is the be-all or end-all to any map. You can even use a single tower for most maps and beat it.\n\nThe game is very simple in difficulty aswell. Easy is actually Easy, Normal is what Normal usually should be, Hard is actualy hard, and Elite is as hard as any after-Hard difficulty.\n\nThe camera is controlled by the mouse, with the cursor locked at the center, and the cursor on any in-game menu before the end level screen is locked to go up or down a certain amount, preventing you from accidentally clicking elsewhere.\n\nHonestly I love this game, I just simply love it.\n\nOverrall, I give this game a 9/10, It's jsut nothing but a pleasure to play. If you like strategy, tower defense or wave-based games then pick this up.\n\nThe only things I don't like, is how the menu of modes don't display medals which are earned, though that may be how I've only played on Easy, and thye only appear on the menu itself on Normal. The game also doesn't have a pause feature, though I imagine that might detract from the game somehow.","September 25, 2014","true","23.5"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

I wish I had read negative ones before buying (I only did positive ones) and even if i did, truth be told, I wouldn't believe them. Screenshots look amazing and DG1 was amazing - so - how can it be bad?\n\nWell, truth is, all the negative posters are right. Game is a huge dissapointment.\n\nI am a fan of DG1 and simply LOVE it and there isn't a negative thing I can say about it; I particularly love the interest and scoring system and I try to be top 1% on all missions. So from tactical / strategic point, I am "demanding costumer".\n\nNow to DG2:\n- menus and GUI are plain horrible (try it and see it)\n- resources raise at 10/tick, regardless if you have 0 or 5000 - what's up with interest and its tactical value? (here I have to say, maybe i haven't played long enough to get to that point and it is in game later on, but not at beginning (it was in DG1))\n- graphics: its really ugly. Screenshots were beautiful, game itself is not. It makes you believe screenshots are art-concepts and not from within actual game, cuz those few colorful pixels moving around on your screen are far from what screenshots advertise. Further, the game itself feels "wrong". I don't know how to explain better, but movement of towers building, of towers upgrading is just "cheap". DG1 had it done superbly, each upgrade of tower took exactly the same amount of time and you knew exactly when it will collapse and come back up as stronger version. I don't doubt that timing-wise here it's the same, but the way it is animated? It feels cheap and wrong.\n\nHaving said that I played 3 missions, scored 3 golden medals and what I am still wondering about (after I closed the game as I had enough of dissapointment) is - how I could NOT get them, since i killed all aliens and kept all cores. Where is the difference between my score and score of other players if all aliens are killed, game lasted same duration (all waves) and we got same amount of "resource ticks". Where does the difference appear?\n\nAnd even positive posters wrote about stupid secondary tower abilities upgrade system and getting mk2 type abilities over mk1 in total random fashion.\n\nAll in all what I grasped in 36 minutes of playing is that this game appears to be colorful cluster♥♥♥♥ of pixels made for 10 years olds who get sick of repetitive stuff and challenges in 10 minutes, having lots of extra abilities compared to dg1 (secondary tower abilities, colorful-yet-ugly tower animations and circles and generals to help with) and it has absolutely none of old DG1 charm.\n\nI'm going back to DG1...","September 27, 2014","false","0.7"," 42 of 75 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","42","75","0","0"

The system of weapon upgrades is also somewhat unclear, and tower increases seem to come at random times, which can be frsutrating when reaching the last chapters and needing real fire power.\n\nOverall a great choice for those who want some old fashioned tower defense action and really aren't interested in much of a story or a deep dive in weapon vs. alilen strategy.","May 6","true","89.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Judging from the beta, Defense grid 2 so far looks like excellent sequel and successor to the throne. All the core elements are in place - hordes of aliens trying to steal your power cores, familiar defense towers and some new ones, great voice actor (raspberries!) and varied landscapes to defend. Completely new is the possibility to shape the playing field by optionally adding or moving certain segments of terrain which gives us new options to route the aliens, create the perfect killing zones and will result in more varied personal strategies.\n\nGraphics are excellent and improved to today's standards but some beta players (including me) feel they are a bit too colourful and shiny and overwhelming at times. Developers have responded to the feedback on beta forums and we'll see if there is a change or an option for a more "realistic" look.\n\nI'm very much looking forward to the final release of D♥♥♥♥nd I recommend to all tower defence lovers to put this game on their wishlist!","August 16, 2014","true","8.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

A balanced TD game requires the player to think the type, order, timing, and the location of tower placement rather than just following formulas.  Finding the correct answer to the puzzle provided by the map is the fun part.  This means each tower must be unique and have its own role, which DG does well.  The crystal stealing and retrieval system adds more depth as usual, since you need to think about the order of the towers on the way back.\n\nAll this is wasted with a clumsy UI where it's easy to make mistakes or it takes time to perform actions.  DG utilizes mouse and keyboard shortcuts  (both can be used for camera pan) and intuitive indictars to show what's going on at all times.  It doesn't beat Defender's Quest's unit key assignments but it's the best out of 3D TD games I've ever played.  Being able to rewind a botched level without cost saves time so it works well as a casual game to play during a limited amount o ftime, instead of forcing players to replay the whole level.  (So many TD games these day take 20 minutes to go through a level, only to fail at the last wave)\n\nDG2 has more content, refinment, and expandability compared to DG1, so it's definitely worth it for DG1 fans, or for those that want a solid TD game and haven't played DG1.  If you've played DG1 and didn't like it, then DG2 won't make you happy either.  For those who like "RPG elements" (aka leveling and loot), I'd recommend Defender's Quest and Prime World Defenders.","September 25, 2014","true","5.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The second opus features almost the same towers, with a twist: you now can build them on top of Boost towers, and activate a special effect on them: Disrupt shields, Overcharge towers or Boost score - your choice.\n\nOn top of that, you'll meet new AI on each mission, and pick one of them to support your efforts. Each AI provides you with an advantage that can be triggered and requires some time to be ready again: the classical strike from above, more resources to spend, overcharging a group of towers... - your choice again.\n\nAnd if you think that would be enough, think again. Not only the towers can be upgraded from level 1 (green) to level 3 (red); but you now can tweak each of them with nice improvements like: revealing hidden enemies, damaging over time, focusing on the biggest enemy ... - your choice !\n\nTo keep the pressure on, the clock of each mission starts without waiting for you to analyse the layout. So you'll have to think fast and fail a lot before you nail the level and reach higher scores. Luckily, you can go back to the previous checkpoint and readjust your strategy (there are more checkpoints so you don't feel like being forced to restart entirely a level).\n\n~ And now some tips and tricks (don't read them until you hit a wall of difficulty)\n\nFirst, the levels can have the same entry / exit point; or a different entry and exit points. Some maps have multiple entries and exit points and can be tricky!\n\nSecond, the levels can be roads surrounded by tower locations, or made of large chunks for concrete where you'll have to build a path to channel the aliens.\n\nEven if it is possible to fill a level with level 1 towers and still win, ultimately, you'll want to concentrate devastation on carefully selected spots where the aliens will walk multiple times.\n\nSo, what are the best / worst towers in the game ? On my own, I mostly play using Concussion, Temporal, Laser, Machinegun and Cannon. Sometimes Missile. The Concussion is so powerful you'll eventually forget the Inferno, the Tesla and the Meteor. It's a shame but you're not here to concede anything.\n\nNext questions are: where should you place the towers, how should you combine them, and what are the best boost to give them. Here are my suggestions.\n\nFirst, in each level, locate the entry & exit points. Then assess if you can change the path of not. If you cannot change the path, locate where you have bottlenecks and paths that can be targeted twice (or more) with a single tower. Usually, the Core Center is one of them.\n\nOnce you've located or created these bottlenecks, decide where are the best spots to concentrate damage. Sometimes it's at the very beginning of the level, sometimes close to the Core Center, sometimes somewhere else.\n\nThen:\n- Build a Concussion (on a boost if you can channel the aliens, or benefit from back-and-forth; and on land if you cannot change the path) then at least a second one close to the first so you can combine the effects). A good boost is Overcharge or Score Boost if you aim for the top of the Ladder :)\n- Right after the Concussion, build a Laser that will continue to burn the aliens. A good boost is Overcharge - unless these are far from the Temporal so Disrupt is a better choice (laser don't go through shields)\n- Build a Temporal close to the Concussion towers to slow down the fastest aliens and nicely melt the other ones. A good boost is Disrupt, to remove those nasty shields. (And when I say " melt" I literally mean "melt").\n- Build Machinegun(s) near the "entry" of your Concussion / Temporal / Laser combination. A good boost is Overcharge unless there aren't close to a Temporal with Disrupt ; then Disrupt is a better choice.\n- Build Cannon(s) to cover either or both the entry and exit of your Concussion / Temporal / Laser combination. A good boost is Overcharge.\n- Make sure Cannon(s) or Machinegun(s) are protecting the Core Center. A temporal can help too.\n- Build Missile(s) to cover the Core Center, Kill zones and especially exits - you don't want one remaining alien on the brink of death getting away with your precious cores :) No sir, you don't!\n\nAbout the "tweaks" in the towers, here you enter the realm of preferences. Usually I use "Focus on biggest target" on Machinegun, Cannon, Laser and Missile since the Concussion will usually get rid of the tiny swarms. On Temporal I try to boost the slowing down effect. On the Concussion I try to raise the damage.\n\nBut once you're acquainted will the levels, feel free to experiment! You may choose to tweak you towers to slows down the aliens as much as possible, or to damage them overtime, or pierce their shields. (Now this game sounds like your regular ARPG, doesn'it it?)\n\nHave fun!","August 14, 2015","true","62.2"," 20 of 34 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","20","34","2","0"

The game mechanics were already solid, so rather than changing them the developer added more depth to them.\n\nYou can now build a booster tower platform on the ground, on which you can place the real tower. This booster can act like a cheap wall when you don't put anything on top of it. With a tower, the booster can be upgraded to increase the tower's damage, to disrupt shields and show cloaked enemies, or to increase how many points you get from enemies killed next to it.\n\nThe orbital laser is now a power granted by your AI general. You can pick from a number of different generals to change the power to something else, such as boosting the effectiveness of your towers or getting extra resources.\n\nIn the "You monster" DLC of the first game, GlaDOS would occasionally change something about the level, such as raising or lowering sections. In DG2 you can buy/order some of these changes from your command tower. Getting access to an extra tower in a critical location can turn the game for you.\n\nThe difficulty ramps up over the course of the campaign. In the first 6 levels I was able to get a gold medal on normal difficulty without putting any real effort into it. Build a strong defense, then the last 3-5 waves don't build anything to rake in the points needed to get a gold medal. At no point were my cores in danger of getting stolen.\n\nThen I got to level 7, where there were two independent lanes to defend. It was brutal. The first 13 waves were reasonably easy to do without losing cores. Then I lost my first core. Rewind a few levels, try a different strategy. The cores remained safe. Then around level 18 the boss monsters started coming in, and group cloakers, and group shielders. In the end I managed to keep all my cores by rewinding whenever I lost one, but it took two hours and only netted a silver medal. Next up was level 8 and it was just as challenging, and once again I had to settle for silver.\n\nThis game offers a very good challenge if you don't want to settle for anything less than gold.","September 27, 2014","true","7.8"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

A Disappointing Sequel On Multiple Levels.Genre: Single Player & Multiplayer Narrative Driven Tower Defense.\nDeveloped and Published by: Hidden Path Games & 505 Games\nPlatform: Windows, MacOSX and Linux\nBusiness Model: Base Game + Community Created Levels Sold in DG2's Store.\nOne of the Backers of their Kickstarter Preamble\nI was one of the original backers on Kickstarter and gave $20 to help get this game published. I did this because Defense Grid The Awakening had been one of my favorite tower defense games and the developers had a solid track record of games up till then. Unfortunately, the Kickstarter was fraught with funding problems and the game we have gotten since is, in my opinion, a pale shadow of what this series used to be. So, let’s talk about Defense Grid 2.\n\nStory Thoughts\nThe main campaign story…..ergh….well, let’s talk about it. One: The humor is based on the AIs saying whacky things, but it gets tiresome as the campaign goes on. It’s not that well written, especially when you have the next problem. Two, its got way too many characters. Listening to so many AIs chatter on as you try to setup towers can multiply how tiresome the bad dialogue gets. Three: It’s trying to have a serious story undertone while all this “wackiness” is going on. Which causes the game to fail at pulling both tones off. Fourth and final: the voice acting is cringe-worthy. You’ll recognize at least a few of the voice-actors if you have watched certain sci-fi series in the past five years. Their performances range from barely adequate to cringe-worthy overacting, despite General Fletcher from the original game still bringing his a-game.\n\nPC Optimization\nOne of the biggest aggravations I had with this game the entire time is the optimization. It’s awful. It’ll drop to 50-55FPS with just a few aliens on the screen. Add in a lot of special effects from the towers and a whole horde of aliens and it will tank down to 20-30FPS. I thought I even noticed it go to 10FPS at some points. That is simply unacceptable for any game to have that poor a performance level, even if we ignore how ludicrous it is for a tower defense game to lag this badly. The performance doesn't improve even if you set the game to its lowest quality. The game’s FPS drops just as hard regardless. I did contact the devs about the problem but they never got back to me. I’m not happy about that lack of communication. (At the time of this review, I have a quad-core CPU and a Nvidia 660ti. My computer should NOT be the problem here.)\n\nPC Settings and UI\nThe graphic settings menu is worse than the game’s optimization. All you will find is a quality slider, resolution options and V-Sync, that’s all it has. Not having tweakable settings really bothers me. Anti-Aliasing is completely missing and so is Anisotropic Filtering by the looks of it. Both of which would have really made the game look better. I have no idea how it could have shipped without even AA in the quality slider. At least the audio settings menu is very competent, with plenty of sliders to let you change the level of music, effects, and how often the AI will talk. (I would set the frequency to its lowest.) Even the keys can be rebound on keyboard and mouse and controllers. So, to see such a lacking graphics option menu is really bizarre because everything else you would need/want is here. There are a multitude of subtle bugs such as the Temporal Tower not slowing aliens or dots not affecting aliens but nothing game breaking as far as I encountered.\n\nI’ll give the game some credit, it gives you a lot more information up front and in-game with line graphs and heat-mapping to show how and what you’re doing. The UI at least feels more functional in most cases, even if I dislike how the menus are handled.\n\nGraphics\nBut there is one thing that really gets me and that’s how indistinct all the towers and aliens are. The animations are incredibly simple, the towers are difficult to tell apart and the sound assets are really weak. Gone is the epic rain of fire(s) from your meteor towers, the loud report of the cannon towers blasting aliens away and the mini-explosions from concussion towers. Instead, all you can hear is bullets from gun towers, the occasional laser being spat out and that’s about it. All of which looks & sounds really unimpressive. Sure, you can hear the rest of the towers if you really strain your hearing, but that’s not the point. It lacks distinctness. All the towers just melt together to disappointing results. Then there’s the tower upgrades, I hate the new system which has you building towers on platforms and then selecting an anti-shield upgrade, a power upgrade or a score-increase upgrade. It feels overly complicated and unnecessary compared to how DG1 handled it with the command tower. The alien designs are much worse and have the same basic problems as the towers do. They have less character and feel indistinct as you slaughter 1,000s of them per level. You only notice the different speeds each one moves at. For a game on a new engine, this leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nIndividual Level Design\nI’m not inspired by the level design at display here. Graphically, they are just ok. A few of the levels they showed off at PAX and other big public events were the best they had. Only one or two others were a bit different from the norm, Checks and Balances, which comes really late in the campaign, has a unique gauntlet run with six different lanes to stop. Another is Split Decision that has you defending two core stations, though the difficulty spike in this level is unreal. I was really hoping they would go all the way with this new feature they had announced a long while ago that has different parts of the level opening up as the level progressed. I had hoped this would require us to change tactics on the fly but it really doesn't. Its relegated to a few levels and doesn't really do much more than extend the maze you've built up. But here's my main issue. Each level feels aimed at having only one way of accomplishing it and you have to stick to that one goal, otherwise you'll fail.\n\nWorkshop Anti-Support\nWorkshop support for this game is abysmal. Basically, level makers have to get their maps upvoted by the community and then approved by Hidden Path Entertainment to be sold. Yes, that's right. Sold. Sold on the in-game store. While they say that royalty will be paid out to the level makers, I have to wonder how much. It's little wonder that this game only has 16 items at the moment. The way that the Workshop support currently works strikes me as greedy. There hasn't been any DLC made for the game yet but why bother when you can just sell what other people make. It's....disgusting.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThe more I play Defense Grid 2, the more I loathe everything about it. Getting through the main campaign of around 10 hours was a chore unto itself. I got to the point that I set it to easy just so I could see the ending, which wasn’t worth it. I didn’t try multiplayer, I didn’t try the different modes for each level, I didn’t give Steam Workshop a go, I didn’t do anything besides the main campaign because by the time I finished the main campaign, I was done.

You can just buy this new iteration of Defense Grid 2.\n\nFor those who want some more information; heres my (although little) review.\n\nWith the obvious graphic update, this game gives a new update to the concept that were made in the prequel. The gameplay and feel of the game is all in all the same as the predecesser. And thats a good thing. Because many developers would build up its sequel in so way that it easily differate from its prequel. But here; the developers has made a clear choice in keeping it so close to the original as possible.\n\nNow, off course, the concept here is pure tower defence. And how much can you differ from it without becoming something else. Well, this game has certain new features that will make it fun for us tower defense geeks.\n\nMore choices for every tower, whereby you now can choose certain skills for them as the game goes on. You can now also use more then the original shot from outer space, you have several different "shots" with various powers to choose from.\n\nOverallt this is a great contribution, although some would say its probably more like a Defense Grid 1,5, due to its visual update. But with its better balance and pure gameplay, makes this a great game for mostly anybody.\n\n\nAdd to this, the new feature of multiplayer. Either Coop or play against, you can now play with your friends, by sharing the level.\n\nThis along side with all the different modes make this game a great contribution to the Tower Defence genre.\n\n\nAll in all, a must buy if you like strategy/tower defence :D","September 24, 2014","true","67.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

I played the daylights out of the first one, getting gold medals in all but 5 or 6 of the "extra" missions and putting way more than 125 hours into it. At first I wasn't too heavily into this game. It's different in its own right yet it has a similar theme. The addition of boost towers, boosted abilities and tower modifiers adds a different element to the game that I allowed myself to become overwhelmed with (min/max theorycrafting). At first I let it take away from the game but then I realized that while these augments made aspects of the game easier, they weren't required.\n\nI am on the last round of missions and the game has really grown on me. I appreciate its simplicity and yet the depth of options and replay value. It's a game I can sit down and play a single map or I can play for hours if I choose. Most of the levels are well designed and have enough vareity that I can tackle the alien problems in different ways. There is some easy levels and there are some brutal levels giving me a vareity of play experiences from the joyful to the ultra frustrated (and then elated when you figure it out).\n\nIf you like TD games, this is a no-brainer.

For someone that never got to play the original the story doesn't really make sense. There is no recap or refresher as to what happened in the first game but if all you care about is the killing then...well you don't care. Furthering the story issues the dialog pacing is terrible. Voice acting is decent and the writing fair, it's just lines aren't triggered fluently and often times the story dialog takes place at terrible times leaving you missing things or unless you adjust the volumes the sounds of hundreds dying drowns things out.\n\nVarious other things also don't feel fully fleshed out like tower info and upgrade details. Rules about vertical planes and how it affects a given towers range and ability to fight are not explained. Line of sight issues, some times the specials you get from commanders do not work other than to show the visuals, play the sounds and incur the cool down, but the actual effect is no where to be found.\n\nMy primary complaint is the aforementioned feeling this is only half a game. It's incredibly short and while fun it feels less compelling than some online / free flash tower defenses. If this game was $12 I'd say grab it but I don't quite feel it's worth the $25. This isn't to spark some large debate over development / production efforts against asking price but rather I think the game could have been presented in a much simpler way that would have required less development cost and time, less system resources for potential buyers, and an over all better experience. Next time maybe they could consider leaving out gimmicks like the zoom. There is nothing great looking about anything and zooming in doesn't help with anything. In fact it makes things very difficult. If you want amazing looking you play games like Crysis. The 3D modeling and effort put into this game just seems like a waste when they could have made something just as fun as a 2D top down game and spent their time and effort on $25 worth of game rather than bland 3D modeling.\n\nIn addition to the very short nature of this game I thought the level builder and community map making would give it more value and replay-ability but sadly with far too many games these days there is a catch. Basically this game is another micro transaction ♥♥♥♥♥. Community maps must be purchased meaning the replay value that might have given its price some worth is more like a lure to soak you for more cash. Frankly this makes me really mad. I thought I was buying a game, not a platform for them to sell me more ♥♥♥♥. It's like paying to have some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ salesman come into your home and try to tempt you to buy more ♥♥♥♥ all day. I get it, companies need to recoup costs, pay bills and their employees need to eat, but this has become a massive (and dishonest) practice in gaming these days. We used to buy triple A titles for say $60 but now you pay $60 and then they nickle and dime you until that $60 game is $300. Sure Defense Grid is $25ish, but to get more than a few hours play you have to start shelling out $2 a level with no real limit to how much you could end up spending. They also know psychologically it's easy to get someone to dump $2 300 times over a few months than to say upfront the game costs $250 or something else equally insane.\n\nFrankly my initial impression overlooked the story problems and I had fun until I realized nothing really made sense, there are still lots of problems, the game is incredibly short and the real dirty trick is they made the game off the backs of the fans, then they monetized the efforts of the fans creations for themselves too!","October 5, 2014","false","34.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Compared to the first Defense Grid, the graphics currenlty seem clunky, off center in places, and the towers seem unbalanced - some nowhere near the cost it takes to implement them. The AI is buggy (I could get all the aliens to spin in the same spot on 14- green towers only - even though they had a clear path), the game crashes, and the smooth, polished feel of the first DG is not currently present. Having said all that, it is BETA, and you takes your chances. While I can't imagine the developers fixing everything by Sep 23, the potential for a great game is there. So, given the binary choice between Yes and No for recommendation, I lean towards yes based on the developer's past success. But the real answer is, Wait And See...\n\n*** FINAL GAME ***\nIgnore every concern or reservation I had in the Beta and BUY THIS GAME!!! Now well polished and complete, Hidden Path delivered on every count.

As you play, certain stages have levels with open grids on them for tower placement. The creeps, those are the aliens trying to steal your cores and take them back, will alter their paths based on your tower placement.\n\nSo, there’s a strategy in placing towers in specific spots rather than just plopping each gun down and upgrading to win. Now, I don’t think Defense Grid was the first to do this, but I do think it does it exceptionally well. Each level that has these open layouts is much more interesting and challenging than others, and command centers on the levels will let you annex new regions in order to push out the length of the creeps’ path.\n\nYou’re not only playing with your budget in order to come up with the best defense power, but you’re trying to lay out towers and boost blocks (basically, a tower upgrade spot that brings better stats to your big guns later in each level) so that you can do the most damage on creeps during their runs.\n\nWhat’s frustrating about this game is that it’s impossible to have a planning phase. The levels start without you saying so, so you won’t be able to look at the map and decide which path is best before you start laying towers. Especially in the later game, the creeps move too fast and are far too strong for you to sit around and plan tower placement. I found this tough to contend with, especially since I’m the type of player who can’t play through tower defense games without getting perfect scores.\n\nI like the dynamic paths and forcing creep behavior, I just wish the game would give me an option to pause and look at the map before it steals all my cores and causes me to lose.  That’s probably just the perfectionist in me, though.\n","February 11, 2015","true","124.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

It alternates between stupid easy and stupid hard, usually based on map type. Some maps lets you build a tower maze, others don't. Some let you have a second crack at enemies as they try to escape with cores, others put their exit somewhere else. Some give you one avenue of attacks, others give you 2-4 enemy routes to defend against. And how difficult a given map is is entirely based on that.\n\nThe even more frustrating part is enemies don't seem consistent. Some maps start with a horde of weak enemies that die instantly. One map later just 2 or 3 of what appear to be the same enemies will rush through your defense unphased. Could be different enemies, but most of them look the same in this game. The artist chose coherent enemy aesthetics over making distinct enemy types easily recognizable. Their movement patterns are the most distinct thing about them and most enemies adhere to just 3 types of movement: The normal walking speed, the crawling speed, and the rusher.\n\nEven within the same map, difficulty randomly jumps. Some waves are easy, some are nearly impossible. You'll go half the game not letting a single enemy by then get a wave of shielded aliens that run right past your Tesla (shield-destroying) Towers without blinking even if you have 4 fully upgrades, damage-boosted of the Tesla Towers specifically for peeling shielded aliens of their shields at the start of the enemy path.\n\nLike the first game, DG2 survives on one thing: Tower Defense is a dead genre. There is no competition. If you really crave a TD game better than a poor flash clone it'll be worth the money. But not by much.","March 8, 2015","false","12.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

In my opinion though, it is a worthy sequel - essentially the same old balance and mix of towers and aliens pretty much that made DG1 work so well, but with a few neat twists and upgrades to make the experienced DG player think. All seems highly polished, and absolutely loving the Steam Friend performance trackers as well. The only small negative I'd note is that the towers all look a bit too much the same this time round, but that really is a very minor point that doesn't affect the new enhanced gameplay. Most telling I think, is that I don't think I'd ever go back to DG1 now, which is high praise indeed from me.

The only thing i wished for was more maps, probably some new towers.\n\nThen DG2 was announced and i was waiting for. Now i like it. Gameplay is fun and there are a lot of user maps now. Great.\n\nWhat i dislike: DG2 is suffering at the usual "it's made for consoles too" graphics (like so much other games using such a annoying graphics engine made for pc AND consoles). graphics are kinda "hissing" / "noising" (can't describe it better), even if AA and stuff are enabled. I really hate this at D♥♥♥♥nd it feels like being in old times a lot of years ago, when AA and AF wasn't available.\n\nCompared with DG1, this "pixel flickering" is ruining fun at D♥♥♥♥ bit. Also the UI (before maps are starting) is pretty clumsy, compared to DG1.\n\nBut: If you can deal with issues like this, you will like DG2 too. Well, at least as long you don't expect new stuff like new towers or similar.\n\nIf you like to create maps for DG2, you will love the map editor. ;)\n","May 15, 2015","true","15.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Defense Grid 2 is certainly an improvement on Defense Grid, and it brings a lot of fun things to the table. However, There are significant issues plaguing the game on all fronts.\n\nBugs render the game nearly unplayable in certain points. On a particular mission I found that building too many of one type of tower caused the game to crash consistently. Also, setting different resolutions using the launcher causes the game to behave strangely in different ways.\n\nThe voice acting and writing is hammy and unbelievable. When you had the one robot talking to you in the first game, it was pleasant and even kind of funny: he set the mood really well. Suddenly, in Defense Grid 2 there are multiple AIs all interacting with each other in strange ways, and it's never really explained where they all come from. Their interaction makes the obviously forced and childishly-written dialog painful to the ears. Kudos to the game for making them unavailable when they're indisposed in the story though.\n\nThe difficulties aren't calculated very well. Defense Grid was kind of hard! This game is pretty easy even when playing on hard difficulty. Honestly, the difficulty was what gave Defense Grid replay value, and after completing just the story mode in 2 I'm starting to get bored.\n\nAll this aside, the game is very pretty. It's graphically superior to it's predecessor and the levels are designed really well. The addition of the different superweapons, command shuttle allowing you to spend resources to modify the placement environment, and the modified towers and gameplay are all very well implemented. All of the changes are simultaneously intuitive and graceful.","August 14, 2015","true","22.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

I must say I had my doubts, before I saw it in action on my own screen. If you have or haven't experienced DG1, this is a must buy. Many things have changed for better or worse, but still more coud've been done. Graphics are pretty much the same, but explosions got a major bloom/flare treatment that would make J.Lo burn her A cup. Script and specially voice acting are top notch and often absolutely hilarious.\n\nThere are plenty of levels to explore, replay value with multiple game modes and difficulties. By the looks of it, we'll be getting more levels in near future made by community and developers. I just hate the fact that they ask money for average designs already. Only real problem that I complain is a dodgy difficulty. It is showing it's ugly face very clearly on competitive mode. There you won't be able to use AI bonus/tower perk tricks and even on normal you will run into a wall of W.T.F moments, a lot.\n\nOnce you are getting used to a single player content, there is an option for challenging multiplay, either co-op or against. Shame that there is no option for speeding up the game (co-op 24.9.14), so combat often feels like watching a paint dry. If you're playing with a random player, shared resources mean that a person with a faster metabolism steam rolls.\n\nDG2 has a lot of shells for a boomstick. Even that we are getting near perfection, I would've hoped for a little more tuning before release. Thinking about some sort of rpg elements and programmable towers? Those darn towers sometimes just shoot the wrong targets! Anyway, to me this is worth every penny and if you purchased DG2 in beta you got a pile of extra stuff.

(a previous reviewer said that the resource laser is the obviously best choice, I don't think they gave the other lasers a chance, and keep in mind each laser has a different cooldown).\n\n+while the voice acting is repetitive and silly, there are a lot of different lines, each tower has at least 5 descriptors (quite a few "on kill" voice overs, a couple that describe the tower as its being built)\n\nmehs:\n\nocassionally I get a *missing string* dialog box, I believe there is supposed to be dialog there.... or it could be pulling a Stanleys Parable on me, I'm not quite sure.\n\nis it as good as the original?

Given that I've played DG1 for years, on both the Xbox 360 and Steam with a total playtime of roughly 400 hours, I find the new look a bit odd.  It is shiny compared to the last game and it feels strange.  For a new player this would mean nothing, but there it is.  My biggest disappointment was in not realizing co-op did not mean local co-op.  Since I would play this locally on the couch, that is really very disappointing.  (Hint, Hint Hidden Path)  The user interface feels a little clunky in that it doesn't explain much about how the new base tower works.  It seems it adds bonus damage, but it is less than clear if it has an effect on non-attack towers.   I noticed that the zoom seems to not get as close as the first game did, which is a bit disappointing, but the zoom is not limited to just 3 positions which is good.  The fact that the levels change over time was a nice new mechanic, and much appreciated.  As for bugs, the only major one I saw in the 2 hours I played was that if I rewinded the game enough, the sound effects disappeared from the game completely.","July 19, 2014","true","165.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Every good thing you could say about the original can be applied to what I've played so far. The thing that sets the DG series apart from other tower defence games is the ncredibly fun and fair level design. You have a failsafe button, much like other tower defence games but it never feels like you have to use it. With strategic tower placement you should, in a good tower defence game, be able to win fairly.\n\nWhat I'm really excited to play around with is the malleable levels too. The one we're given access to here pulls it off incredibly well. You're given just enough space so that when the alien horde feels like it's about to overwhelm you an addition portion of the city rises out of the ocean just in time to save you. Great stuff.\n\nI'm intentionally not going to mention and graphics or sound because whilst all of those things are fine for now at its core Defence Grid is all about the gameplay and as I said, what we've got so far is stellar stuff. Get your money down and if you already have Defence Grid 1 and the 2nd tier goal is met, do someone a huge kindness and gift it to them.

There is always a debate in some communities if this game is "better" than the DG1.  For my money, DG2 is a fantastic game with more modes and better options than DG1.\n\nIf you aren't familiar with the Defense Grid 1 there is nothing wrong with picking up this one and then going back and playing DG1.  DG2 just feels more complete as a game.\n\nIn a few more words:\n\nThis is a tower defense game.  You, as the player (or commander as they call it) build various mechanisms (aka towers) to stop aliens from stealing your resources.  If you lose all your resources, game over.\n\nEach map typically has aliens march along predetermined paths in their never ceasing quest to steal your energy cores.  Along this path are build points in which the player erects towers of various designs (missiles, guns, lasers, etc) to eliminate the aliens and move on to the next map.\n\nThe goal is almost always to destroy all the aliens but the player is challenged to not only win, but build effciently in order to boost their score.  Towers can be upgraded and the player is awarded with bonuses and upgrades at various points in the game.\n\nThere are multiple modes outside of the main story campaign.  They typically involve some type of special challenge or limitation.\n\n\nThe bottom line:\nThis is a great game and its a nice way to kill time when you are bored with more traditional strategy games.  I highly recommend it for tower defense fans and first timers who are interested in something a little different.\n\nFinal Grade: B+","January 25, 2015","true","25.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game balance has been changed to reward educated experimentation over "trial-error-rollback-repeat," and it also feels like each map can be done well in more than one way. The continuous resource accumulation helps to eliminate some of the more punishing aspects of the first game. With tower-currency flowing in steadily, it's much more possible to recover from mistakes.\n\n"Defense Grid 2" certainly feels more expansive than its predecessor, with a larger number of tower pads to build on and a much more viable long-range game. I would even go so far as to say that a major key to the experience is getting strong use out of missile and meteor towers: You'll definitely want their ability to keep delivering damage over a large surface area.\n\nThe game's pacing has also been tweaked. "Defense Grid" sometimes felt ponderous, even if that ponderousness was also coupled with desperation. "DG2," on the other hand, seems to manage to keep events rolling at a nice clip without constantly overwhelming the player.\n\nWhat it all amounts to is a smartly balanced experience that keeps the player returning. It's amazing to look up at the time counter and realize that a 20+ minute map has just flown by. The banter between the various AI personalities is also done very well, and flavors the action nicely with humor, drama, and a really good bit of mystery. Hidden Path has definitely crafted another gem.","June 7, 2015","true","16.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game balance has been changed to reward educated experimentation over "trial-error-rollback-repeat," and it also feels like each map can be done well in more than one way. The continuous resource accumulation helps to eliminate some of the more punishing aspects of the first game. With tower-currency flowing in steadily, it's much more possible to recover from mistakes.\n\n"Defense Grid 2" certainly feels more expansive than its predecessor, with a larger number of tower pads to build on and a much more viable long-range game. I would even go so far as to say that a major key to the experience is getting strong use out of missile and meteor towers: You'll definitely want their ability to keep delivering damage over a large surface area.\n\nThe game's pacing has also been tweaked. "Defense Grid" sometimes felt ponderous, even if that ponderousness was also coupled with desperation. "DG2," on the other hand, seems to manage to keep events rolling at a nice clip without constantly overwhelming the player.\n\nWhat it all amounts to is a smartly balanced experience that keeps the player returning. It's amazing to look up at the time counter and realize that a 20+ minute map has just flown by. The banter between the various AI personalities is also done very well, and flavors the action nicely with humor, drama, and a really good bit of mystery. Hidden Path has definitely crafted another gem.","June 7, 2015","true","16.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The additional towers are great additions and fit well into the balance scheme, and the new scoring system encourages use of the Orbital Laser (as well as the various new Commander abilities) as a part of your tactical decision making (whereas it punished your score in the first game).\n\nThe story isn't particularly compelling, but you will get a few chuckles out of it, and there are some loose ends wrapped up.

It's a good looking game with some great map design, a nice variety of enemies and nice selection of towers and upgrade paths.\n\nI did find it was a bit system intensive and occassionally a bit buggy, and it could have maybe done with a little more time spent on the optimisation rather than graphics. I'm also not a huge fan of the plot (and find the necessity to include a storyline in a tower defense game a little superfluous if I'm honest), and the voice acting gets a little grating, but I can appreciate the developers attempt to tie each of the levels together and push you through the campaign.\n\nAt it's current price of about £18 it may be one for just the die hard fans but as time goes on and more maps are created (and if the price drops a little) I definitely think its worth picking up whether you're a hardcore strategist after the highest score possible or you want something little more casual you can dip in and out of.

Got it for Multiplayer. It *MIGHT* be viable for single player gameplay but its multiplayer is the worst piece of crap I have Ever experienced. It's obvious that this game was designed for single player and added in multiplayer as an after thought. Not only after a story multiplayer mission does it not continue the story, your only two options are to exit and recreate a lobby to select the Next mission or go back to select the Next Mission Anyway rather than the typical "Continue" type mechanic. What the hell type of thinking is this?\n\nThere's no reason to play Multiplayer. None. Nothing.\nYou share resources in multiplayer. They are Completely shared. It turns into two different people creating something together to one person directing where things go and the 2nd player sitting along for the ride. It is Ridiculous.\n\n\nThe towers are horrible and boring. The first three are a standard machine gun tower, an inferno AoE one, and a cannon that trumps all in damage regardless of AoE or single target.\nThe UI itself is horrible, there's no sort of obvious hotkey system which makes you Repeatedly go into your setting just to look them up. The tutorial is basic at best and gives you almost no information. Nothing about the heat map, etc. In multiplayer they STILL give you a Single Player tutorial regardless of your mode. For example the tooltips still pop up for the Fast Forward feature which is a Single Player only option.\n\n\nThis is lazy game designing and should be marketed as a single player game. It *might* be decent in the single player aspect but I Still find the gameplay itself boring and horrendous.

Take the platform, that you build and then place a tower on it, adding height and range.\nThis can change and extend the kill zone or giving a previous unusable spot a potential tower.\n\nAlso the maps are no longer static. One level was transformed after about 30% of the waves had passed, adding a lot more room, and changed the layout and the entire planning of the map.\n\nWell, since it is still early access it's hard to say what the final product may be, but what I have tried I really like. they improved the game, carefully adding features that adds more interesting gameplay without hurting the things that made DG so good.

This doesn't quite live up to its predecessor unfortunately.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe UI / Menu system is horrendous (outside of the gameplay itself).  Too much going on and the "continue" buttons could be in the center of the screen on one menu, then lower right on the next, then the upper left.  It's also not easy to distinguish what should be grabbing your focus to continue on any given menu.\n\nThe towers and monsters have lost a lot of their visual uniqueness.  I'm not sure if it's because the monsters are smaller (larger overall maps?) or what but most of the time you won't tell one monster from another.  I'm not sure what it is about the towers.  They are incredibly detailed when zoomed in but when zoomed out that detail kind of obscures what the tower is compared to different towers.\n\nThe story is...not great.  Not sure why they needed to add a ton of new A.I. characters but for the most part I didn't feel they added anything (plus it was easy lose track of who was who).\n\nThe good:\n\nIt, for the most part, still plays like DG1 and is a fun tower defense game","November 30, 2014","true","6.2"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","15","29","0","0"

Opposite to many RTS and also Tower Defense games that come out today, it required thinking, strategical placement, spamming one tower rarely got you anywhere and if it did, the score would be far too low to compete with your friends, let alone the leaderboard. Add the flair of Raspberry-Fetishist Fletcher's voice, and it was one of the most fun games to play while still producing a challenge.\n\nDG2 had the difficult job of following that up. After playing through the campaign, I am happy to say that it does so flawlessly. The Story connects to the Add-On "Containment" and thanks to excellent voice acting lets you sympathize even with AIs. And for Fans of the first game, it has one of the biggest twists you can imagine.\n\nBut where the game shines is gameplay. If you're new to Tower Defense games, play on lower difficulties, ease into it, learn placement and what tower to chose in what situation, about forming paths and defending the cores bit by bit, and if you fail, one button is enough for a return to the last checkpoint. It's the simplicity that helps. However, advanced TD gamers will find the harder difficulties a challenge, especially if you want to compete scorewise. It's a dance on a razors edge, one mistake early in the game can lead to total failure 20 minutes later.\n\nThe new elements like the Boost tower (which is just a base that lets you control line of sight and boosts tower on top of it)  integrate perfectly with all the towers and aliens we know from Part 1. Most towers have been well redesigned, the only one I don't like is the cannon tower. The old Triple-Cannon which seemed like taken directly from a Battleship gave the tower a sense of might, as where the new one looks more like the pneumatic experiment of a sixth grader that shoots  shells by compressing air *cough* which is too bad because if well placed, it's an essential part of any strategy especially later in the game. I'm also not quite sure about the "Recieve ressources in ticks rather than interest" thing, holding off spending your cash until the last moment was an integral thing for competing for highscores, waiting a few seconds before placing a tower could mean the difference between just some score or an attack on the Top 10. Time will tell if the new system holds the same competitiveness.\n\nIf you loved DG1, I can wholeheartedly suggest DG2 to you. You'll find everything you liked about the first part, overhauled and redesigned, with several new elements added that can create a new challenge you first have to develop a working strategy to (Took me some time to get the hang about dealing with the tower disabling alien even on lower difficulties), and of course we got Fletcher back who alone is worth this game. If you're new to Tower Defense, DG is the perfect brand to start, it won't overwhelm you directly, but you have to use your brain or the aliens will be out the door with all the cores before you figured out how to upgrade your towers.\n\nAnd for long term fun, there's DG Architect, the map creator, which is included. I'm very much looking forward to finding some of the challenges the Steam Community builds. And of course just kicking some more alien behind is always fun ;)","October 4, 2014","true","96.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While you're playing through the game, you unlock selectable perks for the towers (Laser slows target; Cannon does aoe damage in a 5 degree cone, Inferno does more single target damage etc). Additionally, towers can be built on boost blocks giving them special abilities (more damage; decloaking; increased score etc).\n\nThe story is a bit too confusing - very quickly I was lost even at the quite simple question who of those bunch of voices is supposed to be an AI and who not. The Level intro texts donn't help much, because they seem to be telling a completely different story at first.\n\nIn the top right corner you can see how you are doing in comparison to your friends during every step of the level.\n\nThere are many modes for the levels that add quite some replayability.\nIf you just want to play the levels once, you'll be done with this in ~12-15hours. There is also a level editor integrated.\n\nThumbs up for TD :D","October 8, 2014","true","25.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The graphics are slightly better than the first Defense Grid, but the excellent gameplay and mechanics have returned and have also been refined and enhanced.  One of DG2's greatest strengths is its level design.  Now the levels are bigger and better, but more importantly, they evolve and that changes up the gameplay considerably (in a good way).  D♥♥♥♥lso features some online multiplayer and co-operative gameplay which will appeal to those who love multiplayer strategy games.  The core of the game still revolves around buying, placing, and upgrading towers, but DG2 takes the classic formula and almost perfects it.  The story and narrative is interesting but of course it comes secondary to the mechanics and the overall polish found in the implementation of DG2's features and it's slick and easy to use inteface.  It's a little more expensive than the original Defense Grid when it first came out, but if you're enjoy the genre and loved the prequel, then you'll love DG2.  The $24.99 price tag is steep if you're a casual gamer or casual TD player, but the increased cost is well worth it if you consider the extra gameplay and replay value to be had from DG2's multiplayer modes and the inclusion of a level editor and Steam Workshop support.  On top of all of that, Steam achievements and online statistics make a return from the first game with even more detailed info that will allow you to compare scores and compete with your friends or other players from around the world.\n\nSo if you're a casual player of the genre, I'd recommend waiting for a sale or a slight price drop.  Everyone else who likes sinking their teeth into a good Strategy game or Tower Defense, and those who also like multiplayer modes in those genres, look no further - because DG2 will keep you entertained and occupied for quite some time.","September 23, 2014","true","2.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I think the reason is that the farthest zoom level is for a map overview.\n\nThe zoom levels are very easy to control in that there are three zoom levels, not a gradual scroll-wheel style zoom. It very much seems like this was developed for console controls, which is perfectly fine for me, but may frustrate people who want to play on a keyboard and mouse.\n\nWhile speed up on toggle instead of press may seem like an odd change (it's optional, but it's the default setting), it seems more natural once you've adjusted to it.\n\nResource points advance with time, but also on wave completion, not on kill.\n\nIf you liked Defense Grid, and you're not allergic to console controls and a nice comfy couch, DG2 is a huge recommend+.","December 19, 2014","true","31.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

After a long saga of development including a failed Kickstarter campaign, the final result is something that improves upon the formula in some ways, but in other ways just made things much too confusing both for casual players and dedicated players alike.\n\nDG1's most memorable and perfect aspect was probably its scoring system. It was very simple: killing aliens awards resources, but you earn compound interest on your stored resources every few seconds, and your money basically becomes your score. Therefore, the tiniest change in strategy, especially at the beginning of the map, could result in an exponentially bigger score thanks to the accumulated compound interest. Despite its simplicity, aiming for high scores or even surviving the more difficult challenges was a ridiculously deep and complex experience, and hugely satisfying.\n\nIn DG2, they scrapped this system altogether in favor of something more confusing that the game doesn't even take the time to explain. You don't earn compound interest anymore. Instead, you earn 10 free resources every few seconds, in addition to a fixed amount of resources after killing a wave of enemies. You earn points every time you kill an enemy, with (an arbitrary amount of) points awarded if you have more resources, and (an arbitrary amount of) less points awarded if you spent more money on towers. But it's needlessly confusing and the fandom is still not too sure how exactly it works and why playing more efficiently sometimes seems to result in a lower score. Plus, thanks to the orbital laser strike now awarding points, it's now possible to abuse the scoring system using some of the game's features, taking the game's focus away from tower placement and maze design.\n\nDG1's storytelling was minimalist, yet effective: at the beginning of each map, Fletcher would recite some lines which both characterized himself, hinted at the backstory, and explained the new game mechanics all at once. It was honestly compelling.\n\nIn DG2, they threw about 6 AIs (and one human) together in the same room, and made them all drunk. At the beginning and end of every mission they spend upwards of five minutes rambling about desperately unfunny nonsense and leading up to a single, painfully predictable plot twist on the last level (the alien rune text even gives it away almost immediately!) The mission briefings can all be summarized as follows: "BLAH BLAH BLAH I LOVE THE MOOOOON!" "I know this sounds weird, but we really need to have a talk about raspberries." "Wow, isn't it weird how corrupted and single-minded we're all becoming? I wonder what's causing it?" "LOOK OUT, ALIENS INCOMING!" Needless to say, many people turn off the narration, and I don't blame them. At least the in-game banter is a bit more varied and interesting than in DG1, where Fletcher would whine about his cores every few seconds. Now they just sing the praises of boost towers.\n\nBoost towers are the only real new tower introduced in DG2, aside from the missile tower which now acts as a homing shot against ground units, due to flying mobs being completely removed. Boost towers act as a raised platform on which you can build any other tower type.  I started out thinking boost towers were annoying, but they really grew on me after a few missions: they allow cheap creation of mazes while saving gun choices for later, as well as allowing one of three special effects to a tower. There are also many new kinds of aliens, which is a welcome and expected addition.\n\nIn DG1, each mission had about 10 extra modes, ranging from 99-wave challenges to 10-tower limit challenges. Getting a high score on a leaderboard was a hardcore task requiring some annoying skills like juggling, but you also had the choice of fixed-path maps or challenges with disabled interest, meaning you could choose a map or a mode where you don't have to juggle if you don't want to. Simple, elegant, straightforward.\n\nIn DG2, they went with the "Everything and the kitchen sink" method of game balance. Not only do they have about 10 different game modes per map, but four difficulty levels, loadout perks for your towers, choice of about 7 effects for the orbital laser, and a "competitive" setting which disables loadout perks, and another one which disables selling of towers. That's a lot of options. But it makes it difficult to determine what modes and settings you *should* be using, especially if you intend to join the competetive scene, verses what modes you'll just be wasting your time with. It seems like the designers said "it's too much work to balance the game, here's hundreds of play modes per level, go balance the game yourself." Options are great, but this is confusing and overwhelming, especially since the actual gameplay itself -- the design and pacing of the enemy waves -- seems a bit rushed and not so well thought-out.\n\nDG2 is beautiful. The graphics are a great improvement to the original game, and the in-game HUD is amazing, even showing a miniature score ticker so you can measure your performance against previous attempts in real time. However, the main menu is a disastrous and confusing pile of options that's non-intuitive and designed primarily for a controller. Plus all the options reset themselves whenever you choose a new game mode, making it a bit frustrating and intimidating just to start a game the way you want. More than once I've selected the wrong mode or the wrong difficulty, just because changing some options will change other options without telling you.\n\nD♥♥♥♥dds a some truly interesting co-op and competitive multiplayer, including modes with shared and separate scores and resource pools. However, the checkpoint and fast-forward features are unavailable during co-op, meaning that playing a Grinder mission with a friend will literally take an hour.\n\nSpeaking of the fast-forward feature, it was broken in DG1 -- using it at any time could alter fate, as it created fuzzy and non-deterministic estimations of future events. Meteor towers randomly wouldn't strike their targets, temporal towers wouldn't pulse at the same time, and towers in general would choose to target different enemies than before. Hoping this was fixed in DG2? It's not. In fact, it got worse.\n\nDG1 had a staggering number of DLC and map packs to play. Six campaigns in total, including the original campaign, and a Portal cross-over. DG2 has nothing. Sure, you can make and share your own maps with the community, but it doesn't use Steam workshop. Instead, you have to download them from third-party sites, and some even cost money. Um... what? I actually thought that it was against Steam's terms of service for a game to redirect you to a third-party site for paid DLC where you can't use your Steam Wallet funds. Isn't this why EA got Dragon Age II and some of its other games kicked off of Steam?\n\nOverall, despite its many steps in the wrong direction, DG2 is worthy of playing for any fan of DG1, especially if you were really hungering for online co-op. Good graphics, good maps, good new features and ideas. Just don't go into it expecting the best Tower Defense experience ever, or something that can replace its predecessor. Instead, try to see it for what it is: a complement to the original game, something like one final glorious expansion set to Defense Grid: The Awakening, and remember that you can always return to the original game whenever you want.","January 16, 2015","true","35.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

And only if you really enjoyed DG1 and go in to this with lowered expectations))\n\nDefense Grid 2 shows a number of changes, but only a couple of those changes were for the better.\nThe Good:+ It's still a good Tower Defense game.  (Just not a great one any more).\n+ Graphics and the rotatable view.\n+ Fly-overs showing overview of mission map.\n+ Ability to show the path the aliens will take.\n\nThe Eh:~ A GRAPH of my score during gameplay?  OK.  Why?\n~ Mission medal awarded solely on mission score; regardless of # of cores lost.\n~ Boost Towers?  Needless complication / addition to game...\n~ "Normal" difficulty seems easier than DG1.  Either I'm MUCH better than I was when I played DG1, but I received GOLD on every mission with only have to restart or go to an earlier checkpoint on a couple missions in the campaign.  In DG1, um, I am proud of the few gold medals I did earn in my first play through.\n~ Large size of some maps, changes the 'feel of the game'.\n~ Why all the different types of orbital lasers now?\n~ "Heat Map" of where you caused the most dmg to aliens.  OK, it's "pretty" but you already know where you cause the most dmg.\n\nThe Bad:- The Radar in DG1 showing the upcoming alien types I liked SO MUCH better than what they did in DG2.\n- Voice Acting.  OMG.  Voice acting is not just bad, it's truly awful!  The returning voice of General Fletcher is good, Cai's delivery was OK (until the dialog turned cringe-worthy), but the rest were terrible regardless of the dialog.\n- The post-mission banter/story by the voice actors / AI's (and even DURING a mission) is horrible.\n- The complete gibberish at the start of a level shown by alien/encrypted text giving another viewpoint of the story.  Just nonsense.\n- More confusing game menus and pre-mission tower configurations/upgrades, given no explanation.\n- Missile Towers remain, but no flying aliens in DG2??\n- Level design is not as varied as DG1.  Larger maps, but generally 1 way in, and 1 way out.\n- Rank removed from mission summary?  I loved that feature of DG1!  Though you can browse the leaderboard to (slowly) determine your rank after a mission, you have to go looking for it.\n\nSummary:Defense Grid 2 while still enjoyable, is not nearly so much so as DG1.

Defense Grid: The Awakening was  the first successful retail tower game that I can remember, and it did everything well. There was a great difficulty curve, and there was a lot of replayability.\n\nSomehow, the developers took everything the first Defense Grid had, made it just a little bit worse, and released it as a sequel. I can not really put my finger on why, but I did not enjoy this one as much as the first game.\n\nThe humor is a big miss, and the dialogue is far more annoying than entertaining. Instead of one AI commentating, there is a squad of them bantering back and forth, and very quickly it becomes more noisy than interesting. The AI also seem to enjoy talking for awhile after you finish a mission, either delaying you or forcing you to miss the story to get some more gameplay.\n\nThe game is much easier than the first one, and very few maps gave me any trouble. It is seemingly impossible to play through on hard for your first time, though, because you need to upgrade your towers with rare drops. The main campaign missions don't last long, and I didn't feel an urge to play the side missions.\n\nI still had a good time with the game, but it is a disappointing sequel to one of the best tower defense games ever. If you're craving more Defense Grid, it can't hurt to pick up for a lower price, but it definitely leaves something to be desired.","February 17, 2015","true","10.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/carth/recommended/221540/","carth","Carth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/carth/","336 products in account","Defense Grid 2 is a good tower defense game, but not the best. The best is still the first game, Defense Grid: The Awakening. If you've played the first game, they have basically improved the graphics and added/tweaked some things (not necessarily for the better). If you haven't played the first game, buy that instead. It's a much, much better game, with much higher replayability and a lot more levels.\n\nThe main differences in DG2:\n\n- Instead of command towers you now have boost towers. They end up being a bit of a resource burden since not using a boost tower is always worse than using one and you can't go back and add one later. They are useful to cheaply control the path of aliens though.\n\n- Flying enemies have been removed, although missile towers remain and now fill the same role as meteor towers.\n\n- You can sometimes alter the terrain and create new build areas, although this feature wasn't explained and I didn't learn about it until almost finishing the game. It is not actually needed to succeed, so kind of pointless.\n\n- Towers now have passive upgrade items of different rarities, and at the start of a mission you can choose which one to have for each tower. You randomly unlock them after finishing a mission. They slightly alter the way towers behave, for example making lasers slow down foes, making guns pierce shields or making cannons damage multiple enemies. They come in different levels, so eventually you can have quite overpowered towers and these are needed for playing on higher difficulties.\n\n- There is now a level editor and people can sell their levels via Steam Workshop.\n\n- There are now some multiplayer modes, which I haven't tried yet so can't comment on, however the co-operative mode in which you share resources seems pointless. Considering you normally know where you want to put your towers, I'm not sure how having another player placing them would ever be helpful. Seems like it would only make things harder. The other multiplayer modes might be more worthwhile.\n\n- There are now alternatives to the orbital laser that you unlock as you go along. These are quite useful and suit different playstyles (e.g. slowing aliens, giving you some free resources).\n\n- Tower balance: from what I remember of the first game it has been tweaked somewhat. It's not so reliant on guns and cannons, while other towers like lasers and concussion are more valuable.\n\n- Scoring: they have changed how scoring works and the game also feels easier (I got gold on every mission very easily). The scoring seems more focused on killing aliens as fast as possible, whereas the first game involved more careful resource management to get big scores and you had to be more careful about when you built towers if you wanted to earn the most interest. The scoring seems much more variable now and less precise. However, a recent patch added the ability to play with the old scoring style. It also shows you your score on a graph while playing, with someone on your friend's list to compare with, which is a really nice feature.\n\nI found the campaign to be a bit short, the voice acting is very annoying and distracting and continues for too long after you finish a level, and the story is bad (although I guess in this kind of game that doesn't matter). But the game is also not challenging or compelling. Replaying levels in different modes is boring.\n\nUltimately this is a fun game, but they have lost the perfect formula that made the first game so addictive and replayable. DG2's biggest fault is that it is not DG1.","March 27, 2015","true","16.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Aliens spawn from one or more locations in progressively harder waves, move towards your base, steal power cores, and attempt to escape. The player has to stop them by spending limited resource points to place towers such as lasers and flamethrowers, in specific build locations around the map.\n\nIs it any good?\n\nAbsolutely. Tower Defence has become one of my favourite genres, I've had alot of fun with the original Defense Grid (Steam tells me I've played it for 84 hours) and several other games, so I was expecting to enjoy D♥♥♥♥nd it has not let me down.\n\nWhat pleased me?\n\n•	Level design. There's a nice mixture of narrow paths, wide open plazas where you can build a maze, and multiple paths that force you to split resources.\n•	New types of aliens. One can regenerate health when not taking damage, another gives off an EMP that temporarily disables nearby towers when it dies, and there's also a dropship that lands next to your base and spawns a bunch of other aliens.\n•	Tower loadouts. There aren't many new towers, but each tower can unlock new special abilities that are equipped pre-mission. For example, lasers can slow down the targeted alien, teslas can disable an alien's stealth ability, and several other towers can automatically prioritise the strongest alien in range.\n•	Orbital laser has alternate modes, such as shooting towers to overcharge them and do more damage for a short time, or shooting loose cores to teleport them back to base.\n•	All of the above points result in lots of tactical depth and variety.\n•	Value for money. There are 20 maps, they all have multiple alternate challenge modes, and 4 difficulty levels. You can potentially spend dozens of hours trying to achieve a gold medal on each one.\n•	Your current score is displayed while playing, which is really useful to see how close you are to earning a medal.\n•	Stability. I've only suffered 1 crash in 10 hours, and the developers have just released a patch which should fix the most common crash reasons.\n\nWhat disappointed me?\n\n•	The story is nonsensical gibberish and voice acting is poor. However, I don't think Tower Defence games need to be strong in this area, so its not a big problem.\n\nOverall recommendation\n\nIf you like Tower Defence, buy D♥♥♥♥t full price. If you've never played the genre, DG2 would be a good game to start with.

Aliens spawn from one or more locations in progressively harder waves, move towards your base, steal power cores, and attempt to escape. The player has to stop them by spending limited resource points to place towers such as lasers and flamethrowers, in specific build locations around the map.\n\nIs it any good?\n\nAbsolutely. Tower Defence has become one of my favourite genres, I've had alot of fun with the original Defense Grid (Steam tells me I've played it for 84 hours) and several other games, so I was expecting to enjoy D♥♥♥♥nd it has not let me down.\n\nWhat pleased me?\n\n•	Level design. There's a nice mixture of narrow paths, wide open plazas where you can build a maze, and multiple paths that force you to split resources.\n•	New types of aliens. One can regenerate health when not taking damage, another gives off an EMP that temporarily disables nearby towers when it dies, and there's also a dropship that lands next to your base and spawns a bunch of other aliens.\n•	Tower loadouts. There aren't many new towers, but each tower can unlock new special abilities that are equipped pre-mission. For example, lasers can slow down the targeted alien, teslas can disable an alien's stealth ability, and several other towers can automatically prioritise the strongest alien in range.\n•	Orbital laser has alternate modes, such as shooting towers to overcharge them and do more damage for a short time, or shooting loose cores to teleport them back to base.\n•	All of the above points result in lots of tactical depth and variety.\n•	Value for money. There are 20 maps, they all have multiple alternate challenge modes, and 4 difficulty levels. You can potentially spend dozens of hours trying to achieve a gold medal on each one.\n•	Your current score is displayed while playing, which is really useful to see how close you are to earning a medal.\n•	Stability. I've only suffered 1 crash in 10 hours, and the developers have just released a patch which should fix the most common crash reasons.\n\nWhat disappointed me?\n\n•	The story is nonsensical gibberish and voice acting is poor. However, I don't think Tower Defence games need to be strong in this area, so its not a big problem.\n\nOverall recommendation\n\nIf you like Tower Defence, buy D♥♥♥♥t full price. If you've never played the genre, DG2 would be a good game to start with. I don't think its essential to play the first game to enjoy the sequel.","October 10, 2014","true","34.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

There. This is a review to dispel some of the wrong and inaccurate information in many negative reviews, that almost made me NOT buy the game!\n\nI am currently at Level 6 out of 20, so I have completed 1/4 of the game. This gives me enough information to write a first review. Here are some of the main complaints and what I think about them:\n\n1. People complaining that the game is too easy and everyone can beat it on gold and that they can't show off their virtual ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and don't know how to distinguish themselves and increase their score.\n\nA: No, the game is NOT too easy. There are 4 difficulty modes. I play on normal. Normal is pretty relaxed so far. There are 2 difficulties above that. I imagine they can be pretty hard. You also have additional challenge modes. You should not get bored unless you're maybe extremely good, but the average john will be challenged with normal alone.\n\nYour score is calculated whenever you kill an enemy alien. The score depends on the alien, how much money you have when you kill the alien and how many cores you still possess while killing said alien, while floating cores (the ones not at your core station) count only partially. Only cores that have been taken out of the map do not count at all. Apparently, the scoring system works very similarly to DG 1, but in real time. So this point of criticism is not valid in my opinion.\n\n2. People complaining about the resource system and that they have removed interest.\n\nA: This is technically not correct. You now receive a fixed income rate per "tick", namely 10, that is true. At the end of a round or every second round (I have to admit I haven't exactly figured that out) you get bonus money based on how much money you have NOT yet spent, meaning the more money you have available the bigger the bonus, i.e. interest. This is explained in the 3rd mission I think. People need to read and pay attention and not provide misinformation (almost every negative review that I read had this issue). So, not only does it pay off to play conservatively in terms of score, but also in terms of money and thus longevity/sustainability. Edit: I forgot to mention that you do no longer gain credits by killing aliens, that's true and it didn't even occur to me...that's bs. That's also why the command tower is gone I think.\n\n3. People complaining about how horrible the UI is.\n\nA: I have no idea what they are complaining about. People just complain. The UI is perfectly fine. You can get all the required information, it is simple to use etc. You can activate paths, you can show tower impact ranges, building and upgrading towers is as easy or easier than before AND you can play the game with a game pad just as well as with mouse and keyboard, which is brilliant. I personally am a mouse player primarily but I like to use the controller for this, because I can and it’s easy to use. (Update: Just checked and you can also use it in DG 1 but it is slower. Works fine too, however.)\n\n4. People complaining about the graphics and style.\n\nA: I have to agree here that DG 1 simply had clearer visuals. They tried too much with DG 2. It basically still looks the same, but with a lot more clutter and effects. Aliens and towers are harder to distinguish, although I’d say towers can are still easy to distinguish. Aliens on the other hand feel a bit bland, but mostly I can still see what I’m dealing with. The UI also tells you in the wave information. Personally I wish they had not changed the engine. It didn’t make a lot of sense and probably cost a lot of money. It’s not “ugly”, however.\n\n5. People complaining about the performance.\n\nA: Personally I couldn’t see any real lag, even with larger alien crowds. Maybe this happens later on. I did notice, however, that the game “seems” a bit sluggish in general.\n\n6. People complaining about the sound.\n\nA: This is unfortunately absolutely correct. The gun towers simply drown out all other sounds. You could barely hear them in DG 1, but in DG 2 one or 2 gun towers feel like a Manowar concert. You can still hear most other towers if you are in the vicinity, but especially the concussion and the cannon tower are basically silent towers, which is very sad, at least in the cannon tower case, because that “oomph” rocked! I always did hate the concussion tower sound.\n\n7.  People complaining about the unimaginative level design.\n\nA: Can’t really comment on that. So far the first 5 missions were pretty basic in design. You have to keep in mind, though, that this is not an expansion, but a new game, thus early levels must be simple to have a good learning curve for new players. Will see how it will be later on.\n\n8. People complaining about the story and the AI chatter.\n\nA: The story is…well, it’s a TD. Who cares, really? I do partially. Fletcher is still great. The others are ok. Before each level you get glimpses into the aliens mind set…this seems “interesting”. So far the chatter has been ok. I think you can also just disable the sound for that? Not sure. Just waiting for the raspberries!\n\n9. People complaining about the workshop integration.\n\nA: This is actually a pretty strong negative point for the game. Apparently you can “vote” for maps in the workshop, which then become available on the official DG store. I checked and one map seems to cost TWO dollars!!! TWO. Not only is it ridiculous to sell them, but the price is so over the top it is not even funny anymore. If you value community created content, this might be the point for you to NOT purchase the game.\n\nNow some general info:\n\n-	Aliens: There are a few new ones. Some that regen health. Nothing too interesting. I’m not sure if they took some out. Didn’t look like it, but could be. All in all, pretty boring stuff if you played DG 1.\n-	Towers: The tower encyclopedia in game does not list ANY new tower at all. In fact, the command tower is now missing…I think that’s the only 1 though.\n-	Boost blocks: You can build these cheap blocks to create mazes and put your towers on to give them additional effects like increased damage or cloak detect…etc. The concept is “ok”, the execution is…meh. You basically want to build them for every tower, because they only cost 50 credits and without them a tower can simply do 20%!!!!! Less damage. That is huge. Ofc, the upgrade costs money, but still…20% more damage for 250 credits? Still a good deal. Plus you get extended range and fire arcs. I don’t particularly like it. It is a bit clunky.\n-	Tower bonuses: You unlock bonus abilities for your towers, which you can choose before a mission. For example, my laser tower currently does 15% splash. This is a nice addition, but they could have added more interesting effects. Maybe there will be better ones later, but I somehow doubt it.\n-	Different commander bonuses: You can now choose a special power at the start of a game. No longer just orbital laser.\n\nAll in all I would say that DG 2 is a good TD game. IF you have played DG 1 you might find that better in some aspects. It also has more maps to play on. IF you have NOT played DG 1…get DG 1 lol. No, seriously. DG 2 is not a bad game, but DG 1 is better imho. It is not as bad as people make it out to be and I will recommend it, but ONLY at a severely reduced price. Right now, it is 66% off…so only 8 euros or so, which is ok to get a few hours of new tower defense stuff.\nOverall, however, the “changes” and “additions”, wherever they are, do not warrant a full price…and the community map selling is just plain evil. The creators probably get some small amount for each purchased map, but if you are a map creator and doing this for the money, you’re doing it wrong. I loved creating Star Craft Maps back in the day…it would have never occurred to me to charge anything for that…pffft.","December 19, 2014","true","6.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Defense Grid 2, seems to be a worthy successor with a few upgraded aliens, some new graphics, good sound, excellent writing, superb voice acting, well balanced maps, and some neat tower upgrades. I've seen reviews that say it's just a re-hash of the first one, and I guess about 90% of the gameplay is the same, but that sure didn't douse my enthusiasm or diminish the fun I've had playing the first 10 levels of the campaign. In short, if you liked the first one, this is a worthy successor. If you haven't played the first one and you're not sure you want to plop down the cash, go try Defense Grid 1 out first. It's a cheaper investment and you can catch up on the story before sitting down in the middle of this one.","July 21, 2015","true","6.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Nothing too interesting. I’m not sure if they took some out. Didn’t look like it, but could be. All in all, pretty boring stuff if you played DG 1.\n-	Towers: The tower encyclopedia in game does not list ANY new tower at all. In fact, the command tower is now missing…I think that’s the only 1 though.\n-	Boost blocks: You can build these cheap blocks to create mazes and put your towers on to give them additional effects like increased damage or cloak detect…etc. The concept is “ok”, the execution is…meh. You basically want to build them for every tower, because they only cost 50 credits and without them a tower can simply do 20%!!!!! Less damage. That is huge. Ofc, the upgrade costs money, but still…20% more damage for 250 credits? Still a good deal. Plus you get extended range and fire arcs. I don’t particularly like it. It is a bit clunky.\n-	Tower bonuses: You unlock bonus abilities for your towers, which you can choose before a mission. For example, my laser tower currently does 15% splash. This is a nice addition, but they could have added more interesting effects. Maybe there will be better ones later, but I somehow doubt it.\n-	Different commander bonuses: You can now choose a special power at the start of a game. No longer just orbital laser.\n\nAll in all I would say that DG 2 is a good TD game. IF you have played DG 1 you might find that better in some aspects. It also has more maps to play on. IF you have NOT played DG 1…get DG 1 lol. No, seriously. DG 2 is not a bad game, but DG 1 is better imho. It is not as bad as people make it out to be and I will recommend it, but ONLY at a severely reduced price. Right now, it is 66% off…so only 8 euros or so, which is ok to get a few hours of new tower defense stuff.\nOverall, however, the “changes” and “additions”, wherever they are, do not warrant a full price…and the community map selling is just plain evil. The creators probably get some small amount for each purchased map, but if you are a map creator and doing this for the money, you’re doing it wrong. I loved creating Star Craft Maps back in the day…it would have never occurred to me to charge anything for that…pffft.","December 19, 2014","true","6.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And only if you really enjoyed DG1 and go in to this with lowered expectations))\n\nDefense Grid 2 shows a number of changes, but only a couple of those changes were for the better.\nThe Good:+ It's still a good Tower Defense game.  (Just not a great one any more).\n+ Graphics and the rotatable view.\n+ Fly-overs showing overview of mission map.\n+ Ability to show the path the aliens will take.\n\nThe Eh:~ A GRAPH of my score during gameplay?  OK.  Why?\n~ Mission medal awarded solely on mission score; regardless of # of cores lost.\n~ Boost Towers?  Needless complication / addition to game...\n~ "Normal" difficulty seems easier than DG1.  Either I'm MUCH better than I was when I played DG1, but I received GOLD on every mission with only have to restart or go to an earlier checkpoint on a couple missions in the campaign.  In DG1, um, I am proud of the few gold medals I did earn in my first play through.\n~ Large size of some maps, changes the 'feel of the game'.\n~ Why all the different types of orbital lasers now?\n~ "Heat Map" of where you caused the most dmg to aliens.  OK, it's "pretty" but you already know where you cause the most dmg.\n\nThe Bad:- The Radar in DG1 showing the upcoming alien types I liked SO MUCH better than what they did in DG2.\n- Voice Acting.  OMG.  Voice acting is not just bad, it's truly awful!  The returning voice of General Fletcher is good, Cai's delivery was OK (until the dialog turned cringe-worthy), but the rest were terrible regardless of the dialog.\n- The post-mission banter/story by the voice actors / AI's (and even DURING a mission) is horrible.\n- The complete gibberish at the start of a level shown by alien/encrypted text giving another viewpoint of the story.  Just nonsense.\n- More confusing game menus and pre-mission tower configurations/upgrades, given no explanation.\n- Missile Towers remain, but no flying aliens in DG2??\n- Level design is not as varied as DG1.  Larger maps, but generally 1 way in, and 1 way out.\n- Rank removed from mission summary?  I loved that feature of DG1!  Though you can browse the leaderboard to (slowly) determine your rank after a mission, you have to go looking for it.\n\nSummary:Defense Grid 2 while still enjoyable, is not nearly so much so as DG1.  Quite a let down.  7.5 out of 10.","January 18, 2015","true","18.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Defense Grid: The Awakening was  the first successful retail tower game that I can remember, and it did everything well. There was a great difficulty curve, and there was a lot of replayability.\n\nSomehow, the developers took everything the first Defense Grid had, made it just a little bit worse, and released it as a sequel. I can not really put my finger on why, but I did not enjoy this one as much as the first game.\n\nThe humor is a big miss, and the dialogue is far more annoying than entertaining. Instead of one AI commentating, there is a squad of them bantering back and forth, and very quickly it becomes more noisy than interesting. The AI also seem to enjoy talking for awhile after you finish a mission, either delaying you or forcing you to miss the story to get some more gameplay.\n\nThe game is much easier than the first one, and very few maps gave me any trouble. It is seemingly impossible to play through on hard for your first time, though, because you need to upgrade your towers with rare drops. The main campaign missions don't last long, and I didn't feel an urge to play the side missions.\n\nI still had a good time with the game, but it is a disappointing sequel to one of the best tower defense games ever. If you're craving more Defense Grid, it can't hurt to pick up for a lower price, but it definitely leaves something to be desired.","February 17, 2015","true","10.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/carth/recommended/221540/","carth","Carth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/carth/","336 products in account","Defense Grid 2 is a good tower defense game, but not the best. The best is still the first game, Defense Grid: The Awakening. If you've played the first game, they have basically improved the graphics and added/tweaked some things (not necessarily for the better). If you haven't played the first game, buy that instead. It's a much, much better game, with much higher replayability and a lot more levels.\n\nThe main differences in DG2:\n\n- Instead of command towers you now have boost towers. They end up being a bit of a resource burden since not using a boost tower is always worse than using one and you can't go back and add one later. They are useful to cheaply control the path of aliens though.\n\n- Flying enemies have been removed, although missile towers remain and now fill the same role as meteor towers.\n\n- You can sometimes alter the terrain and create new build areas, although this feature wasn't explained and I didn't learn about it until almost finishing the game. It is not actually needed to succeed, so kind of pointless.\n\n- Towers now have passive upgrade items of different rarities, and at the start of a mission you can choose which one to have for each tower. You randomly unlock them after finishing a mission. They slightly alter the way towers behave, for example making lasers slow down foes, making guns pierce shields or making cannons damage multiple enemies. They come in different levels, so eventually you can have quite overpowered towers and these are needed for playing on higher difficulties.\n\n- There is now a level editor and people can sell their levels via Steam Workshop.\n\n- There are now some multiplayer modes, which I haven't tried yet so can't comment on, however the co-operative mode in which you share resources seems pointless. Considering you normally know where you want to put your towers, I'm not sure how having another player placing them would ever be helpful. Seems like it would only make things harder. The other multiplayer modes might be more worthwhile.\n\n- There are now alternatives to the orbital laser that you unlock as you go along. These are quite useful and suit different playstyles (e.g. slowing aliens, giving you some free resources).\n\n- Tower balance: from what I remember of the first game it has been tweaked somewhat. It's not so reliant on guns and cannons, while other towers like lasers and concussion are more valuable.\n\n- Scoring: they have changed how scoring works and the game also feels easier (I got gold on every mission very easily). The scoring seems more focused on killing aliens as fast as possible, whereas the first game involved more careful resource management to get big scores and you had to be more careful about when you built towers if you wanted to earn the most interest. The scoring seems much more variable now and less precise. However, a recent patch added the ability to play with the old scoring style. It also shows you your score on a graph while playing, with someone on your friend's list to compare with, which is a really nice feature.\n\nI found the campaign to be a bit short, the voice acting is very annoying and distracting and continues for too long after you finish a level, and the story is bad (although I guess in this kind of game that doesn't matter). But the game is also not challenging or compelling. Replaying levels in different modes is boring.\n\nUltimately this is a fun game, but they have lost the perfect formula that made the first game so addictive and replayable. DG2's biggest fault is that it is not DG1.","March 27, 2015","true","16.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

A good sequel to the famed original, 'Defense Grid: The Awakening' which is hailed by many including myself as the best TD ever made.\n\nThe sequel plays more different than it looks, resource income and scoring is tweaked a bit which has put some off, but is in my opinion an improvement. Boost towers is a great idea which offer extra upgrade options and can be used to adjust towers' line of sight and range.\n\nAll is not perfect however, and here's a few things that should have been better:\n\n- The aliens are poorly designed and it can hard to tell the different types apart at a glance.\n- Bad sound track.  One track for menues and one during playing is extremely repetitive to listen to.\n- Ugly low quality FXAA that one has to fiddle with Steam launch command lines to disable.\n- Leaderboard cheaters is still a thing,  taking some of the drive to replay levels to improve your scores away.\n- UI is clearly designed for gamepad or tablet navigation.  It is so awkward to navigate with mouse+keys I've actually given up and now play this with a PS3 pad instead.  Big disappointment.\n- Monetized Steam Workshop for custom maps that is poorly maintained.  Charging money in a retail product for user generated content is a massive slap in the face, this needs to STOP.\n\nOutside of that, DG2 is very enjoyable and can offer dozens of hours of well designed tower defense gaming for those that must gold medal various game modes.","December 28, 2014","true","92.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","1"

I played the first Defense Grid a few years back mainly on Xbox 360 and I feel the sequel compares quite well. Just like the first game, I was hooked into getting the highest medal possible on each of the levels.\n\nFound the games story mode to be easier than the first Defense Grid (Probably due to the lack of flying enemies I'd forget to pain attention to in the first game). You can complete levels using a variety of different strategies, at least on easier difficulties.\n\nThe graphics are nice and I always felt I could get a decent view of the action by rotating/zooming the camera. I ran the game via SteamOS without issue. I used an Xbox 360 controller, which worked fine but feel that the game caters more to keyboard/mouse/desktop setup. Playing from my couch using a 42 inch display I found it challenging to read the text at times (maybe I'm just getting old).\n\nI liked how the story played out via audio/text at the beginning of each level while you were playing the game. The story was light and non-intrusive.\n\nFingers crossed for Defense Grid 3.","August 20, 2015","true","41.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The gun turrets look more like AA guns now and the cannon turrets look and move vaguely like the mechs in Battlefield 2142.\nThe Medals are back but are purely points based now instead of points and cores like before. I had one core get taken by the aliens in the 2nd map and still got a gold "medal" for it.\nOther tweaks like the graph showing your score over time with the bronze, silver and gold medals appearing at fixed point values for each map make it easier to tell how you are doing on the map.\nYou now have a Command Shuttle as well and if you click on it you can see your mission stats in real time.\nThe AI from DG: tA is back of course but you also have 2 other AI helping you as well and the banter between them and the other AI you encounter is an interesting change.\nBeing able to upgrade your turrets with mods before starting a mission and the new Booster unit with the Overdrive ability are also cool. For a total cost of 250 energy (50 to deploy and 200 to activate Overdrive) I can see them being used in a few strategies.\nI will post an update as I play through the rest of the campaign.","December 28, 2014","true","44.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lionsphil/recommended/221540/","lionsphil","LionsPhil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lionsphil/","165 products in account","It's Defense Grid again. It's solid tower defense. They've shaken the towers up so that cannons aren't the be-all and end-all of defense, an in fact rather than needing half your maze be ballistic to knock down shields, shields are reworked to the point of almost being irrelevant if you place the disruption tower upgrades appropriately. (As a final insult, level 3 cannon towers are now ugly wheezing bellows. This is not how recoil works, animators. The aliens tend to largely all look the same, too.) Airborne enemies are gone completely, although drop pods make for a tactically interesting replacement, running the maze in reverse.\n\nBUT. Big but. Hairline of negative review but.\n\nBut it's deeply, deeply marred by the godawful AI banter. Everything that was mildly charming and background in the last one is now rubbing in your face like a chinchilla-urine-soaked cheese-grater as a badly-written soap opera unfolds between a half-dozen scenery-chewing unlikable characters. Yes, even he from the first game has become insufferable, and they predictably take his one little quirk and roll a whole stupid plot point around it. Do yourself a favour and put the dialogue volume slider down to zero. Then turn off the subtitles too. The story in this will just kill braincells you need to play the actual game.\n\nOh, and there are persistent unlocks, because boy we've sure gotta be next-gen. I've yet to see if they ruin multiplayer, because that was so ill-designed in the beta it discouraged the other player from buying it.\n\nIt also feels short when you put it up against the ridiculous amount of content the first one got. As always, wait for a deep sale. This review would certainly be negative at full price.","January 4, 2015","true","13.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There's a small shuffling of powers, as command towers don't exist but get the same thing from upgrades. The orbital laser can do some new things other than just damage, like slow enemies or buff towers. There are no more flyers, but rather dropships that land at your cores and spawn enemies there. Everything else is pretty much the same, which is disappointing, but since the same is still very good I'm happy with my purchase.","November 29, 2014","true","7.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's more of the same as Defense Grid, which is good, but it lost it's heart. It feels more sterile. It has updated graphics, and the environments does look good, much better than in the first game. But the same can't be said about towers and enemies. Both look awkward to me, the towers looked much more functional in the first game, and their upgrading was much better, now when you upgrade a tower it simply vanishes into a hole, and the new tower emerges in it's place. Lame imo. And the aliens look well just bad, nothing like in the first part. In the first they looked mechanized and tough. Now most of them look like a chicken had a baby with an insect.  Others simply look like insects. And some look like dinosaurs without heads.\n\nBut those are just externalities, if the game mechanics are still there there is no problem right? Sadly this is not the case. Game mechanics are much simplified now. The first game got it's appeal from the fact that the aliens were after your power cores, and the more cores you allow them to take, the less resources you can salvage. So your first aim was always to kill the aliens before they could reach the cores at all. Another fine thing was, that you gained interest for unspent resources. So you couldn't build towers like no tomorrow, because the more money you kept the more you made. This made a very interesting juggle to always have just as much firepower built that is absolutely necessary to kill the next wave of aliens, and no more. Because that meant loss of resources and less score and the end. Or on harder levels lack of resources to build enough defences for the next wave.\n\nNow the basic principle is the same in DG2 too, the aliens come for the cores and take them if you allow them. But the fine details are completely eradicated. It doesn't matter if you kill the aliens before or after taking the cores as it doesn't influence your resources. And interest is fixed, you always have the same resource flow no matter how many credits you have. So it's completely unnecessary to hold back on building, you can empty the treasury all you want all the time with absolutely no repercussions.\n\nTo me this means the game just lost it's heart. Now all you have to focus on is tower placement that's it.\n\nThere are a few new features like upgrades to towers that give them more firepower, or disrupt shields on aliens, or give a score(not resource!) boost, but it's not enough to offset the loss of the things mentioned above. And there is one more thing missing, there are no flyer aliens anymore. All of them are walkers. Or rather there is something that could be considered flyers, as sometimes they drop a pod next to the core housing to hatch aliens right there. Frankly this I feel is cheating in a tower defence game.  It kills the purpose of the game if the enemy can appear right at the finish line.\n\nAmongst other minor new features are self repairing aliens, that if you stop hurting them get back to full health, but as soon as you're prepared for them they make no difference. And aliens that drop shields on levels for other aliens to pick up, but with the disruptor tower upgrade this feature becomes mute too. I mean you don't have to alter your strategy because of it, just upgrade a few towers to disruptor capability and you're set.\n\nAnd you have new superweapons as well, but as I found out most of them are too weak to make a difference. So you'll stick to one or two of them anyway.\n\nUnusually for a tower defense game there is also some kind of back story, but it's even more lame than in the first game. And they went too far with AIs I mean you have these AIs whose only role seems that they spout nonsense into your ear all the time, one of them more annoying than the other. In the first game you only had one, that was fine. If they wanted more characters they should've made some real NPCs not all of them AIs. Or small cutscenes maybe to make it more personal. But there is nothing like that. They wasted money on recording half a dozen idiotistic voices in a studio.\n\nSo that's what I think about Defense Grid 2.\n\nMind you I haven't played all the game modes yet, only the basic campaign. But it feels lacking. If I want to score it it's a 6 out of 10.","September 25, 2014","true","23.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The main reasons for this:\n\n1.  The graphical upgrades from DG1 actually made it harder for me to work out what was going on.  Lots of bells and whistles, but they don't add to the core gameplay, which felt a lot cleaner and more precise in DG1.\n\n2.  The voiceovers.  Goodness me, these are... terrible.  DG1 was characterised by a really quirky voiceover whose occasional glitches and obsession with raspberries was amusing and sometimes a bit sad.  For some reason in DG2 this has been "upgraded" to a banter between at least 3 different characters, that really pushes hard for laughs and fails miserably.  Not funny, just cringeworthy.\n\n3.  Gameplay generally; again the feel isn't there from DG1.  Having the option to build towers on top of other blocks and upgrade them both should in theory have added depth and complexity, but the beauty of DG1 was in figuring out the patterns and where you could divert the enemies to.  The levels of DG2 I was able to grit my teeth through just seemed really dull by comparison - more thinking about which combination of upgrades, and less thinking about pathing.\n\nLike most things, it's just my opinion based on playing for a little while and really failing to enjoy it at all.","March 15, 2015","false","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The main reasons for this:\n\n1.  The graphical upgrades from DG1 actually made it harder for me to work out what was going on.  Lots of bells and whistles, but they don't add to the core gameplay, which felt a lot cleaner and more precise in DG1.\n\n2.  The voiceovers.  Goodness me, these are... terrible.  DG1 was characterised by a really quirky voiceover whose occasional glitches and obsession with raspberries was amusing and sometimes a bit sad.  For some reason in DG2 this has been "upgraded" to a banter between at least 3 different characters, that really pushes hard for laughs and fails miserably.  Not funny, just cringeworthy.\n\n3.  Gameplay generally; again the feel isn't there from DG1.  Having the option to build towers on top of other blocks and upgrade them both should in theory have added depth and complexity, but the beauty of DG1 was in figuring out the patterns and where you could divert the enemies to.  The levels of DG2 I was able to grit my teeth through just seemed really dull by comparison - more thinking about which combination of upgrades, and less thinking about pathing.\n\nLike most things, it's just my opinion based on playing for a little while and really failing to enjoy it at all.","March 15, 2015","false","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreadjaws/recommended/221540/","dreadjaws","Dreadjaws","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreadjaws/","570 products in account","Note: this review is mostly from the PS4 version of the game, which I also own and prefer to play because my Notebook can't handle the PC version very well.  They're the same game, but I've played that one more.  I clarify this because I only have 1 hour clocked on the PC version, and I don't want to give the impression that I haven't played it enough.\n\nThe original Defense Grid is one of the best Tower Defense games in existence.  Heck, it probably is THE best.  Incredibly fun and addictive (in a good way), with a lot of content, varied gameplay and clearly coming from a group of developers who care for their audience and know how to make fun games (as evidenced by the minigames they created for the Portal 2 ARG).\n\nAt first sight, this sequel looks to be the same.  A fantastic entry in the genre with the same basic gameplay and enough upgrades to justify it being a sequel rather than just DLC.  There are new tower types and upgrades, new enemies, new special weapons (the original had only one), a new story and lots of new characters.  There are also new modes to play (with advantages or handicaps) and extra abilities that can be setup before starting each stage.  In short, there's A LOT of content here.\n\nBut, it's an impossible to ignore fact that, when compared to the first game, this one is still inferior.  And this is mostly because of a couple of factors: freedom and balance.  The original game pretty much allowed you to play however you wanted.  It gave you a lot of freedom on how to approach each stage.  This one, though, requires certain stages to be played an exact way if you intend to finish it with a decent score.  This issue causes the second one, as there's a couple of ridiculous difficulty spikes, as in a few stages the game forces you to change your playstyle to something specific if you want to have any chance.  Now you're basically following orders rather than playing for fun.\n\nTo be fair, if you don't care at all about getting medals or keeping all the cores at the end then the difficulty is not a problem.  This is a very easy game in that respect.  Much easier than the first one, actually (there aren't even flying aliens here).  But if you do care for a question of completionism, challenge or achievement hunting, you're going to have a lot of frustration and you'll probably be forced to look for walkthroughs (something that rarely if ever happened on the first game).\n\nIn short, it's still a good game.  Great even if your expectations for gameplay end with "being able to advance to the next stage".  But it's still an undeniably inferior product to the original in aspects that are quite important for this genre.\n\n7/10","May 18","true","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can place towers in specific places but they aren't highlighted well and sometimes are on the path, so knowing they are there would be important.\n\nThere's very poor visual feedback and the game is extremely easy to just zone out during. Any feeling of tension is wiped away due to this. I do not think I can continue playing it, it is just so boring. When I start to fall asleep during a game it is time to uninstall it.

Gun tower nerfed a little bit, they didn't have so much power like in DG1, even stacking it doesn't really help in certain maps, and with no more Air alien making MISSILE tower kinda unnecesarry addition, Meteor tower does it better, Concusion tower in this game get's buff heavily, making Inferno tower kinda in same situation like missile tower.\n\n- Sound, not much different with blast and so on, it's great but I miss building sound from DG1\n\nOverall, DG2 feels like more fantasy instead sci-fi, a bit issue specially graphics keeps me not want to stare at the screen for very long time. I can play DG1 for many hours before my eyes get tired.\n\nDo I recommend it? Yes ofcourse, but if you haven't play DG1, buy that too, and play it in reverse order, play this first, and DG1 later.","November 29, 2014","true","22.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I was very excited to get this game, even more so when I saw co-op. within 5 minutes of playing this game I already could see some issues.\n\nCo-op?? co-op is more like single player with spectate, players SHARE the resource pool effectively making multiple players pointless.\n\nUI - The UI is ugly, clunky and 1 dimensional, it litterly looks like something I made my first term in freshman year for a Photoshop class.\n\nGameplay- is almost the same as defense grid 1, it offers a few new but completely unneeded features.\n\nsettings- this game lack many basic video game options, like changing the sound setting... yep that right you can't change the sound settings. luckily it does support diffrent resolutions, the problem is you need to change it outside of the game, meaning you cannot change it while the game is running...\n\nprice- this game in no way justifies its price its hastily slapped to together, most of the new features like co-op are horrible and had little to no thought put into them.\n\nPAYING FOR FAN MADE CONTENT - yep that’s right they charge you cash for stuff fans made...\n\nI really enjoyed Defense grid one, and i have to say I feel thoroughly cheated. I can't help but feel like Hidden path realized they had a good fan base and made this just to milk them.

Buildings are microscopic compared to the enemy you are combatting and it looks ridiculous to say the least, removing all intimacy from the battles; it would have provided a personal experience if the Grid, Creatures, and Environment were all proportionate to one another. My question is- why go through all the trouble of improving the battle effects, make the weapons systems look really dorky, and the creatures so plain? Is this the “Bold New Look”? This is KIDD STUFF. As for the “Beta Release” Game Play, (3) Graphics, (7) Sound (3) Story (?) = 3.25ish. Bottom line- it’s a new tower defense game to play.

The first Defense Grid is better. DG2 has a mouse problem where the mouse is too sensitive and the setting won't correct but make it worse.  It takes several clicks of the mouse to get the tower menu to appear and then several more clicks to get the choice you want.  By this time, several of the aliens have passed by.  The computer banter is useless and distracting.  When there is a good piece of information, I have already tuned out the banter and missed the info.  DG1 is a classic tower defense game and DG2 is a swing and a miss.  I stopped playing at mission 7 as the mouse arrow was vanishing and pretty useless at bringing up the tower menu.

But as soon as I launched he first campaign, my jaw dropped with dissapointment. The only original feature barely remaining is the grid-based map layouts to filter aliens through, but that's about it! The enemies are barely indestinguishable from each other, way too tough, too fast, the towers all look the same, towers are super weak, and it used to be pretty clear by the borders on the towers where aliens can and can't go, but instead now it shows you a pre-calculated path. The path mechanic I dont think has improved anything because for me, the challenge always seemed to plug the gaps you didn't see, that was the challenge!\nIm sorry, so dissapointed, the art style and game play is for an entirely different game, this is not a good sequel for a legendary game as Defense Grid.","July 22, 2014","false","0.8"," 25 of 62 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","25","62","0","4"

Have been waiting for the sequel eagerly. It's the first game I've eveer bought full price on Steam. I have to say it's disappointing. Almost every aspect of the game feels worse than the original for some reason. The graphics are of lower quality, not just visually, but design-wise. The new designs make everything look very similar. Aliens and towers do not look different enough. The scale also seems off... the aliens are too small when compared to the towers. Graphics are very jagged even on "very high" graphics setting. Disappointed also to see that the final release of the game only has 21 levels. Hoping very much that things improve, but right now, it's not a polished game. Seems unfinished. I don't know what they were working on for so long.","September 21, 2014","false","22.1"," 10 of 32 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","10","32","0","0"

Say hello to my death accordion you aliens lol and the only other nagging point is the heart beat do-dad when you right click on the alien. Wish it truly reflected the aliens health but not at this time…just a looping animation.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nOriginal 4/23/2014\nThe game at this stage is a bit choppy on my system and its also very hard to distinguish the aliens from the path and all the effects that happen from explosions.\n\nI really miss the old simple colors and the clean look and feel. It feels like my computer is working way to hard on fancy graphics. If they had kept the same graphic engine but put all of these new towers, aliens and functions into this DG2 it would probably play allot smother.\n\nHope they tone it down again so I can see what my towers are shooting at and fix this jumpy game play. Esp going from normal speed to fast forward nearly made my system choke.\n\nKeep up the good work though :)\n\nAt this time im saying NO to recommending only because even with my $$$ graphics card the game was graphically sluggish, jumpy, and visually a mess to play.","July 23, 2014","false","61.4"," 12 of 43 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","12","43","0","2"

I like that in this one it shows the pathing so you can immediatly know how placing a tower will affect things. And I also like that you can't even build a tower when it would be blocking. Unlike the first one where you could build the tower, but then they would just walk through. The game looks good and I didn't experience any issues with the single player.\n\nHowever, I did have issues with the multiplayer. I would like to try out the multiplayer, but the two times I tried, it failed to connect. There are other minor issues in my opinion. The menu system is confusing. And the story is worthless. The out of mission tower upgrades are confusing. I have no idea what I did to get them. And there is no free workshop content as far as I could see.\n\nI think many of these issues can still be addressed. Any paid DLC I would hope adds more variety, for example, more tower types, and more alien types, not just one map at a time.

Improvements over the original edition were the incorporation of aspects of the “Command Tower” into the Boost tower.  The Boost tower does add a bit more of nuance then the original edition.  Initial maze creation is less costly with the Boost towers, and careful placement of the Boost tower is still essential in winning the game.   If you’ve played the extended versions of the original DG, you’ll find that you will quickly be able to excel at this version.  While the Orbital Laser was the only choice of off-world help in the original edition, DG2 does a very good job in expanding the options to allow tower boosts, resource (money) boost, and more.  Some levels are well suited to these new options, where the Orbital Laser would have been over-kill or less challenging if used.\nWell worth the money, and even better if reduced via a Steam sale price :)\n","December 30, 2014","true","76.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All with nice, fluid gameplay and no lagging.  I am using a mediocre AMD APU grapic processor with only 512mb dedicated ram and I have it set to 'Very high' graphics..\n\nIntially I had noted that I didn't want all the A.I. chatter, but I have since found that I could turn them off, turn down the frequency or just lower the A.I. volume in the settings.  Nice.  People at HP were thinking proactively.\n\nThis promises to be a well spent 25 bucks.  If you liked DG1 or TD games in general, buy it.  For those not already familiar with DG, think of traditional Tower Defense games in general, but with everything bumped up several generations using a gaming engine (Gamebryo) used by some of the larger and more expensive game titles found on Steam.\n\nAs time goes by, I am enjoying this more and more.

The GFX was clear and minimalistic. The aliens and towers very distinctive. It was a game with enourmes replay value due to clever mechanics and good expansions.\n\nThe good news is that it`s still Defense Grid - which means a quality game with good mechanics, and loads of different game types based on the campaign maps.\n\nThe bad news is that they made some changes to the flow and the mechanics of the game. They removed or cut "juggling enemies" from the game  which is a massive mistake imho. It`s one of the core mechanics that made DG 1 stand out against other tower defense games. (I assume it will be reintroduced in some future DLC)\n\nThey`ve made some changes to the towers as well. Most of the towers are pretty much identical to DF 1 when it comes to actual mechanics despite the new paint job. Command towers are gone though, but their functionailty is now tied into a new "tower unit" - the "boost tower" which gives increased heigth and various custombuild options, so you can have a gun tower with increased damage or anti stealth - that sort of thing. Missile towers can now target all units, so it`s no longer an exclusive anti aircraft tower. (I haven`t seen too many aircraft so far)\n\nThere are also more commanders this time and each commander have different "command powers". This just means than in addition to the orbital laser (smart bomb) you get alternatives - like increased tower damage and that sort of thing. It`s a bit like the command powers from Advance Wars.\n\nI haven`t finished the game yet, and hopefully it`ll last me months and months like DG 1 did, but I`ve played enough to have an opinion on the game. To me it feels like a slightly more clunky game with slightly more sterile GFX and aliens. It feels like there`s a bigger emphasis on visual deception.  You spend a lot more time on figuring out what`s going on. What parts of the map are background and what parts are actually important. It`s not always clear what range your tower has or if it`s even on the right altitude. To me that`s the wrong sort of complexity. I prefer the visuals and the design to be clear, so you can concentrate on what`s important - placing the towers, juggling the aliens and so on.\n\nIn the end it`s the difference between a perfect 10 (DG 1) and a score of somewhere around 8-9 which only prolonged play will reveal. I consider 5 to be average, so still a good game.\n\n","September 26, 2014","true","45.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

I bought Defense Grid 2 a few days ago and I am a bit disappointed by this sequel. Indeed where first Defense Grid The Awakening seems polished about graphics and gameplay Defense Grid 2 seems to be a beta version which keep to be improved. First of all game is lagging on my core i5 laptop even in low settings, towers movements are too fast and jerky, aliens are too fast and unreadable, health bars cannot been hidden (?), Inferno and Meteore towers are very shy, Laser tower is ugly, moreover there are too much blah-blah-blah ! I cannot stand all these useless speeches ! Level introduction are too long, who cares about ? We wants action and now ! But game is colorfull and overall packaging is pretty good. In conclusion this sequel is not essential but deserve a try. I hope that Valve Team will read and care about gamers comments and improve Defense Grid 2 as it seems launched too early and need polishing.","October 4, 2014","true","189.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Big, big fan of the first DG, and now a fan of D♥♥♥♥s well.  It's not radically different from DG1, and thats a plus.   Yet there are significant improvements like the rotating perspective, new towers and attackers, more gameplay variations for each map, ammo variations, larger maps, etc...  All with nice, fluid gameplay and no lagging.  I am using a mediocre AMD APU grapic processor with only 512mb dedicated ram and I have it set to 'Very high' graphics..\n\nIntially I had noted that I didn't want all the A.I. chatter, but I have since found that I could turn them off, turn down the frequency or just lower the A.I. volume in the settings.  Nice.  People at HP were thinking proactively.\n\nThis promises to be a well spent 25 bucks.  If you liked DG1 or TD games in general, buy it.  For those not already familiar with DG, think of traditional Tower Defense games in general, but with everything bumped up several generations using a gaming engine (Gamebryo) used by some of the larger and more expensive game titles found on Steam.\n\nAs time goes by, I am enjoying this more and more.

I'd argue that it does so a little too well in some ways, and takes some (minor) steps back in others.\n\nEveryone remarked on the Fletcher NPC performance in the first game, so in this one we get a half dozen NPC narrators experiencing the story with you, snarking and emoting and occasionally screaming.  When it works, it's fun.  ...but it doesn't always work.  There's too many of them to become emotionally invested in, and the plot material doesn't do the voice actors any favors.  The VAs are all good enough, though the voice direction work is uneven.\n\nThe towers from DG1 are almost all back - one is named the same but has a different function and one is removed.  There's a new utility/supplemental/secondary tower type that adds interesting nuance, but requires preplanning which is difficult on the first playthrough.  ...and that's it.  The towers have the same costs, the same 1/3/7 power pattern, pretty much nothing at all that really changes the game.\n\nGraphics are a mixed bag - view can be rotated, the far view is farther back, a lot of the levels are *really pretty*.  But there's something mushier about the towers themselves and the new aliens all seem to be aerodynamic blobs with less character.  You know the iconic big guy monsters from the first game?  No one is going to want to make t-shirts or posters of their replacements.\n\nThere's a lot of discussion about the change to the resource and scoring system.  The big thing to understand is that interest is gone, though efficiency (not spending what you have) does boost score.\n\nResources are accumulated mostly as a simple 10-per-tick drip into your balance, with occasional bonuses when you clear certain waves.  There is no per-creep resource gain.  The result of this is that while levels can still be stressfully tight on resources, the in-level reward/punishment for efficient design is significantly blunted, or at least delayed.  This was needed to some degree, I understand why interest was ultimately such a broken mechanic in DG1.  Still, decoupling available resources almost entirely from build efficiency just feels less satisfying.  Maybe something like a bonus on all ticks when there are no aliens on the map would help, since (the classical TD mechanism of) start-wave-sooner is incompatible with NPCs blabbing at you.\n\nI think I like the scoring, but it's really somewhat bogus that the details are not spelled out anywhere.  I see some good theorycrafting going on in the official forum, while the official post on the subject is just insulting.  The game is complex enough that simply saying "each resource in hand gives .01% bonus, each core at the housing gives 2% bonus, each resource used to build towers gives .001% penalty..." (note - these are not actual values!) isn't going to break anything.  This needn't be done in game, or even game help, but the current explanations are inadequate.  I'd really like the in-game score graph to be zoomed out much farther.\n\nLevel design is good, but not breaking much new ground.  There's some new tech in here where levels can actually change while being played, but it's only used strongly on one level.  Clicking on your spaceship gives you options to tweak all levels a little but the way this is used is nearly an afterthought with the changes usually limited to allowing build on formerly unbuildable grid tiles or really minor terrain movement.  It also does not get strongly introduced in-game.  I suspect I might have missed an early NPC mention, but the first time I heard anything about it was around level 15, long after I had discovered it by accident.\n\nThe last story level is satisfyingly epic, but compared to DG1's finale requires much less creative thought.  This was a pattern throughout the game, where I felt that more-holistic designs generally were less effective than put-the-guns-along-the-path.  The new missile tower could have changed the way one builds these levels, but it's hemmed in by too many line-of-sight restrictions for its range/dps combo to become more than a one-off DPS booster late in a level.  The alien waves also have become less nuanced, with all the aliens listed on the wave chart spawning at the start, with no creative delays or late surprises as was normal on late waves in DG1.  The bonus level types have not added anything meaningful, though there are some tweaked rulesets for more-hardcore play.\n\nI haven't touched multi or custom levels yet.  I am disappointed to see single levels on the Steam Workshop showing up as $2 DLC in the ingame store.  Maybe this is a normal thing, but I can't help but think it's somewhat crass.\n\nSo yeah.  Recommended, even at full price.  There are a lot of disappointments, but (stupid-looking aliens aside) also a good amount of potential here.  At this point it just won't be quite the obsession the first one was.","October 6, 2014","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The addition of different commanders that give you different super weapons is cool. Th new graphics are problematic. Certain towers in DG2 look a lot like other towers in DG. For example, at a quick glance, the DG2 gun tower looks a lot like the DG flame tower. I would have liked it better if they'd modelled the new towers more on the old ones. That would have significantly reduced my learning curve.\n\nI dunno. I kinda feel like this is a DLC that's priced like a full game. So far the only real difference I've noticed is the addition of more super weapons (DG just had the super laser, whil DG2 has a different super weapon for each different character). I'm sure once I play it more I'll see new enemies and new towers, but my first impression is that this is mostly a graphics update and new missions.\n\nI don't like the new touch-oriented interface. It's just okay on my actual touchscreen (DG1 works better with my touchscreen), and if I'm playing on my desktop (no touchscreen), it just makes things awkward. Long story short: the controls don't work well. Touch or not, I frequently have to click things more than once and the graphic that you're supposed to click on rarely lines up with the actual place you need to click to register a command. So I find myself using the mouse to select towers and locations, then using the keyboard to navigate the resulting menu. Even then, I find myself having to hit "enter" more than once very often, and the controls are just overall bad.\n\n\nSo... Yeah. Bottom line: I can't recommend this game. I feel like it takes a lot for me to say "don't play this," but broken controls is pretty much a deal breaker. DG2 would be as good as DG if only the controls worked. But there's not enough new/better (there's really nothing better that I've seen) about it to balance out the fact that the new interface completely breaks the controls.","January 2, 2015","false","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Welcome to Defense Grid 2.\n\nSo I've racked up 11 hours so far and thought I'd leave a reveiw.\n\nThe first game clocked up so many of my hours on steam and xbox (yes I bought it twice) due to the addictive nature of trying to get all of those gold medals. DG2 carries on with this in that you have 20 main story missions and tonnes of challenges to conquer afterwards. The core concepts are still the same, so if you were a fan of the original then this is worthy of your cash.\n\nWhile the games share many similarities, it has a few differences like;\n*Several levels can be altered via your command tower so you can adapt to certain situations\n*End of level drops that can slighty change tower functions eg. slpash damage, target strongest enemy\n*Multiple AI characters which change the function of the orbital laser eg. extra resources, temporal blast\n*No flyers :(\n*Multiplayer and coop\n\nI found the campaign to be quite a bit easier than DG1, though a lot harder than Containment. I found that due to the lack of flying enemies you are able to concentrate more on the ground assault. Hopefully we may see a return with some DLC. The game itself feels good and the graphics are improved, and the dialog will often have you shaking your head yet you will still have a smile on your face.\n\nThis is a worthy purchase for younger members as the concept is easy to pick up, and also for the completionist who must have EVERY GOLD ON THE HARDEST DIFFICULTY EVER! You will also receive DG Architect where you can create your own levels for the Steam Workshop, however this is'nt as simple as you would find on the likes of Cubemen 2. There are already a dozen maps on there now and some look really impressive, so hopefully we will see a lot more on there soon.\n\nOverall a very good game and well worth the dosh.\n8.7/10\n\nNow if you will excuse me there is a Super Grinder that requires my attention.","September 23, 2014","true","36.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The campaign is engaging for a story being only told through dialogue of the familiar Fletcher and brings back many of characters we met in the Containment DLC.\n\nMy only complaint would be that they kept the game so familiar, it would have been nice to see some new towers, maybe an ultimate tower, something that took up more than one space on the board.\n\nFor $25 this game is highly reccomended, the multiple game modes. addition of multiplayer, and mod support will provide hundreds of hours replayability in a game that sets the standard and defines a genre.","September 23, 2014","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have over a hundred hours at it and still sometimes go back to try and complete some of the harder levels. If you like that, then you will like Defense Grid 2 I'm sure.\n\nCurrently there are only 2 missions which u can play, with about 4 different scenarios and difficulties to try out. I'm not going to spoil it but there are some signifigant changes while keeping the same as the DG1. You also only have access to towers that were in DG1 except the Buff Tower which is new but theres plenty of empty area is the tower menu for new towers to come.\n\nI notice in the tower selection they seem to have thier own "inventory/skill" slots so that looks interesting possibly enabling you to tweak your towers to suit your mission or playstyle.\n\nOverall I'd say play the first one if your not sure about the price (allthough, potentially you can get it for free by pre-ordering this), other wise I'd definately reccomend picking this up.","July 24, 2014","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great voice acting, good story (a little more interesting this time around), and solid gameplay. Some levels are set, while others (moreso in the later ones) require pathing, but there are multiple ways to acheive victory. The towers are a little more balanced now - they all have their strengths and building a single tower type is not a good strategy. Inferno is the only tower that seems underpowered, but it's really cheap. You are able to exploit the pathing on some levels to make the mobs go back and forth under your guns, which isn't that fun (but not required, so don't play that way!)\n\nIf you liked the first one, definately get the sequel.

However, strategically, it is beaten to death by its predecessor. All levels are fairly easy and as a last resort all doable by brute force (heavy use of meteor and missile). This is not true for DG1 where you really had to think for most of the levels how to do it.\n\nNevertheless, DG2 is a rocksolid base for our beloved tower defense :). What is much better implemented now is the integration of 3rd party levels and community levels. This is what I heavily rely on and am quite sure, that by spicing this game up with some community extra levels, DG2 will reach the same heights in gameplay and the same level of causing an addiction than DG1 was at its time. Therefore still a thumbs up!\n\n(edit: Just my opinion on the global scoreboard. I think it is pretty safe to assume, that in the very first level, which belongs to the tutorial, it is impossible to gain more than around 125.000 points. First place ranks No. 1 with more than 4 mio. points. That reeks to say the least, which renders the scoreboard system almost useless and needs some refurbishment)","September 28, 2014","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No, it did not have 83 hours of content, but with the original campaign and several DLC packs we were given room to play with. And tweak, fiddle and generally mess around with what was possible. With all the different game modes, you could play each map dozens of times. DG2 gives us all that and more.\n\nWhat's different? - Shiny new graphics! More voiceover artists! New aliens!\n\nThe only "new" tower is the Boost Tower, which goes under other towers. This makes whatever you build on top taller, and you can spend resources to activate a Boost Tower special ability: 25% damage bonus, cloak disruptor, score enhancement, etc. This makes command towers obsolete.\n\nThe other tower change is the missile tower, which now also shoots ground targets.\n\nThere's been some tweaking in the damage outputs, so that guns aren't always the most efficient option.\n\nIs it worth the price? - I was a little unsure about $25, but I've been totally sucked in by DG2.

A few additional features - though in the demo I missed a few of the touches of character that turned DG1 from a great game into one that was unmissable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jerigord/recommended/221540/","Jerigord","Jerigord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jerigord/","465 products in account","I backed the Kickstarter because I was a huge fan of the first Defense Grid. For me, it was the quintissential tower defense experience, so DG2 had a lot to live up to. I'm nearly done with the story campaign and I'd say that it's lived up to my expectations in most areas and exceeded it in others.\n\nMy first concern was whether or not this would be a sufficient departure from the original. There's really only one new tower type, the boost tower. Otherwise, the missile tower has been repurposed, the command tower has been removed entirely, and everything else is the same. Fortunately, they made this work by introducing new strategies in other ways. The boost tower itself can provide buffs and benefits to any tower built upon them and different AIs can be slotted into your orbital laser, completely changing how it works. I quickly fell in love with the new temporal beam that slows all aliens on the screen as it fits my build strategy well.\n\nMy other major concern was the graphics. The first game looked decent, but was nothing special. It was, however, familiar after all this time. I could tell what an enemy was and what it could do at a glance. The new art style was a significant departure, so I had concerns, particularly in the early betas. At release, however, I'm satisfied with how the game looks. Towers and aliens have had some minor changes, but I can still tell what they are. The ability to rotate the camera is a godsend and I make frequent use of it. All in all, I'm quite pleased with the new graphics styles.\n\nIn terms of new additions, I love the ability to change the terrain of the levels through the command shuttle. It gives me even greater control of how I build my defenses. It also lets the level designers do some really sneaky things with the maps that keep you on your toes. The new alien designs are clever and also require some strategic thinking. The regenerators and suppressors are the bane of my defenses right now. As always, there are tons of other game modes, including some really interesting ones suggested by the community. And lastly, I haven't gotten to check out the level store yet, but I'm looking forward to seeing what the community creates.\n\nDefense Grid 2 is a worthy successor to the original and worth every penny I spent on it. I see myself playing this for a long time.","September 24, 2014","true","22.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Welcome to Defense Grid 2.\n\nSo I've racked up 11 hours so far and thought I'd leave a reveiw.\n\nThe first game clocked up so many of my hours on steam and xbox (yes I bought it twice) due to the addictive nature of trying to get all of those gold medals. DG2 carries on with this in that you have 20 main story missions and tonnes of challenges to conquer afterwards. The core concepts are still the same, so if you were a fan of the original then this is worthy of your cash.\n\nWhile the games share many similarities, it has a few differences like;\n*Several levels can be altered via your command tower so you can adapt to certain situations\n*End of level drops that can slighty change tower functions eg. slpash damage, target strongest enemy\n*Multiple AI characters which change the function of the orbital laser eg. extra resources, temporal blast\n*No flyers :(\n*Multiplayer and coop\n\nI found the campaign to be quite a bit easier than DG1, though a lot harder than Containment. I found that due to the lack of flying enemies you are able to concentrate more on the ground assault. Hopefully we may see a return with some DLC. The game itself feels good and the graphics are improved, and the dialog will often have you shaking your head yet you will still have a smile on your face.\n\nThis is a worthy purchase for younger members as the concept is easy to pick up, and also for the completionist who must have EVERY GOLD ON THE HARDEST DIFFICULTY EVER! You will also receive DG Architect where you can create your own levels for the Steam Workshop, however this is'nt as simple as you would find on the likes of Cubemen 2. There are already a dozen maps on there now and some look really impressive, so hopefully we will see a lot more on there soon.\n\nOverall a very good game and well worth the dosh.\n8.7/10\n\nNow if you will excuse me there is a Super Grinder that requires my attention.","September 23, 2014","true","36.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The original revived the Tower Defence genre and also allowed it to take the leap from free flash game over to a full retail release. That was not unwarrented, it oozed charm in it's voice acting and visual simplicity. Thankfully the voice acting is back and indeed expanded with a cast including that Bioware favourite Jennifer Hale and Firefly alum Alan Tudyk, both of which are exactly as excellent as you would expect!\n\nIn the natural expansion that comes with being a sequel there appears to have been a good deal of confusion. Menus are mindbogglingly unintuitive to cycle though, it brings back awful memory of the dashboard that shipped with the Xbox 360 on launch (trust me, it doesn't hold up). There's plenty of game modes that seem well designed and add lots of life to the intrepid builder, but they are quite hard to track in the interface. I think my biggest complaint is that somehow it has done the impossible and has had a visual downgrade between itterations.\n\nAfter a few rounds you get used to the clunkier visuals and settle into the varied and polished gameplay. There's some great length to the campain, expanded by the dozens of variations and challenges per mission, it really does give you some wondeful value if you want to even complete 1/5 of the modes available.\n\nIn summary, while on the surface making something as simple as tower defence work on a larger scale may seem easy, DG2 finds a few of the faults that have defeated some of it's competition but it still exhudes the charm and polished gameplay that made DG1 such a runaway hit. If you want more Defence Grid, here it is!","October 27, 2014","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After 10 hours, you are through the campaign.... and I did not find anything else. The workshop does not allow you to download any maps. They have a store, where you can buy additional maps ( $2 for a single map????). In fact - does steam allow publishers to have their own stores to sell DLC?\n\nFinally, there should be an editor somewhere, but I cannot find it (I assume that it is not included in the mac version).\n\nThe graphics are really great, but they require significant system ressources, at least in the mac version. If you have lots of towers and lots of aliens on the map, the frame rate goes down to about 1 fps. My computer (late 2013 iMac) is not a true gamer pc, but definitely not low end.\n\nFinally, the software quality is awful. The program starts with a (completely superfluous) launcher that crashes at least on every second start attempt. I fixed it by altering the launcher itself, so it starts the game immediately.

The basic concept is the same; there is a path that you place towers along in order to shoot down the aliens that walk along it to steal your cores. This raises several questions. Why is that an alien alliance comprised of several different races are so technilogically advanced they managed to push humanity to the brink of extinction, and yet are so stupid they walk in a path with no attempt to change things up and even though hundreds of their kind were killed before them, none of them bother to bring a weapon to shoot down a tower. After playing this game for a few hours I grow concerned for these poor aliens. Maybe it is I who is pushing them to the brink of extinction...\n\nAnyway, this game is much like the original, but with enough new content to make the game interesting. Each tower has a special affect you can add on before the mission, and I believe you can choose from multiple for each one. You have to unlock them, so to start with you won't have any. For example, the basic gun tower can have the priority target mod added to it, which will make it shoot at the strongest enemy in range rather than its seemingly random choices. These little mods can affect the game a bit, and It's a fun bit of customization. In addition to that you can choose a leader's ability, such as an orbital laser that'll kill about anything in range or an extra resource drop. Each ability takes 5 minutes to cool down. It's no game changer, but it's a little thing that can help if you remember to use it.\n\nI only have two complaints. For one, there is no endless wave match available as far as I can tell, which seems like it could be easily accomplished and would be a lot of fun to play. After someone becomes good enough the grinder waves get boring and you just want to see how far you can make it. Also, if you put the game into fast forward mode after a few seconds the towers will start spinning around and stop shooting at enemies, so only use fast forward when no enemies are in range. It sucks, and I hope the developers fix the problem.\n\nOverall, the game is enjoyable, and for its price a great buy. There's even multiplayer now, which I've yet to try.","March 6, 2015","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So the question is....how does the sequel hold up?\n\nThe short answer is: Not as well as the original.\n\nOn the other hand Defense Grid 2 is still a fun game.  It follows all of the tower defense tropes as expected.  A variety of towers.  Upgradable.  Place them to best abuse the map layout while killing as many aliens as possible.\n\nThere is a story like in the original but this time you have a lot of new AIs joining your crew with their own quirks.  Each also offers an alternative special weapon such as a resource gathering laser or the ability to control what the towers target.  Most of the new AIs don't get enough time to be throroughly developed with one exception, but still it allows a lot of fun interaction between them.\n\nNow where the changes have happened.  First there are no longer flying aliens with their alternate routes.  Overall this makes things a bit easier as you're not worrying about them.  The missle tower is now basically a cannon tower on steroids.  Even more firepower with greater range but even a slower rate of fire.\n\nCommand towers are gone.  Instead you can upgrade boost towers which you place a normal tower on.  The upgrade choices are disrupter(reveals stealth, turns off shields on nearby enemies), score boost(does exactly what it says), and overcharge(ups tower damage by 25%).  This also helps make things easier as disrupter is really good meaning certain towers just aren't necessary(notably the Tesla tower which is the main anti-shield tower.  Why use it when you can just upgrade another tower with a disrupter?).\n\nThere are unlockable upgrades that you get by beating levels.  These are handed out randomly sometimes when you beat a level with higher difficulty increasing your chance of a reward.  Most of them make your towers better at no cost so if you're having trouble with a level, these can definitely make things easier for you.  For example there's a temporal missle reward that causes your missle tower to heavily slow an enemy as well as doing heavy damage to it.  You can only have one of these upgrades assigned to a specific tower at a time and it applies to all copies of the tower you make.\n\nThe aliens are mostly the ones you know from the original although a few new ones have been added and some older ones have had small changes in how they do things.  And the fliers as noted before are gone.\n\n\nOverall Defense Grid 2 is a fun game with the AIs giving it some personality if perhaps a bit too easy due to certain easily exploited mechanics.  Definitely worth adding to your collection if you're a fan of the genre but if you don't like the genre there's nothing here that's going to change your mind.","November 13, 2015","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hidden Path seems to have had other ideas in mind, such as charging players for player created content, minimizing replayability (If it were not for the achievements i would not of put as much time into this game as i did) and overall creating a bland experience.\n\nThe multiplayer scene of this game is literally non-existent. There is nobody that plays this online. There is no new content for this game coming out and it seems it has just kind of been abandoned for other things, which seems to be a trend for Hidden Path.\n\nOh, but WAIT! NOW they are bringing Defense Grid 2 to the Oculus rift! Why, might you ask? Probably for a cash in. They say the graphics are going to be better, this and that, we'll be able to see the monsters better.. Its all a load of horse crap. I love tower defenses, but please stop supporting companies like this that just make generic games and then offload them so they can start on their next offload project.\n\nI did get some enjoyment out of this, but once you realize you are literally the only person on steam playing this, it becomes increasingly boring and just..

It also happens to be one of the most visually pleasing ones. I don't think much of the story though, it is kind of 'meh'. But you are not playing these kind of games for a story anyway (I hope :) ) you play it as a nice distraction, and somewhat challenging puzzles. Although for me personally, this game isn't really hard. It is a nice thing to play when I got nothing to do, and want a bit of fun. And for this, the game certainly delivers. On the negative side though, I find the UI at places, quite 'busy'. And even confusing at places. Looks more like a section of a magazine, than a useful UI really. And the campaign, seems to be mixed up with disconnected levels? I can't really tell, and that isn't really good. A campaign should have a clear progession. But that is not to say I think the levels themselves are bad.. they are not. I am saying the UI layout is messed up.\n\nUpdate: Well.. finally I finished this game. While I still recommend it, what I previously said is still true. UI is very messy and illogical. The story is really quite 'meh'. But the game is fun, albeit some levels are really too easy. The balance of progression is not stable, and you'll find some incredibly easy levels, where the game actually should be more difficult to play.

Come on, be a big kid.\n\nDefense Grid 1 has got to be one of my favorite games of all time. I had it for Xbox 360, and on one of the challenge levels I accidentally tied for top score on the entire leaderboard during a warm-up. Instantly this game became something special to me, and when I found out about the sequel, I jumped for joy motionlessly in my chair. I did what any regular person does at this point, and completely forgot about it. Built myself a desktop recently, and got back into PC gaming (don't know why the ♥♥♥♥ I didn't do this sooner). I found this game and became overjoyed, and went to go buy a Steam card (N1gg@s get shifty when you use your card), got back home, got stoned, and fell asleep. Out of some miracle, it was on sale the next day, and very quickly it got me to space on homework and now I have to rush last second constantly, but it's so worth it.\n\nGameplay doesn't seem much different than the first, but there are some welcome additions! I wouldn't have wanted it any other way honestly. There's plenty of challenges for each level, and the menu is clearly set up to show all your medals on each of the difficulties you've completed. Boost towers are just plain unfair if used right, and the missile towers are much better than before.

In the two expansions, this same mechanic was carried forward, but with first one new character (GlaDOS , first, then Kai and Simon).

So, instead of being your "weapon of last resort" as in the first game, these become "tricks to get more resources" or the like.\n\nAnother "downgrade" is that the aliens from the first game were, franklly, very visually distinctive.  In this game, they (although in most cases carring the same names as in the first game) look entirely different...  and the redesigned aliens are now no longer visually distinctive.  They all look like they're part of the same species, sure, but they all look very much alike now.\n\nThen you have the distracting "heat and path indicators" which just serve to obscure the visuals.  And the list goes on and on.\n\nFinally, I have to point out, the game is much more resource-intensive than the first game, and yet if anything it doesn't look quite as nice as that first game does.\n\nThis is actually a decent game...  and if it had been written by someone else, attempting to compete with the first Defense Grid while not totally copying it, I'd be much more favorable with my analysis.  But in this case, it seems that the developer team decided to "compete with the first game while not being the same."  This was a risky choice, and one which didn't really pan out well for them.\n\nIf you get only one game... get the first game, which is far superior to this sequel.  But if you can get both, by all means, do so.  This game is a decent game, it's just a "downgrade" from the nearly perfect "Defense Grid - The Awakening."","June 23, 2015","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really enjoyed DG1 and it was a lot more challenging. There's only one new tower in this game over DG1, the Boost tower. You'll hear how special it is every time you build one. Pretty much the same strategy works on every map. Place AoE towers near the front to weed out the swarmers, then put the powerful single targetting stuff in the back. Sprinkle temporal towers about and you win.\n\nThere's no flying enemies like in DG1. There are some new types of aliens to blow up, but they don't add any extra challenge. For example, aliens that heal themselves, so just make sure they die quickly, which you will want to do with all the aliens anyway.\n\nAnd they talk about raspberries the whole dang time. In DG1, it was something he mentioned a couple of times as a joke, but you hear it on every map in DG2. It gets old really quick.\n\nI find it hard to recommend this game.

I don't review many games but DG1 deserved a positive review. With DG2 I was a bit uncertain. I downloaded the demo and found the opening interface very different. I also noticed the graphics was a bit more sluggish and found the towers a bit more challenging to differentiate than DG1. But that is easily fixed by notching the detail level down. It doesn't materially impact gameplay.\n\nSteam recently had a 75% sale and I couldn't resist anymore. I am happy to report that DG2 is very enjoyable and I am quite happy I purchased it. There are enough differences in DG2 to make it worthwhile for the upgrade. You don't have to have DG1 experience to play but it is nice to see where DG2 came from.  I recommend people get BOTH games.\n\nIn DG2, I really like the addition of the Boost tower. In DG1, players are forced to buy guns to shape paths but it was "often wasted" resource because upgrading them didn't provide strategic value. The Boost tower is perfect for shaping paths.\n\nThe Missile tower in DG2 has been changed to become an attack unit against land aliens between the Cannon and Meteor towers. In fact, there are no aerial units in D♥♥♥♥s it was in DG1. I have mixed feelings about this. In some ways, it makes DG2 easier without having to contend the aerial units. I think Hidden Path needs to bring the aerial units back again.\n\nI have attempted to play multi-player but haven't been able to find anyone in the multi-player search function. I guess I will have to find someone I know to play it with.\n\nHidden Path has not provided much news on the future of DG2.  The Hidden Path store has some .99 maps designed by devoted players and approved for sale by Hidden Path.  But it would be nice to have some DLC packs. Having said that, there are many free maps created and designed by fans to play. Unfortunately, it is a bit cumbersome unless you are somewhat technical-oriented.  Non-technical people will be forced to pay for store maps.\n\nOverall, I am big fan of both DG games. Hidden Path needs to release more information or news on the future of DG2 or it will languish. I have read some of the negative reviews and some of the complaints are just offbase to me.  People are overly-critical of DG2. Hidden Path has reduced the price and if you get a 75% Steam sale, it is simply a no-brainer to get it.\n","September 7, 2015","true","101.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Improvements over the original edition were the incorporation of aspects of the “Command Tower” into the Boost tower.  The Boost tower does add a bit more of nuance then the original edition.  Initial maze creation is less costly with the Boost towers, and careful placement of the Boost tower is still essential in winning the game.   If you’ve played the extended versions of the original DG, you’ll find that you will quickly be able to excel at this version.  While the Orbital Laser was the only choice of off-world help in the original edition, DG2 does a very good job in expanding the options to allow tower boosts, resource (money) boost, and more.  Some levels are well suited to these new options, where the Orbital Laser would have been over-kill or less challenging if used.\nWell worth the money, and even better if reduced via a Steam sale price :)\n","December 30, 2014","true","76.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It allows mazing and damage boosts to towers.\n-As you progress through the story, your towers acquire items that can give and take from the tower's original damage/function.\n-You can now select different AIs for different command functions.  Orbital laser's on the first one, other command functions (including a laser that boosts your towers' damage output for a period of time!) are TOTALLY viable.\n-They imported the old scoring system, so you have the option of having the DG1 resource accumulation.\n-There's frickin' multiplayer, man.\n\nLots of reviews say there's more mazing in these maps, which to be honest, I'm hoping that comes out a bit more in the later maps.

Often the 'plot' is string-thin if even present and the mechanics are often a sticking point. Defense Grid 2 helps justify its existence by having a fairly solid if modest narrative and a colorful cast of characters with a fairly lame but at least present story.\n\nThe gameplay is simple and can at times require a few retries to get a level down just right. Getting a high score can be fun and challenging, but the game doesn't pick up in true difficulty until Hard difficulty. Even then, hardcore fans of the first game may be disappointed in the comparatively more gradual curve, the sometimes outright random level difficulty (some missions you can do with say, a few gun towers in one spot, while others are really hard suddenly), and the loss of flying units.\n\nBasically, this game is more accessable then its predecessor when it comes to new players. I really love this series and would love to see more added to this game- but uh, right now I don't know if it's worth the ~20 usd that they are charging. It's a gem in terms of some character points (namely in regards to Memory and Arteficial Longevity), but the gameplay is essentially OK.\n\nCOOP is really fun, it makes for a pleasent time killer and I found that collaborating on tower placement tended to work well- and on some of the larger maps it's pretty much a guarenteed win to have two players handling towers up front and in back. Still, I caught the game on sale for about 3-4 dollars and feel satisfied with it. Sadly, I'm not sure this series has enough to offer for its price as of present.","September 10, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The ability to add abilities to your towers and pick what abilities your Commander has going into each mission is a nice tweak to an awesome title.

I don't review many games but DG1 deserved a positive review. With DG2 I was a bit uncertain. I downloaded the demo and found the opening interface very different. I also noticed the graphics was a bit more sluggish and found the towers a bit more challenging to differentiate than DG1. But that is easily fixed by notching the detail level down. It doesn't materially impact gameplay.\n\nSteam recently had a 75% sale and I couldn't resist anymore. I am happy to report that DG2 is very enjoyable and I am quite happy I purchased it. There are enough differences in DG2 to make it worthwhile for the upgrade. You don't have to have DG1 experience to play but it is nice to see where DG2 came from.  I recommend people get BOTH games.\n\nIn DG2, I really like the addition of the Boost tower. In DG1, players are forced to buy guns to shape paths but it was "often wasted" resource because upgrading them didn't provide strategic value. The Boost tower is perfect for shaping paths.\n\nThe Missile tower in DG2 has been changed to become an attack unit against land aliens between the Cannon and Meteor towers. In fact, there are no aerial units in D♥♥♥♥s it was in DG1. I have mixed feelings about this. In some ways, it makes DG2 easier without having to contend the aerial units. I think Hidden Path needs to bring the aerial units back again.\n\nI have attempted to play multi-player but haven't been able to find anyone in the multi-player search function. I guess I will have to find someone I know to play it with.\n\nHidden Path has not provided much news on the future of DG2.  The Hidden Path store has some .99 maps designed by devoted players and approved for sale by Hidden Path.  But it would be nice to have some DLC packs. Having said that, there are many free maps created and designed by fans to play. Unfortunately, it is a bit cumbersome unless you are somewhat technical-oriented.  Non-technical people will be forced to pay for store maps.\n\nOverall, I am big fan of both DG games. Hidden Path needs to release more information or news on the future of DG2 or it will languish. I have read some of the negative reviews and some of the complaints are just offbase to me.  People are overly-critical of DG2. Hidden Path has reduced the price and if you get a 75% Steam sale, it is simply a no-brainer to get it.\n","September 7, 2015","true","101.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Often the 'plot' is string-thin if even present and the mechanics are often a sticking point. Defense Grid 2 helps justify its existence by having a fairly solid if modest narrative and a colorful cast of characters with a fairly lame but at least present story.\n\nThe gameplay is simple and can at times require a few retries to get a level down just right. Getting a high score can be fun and challenging, but the game doesn't pick up in true difficulty until Hard difficulty. Even then, hardcore fans of the first game may be disappointed in the comparatively more gradual curve, the sometimes outright random level difficulty (some missions you can do with say, a few gun towers in one spot, while others are really hard suddenly), and the loss of flying units.\n\nBasically, this game is more accessable then its predecessor when it comes to new players. I really love this series and would love to see more added to this game- but uh, right now I don't know if it's worth the ~20 usd that they are charging. It's a gem in terms of some character points (namely in regards to Memory and Arteficial Longevity), but the gameplay is essentially OK.\n\nCOOP is really fun, it makes for a pleasent time killer and I found that collaborating on tower placement tended to work well- and on some of the larger maps it's pretty much a guarenteed win to have two players handling towers up front and in back. Still, I caught the game on sale for about 3-4 dollars and feel satisfied with it. Sadly, I'm not sure this series has enough to offer for its price as of present.","September 10, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is no new content for this game coming out and it seems it has just kind of been abandoned for other things, which seems to be a trend for Hidden Path.\n\nOh, but WAIT! NOW they are bringing Defense Grid 2 to the Oculus rift! Why, might you ask? Probably for a cash in. They say the graphics are going to be better, this and that, we'll be able to see the monsters better.. Its all a load of horse crap. I love tower defenses, but please stop supporting companies like this that just make generic games and then offload them so they can start on their next offload project.\n\nI did get some enjoyment out of this, but once you realize you are literally the only person on steam playing this, it becomes increasingly boring and just.. Blah. This might of been worth our time, had Hidden Path actually put a substantial amount of theirs into it. I think i bought this game for like.. $16, without even reading any reviews, just because i love TD's that much.. But it was a mistake overall. Don't be that guy. Read the reviews, don't support this bullcrap in our treasured gaming community.","November 14, 2015","false","65.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So the question is....how does the sequel hold up?\n\nThe short answer is: Not as well as the original.\n\nOn the other hand Defense Grid 2 is still a fun game.  It follows all of the tower defense tropes as expected.  A variety of towers.  Upgradable.  Place them to best abuse the map layout while killing as many aliens as possible.\n\nThere is a story like in the original but this time you have a lot of new AIs joining your crew with their own quirks.  Each also offers an alternative special weapon such as a resource gathering laser or the ability to control what the towers target.  Most of the new AIs don't get enough time to be throroughly developed with one exception, but still it allows a lot of fun interaction between them.\n\nNow where the changes have happened.  First there are no longer flying aliens with their alternate routes.  Overall this makes things a bit easier as you're not worrying about them.  The missle tower is now basically a cannon tower on steroids.  Even more firepower with greater range but even a slower rate of fire.\n\nCommand towers are gone.  Instead you can upgrade boost towers which you place a normal tower on.  The upgrade choices are disrupter(reveals stealth, turns off shields on nearby enemies), score boost(does exactly what it says), and overcharge(ups tower damage by 25%).  This also helps make things easier as disrupter is really good meaning certain towers just aren't necessary(notably the Tesla tower which is the main anti-shield tower.  Why use it when you can just upgrade another tower with a disrupter?).\n\nThere are unlockable upgrades that you get by beating levels.  These are handed out randomly sometimes when you beat a level with higher difficulty increasing your chance of a reward.  Most of them make your towers better at no cost so if you're having trouble with a level, these can definitely make things easier for you.  For example there's a temporal missle reward that causes your missle tower to heavily slow an enemy as well as doing heavy damage to it.  You can only have one of these upgrades assigned to a specific tower at a time and it applies to all copies of the tower you make.\n\nThe aliens are mostly the ones you know from the original although a few new ones have been added and some older ones have had small changes in how they do things.  And the fliers as noted before are gone.\n\n\nOverall Defense Grid 2 is a fun game with the AIs giving it some personality if perhaps a bit too easy due to certain easily exploited mechanics.  Definitely worth adding to your collection if you're a fan of the genre but if you don't like the genre there's nothing here that's going to change your mind.","November 13, 2015","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like the game, just as I did DG1.  But, the content is just not large.  There are 5 chapters with 4 maps each (20 total).  There are numerous game modes and options, such as the ability to equip towers with various extra passives to increase damage or focus tougher enemies.  The single player experience was fine, but rather short.  I have more content to go through and have only beat the game on normal and tried out a few of the game modes, such as the 100 wave survival, but am at 7 hours; I highly doubt the game could get me over 40 hours of game play even if I exhausted everthing.\n\nMultiplayer looks awesome!  I would love to co-op through some tower defense levels.  However, the multiplayer is completely dead.  I waited in queue for 45 mins the other night and was disconnected from the game server when the match was finally found.  I have posted on the steam forums to find a partner or group of players, but my time would be much better spent playing other games.\n\ntl;dr The game is fine, but relatively low on content so buy on sale.  Multiplayer seems cool but doesn't work without direct steam invites.","June 29, 2015","true","17.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
