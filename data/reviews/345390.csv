Those familiar with Telltale Game's adventure titles will probably feel comfortable right away as the control scheme is somewhat similar. The only time you will be using your mouse (unless you're playing with a controller) is to select items in your inventory or to aim with your bow.\n\nThere is a number of action sequences that will require you to dodge obstacles or respond to quick time events. Fortunately they're sparse enough that they don't distract too much from the adventure.\n\nYou play the role of young Graham, acting out his past adventures as the old king narrates the story along with your progress or failures, as he's telling the tales of his youth to his granddaughter. If you get yourself killed, the king will mention that's what would have happened if he had pursued that course of action, then you're brought back moments earlier and can pick back up.\n\nHow does it fare?\nThe game look pretty good and the graphics have a certain charm to them. The voice acting is top notch and really bring some depth to the characters. There's a lot of humor and some charming puns along the way.\n\nThe first episode gave me about 6 hours of game play to completion. Most puzzles are logical but a tad on the easy side. Don't expect to be scratching your head much at what to do next. Most puzzles can be solved in more than one way and there's no way to put yourself in a situation where you can't complete the game.\n\nThe story is somewhat linear and achievement hunters might have to go through it more than once as there's a lot of hidden achievements and many of them are easily missable with no way to get back to them once you've moved past the part of the storyline where you can get them. You can still expect a bit of back tracking as you search for items or for clues about what to do next.\n\nSo far, the game stands pretty well on it's own and is a decent addition to the King's Quest franchise. Die-hard King's Quest fans may be disappointed to see the game strayed a bit from it's roots and that it's not nearly as challenging as the olden titles.\n\nThe good\nBeautiful graphics\nTop-notch voice acting\nMultiple ways to solve puzzles\nThe game acknowledges your choices and adjust dialogues accordingly\nInteresting story with a lot of humor\nDecent episode length\nCan be played just as well with a controller than with the keyboard and mouse\nThe bad\nThere is no way to skip the dialogues and animations\nSome of the action sequences somewhat break the pace of the game\nWhen you die, or fail an event, you have to go through way too much story before you can try again\nThe interface might feel a bit dumbed down to experienced adventure players\nThe ugly\nWait! Didn't you just said you liked the game? What's with the negative review then?\n\nThe reason why I can't give a positive review for the game at this time, is because unless you bought The Complete Collection, there is no way to get the game's last part. Sierra has confirmed on Twitter that the epilogue is exclusive to The Complete Edition and they have no intention to release it separately.\n\nFurthermore, from the moment you have Episode 1 in your library, you can no longer purchase The Complete Edition as you're considered to be owning it already. And adding the Season Pass will not provide you with the full content. Unless you bought the whole thing right away, you get cheated out of the last part of the game.\n\nShould I buy it then?\nIf you're a fan of modern adventure games, this one is definitely worth it. However, if you care about getting the whole content, wait until you can afford to buy The Complete Collection.","September 23, 2015","false","8.6"," 1,014 of 1,156 people (88%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","88","014","1","20","71"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dromel/recommended/345390/","dromel","Garenas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dromel/","106 products in account","ok, so I was worried briefly. the game was unbelievably charming in terms of art and animation, and the music is out-of-this-world perfect. but it seemed more like a tribute to King's Quest than an actual game. and it was completely linear. when I got to what I thought was the end of the episode I was a little excited for the next episode in the graphic novel but felt ripped off.\n\nthen, instead of ending on a cliffhanger like I expected, the game transferred immediately over to another (entirely original) King's Quest story, with an open world, relevant backtracking, an inventory with items you can use (often in useless ways and with funny narrator reactions,) and loads of new characters and original jokes. I'm only just starting the post-intro, but I absolutely love this game so far. the intro alone had me filled with emotion and the prospect of a full game ahead is exciting. I'll update the review after I complete the game, but as of now it's a big recommendation for fans of the original King's Quest.\n\nabout 6 hours of steady gameplay later, I'm completely overwhelmed with how this game came together. all the voice acting, character development, quests, and even deaths were so true-to-source that I couldn't believe Roberta and Ken weren't actively involved in the writing and direction. the music continued to match every scene, both cutscene and gameplay environment, in a totally enchanting and immersive way. all of the different ways to solve quests, and even the order I was able to do them in, gave me that long-lost desire to replay the game not because I want to get a different ending or achievements, but because I want to see all the ways the story could play out if I made slightly different choices. from what I can tell, there are tons unique lines of dialogue based on your choices at key moments, and there are a more than a few minor choices with individually humorous outcomes that I honestly want to see all the iterations of. I know for a fact that I missed a few key easter eggs and side quests, but the prospect of going back for them is exciting, not frustrating like it would be in a game like Mass Effect or Fable. there's even at least one side quest that you can pretty easily 'screw up' accidentally and irreperably (in classic adventure game fashion,) but it felt right to have that in the game. I do not often find myself emotionally attached to a game, especially a short one, but I found myself welling up at several points, a little bit because of how sad a few points are, but mostly because of the powerful and genuine emotion that is displayed through some of the scenes and dialogue.\n\nthe King's Quest games were the first video games I ever found myself really interested in. over the years there have been several reboots and fan projects that have tried to recapture that original charm but none have done it for me, until now. coming from a long-time adventure game and King's Quest aficionado, this game is the real deal. if you're a casual puzzle gamer, a story-driven gamer, an art/music-driven gamer, or someone with even a passing interest in classic adventure games, you're doing yourself a disservice if you don't play this game. and if you're already a fan of King's Quest, you're in for a huge treat.","July 28, 2015","true","22.3"," 388 of 442 people (88%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","88","388","442","18","8"

I thought it was beautiful, charming and witty. It's not a difficult game  by any means, the puzzles are quite logical and the story is quite engaging, so far. Zero complains about the game itself, if you like graphic adventures, do yourself a favor and buy this game.\n\nHowever, and this is the reason for my negative review, there is one important aspect to consider when buying it. If, like me, you want to try the game and you only buy the first chapter thinking that you can get the rest as they come, think again. If you do that, you won't be able to access the epilogue of the game, an extra chapter reserved only for those who pay for the whole thing upfront. I understand that this is Sierra's way to incentivize customers to pay the $39.99 and locjk the sale but, what about those of us who tried and actually liked it? Can we not get the epilogue? Well, unless you pay $39.99 to buy the game again on top of the $9.99 you paid for the first chapter, you can't.  I would really like to be able to access the whole experience without having to pay $49, but I guess I won't be able to.","September 13, 2015","false","7.3"," 172 of 208 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","172","208","4","0"

Having played the original series when it was released, I was looking forward to the game. Be warned, I'm an ancient gamer (ancient as in I started my computing on punch card machines) and I'm a huge fan of adventure games. If that bias isn't your thing, you might be happier finding something else to read. Also note, the game is an eposidic release so this is just the prologue and Chapter 1!\n\nThe mechanics of the game are quite good. The graphics are overall very good and in some cases stunning. The music is spot on and the voice work is superb (given the cast, no surprises there).  I am the universe's sorriest controller user yet I had only minimal trouble using the controller. I am not a fan of the whole WASD thing so I broke down and got a controller for the machine. My kids enjoy having a good laugh watching me try and use it. I did find a couple of times where the character would get stuck in the corner. I would then exit back to the main menu and start over. That was a tad annoying. If I had any complaint on the mechanics it was one I've read elsewhere: "WHERE IS A MAP SO WE DON'T HAVE TO KEEP WALKING (SLOWLY) OVER THE SAME GROUNDS AGAIN AND AGAIN?" Yes, you do a lot of back and forth in the game but the old favorites of teleport stones, magic maps, or even a disgusting taxi are no where to be seen.  From what I have seen on Facebook, the gang at The Odd Gentlemen recognize that this needs fixed in the final four chapters.\n\nThe game trips down the lane of nostolgia by opening up with Sir Graham retreiving the fabled magic mirror of King's Quest I. It is an interesting retelling and it does set up the story to come but I wasn't too thrilled with solving puzzles by spinning wheels and shooting objects out of the way. I played the first three Call of Duty games and enjoyed them but I don't think I need the tatics mucking about my adventure games. Oh well, must be that old thing again. Still, shoot some stuff, jump around some stuff and solve a couple of very mild puzzles and the prologue is completed.\n\nFor Chapter 1, Graham has to perform three tasks (why is it always three?) to become a mighty pirate. Scratch that, to become a knight.  King's Quest does play like Guybrush Threepwood had he starred in the film "The Princess Bride".  Some of the scenes are lifted nearly verbatim from the film. The completion of the tasks (and all the side tasks you need to perform) is the stuff of classic adventure games and works quite well although the puzzles are not very difficult once you find all the pieces. There is a puzzle in the dragon's cave involving tying a rope around the dragon's tail that was quite good. But this is 2015 so of course there are a couple of sequences involving lots of shooting of obstacles (or goblins) and my pathetic controller skills were stretched. My 15 year old plowed through them with ease. I'll have to replay to see if the first two tasks have to be played in the order I played them (I'm guessing yes but I haven't tried yet and I have a couple of ideas how it could work) but the game appears to be pretty linear. I looked up a couple of play throughs and I see some folks tackled the side quests in a different order than I did but that was about it. That is a bit of a sad departure from the original series where you really could tackle the big tasks one at a time and more or less in any order or work on them as a group.\n\nWhy this review is a yes vote: It is a new take on the adventure game format and it shows promise. There was some nice character development for Graham (there are a couple of serious moments) and with some clean up work on moving around the map and skipping dialogue, the game could be far more enjoyable. Chapter 1 isn't perfect, but it is a nice return to some familiar and new characters in a land that holds fond memories for many of us. The voice work and music and the background scenery show the developers have a lot of the big pieces in place. The writing, while not fantastic, was better than most and while it is not  a Roberta Williams game, they have shown they have a lot of love and respect for the original. I bought the season pass so I'm in this one for the long haul. Thus far, I'm glad to be along for the ride.","August 2, 2015","true","68.0"," 70 of 86 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","70","86","5","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arcanumzero/recommended/345390/","arcanumzero","arcanum.zero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arcanumzero/","372 products in account","Let's get this out of the way first: I, too, am disappointed about the Epilogue fiasco.  Sierra, we're not asking for a handout, we want to give you our money.  Let us buy the Epilogue individually.\n\nBut I think giving this game a thumbs down in reaction to some bad marketing is an unfortunate overreaction.  This game is uniformly excellent.  I bought the first episode on sale expecting to hate it, and knowing it would be nothing like the games I loved as a child.\n\nI was right on the second point but dead wrong on the first.  Although King's Quest (2015) plays like a modern adventure game and not like the classics fans remember, this is not a terrible thing.  It could have been, given how awful most modern adventure games are, but a great deal of care went into its design.  The story is intricate and fascinating, dropping tidbits for old fans while still being intriguing to new ones.\n\nThe replay value of this title is off the charts, not only because of the story elements you will miss the first time through and gasp at when you see them for the second time with greater understanding, but because of the degree to which your choices unlock different events in the game.  I've seen this downplayed, and I don't know why -- the changes to the story experience of King's Quest based on player choice are substantial.\n\nThe thing that impresses me the most is how non-linear the game can be at times  -- despite the inherent linearity of the genre (get red herring, trade red herring for macguffin, trade macguffin for foozle), the developer succeeds at allowing the player to drive the order of events.  Quite a feat!\n\nThe story is not perfect -- while the game does try to minimize walking repeatedly through the same area over and over again, it does not do this consistently.  Like all adventure games there's a lot of walking back and forth in this title.  Also, while I remember the old King's Quest games having a pretty dry sense of humor, this version relies very heavily on slapstick.  If I have one big complaint with the story of the new King's Quest it is this:\n\nKing Graham is not, and was never, Guybrush Threepwood.\n\nWhile the developers obviously had a lot of respect for the King's Quest source material, they missed the mark on Graham's characterization.  Perhaps he will mature in later chapters.\n\nKing's Quest's puzzles are /genuinely challenging/, not illogical or fiddly, and while the game does fall somewhat short of being actually difficult (I've only had to cheat once in two chapters), this is not a bad thing because of another chink in its armor:\n\nYou can't restore previous saved games.\n\nOuch.  I know what The Odd Gentlemen were thinking -- they want to get an honest first-run story arc out of us players, not one perfected through trial and error.  To them I say this: get over yourselves.  You're making the game for us.  If you want to tell a story without interruption, write a novel.  This is the age of the internet -- if we want a perfect playthrough we are going to get one, and if we don't, we are going to intentionally make bad choices whether we can restore save games or not.  Patch this functionality in!\n\nIn short, this game is fantastic.  It could be a little less goofy, and the developer and publisher could have considered the desires of the fans a bit more, but I am excitedly waiting for Chapters 3 through 5.  I expect to play this game repeatedly, well into the future, but I exhort other developers to follow the lead of the Odd Gentlemen, and give me more of the same!  And to you adventure game developers who are not willing to put this level of effort into story and gameplay design, I say this: get new jobs.

"Sierra".\n\nLucas Arts might have wowed the gaming crowd with Islands of Monkeys and Days of Tentacles, but Sierra was there first, they're credited with releasing the first computer adventure game to feature graphics (well monochrome line drawings accompanying the text) but it was an achievement and laid the way to several great Sierra games including two of the greatest gaming franchises from the "days of yore" Space Quest and Kings Quest.\nWhilst Space Quest is sadly still waiting for a reboot (I miss you Roger Wilco),\nI'm happy to report that Kings Quest is back... and this time it's episodic!\n\n\nGreat Scott!\n\nThis "Re-imagining" of Kings Quest is available in five episodes and delivered as a story told by old King Graham about his youth, his adventures and his eventful past.\n\nHave you ever seen the movie "The Princess Bride"? (If not you should, it's a classic!)\n\nAnyway, the format of Kings Quest is very similar to that movie, just replace Columbo with Doc Brown from "Back to the Future" and you're there.\nThat's right, Kings Quest is narrated by the wonderful Christopher Lloyd, his engaging voice giving life to Old King Graham as he recounts his adventures to his granddaughter Gwendolyn.\n\nThis re-telling of Kings Quest also moves away (just a little) from its point and click roots. It's still an adventure game, you'll explore the Kingdom, hunt for items and solve puzzles, but this time you have direct control of Graham as he quests around and interacts with the people of Daventry. (I played the game with an Xbox controller and it worked great!)\n\n\nThat's not what I did!\n\nDeath in Kings Quest comes along now and then but it isn't an obstacle, instead it adds an extra layer of humour to an already amusing game whilst playing on the story telling narrative.\n\nShould you manage to get yourself gobbled up by a beastie or crisped to a cinder by a dragon you'll be treated to a witty narration saying something along the lines of "and that's what would have happened if I'd done that..." before the game jumps back to the moments before your death so you can make a different choice.\n\nIt makes you smile and keeps the game flowing pretty smoothly.\n\n\nA Knight to Remember\n\nEpisode One takes us back to Daventry as we follow Graham as teenage wannabe knight arriving in the Kingdom for the first time.\nA knights tournament is about to take place, all Graham needs is an entry ticket and a way to get to the Tournament Theatre (Daventry is having "bridge issues" so that isn't as easy as you might think) but this is just the beginning of Grahams problems.\n\nThere's a chivalry test to pass and an initiation quest to complete before he can even compete in the three main trails of strength, speed and Wits to become a real knight of Daventry.\nThe game plays out in true adventure style as you hunt for items to help you overcome the various challenges the tournament presents.\n\nYou'll be talking to the locals, competing against (and joining forces with) other knight hopefuls and combining inventory objects just like the good old point and click games of yester-year.\n\n\nPretty Punny\n\nThere are different solutions to many of the puzzles too, the branching conversations are witty and well written and the puns are so bad they go beyond terrible and come out the other side, the side which makes you smile at their awfulness.\n\nAs Gwendolyn states herself during the narrative with "Old Graham" the puns start to grow on you.\n\nWhilst the bulk of the story takes place in the retelling of events from Grahams past, we are treated to the odd cut scene set in the "present" revolving around old King Graham and the lives of his grandchildren. These intriguing snippets do a great job of weaving a separate storyline into the narrative and breaking up the knightly shenanigans of the past.\n\nGraphically it's perfectly pretty with colourful and well animated cartoon style visuals.\nGrahams cloak fluttering around behind him as he moves is a very nice touch.\n\nThe hand drawn art style makes each scene look special, It often feels like playing through a quality Disney movie and for an animated title I can't think of higher praise than that.\n\n\nKnightly Chatter\n\nI've already mentioned the great work Christopher Lloyd does as the voice of the old king but credit should also be given to the other vocal talents in the game.\n\nThe standard of voice acting across the board is very high, there's no weak link here, all the characters in Daventry feel.... well... full of character.\n\n\nIt's Gonna Be A Long Knight\n\nWith a Royal Lineage dating back to the early 80's, The Kings Quest franchise has been around for a long, long time.\nThis episodic return of the game is not only welcome but surprisingly good.\nYou don't need to be familiar with the previous titles either, everything you need to know is encapsulated within the game.\n\nAs an episodic title it's longer than you'd expect too, the first episode clocks in at over 6 hours which is way better than the 2 hours of content I've come to expect from other episodic titles.\n\nKings Quest: A Knight to Remember is an entertaining tale with interesting puzzles, great voice work and beautifully hand drawn visuals.\nThe reboot of Kings Quest is off to a flying start.\n\nFamily friendly gaming at its best!\n\n\nFor the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/kings-quest-review.html","September 13, 2015","true","9.1"," 34 of 41 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","34","41","2","0"

Not anymore, Cedric. Not anymore. Someone has finally heard our prayers.\n\nAs a young girl growing up in the 80's, this was my JAM! These games shaped my taste for adventure and escape in computer games. I was tickled pink to see they were finally remaking this with a budget over $500 dollars and a taco dinner.\n\nFive minutes into the game and it felt "right." The quests seemed like a wink at the originals. The art never strayed too far from the path Kings Quest was on either. The story is a clever take on a remake, sure to keep the nerds at bay while they search for plot holes. The characters are instantly likable and the quests are easy enough to not enrage you while still challenging you to think a bit.\n\nThat being said, I was never stumped at any point of the game. I have not made up my mind if I miss impossible quests or not. There is something to be said about the challenge that the old games presented. I got in A LOT of trouble calling that Sierra hotline. I'm a bit saddened that today's youth will never experience that sort of nerdrage followed by cheating, followed even closer by family shame.\n\nThis game brought back the feeling that I had playing the "newest" King's Quests as a kid. That feeling is priceless, at the very least well worth the $10 first chapter. There is a decent amount of game play and, if the rest of the chapters can follow suit, this will prove to be a wise investment for adventurers of all ages.\n\n","August 10, 2015","true","12.3"," 34 of 43 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","34","43","6","0"

It is an age of darkness. Point and click adventure games, once a staple of PC gaming, have now been relegated to a niche market only populated by indie developers with small budgets which, while talented, rarely live up to the adventure games of the glory days. Even Telltale, once a proud champion of the genre, has fallen to the appeal of choice-based narrative games, and all hope is lost for a new Sam and Max season. But then, out of the darkness, a newcomer appears - King's Quest, a new installment of the classic adventure series, coming from the freshly revived Sierra by the hands of Activision, taking a break from its busy schedule of gouging CoD players' wallets to deliver the starving point-and-click masses a blessing from above.\n\nKing's Quest essentially feels like what a modern Telltale game would feel like if they were still making puzzle-based games. The writing is well-done and full of puns and witty lines, and it's delivered by a voice cast that seems almost too good to be just for an adventure game including Christopher Lloyd, Josh Keaton, and Tom Kenny. The art style is a great looking cartoonish design that does a great job of emulating the animated feeling of old point-and-clicks in a modern way. The puzzles blend humor and logic in ways that manage to be pretty challenging without feeling obtuse, and some puzzles have multiple solutions that tie into the game's small choice system. King's Quest doesn't seem to be the sort of game where your choices will have a "big impact" like in Telltale's newer games (and the game even jokes about those games a few times), but there are some little choices that you can make throughout the episode that will possibly have an impact on future episodes.\n\nOnly the first of five episodes is currently out, so it's too early to say for sure if it's a truly great game, but I was very impressed with the first episode and will definitely be buying the rest. When I play this game it feels like Telltale never left me.","August 9, 2015","true","16.9"," 33 of 44 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","33","44","4","0"

This game has a long lineage to live up to. And sadly, it falls short. It appears to have the look and charm of the old Kings Quest, but lacks the heart.\n\nThe story is just fine. The artwork is fantastic. But it's been reduced to a simple (and very short) one-click adventure. Gone are the days when you could click on everything and get a humorous response. Gone are the brain baffleing quanderies and mysteries. It's got one cursor that does it all, and quick-time events are the action of the day.\n\nKings Quest was about puzzles. About combining items in creative ways. About turning over every rock, sticking your hand in every hole, picking up everything that wasn't nailed down, and poking every sleeping bear (or dragon). But it was about humor and dialog. Much of which is missing from this game.\n\nIf you're looking for Kings Quest.... this isn't it.

Was it as good as I imagined it could be?\n\nShort Answer: Yes.\nLong Answer: Yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssssssssssssssssss.\n\nThe intro to the game is a loving callback to the original game. I don't quite recall traversing a series of beds to get the Magic Mirror back, but that does help setup the framework of the game, an elderly King Graham sharing stories with his granddaughter (Was she from Alexander or Rosella? I hope that gets answered!), since stories can be embellished.\n\nThe game continues on with the series trademark puns and deaths, but the game is more forgiving than it was back in the 80s-90s. The game automatically saves after certain events. If you die, the game doesn't send you back to the very beginning of that section, but just a moment either just before or just after starting. This is completely beneficial to the series.\n\nThe puzzles do make you think outside of the box sometimes, just like it should be, but the game seems to never cause an unwinnable state that plagued the originals. It also hasn't relied on any "you must be THIS knowledgable about fairy tales and mythology to proceed" either (We ALL remember throwing the bridle at the snake, right? Of course remembered that minor note of mythology!). The only time I ever got really stuck was by my own fault, not realizing there was a screen I hadn't gone to yet.\n\nWhether a long-term fan or a new-comer to the series or even the genre, I would recommend this game highly.\n\nMy only downside is there's a bit of a lack of a tutorial. The game never exactly tells you how to use items on things (though not hard to figure out), but I was taken by surprise when I was thrust into a QTE early on with little time to realize what was going on.","August 1, 2015","true","16.7"," 41 of 61 people (67%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","67","41","61","21","1"

The cell-shading used is just for the characters, not the landscape or scenery - and the overall look of the game was outstandingly gorgeous.\n\nPuzzles: Nothing was overly 'hard' in my opinion, but I've also been playing these types of games for my whole life. They felt like a very great blend of both Sierra and LucasArts puzzles we know and love. As with all these types of games, it's all trial-and-error.\n\nCharacters: There's not many characters that I think will be as memorable or infamous as those in games past - save Gwendolyn, of course (and not counting Graham, obviously). The voice acting was done fantastically by all those involved. (I'm a bit partial to the Guards and Amaya, but I'm a huge fan of both Gideon Emery and Zelda Williams). Even the other Knight hopefuls were good (but still in that not-standout sort of way, y'know what I mean? >.> ) And then there's Manny, voiced by the wondrous Wallace Shawn. There's some cheeky little references (as expected) to Princess Bride thrown in - the whole third-event of the tourney is one. Also - hyper-excited Graham is amusing!\n\nPunnerifcation: Punnery with more puns, iced with punniness. Gwen and Grahams banter was one of the best (try using items where it's not supposed to be used.)\n\nI'm itching to start another playthrough now, fix some things I did wrong by using the wrong action at the wrong time. (Stupid tree, I wanted to use the fruit picker, not shake the tree! Grrr!)\n\nAnd now the anxious wait for "Chapter Two: Eclectic Boogaloo"\n\nADDITION:\n\nIn my original review of this chapter, I think I was a bit hasty in stating that there weren't very many 'memorable' characters in the game. Sure, there's a bunch of characters you get to like, yes, but I thought none of them would hold up (for better or worse) to the likes of Shamir Shamazel or Cedric But upon replaying the game, you get more of an appreciation of the characters. You fall in love with the silence of Achaka. And even the annoying arrogance of Sir Ten (love the pun, he's forever Sir Ten of Himself to me) becomes endearing. But I think the character that takes it all, that wins the best character of the game.. obviously... is Princess Madeline of Avalon.","July 28, 2015","true","20.2"," 38 of 58 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","38","58","2","0"

I liked the open end worlds of the original series. You could make mistakes and get yourself in a corner where you couldn't win. It was a challenge, especially back then because you didn't have the internet to help you cheat through the puzzles. Also in the old games Graham was a bit of a badass. In this one he is a little clumsy dork who has no business being in an adventure game.  The puzzles were too easy and pretty much impossible to screwed up if you click enough buttons. The game play is linear so there are only so many options. It was actually more of a movie than a game. For me this sort of ruined the game and didn't keep true to the orginal series.\n\nIf you were never a fan of the original series, you were part of the entitled generation who feels like they should be a king even though they can barely walk without tripping over their own goofy feet, and you like simple puzzles that you can't fail at then maybe this game is for you.\n\nI am on the fence at how to rate this...

In fact, I'd say it's excellent, as it's a clever mixing of the story and charm of the old games with more modern adventuring (a la Telltale and friends.) Takes a good hour to get to the classic graphical adventure style of puzzles though, and the very first section is very linear with a bit too much "Dragon's Lair" for my taste. But it really opens up after that, with all sorts of inventory, dialogue, and weird puzzles to solve. No shortage of sarcastic narration, puns, and silliness, and the aesthetic is fantastic.\n\nIt may be a good idea to have a gamepad handy even on PC, as mouse+keyboard controls are oddly implemented. Also, some of the puzzles get entirely too repetitive when having to rework them, due to having to watch cutscenes/dialogue repeatedly and you're given no way to skip them. Minor qualms though, and it didn't hamper my enjoyment due to the copious charm and humor.\n\nTook about 6 hours to complete on a completely blind playthrough, which for me felt substantial without overstaying its welcome. Never felt too overwhelmed, but certainly challenged, which is exactly what I look for in games like this!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/auspexao/recommended/345390/","auspexao","AuspexAO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/auspexao/","786 products in account","My introduction to gaming came as early as a few interesting but simple Commodore 64 titles. However, it wasn't until I sat down with my cousin in front of his Apple 2 and played King's Quest that gaming would capture me and continue hold me in its thrall for the rest of my life. I became a devotee of Sierra's adventure games and played every new King's Quest as soon as I could get my hands on them. You need to know this going into this review, as my biases are as deeply rooted as a walnut tree hiding a golden prize.\n\nKing's Quest is a series known for embracing adventure (and the dangers that come with it) and a joyful silliness. The games have genuine moments of heart and emotion, but are not above puns, ridiculous characters, and the odd jab at the player through their narration. This new King's Quest captures this spirit PERFECTLY. It's a game that even a child like my younger self would be happy to play, while still giving a middle-aged man like me a few good laughs at the whimsy of the reimagined Daventry.\n\nThe entire game is told as a frame story (think The Princess Bride) where an old King Graham tells stories to his grandaughter, Gwendolyn. This is hardly the last nod to The Princess Bride you'll see in this game, and if you are as much of a fan of that classic movie as I am, then go ahead and buy the game because you'll love it.\n\nGameplay: What IS this new King's Quest? It's an adventure game. An adventure game not totally in the new Telltale style or the old Sierra style. There are puzzles aplenty, and there are quick-time button pressing events, but there is also plenty of dialogue to experience and choices to be made. I think it's a great hybrid of a more moden "visual novel" style adventure game and an older game in the Lucasarts or Sierra tradition. You can die (what's a Sierra game without death) but there is no actual penalty. If anything the deaths are an often hilarious bonus so you should try to seek them out.  The puzzles, and indeed the story, offer varying solutions and the logic for each solution is for the most part sound. If you find one path too hard to figure out, with any luck another will be more suited to your way of thinking.\n\nArt Style/Graphics: Everything from King Graham's cape to the lush woods looks spectacular. You can tell that the art team really wanted to create something out of a storybook and the look is incredibly well suited to this game.\n\nSound: Ok, I have to say there are a few old King's Quest songs in here and one in particular literally made me choke up with nostalgia (you'll know it when you here it). The voice acting is excellent in places and only ok in others (mostly due to some of the way the lines are read by the young Gwendolyn's voice actor).\n\nOverall: This is most respectful, most immediately endearing relaunch of a franchise I have ever had the joy to play. The pure love the devs had for this franchise really show and I have no doubt that Ken and Roberta Williams really did give their blessing to this team. I can't wait to see more adventures in Daventry (and maybe beyond?). I can honestly say that there may be some jaded people out there that may find this game too silly or whimsical for their liking, but if you are a King's Quest fan then you need to don your adventurer's cap once more for this one.","August 2, 2015","true","5.9"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","17","22","0","2"

While the games had their ups and downs, the most frustrating part of this game is the lack of saves.  Even worse than the bookmarks in King's Quest VII, which at the very least, we had some vestige of control over, this game has four save "slots", leaving one unable to retrace one's steps unless one is willing to delete all the work one has done, replay the entire thing (not being able to skip cutscenes at all in the first chapter, and only some in the second, and later chapters have yet to be released), in order to try a different order of events.

But there are really two issues:\n\n1. You can't skip cut-scenes or dialogues. This means that when you have to replay a part of the game, you have to listen to the same things over and over again. And yes, you often have to replay parts because there are many places where you have to play action-oriented sequences where you can die if you press the wrong button at the wrong time.\n\n2. No free save-system. You can't create and load your progress in the game. This means you cannot easily return to some situations to try out alternative solutions. Also I had the problem, that my computer crashed while playing through the game and afterwards, the single save game that is created automatically without your control, was lost and I would have had to start anew from the beginning of the game.

And for any old school adventure fan you will be throughly disappointed because this game did not live up to the KQ name. Before you write off this review please let me provide some explaination to this without giving away the game. To start I've compiled a list of pros and cons:\n\nPros- The creators tried to capture the magic of the kings quest series by adding elements from the previous games. As one example (spoilers, but its in the trailer), they put the dragon from the first game into the mix as well as some other pretty cool elements. There are also no more issues with dying and having to start over (Forgive my Lucasarts nature on this one please). And the music for the game is quite good. I recognized some old songs with a new twist.\n\nMixed (This category could be good for some and bad for others depending on their style)- The game is basically full of QTE's (Quick time event), action sequences (I call them small little puzzle mini games), and some very limited puzzles that involve picking up items and using them to push the story along (I considered almost every one of these very simple as the game pretty much provides the right direction on what to do).\n\nCons- The art and animation from the game is very inconsistant. The characters look like they were drawn by two different people. Eg. Graham, the Baker, and all the young characters vs the Merchant, the Trolls, and old characters. And then we have the animation. While most of the characters move around fine, the animals of the game have some big issues of remaining frozen as their character is moving about the world. This pulls the viewer out back to reality and game loses some magestic nature. It makes me wonder if they ran out of time (Activision deadline enforced on the Odd Gentleman?) and figured that this could be lived with along with some other bad animation (see the picture below, what Graham says in the game is pretty much how I feel about this game!).\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=588753417\n\nThis story also pretty much cements the fact that their will be no more Kings Quest games or that we are going to have to live with some big changes. They made Graham super old, which means that they will either have to continue using story telling (I believe that this will get old pretty quick), make Gwendolyn take over (Sorry, but not being from the original flagship I'm not super excited about that as I was with Alexander and Rosella), or pass it to old Alexander/Rosella (Probably the best choice, but not great as they will be old as well). I just don't know why they wanted to make the game be what looks to me like 30 years+ into the future, its a game! Time to hang up your cap Graham! (Years based from KQ7, I never played KQ8 all the way through and sorry but that game is not cannon)\n\nThis game reminds me of another I played called the Cave.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/221810/\n\nWith all due respect for that game, I think that there are some people that might like that game. But I just don't. Same reason I don't like first person shooters very much, its not my style. Both of these games are not true point-and-click adventures, but they are similar in nature to the old classics making them easy to group them in the same category. The game did its best to live up to the legacy that is King's Quest, but with such a high standard I believe the game falls short (If you're still wondering all of the things in the mixed category I disliked passionately, QTE's? Seriously?!?) I realize that I am in the minority and this is a different time and some people like this new style. Roberta Williams who always had an ever changing vision (cough...KQ8) is known to have publicly approve the game and the game has recieved praise among some top critics. I was surprised when many people referenced how the game is very Telltale like in nature. I was pretty excited, because I loved Telltale's Monkey Island. But from what I've heard, the game is more like the Walking Dead or Jurassic Park (I have not played these games).\n\nIt is ultmately up to you on whether or not you are into any of these things or not. Myself, I guess I'm ready to bid my old childhood classic adventure game series farewell.\n\n"My first is foremost legally. My second circles outwardly. My third leads all in victory.

I was eager for this title to release, and so far it's been quite a disappointment.\n\nThe game is more of an homage to Kings Quest than an actual Kings Quest game.  The controls are seriously dumbed down.  There is no point and click interface, and most of the "puzzles" so far have been quick-time events.  You can't look at the scenery for atmosphere, unless the game wants you to look at something.  It is inexcusable for an adventure game to be so stuck on rails like this.  The voice acting is great, but doesn't fit playing Grahm in first person hearing an old man narrate his actions.  This may change later in the game.\n\nThe environments are extremely bland, generic, and reuse art assets.  However it's all done very well so that you won't notice unless you're looking for it.\n\nThe episodic style release is also, frankly, an insult to the series.  I would imagine it's only purpose was to disguise an early release and give the team more time to work on later episodes.\n\nThe art, dialogue and music just drop the ball blatantly.  The puzzles are shallow.  This is a Kings Quest game by name only.\n\nEverything was built to the "Odd Gentlemen" theme ( steampunk-esque I guess ) instead of being built to Kings Quest.  There is a distinct lack of color and vibrancy as were in the KQ games.\n\nIt's a good game mind you.  But if you're looking for Kings Quest; Just play Kings Quest.  I recommended against if you're a fan of the series.  If you're looking for a generic adventure game, you'll enjoy yourself.  However I would wait for a sale after all episodes are released.\n\nBook of Unwritten Tales is a far superior adventure game, in every single way imaginable.\n\nTo the developers; Not everything needs to be dumbed down.  Not everything must be spoon fed.  Not everything needs quick-time events.","July 28, 2015","false","6.3"," 232 of 434 people (53%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","53","232","434","17","10"

The new King's Quest manages to capture the wonder and amazement of its predecessors and successfully brings the franchise into the 21st century. While playing it made me feel like a kid again playing the first one back in the late '80s. Which I'll be honest. It's kinda hard to outdo the classics in my opinion.\n\nKing's Quest doesn't outshine the games that came before but it certainly comes close and will most certainly become a classic in its own right. The characters are quite memorable and several funny moments had me in stitches. Even the horrible puns grew on me. Being able to choose how Graham takes on the myriad challenges affects how his granddaughter reacts to events in the present.\n\nIf there's one problem that I had with the first chapter is that I wanted it to keep going. It'll be hard to wait between episodes as I want more great stories in the land of Daventry. If the rest of the series is as good as the first one then all of my original misgivings about The Odd Gentlemen's entry in the mythology would be totally quashed.","August 19, 2015","true","24.5"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","13","20","0","0"

The game is atmospheric for sure, but it just feels totally "on rails", the QTE interactions are so minimal in parts that it might as well have been done with full motion video. It is annoying that you can't skip the cut-scenes and have to watch them over and over. Once you get into the first "quest", the flow is still very linear, there are only ever one or two things to look at or use in each screen and the puzzles are much more simplistic than the Sierra of old. This game doesn't really seem sure what it wants to be, flicking between QTE, shooting action, dialog trees and semi-interactive cut-scenes, and classic style puzzles, leaving an overall flat impression because it doesn't do any of them particularly well.\n\nOne of the great things about the old KQ titles was the openness of the worlds and the lack of sequence in which you had to do the sub-quests, and not every useful object was blindingly obvious. Its a shame that there is not more depth because the graphics are beautifully detailed. I'm trying to like this game, but it just seems very dull and leaves me yearning to play, not the classic point and clicks or text adventures, but a good adventure like Zelda Ocarina of Time where there is an actual world full of things to do and explore.\n\nI'm sure I'd have to get deeper into this game to fully appreciate it, but at the moment, its just not giving enough to keep going and seems too tedious to play.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Roflhazard/recommended/345390/","Roflhazard","[HL] Captain Christ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Roflhazard/","271 products in account","King's Quest is an adventure game developed by a small indie studio named "The Odd Gentlemen" released in summer of 2015. As of writing this review, currently I have only played the first episode as it is the only one released and available. However, I believe that this will give us a good idea of what is to come.\n\nAt first I did not think much of this game, but as I had just gotten into adventure games about a month prior and had consumed all the major ones available, I decided I would give it a try. So, using my newly refunded money from another 10 dollar game I was not satisfied with, I purchased it and decided to give it a go. As it turned out, I was very pleasantly surprised.\n\nI will admit that at first I was not too impressed. The graphical style was very similar to that of a Telltale game (Not that I dislike Telltale's style, but I was hoping for something slightly different) and there was a lack of pretty much any anti-aliasing options. On top of that, I found myself thrown into the game with no introduction of what was going on. However, while the first couple minutes were a bit difficult to adjust into, I found that the game quickly picked up.\n\nThe game has a relatively light-hearted feel to it, and I found myself laughing along to a lot of the cheap puns and quirky jokes thrown into the mix. The characters were fairly memorable too, and I enjoyed pretty much everyone I came across. A particular favorite of mine was Whisper, a very pompous knight who is infatuated with none other than himself. The game gives you a lot of room to roam around, similar to the style of many old adventure games and RPGs. As this is only the first episode, I do not know how much the decisions you make actually matter, but I found myself entertained regardless with virtually every aspect of gameplay.\n\nThe setting of the game was enchanting as well. Set in a fantasy environment, you will encounter many creatures such as dragons, bridge trolls, and even intelligent squirrels. As the game allows you to roam freely while you solve various puzzles, you will typically find yourself roaming through dark caves, villages, and ominous forests. The music pairs up with this very well, and really immerses you into the game world. Honestly, the only complaint I can think of with this game is that you are not able to skip cutscenes should you fail some events, however I am sure they plan on doing something about this in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, I came into King's Quest not expecting much more than some mediocre adventure game to occupy a couple hours of my time. However after playing for a total of 7 hours on merely one chapter, and enjoying nearly every minute of it, I exited finding myself very pleasantly surprised, and eagerly awaiting the next episode. I implore anyone who has not played this yet to give it a go, I sincerely doubt you will be disapointed. My final score for King's Quest is a 97/100, a must buy for any adventure game lover, and I look forward to playing any future installments.","August 11, 2015","true","14.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","2"

In my opinion this is not deserving of the King's Quest title (big shoes to fill). This game plays like it's made for a 12 year old for the majority of the game (first chapter). That's not a bad thing but King's Quest was often times dark and sinister and the world brought that across quite well. This game not so much although the voice acting has moments of brilliance it just feels too PG13.\n\nThe quick time events don't take away from the game but they don't add much either. One of the biggest dissapointments is no point and click interface. The puzzles are far too simple with only 1 or 2 that were interesting and thought provoking. King's Quest was always about engaging puzzles and this game lacks those right from the start.\n\nI don't want to rag on this game too much. It's great in its own right with a fantastic art style and great voice acting. If you're a hardcore fan of the old series then this will do little to bring back that nostalgic feel of those games, however, if you're new to the series this is likely going to be an enjoyable playthrough.","August 2, 2015","false","8.8"," 29 of 52 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","29","52","0","0"

I'm sick of how many games have gone to an episodic format but I'm much less turned off when I can try the game first, even if I'm fairly sure I'm going to like the game.\n\nAnd I'm old. I played all the original Sierra game many years ago. I don't remember much of anything about it but I'm sentimental about the series regardless.\n\nAnd with even more of that crap out of the way let me get to reviewing what I've played so far...\n\nIt's great. It's fun. And I've enjoyed the hell out of playing most of the first chapter. I think a standout so far is the voice acting and actors. So many adventure games have horrible dialog and actors and happily this one doesn't kill my soul with banality or downright lack of talent. The voice cast here fits well and for the most part kicks butt. Not to mention the  total fan-service with little hidden gems- (and here I'll take a little parenthetical diversion- Little touches like Christopher Lloyd giving us a tiny dialog easter egg after the Battle of Wits. Or freaking Wallace "Vizzini" Shawn from Princess Bride doing an openly and awesomly great homage to the aforementioned movie.)\n\nThere are puns. And those of us who happen to love fantasy writers like Piers Anthony are fine with that. More than fine with actually. And we groan lovingly at them. As we should.\n\nThe controls can be wonky at times but are serviceable enough. The quicktime events are only slightly annoying (until right after the battle of wits) unlike most games that rely on them to create a complete teeth gnashingly pointless challenge that makes you want to smash every keyboard in your house.\n\nThe game looks good. It's very "Telltale" in its execution but I'm fine with that. It works and it works well.\n\nOverall I was likely to buy the game regardless of whether they made the first chapter free- I would have just waited for a sale after the whole series was released. And I may wait until it comes down in price just a little bit. But I'm buying the whole game as soon as I can't stand waiting anymore.\n\nSo for once the episodic model has worked (and a note to future game developers STOP MAKING EPISODIC GAMES. IT'S A STUPID RELEASE FORMAT AND MAKES US HATE YOU TO YOUR VERY CORE- just give us the beginning of the game as a demo and we'll follow like lemmings).\n\nAnd a side note to the jerks who complain about a game being too easy. Screw you. Stop insisting that every game punishes you. Did your mother not give you enough hugs and make you perform impossible tasks in order to get attention? Some of us like to play games for pure entertainment value. And this one does this impossibly well.\n\nI hope Sierra tries to relive some more of the old magic they used to give us all those years ago.","May 22","true","7.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It took me about six hours to complete the story and then another two hours to come back in and get all the achievements that I missed.\n\nThis game is a big nostalgia trip for a lot of people, but I've got no previous experience with the series and only middling experience with adventure games in general. However, I thoroughly enjoyed this game.\n\nIt is an absolutely stunningly gorgeous game. I heard on Game Grumps that apparently a lot of the scenery was handpainted for the game? If so that's incredible.\n\nThe voice acting is much better than what I expected. Including some more well known actors like Christopher Lloyd and Wallace Shawn.\n\nOverall though, the game is very simple. There were only two parts of the whole thing where I felt challenged, and they were both "boss fights" and neither one was particularly difficult in itself, just hard for me to understand what I was supposed to be doing.\n\nIt's been said before, but this a game that grows on you. At first you might be put off by some of the cutesy nature of things, or the rather simple plot, but it's definitely a game that appreciates subtlety and details like *SPOILER*when in the prologue you complete puzzles with a bow left by a dead adventurer and then later you travel through the cave with that very adventurer, giving more meaning and weight to a part of the game that you've already completed. *END SPOILER* The simple writing and use of puns and wordplay as jokes grew on me over the course of it, and I left feeling fairly satisfied at the end of the Chapter. On that note, because this is an episodic game, I'll likely try to write more of this review for each chapter.\n\nThis is also notable for being one of the few adventure games I've seen which has multiple solutions to puzzles available, so if you prefer more off-the-wall adventure game mechanics, there's likely a solution like that, and if you think in more of a straightforward fashion, there's that as well.","August 30, 2015","true","11.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wraithward/recommended/345390/","Wraithward","Wraithward","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wraithward/","103 products in account",">As of finishing Ch. 1 on 7-30-15\n>Overall Score: 7/10; Fairly Enjoyable\n\nLike many 90's kids whom had the privilege of knowing Sierra Entertainment, I've played my fair share of King's Quest. I would go so far as to say that the franchise influenced who I am; as the games taught me the concepts of critical thinking, perspective, and attention to detail in ways nothing else could've hoped to inspire. However, I also understand that the original game design Old Sierra had could never pass to audiences in modern times, and am attempting to remove nostalgia from my opinions.\n\nI had no idea what to expect out of the new title. I just hoped that they didn't completely screw it up. While I won't say that New Sierra and The Odd Gentlemen nailed the KQ formula, they've offered a fun and whimsical look at what was through a fresher scope. The plot is a rather vanilla, but works well for introductions. The voice acting is enjoyable to listen to and characters are written well, if not a little simply. Preview videos and interviews for this title had the devs. and voice actors putting more stock into how important the characters are than they really are, but KQ has always been a franchise where fleeting acquaintanceship with otherwise charming individuals has been par for the course.\n\nThe game sounds nice. The music works well, matching scenes with perfect flow. No sound effect feels terribly out-of-place. I did have one audio glitch where an ongoing background conversation managed to get itself stuck in two different dialogue loops simultaneously. Simply leaving the screen and returning fixed the issue.\n\nA lot of reviewers will compare the structure of the story to The Princess Bride, and it certainly follows that template, but not in a way I find insulting. The lack of an opening is a little disorienting, but it is something easily gotten over and actually works well to the game's point of dropping in mid-story. The narration isn't often so pervasive that it feels like listening more than playing. However, I did find it offers reminders or not-so-subtly points the player in the right direction more often than an exploratory game should. If you're expecting a lot of curveballs in your item collecting - likened to the times of yore - don't, you won't really be getting them. Also, in the puzzles, failure is an option, but it's also a negligible option. Between the game's auto-saves and the game being too willing to give you a second chance, there is no penalty for failure. The game seems afraid to punish you, which I find disappointing, but not unexpected as this trend in video games has been growing for years now.\n\nI stand among the crowd who find the use of QuickTime Events annoying. They aren't so abrupt as to be jarring and they do fit the action detailed in the scenes, but I had just hoped for a more elegant solution for my favorite adventure franchise. To their credit, though, a few of the QTEs give ample time to admire how fantastic some of the animations are. The more fluid effects, like fire and water, are so visually pleasing that I would not mind the excuse to use more of the same.\n\nThe game is very pretty. The art style very much suits the title. It is everything you'd expect out of a visual storybook. I did find some transition animations a little jarring and some of the foreground objects surprisingly low-res for a game that's been in development for this long, but neither really effect my appreciation of the scenery as a colorful whole.\n\nThere are some people who will complain about rehashed resources in the landscape, but  Ch. 1's overall plot of land is fairly small. There's still a lot to see in upcoming chapters, and I don't think the game should be judged for it's re-use in assets on as harshly as if it were a full game. Many of the KQ's have historically bound you to a small plot of land until such-and-such event or object has been obtained. KQ 2015 has not gotten to the point of releasing us from that small proverbial pen yet. The game mostly takes place in a patch of woodlands; so, I find it acceptable for the majority of the scenery to look similar. I also feel like there is enough definition in the landscape to look natural, yet keep the imagination from getting bored or lost in "more of the same."\n\nIn the end, I like the game. It's not everything I had hoped for, but it isn't a terrible attempt either. It's worth a pick-up for an afternoon of wandering through quiet scenery and mild puzzle-solving. It's a quaint title with a lot to live up to; very much like it's protagonist. Hopefully, in Graham's transition from Knight-hopeful to King and beyond, the game is given the last bit of polish it needs to be the outstanding title it very nearly is.","August 2, 2015","true","11.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Daventry is lovingly crafted in this reimagining, fans of the series will enjoy references to past entries and newcomers will enjoy that the puzzles actually make sense this time. Using a mysterious skill called 'logic,' players don't go around using everying on everything else in hopes of progressing but instead use items is ways that make a lot more sense.  There are multiple ways to solve each puzzle too, which gives the game great replayability. The only slightly dissapointing part of the game are the quick time events (of which there are only two, at the begining and end) and the inability to skip dialoge. The qtes, while still enjoyable, feel disconnected from the rest of the experience and didn't give the player enough time to react, thanks to numerous, forgiving checkpoints King Grahms hillarious, plentiful puns however death was made enjoyable.  This could be one of the best games to come out this year, and as of writing this, only chaper one of five (and an epiloge if you buy the whole game at once) is out.\n\nAs a side note, I think Life Is Strange by Dontnod is a great companion to this game, both feature astounding amounts of choice in varying importance and with LIS's more serious nature complements King's Quest's sillyness very well.\n\nTLDR\nGo buy it now.

But this time we relive the memories of King Graham as he tells about his epic adventures to his young granddaughter Gwendalyn. And with that said let's begin the review.\n\n[The Story]\n\nKing Graham is becoming very old, but the tales are a long way from over. Graham is now on his older day, telling the stories of how he came to be where is now this very day, to his granddaugther Gwendalyn (Which is the daugther of Prince Alexander and Cassima from the prequal “Heir today, Gone tomorrow”). The stories goes gradually in chapters from how Graham became a knight, how he later on became king and afterwards what happened on his travels when he had become the ruler of Daventry.\n\nAlready in the 1. Chapter there has been fantastical creatures, colorful NPCs, epic enviroments, wonderful humor, and a delectable variety of puns, as we all that has played the prequals came to love the series for.\n\n[Gameplay]\n\nThe gameplay of this game is very traditional for almost any point and click games out there. But this time the developers thought of the players which prefer to play with a controller and made the game so a controller port was the most natural in the world.\n\nBut as said before it is very traditional to the Point and Click genre and there are items to be picked up and puzzles to be solved all over the place. The puzzles are very clever and sometimes one needs to sit for a minute and think about what on earth could be the solution.\n\nAs it has become very popular to implement a multiple-choice mechanic into games as of late, to create some variation to the gameplay and test the players, so of course did the developers “The Odd Gentlemen” the same thing with this game. Not so much that it alters/changes the main story too much, but enough to create some originality to the individual players game and produce a sense of choice.\n\nThe deaths are as goofy as they were in the prequals, and to keep the tradition there will be sass after death happen. The only difference this time, is that it is Grahams granddaughter Gwendalyn that calls you out for being silly dying that way.\n\n[Graphics]\n\nThe graphics are very pretty and special because the textures of everything in the game was handdrawn. It gives the game an epic and beautiful feeling while venturing forth in this fantastical world.\n\nIt's a 3d game but the handdrawn textures makes it look like something straight out of a storybook. Colorful and Beautiful.\n\n[Sounds/Music]\n\nThe sounds in this game are very good and realistic to the real thing. Birds, wolves and even wind sounds like the real deal and with the graphics, creates a good enviroment for the players to immerge themselves in.\n\n\nThe music is mostly orcestral and has a nice epic feeling to it while you walk around in the enviroment.\n\nThe voiceacting are also very good and contains voiceactors that has a very successful career.\n\nVoiceactor cast:\n\nChistopher Lloyd (The voiceactor of Emmett “Doc” Brown from Back to the Future, Uncle Fester from The Addams Family and Judge Doom from Who Framed Roger Rabbit)\nTom Kenny (The voiceactor of Spongebob SquarePants, Ice King from Adventure Time, Heffer Wolfe from Rocko's Modern Life, The Mayor and Narrator from The Powerpuff Girls, Carl from Johnny Bravo, Dog from CatDog, Eduardo from Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, Rabbit from Winnie the Pooh and Spyro from the Spyro the Dragon franchise.)\nMicheal Benyaer (That was a voiceactor in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen)\nLoretta Devine (That was a voiceactor in Crash)\nGideon Emery (Voiceactor from Teen Wolf)\nJean Gilpin (Voiceactor from Frozen)\nMichael Gough (Voiceactor from Batman: Arkham Origins)\nAndy Pessoa (Voiceactor from Transformers: Prime)\nKevin Michael Richardson (Voiceactor from The Cleveland Show)\nKath Soucie (Voiceactor from Rugrats)\nFred Tatasciore (Voiceactor from Marvel's Avengers Assemble)\nRichard White (The voice of Gaston from Disney's Beauty and the Beast)\nMicheal-Leon Wooley (Voice of Louis the Alligator from Disney's The Princess and the Frog)\n\n[The Conclusion]\n\nAll in all I am fully in love with this game, and think of it as a great comeback to the series after 17 years since the last release. I find the world beautiful and interresting, the NPCs funny and well written, the story epic and worth immerging into and the Puzzles clever and challenging. I would fully recommend this game to anyone that like the Point and Click genre, or just likes to have a nice adventure infront of the screen.

I will update if my opinion changes over time with more episodes.\n---\n\nThe latest installment in Sierra's historic line of point-and-click adventures is an absolute joy to play. They managed to do everything right, and seem to have cut out many less desirable aspects of the King's Quest series.\n\nI actually find it hard to fault this title for doing much wrong. This time around you actually get to control your character directly (controller support is great - Steam controller too). They added in some really awesome action sequences in between the classic point-and-click puzzle solving. Its all very interactive. The artwork and graphics are superb. The voice acting is some of the best I have seen (they even have some A-list actors). The narration reminds me mildly of Bastion in the sense that you are actively living a story/fairy tale. Its all very well done.\n\nPros:\n+They manage to keep the same feel as the classics; details such as a nonlinear fairy-tale world and creative solutions to puzzles.\n+Graphics are beautiful. Very much attention to detail (ie. the lighting and the cape, the forests feel alive)\n+Cinematography is top-notch. It feels like you are playing a Disney or Pixar movie. The characters are well developed.\n+The story telling is really fun, and sucks you in. My wife and I couldn't stop playing. It is a joy.\n+Controller support is smooth.\n+Voice acting is absolutely great (and I will also mention the volume mixing levels are perfect - they focus on hearing the voice front-and-foremost, which for some reason tends to be problematic in these types of games).\n+There certainly seems to be several paths one can take - hinting at tons of replayability.\n+One major welcome difference from some of the old titles is that the puzzle solving is not as random or silly. Things tend to be fairly logical (or as logical as they can be in a fairy tale world).\n\nCons:\n-Very minor, but it would be nice to have a button or a way to skip certain animations while puzzle solving. Some can get redundant, but it is minor because of how short the animations/sequences tend to be.\n\nThis title is just really well done - a very welcome surprise for those that loved the King's Quest games of yesteryear. Totally worth full price, IMO.","November 29, 2015","true","9.1"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

Gameplay wise it's like a combination of the previous-and-click King's Quest games, and decision making games like "The Walking Dead" by Telltale and "Life is Strange" (but lighter and less dramatic which is a nice change).

Why the vast price difference? To me it's simple. I played and beat the telltale game The walking dead season 2 in 8 hours. I beat the first kings quest episode in 6 hours. So it actually seems like there is at least double the game there. Additionally the telltale series is a very different type of adventure game. Based on reaction timing to parse text and respond. In this game you can take all the time in the world and not have to worry about any split second text parsing to answer something quickly. A greater system in my opinion. It also seems like the choices made here are greater than telltale's. The effected sorty archs remain split for much longer than telltale games it seems.

I liked the grandpa voice telling his tale to his granddaughter.\nFun characters\nSome humor\nStorytelling elements\n\nthe cons:\nDying is a real pain, you have to go back and start over and over, for some reason my buttons on my laptop didn't work well with this game. It is torturous to repeat the same scenes over and over again without the option to skip. Heck, I played Long live the queen and died way more, but at least, it was fun, lol.\nWalking back and forth to do tasks can be very long and tedious at times.\n\nI'm patient, so if you are not a patient player this game is certainly not for you. I was planning on finishing and completing this game to the end because I do enjoy it. But then I found out I cannot.\nBecause I only paid for 2 episodes. What in the world? I'm glad I didn't play full price for two episodes and find that out or else I would be furious. I am only disappointed. I feel like it's a bit misleading. So if you want to play the full game, you need the full season pass for 30 bucks.\n\nI'm sorry Sierra, but that's a definite no from me if I ever had the choice to purchase the game again. I wish it weren't so, as I enjoy the graphics, characters and gameplay.

There doesn't seem to be near as much clicking on everything as one would expect. You mosey about until you see a big clear prompt near what you're standing at.

I would compare it to Brothers: A Tale of Two sons. There is a strong focus on the story and the presentation and the gameplay elements are a bit lighter, easier compared to other games.\n\nIf I'd compare it to Telltale games (like The Walking Dead), I'd say that Telltale games have a strong focus on dialogue while this game provides a healthy mix of QTEs, action sequences, puzzle solving and dialogue.\n\nThe way everything is presented makes it feel very cinematic. The start of the game is quite linear but the main meat of the first episode is a very big area where you need to go to a lot of different zones to solve the different puzzles.\n\nHumor is a personal preference but I really liked it in this game. It's very punny and they are very self aware of how groanworthy puns can be.\n\nThe game itself looks great. I think one thing that stook out like a sore thumb was clipping issues while characters where animating during cutscenes. E.g. If a character would scratch his nose, his finger would partially disappear into his face.\n\nAnother thing I was less a fan off where unskippable cutscenes.

Getting King's quest: Chapter 1 was a nostalgia buy after playing KQ7 and having fond memories of it.\n\nTo be honest, it is a buy I now regret, the game is completely linear and the ''options'' it gives you are completely obvious and basically impossible to miss, the game is not in the least bit challenging the humor that i loved in previous sierra games has changed into one stretched out joke about puns. Terrible.\n\nTo be honest, if it wasn't for the unskippable dialogue scenes that you get to watch over and over again if you fail something or accidentaly click space when it ends, I doubt it would even take me more than 2 hours to finish this game and I would promptly ask for a refund.\n\n4.7 hours is how much time i spent playing this game waiting to get to the fun part, never got to it.

But the game is very fun and enjoyable. Puzzles follow on each other in a very good manner, I only found one of them to be a chore where you have to fit every item to every other interactable world object. Also the coins thing was odd, and I was always worried about running out of coins. The last annoying thing is that if you miss an achievement you have to replay the game to get the achievement :( This is annoying for a completionist.

It is very much like watching a Disney movie. The characters are very well written, humorous and memorable. I found myself tearing up part way through (but won't post any spoilers). Even the music (which is beautiful) had some hints of the old music from the series in it.\n\nTrue to the old King's Quest it is easy to die in this game, however you do not have to worry about saving. It will automatically start you off from where you left off, and there are no dead ends.\n\nThe adventure game puzzles are not incredibly difficult like the old games, but they are still enjoyable.\nApparently the last puzzle of the game was noted to be difficult, but we got it on our first try. I suppose we got lucky.\nThere are different ways to complete the puzzles which I found interesting, and they affect the future slightly.\n\nNow the only drawbacks I found to this game were the inability to skip cutscenes (which can get annoying if you die several times in a row) or inability to have multiple save files to see how your choices change things.\n\nI loved this game and can't wait for the next installment.","August 7, 2015","true","18.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'll try and edit in reviews for subsequent chapters.\n\nFull disclosure: Age 27. Grew up playing largely PC games as opposed to console. King's Quest 6 and 7 were two of the most influential games of my childhood and were extremely, extremely formative for me. Not just in my taste in games, but in my taste in fantasy over all. I can't fairly say how much of this review is truely blind nostalgia, and how much is influenced just by me liking this style of game due to being exposed to them early on and loving them.\n\nActual review: I loved this. I thought it was a good outing in the KQ style that kept crucial aspects of the series while updating some basic mechanics (using WASD to move as opposed to pure point+click). When compared to the entirity of prior KQ games I've played this did have a touch more light whimsical moments and the puzzles were a touch simpler. That said, this is only the first 20% of the game, and when comparing it to the first 20% of other KQ games I've played it seems par for the course.\n\nVoice acting was top notch. Hit at least one stumper puzzle that required Beloved Adventure Game Logic to complete (I had to get a hint. It was a pretty quirky solution). Backrounds were rich and painterly. Game was colorful, and aesthetically pleasing. The puns were as well... "quality" as you can get with puns. And yes - there's snarky call-outs when you die.\n\nI look forward to the rest of the episodes!\n\n","August 1, 2015","true","15.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Can't wait for chapter 2!  For people that reviewd it negatively, make sure you play past the intro...  The intro is a click story, similar to Dragon's Lair even.  However, past that, it is a true King's Quest game.  The worlds opens up, good but not too tough puzzles, lots of puns, and lots of fun.  They did an amazing job holding to the draw of the originals, and making it much more modern.  It took around 6 hours or so for chapter 1, and now waiting for chapter 2 with several unused items still in inventory.  Now, to use a different save slot and try again with some different decisions.  Seems decisions you make wil have some effect in later chapters.\n\nIf you played original King's Quest games, you will LOVE this one.  $10 for chapter 1 is a steal.  GET IT!

For the first time I can remember, there's a reason to go back and play the same chapter over and over again.  Even if you think you messed up, you haven't.

I love interacting with things multiple times to hear the different funny narration you get.\n\nThere's lots of replayability with the different choices and puzzle solutions and I wonder how much will carry over to future episodes.\n\nThe first couple hours were very linear, so I was pleasantly surprised when the game opened up for a ton of exploration.  In that sense,  the game felt like a very old "open world" adventure game like one of the old King's Quest or Monkey Island games.\n\nThe characters and story are very charming and feel very "King's Quest" to me.  There's a ton of references that only people who played the old games will catch, but they shouldn't detract for a first time player.\n\nThere's much much more exploration and gameplay than a Telltale game, but anyone looking for an unforgiving old school Sierra game will be disappointed.  The puzzles are much more logical, straightforward, and simple, relying on exploration more than sideways leaps of logic like some of the more infamous moments of the old games. (Eg, starting a machine with a piece of cheese).  There was only one time I got stuck where I couldn't figure out what to do just by exploring more or taking a moment to think about my inventory or things I hadn't accomplished yet, and that was entirely down to missing an interactive hotspot.\n\nIn addition to exploring for items, puzzle sequences, and dialog trees, there are some first person bow shooting sequences and QTEs but for the most part I thought they weren't too difficult and fit in the game perfectly fine.  There was one sequence where you shoot a bunch of monsters to save one of the NPCs.  It wasn't graphic or anything, but I felt this was out of place in the series because while there were violent options in the earlier games, there was always a nonviolent alternative available.  Maybe I missed it?\n\nThe game could also use a run button, the ability to skip dialogs / cutscenes, and some other bits of polish.\n\nI'm still partial to the darker, Arabian Nights tone KQ6 had, and I'm also very partial to the KQ2 ADG remake.  However, I feel like this is a great continuation of the series.  The more forgiving gameplay and family friendly, modern CG animated feature feel of the game is much more reminiscent of the direction KQ7 wanted to take the series, except in my opinion executed much much better here.\n","August 1, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Favorites were KQ3 and KQ6. I was really looking forward to this game.  However, there were many things that gave me pause when I saw the previews.  What little animations I saw reminded me more of KQ7(which I did not enjoy). The premise of this all being some story Graham is telling Gwendolyn initially sucked the mystery out of where they might take this story.\n\nThat being said....\n\nI just finished it and found it to be a really solid first chapter.  Not perfect, but solid.\n\nThe Good Stuff:\n-The scenery is georgeous\n-The voice acting is great\n-There were just enough nostalgic winks to be appropriate without that being the entire game\n-Some of the puzzles were quite interesting\n-The humor is good\n-The music is good\n-The entire chapter was just very warm and charming.  I had a smile on my face while I was playing it for the most part.\n-I'm looking forward to the next chapter and what they will do next.\n\nThe Not So Good Stuff:\n-No way of skipping cutscenes that you have seen before\n-The controls were a little clunky at times\n-This did seem a little too goofy and kiddie at times.  I wish it had more of a gritty and darker element to it.\n-I wish the puzzles were a bit more challenging and there was less hand-holding.  I want to feel like I really figured something out and really worked for it when I solve some puzzles(especially the big ones).  That feeling is incredible and was somewhat lacking in this first chapter.\n\nTo be honest, I'm just glad the game wasn't a disaster.  So many reboots and remakes come out and genuinely anger fans of the original.  This wasn't one of them for me.  Solid job so far.  I do hope it gets better and I'm looking forward to what the next chapter brings.\n\n8/10","August 3, 2015","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It keeps the nostalgic value while implementing the new also. It is an easy game imo, so if you are looking for a challenge, this has some but not much for those looking for tough puzzles(but interesting). I'd guess you would say it is very forgiving. It was still very fun to play(definitely keeps you interested).\n\nIt has been a long time since I've played any of the quest series but I thought they used to have a scoring system for the items found and/or the progress made but this does not(unless I missed somehow?). It does have some fun achievements though.\n\nI started a replay which seemed like it was going to let me take different paths but they end up leading to the same outcome basically. There are some different dialogues which is kinda cool.\n\nI didn't run into many bugs, just a couple of the cut scenes seem to be choppy but very little. The game runs very smooth but I do have a gaming pc. The controls are fairly smooth for the actions needed in game so no complaints there.\n\nAll in all, if I had to buy again for $9.99 I would.","August 5, 2015","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The first episode lasted a long time - longer than I have come to expect from games with episodic releases.  The graphics were beautiful!  It was fun and funny.  I also thought the interactions between King Graham and his granddaughter Gwendolyn were heartwarming.  There are different ways to solve each of the puzzles: being kind, being tricky and smart, or being strong (possibly violent).  My first time through I went with the kindness route.\nIf you are a casual gamer or loved the first King's Quest games, you will love this game!  I've noticed that most of the negative reviews seem to come from hard-core gamers that compare the game to first-person shooters or other games like that.  This game is not meant to be that.  It's fun and I think it is a great introduction to casual adventure gaming.  Also, totally family friendly so your (older) kids should be able to play it as well.  There are a couple parts that require a little coordination that I had to try a couple of times, like shooting the arrows at the ropes while floating down the river.  But it wasn't too hard that it took more than a few tries.\nRecommendations for the developers: make it possible to skip the cutscenes or the commentary, at least after the first time.  I also thought that he did walk around decently fast the first time, but having two speeds to his walking (or having walking and running) could be nice.\nSome other reviews mentioned that you have to steal a "wheel" from one of the stores.  Actually, you can pay for it.  Even though all the shopkeepers are gone, there is a tin available in each of the shops where you can put your money.  Don't worry, you still have enough money left to finish the game.","August 21, 2015","true","44.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was blown away by the quality production of that game and haven't played a single adventure game to this day that surpasses it. KQ6 is without a doubt the best in the series. Even if the graphics are outdated, it still holds on its own today. When I heard a new King's Quest series was going to be released I got a bit nervous as I was afraid it wouldn't live up to the quality of KQ6, but was hopeful when I heard that Jane Jensen was getting involved. After playing the first chapter of this new series, the following are my opinions of the game, how it compares to my favorite adventure game KQ6, and whether you should buy it or not. I will be updating this review as I play each chapter.\n\nGraphics/Art Direction - The artwork in this game is AMAZING and I would say it's the best aspect of this game. More specifically the color palette is so vivid and really provides a great fantasy storybook look and feel. I was NOT disappointed with the art direction. This is a VERY beautiful game. Props to The Odd Gentlemen on this.\n\nMusic/Voice Acting - The music is light and witty and full of emotion. The soundtrack constantly changes as you move from area to area and sometimes you can hear familiar melodies from past KQ games. The voice acting is great from some very popular actors.\n\nGameplay Mechanics/Controls - I've played 3D adventure point-and-click adventure games and they do work if you execute it properly. I was disappointed when I found out this was not a point-and-click adventure game. In fact, it plays better with a controller. They are targeting the Xbox and PS4 platforms, so I understand why they decided to go this route. It just felt like there was less potential for exploration because discovering items is limited to the position of the character's model and not a precise cursor. Also, there were a lot less description actions in this game compared to the previous games. You could apply the Eye action on anything in the scene and it would read out a description. Here it's limited to a few spots in a scene. While I'm not a big fan of Quick Time Events being in a KQ game, it really wasn't a big deal here. I would highly recommend playing this game with a controller instead of keyboad/mouse.\n\nStory/Tone - While only the first chapter is released, I hope they don't continue the same tone of this chapter. One of my favorite aspects I loved about KQ6 was it had a perfect mix of tone. It had moments of humor, drama, romance, action, and dark tone. The writers weren't afraid of incorporating dark story elements in a kids adventure game. I mean, the main character of KQ6 travels to the realm of the dead to challenge the Lord of the Dead to resurrect some characters. Also, there are many times in KQ6 where characters try to KILL the main character. In KQ6 the death sequences were not presented in a humorous way like this game. They were tragic and sometimes horrific (they try to lighten the mood by throwing in a pun after every death). You don't get those dark moments in this game. No other character in the first chapter of this game aside from a cute dragon and wolves tries to threaten the life of Graham. Because of this you don't feel as attached to the character and you don't feel like you'll lose something if you make the wrong choice. Also, the ending of the first chapter is quite abrupt and jarring. I definitely hope they turn up the notch of dark elements in future chapters otherwise, this is just going to turn into a happy children's book. The story is great for kids though.\nTL;DR: This game is a solid adventure game full of passion and high energy, but compared to the past KQ games is a bit watered/dumbed down in maturity and depth. I highly recommend newcomers to the KQ franchise to play this new series. I also recommend this for players who have played the previous KQ games, but for the better experience you'll have to let go of some of your favorite aspects of the previous KQ games.","August 5, 2015","true","14.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Seems like they could have easily exchanged Graham for Guybrush Threepwood and it would have worked just as well.\n\nChapter two is out now, and it has definitely filled in on the fairy tale aspect.  But it is considerably shorter than the first chapter.  I also dislike that they force you to replay the chapter if you want to get all of the achievements.  I appreciated that in the first chapter it was a possibility, if you were thorough.  Still an enjoyable game but I am concerned as to where it will go from here.

Unlike other franchises who bring in top names only to deliver sub-par performances (I'm looking at you Peter Dinklage), you can tell that the talent involved in this game really got sucked in and became the parts they played.

To it's credit, in a category of gaming that went up it's own backside with trying to out surreal it's competition when it ran out of unique story settings, it knows what it's going for.\n\nKing's Quest is (and has always been) very twee & full of non offensive attempts at humour, especially puns. More then often this comedy misses more than it hits and ends up coming across like a low-budget, imitiation, straight to broadcast Disney cartoon. 30 years ago, this was passable in a video-game where intelligent script writing wasn't something expected out of a bedroom sized husband and wife programming team. Nowadays however, especially with three decades of bonafide classics that have come since, the bar is astronomically high to aim to try and create a 'funny' game.\n\nAttached to a somewhat shakey story premise which borrows perhaps a little too heavily from the film 'The Princess Bride', both the art direction and voice acting are really rather good with plenty of recognisable talent taking on character roles. The background art in particular is stunning & while perhaps small in scope being released as an episodic game rather than a fully realized project, the work that's been done by The Odd Gentlemen so far is impressive.\n\nThe actual puzzles are certainly not on the abstract side of the spectrum which is usually the death knell of any point & click regardless of how good its story is. However, In going for accessibility, other than basic movement there is really only a singular interact button which seems somewhat limited with no method for combining objects or other verbs that you'd see in a SCUMM-era game. This could make the challenge of progression seem trivial for more seasoned players.\n\nThere is also a liberal scattering of QTE's & FPS targeting action sequences, which while not as offensive as some would make out don't really add much to the experience. It's very unlikely that players new to point & click games are going to start off with this franchise with more recognisable brands like Walking Dead or Game Of Thrones also on offer, therefore making the game 'accessible' just seems a sure fire way of alienating the already limited audience.\n\nEpisode 1 of a what is set to be a 5 episode series will take you roughly 4 hours to complete. Very much in keeping with the Telltale games model who's recent success it seems the brought back to life Sierra brand is trying desperately to imitate.\n\nHow much you're going to enjoy this title seems dependant on how much nostalgia you have for Kings Quest of days gone by. Despite clear effort going into this product, it just doesn't feel like it has an interesting story to tell or anything new to bring. If there was a middle ground between a yes and no recommendation I would definitely have selected that one.\n\nWhile I wouldn't suggest buying the season pass until it can be judged if they can keep the quality consistent, Episode 1 might be worth a try if you're already well versed in the classic adventure game genre. If this isn't the case, instead I'd recommend one of the more popular Telltale offerings or the recent deluxe remasters of some of the 90's classics such as Grim Fandango, Gabriel Knight or BrokenSword.","October 23, 2015","false","5.9"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

You have to move the protagonist with WASD, so you feel much closer to the character. The realm is super beautiful; nice and warm textures. The puzzles are not the hardest, but very creative. Everything should be clear what you're supposed to do after listening to certain events.\nNow, those "certain events" are mainly based on monologs or dialogs etc. The voice acting is absolutely amazing, every character has its personal voice and shines with their remarkably unique personality.

It also has wonderful animations and art style that feels like its straight out of a fantasy bed time story. fits the story perfectly. The only down side is that it is a bit short. This, however, is to be expected since this is a episodic story similar to the "Tell Tale Games" series. It will become longer and more indebth with each chapter added. I highly recommend this to anyone wanting a start in episodic games.","October 22, 2015","true","14.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

My first PC game was the original King's Quest. From there, I was hooked on Sierra's Quest games. King's Quest, Space Quest, Police Quest, Quest For Glory, Colonel's Bequest, and the list goes on. Sometimes, I'd get nostalgic and replay some of the older games, but there were times where I wanted a new story in some of these imaginary lands of Daventry or following around Roger Wilco, or fighting crime with Sonny Bonds.\n\nThe new King's Quest game, after playing through the 1st Chapter, I can gladly say is as enjoyable as the older games and with the look and feel of a modern point and click Adventure game similar to the Telltale Games adventure games. The artwork is well done, the music and gameplay is fun and the voice acting is pretty good (Christopher Lloyd as an elderly King Graham was pretty cool).\n\nIf you are a fan of the originals - or just want to pick up a great adventure game, definitely get this one.","February 1","true","8.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is just my opinion.\n\nKings Quest is a very colourful adventure-puzzle game with a lot of voice acting. The game feels extremely smooth, especially the controls. You have to move the protagonist with WASD, so you feel much closer to the character. The realm is super beautiful; nice and warm textures. The puzzles are not the hardest, but very creative. Everything should be clear what you're supposed to do after listening to certain events.\nNow, those "certain events" are mainly based on monologs or dialogs etc. The voice acting is absolutely amazing, every character has its personal voice and shines with their remarkably unique personality. It makes the game a lot more lively. In my opinion one of the best adventure-puzzle game I've played (next to Monkey Island and so on..), I'm really looking forward to playing the next chapters.\n\n10/10","December 5, 2015","true","6.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It looked punny and well drawn and I must say it did not disappoint.\n\nUps:\nWell rounded story that keeps you engaged in the game. I finished the first Chapter in one sitting and at no point did the game feel like it was lingering too much, nor was I skipping through it. It provided just the right amount for me to relish in it.\nGood voice-acting. I can't emphasize enough in a game where most of the grip and immersion does not come from action packed scenes, the voices blend in perfectly with the characters and I loved hearing the familiar voices of Gideon Emery and Wallace Shawn, as well as the others.\nWhile my nostalgia drew me towards this game, I treaded carefully as I've been disappointed before by reliving games of my childhood; most times it's not the same as it were back then and you end up tarnished. However, I'm happy to say that King's Quest delivered and oh too well. I had tons of fun running through the chapter, figuring the not so hard puzzles and just sinking myself in the game.\nPuzzles are good. Nothing to write home about, but I feel they are a plus just because they fit in perfectly with the rest of the game's feeling. If they were any harder the game would feel like it drags out and you'd become fed up with it at one point. Any simpler and if you do finish the game up, you won't remember any of it (at least not well).\nI also the love the game let's you f up just the right amount as to not feel like you're being guided through, but enough that at one point I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ I couldn't get the trolls on my side :)\nNot so ups :):\nNow don't get me wrong. The soundtrack isn't bad, I just think that they have so much more room to grow. As above stated this kind of games depend a lot on the athmposphere.\nAlthough the options given to the player when interacting with NPCs are good, I feel like there should be more plot around the player's choices. Maybe give 2 or 3 paths that the player can follow to get to the end of the story. I experienced this feeling even in the small details.  (for example when I decided to steal the Stale Bread for the wheel out of the three choices, that choice was later proven unimportant and the baker even knew it was me; I felt a bit like my choices wouldn't matter. I know they don't really, but you can cheat that feeling out of me :))\n\nConclusion:\nAll in all, I'd give this game a chance if I were you. I know it's niche, but it's very good game for this niche. It's wonderfully designed with little flaws and the feeling you get inside really makes you forget that you're in a Point&Click and more taking part in an adventure. It's goofy, looney, punny and left me with a wonderfull feeling of nostalgia (not the bad kind :))\n\nCheers!","December 26, 2015","true","9.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

King's Quest is a chapter style visual/puzzle based novel about an old King who tells his grand daughter about his  journey as a young teenager, who goes on a long adventure to become the newest Knight of Daventry.\n\nThe game is riddled with puzzles, interesting characters, and amazingly fun storylines. From old chemists who like to lick frogs, to bridge trolls, to heel sharpening royal guards, this game is full of entertainment and truly amazing storytelling(And puns, lots of puns. Don't worry though, you'll warm up to them!)\n\nIt's important to understand that nothing in this game is truly important other than the story told. The graphics are simplistic, the sounds are simplistic, the gameplay is simplistic, but it's all good because the only thing you should really be noticing, is the story!\n\nI'll give you some pros and cons all the same:\n\nPros:\n+Very fun, entertaining story that'll keep you going for hours\n+Fun chain based puzzles that take you across several places in Daventry to find what you need to progress your adventure.\n+Interesting, well-rounded(especially the baker!) characters who have very distinct and unique personalities(Just wait till you meet Kyle and Larry XD I lol'd so hard)\n+Well suffice it to say that the developpers are 'pros!' Get it? (I'm saying there are lots of puns in this game...)\n+Bridge Troll guilds\n+You're a bandicoot, apparently?\n+Buta? Affa Nata! c:\n+Things are dirt cheap. One shiny gold coin for a 5 feet long starshroom pie? HOW DO I GET TO DAVENTRY!?\n+Millions of times better than Undertale.\n\nCons:\n-Simplistic graphics that water down the glorious views you could have of the landscape.\n-Each chapter is relatively short(Manny should know), and there are 5 of them, but you need to pay for each chapter to continue.\n-Lots of backtracking and retracing steps. The puzzles force you to run hither thither and fro to find the pieces needed to continue. It can get sort of frustrating when you're standing with what looks like a pile of junk and you KNOW it's important, but you have no idea how!\n-Scheming fast speaking merchants with goats disguised as unicorns :c\n-Buta? Stalama! :c\n\nOverall, the game's absolutely brilliant, and worth the money the developpers want for it. Now I know you guys don't like that you need to pay $10 for each chapter of the game. But honestly, I'm fine with spending that to motivate the developpers into creating bigger, longer, and better future chapters of this game. Can't wait to see what these brilliant minds come up with next!\n\nBut please, do me a favor: DO NOT. I repeat: DO NOT USE ONLINE GUIDES TO FIGURE OUT THE PUZZLES! It's so much better if you actually figure it out yourself. Cheating, and using the guides, will completely destroy the fun in the game, and provoke negative reviews because, quote 'it was boring and lame, cause I was a 10 year old who wasn't smart enough to figure out the puzzles, boo hoo, rant rant rant'\nSeriously. Do us all a favor, and just play the game with no guides. You'll thank me later.","January 17","true","8.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","3"

After going through it twice, I plan to run through 2 more times, just to explore all the possible dialogue.

But, it hasn't turned out to be that way.\n\nI'm aware that I only played the first part of the game, but even so it felt like it was really short at some points and excrutiatingly long most of the time. Why is that?\n\nBecause the game is designed focusing on the wrong aspects of a Telltale game.\n\nMeaning, instead of creating a pleasant puzzle game where you don't lose any time moving around from one point to the other and filling the whole thing with clever jokes. They've made it all wrong:\n\n.You walk WAY too much in this game and can't even run so you are forced to move slowly.\n\n.The game is full of ridiculous puns that are simply bad and are neither charming nor entertaining. Furthermore, the devs are fully aware of this so they try to mask the fact making jokes out of it which tends out to be redundant in most cases.\n\n.The puzzles aren'r logical and the lack of REAL options in the game doesn't help. You will be told that your choices will have important repercussions in the (near) future but that's just not the case. What you are really given is nothing more than the ilusion of a choice. Because, in truth, you will be forced to walk all the paths regardless of your previous choices. With the exception of some minor decissions that will barely change the story and are not even worth mentioning.\n\n.Yet they've made things even worse making most of the achievements unobtainable on your first run because they're just stupid. Once again, instead of focusing on the multiple choices and rewarding them (even with achievements) they focus on completing various ridiculous tasks that are neither logical nor fun, forcing you to repeat the game a thousand times from the beginning to do something that didn't have any sense at all in the first place.\n\n.King's quest is divided in different chapters but you cannot decide to play specific points of the chapters if you want to. So, in case you missed something you will have to replay the ENTIRE episode from the very beginning, which is absurd and bothersome.\n\n.To make things worse, lots of that in this game, you cannot skip the cinematic-like scenes.\n\n.And last, but not least, the game isn't dubbed in spanish. Which makes no sense whatsoever given the huge spanish community of devoted proud gamers that exists nowadays. By the way, in case you were wondering, there are no spanish subtitles available either.\n\nLong story short, the only good thing I can say about this game is that their characters play their role very well. But other than that I don't recommend playing King's Quest at all even if it costs you 1 €. Unless, of course, you enjoy wasting your time playing dull unproductively boring games, in which case go ahead and give your hard earned money away.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEdit: I just saw a complete walkthrough of Chapter 2 and I it is far worse than the first one. Achievements are rather easier to get though, but you're still required to play the chapter at least twice.","January 1","false","9.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I've always found Princess Rosella (King Grahams daughter)\nand Queen Valencia more interesting! But I guess that is because King's Quest VII was the first King's Quest\ngame I played. I once tried to play the inofficiall King's Quest VIII, also known as The Silver Lining but\nI found the puzzles too hard at that time. That game was also quite pretty and told a story about Graham!\n\nBut less talk about that and more about this!\nWhy was I sceptical now you might ask? Well, the way the trailer showed the game\nmade it look more like a platformer, which it at some times was! But it fitted the game! It\nwas actually a great mix between a platformer and a adventure game! I also feared the game would\ntake upon the modern day adventure game, a.k.a. Telltale Games way of playing an Adventure game.\nIt didn't, atleast not too much, fairly limital actually. Belive me, I have nothing against the Telltale way\nof making an adventure game, and I did look forward to their King's Quest game, but I feel their version\nwouldn't have made it, not like this!\n\nThis got everything spot on, the looks, the sounds, the characters! We even got to see Queen Valencia, or... not see\nbut hear! I do wish we get to see more of the family of which we know and remember so well! This far we've only seen\nKing Graham, and his two grandchildren Gwendolyn & her cousin. (I don't remember his name)\nThe other original characters we get to meet during the game are quite "living", they all have great personalities and\nare taken care of better than most other adventure games.\n\nAnd the story of this first episode, how was it?\nWas it any good? Yeah, it was! The first episode is Graham telling two stories to his young grand daughter.\nThe first is him travelling through the dungeons of where a dragon has his slumber, the second longer one is about\nhow Graham tries to reach knighthood! Both but especially the second are filled with puzzles and funny interactions!\nSo it all comes down to; Do I recommend this game? Yeah I do. I was a bit worried about the high price, it is afterall a episodic game, and if we look at other popular episodic games the episodes are about 1.5 to 2 hours long. Which would have been crazy with this price! However this first episode took six hours for me to complete, which if the rest of the episodes are around the same would be a fair price! There will be a total of five episodes plus and epilogue.\n\nSo for everyone who digs a adventure game, and do note that this is not a point and click adventure game, but more of a "modern" adventure game itself, I do recommend this. I had a laugh, I hope you will to!\n","July 30, 2015","true","33.9"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

BUT, its just as enjoyable.\n\nWhat's the bad news?\nFirst off, I must say it's quite easy to beat in comparison to the old games. Most players have it beaten within 6 hours, and thats mostly because items are easy to find, and the puzzles, as to how you use the items, aren't necessarily challenging. I found myself really "stumped" only once. Also, there's no dead ends, so no need for saves. And as many have said, the Quick-time events are not cool. And unfortunatly there are a LOT of quicktime events. Dealing with repeating dialogue isn't honestly that bad though. I died a fair few times, but re-listening to the dialogue once or twice wasn't near as bad as some make it out to be.\nTo summarize: Easy, no deadends (easy), and QTE's.\n\nSo, why do I reccomend?\nIt's Kings Quest. Through and through. Quirky items, puzzles that are sometimes difficult to piece together, enjoyable characters which are quite memorable, immersive worlds, humor, puns, Daventry, and a great new story. The artwork, animation, music, easter eggs, and voice acting are all bonuses. Sure, gameplay has changed, but I immensely enjoyed every minute and can't wait to play the upcoming chapters as well as play this again with different decisions.\n\nStill on the fence?\nShort and sweet: It's Kings Quest for the first time in 17 years. While you fondle your $10-$40 thinking, I'll be spending my time in Daventry, thoroughly enjoying the nostalgia whilst making new King's Quest memories like I did many years ago!","July 31, 2015","true","43.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

This is such a step in the right direction for Sierra Gaming and the Odd Gentlemen as this game has the stunningly beautiful graphics it deserves. Along with and amazing story line, and a stellar cast of voice actors, this adventure game ranks high on my list of favorites. Chapter One is down right spectacular, and I love the option of multiple outcomes that come with making the hard desicions.\n\nAlas, this amazing feat of story and art is not complete, and due dates are too far away. Once purchasing Chapter One, the Epilogue is now non-obtainable (when it is released) as it comes with the Complete Story and cannot be bought if you have Chapter One in your library already. You can, however, have access to the Epilogue if you purchased the Complete Story right away.\n\nAll that aside, Sierra has won over my heart with this game from the moment of its release and I strongly recommend playing it immediatley (if you enjoy adventure/puzzle style games). If you don't, then who cares! Play it anyways! It's visual splendor and fabulously enjoyable puzzles and characters will win you over for sure!","March 16","true","4.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I am a gamer but also have young toddlers and struggle to share my hobby with them considering the titles in my library.  This was a fantastic choice.  I grew up starting with Kings Quest 5, and immensely enjoy Sierra titles.  The game manages to bring the oldschool fetch-and quest design, without being too easy, or too punishing.  There was no getting stuck as compared to the legacy titles, though it still was a brain teaser at times.  This game does not fill the gap I envy from the experiences of King's Quest VI, which is arguably the best of the series.  However this new installation does a good job diving into a new, different market of gamers.  It has wide appeal, and is a great game that teaches that your actions have consequences, without making you feel like you will be helpless if you make less-than-perfect choices.  "Go with your gut".  The writing is humorous and well done, laced with traditional Sierra style puns and even some pop-culture meme type references.  A lot of people probably didn't recognize a reference to Edward Khils popular "Trolololo" song, while hanging out near the bridge trolls hideout.  I nearly cracked a rib.  I hope they keep up the good work.","February 19","true","12.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

All that said my biggest critique is not of the game but the way it's being sold. I am not a fan of episodic releases even though I understand the reasoning. I think they have done a disservice to a great game.\n\nKeep in mind I am typically the kind of person who doesn't play many point and clicks or story focused games, so the fact that this one kept me to the end leads me to believe it has a charm to it.\n\nI will be getting the rest of them on sale. I still encourage you to at least try the first. I was really impressed.\n\nThe older king's quest games were not entirely before my time, but I never played them. Don't concern yourself with the lack of experience with the universe because it's easily relatable to other fantasy stories.\n\nIf you want a few laughs and a few puzzles that have multiple paths give it a try.\n\nPart 2: Much shorter than the first, but I'd argue it had many more possibilities which is likely why the later parts are taking so long to make. The choices in part 1 did impact 2 in my experience. I look forward to playing more. I disagree with many of the negative reviews.

It is fairly clever in its puzzles and the branching of the game makes it replayable.\nMy only Gripe is I miss the that ability to look at talk to or grab just about anything and get a response.  To dumb the game down for the non adventurers/ first timers they adopted the single action mechanic.  you can only click on relevant items and get only the 1 scripted response.  Personally i miss the more complex system but at least they let you die and cleverly hide it by reloading you from that spot with an explanation by Graham or his daughter gwendolyn as to why.  That mechanic speeds up the game and cures the annoyance of deaths from the original game.\n\nLOVE THIS GAME.

Each chapter is its own story.\n\nGraphics: I love the overall visual design and style of the new King's Quest. Character models look like a combination of beautiful cell shaded animations and elegantly painted caricatures. They really come to life and i enjoy how they really help animate the emotional journey being conveyed in the story. Backgrounds are just as stunning, hand painted, and remind me of live wallpaper for your desktop, except way better. Overall the aesthic nature of this game is top notch.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay of King's Quest is similar to other adventure titles. You get to run around in a world, obtain quirky items and try to solve puzzles and things of that sort to progress the story. I can also say that puzzles are intuitive and make sense, and controls are very fluid and easy to interpret. The end puzzle in chapter 1 can be fairly difficult, but other than that I cannot say I really got stuck on anything for very long, however I contantly felt a nice challenge.\n\nMy first playthrough took me 7.2 hours. It may take you a bit more or less depending on how things click for you. I missed a bunch of achievements which are like hidden details in the game to find. These achievements offer some reply value if you missed any your first time around.\n\nStory: If the title doesn't already give it away, your the king and your telling your grandaughter  a story. These are cutscenes and gameplay is done in the flashback segments, which is most of the game. I loved all the characters in this story, they all really had a place and a purpose. Each character felt unique and brought something genuine to the table in order to help carry the story along. Theres not too much more to say on the subject as that will spoil the best part of the game, however, Christopher Llyod from films such as One Flew Over The CooCoos Nest and BTTF Trilogy ect voices the king as an old man. Its amazing. The rest of the voice acting is done by other notable, recognizable voices you can look up on google ;).\n\nAudio: Besides the voice acting being great the music is really well done and keeps you in the moment and helps build the up environment.\n\nFinal thoughts, great chapter and I cannot wait for all of them to come out. If you don't care about waiting, grab the season pass and you can play chapters 1 & 2!!","December 30, 2015","true","7.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I bought the complete collection knowing that you can't play the epilogue without it, and now I find I can't even play a majority of the game right now.

At the very least I would absolutely recommend anyone and everyone to try out the first EP, it is easily meaty enough to be worth it alone.\n\nFirstly the game itself. It is absolutely gorgeous, very funny(and generally well written) and flows beautifully. The main puzzle area is expansive; there is plenty to do but it is managed and handed out to the player correctly. The puzzles, items, locations and characters all are plenty crazy enough while still making sense in their own context and I didn´t come across any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t moments old adventure games seem to be famous for. I cannot stress enough how effortless going through the game felt while there still was a whole actual adventure game there. The voice acting is great.\n\nNow what really stuck with me from ep1 is how bright, positive and lighthearted it is on the whole. It takes itself seriously and has its serious moments, but it has a truly childrens story-like quality/atmosphere to it that not many games strive for let alone hit as well as King´s Quest does. It doesn´t take the easy way out to please the largely adult audience by having a bunch of snarky dialogue/sarcasm/whatever but goes all in on a true fairytale style and comes out unscathed and better for it.\n\nFinally I have no particular nostalgia towards adventure games. I´ve only played and love certain modern ones (J.U.L.I.A, Morningstar) and naturally the Telltale games(WD S1, Wolf and Tales). And King´s Quest absolutely blew me away in how much prefer it to any of these. As far as I´m concerned King´s Quest looks miles better, is more engaging(thanks to the gameplay), has better characters and straight up has more content presuming future episodes keep it up.\n\nHighly recommended","December 29, 2015","true","9.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Animation, voice acting, story and controls are all top notch. The puzzles are enjoyable and funny, and pretty logical compared to some 90's adventure games where sometimes only way to progress was to try every item in the inventory to every object in the game.\n\nEpisode two is quite a lot different from the first episode. The first episode outshines ep.2, which is way shorter than the first one and felt more like a sidequest between main story quests. It had it's moments though.\n\nEpisode one is a steal at Steam winter sale (0.99€) so grab it now.

I grew up with the King's Quest series.  Alas, I am really not the target audience anymore.  This would be a great game for parents who were fans - it's pitched at what I'd say is around an early- to mid-teen level in dialogue and puzzles, with controls and gameplay that, though relatively sophisticated, have a very low challenge threshold. It's a lot like KQ7, but feels like it's aiming a little younger.\n\nI want to like it. The voice acting is great fun (Christopher Lloyd makes up for a multitude of flaws). But the humor is goofy, slapstick, and pun-heavy, more suitable to Monkey Island than King's Quest. It's like picking up a Xanth book when you hoped for Coville.\n\nAnyway.

I wasn't expecting all that much from it, but what I got was a grand adventure in the best sense. From the little things like being bitten when you stick your hand in a bush to even feeling for characters you only spend a short time with everything in it was been thoughtfully planned.\n\nI'm only 3 hours in to the first episode (chapter 1) but I'm amazed it's actually lasted that long considering it's episodic.\n\n*Gameplay*\nOverall it's very simple, you move around the screen select a few things and do a few puzzles, using your items is a bit weird at first, since you need to go to your menu and select the item instead of having a pop up that says you can use it here (I don't play many puzzle/quest games so I'll assume this is the norm) While not complex, it is very satisifying to play.\n\n*Voice acting*\nSome of the best voice acting I've heard in a game in a long time, with some very famous talent thrown in. The biggest one being that Wallace Shawn (Vicinni, Princess Bride) is in this and just put a huge smile on my face when I noticed it. It also has Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future), And to my surprise Zelda Williams.\n\n*Story*\nNot going to give anything away, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat, which shocked me as I haven't wanted to hear more or see more of a story in a game in a while. If you like silly humor, bad puns and some underhanded jokes you'll enjoy this a lot.\n\nOverall even if I did not get it on sale I would still highly rate this game.","December 28, 2015","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This reboot of an old King Graham telling his granddaughter tales of his adventures is a loving, modern retelling of arguably the greatest adventure game series ever. A fantastic voice cast adds so much depth to each character and the visuals add more to Daventry than ever before, while Chapter 1 is still the only part available its a worthy play for some time away from the real world.","December 4, 2015","true","6.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I will come back to play this game again.  It's one that wins you over as you play it--there are sure to be new fans made with this one.  So punny!  And the musical cues bring me back some years to when I first played this series.  The song in the town square (as you look at the small tree) is the weeping willow song from King's Quest V--callbacks like that made me want to play the old games again.  I found myself just standing in the forest, listening to the score, admiring all that was put into the game to create such an atmospheric feel.

The Game plays like Dragon's lair but looks and sounds like king's quest. Definitely a fusion of both DL and KQ and not too much in one direction which would be my only complaint. I wish this had just a little fairy dust more of Sierra's feel in it, not the puns, or sack of assorted items, they're all there. But the point click and random use elements are a tad shallow, like unlike older KQ games where you can mistakenly use an item wrong and ruin your game run hours down the line, this game won't allow that to happen it will just rewind time for you, (no save states)to the last auto save and let you try again. In that way it feels less dangerous and EPIC in the way the past installments have. But again maybe that's a good thing, the game doesn't break if you don't throw a boot at a cat or pick up a battery. the game doesn't require a full restart to retry which in 2015 is a smart move, people wouldn't stand for a game that has king's quests old difficulty level. They would down rate it and call it horrible instantly rage quit. So understanding they needed to keep these things in mind, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone and friends, In fact i bought it for my brother on steam as a birthday gift because of the nostalgic feel, which definitely came through.

I wasn't expecting all that much from it, but what I got was a grand adventure in the best sense. From the little things like being bitten when you stick your hand in a bush to even feeling for characters you only spend a short time with everything in it was been thoughtfully planned.\n\nI'm only 3 hours in to the first episode (chapter 1) but I'm amazed it's actually lasted that long considering it's episodic.\n\n*Gameplay*\nOverall it's very simple, you move around the screen select a few things and do a few puzzles, using your items is a bit weird at first, since you need to go to your menu and select the item instead of having a pop up that says you can use it here (I don't play many puzzle/quest games so I'll assume this is the norm) While not complex, it is very satisifying to play.\n\n*Voice acting*\nSome of the best voice acting I've heard in a game in a long time, with some very famous talent thrown in. The biggest one being that Wallace Shawn (Vicinni, Princess Bride) is in this and just put a huge smile on my face when I noticed it. It also has Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future), And to my surprise Zelda Williams.\n\n*Story*\nNot going to give anything away, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat, which shocked me as I haven't wanted to hear more or see more of a story in a game in a while. If you like silly humor, bad puns and some underhanded jokes you'll enjoy this a lot.\n\nOverall even if I did not get it on sale I would still highly rate this game.","December 28, 2015","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Especially given all the positive press the game has been receiving. Unfortunately, the game is flat, boring, and slow. I only felt challenged by the "puzzles" once and that was because I was clicking the wrong spot on the screen.\n\nThe voice acting is great. The visuals are interesting. The gameplay is fairly linear and locked onto rails. But it's a REALLY slow game. Your character strolls slowly throughout the world. You can't skip dialogue. You can't skip through animations.  You just have to meander your way through this very flat game.\n\nAll of the reviews centered on the interesting visual style of the game and talked that up. I imagine they must have been paid reviews and, there for, had to highlight something positive about the game. Honestly. It's boring. It's slow. And it's boring. Did I mention boring?\n\nDon't buy this game. If you're an old-school adventure gamer looking for a bit of nostalgia, you will be disappointed by how linear this game is an how little it engages your brain. If you are a new gamer looking to change things up and explore a story driven adventure game, you will be disappointed by how slowly this game is paced and how little it engages your brain.\n\nJust don't buy this game. It's bad.","July 29, 2015","false","17.9"," 94 of 192 people (49%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","49","94","192","9","13"

Unfortunately instead of releasing a full game you have to pay several times to play through each episode. Or pay 40 euro up front for a game of which you have no clue if it will be worth it... you have to wait 6 months to find out.\n\nThe original King's Quest was one of the most iconic adventure game series I know. It had "soul", deep storyline, beautiful graphics and the puzzles I found super hard but challenging to figure out.\n\nThis new addition to the series looks nothing like the old game. While the graphics and atmosphere do seem to be nice in their own right, don't expect to find yourself back in the old King's Quest universe. What you will find is some sort of puzzler and "move-and-jump-around just in time" platformer action. Also the game feels like a movie which is played out for you and every once in a while you get to push some buttons to get the story to continue.\n\nAll in all I would categorise this as mostly a nice kids game and I would not try and play this with the hopes of re-living the old Kings Quest nostalgia.","August 7, 2015","false","1.5"," 14 of 30 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","14","30","0","0"

It was definitely one of my favorite series growing up. This one however, does not stack up very well to its predecessors, or even the genre to which it is supposed to represent. The puzzles are not challenging in the slightest. The interaction with the overworld is pathetic. In the old games you actually had to do some searching and use your brain to find items and solve problems. Now, all you have to do is wander around until a spacebar popup indicates that there is something to interact with. It used to be rewarding when I solved a puzzle. Now it feels empty because of all the spoonfeeding. There wasn't single time where I was lost. I always knew what I had to do next. There were many times when I felt they were overly goofy. They shoehorned jokes in at wrong times. I didn't think it was supposed to be Monkey Island or Space Quest. There was levity in the originals, but in wasn't overdone, and never detracted from what was occurring.\n\n\nBut the game wasn't wholly bad. There are an abundance of nods to the original series, and I had a couple good laughs encountering each one. The voice acting is very well done, the music is good, and I appreciated the art style. I enjoyed the overall narrative (There are a couple really exceptional parts to it) and Graham's granddaughter. She is how I imagine a younger version of Rosella would have been!\n\nSo overall, I wouldn't recommend this game if you are expecting a game similar to the original King's Quest series. 2/5. But for those who have never played the originals, it probably wouldn't be as bad of an experience. I do have the season pass, so hopefully they can continue to make improvements. After you are done go check out the original series. There are free remakes of KQ 1 - 3 (4 is in the works) in the style of 5 and 6 and they should give you a real challenge!","August 15, 2015","false","6.4"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

This makes multiple playthroughs a bit of a pain\n- Keyboard/mouse controls need improving, especially for platform puzzles\n- Options menu is a little lacking\n- Sometimes you get hints for the puzzle solutions way too quickly.

So why is this game so guuuuuddd its because the way of which its presented the way it shoves the player in it doesn't need a tutorial level it doesn't need that garbage all it needs is clever game design im glad that ma bois down at sierra made this happen for example it shows the player a bed in one point of the game out of curiosity most people would click or interact with it this shows the player that you can hide in a bed so later when (spoiler) the dragon comes looking for you, you know what to do and thats hide in the bed its SOOOOO good like the mega mans and guess what ITS FUNNN so buy it most games these days cost 60$ and then they don't work ahem batman arkam knight im looking at you.

It has always been creative as there are different options or methods to clear an area. You play as Sir Graham Cracker, an aspiring lad who wishes to become a worthy knight of Daventry, An adventure filled with fun, puns, and more PUNS. Seriously, it doesn't stop. A pun-filled game with incredible voice actors and actresses that brings life to the old franchise while sticking to the game mechanics that made King's Quest enjoyable. Playing through the intro, I was skeptical at first as it felt linear, but the intro is mainly there to serve as a way to introduce players who aren't familiar with the game mechanics. It is also one of the only games where I enjoy dieing just to see the many ways Graham can die on his adventure. I would suggest to anyone to play this without looking up a guide, it's more enjoyable to figure things out yourself. A very charming, fun, and enjoyable reboot of an old series. The art is very lovely and vivid and I'm amazed at how such an art style can work so well, and even better than the old 8-bit graphics that started in KH1. I can't wait for the next four episodes. The Complete Collection is well worth the price.

All I can say is it's a really fun story to play.","July 30, 2015","true","7.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

And/or do you enjoy classic adventure games? Then this is simply a no-brainer. Let me put any concerns to rest and say that this is a completely worthy follow-up to the legendary series.\n\nIf you're a younger gamer, or the phrase "point-and-click" doesn't stir anything inside of you, the recommendation is a bit trickier.\n\nThe voice work is excellent, art style fantastic (assuming you haven't tired of the Telltale-esque look) and the story and humor on-point. However, there are a couple hiccups that'll frustrate more modern gamers. The pacing is slow, and some innovations like "fast-travel" are definitely missing. The entirety of the game (and really, the genre) is built in  endless backtracking to chip away at the puzzles and places around you.\n\nThe game does many things right, and a few things wrong. But for a follow-up that many of us waited nearly two decades to see (more, assuming you don't count the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized Mask of Eternity), it hits all the right notes. I played the majority of this with a wide-eyed grin. It felt classic. It evoked nostalgia. It kept me interested.\n\nIf you love King's Quest, get it now. If you don't know who King Graham is, this is still a solid title, but I'd do a bit more research before diving in.","July 30, 2015","true","9.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The choices arent as hard or have as big consqueinces you usualy have to pick between the strong path the smart path or the pie path, belive it or not the pie path is the best one by far. This game is amazing to look at the characters are funny and lively and its hard to find all the refrences and jokes they put in this game. The puzzels can be very easy but at times very challengeing and for the most part you never feel like youd need to get a walkthrough even on the harder ones towards the end. alot seem like you may have screwed up which has you keep doing the same action over again till you exploit somthing or finally get a hint or a new dialagouge option.

Quite easy and short. But good. It's not exactly authentic to the original games in some ways, but in atmosphere it certainly is and then adds tons of its own charm that was surprisingly not unwelcome, to a hardcore oldschool King's Quest adventure game fan like me. My concerns and qualms before playing spanned things like not having enough interactions or things to interact with, but one thing this game prove me wrong on was the humour. I had said that it should be more serious and less whimsical. However, after playing it I actually laughed out loud on multiple occassions. I wasn't expecting it to be as funny as it was. It wasn't all humour, but the humour that was there was genuinely funny. I never found even Telltale's games as amusing (I used to be a fan of Telltale in the beginning before they showed their true colours and abhorance for actual adventure game design). So I'll let the humour and whimsy pass because it was done so well. The puns weren't what was funny, either, but I didn't mind them regardless. It does prove that it CAN be serious as well, though, which is a relief (even though that one serious part seemed to come out of left field quite abruptly) and gives me hope for future chapters, especially as Graham gets older.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic, the voice acting superb (not a dry delivery among the actors, except where it was amusingly fitting), the music score and cues are incredible and timed perfectly and intricately to the action on screen, and the pacing is great. It was longer than I expected, but still short and I didn't ever really get stuck. I beat it in 5 hours or so. I took one break after wandering for a bit because I was tired and took a nap. But I was never really stuck. Each solution seemed easy enough. That said, I didn't solve EVERY puzzle immediately either. So it wasn't all flash boom bang done.\n\nIt probably won't happen, but I hope in future chapters TOG will allow us to do more things with more objects. Look at, use, talk, etc with everything instead of just having one interaction per hotspot. Also would welcome extending the puzzle chains a bit. Good easy start so far. Reels both new players and old ones out of practice in. If TOG amped up the difficulty for each chapter as it goes it would show them what a real adventure is again! One other qualm (and the biggest one by far) is that there is no way to skip dialogue or cutscenes you've already heard/watched. This needs to change.\n\nI don't need fast travel like everyone's saying in reviews. I enjoyed getting around just fine. I would like to see more large and beautiful grand scenes, though, even bigger than we've seen so far. I'm thinking something from the perspective of the town in KQ5 where characters are very small but with more to do and more areas to see than just the three shops in that town in KQ5. Just less roads. I think that's the biggest issue people might have. Wandering and exploring is fun but all the roads connecting them are uninteresting and make the world seem small, ironically. But I still don't welcome fast travel. The areas and graphics in general are very pretty. Skipping exploration and avoiding wandering around would be like playing Jurassic Park The Game by Telltale (which cut out walking altogether...MISSING THE POINT!!!).","August 14, 2015","true","11.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theskozo/recommended/345390/","theskozo","TheSkozo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theskozo/","252 products in account","Let me paint a picture for you....well anyone who is above the age of 25 or has a love for watching classic 80's movies, but I digress. The Princess Bride, a Movie about a Grandfather telling a story to his grandchild about fantasy, love, and friendship. Oddly enough King's Quest could almost be given the same synopsis, minus the love portion. There may be no love interest in this game, but  The Odd Gentalmen defiently put nothing but love into this game, and it shows.\n\nFor as much of a homage as there is to the Princess Bride, there is so much this game does on its own that captivates you in so many ways. The biggest thing is the world it paint, and creates for you in a majestic 2D animated art style much like Disney movies of old, but with a 3D flair to it that works in harmoney. There are a lot of games out there today that use a similar style to this, like Street Fighter, Boarderlands or even the TallTell games to an extent. The difference here is those other games are more of a 3D animated world with a 2D overlay, this game is a 2D world, with 3D movements. This is very hard to pull off, but they get it right, without faulter through out the game.\n\nThis is very much a "New" version of the point and click genre. Simple controls to the point that you are only using the left joystick to move, one button to interact, one button to open your bag and a third button for quick time events. I have seen people complain how this games controls are too simplistic, but remember, this is supposed to be a "New" point and click game. In the good old day point and click games where pretty much just the use of a mouse and the buttons on the mouse. This is a good things and a bad thing however. Bad thing because we are so used to complecated controls that for a bit of time, you will be trying to use the right mouse stick to rotate a camera or just do something, even though it does nothing. However after a couple minutes you with fall into it with no problem, which is part of the good thing about the controls. They are easy to pick up and go with.\n\nThis first chapter is atleast 5 hours, and when you first start to play it will feel very linear, with only one path to go most of the time, with very simple puzzles. However this is because for the first hour or so, you are actually playing a well craft tutorial level that will show you everything you will need to know, by the time the game gives your free raine around the world. You will know when you have broken free of the tutorial level when you are now able to go down 3 paths here that lead to two paths here that go over there and come back over here, and such like this. It opens up and requires you to remember how to get around the game, which really gives you the time to admire the landscape.\n\nThe most important thing to this game though, are the characters, and the story. This game has some of the best designs of characters we know of from fair tales and other such games, but with a twist. When you come across a creature you reconize by name from somewhere else and then see how they have been designed for this game you will just smile and fall in love with them, very much like I have. The story helps you fall in love with these characters personalities and gives you a reson to care, or hate, or wish you had done things differently. The puzzles can be challanging or they can be simple, but you do them because they add a flavor to the story and helps move everything along at a nice pace. I dont want to ruin anything about this story, but its handle with great care, and attention to detail.\n\nWith the minor flaws anyone can find in a game, and harp all day on to make a game look trashy and bad, I choose not focus on them, mostly because really there just arnt many there to begin with. The story is everything about this game. Its fun, challenging at times, makes you laugh, and if you have watched the Princess Bride, there are some amazing references that will hit home with you, in the most amazing of ways.\n\n9.5/10 - Recommend everyone play this game","August 10, 2015","true","8.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

Not only is it great for old fans to re-live the past in this new art style it also introduces new players to the story us old fans already know, but also tosses in a few new stories like how he became a knight.\n\nI really like the new stories as well as re-visiting what I already know because it's done differently.\n\nOverall the game is a real joy. It just gets very flusterating when you are as bad at quick time events as I am.

If a three-line dialogue pops up on screen when you look at a road sign, then you get to spend 10 seconds listening to the (awful) narrator read it to you, even if you can read it yourself in a fraction of that. God help you if you accidentally click that thing again.\n\nHalf of the fun of the original King's (and especially Space) Quest was finding ways to die, since the animations were often funny or gruesome, and typically had mocking quips from the narration. The deaths in this game are dull and sanitary. They use Prince of Persia: Sand's of Time's "wait, that's not what happened" reload gimmick, but the KQ narrator is unpleasant to listen to. Adding insult to injury, dying means reloading and being forced to watch unskippable cutscenes again, so I quickly lost my desire to find ways to die.\n\nThe puzzles are cake. There's no satisfaction in clicking on the only usable thing on the screen and watching a cutscene. The one time I felt some tension to solve a puzzle, the game dissolved it immediately. After recovering the magic mirror from the dragon, the dragon notices you. I started thinking of how I would get away, but it didn't matter; Cutscene Graham handled it himself with what could've been a fun little puzzle sequence. After that, the game turned into a rail shooter with quick-time events, and then more boring cutscenes with unskippable dialogue.\n\nDon't bother.","May 30","false","0.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

This however just seems to be (as other reviewers have mentioned) nothing more than a bunch of quicktime aciton sequences.\nHalf the fun (or is that frustration) of the original Sierra game/s was to use the typing system to determine you surroundings and to find a solution to your problem.\n\nThis looks too much like that horrid Dragons Lair game of the 90's that invaded pinball parlours with pretty graphics and non existant playability. If you're feeling nostalgic like I was,  and remember the original, grab the first chapter for free. It only got about 20 minutes of my time and just didn't emote the same childhood enjoyability of the original.\n","May 25","false","0.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

But the fact it was the King's Quest serious hit me particularly hard. It was hands down one of my favorite series of games growing up. Easily one of the most influential it was the first time I recall actually caring what happened to the pixelated dude on my screen.\n\nI refused to be involved in it. I knew nothing I said or could do would stop it but I wouldn't even acknowledge it. And then I heard that Christopher Lloyd was going to be involved. He is without a doubt my favorite actor. And then I heard Tom Kenny, and Wallace Shaw and WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON HERE!?!?! So I decided to check it out. And I got excited. But I've been burned in the past so whenever I saw it pop up in my steam queue I'd click on past it. Until yesterday when I pulled the trigger.\n\nI was IN DAVENTRY AGAIN!!!!!! It's not a rehash of the old series, this is CLEARLY made by fans for fans and has all of the charm of that silly little 8 bit game paired with the BREATHTAKING beauty that today's modern gaming allows. Actually to compare it to modern gaming isn't fair. Most games today, the scenery is just there to make the levels more interesting as you breeze past and shoot the next unknown random person in the face.\n\nThis game is a work of art. From the talented acting of Mr. Lloyd, Mr. Kenny, Mr. Keaton, Mr. Wallace, and .... Miss Williams. That's right, Robin Williams daughter. The one that when she was born was named Zelda because of her dad's love of adventure games, is the voice of Amaya Blackstone.\n\nThis, game producers is how you relaunch a series. This is lovingly detailed and an homage to the original while being a beautiful masterpiece fitting of the King's Quest name. I *HIGHLY* recommend you purchase this and I look forward to many more adventures to come from these guys.

Younger Me loved the puzzles, the fairytale settings, and the humor with which each game was presented (yes, even the puns). Older Me appreciated the care taken with the writing and presentation of the games (yes, even the endless parade of 'how-you-died' messages - perhaps especially those).\n\nSo far, King's Quest has managed to retain the things I loved about its namesake while introducing features I crave in present games, particularly choice-and-consequence. The graphics have improved, the gameplay runs more smoothly, and the player now often has a chance to elect how they want Graham to solve a given problem, but the game remains true to the spirit of the original series and successfully manages to flesh out Daventry's history with new stories and characters without having to rewrite the tales loved by older fans. The punny humor and numerous ways to die remain intact, augmented by a clever Bastion-esque narration scheme that has the voice of Christopher Lloyd dictating what is happening, what could have happened, and what he knows will happen if the player follows a particular action. (My advice: ignore his advice. Death is no consequence in this game and it is infinitely more amusing!)\n\nFans of the old series aside, I feel the game holds up on its own. It has a forgiving system that seems designed to mitigate the frustration of death -> lose progress -> sigh -> reload, instead opting to encourage experimentation at little to no expense to the player. While there are a few serious moments, the overall tone of the game is light-hearted and the narrative feels both accessilble to and enjoyable by all ages, with a nice blend of jokes and plot points targeted toward various audiences.\n\nWhether dusting off your old adventuring hat or trying this genre for the first time, King's Quest gets my recommendation. I am looking forward to the remaining episodes.","July 29, 2015","true","37.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

I figured the game would be a quick cash-grab, offering nothing of the soul of King's Quest, but simply the skin.\n\nHow wrong I was. This game is the natural successor to King's Quest V, VI and VII; It is the King's Quest 8 we never got. It is as good as 6, but in a totally different way; While it is not a romantic tale, it is a moving coming-of-age story with lots of humor, along with some dark moments as well. The game features some frustratingly fun puzzles, amazing music, great voice acting as well as engaging and interesting NPCs; it offers exciting, brand new stories while staying true to the established King's Quest lore - yet this game is not tied to the series' past, nor is it bound up in nostalgia.\n\nIt is a fun experience - fun for the young and fun for the old - I would recommend it not only to veterans of the King's Quest series or adventure games, but even to those who've never played either - there is something here for everyone.\n\nI am truly surprised to be writing this - but if this level of quality continues over the next four chapters, this will be the best King's Quest game ever produced.","July 28, 2015","true","19.2"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

(I'm looking at you pumpkin squirrels!)\n\nAside from the PC version being a direct port from Xbox (I assume since there are A, B button icons that show up sometimes in inventory menu without a purpose), this has been the best adventure game I have played since The Day of The Tentacle during the original era of puzzle questing. There are some elements in the tutorial that reminds me of tomb raider's latest realtime action features which add to the new era puzzle quest genre in a fun way.\n\nTo everyone looking for the original feel of King's Quest just play through until you get to Graham and his trusty steed, then the real collecting puzzles quests begin.\n\nSome have criticized not being able to look when they want when they want, these people are not used to the side scroller 2-D world we grew up with. I enjoy the feel and flow that new technology has added to the existing gameplay style.\n\nThe only negative I have for replayability is the inability for skipping either unwanted narration or the extended cutscenes.\n\nThe auto save only is a unique way of saying, "we know when you are going to fail so here is a safety net," which can be good for new players, bad for trial and error extremists.\n\nThe art and music are pristine and a divine tribute to the original series.\n\nOverall my hat is off to you in resurrecting a dying franchise with a great memory building series starter.\n\nChapter 1 took me about 6 and a half hours (the first time through without outside help). I enjoyed the puzzles and it took me back to the old story telling puzzletry games.","July 28, 2015","true","39.6"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

I've always enjoyed to a certain degree the Tell Tale adventure games (Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us" but they've always felt like they were more interactive movie than game. I always loved playing the old King's Quest games as a kid, and I have fond memories of wandering around and exploring the various wonderful landscapes and strangew worlds. This game keeps the elements that work from the new adventure game trends, but brings back the ability to freely roam that l always loved. To me that's where the sense of adventure comes in. Wandering around and interacting with the world.\n\nA special nod has to go to the voice acting which is superb. Christopher Lloyd knocks it out of the park as the elerly King Graham, and the whole world is brought to life with convincing and humourous work all around.\n\nThe first chapter took me about six hours to complete, and think I'll definitely be going back to try different things and mess around in the beautiful hand painted world. If you played the older king's quest games, or are just a fan of adventure games, I highly recommend this game!","July 29, 2015","true","45.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

This game is absolutely beautiful, and the story is fantastic.  I absolutely enjoyed playing it except for these two things;\n\n1.  Controls for the game on PC are wonky, you almost have to play it with a controller.\n2.  DLC chapters.\n\nI actually managed to finish chapter one with out a controller so that is really not a big deal, but it was a little off putting to me.  DLC for games is ruining the gaming industry, and is over all toxic.  Which is why I will be personally boycotting the rest of the chapters for this game.  Chapter one earned a 9/10 for me, but the game as a whole is a do not recommend for DLC chapters.

For a King's Quest game I expected a lot more than what was offered here and the fact that it's episodic doesn't give me a lot of confidence in the product; it makes it feel like an incomplete experience. The feeling is all the more apparent when there's little to no point and click interaction with the world itself and there's none of that very detailed and often times important narration that helps build the world and really give the game a sense of character.\n\nHowever the cast that is present in the game is nothing short of fantastic with voice actors that should be immediately familiar and do a great job. I guess that's what really stands out in the game, the characters themselves. Being a younger and learning Graham is a very interesting take on the series and at the same time we get a glimpse of what's happened to him as he's now an old man with many stories. In a way it does worry me about the future of this game as there's not really ever a sense of peril and urgency because you know you're going to someday end up as an old man telling stories to his grandaughter; it's certainly nothing like being in the moment when Mordak has wisked away his family in King's Quest V.\n\nI know this is a relatively new studio and they have big shoes to fill while at the same time not trying to play off on nostalgia and go their own way with the series. This is a very interesting world, but I want more. On the more positive, this game has a lot of heart and a lot of charm; I had a big grin on my face almost the whole time I was playing it ^^\n\nSo TLDR; it's a cautious recommendation. I'd probably wait until you can get the complete experience. As for those that experienced Chapter 1 anyway, I'd wait until I see if there's much more in Chapter 2 or even build off on Chapter 1 and expand the possibilities of what to do and where to go on this crazy adventure.","August 2, 2015","false","5.2"," 14 of 32 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","14","32","0","0"

Loved them since the days of the likes of Day of the Tentacle, Sam and Max, Monkey Island, Discworld, Simon the Sorceror (thought I should mention at least a couple off non-Lucas ones just to show that other companies were actually capable of making good ones).\n\nWhat I'd suggest to the makers of this game is, can you please go back and play some of the above mentioned titles? Then make a game that actually fits in that genre?\n\nThe problems with this title are numerous but first I'll tell you what things it at least does better than the recent Telltale fare which it is trying so desperately hard to copy. I think it's only fair to review it in this way since they chose to design it this way.\n\n1. Animation. Whilst I think the graphics themselves, if you take a still screenshot, are pretty much identical to the quality of recent Telltale works, the animation is a huge improvement. Telltale's animations are janky and horrible, they are trying to be cartoonish and stylised but it never works and comes down with a serious case of Uncanny Valley. King's Quest, on the other hand, seems to have taken some lessons from proper cartoon animation and the characters move around in a really nice way, usually with exaggerated movement and humour. This is perfect for the art style they have gone with and is a solid part of the production.\n\n2. Voices (and dialogue). Well, it would be hard for them to go wrong with some of the big names they got behind this, although Christopher Lloyd is doing a bit too much of the kindly old grandpa for my tastes, rather than delivering his lines with any wit or agency. Still this is so much better than Telltale whose voice direction generally makes me cringe. The actual writing of the lines is far far better, still leaving something to be desired, but a lot of Telltale's dialogue is just plain unforgivably bad, especially when dealing with a property like Game of Thrones which, y'know, is quite well known for having awesome writing on the TV.\n\nAnd unfortunately that's it. They've managed to actually make gameplay even worse than TTG. Yes there are the familiar elements that I love to hate in the modern crop of adventure games, such as QTEs and WASD controls, action segments, entirely linear plot and exploration (no matter how much they claim to have a branching storyline), puzzles that can't really be classed as puzzles when it's basically "press A to continue". But they've somehow managed (and this is really truly impressive when I think about it) to bring all these elements together in an even worse, less consistent, and more linear, redundant and patronising way than even TTG manage.\n","August 25, 2015","false","1.0"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

There's potential, but it misses the mark in a few small and big ways and I can't recommend it for most people.  However, it's definitely worth a look if you have children or younger family members.\n\nSlightly longer:\n\nThe 2015 King's Quest is a mixed bag, but not one that I can recommend for most players.  Graphically, the game feels very last-generation (except, bizarrely, for the cape animation) with few options to choose from.  Just the ability to enable some higher anti-aliasing would have been nice as the game is pretty jaggy.  It's obvious that the developer is trying to ape the Telltale style, but there's a level of charm in the animations and writing which don't hit their goal... which is unfortunate because King's Quest is desperately -- gaspingly -- trying to be charming.  They overdo it.\n\nThe gameplay is incredibly linear and patronizing (a bit simple even by Telltale standards), the tone is forcefully schmaltzy, and I can only begin to express how BRUTAL it is that the game lacks a dialogue/animation skip.  Seriously, the fact that you can't skip anything just puts a huge spotlight on all the flaws.  The dialogue, which is inherently (mind-numbingly) repetitive, grates after just the second time.\n\nI'll say this: the lack of outright failure does NOT bother me and the way that's handled with the narrative device is genuinely inspired.  I hated in old adventure games when I could die or completely screw myself over because I didn't do a small thing earlier in the game.  I'll never miss that, and I don't think that King's Quest is missing anything by being "easy."\n\nI also got the sense that the publisher is eying an eventual mobile release.  There's just something about the structure of the world, and its controls, and its options, and it's graphics that tells me a mobile release is in the future.\n\nIt's not all bad.  It's not even mostly bad.  If you're looking for a game that can be played by your children, this probably hits that sweet spot.  While it's difficult to call this game an “homage” to the Princess Bride, since through sheer quantity of lifted elements it can only be called a ripoff, nonetheless the core story beats and voice acting are a cut above.  I expected Christopher Lloyd to come off as depressingly old, but his performance is actually perfect for his character.  The only character that annoyed me was the granddaughter, Gwendolyn.  She's such a well-worn trope, a cliche, that it had me rolling my eyes whenever she chimed in or we got a glimpse of her B-plot.\n\nThere's a potential to this new King's Quest that goes unrealized, but it's there.  It's enough that I haven't completely written off future acts, but I'm not counting the days.  A Steam sale and a dialogue skip might be enough to sway me.  Until then, I can't recommend this game to most people... but if you have children, give it an honest look.","September 2, 2015","false","5.1"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

You need to look at it as more of a re-imagined modern version or even just a game on its own.\n\nKing's Quest so far from what I have played and seen from others is providing an experience that is rich in story and filled with great voice acting and quirky remarks. If you die there is always a funny dialogue behind why you died as Graham is talking to his granddaughter. Sometimes you press on an item more than once and the dialogue will change and remind you that there is STILL not time for that action.\n\nWhat I love about the game so far is simply the feeling it gives me when playing it. I am always looking for a game to challenge my mind and make feel enthralled by the world and atmosphere of the game. I love the environments, colors, music, voice acting and characters so far and I have heard it only gets better. Super excited. Must play more.\n\nI will try to provide more in-depth analysis as I play through the game. It seems to be around 6-8 hours or so to play through the game. Sounds like a great amount of game for the price. I bought the collectors edition and I am so glad the game turned out to be quite fun and will fill my spare time up nicely.\n\nThen we just need to wait for the next episode. No words on when that is coming yet, though.\n\nUpdates later on.

Graham walks to well just fine, then when I try to get in position to pull the bucket up the well by pressing the space bar, Graham does a strange dance back and forth for about 3-4 minutes... back and forth, back and forth... finally, he gets into position so I can pull the bucket up by using the crank. Then... next walk over to the well and press the space bar again... this time Graham does another dance. I gave up at this point. It doesn't work. I don't know if there are memory issues or what, but I'm really disappointed as I wanted to play this game with my daughter. I hope there is a fix... if not, might try to get my money back.","July 31, 2015","false","2.7"," 36 of 82 people (44%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","44","36","82","4","0"

I've played the original games in the 1980s and early 90s, and now this.  I love the way the story is going so far, the voice acting is wonderful, and the game is beautiful.  I love the action sequences.  I really enjoy how it breaks up the adventuring, but I feel the controls could be better.  I'm playing on a fast PC with an XBOX One controller.  When jumping from rock to rock during the dragon fire sequence, it felt like a struggle, especially when trying to go on a diagonal.  While the game is beautful --  and I understand how it's meant to look like a cartoon, the game does nothing to push modern graphics hardware.  My GTX 770 barely heats up.  I doubt this game would even challenge older consoles.   There could be more movement in the backgrounds which almost seem static at times.  While there are some particles floating around in some screens, there could be more... a lot more detail everywhere.  This is especially noticiable after just getting done playing the 2013 reboot of Tombraider.  I know, different game, different design, but I was expecting more.  I would love for the player to be able to control the camera so we could see more of these beautiful scenes in every direction.   King's Quest IV has always been my favorite.  One of the things that made IV so great, was the music (as heard on the Roland MT-32).  Composer William Goldstein really hit it out of the park with that soundtrack.  So much so, that 27 years later, the melodies are still stuck in my head.  The music is very well done in this new game, but I feel it lacks melodies that would really make it a hit.  Overall, wonderful game, but was expecting just a bit more in the graphics and music department from a title that previously set the course for computer gaming more than 30 years ago.","August 4, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you want to go back you need to delete and start from the beginning. No need for such stupidity when it even has multiple save slots!\n2) Make sure you get the Complete Edition else you don't get the Epilogue. Another stupid designer choice. Are they allergic to money? Should be two ways to buy the game. Chapter by chapter or complete. Season pass without Epilogue shouldn't even be an option. Just leads to people buying it by accident and being very angry when they can't see a whole end chapter.\n3) Desperately needs a way to click past conversations you've heard many many times over.

The traditional "hand, eye, dialog, item" control of the old point and click was a tried and true mechanic. I don't see any reason to deviate from the old formula.

An array of talented actors voicing each character, such as Christopher Lloyd as and older King Graham, Josh Keaton as a younger Graham, and other notable voice talent such as Tom Kenny and Wallace Shawn. The game follows a fashion of story telling reminiscent of "The Princess Bride." In that, you control young Graham in his adventures narrated by an older Graham, who is telling his stories to his grandaughter Gwendolyn.\n\nThe only thing that may turn off seasoned King's Quest players is that the puzzles aren't as difficult as in older games, and as of the first episode, there aren't many ways to die. However, there is still a lot of fairly good humor in the game to make up for it.

I loved them then, i love them now. I really like Telltales' take on things with their different enterprises and Broken Age was also great. I'm super excited for the different Kickstarter projects and that people actually want them to happen.\n\nI did not really know what to expect from King's Quest. I actually didn't really play it back in the day, but in my opinion most Sierra games shared the same feeling but in different settings. So I took a chance and bought the whole season pass, in worst case it was nothing more than a minor endorsement for this ridiculed-into-oblivion-genre.\n\nSo the first surprise was that it clearly was made for controllers, not so much point and click. Luckily I own a xbox controller for the PC and can also play from on my TV via HDMI. The overall feeling is that it works best on console, which isn't so strange as most recent (if not all?) adventure games got a console release. My view is also that the console works fine for these quite slow-paced gamed. Of course I enjoy it more laying down on the couch, that's the best position for solving puzzles!\n\nI think I will skip the game details and get to the conclusion right away. This game is great! It does not feel like a remaster or something, it feels like a new fresh game. The action sequences does not make it worse, it makes it better! And as far as I understand these sequences was in the original game (probably more or less impossible :D) so why argue with that? The story is great, the characters are great, the humour is also great! While playing I sometimes thought it was a 10/10 as it felt fresh and updated in a way I had not seen before, that might be a slight exageration but I'd definitely give it 8 or 9, and I'm not even done with the first chapter!\n\nThe first game that came in mind while playing was actually not a Sierra game but Discworld, I think the graphics and general feel got me to make that connection. Otherwise it might be valid to compare it to the more recent releases, Deponia. Which is a great hommage but also stays at that, doesn't really get it's own identity, and rarely makes you smile in the way King's Quest got me smile (and actually laugh!). I also think that King's Quest makes the journey better than Broken Age manages, and I really enjoy Broken Age as well.\n\nAll these games are very dear to me and I love these remasters and remakes that's happening. My greatest dream is the REAL comeback of old adventure games! Where kids go YES MONKEY ISLAND IS TEH BEEEEZ! Haha, yes I'm old and getting older :-D\n\nSo for all of you that love this genre for the same reasons as I do, buy this, you won't be disappointed! Now we can only hope the rest of the season is as good! The rest of you who like the genre but can't get with controllers and consoles, I actually think you'll like it too, IF you can get over these bumps and not sit and scream "why isn't everything as it was in 92!!!" :-) I think this kind of game MUST be cross-platform to even survive it's not like it's Battlefield or something... One thing I'd like though is to be able to play the same game on all platforms, with one license, not one for PC, one for PS4, etc etc.\n\nHurry up and buy!","August 5, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And was sorry to see the adventure series start to die out.\n\nHowever i am happy to see that this New Kings Quest game lives up to the tradition started by Sierra and have hope that other Sierra classics will be remade.\n\nI have read some of the reviews online and and deal with some of their comments. First is the inclusion of quick time events, many people have issues with them, however unlike other games you have "more time" to press the correct button. Second your movement around the world seems to be geared for gamepads or touchscreens. however this is a 3d world and i will address this later. Finally some reviewers seem to talk about the copy and paste nature of story ideas.\n\nOne of the things that made Sierra games spectacular are the graphics.(this was the 90's after all) so i was very pleased to see detailed enviroments and stunning views even though they are little more than eye candy. Having multiple "enviroments" that you need to navigate through(multiple times) is also a callback to the classic Sierra games. This allows you to explore the enviorment and at times take a break from solving one puzzle to focus on another. The need to use a keyboard or gamepad is a departure from the classic Sierra games where you could do everything with a mouse. Hopefully this function will be included shortly.\n\nIf you have ever played the classic Sierra games you would know that bad puns and cultural referenceses are the norm. Also making a mistake and dying is also a possibility(and the games way of telling you that the game is no longer winable) so these games do  copy the source material as intended. The best example of this is Manny copied from "the princesses bride" movie. While not a direct copy it does give you a clue as to what type of person he is and what you might expect when you have to face him.\n\nAll in all this is a fairly faithfull relaunch of a classic game that put video games(and graphics) on the map.\n\n","August 5, 2015","true","113.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To start with, this game has character to it. It's not just your run of the mill simple fantasy world, but it's wacky and funny with little surprises and jokes throughout. This game really excels in its story telling. It uses your choices and many narrative devices to make you feel more attached to the characters in the story. Puzzles aren't too hard really, they just require a lot of exploration. I'm very excited to see what the next few chapters will hold, and even if they aren't very good, this chapter stands well enough on its own to warrant your purchase.","August 5, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The QTE are not that hard to do and I'm normally not very good at them so there wasn't much of an issue. And if you do die you pop back up right before it happens, but sometimes it's right before a cutscenes that you will have to watch for a second time. There is a few different ways to do things to get throught the game, great for replayability but sucks that the game only has an autosave function so you can't go back to change what you did.

Also, I'm not an extensive player of Adventure type games; I've played The Wolf Among Us, Year Walk, and, if these count, Dear Esther and The Stanley Parable. This should give you a fair idea of my experience and expectations for King's Quest. Having said this, I really enjoyed this first chapter of the game.\nKing's Quest: A Knight to Remember, is sort of an adventure game. I say "sort of" because it doesn't fit the usual mold I expect for the majority of adventure games. It isn't point'n'click, nor are there obtuse puzzles to solve. While playing I felt like there was some familiarity in gameplay to The Wolf Among Us, however there were a few differences.\nThere is a heavier influence placed on your inventory items in King's Quest, and while there are story choices to be made, they don't feel altogether that consequential, at least in this first chapter. Further, the gameplay has some interesting elements, such as a few first-person rail shooters segments that stand out, among other fun (but short lived) moments.\nA Knight to Remember does contain a fair number of puzzles, but they don't ever feel too unreasonable or illogical - most of the puzzles make sense. I found there was some thought required, but never in a way that was potentially frustrating or that could derail the pace of the game. This is good, because it fits well with the light-hearted nature of the game.\nThe visuals of King's Quest are excellent. You could certainly draw comparisons to several Telltale games, such as the aforementioned The Wolf Among Us or The Walking Dead, but I find the aesthetic of this game to be much more colorful - this is especially apparent in some of the water-color inspired backdrops.\nOverall, King's Quest is fun, light-hearted, not too challenging, and beautiful. The story and dialogue are done nicely, and I enjoyed the few hours of entertainment I got out of this chapter. I'd recommend it, for sure.\n","August 8, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Time has changed, long challenging quests are gone, no one will now spend a few days to solve a puzzle to advance one step. And to save the game every five minutes, because if you miss something, you find yourself at an dead end.\nBut the developers have done the impossible. They changed everything, but kept the main thing. This is not the King Quest of our childhood, but nevertheless, it's a real King Quest. The same humor, the same charming characters, the same kingdom of Daventry.\nThe graphics are very good. Voice acting is beyond praise.\nStrongly recommend.","August 9, 2015","true","42.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoyed the first chapter so much that I ended up playing it three different times to see the consequences of various decisions you can make. It's perhaps a little slow for the completionist, but I thought it was amusing enough to make it worth sitting through again.

What people dont know if they didnt grow up on Kings Quest is that you have to do the right things in the right sequence.  If something doesnt work go back and try something else.  Think outside the box.  I really like them bringing in characters and jokes from movies from my Era.  Manny resembles the guy with the lisp in the princess bride movie.  Amyra resembles the female companion of Harrison Ford in Raiders of the lost ark.  My fav is when the guards are talking about the new addendum 867530-lol 9 just like the song in the beginning of Chapter 2.  It was enjoyable but make a bang out Chapter 3 please.\n\nSomething you didnt know but back when there were floppy disks my brother changed all the responses in the game and he added a few fancy words and responses of his own.

With it's modern animation style graphics, excellent characters and a fun story it feels more like a Pixar movie than a video game.  The characters have amazing voice acting including quite a few little pop-culture references often with the characters from the original material that is being referenced (such as competing in a battle of wits against Wallace Shawn from The Princess Bride).  This is not just a quest game though and it includes some arcade style action sequences, a hilariously awesome horse race and the aformentioned battle of wits, which plays out like a chess game.  The backgrounds are stunning to look at and, even with a slightly less than powerful laptop like I'm running, the levels of texture is astonishing.  The court and countryside of Daventry are amazingly rendered and, in many cases, are actually laid out in a similar way as in the original series.\n\nVery Highly Recommended!!!!","October 4, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My dad and I used to play the original game together, and the game nicely updates the story telling, graphics, and interface for the 2015.  Certainly a fun challenge, and there are multiple (MULTIPLE) ways to approach puzzles, often in nonlinear ways that affect your options for solving future puzzles without you even knowing it.\n\nStorytelling reminds me of the new 'Bastion' game, and (no spoilers) the dynamic between player and storyteller likely sets up some important plot development in later chapters.  The game also is not afraid to make fun of itself or the archaic adventure text genre, which makes for some good laughs.\n\nIf you're good at puzzle adventure games, you can complete Chapter 1 in under 10 hours but there's plenty of replay value as there are MULTIPLE ways to solve the story, but not in the 'you know you're about to make a plot choice that will affect the world one way or the other' that is common today.  For example, my Dad was asking me for a hint because he was stuck after fighting (no spoilers), and I didn't even know (no spoilers) was in the game on my playthrough.  Your choices can be that subtle, but that game-changing.\n\nMy only concern is whether the other Chapters will actually be released in a timely manner.

Even though the puzzles were really easy, I was sometimes too dumb to understand what I was going to do.\n\nThe characters are lovely and always manages to bring a smile on your face, especially the main character. Graham is a lovable character and I love his clumsy ways of solving problems.\nThis makes me really excited for the other chapters! Hopefully they will be just as good as this one.\n\nOverall the game was fantastic and I'm soon going to buy the rest of the chapters.\n\nThank you~\n\n**** Highly recommended ****","August 22, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They're simple, they're not satisfying or good in terms of gameplay, and if you're looking for any mechanical depth at all look elsewhere.  And I'd say there's a bit too much backtracking while you figure things out.  It's pretty standard point and click stuff on that front.\n\nBut as someone who thinks point and clicks are lazy/bad games with (usually) no logic behind the puzzles, I still enjoyed this one.  Enough to buy the season pass.  Because it does what the good point and clicks do and turns itself into an interactive movie.  The game really shines because it's charming.  It's got a Disney/Princess Bride vibe, and that's what sells it.\n\nNo nostalgia here... I played the opening of Kings Quest 3 or 5 way way back in the day and never got past the first puzzles.  I was too young.  And I think that's important to know.  I have no warm fuzzy memories of this series, but I would buy this again.","August 25, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However I would say that the game was true to the kind of puzzles in the original games which the author of that article also did not like.  Where I really enjoyed playing this game was that it was so simple that I can sit down with my 6 year old and we could work through the simple problem solving pieces and it had a simple storyline to follow.\n\nI did only play it with a controller and some of the scenes where more dexterity was required could have been tuned for that experience better and apparently the wasd controls weren't much better.  However the length of the cut scenes leading into the gaming segments was not usually too long and there was a plethora of bad puns and jokes about how he got around dying in the game that were family friendly.\n\nAll in all I would say it is definitely not for everyone, however I would say that it has a place and it provided me with an excellent opportunity to have my kids come down and work through simple logic problems and puzzles, at times taking the controls, and have a positive collaborative experience with my children.","September 13, 2015","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think it really does succeed at capturing the spirit of what was good in the original King's Quest games, but avoids most of their problems at the same time. All of the puzzles felt fair to me; I didn't need to check a guide to figure any of it out. I enjoyed the first chapter so much that I ended up playing it three different times to see the consequences of various decisions you can make. It's perhaps a little slow for the completionist, but I thought it was amusing enough to make it worth sitting through again. Very good musical work in this too, lots of little orchestral moments that synchronize perfectly with your actions.

If you want to "save" a game, you have to quit it (and have it revert to the last time it autosaved), copy the file to one of the other 3 save slots, and then go back into the game. To load, quit your current game and change to the other file. Note that if you want your "save" to remain you'll have to copy again. It is very frustrating.\n\nI noticed the issue when I accidentally slept in the bed 2 nights in-a-row in episode 2 and therefore did nothing those days. There was no confirmation that I actually wanted to sleep, and there was no way to go back and undo the action. The autosave made it so that I couldn't just load back to before I slept, so I had to copy the file, restart the entire episode 2, and then figure out that whole "save slots" thing I described in the previous paragraph.\n\nIf The Odd Gentlemen fix this issue and allow us to actually save and load games, my review would go from about 3 stars to 4 stars (3.5 stars to 4.5 stars for King's Quest series fans).","February 2","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even with the original creators blessing i was skeptical, but to my surprise Odd Gentleman not only hit the mark but really pinned down what King's Quest did for me back in the 90's: atmosphere and story. Yes a lot of people may say they lacked this back in the day due to graphical and storytelling limits for computers then, but it was the world and environment and fantasy that helped it tell the story it needed to, and the reboot here does that perfectly. Aside from a few minor gameplay glitches i experienced as well as being somewhat simpler in difficulty, this was greatly superseded by the music, characters, and overall atmosphere and artwork that really accomplished far more than i expected. Voice work, backgrounds, the world itself has been given a lot of love and it really shows as you play. If you came for the difficult, open-ended world of the original KQ games this might not quite do it for you, but if you are looking for a game that delivers a calm and serene world and be taken into bite-sized tales woven by King Graham himself in his older years, this game delivers and more on what it has promised in the first game alone in this reviewer's experience.

Not going to lie, I always preferred the Quest For Glory series over the King's Quest series, but this is a bit different than both. This is more of a modern-adaptation to the old school point and click adventures. This is more along the lines of the Tell-Tale games that have came out over the last few years.\n\nAs of this review only Episode 1 is out. I have the season pass and I'll update it if necessary.\n\nLet's get to the sauce. The game is great looking, the voice acting is very freaking fantastic, the controls are just fine, the gameplay is exactly what it needs to be, the puzzles are not too difficult but can ocasionally leave you stumped until you figure out exactly what you need (as expected). The story-line is good, there is a couple of times towards the beginning you might feel that it's childish and a bit like a disney movie, but that feeling will fade away by the end of the first episode, I promise you.\n\nI would suggest you watch some game-play footage if you are still uncertain of this purchase. I purchased it at full price because I knew I was going to enjoy it regardless of it's similarities to the older games or not.\n\nThe biggest flaw in this game that I can see right now is that there is no way to skip dialogue. Ocasionally you will want to talk to the same person a couple of times about the same topic (the dialogue has multiple different lines which are VERY FUNNY). Once you reach their last segment they will start repeating themselves, and sometimes that can be like 30 seconds+ of dialogue. It's very annoying. I hope the developers implement a way to skip dialogue you've already listened to.\n\n\nTLDR: 9/10. -1 Point for not having a way to skip dialogue/scenes you've already seen.\n\nThanks for reading and I can't wait for the next episodes!","August 13, 2015","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think that needs to be said because those who enjoyed the old Kings Quest games seem to feel that this game was lacking.  I'm not one of those people.  I loved this game.  It made me laugh with its silly puns,it made me feel with its story,and it kept me challenge with typical point and click style adventure game puzzles without the pointing and the clicking.  There are some who will say this felt like a Telltale game.  And I'm ok with that.  It did feel like a Telltale game.  And saying that puts it in amazing company.  There was only one instance of an audio glitch but it wasnt game breaking.  The cutscenes werent too many that I felt the need to scream at the screen "get on with it!"  even when needing to replay a section.  The first episode definitely left me wanting more.  It wasnt so challenging that I wanted to throw the game down in disgust, but it wasnt so simple that I felt like this wasnt a game that an adult could enjoy.   Was the humor childish?  Yes!  And that's not a horrible thing.  I dont like games that are full of highbrow humor.  I like Sierra style humor that has dirty jokes and silly puns.  Will I replay the first chapter?  Definitely.  I played the Compassionate route.  I'd like to see the story from an Intelligent or Strong route.   I was very frightened of purchasing this game due to its cost, considering how often Telltale games go on sale, especially without looking at a review first.  But I'm very glad I dove in to the season pass.  I'm looking very forward to the other chapters and replaying this fun game again and again.","August 15, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've played the original games in the 1980s and early 90s, and now this.  I love the way the story is going so far, the voice acting is wonderful, and the game is beautiful.  I love the action sequences.  I really enjoy how it breaks up the adventuring, but I feel the controls could be better.  I'm playing on a fast PC with an XBOX One controller.  When jumping from rock to rock during the dragon fire sequence, it felt like a struggle, especially when trying to go on a diagonal.  While the game is beautful --  and I understand how it's meant to look like a cartoon, the game does nothing to push modern graphics hardware.  My GTX 770 barely heats up.  I doubt this game would even challenge older consoles.   There could be more movement in the backgrounds which almost seem static at times.  While there are some particles floating around in some screens, there could be more... a lot more detail everywhere.  This is especially noticiable after just getting done playing the 2013 reboot of Tombraider.  I know, different game, different design, but I was expecting more.  I would love for the player to be able to control the camera so we could see more of these beautiful scenes in every direction.   King's Quest IV has always been my favorite.  One of the things that made IV so great, was the music (as heard on the Roland MT-32).  Composer William Goldstein really hit it out of the park with that soundtrack.  So much so, that 27 years later, the melodies are still stuck in my head.  The music is very well done in this new game, but I feel it lacks melodies that would really make it a hit.  Overall, wonderful game, but was expecting just a bit more in the graphics and music department from a title that previously set the course for computer gaming more than 30 years ago.","August 4, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was a fan of the originals up to KQ6 and was highly skeptical when I heard that a new Kings Quest was released. So many franchises I love have gone down the drain with terrible sequels. However, I can't recommend this one enough!\n\nPros:\nGreat story and characters\nAwesome voice actors\nFantastic writing\nLaugh out loud comedy\nMedium Difficulty Puzzles (a positive for me)\nBeautiful Visuals while not looking overly 3D or losing the storybook quality of the originals\nMostly true to the lore of the originals in a creative new way\nFinally a good game that isn't a tired mindless FPS, Diablo clone, strategy game, ect. The adventure genre needs to make a comeback. Story and characters in most games are either an after thought or non existant usually now.\n\nCons:\nPeople in look of terribly difficult puzzles will not be satisfied\nYou can tell the controls were designed for console\nVery limited graphics options\nSaved games don't upload to Steam Cloud\nI have to wait for the next chapter to be released and I'm ready for it now! lol\n\nOther:\nThe main departure from the originals is the inclusion of action sequences that are usually timing or response based. Initially I thought these would make the game worse but after playing through it I think they add to the experience. They aren't really hard and it's a nice change up from the slower pace of the puzzle solving. I think it adds to the atmosphere of the world too. I mean what kind of fantasy would it be if an adventurer or want to be knight didn't have to dodge some perils now and again.\n","August 4, 2015","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loved them then, i love them now. I really like Telltales' take on things with their different enterprises and Broken Age was also great. I'm super excited for the different Kickstarter projects and that people actually want them to happen.\n\nI did not really know what to expect from King's Quest. I actually didn't really play it back in the day, but in my opinion most Sierra games shared the same feeling but in different settings. So I took a chance and bought the whole season pass, in worst case it was nothing more than a minor endorsement for this ridiculed-into-oblivion-genre.\n\nSo the first surprise was that it clearly was made for controllers, not so much point and click. Luckily I own a xbox controller for the PC and can also play from on my TV via HDMI. The overall feeling is that it works best on console, which isn't so strange as most recent (if not all?) adventure games got a console release. My view is also that the console works fine for these quite slow-paced gamed. Of course I enjoy it more laying down on the couch, that's the best position for solving puzzles!\n\nI think I will skip the game details and get to the conclusion right away. This game is great! It does not feel like a remaster or something, it feels like a new fresh game. The action sequences does not make it worse, it makes it better! And as far as I understand these sequences was in the original game (probably more or less impossible :D) so why argue with that? The story is great, the characters are great, the humour is also great! While playing I sometimes thought it was a 10/10 as it felt fresh and updated in a way I had not seen before, that might be a slight exageration but I'd definitely give it 8 or 9, and I'm not even done with the first chapter!\n\nThe first game that came in mind while playing was actually not a Sierra game but Discworld, I think the graphics and general feel got me to make that connection. Otherwise it might be valid to compare it to the more recent releases, Deponia. Which is a great hommage but also stays at that, doesn't really get it's own identity, and rarely makes you smile in the way King's Quest got me smile (and actually laugh!). I also think that King's Quest makes the journey better than Broken Age manages, and I really enjoy Broken Age as well.\n\nAll these games are very dear to me and I love these remasters and remakes that's happening. My greatest dream is the REAL comeback of old adventure games! Where kids go YES MONKEY ISLAND IS TEH BEEEEZ! Haha, yes I'm old and getting older :-D\n\nSo for all of you that love this genre for the same reasons as I do, buy this, you won't be disappointed! Now we can only hope the rest of the season is as good! The rest of you who like the genre but can't get with controllers and consoles, I actually think you'll like it too, IF you can get over these bumps and not sit and scream "why isn't everything as it was in 92!!!" :-) I think this kind of game MUST be cross-platform to even survive it's not like it's Battlefield or something... One thing I'd like though is to be able to play the same game on all platforms, with one license, not one for PC, one for PS4, etc etc.\n\nHurry up and buy!","August 5, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

An array of talented actors voicing each character, such as Christopher Lloyd as and older King Graham, Josh Keaton as a younger Graham, and other notable voice talent such as Tom Kenny and Wallace Shawn. The game follows a fashion of story telling reminiscent of "The Princess Bride." In that, you control young Graham in his adventures narrated by an older Graham, who is telling his stories to his grandaughter Gwendolyn.\n\nThe only thing that may turn off seasoned King's Quest players is that the puzzles aren't as difficult as in older games, and as of the first episode, there aren't many ways to die. However, there is still a lot of fairly good humor in the game to make up for it. Maybe not burst out laughing kind of funny, but the kind of humor that'll give you a good grin or smile.","August 5, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Boy am I glad I picked this game up.\n\nFrom the moment the elder King Graham starts making his puns he set the tone of the game; adventerous with bits of comedy here and there. This game isn't quite a point and click adventure, since you actually control Graham with the WASD or control stick, but the basics of the game would fall into that category. Find an object, find an object for previous object to interact with, gain new items or a new path, and repeat. There are a few "action sequences" peppered in, but for the most part you'll be exploring the environment looking for ways to advance.\n\nThis game is heavily story driven, and the actions you make subtly affect the way the game plays out. For example, will you leave a tip for a store, or just take the item out? While the game may be light gameplay-wise, it makes up for it with an enjoyable cast of characters, from the horribly inept Knights of Daventry to the traveling Merchant who cherishes his  pet "unicorns".\n\nStill, this game is more for the problem solver and, as mentioned before, the majority of the game will be spent traveling between many points. In other words, this is a slower paced game than others. If you're expecting to go into this game swords drawn, you'll be sorely disappointed. If, however, you're looking for a game that'll tug at your heart strings a little, this will be worth the check.\n\nAt the moment of this review, there is only one chapter out, with the other four to be released later. You can buy them 1 chapter at a time, as a whole season pass, or buy the complete collection, which is the same as the season pass but with a playable epilogue.\n\nOverall I'd highly recommend this game. Sure the gameplay is very slow-paced compared to other games, but it more than makes up for it with the clever puzzles and the witty dialogue. If you're looking for a good story, this game is for you.","November 1, 2015","true","61.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It isn't too long, but I think it is worth the $10 asking price. I haven't played the other king's quest games, but I have seen a playthrough of the 6th game and I could say that this is very much in the same spirit as that game, albiet with a lot of differences. It reminds me of another series by seirra that I enjoy: Quest for Glory. It doesn't have all the RPG stuff of that series, but it is pretty simple, yet not as single tracked as some Kings Quests from what I am told. This game has a variety of paths you can take and different orders for each, I really felt like I was writting my own story with my own choices that actually affect the world. It is a vast improvement over the Walking Dead series in my opinion as the choices you make a much more profound. Not to mention the visuals which are outstanding. From what I have heard, many of the textures in the game are hand painted and you can really tell at parts. The water and fire in this game look gorgeous and it really adds a sort of Don Bleuth vibe to it, so it is in some ways similar to Space Ace or Dragon's Lair. There are some flaws with the game of course. Not everything works perfectly and it isn't always obvious what you can and can't interact with, but it is a good game overall. I would give it a 9/10 if I had to score it, it's enjoyable and fun and has a strong replay factor as the choices you make really do alter a significant amount of the game from what I've noticed.","September 27, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are some who will say this felt like a Telltale game.  And I'm ok with that.  It did feel like a Telltale game.  And saying that puts it in amazing company.  There was only one instance of an audio glitch but it wasnt game breaking.  The cutscenes werent too many that I felt the need to scream at the screen "get on with it!"  even when needing to replay a section.  The first episode definitely left me wanting more.  It wasnt so challenging that I wanted to throw the game down in disgust, but it wasnt so simple that I felt like this wasnt a game that an adult could enjoy.   Was the humor childish?  Yes!  And that's not a horrible thing.  I dont like games that are full of highbrow humor.  I like Sierra style humor that has dirty jokes and silly puns.  Will I replay the first chapter?  Definitely.  I played the Compassionate route.  I'd like to see the story from an Intelligent or Strong route.   I was very frightened of purchasing this game due to its cost, considering how often Telltale games go on sale, especially without looking at a review first.  But I'm very glad I dove in to the season pass.  I'm looking very forward to the other chapters and replaying this fun game again and again.","August 15, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a bit short, around 2-3 hours of play if you're going for the achievements and you're used to the puzzle style of these games, but it's worth the price for sure. I played with a gamepad which was the recommended method on some forums and it played quite well for me, QTEs and all.\n\nI went through it twice and made different choices each time.

The traditional "hand, eye, dialog, item" control of the old point and click was a tried and true mechanic. I don't see any reason to deviate from the old formula.

If you want to go back you need to delete and start from the beginning. No need for such stupidity when it even has multiple save slots!\n2) Make sure you get the Complete Edition else you don't get the Epilogue. Another stupid designer choice. Are they allergic to money? Should be two ways to buy the game. Chapter by chapter or complete. Season pass without Epilogue shouldn't even be an option. Just leads to people buying it by accident and being very angry when they can't see a whole end chapter.\n3) Desperately needs a way to click past conversations you've heard many many times over. Even if it just mutes the voices. I hear chapter 2 had this fixed but still chapter 1 players must suffer. :(\n\nOverall from what I've played I still enjoyed it.

The graphics are beautiful and the soundtrack is really enjoyable (am pretty certain I recognized the KQ5 theme in there somewhere which was a pleasant surprise ;) ). The only critism I have is the lack of an in-game map of some sort. It was a little frustrating having to remember where all the locations were but that's just a minor gripe.

I enjoyed the first chapter so much that I ended up playing it three different times to see the consequences of various decisions you can make. It's perhaps a little slow for the completionist, but I thought it was amusing enough to make it worth sitting through again. Very good musical work in this too, lots of little orchestral moments that synchronize perfectly with your actions. I had a great time with chapter 1, looking forward to the rest.","February 15","true","29.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Some other adventure games have way too much dialogue, this never bores you by overdoing talking parts).\n\nI love the humor. Graham is a very spirited & animated fella. He reminds me of Guybrush Threepwood.\n\nSpeaking of Guybrush Threepwood - this whole game has an air of Monkey Island. From the humor, character movements, images & overall design. If you love Monkey Island, you will LOVE this.\n\nFor all you naysayers (I read other comments about a boring linear plot) - hang on - keep playing past the dragon part. (approx 15 minutes of playtime). Once you try to enter the tournament, the game really opens up with a huge map & lots of possibilites within a dynamic storyline.\n\nI think it's so charming, beuatifully desinged with elegance like the original series.

King's Quest: A Knight to Remember is an Adventure game with Action, Puzzle, and Moral choice elements.\n\nThe Puzzles are happily varried and are far more straight forward that the traditional King's Quest games, and probably for the better.  You won't be hurting any brain cells figuring them out, but at the same time they are satisfying and enjoyable.  There are also a variety of other puzzle types throughout the game each with their own charms, and well integrated into the games nerrative.\n\nThe Action sequences are an Exciting change of form from the previous games.  Senarios such as braving a dragon's lair feel far more epic when you are firing arrows and dodging death traps than in previous incarnations.\n\nThe Moral Choice elements are probably the weakest point of this game, but they are still quite good.  Basicallly how you choose to act in the story will leave a strong impression on your Granddaughter.  Your three options are something like Courage, Wit, and Compassion.  All treated as positive traits, and the result being purely superficial, they are mostly harmless and don't detract from the game, but I hope there wasn't too much dev time spent on them.\n\nOverall I highly recommend for people looking for a fun, and enjoyable adventure game, especially if you are a fan of the series.","January 24","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not just nostalgia for me, I play them at least once a year and have yet to get sick of them. The brilliance of the series can get lost on new gamers, they are an absolute work of art and a game that I have yet to find a match to in modern games. They were visually stunning for their time, the story lines were so thought out and engaging and the game play was magnificent. In saying that lets get to the review on this game.\n\nI think the Odd Gentlemen did an amazing job on this, they kept the old way of game play, finding random things in random places that can solve random puzzles on the other side of the map. I loved how at points I was actually confused on what to do next and spent half an hour wondering aimlessly around (Happily, as the artwork is stunning), it wasn't feed to me, I had to figure it out on my own. Something modern day games lack, intelligence and thought to get to the next part of the game. The characters were lovable and memorable (I really felt for poor Acorn and despised Manny), and the actors were fantastic. The game ran smoothly and I only had one small glitch that quickly fixed itself.\n\nI did have one problem with it, the ability to skip dialog, but it seams they have fixed it in chapter 2. Shows the devs are listening to us. I did miss the ability to move my mouse around the map to look at things, but the ability to move your character to the object does seam more logical.\n\nIn all I give this a 9/10, as nothing compares to KQ6... ;)\n\nP.S.

If you want to "save" a game, you have to quit it (and have it revert to the last time it autosaved), copy the file to one of the other 3 save slots, and then go back into the game. To load, quit your current game and change to the other file. Note that if you want your "save" to remain you'll have to copy again. It is very frustrating.\n\nI noticed the issue when I accidentally slept in the bed 2 nights in-a-row in episode 2 and therefore did nothing those days. There was no confirmation that I actually wanted to sleep, and there was no way to go back and undo the action. The autosave made it so that I couldn't just load back to before I slept, so I had to copy the file, restart the entire episode 2, and then figure out that whole "save slots" thing I described in the previous paragraph.\n\nIf The Odd Gentlemen fix this issue and allow us to actually save and load games, my review would go from about 3 stars to 4 stars (3.5 stars to 4.5 stars for King's Quest series fans).","February 2","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I imagine you get a lot more out of it if you actually enjoyed or remember playing the old KQ games. The worst part about the game is that in the first episode you cannot skip through the cutscenes, but this has been corrected in the second episode. They will probably continue this episodic improvement so keep that in mind as you play through. I don't understand the negative reviews about not being able to get the epilogue, as most of the content hasn't even been released. It is unclear at this point what the epilogue even is. It could simply be a deluxe edition type video, and it will most likely end up being released with some kind of stand alone package if enough people whine about it.","February 11","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is lots of puzzles solved by having the right item in your inventory, but fortunately the game is more forgiving and less obtuse and punishing than the original games were.\n\nIf you are familiar with the original games, or are at all familiar with Telltale's series of point and click adventure games (The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among us, Back to the Future: The Game, etc.), then you will enjoy this game, as it is ultimately a hybrid of the original series with elements used from Telltale's recent ventures into the genre.","April 16","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Is it worth going back to Daventry?  Hell yes, it is.  This game does have it's problems, but it brings back adventure games in a different form but an equally enchanting vibe.  The story is both funny and often times somber, showing the growth of our great hero, King Graham ans his journey from boy to knight.  It uses inventory puzzles like it's predecessors, but also uses third person controls to make it feel like you are more in control of Graham, along with a few light actions sequences.\n\nOverall, I found the characters to be charming and the world bright, vibrant, and colorful.  The inventory puzzles are clever and true to adventure games past, you can complete the game without all the secrets, but you can also do one better and help everyone.  You can also win a duel using a custard pie.  Because Kings Quest.  The game oozes charm and a unique fairy tale vibe, with some nice musical throwbacks to the original game and an all star cast, featuring Christopher Lloyd and Josh Keaton as King Graham in his old and young personas respectively.  Great stuff.\n\nOn the negative side, the game can be a bit slow pacing wise, as you look for the items you need to solve the next inventory puzzle and it can be a bit annoying backtracking all over the place.  The climax is also a bit underwhelming, as it lacks tension, even if it is really fun and funny to playthrough.  They go through the climax of the game pretty early on, unfortunately.\n\nThat aside, is the game worth the price?  Certainly, I'd say.  Each episode is worth a playthrough as they give a decent amount of time, but episode 1 is a great re-introduction for old fans or a good start for new fans as well.  Good times.  I'm proud to say, Kings Quest is back and is awesome.","January 3","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are many things about this game that I like, ranging from the downright silly antics of Graham to the heroic sacrifice of Achankar in the story.

Very low "active" gameplay, only a few platforming areas, it's mostly walking around and finding items and trading them for other items in the world.  It's great..\n\n3 recommendations I have are:\n-Add a "RUN" button.  There is a "WALK" button (shift) for no reason, at least in chapter 1. Running would be more valuable...\n-Make it more clear which path is being chosen during choices (bravery, compassion, wisdom).  I mean you can usually figure it out but sometimes its hard.  Especially with the bread wheel?  Why would the bread wheel be compassionate? Or go one step further and have it show your path completion in your "TAB" inventory screen?\n-Manual save game option.

I have only played Kings Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow (back on windows 95 I think...?) and it was much more challenging, more of a teen/adult game. Also Gwens voice is like nails on a chalk board...another reason I may not purchase the next chapter.\n\nThe backgrounds are very nice, but I sometimes don't care for the camera angles, especially when you are running away from things, the camera has trouble keeping up and you can't see where you are going.\n\nOverall I like this game for its thoughtless / casual playabality -- ie, when I get home from work and am so drained I want to play something relaxing that takes very little effort.

Before I review chapter 3 I want to give credit 2 chapter 1 mostly and a little to chapter 2. Chapter one was rich and full of beautiful landscapes and scenarios and good questing content. I thought it was a brilliant rendition of Kings Quest and was true to the genre. Part 2 was also good and had a lot of intelligent questing challenges. But part 3 is just terrible. There's barely any gameplay . It's mostly sequences acting that are long and drawn-out and mostly repetitive and largely annoying. The characters are annoying. The game itself is also annoying with very trite challenges that are either brief and annoying or simple jumping from Stone to Stone and really not the kind of gameplay that someone older than 10 years old would really enjoy. But some of the challenges are too complex for a young child to solve, so it’s a weird juxtaposition. So in conclusion Chapter one is great Chapter 2 is good and Chapter 3 is horrible. I even think the graphic work on Chapter 3 is bad too. It's as if all the creative juices were squeezed dry into chapter 1 and 2.","April 28","true","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Beautiful graphics, hilariously bad puns, and some really great story. I haven't played any other Sierra games, but this brand definitely seems unique. I almost never buy games-and NEVER at full price-but after playing the free Chapter One download, I'm about to purchase the season pass! Just this first chapter took me about 6 hours to finish, and I certainly haven't explored every hidden nook, achievement, and hidden joke in this game.\n\nI recognized a lot of the voice actors from games like Skyrim, and even prominent stars like Christopher Lloyd, Tom Kenney, and Wallace Shaw played some big parts in this first chapter! The one complaint that another reviewer had (that the game is mostly cutscenes, with little interaction) only applies to the first twenty minutes of introduction, I think. After that, it becomes a cool, chose-your-own-adventure logic sort of game, where your choices affect the story somewhat, which I love! This game definitely has a high replay value, and a rather unique, self-aware story, playing upon typical genre tropes.","May 25","true","28.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
