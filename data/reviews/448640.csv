The new characters still have the same quirkiness that the previous ones had. There are the same town names but the world map has changed over the period. There are some quests to be done and many places to explore. The enemies are visible which is a great help. An added help is the enemies encyclopedia which helps to identify them. One great advantage in the game, is the ability to chose difficulty  level during the actual game not just at the beginning and this proves quite useful in some areas. The party ball has been updated and now looks like a disco scene with all the colourful lights- maybe not to everyones taste as it is somewhat difficult to see the members in it. The options screen has plenty to choose from eg battle advantages, continuous auto battle and enemy guage to name a few. Another feature is the attributes system which can alter the game play.Also the game uses a day/night system as well as days of the week which poses a unique game play in achieving quests etc.\nEven though this game is still in production at this stage, it is proving to be another great game from this developer with a lot of thought and artwork put into it. Would highly recommend it  especially if you enjoyed the first one.","April 11","true","23.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

From what was presented so far, it looks like this game is shaping up to be an awesome game like its predecesor.\n\nStory: 10/10\nThe story presented so far is very intriguing and well written.  The characters are unique and interact each other very well.  The story so far is flowing well and is not dragging which Elements I tend to do at times.  In addition, the game is doing a great job in keeping the mystery of why our current foes are after Vril.  I am looking for the remainder of the story as it seems like it will be as good or better than Elements I story.\n\nMusic: 10/10\nI am enjoying the music.  I especially love the overworld theme and the boss battle theme.  The music flows very well with the scenes and battles.  The mostly guitar style of the Elements saga has grown on me and I hope in the future there will be a DLC for the soundtrack.\n\nGameplay: 10/10\nElements II did a complete face lift on the gameplay.  The most notable difference is that your actions in the game affect how your character grows.  Want to run away from an ememy? Be careful because this will cause your negative attributes (cowardice to be exact) to raise and your positive attributes to fall.  Like looting for treasure in private homes.  Once again be careful because these actions will effect positive and negative attributes.  This system makes the game more emersive and provides the game a lot of replay value as you can do different runs (e.g., pacifist run).  While the battle system is mostly the same as Elements I, Elements II do provide new features such as combos attack amongst characters.  Overall, I enjoyed the gameplay from Elements II so far and I am looking forward to any other surprises as the game progresses forward\n\nIn conclusion, I would highly recommend this game especially if you enjoyed the first Elements game.  I look forward to the next installment in this saga.","April 23","true","9.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bechstein/recommended/448640/","Bechstein","Bechstein","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bechstein/","296 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAn RPG with a sense of humor, an expansive world which shifts dramatically depending on the time and day (in-game), complex stats and abilities, and a story I'd like to delve into more one day. The custom music, exhaustive amount of dialogue, events and variables used to make almost every action have an effect almost everywhere suggest there will be a lot of replay value... or at least a lot of exploartion as encouraged by NPCs in the starting town Circlet. The beautiful original acoustic guitar soundtrack give the whole game the feel of some folk hero or ballad. Even the MSPaint cutscenes are pleasant to look at. It's a little plain and crude, but an impressive feat considering RPG Maker's low resolution. To Jeremy Zinik, his dad and the publisher New Reality Games, I thank you for putting so much effort and passion into this project.","April 1","true","5.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","1"
