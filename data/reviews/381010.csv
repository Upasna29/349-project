In fact, in my opinion it was a little too short. Appropriate for the length of a standard EVN perhaps, but you wish that it took a bit more time to flesh out the world of Orion.\n\nSo, the good thing is that the bones are all there. All the main nodes that should be there are there, and the logic as far as I can see it is sound.\n\nUnfortunately even a beautiful skeleton is just that, and the various flaws I want to point out still stems from the problem that there isn't enough content to flesh out Orion. To start with, Orion is a world of Unionism but you barely get a sense of it from complains mouthed by various characters. The main character is a naive kid who is shielded from this reality, but even then he should've seen some acts that are considered 'abnormal' in our society in his daily life. We don't get that. During the whole adventure, since you're constantly on the move there's no time to appreciate the world. All we get are verbal woes from characters we barely scratch the surface.\n\nIn fact the only character you'll feel familiar with is Virgil. Everyone else, even your own bro Louca feels terribly distant, and while you can feel his (almost disturbing) love for the MC it... could've been more elaborated. I wonder how many people will feel tricked by the Mari CG. She totally isn't important at all in the story and could've been replaced by a faceless goon for all I care. Really, I enjoy the game quite a bit, but I must repeat again and again that there just isn't enough flesh or time to make these seemingly cool characters endearing or even memorable.\n\nI guess that's the tradeoff for having full voice acting in the game. This is quite high quality stuff, but can be seen hollow in the inside.","September 28, 2015","true","1.7"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","35","38","0","0"

Ultimately, I enjoyed the plot threads, the music, and the character designs. However, a lot of the nine different endings were basically unsatisfying with a lot of different plot threads dropped. For the first eight endings, this is fairly deliberate as the premise of the game basically forces you to try different scenarios and keep playing to finally put most of the pieces together. And I use the word "most" in that last sentence on purpose: the ninth "true" ending is basically the ending that reveals the most information in terms of build-up but kind of the worst ending for all of the dangling plot threads and character development in the game.\n\nWhich would really be my biggest complaint, I think, with the game. All the characters except for Sam and MAYBE Virgil are basically stock figures that don't get much life of their own, motivations given to the characters are weak or nonexistent, and the game spends far too much time going "WELP BYE!" to characters other than Sam and forgetting that they exist at all. Finally, I had a lot of high hopes for the political intrigue and worldbuilding that were mentioned in the Kickstarter campaign only to find that there's really only the barest nod to both.\n\nIn the end, I don't think I wasted my investment on the Kickstarter campaign, nor was I bored during the two hours I was working out all nine endings. I even hope Reuben Lack and his team put together another VN in the future -- I just hope the do it with deeper development in the world and characters.","October 3, 2015","true","2.3"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","27","28","0","0"

This information has been entrusted to him alone. With the identity of the messenger itself obscured, Sam must decide whether the risks of investigation are worth it. What could a single person do to stop the inevitable?\nTo learn the answers behind this message, Sam must confront forces at the very core of society.

Except that it doesn't work that way, because some of the time the final decision didn't do anything when I reloaded the save and replayed it, and some of the time I get a message that says something along the lines of "something's not right" and I get a non-ending that is not listed in the endings collection. Since I have wandered down all 4 of these plot branches by now where the other choices give miniscule variances from the plot, it's now all about experimenting and skipping a lot to get the sequences just right, or following a walk-through, or reconsidering whether I really need to complete this game. And given that it's failed to touch me in any way, I gave up at this point.\n\nSo what's the take-away? The characters are one-dimensional, their "dialogue heads" and their appearance in the main art panels differs in style and sometimes also in detail (e.g. eye color), there are voiceovers for the dialogues but not for the narration that are good but fail to provide the emotional depth that the writing lacks.\n\nI've seen better.","December 13, 2015","false","2.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","2"

The setting and characters in Orion feel underdeveloped; when characters go from friends to enemies or vice versa, it doesn't have the emotional impact it should, because the reader barely knew the characters in the first place.\n\nThe choice structure is interesting, with an in-story justification for the choices and multiple endings. But there are a few occasions where if you don't have the right flags to reach a particular ending, instead of hiding the unchoosable option, the game just ignores your choice without any feedback. Took me a little while to realize this was a deliberate design choice, because it feels like a bug.\n\nThe true ending, which takes about two hours to reach (Steam didn't record my play time correctly), might have felt like a satisfying conclusion if I had a better sense of the relationship between the characters -- a better reason to care about them -- but instead it's is just anticlimactic.\n\nThe voice acting is quite good, and I love the CG art (although it clashes badly with the more cartoonish character sprites). But overall Orion is dull and unmemorable.

The story telling and concepts the game portrays are very interesting and pulled me in immidietaly. I almost instantly fell in love with many of the characters, and although that may depend on the person, I picked a few favorites very quickly that I found to love through out the whole entire VN\n\nIn addition to the fantastic story-telling this VN has many different paths in which may lead to a "bad end" or a "good ending" and you need certain specific ones to get the "True Ending" Which makes the game a ton of fun, I always found myself thinking about which choice I was going to make over and over again, knowing that my decisions do have an impact on the game.\n\nFor those who beleive the game isn't that long or they felt as if the ending wasn't complete, that is because it wasn't. It was not the True ending and they most likely picked the wrong choices which in my opinion is one of the best parts about a Visual Novel. Trying to trust your own self in order to see how your own actions reflect in a game is one of the most rewarding feelings even if it is the "bad" choice.\n\nFurthermore, the sound design in this game is very nice, which made reading this visual novel even better, I found myself enjoying the music more than I realized because it fit the mood so well of what I was reading. The art is also amazing, and really portrays the game very nicely. This is a Full-voiced game which is incredible since all of the voice actor is done very well. I never found a voice that I thought was annoying unless the character was, in fact, suppose to be annoying. Basically, the voices fit all the characters really well and it was done very nicely. You will fall in love with the voices, sounds, and art of this Visual Novel.\n\nOver all, I believe that this VN deserves more credit than it has recieved, and if you enjoy reading visual novels in your spare time, you'll fall in love with this one. :3","September 30, 2015","true","42.1"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","12","18","0","0"

I've had multiple "choices" to make so far in the game, however many of them appear to be completely inconsequential. Stuff like "stay here" vs "make a run for it." Except the "make a run for it" option has you recaptured a second after, and there doesn't seem to be any indication that it has any impact on the story that "stay here' wouldn't have had.\n\nIn chapter 3 I ran into two choices, both that led to really vague game overs. Speaking of which, the game overs I've been getting have been very oddly written. It seems like the game expects me to be discovering these endings on replay, because they don't make very much sense. Almost as if I were stumbling into the end or middle of a game's story without any context. Like in one ending I successfully meet a character I needed to meet. Then the game ends with "Was this the right one?" "No. But I can't say why. Sorry."\n\nIt is too early to really render a final verdict, but my initial impression isn't as good as I was hoping.

The choices can feel minuscule or like a guessing game, and only when some of the rather abrupt endings appear before you do you realize you must've made a mistake.\n\nThere is a meta-plot of sorts. The game isn't too obvious about this and I only realized it halfway through. You can time-travel (although for many parts the protagonist is unable or unwilling to do so) and having to see multiple "wrong" endings is actually part of the idea of rewinding time. As soon as I stopped regarding being tossed back to the main menu screen as mere "Game Overs" I was able to relate better to things and understand some initially irritating comments made by the protagonist or by his constant tablet A.I. companion "Virgil".\n\nAs goes with time-travel, I guess, the story can sometimes feel messy, even if it isn't complicated at core. The meta-plot idea isn't always carried all the way, and you may regard to people already differently than the protagonist does when doing your second branch, leading to a disparity in how either of you is perceiving things, even if by meta-logic he should be just as aware of everything. But I suppose there is a limit to how far this meta-thing can be carried in time-travel fiction and expecting everything to respond deeper is probably too much to be expected and nitpicking.\n\nEven so the logic within seems profound. The dev appears to know his stuff as things seemed plausible to me once explained by the protagonist or Virgil. At times I had wanted to yell at the protagonist to use his powers to get away from dire situations but he is just a kid and it's being mentioned often enough that his ability might take a great toll on his body or surrounding. The endings - even if abrupt - feel plausible, some of them being more sadder or scarier or positive than others and being faithful to the sci-fi nature of it. The "true" ending is a little more extensive, and felt "true" enough to me, having finished the game with an ultimately good feeling even if I probably haven't understood all the details.\n\nThe meta-thing can feel awkward. What in theory could be an interesting time-jumping thing has you "just" reload saves and skip your way through other dialogue options or actions, essentially performing a guessing game in the hopes to find those specific routes to the endings you're still missing. There are 8 "untrue" endings and you need to see them all before being able to go the path to the "true" one, which strongly relates to the meta-perception of the protagonist and Virgil - without having seen untrue endings the true one wouldn't make sense. I tried going the true path earlier and oddly the game makes you time-jump back to the decisive dialogue again and again with no explanation why you just hopped back a minute in time. If you haven't realized by then how this all works you'll probably feel irritated. Some other paths felt buggy instead, choosing either out of two options would lead to the same end unless I had made specific different choices earlier on. I got that far only with a walkthrough from the dev. I'm not sure if I had been able to get all the endings without it, I can well imagine one could get frustrated without. Luckily the skipping works very fast and there are plenty of save slots, otherwise I would've never had the patience.\n\nThe game is overall nicely designed. Menus and stuff look clean and polished (it better be, being a sci-fi/dystopian game), there is some pretty nice music and good voice acting for dialogues that only in a few instances touch the fence of turning cheesy. The art can be great too although the character portraits have a different style/artist than how they are designed in the backgrounds (I've read in another review details like eye colors sometimes differ between either, I haven't noticed any such disparity). There are a couple typos but I don't think I've ever seen a VN/gamebook without those. A few times the voice acting and subtitles aren't aligning 100% but it's no great deal.\n\nI wish some characters would get more time to explain themselves. The game is rather quick in pushing events forward, like it or hate it. Across the various timelines and story branches you get to assemble more or less of a detailed picture of some of them but a game that has time-travel in it could've probably given you more options to examine characters and the world if it had tried hard enough. There are some political ideas tossed in but for many parts it's more glimpses than anything. The protagonist's whining annoyed me a little at times; he is pushed from one situation to another neither knowing what to do nor who to trust, but once I went with his frustration about the whole thing I was able to relate to him and his fears and doubts. Characters-wise it's him and his sort-of-bickering with Virgil that shines the most, which is no surprise because they are the only two constants across the time- and plotlines and they make a good duo.","March 10","true","12.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

The problems, however, are definitely felt - from minute ones like differences in the CG art and sprites being so drastic that it detracts from the immersion, to the frustrating requirements for the final ending (I had spent a fair two hours finding the base 8 endings, only to get stuck with one of them that just wouldn't come up no matter what I did - only to find out I was making mistakes at the very beginning with choices supposedly inconsequential to the later action) - but are mostly seen to (they've recently taken to posting an Ending Guide since the True Ending is very likely to be missed, had people not had the patience to go through all the choices to discover the base 8 themselves  - something very, very likely as with my experience).\n\nNonetheless, the atmosphere is nice, it's a charming piece if a tad slow at points, and there are some good points to it.\n\nMy final recommendation would be to get the game if you like Sci-Fi stories that center around time-loops - going back again and again until you get things right - and maybe when the game's on a sale. I dont think the game's bad, but I've also seen better. Nonetheless, the game still has merits hence the recommendation.\n\nP.S.

Updated this a bit.\n\nThe game is short if you're a Skip Jockey. If you're a "do a route now and then" kinda gamer like me, I think the length is fine.I take my time reading VNs so be warned it will likely be shorter for you.\n\nConsidering the cost of a movie ticket, I think the price is fine. Voice, art, music, writing and sound effects cost money and this is well done.\n\nThis is a visual novel, not a point and click or sim. Look it up if you haven't "played" one before.\nThis is sci-fi not otome. I can only read so much fluff before needing something to chew on.\n\nIts a VN with 9 endings with several choices along the routes. I'm noticing there are main branches and others just give bits of flavor text. Some routes are definitely more detailed and its not intuitive to get to some of the parts that divulge major character backgrounds. The flow of the choices and what you get from making them are the only area I can pinpoint for mixed feelings, that not intuitive, not quite satisfying at times part. Not sure if its a "when you do a route amongst the others" mechanism that starts bringing things more into alignment or that I just stumbled on vague for the first two before getting more into it.\n\nI won't talk about the storyline or plot, as going through it is the most fun of these VNs and I'd hate to lose an "Oh!" in the midst of playing to a review without enjoying the set-up within the VN, especially with a short VN.\n\nVoice acting, sound and music give a premium feel that really go the extra step for immersion. Its a tough choice between Cyrus and Louca being my favorite characters. Voice, writing and character are just such a good mix, but it took a bit to get there. Still, "NO! Keep eating." had myself and most of the folks in the room chuckling. Voice acting isn't over the top, good tone for the characters and were nice for the feel of the game. Really glad to see more of the VAs from other VNs I've enjoyed.\n\nArt was split with sprites being more cartoon art (which I happen to like as a nice change around all the anime style I also enjoy). CGs have a much more graphic novel feel (what I read when not in VNs) with a good use of color and lighting to add to drama / feel. The backgrounds felt more a mix of the two styles. They had a good level of detail and some added to the feel in a more cinematic way than just showing a kitchen, bedroom, theater. i.e. characters interacting in the background making speeches or crowds of people shoving around. Would have asked for more of those. Kudos to the background artist for playing in both styles and working to bridge some of the disconnect that using such opposite styles in a single game can cause.\n\nWriting... I have to go through more routes. Not like I need it to discuss, but I WANT to go through more routes, which tells me its good. They're tackling 2 tough things in this story: 1. Time travel and all the trip-ups, intricacies and just literary physics you have to keep track of for plausibility. 2. The only voice really telling the story is a 16 year old clueless boy, who's purposefully been kept in the dark about everything his entire life, and is describing things in the first person. In the telephone game, this means you as the reader are even more clueless.  It manages to be intriguing and frustrating simultaneously which I guess is part of that immersion thing again.  I'm assuming this isn't the writer's first VN or if it is, I admire your "go bold or go home" self. Nothing like skipping the bunny hill and going straight for the black diamonds.\n\nI'm off to learn more of the story. I know there's a lot hidden and I hope the majority makes it into the light through Sam's eyes.\n\nI may update this review if things change, but I'd say it comes in next to "Octave Higher" for me which means some good depth of work, world creation and concept and in the upper ranks of VNs I've tried, especially for indie.","April 7","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There was a lot of potential in the plot, but there was no follow through.  There are 9 endings, but even the "true" ending is anticlimactic.  It is a short VN (2-3 hours), which probably did not help much.\nIf the game is in [another] bundle, go for it.  Otherwise, I would pass.","February 15","false","4.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's not easy to tell who the good and bad guys are.   The plot choices are extremely bland and trope.   Unfortunately the story is poorly told which means there is no real intensive to replay the game for all the endings.   The 1st ending I found was unsatisfying and confusing.   The other endings were not any better.   It's a shame as the graphics and sound in the game are above average for a visual novel.","December 9, 2015","false","1.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And the credit song blew me away. Honest to God, I teared up. Ironically, I got all of the bad endings first, but every new ending gave me a little piece of the puzzle, and a little more about the characters I interacted with. Sam Acacius is an amazing young kid with a really good outlook on life; despite all of the crap thrown at him, he keeps a level head, and doesn't cave, staying true to himself the entire journey. I will admit, I had my doubts, mostly when I kept getting the bad endings, wondering if it was worth it, but holy hell, was it ever! My favorite character was Virgil, his sass made me laugh out loud so many times. Truth be told, I'm normally more of a fantasy gal than a sci-fi gal, but the trailer piqued my interest, and I don't regret buying it in the end. Great story, solid characters, beautiful art, and the way Sam handled the difficult moral choices thrown at him made me question my own moral structure (just a bit). VERY highly recommend this game, to anyone even remotely interested.","February 22","true","5.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While the story is a little rushed, the routes seem to be quite different enough to make it worth it. I'm charmed by both art styles - that of the sprites and the more realistic CGs, though the huge leap in style takes a little getting used to.\n\nOut of all the VNs on Steam, this one is worth giving a shot!

True ending is rather disappointing. VA work is fine but sounds aloof at times. Characters become irritatingly stale after a while. Art's got its charm.

Really can't recommend it at its full price though.","December 19, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
