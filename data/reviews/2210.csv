And how fast it flew off of them. Very long, but it is worth it. I personally like games that give a long story line. I feel alot more involved, than a short campaign.

I got to say I was super surprised of how much I liked playing through this game. I thought this was going to be a lot like DOOM 3, but Quake IV is different. A lot different in my opinion. The single player storyline has a sort of high-tech sci-fi feel to it. The environment is very exciting and unique.  I also liked the squad-based combat. Playing through Quake IV was highly enjoyable and would definetely recommend to play this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/2210/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Quake 4 is yet another linear old-school'ish FPS in a Quake franchise. A franchise where no previous games were connected to each other, think of Final Fantasy. Quake 4 is proud exclusion, being a direct sequel to Quake 2, where space marines battle against cyborgs made of steel and human flesh on their planet. It was developed by Raven Software in 2005. And uses Doom 3 engine, so beware of sharp dynamic shadows.\nThere also was Collector Edition which came with Quake 2. As you expect, Steam version is not one. And there also was X360 port, that had Quake 2, some achievements and a bad optimisation. Not missing much there.\n\nSo, as for technical side. You will notice that textures are low quality even on Ultra Setting. That's because engine doesn't recognise mordern hardware for what it is and thinks you have very little memory and refuses to put correct settings in. You have to edit config files for textures. I recommend you to take a look at Steam community guides, there is a good one that tells you what commands to change.\nI also would still have some small glitches with lights/shadows after playing for a while, but very minor and rarely, unlike what I had in Doom 3.\nAnother thing is that it had an awful lot of stuttering, especially when opening door to a new room. As if it tries to load something but for some reason has a lot of problems.\nWhile game has options for widescreen aspect ratios, not all widescreen resolutions are there. Edit config for those too.\nNo alt-tab in fullscreen and no Steam Overlay.\n\nAs for multiplayer community, it's tiny. There are only few people, I only got to play in 3-player deathmatch. But in all honesty, since Multiplayer is similar to Quake 3 Arena one, it can be quite enough. You know, game where people tend to duel.\nApparently a lot of servers use Q4Max mod. It's low size anyway, and only seems to add more server options for competetive scenes, like full-bright skins, while not changing core gameplay itself, so it's OK. And some fixes. And gamemodes.\n\nAnd in this plot you play as Kane, a silent protagonist and a badass who already got famous for things we don't get to do in this game. You are part of Rhino squad with who you will spend some of game time too, occasionally.\n\nThe Earth launched a second invansion on Strogg planet, hoping to fully clean it up while they are in supposed chaos as the certain badass killed their leader in Quake 2 (and another badass destroyed base on asteroid and another sissy blew up Gravity Well). Sure thing it was about as effective as assassination of political leaders, especially when we are talking about polished army of machines with purpose to kill, so you are about to get some more of hot time.\nBut at least this time 99% of marines weren't immeditly killed.\nNot to mentioned that this time you will have some small cutscenes, radio chatters and NPCs to give the world more of living feel and to move a storyline. While still mostly focused on action and gameplay.\n\nAnd yes, while it's not mazes, rather being what you would call a corridor shooter, it still can be considered old-school action. While having badass graphics. Frankly it didn't try to be spooky or dark like Doom 3, instead deliviring some shooting and aciton that Doom 3 didn't. And if you measure quality of FPS by how effective shotgun feels, then buy it immeditly, because shotgun in this makes ragdolls hoversault and just blows.\n\nAnd yea, it's continuation of Quake 2, so you will see some familar elements from that game. But I feel that this one realized them much better. Which wasn't hard, seeing how Quake 2 felt unimpressive and somewhat generic even for a year of it's release. I mean, what tech advantages of Q2 would matter if you can't see anything past color red of art style. Anyway, Quake 4 isn't red, it actually has a art style that can show you dark grotesque images of creepy meat factories while staying colorful. Everything was slightly redesigned to be more badass too.\n\nGameplay also can be counted as superior. This one seems to pull weapons from Quake 3 arsenal though, with lighting gun and such. Well, with blaster instead of gaunlet. Don't worry, they are balanced around each other for single-player, having need to reload and special abilities of some. Monsters aren't as lame either. Melee berserkers can actually chase you down instead of never being able to hit a walking player. Monsters aren't as hitscan based either, having plenty projectiles to shoot and tactics to employ, making it more varied and fun too.\n\nIt's just shame that I can't say that it's music is better than Quake 2 soundtrack. I mean, main menu theme is nice and such and very Quake-like. But during actual gameplay you will be only occasionally hearing some kind of orchestra of sorts. Something from generic non-interesting heroic movies soundtracks. It still pumps you up during game, so it works.\n\nAnd most awesomely, Raven Software took a few lessons from then-modern games and used them to improve pacing, variety and overall enjoyment of this linear campaign.\n\nThat includes masterful mix of rest moments and high-action ones. Sometimes you shoot many baddies, other times you are crawling over conveyer belts. To that extend it also employes parts where you are stuck on a turret of venichle or have to actually control one and get to another point. Thankfully, those sections are simple to control, aren't hard, short and fill quota on explosions, so they are most welcome.\n\nAnother thing that it takes are teammates. No longer you have to travel in Strogg world all alone, while failing to get immersed because you don't belive that every marine would become insane just from managing to land onto planet. I am referencing to Quake 2 again, yep. Sometimes in some sections of a game you will be followed by one or even up to three of marines, who will help you to effectively clear out the rooms, while rarely getting under your crosshair. They also don't suck, don't die easily and can kill stuff. And just make it feel more alive and that you are part of team. And some can heal and give armor. Don't worry, there is enough of lone wolf action, like one-man-army you are.\n\nIt also keeps on changing in player abilities, and not only by giving you weapons. It even updates the existing ones, giving them new propereties. Like turning nailgun (yes!) into scary weapon with projectiles that follow target. Or giving lighting gun ability to spread on others nearby. Thus also making you thing of how to balance your weapon choice and usage through the game. Even if railgun and lighting gun feel underwhelming.\nIt also even once updates your character, diving game into slower-paced half and into more of solo faster-paced one. Well, I am mostly talking of character speed. Let's not spoil the cutscene.\n\nAnd yes, it has a few bosses. Not many, most are put together in the end of a game. But still some and they are nice, even if final boss feels a bit dissapointing. Maybe. Those are actually quite good last encounters, just can't help the feeling. I also should mention that last levels were actually surprisingly hard, died a few times.\n\nNow, multiplayer part. It's Quake 3 copy! Why I never heard much of cheers and why didn't it replace Quake 3?\n\nWell, not sure, some people mention something about netcode or about "doesn't feel as good for some reason" or such. Though the more reasons that I can understand is that levels use single-player textures and assets in more dull way, making boring-looking levels, though with sleek feel. And same goes for weapons look.\n\nOtherwise multiplayer seemed to be improved, from my non-pro look. Like, it added some cool crouch-sliding from Quake 2, there are two new weapons. It feels sleek to me. Projectiles can go through teleports and grenades bounce off jumping pads.\n\nStill a blast.\n\nCertanly, best id title in a sense that it has 'both' good singleplayer and good multiplayer.","October 25, 2015","true","9.7"," 65 of 74 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","65","74","3","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/QG632/recommended/2210/","QG632","Sir Quake, Esquire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/QG632/","137 products in account","This game is absolutely amazing. I remember once trying it out when I was younger and I never really made it very far into the game. But then my friend gave me this as a gift because like me he likes Quake and I thought 'well why not lets give it a go' and that was one of the greatest decisions of my life. the singleplayer campaign gave me around 8 hours of gameplay and it was spectacular.\n\nthe game has fantastic atmosphere and goes from badass shooter to tactical shooter to ♥♥♥♥ scary 'oh sweet jesus may god have mercy on my soul' in a matter of minutes. the game is fairly difficult to be honest, enemies do quite a bit of damage even on Corporal, which I assume is the 'normal' difficulty but it's never too hard only requiring you take your time and don't rush in guns blazing hoping things die. The guns are absolutely lovely and each enemy seems to have a gun that works best to kill them, some flat out requiring you smash them with the local superweapon which may at first sound like a pain in the ♥♥♥ but it really isn't, it's just the simplest way to take them down without using all of your ammo and I never found myself using the superweapon that often until the final level where I used the aforementioned 'rush in guns blazing and hope people die' strategy and it seemed to be the best way to go with little cover and all the strongest enemies trying to absolutely destroy you. One 'issue' I had though is that there never seemed to be more than a few enemies attacking you at any given time, wether this was an issue with ID tech 4 (the game engine) or wether this was just a design choice made by the developers to help with the fact that enemies do quite a lot of damage and you need to sit back and take your time and if you didn't constantly fire and risk getting shot right in the face then you would quickly be overrun.\n\nall in all the dark setting, kickass weaponry and all round 'creepy' atmosphere (which makes sense, this is war time and your forces seem to be very heavily outnumbered by the Strogg) really work well to keep you very interested in the game and I never fealt myself getting bored and wanting to play something else. The story is pretty interesting (or I thought so atleast) and the characters aren't all that bad themselves though they do come off as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s most of the time by making you walk off on your own to fend for yourself in this horrific setting with monsters potentially around every corner wanting to rip your face off but it made getting back to them so that you aren't dealing with the horrors alone all the more relieving and you never really go too long without someone there to watch your back which some may see as an annoyance that takes away from the dark and scary atmosphere but I don't really like that all too much and I'd much rather have that in bursts and still have someone there to keep me company so I don't go completely insane from time to time.\n\nso all things considered this is a truely great game and I would more than recommend you buy this, I would recommend you get some friends to as well (I found a co op mod and haven't tested it myself but have high hopes). the game is fun, story is enjoyable and I found myself connecting with the character and found myself putting myself in their shoes which is a great thing for games to do and I don't get often. though I do wish that I could have more than two weapons with torches on them while it does add to the creepiness as they are the two weakest weapons in the game (well the lightning gun is pretty bad but atleast it looks cool).\n\nGameplay - 10/10\nStory - 9/10\nBadassery - 11/10 (gun that basically shoots black holes!)\n\nOverall - 10/10\n\nOh and don't even bother with the multiplayer, I do like that it is VERY heavily based on Quake 3 and if you liked Quake 3 as much as me you will probably like the little bit of nostalgia offered by it but that's about it.","June 30, 2014","true","8.2"," 47 of 52 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","47","52","0","2"

Instead it feels much more linear, slower paced, and steel corridor-based just like Doom 3. While the gameplay might not be worth writing home about, the enemies are pretty awesomely designed and there are some great sound effects, music and visuals that help make the game's "alien warfare" atmosphere stand out really well. And there are some occasional vehicle sections that usually take place in wide open areas.\n\nAlthough I generally think Raven Software did a better job with Wolfenstein 2009's gameplay (despite it being very COD-esque), it's still pretty fun shooting aliens in the face with the famous Quake weaponry making a much appreciated return appearance, not to mention there's also one particularly very memorable sequence, which I won't talk about here.\n\nOverall, worth playing if you enjoy shooting gruesome monstrosities in the face in a gritty sci-fi environment (like I do), but don't expect TOO much from the gameplay if you enjoyed the older Quake titles.","February 13, 2014","true","10.6"," 43 of 52 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","43","52","3","0"

You are Corporal Kane, and here brings you this mission: drive the strogg, your enemy, back to hell!\n\nI first got this game in 2006 (not on steam), after my dad showed me the quake series with him. I thought the game was truly one of the top-dogs back then, the storyline was actually very well detailed, combat seemed smooth, and difficulty seemed well played (despite that those spider enemies make me want to kill myself half the time). The weaponry you are given seems very well flexible, the machinegun wasn't very useless, the shotgun didn't seem useless, and balancing your ammo with every gun seems very thorough. Quake 4 also has multiplayer (but noone really plays that anymore).\n\nThe few boss encounters in this game seemed very difficult at first, but after a while, it isn't really that bad, considering a few  enemies late in the game have the same complexity as one or two bosses. The ways to kill every boss seemed interesting (noticing every boss in the game has a health bar, so I think there is 3 or 4? There may be more, but those are enemies you'll never see a lot as you walk around on the battlefield) and the final boss was the most interesting, along with the story that went with it.\n\nYet, I could see a little improvement, since I'm told there might be a new Quake (there is a new Doom coming out), I did see some slight errors with the game. The game's AI that are on your side seem to be a little wonky at times, sometimes they'll be overpowered, sometimes they won't. The enemy AI rarely screws up, and when it does, you'll sometimes need to literally restart a checkpoint, which could get frustrating. All-in-all, I didn't see that many glitches/bugs/exploits in the game.\n\nThe level design for almost every level seem very organized, balanced, and smooth. Early in the game they don't throw that many obstacles in your path, but later in the game, they'll toss in a hefty amount of enemies, spiced up to hardcoreness. As I mentioned difficulty earlier, there are four difficulties to the game (pretty simplistic, right?), Private for the easiest level, and General for the hardest. I've only played on the mid-tier difficulties, Corporal and Lieutenent (Normal/Hard). Both of the mid-tier seem very easy to play after you've had a chance to deal with every enemy. Fighting each boss on the easier difficulties, you'll know what to do on harder difficulties (bla bla bla).\n\nIs this worth the price tag? If you really want to wait for a sale, I'd wait for a seasonal sale, or quakecon sale. It's definitly worth the twenty dollars if you're looking for a decent challenge, and a game that's somewhat old, but actually feels smooth.","August 20, 2014","true","27.7"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","33","36","0","0"

When I first started the campaign, the game's graphics were terrifyingly... bad. It seemed to have issues streaming textures in, giving the game a very washed out and comicbook-like look. This problem is a common occurance according to many Steam users but don't you worry, Sikkmod not only fixes those problems but makes the game look incredible to boot. I recommend everyone to download that mod, here's a tutorial on how to set it up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qwc1gFx4Nc\nSadly, the FPS lock of 60FPS can't be circumvented, which is a shame, and for a game with competitive multiplayer a rather questionably decision. However unlike Quake 3, the multiplayer is pretty much dead which is to be expected.\n\nThe story is set right after the events of Quake 2. The Makron has been killed by some lone Space Marine (heh!), the Strogg's defenses have been weakened and it's the perfect opportunity for the Space Marines to strike. You take on the role of Cpl. Matthew Kane, a "certified badass" for reasons unknown, shooting your way to the communication hubs with Rhino Squad to destroy them and cripple the Stroggs' communications. But things never go as planned and you get captured by none other than... the Makron? After having some "enhancements" done to you, you get rescued in time by your squad and the real fun begins...\n\nOne of the things you'll notice at first is your movement speed, which compared to earlier entries of the Quake series is quite slow. This can be circumvented with the console parameter "pm_speed x" and should be binded to a key as the game reverts your changes after loading a save or new map (bind key pm_speed x). I suggest increasing your running speed to 230, the same amount after your character gets "enhanced". FOV is good enough to begin with and can be increased further by typing in "g_fov x" in the console. Again, bind it to a key. The shooting in this game is very satisfying though I found the hit registration to be somewhat unreliable. I often found myself having trouble to kill even the weakest enemies as they seemingly absorbed most of my bullets. This only happened with the Machine Gun and Railgun however and it may as well have been my own incompetence so take this info with a grain of salt. The combat is what you would expect from a oldschool shooter: fast paced, mostly projectile based and alot more difficult than todays games. I'd consider myself fairly competent at FPS games (the genre I play the most) and Quake 4 isn't gonna go easy on you. I died quite a few times on Lieutenant Mode (Hard) and reflecting on my playthrough I can only think of 1 or maybe 2 times where the game decided to be cheap (like getting knocked into an abyss by a homing rocket). Quake 4 also has a few vehicle sections which mark the lowpoint of this game. They are just boring and cumbersome, luckily they don't last for too long.\n\nQuake 4's levels are more linear than its predecessors which may be a turn off for some people but Rave Software did a great job designing them. Stroggos is a biomechanical nightmare you don't want to experience in the flesh. One level in particular titled "Waste Processing Facility" is especially unnerving and creeped the ♥♥♥♥ out of me (a gorehound). Quake 4 does feel a bit "cinematic" and sometimes hinders your progress (Marines blocking your ways, doors not opening) but it's bearable and doesn't destroy the pacing. Kane's squadmates are a likeable bunch and some of the events in the campaign are very memorable. The music is a mixed bag, rangin from nice ambient level tracks to standard action oriented songs. The main title by Chris Vrenna is nice to listen to.\n\nQuake 4 is a damn fine game.

Ever. Quake 3: Arena by id Software - This is one example of Raven doing a damn good job at capturing the storyline and feel from Quake 2's Plot-Line against the strogg for a surprisingly original and excellent Single-Player campaign (It was praised for this on launch) - and a very very good Multiplayer that tries way too hard to be more of the same while slowing down the gameplay movement; and even slowing down how fast rockets and the rail gun fired - Overall it creates an excellent B+ MP experience that I could spend 100's of hours fragging in and be fine; but does not come near the A+ perfection that was, and is Quake 3. Raven has been asked a lot by Activision on ip's they did not create - Raven being a talented studio that has created excellent ip's in the past its the shame that id titles (Quake IV, Wolfenstein *(2009)*) began Greed-a-Vision's dominance on the company; With those two titles They had been given freedom in both Singleplayer and Multiplayer; since then they have been forced into a Formula with Modernwarfare 3's Multiplayer and forced more-so in Call of Duty: Chokes err Ghosts Multiplayer (Along with all of the motion capture and more than half of the singleplayer; with Raven (Aided by members of Neversoft) making something out of nothing with the Extinction game mode; the only positive that is in Call of Duty Ghosts; -\n\nThis stays as a landmark title that was enjoyed by just about all who played it. Wolfenstein 2009 had a semi-open world and Raven designed a super gorey fun to gib nazi's in realism style singleplayer; along with a Gun that made IGN's top 10 weapons of all time in a Video Game list; Although Wolf2009 had a very forgettable Multi-Player that saw the title with much less replayability compared to all titles prior; id's Return To Castle Wolfenstein had and still has one of the most popular multiplayer modes.. Enemy Territory; Pioneered by Splash Damage (Who then make the A+ MP GOTY Quake Wars: Enemy Territory; the Publisher Rushed "Brink" which had great potential and was fun.. - and now are taking time to perfect the F2P Competitive FPS market with Extraction *was called Dirty Bomb for majority of its existance; it's some of the most fun I've had with A+ Netcode going back to Closed Pre-Alpha; into Closed Beta right now).\n\nLet's hope Raven can spread their wings and start to innovate titles as they did in the past; and not be restricted by Activision as they are now. Go look at the games they made over the years. Somepeople may not know Raven was responsible for titles that they cherish.

I started playing it again after at least 3 years break and had forgotten what a quality game this is and after 11 hrs played so far it just gets better.\n\nNot quite finished but feel the end is near, but based on what has happened the finale will be tough and heaps of fun I have no doubt.\n\nIt is quite a while since I have experienced playing and jumping with fright from surprise attacks from small and some enormous enemies that appear to just keep on coming and which often appear from nowhere and when you least expect it!\n\nThe graphics are great and I think recently improved by updates, as I have had at least two since starting the game again and it all looks a bit better. Shadows and contrasting lighting add to an eerie feeling of impending personal destruction.

As soon as I started the game, I was immersed in my role as Kane.  A certified Bad ♥♥♥ marine.  The only odd thing about this game is that Kane never says a word, lol.  Everyone just keeps talking around him as though he was a mute, he he..  A seasoned marine, and always determined to complete his mission; Kane goes through a very painful (you better believe it!) and cruel transition at the hands of the Squids while captured.  However, that didn't  stop him from completing his mission.  As it turned out, Kane's new body was a blessing to his superiors.  Kane would be able to infiltrate the Stroggs defenses and ultimately destroy the heart of the Nexus, which controls all Stroggs and all valuable information sent to them, thereby, creating confusion.  With an arsenal of unique and powerful weapons, Kane along with the rest of the marines set out to destroy the Strogg and their never ending torture against mankind.\n\nThe graphics look great.  The voice acting is also great.  There's lot of action and of course, different modes for you to choose from.  If your choosing hard, remember to *fast save* whenever you can.  A great feature, which is a big PLUS.  I hate repeating the whole level over and over again.  Use Xpadder or other program for controller support.

The story isn't that deep but is good to explain more about the QuakeII/IV lore and the graphics are really amazing (for the time). I think this game could have been better if the campaign was more deep and long, maybe some alternative endings or paths, even the final boss is not that threatning and easy to kill, leaving a really weird and anticlimatic cinematic. I would recommend this to people who wanna try something different on the FPS genre, not the best of them but it really shows how oldschool shooters were back then when all that mattered was the fun of shooting things with overpowered guns while running like a madman.","April 28","true","7.5"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

This is a worthy sequel to Quake 2 (with some caveats).\n\nThe singleplayer campaign picks up shortly after the events of Quake 2.  The Strogg's planetary defenses have been disabled and a second invasion operation by the humans is underway.  I thoroughly enjoyed the campaign.  There's a stronger story this time around, named characters pertinent to the story, medics and techs that can heal you and provide armor recharges between fights (on occasion - and try not to let them die), and you get to fight using an assortment of heavy weapons - including a tank and a battlemech (they call it a "walker" *pff*).  A f'n battlemech!  They had me tank...  *tear* *sniff*\n\nThe graphics are very nice, running on the impressive ID Tech 4 engine introduced with Doom 3, and while there have been advancements with graphics technology in the last 10 years - they still hold up extremely well.  The architecture in the game is very detailed and the texturing very well done.  There are some large open areas on the planet's surface, but most of the game you're running around inside of the, often tight, corridors of the enemy compounds.\n\nThe sound design is solid, with ambient sound permeating and creating much of the mood for the areas you'll traverse.  And throughout you will hear radio chatter that gives you an impression of the scope, cost of the war being waged, provide you with story points, and levy objectives on you.  The sounds of weapons' fire and impact are all very good - no whimpering shotguns here.  The music is sufficient, but it lacks the unnerving moodiness of previous Quake titles.\n\nThe weapons you get all have their benefits and deficits.  For instance, some enemies will take bullet after bullet from your rifle when another is quickly turned into swiss cheese, but they all seem to be more susceptible to certain weapons over others - one enemy type in particular will explode almost immediately when hit with the lightning gun.  You start out with a pistol with infinite ammo that is actually quite useful in certain situations.  You will also gain a rifle, shotgun, hyperblaster, nailgun, grenade launcher, rocket launcher, lightning gun, and a dark-matter gun.  Throughout the singleplayer campaign you'll get little upgrades from techs in your unit that add new features to some of these weapons:  a bigger clip, increased damage, a targeting scope, etc..\n\nThe developers clearly tried to add alot of combat flavor to the game, arguably absent from the first game (a minor quibble).  There is a portion of the game where you have to man a mounted gun on a moving tram and take down enemy aircraft as well other vehicles.  In another you have control of a hover-tank and have to quickly maneuver and destroy an assortment of enemies and armament whilst trying to navigate to your objective.  In another you get to man a battlemech fighting off the enemies with it's heavy caliber guns and rockets.  Yippee ki yay mutha♥♥♥♥as!!\n\nThere are around 20 or so different enemy types, not counting bosses and all fairly disgusting, especially the zombies that puke acid (this might explain why I need pills to sleep at night).  They get similar weaponry as you, though some have unique energy weapons, flamethrowers, and whatever the hell the Iron Maiden's awful scream attack is supposed to be.\n\nQuake 4 does drift away from the feel of Quake 2 a bit too much, imo.  The Stroggs of Quake 2 lived on a planet with a thick blood red sky.  Their installations were dark, gritty and minimalistic.  The architecture was authoritarian with big red banners draped on their exteriors that reminded one immediately of the Nazis during WWII.  Their technology was function over form.  It had dangerous fauna and some truly memorable enemy types.  Exploration (which often required some puzzle-solving) was rewarded, you could swim underwater, you could throw a grenade - using it's tick-time once activated to good effect, the hyperblaster was like a gatlin gun that shot lasers and made a unique piercing sound when it was fired, you were given objective information by a computer that notified you with quirky voice, etc..\n\nMeanwhile in Quake 4....\n\n...the sky is blue and reminiscent of Earth, their installations are often well-lit and incredibly high-tech.  The architecture barely resembles that of the previous game.  There is no dangerous fauna you'll come in contact with and most of the enemy types have been completely reimagined and some are just completely missing.  The story is supposed to take place after Quake 2, but everything looks and feels just too different.  There's almost no exploration to be had and it never involves puzzle-solving, there is no water ANYWHERE and so no swimming either, you can't throw grenades, the hyperblaster here makes a sad whoomping sound and seems more like the plasma gun from Doom, and there is no computer updating your objectives.\n\nI'm sure I could think of more if I sat here long enough.  I just don't understand why Raven felt the game world needed such a makeover.  Updating the graphics using new technology - awesome!  but this level of reimagining was totally unnecessary.  The upside is that the game is just as dark thematically as Quake 2 and includes some very gruesome, gory content - arguably more disturbing than what Quake 2 was able to convey.\n\nIn the end this is an excellent game that just falls short of reaching the level of awesome of it's predecessor Quake 2.\n\n\n\n","April 7","true","18.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Sure, I got away from PC gaming for awhile and it had been a REALLY long time since I was heavy into Doom and Quake, but I felt a little funny that I didn't know this existed!  With a cheap price I figured it was a must play for nostalgia's sake at the very least. I didn't expect a whole lot out of it, which is good because it turns it's okay.  Not great, but okay.\n\nI run a couple of movie podcasts, so I watch a lot of flicks.  The state of the modern shooter in comparison to classic style shooters compares pretty well to the world of movies.  Most of the time, you like to watch a movie that's well put together, highly polished, engaging and engrossing.  This translates to your modern shooters in the game world.  Games such as Bioshock Infinite or even Deadspace are a different beast than the shooters we all cut our teeth on.  They're deep, they have branching stories, they're well put together. It's a production...an experience.\n\nJumping back to your movie world. you have another class of movie which boils down to your dumb action or horror movies, stuff put out by the likes of Syfy Channel or Asylum.  These movies are cheesy with no depth whatsoever.  They're there simply to treat you to explosions and special effects, nothing more than the spectacle.  Quake 4 fits in perfectly with this type of movie; there' s no depth to it whatsoever, it's there simply for you to run around and shoot aliens.  And that's it.\n\nMuch like watching the movies though, sometimes we simply don't feel like wrapping our head around something deep. We want to munch popcorn and watch stuff explode.  Video games are the same way, and Quake 4 is a pretty perfect fit for those moods.  It's a solid through back to the good old days where you're only concern was checkpoints and finding your way to the rail gun.  The story is a nice aside but really doesn't do anything to suck you into the game.  You're sticking around for the fun of shooting Stroggs and seeing what the weapons do.\n\nThere's some sections in Quake 4 that are annoying.  The vehicle sections are slow and clunky which makes them frustrating when you're trying to dodge.  Some of them feel like you're on a rail shooter without a whole lot to shoot at.  The game is way too long for what you're there for too.\n\nIn the end though, things blow up pretty well and it play smoothly while showing it's age.  It's worth $5 and a Sunday afternoon.\n","August 4, 2013","true","9.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","2"

The core gameplay is quite linear and baisic, but it does make up for this with some excellent shooting mechanics thanks to the briliance of the Doom 3 engine, each ounce of lead (or lighting, or dark matter, or nails, etc.) you pump into enemies feels satisfying. Couple that on top of the wide enemy variety (complete with bosses), the very diverse set of weapons you find (with upgrades too!) and ragdoll effects on enemies that never quite get old, you got yourself a very entertaining shooter at it's core.\n\nNow as for everything else:\n\nLevel design: Probably the next best thing about this game, while quite linear, it does provide a very good sense of atmosphere with the  very  ♥♥♥♥ed up things around you.

I can't say much more without spoiling it, but expect to feel uncomfortable with places that make you go "What the ♥♥♥♥ is THAT?" or "That's seriously ♥♥♥♥ed up.", and belive me, you will have a ton of those moments.\n\nSoundtrack: It's okay, nothing really special about it, the soundtrack fits the moments I guess, but you'll be too busy kicking ♥♥♥ that you'll forget what's playing in the background.\n\nStory: Also not much to say about it, you are a marine that has to kill aliens and destroy thier main base to save the earth, something happens in the middle of it but that doesn't stop you from kicking ♥♥♥ and saving the world.\nI'd also like to note that the moment around the middle of the game  will  leave you remembering it for the rest of you life.\n\nGraphics: You'd think it would look particularly bad thanks to the game being 10 years old, but with the engine it was made on, this is far from the case, while it is low in polygon count compared to newer games, it has much better lighting and particle effects then most of the games I've played, that's very good considering it's age. Look up screenshots of the game on max settings or play it yourself on max and you'll see what I mean.\n\nMisc: Voice acting is good, nothing spectacular. Game has little or no replay value due to it being linear, however there are plenty of mods that offer new campaigns and levels that should keep you going if you want more.\n\nOverall I give Quake IV a 8.5/10, it's excellent at what it does. Anybody looking for a amazing fps with it's own unique identity must check this game out, if they do not mind  the baisic and linear "kill anything that moves" style that comes with it\n\n","August 8, 2015","true","10.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","2"

Which adopted a more traditional premise to the original game's "Cthulhu inspired castles". Where you play as a Space Marine up against the borg-like Strogg.\n\nQuake 4 however does a lot to distinguish itself from Doom 3 and it's predecessor Quake 2 infact. There are NPCs for one who aid you in battle. While you are still the "One Man Army" archetype in most FPS games it does feel a lot more story driven as a result.\n\nOf course like it's predecessor Quake 2, it has a marvelous heavy metal soundtrack to compliment it's atmosphere.

Unfortunatley, it doesn't work on newer machines for most people.  This game should be taken off the store until the issues are resolved.\n\nTo start, no matter how high you put the graphics settings, they will automatically load low res textures and turn off AA.  You can fix this and many other bugs by editing the config file.  Once that is done, the game looks pretty damn good.\n\nHowever.,... if your like most people, the singleplayer will randomly crash and dump you back to the main menu for NO reason.  For me it is certain mobs that crash it, and there seems to be no way around it.  Too bad, because I grew up playing quake 1 and 2.  I was truly looking forward to playing the 4th one, and I can't...

I first got this game in 2006 when I bought a new PC.  I actually got 2 copies. I bought one on DVD, then got a CD copy when I bought my video card :P  I started the game but rage quit/bored quit as the game was slow to load and just boring.  Years later I got a copy on Steam and as part of a challenge to play my backlog, I finally finished the game this year.\n\nThis game has a bit of a slow start, and years ago the game just ran slow.  On newer computers the latter isn't as annoying allowing you to move into the more interesting parts sooner.  This game was built from the Doom3 engine but it feels like the runt of the litter in some ways.\n\nThe game doesn't really shine till the 2nd half.  I started off having to force myself to push on, but later I wanted to push on.  I wanted to see where the story was going to go, I wanted to see what the next big guns would be .. what the next massive baddies would be, and even where the story would go!  Lets be honest, this is a Quake game, people don't get into it for the story :P\n\nLater on your various weapons get some useful upgrades as well as upgrades to you making you move faster etc.  As I look back at the screenshots I took in January I see so many colourful scenes, I see a lot of gore and a lot of cool scenery waiting to be admired.\n\nThis is a game which went from thinking ..

Blast your way through the harsh architecture of a malevolent alien race with a formidable assortment of weapons, fighting against a plethora of varied monstrosities. The action is well-paced and presents a consistent challenge, keeping players alert and committed, the scarce moments of rest feel deserved and include an exorbitantly barbaric medical scene that serves as a strong narrative development. The bland vehicle levels and ardently dismal turret sections create a few chinks in the armour.\n\nQuake 4 is yet another gem in a series that shows no signs of slowing down.\n\n8/10","April 4","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

It did to the Quake series what Doom 3 did to the Doom series: modernized it to a sort of Call of Duty-ish game devoid of any personality or style that made the previous games so amazing. It is basically an early version of Doom 3. It is pretty much the exact same dark spaceship/spacestation surrounding ultra-tight corridor shooter with no heart in terms of id softwares previous games, just a above average military-esque shooter. I don't know one person who cared about this when it came out and not many people played its MP. Even today, more people still play Quake 1-3 mp than Quake 4. Quake 1 had the dark evil atmosphere that was pretty terrifying for its time and provided a hell of a challenge, Quake 2 abandoned all of that but still managed to be one of the all-time great pc games, Quake 3 did too even though it was mp only, and Quake 4 is just an outcast game that the only thing it has in common with previous Quake games is its name. Disappointing garbage for Quake fans, competent in its own right. I am passing it only because it is not a bad game by itself, even if it does ruin the Quake name. If I had to guess why Quake 5 hasn't been made yet, I would say it is because Quake 4 probably had such bad sales numbers.\n\n6/10","February 16, 2015","true","3.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","1"

The story is shady, though. It's essentially Iraq/Afghanistan War propaganda. The story is that you're part of the marines invading a desert planet fighting the locals, much like what the US was doing when this game was released. The graphics still hold up fairly well considering this game is just about a decade old. There are a lot of well realized technologically, industrially advanced locations filled to the brim with details. The setting is gritty sci-fi and the aesthetics really sold the dark atmosphere. There is a fair amount of gore in the game. The game certainly has some similarities to Doom 3, which was released around the same time. Quake 4 leans more towards sci-fi where Doom 3 more towards super natural horror. The lighting is really well done. The colorful lights from the computer screens and machines contrast well with the mostly otherwise pitch dark rooms. Think of the lighting at a rave and you've got it. When first arriving on the planet, the main character can't understand the alien writing on computers and it just looks like jibberish, but a little ways in something happens to him and then the computer consoles start displaying messages in English, like the character learned to understand the language. The main character looks like Robocop without his visor on and it looks bizarre. The combat is decent. There are a lot of corridor battles and the 'ol trusty running backwards in a circle, shooting up the enemy tactic still works a bit too well. The weapons were standard issue. There wasn't anything too exciting, but they were suitable for the game were fun to shoot. The level design is mostly simple and straight forward, but combat was never boring. The boss battles were challenging, yet not too bad. I will say, the final boss was much more difficult than I anticipated. It took me a while to figure exactly what I needed to do. There are some on rails sections and some where vehicles are controlled that break up the on foot parts that make up a bulk of the game. Frequently NPC marines will join the fight and every one of them gets a name and so I always felt bad when they'd inevitably get mowed down. It took around 10 hours to finish. Quake 4 is not the revolution that the first one was two decades ago, but it is still a fun game that holds up today.","June 8, 2015","true","10.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And about an hour was enough for me. It's really, really boring. The level design is lame, enemies encountered in the first hour are lame and mostly huge hp sponges, weapons are lame and not very satisfying to use. The game has slow as hell pace and I spent first 15 minutes wondering whether sprinting was possible (nope). You basically just walk through boring corridors at turtle's pace, encounter enemies, sidestep if they're ranged or step back if melee. Or you can just wait for a while and wait for your immortal squadmates to wipe them.

Read on to find out why.\n\nFor reference, I am playing on the PC version with a trackball. Even then, the mouse sensitivity on the highest setting is still woefully slow for the majority of combat situations you will be finding yourself in during the course of this game. I hope your mousing hand has had training from Usain Bolt, because you'll need every ounce of arm speed you can muster.\n\nWhat on earth is a reload mechanic doing in a Quake game? Considering the Quake games (used to) focus more on mobility and feeling like a badass even when the odds were not in your favour, having to hide and reload (or worse, having to reload in the middle of a heated firefight) really destroys the pacing of the combat. The mechanic itself is not a bad one, but it is handled poorly in this game. You get the sense that it wasn't planned into the fabric of the game very well at all. It is infuriatingly slow to reload and a lot of the time, as stated before, you find yourself in the middle of a fierce battle having to reload. Now, often this isn't a problem when you are with other members of your squad, but if you are in a solo battle, you have very little chance to survive. Indeed, I find that if the PC game did not have a quick save/load feature, this game would not be recommendable in the slightest. (I wouldn't dare try playing this game on a console under any circumstances.) The only way you can have a hope of surviving (and even then, it is a slim chance) is by mashing the reload key/button after every battle, no matter how big or small, because if you don't have full clips for all weapons before you turn the next corner, you will be toast, more often than not. I have found that the way to get around the slow reloads is to make sure you have a full reload in all weapons and simply switching weapons instead, because switching weapons is much faster than reloading.\n\nSpeaking about slow, your run speed in this game is slower than Quake 1's walk speed! Trying to run away from enemies is useless. Just pump ammo into them until you run out, then give up, die and restart. You will have to play through the previous 10 minutes of gameplay again.\n\nAlso, this game is entirely too hard. As stated in the intro, I was playing on the Private difficulty level, which is the easiest of the four difficulty levels, and I cannot count the number of times I have found myself surrounded by enemies with an empty clip in my gun or less than 20 health. I had to quick load some parts of this game up to 20 times just to try and see if I could quickly kill a guy behind me (whom I couldn't hear because of radio chatter from my squad) while I was on under 10 health. This is immensely frustrating, and is essentially the reason why I could not be bothered to finish the game. If I am having such difficulty with the easiest setting, what use is there playing a harder difficulty?\n\nThere are some really good aspects to this game though. The atmosphere of war at the beginning of the game, and being able to work with your squad in the more typical war-battle based segments was great. It really captured the sense of battling an enemy much more powerful than you, but still giving you the feeling that you had a chance against them. (That feeling didn't last longer than 30 minutes, though. You get quickly overpowered by the enemies.) Your squad also help you when you have to hide and reload. (When you are allowed to fight with them, of course.)\n\nMultiplayer is basically a copy of Quake 3. Owing to my single player experience in this game, I didn't try multiplayer, because I have Quake 3 and would rather play that instead. Quake 3 is even a better single-player game anyway, even with its lack of a story or campaign.\n\nIn summary, Quake 4 is to Quake what Doom 3 was to Doom. It could have been a decent game… only if it was thought through much better, and wasn't called Quake. Associating this game with Quake's rich heritage and therefore, having fans of the series remember and try to apply the play style and tactics of the earlier Quake games, has done more harm than good to this game.\n\nIf you like sci-fi war FPS games and have no knowledge of the Quake series, this might be an enjoyable experience for you. Pick it up for £5 or less if you want to give it a go. It isn't worth more than that in my opinion. However, if you have any experience of the previous Quake games (and I have been playing Quake since it came out in the late 90s), I would steer clear of this game. Despite the title, it's not Quake.","January 26","false","12.9"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

I've had a great time playing this shooter but only after installing some mods. Let me put this straight - this game is not properly optimised for Steam. I have a good graphics and enough RAM to run most games but this Quake 4 game even when put in Ultra Quality settings has crappy textures. Add an overall gray-brown-black-metal surrounding and your graphics may look like well, mud.\n\nI have most of the same gripes with this game as I've had with Serious Sam 2 - the vanilla game didn't age well. Graphics are not optimised for High Definition, the main character is moving pretty slow for a cyborg, some encounters seems heavily scripted, weapons sometimes don't pack as much punch as they should.\n\nBut after installing SIKK MOD and PARALAX MOD the game just got better. Graphics are finally nice - dynamic lights, most of objects are retextured to some HD textures, we get some blur effects, etc.. But we also get some problems with levels loading and game crashing after modding so this is a mixed bag of goodies and uglies.\n\nLet's try to sum up all of pros and cons for Quake 4\n\nPros:\n- modded graphics look really pretty\n- enemies are grotesque, mechanical monsters with solid design\n- sound is fine\n- plot is ok for a single player mode\n- weapons have nice design - Nailgun and BFG both look nice and have a considerable power\n- sometimes we can control vehicle like tank or mech suit\n\nCons:\n- although vehicles are fun, those levels with vehicles are pretty long and boring\n- some of weapons are underpowered - I think that grenade launcher, rocket launcher and most of all railgun are somewhat weak\n- graphics without mods\n- most weapons have clips that you need to reload every now and then - really, who thought that would be a good idea in a Quake game? For example Railgun has a 3 ammo in a clip. Most stronger enemies take 3-5 hits with a railgun. Same goes for shotgun - we need to reload it slug after slug up to the point where we get a magazine upgrade and then we can reload a whole magazine (about half of the game). Luckily, we can remove clips with a SIKK mod\n- character moves really slow and enemies move fast. That can escalate rather quick... - we can change that with SIKK mod\n- no replay value - single player campaign is scripted and multiplayer is possibly dead\n- buggy as hell when modded - I needed to move config files manually every now and then when some levels didn't load. It was pretty annoying to save game just before next loading screen, then exit to desktop, move files, run game, load saved game, pass through a loading screen into a next level, save game, exit to desktop, move back those files, run game, load saved game and finally play it. Really, this is pain when you need to do this about 20 times during whole game.\n\nAfter all I can recommend playing this game after modding it a bit (if you can grab it for let's say 5 bucks/euros that is) but if you're not a Quake fan then you can skip it. It's definitely not worth 20 euros, it aged poorly and looks bad without mods. I've had fun but I would not play this game a second time. It's barely playable without mods and thus I can't give thumbs up to a game that requires mods to be fun.\n\n----------\nFor anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/","May 3","false","8.6"," 6 of 29 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","6","29","0","2"

I wasn't expecting much out of it, even though Quake 2 is one of my favorite games of all time (but for its multiplayer, not its singleplayer). Plus the reviews of the 360 version of Quake 4 were pretty bad.\n\nEven though it was indeed a bad port, I really liked the game. It was a good shooter with a nice weapon upgrade mechanic   and a sweet story twist around the halfway point of the game. But now, in 2014, I'm afraid that it just hasn't aged well. I played Doom 3 before trying my hand again at Quake 4 PC, and Doom has aged much better. Quake 4's graphics look good from a technical standpoint, they don't have the crazy intense atmosphere of Doom 3 but they also don't have Doom's muddy textures. However from an artistic standpoint they're just...flat. Everything feels very generic, very "been there done that." The shooting feels like a relic from another era, your weapons feel powerful but you need a ton of bullets to take down your enemies and there's a lot of them, so in firefights all you do is shoot at everything that moves until they drop.  No real tactics here, just shooting. What made those 90's shooters so satisfying is the crazy amount of stopping power you had at your disposal. The double barreled shotgun in Doom 2 can take out a whole room of low level minions if aimed correctly. THAT'S satisfying. Needing 5 shotgun shells to down one guy while his two or three buddies use you for target practice? Meh.\n\nSo, yeah, leave this one in the past.","June 19, 2014","false","2.5"," 4 of 28 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","4","28","0","2"

Gone are the days of being a lone marine who is humankind's last hope of salvaging the invasion of Stroggos, you now have squad members with you at all times and a commander talking in your ear telling you where to go and what to do. The levels are far more linear than in Quake II. Ammo and health is abundant and enemies are only remotely a challenge on the highest difficulty, and even then they're pretty easily beaten (except for bezerkers, seriously ♥♥♥♥ those guys). The persistence of the Quake ammo/health + armor system and the classic weapons/enemies are really the only things keeping this game from falling into the generic military shooter family of games.

This had the feel of Doom 3 with how it moved and played. The multiplayer aspect of it was disappointing because there weren't too many people playing online but it was still active.

Doom pushed the line on what games were ok to do by adding severed heads or random sums of gore. Wolfenstein pushed the lines of racisim. Quake the original one pushed reality,for back in the day anyways. Quake 4 continues the story of Quake 2 from way back in the day and even explains what happened(if you pay attention) and throws a TON of new curves in. The war against the Strogg is far from over but with their tech in the hands of humans their might be a way to win. Tanks,turrets and tons of guns + modifications given by friendly NPC and one major upgrade given by the enemies makes the game fun. The story is gripping and REALLY well told, more than worth the money. It can be pretty difficult and although it has it's bugs it was also one of the top shooters of it's time. The enemeis were creepy, the landscapes and facilities unique and the weapons a blast to play with.

Thumbs up considering it's age.  Has multiplayer available, and surprisingly enough, ppl are still running servers for it.  Have always liked the Quake series as it has always been the building block of today's shooter games","August 10, 2012","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The steam version has some problems with later graphics cards.  I don't have the time to research how to fix it, but it should be a cautionary decision for those out there since this is an older game.\n\ntl;dr list\n\nPros:\n\n-Hard Mode: This game is unforgiving on higher difficulty settings, wave after wave of enemies coming for you.\n-Weapons: Some games have your standard assortment, this game felt better in terms of their sound, texture, and such.\n-Combat: Simple Strafe and duck mechanics, culminating to glorious combat.  Vehicle combat is ok, but the meat is regular combat.\n\nCons:\n\n-Older game: It's not super flashy, and it might not work on some of the newer gen cards out there or run into issues.\n-Hard Mode: While hardmode makes it great, things are jaded where it's the standard "increase damage to make it harder."\n-Cheap Shots: There are some cheapshot enemies, but this is a minimal negative.\n\nI would say get this game on discount vs full price because of the graphics issue.","December 25, 2014","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Setting is nice (and like I mentioned earlier, a lot more of the lights are working compared to DOOM!!!) You get to use mechs and tanks; for me, these are the more difficult parts for me (I'm more for traditional fps, not vehicle combat). Some levels can be difficult at times, you get to a save point or have to quick save to save yourself from having to replay a longer section of the game over again, but now maybe your stuck with less ammo and health to take on a challenge. In these situations, you just have to play that challenge slowly and methodically, practice, make your shots counts (memorize the AI behaviors, anticipate them). Unless you've royally screwed yourself, then you may need to restart.\n\nIf you liked DOOM, you'll like this. It's basically a lighter (literally) sci-fi alternative to DOOM. DOOM was dark and demonic and it worked well for that. This is more fighting disgusting aliens (& becoming one, an ugly duckling for sure) in a slightly more military themed environment, still heavy on sci-fi, though, and I like that. No health regen, just health paks. No ADS/iron sights (can we have another quake that has this, please?). This is more of a run (dogde vs. cover) and gun like the traditional/older FPS games.","January 27","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Quake 2 is horribly generic even with good gunplay, a decent sound track and ideas that theoretically good make for a good story had it not been forsaken. I have yet to play Quake 3, not much of a multiplayer type of guy. That brings us to Quake 4, and having played it it cements a belief i have that Raven Software - taking over development from id software - is a grossly underrated Developer. Quake 4 demonstrates that their games ability to be really fun and in somes cases bringing something neat to the table - for this game in particular, they bring a cutscene that David Cronenberg could've directed. The Game as i said is quite fun, a nice variety of guns all effective and fairly fun to use, enemies to use them on, and a few surpsrisingly fun vehicle sections - except that first turret section jesus christ. the game feels like the baby of Doom 3 with its enviroments, graphics and gameplay and Call of Duty due to the strong presence of your NPC space marine companions.  The game feels railroady a bit early on and the NPC's stole all most of the kills  but you lose them at certain and thankfully lengthy sections later and the action picks up considerably. The story picks up all the missed opurtunities Quake 2 dropped and it feels a lot more interesting because of it, certain sections even gave me chills with how well done they were. All in all i give it a recomendation.","February 25","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Released more than ten years ago, it still manages to hold a special place in my heart for its interesting, old-school mechanics and its interesting attempts to wrap up the "storyline" that began in Quake II.\n\nBy no means does that mean you need to play Quake II to play this one, as Quake 4 does a very good job of giving you an overview of what happened previously before you're shoved into the perspective of a Corporal Matthew Kane, a man that everyone seems to know of for some reason. Earth is finally taking the fight to the homeworld of the Strogg, a grotesque group of biological/mechanical hybrids who seem to design every aspect of their planet for maximum defensive and warlike means.\n\nGameplay is a combination of what one would expect in an old-school corridor shooter and what one would expect from a squad-based fps. For some reason, however, they abandon much of the squad-based nature of the game about a third of the way through the game. After a major plot point, the player character is seperated from most of his fellow marines, and remains mostly seperated from them for the rest of the game. This is also the same time that many of the more powerful enemies are introduced.\n\nThe game's pace is very inconsistent for the middle part of the game, as I expect the developers were struggling to adapt to the new style and designed levels that wound've worked a bit better with the squad-based system. These transition levels were always less fun for me than the rest of the game, as they seemed to rely on the difficulty inherent in fighting large enemies in enclosed spaces.\n\nHowever, the game really holds up despite all of this. I personally love the game's art style and the voice acting is top notch. I haven't played the multiplayer in years, so I can't vouch for how well it has held up, but I remember it playing like a much faster Quake III.\n\nIf what I've discussed above appeals to you, why not pick this one up?
