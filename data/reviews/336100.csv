As a base game you know you're buying it because it has the Rooster Teeth name on it because they're an epic group of people. As a game though, it is lackluster and should have stayed as a mobile game.\n\nIn the first hour of play I noticed the following things that stopped me from playing it again:\n\n-Characters attack automatically. This seems like a good thing at first but when my character was firing a shotgun at long range and wasting bullets I kind of have a problem with it. The auto-attack also made my character shoot walls if the zombiens were turning around a corner.\n\n-I bought this game for the Rooster Teeth part of the game. It is pretty awesome in that regard but much like any RTS, every single movement click makes the character say something. With limited voice acting clips for movement this gets annoying pretty quickly. I love Gavin, but I don't want him to say "Oh you found some gubs?" one more time.\n\n-Waves start automatically when you kill the last enemy, not allowing you to check for weapons, move around the map, or set up defenses properly. A "Next Wave" button would be greatly appreciated.\n\n-The game ends when your starting character dies instead of when the last of your party dies when you find other RT members. This is probably intended but I would have preferred if you lost when the entire group was finished, not just your main character.\n\n-Other bugs like getting stuck in the floor and I can't maximize the game because it's a mobile port so clicking messes up. The lack of settings is also pretty annoying. No fullscreen or resolution options to fix this so I'm playing on a tiny window. I may as well have bought it on my tablet instead.\n\n-Camera moving sensitivity is... very sensitive. This is minor but it's something you do a LOT in a game so it's important, and there's no settings to turn it down.\n\n5 dollars isn't a lot of money so I don't think it was that much of a waste but I would have enjoyed this much more of some of these issues were addressed. I would probably buy the game on my tablet instead and see if it's any better as an actual mobile game but I sadly don't want to spend any more money on this game.\n\nI'd rather put the money towards another Rooster Teeth shirt to match my other three.\n\n\n\nIn summary, I do not recommend this game. The port isn't that good, even if you buy this game just for the Rooster Teeth portion of the game like I did. The game needs work. Maybe the game isn't as bad on mobile, which it was originally made for. If you want to buy this game, buy it on your large Iphone, Samsung, or a tablet to play on instead.\n\n","January 2, 2015","false","1.0"," 58 of 79 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","58","79","2","0"

The voice acting is quite good, and the game has a nice flow to it.\n\nI know this is a port of the mobile version, however I still feel the controls are not up to par. As soon as things start to get hectic, it becomes incredibly frustrating to work. The fact you have to de-select your party to unlock a door, buy an item, or pick-up loot is something that becomes taxing, and most of the time you forget to do it because you're so focused on trying to stay alive. Scrolling also needs a sensitivity option I reckon, given I find it zooms right across the map on a tap of a key. Having said that, there is a lot of potential here and I am sure Team Chaos will update and fix issues the game has in due course. Not a bad start.","December 19, 2014","true","0.8"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","17","28","3","0"

The touch controls of the original mobile game have been translated to mouse clicks, but that is pretty much all the optimization and changes that were made. There is a lack of very basic PC options such as resolution, AA, or even the option to run it in fullscreen mode. If you try to run it in fullscreen, the button presses don't always work properly. On top of that, even though there is a low and high graphics setting, the two options do not look much different from each other. On top of that, there was no improvement in the overall look of the game from the mobile version. The only complaint outside of the technical shortcomings is that there is not a way to regenerate or purchase health unless you pick up rare health drops. I am a huge fan of Rooster Teeth and what they do, but I feel that this port of their mobile game is one of the weakest I've seen on Steam.","July 3, 2015","false","0.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RLYoshi/recommended/336100/","RLYoshi","RLYoshi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RLYoshi/","175 products in account","It’s a little disappointing. Unless all RTS games have these as basic rules, Zombiens is rather poorly made. Let me give you a rundown of the game before I get into the problems.\n\nThe plot revolves around a spaceship crashing into the Rooster Teeth office and release zombie aliens that the protagonist dubs “Zombiens”. You go around the Rooster Teeth office, collecting weapons and materials to survive various waves, being helped by Rooster Teeth employees you come across. In order to find them, you must use money to unlock doors to different parts of the office.\n\nHowever, here is problem #1: their locations are not only randomly generated, but impossible to discover until you’ve spent over a hundred dollars on a door, only to find healing items inside. Finding an employee to help you is an invaluable asset, and practically required before the third wave unless you either A) use guns (which I’ll get to in a second), or B) get super lucky and find enough healing items to recover from the damages of the first two waves. Believe me, if you don’t have full health or a ranged weapon, the Plague Carriers will demolish you - they deal bleeding damage and have high defenses, so this early in the game, even a full-health character may have trouble.\n\nProblem #2: the weapons are distributed through vending machines. They also cost money, and are also randomly generated - not the locations, but which vending machine has which item. Not a problem, right? But some vending machines are inside those locked rooms. I have, many times, started with a primary gun-user, only for the immediately available vending machines to have swords or bats. I unlock the Achievement Hunter office, find a shotgun vending machine, have no money to buy one, and promptly headdesk while the Plague Carriers devour my delicious fleshy form.\n\nProblem #3: the game has problems involving clicking. If you click on a barricade to start destroying it, your character will walk over to a designated spot around the barricade to attack it. Said designated spot will often require your character to walk away from the barricade directly in front of him, down the hall, around several rooms, and to the other side of the barricade before you attack it. I am not kidding.\n\nFurthermore, the game seems to register enemy clicks poorly; if you aren’t exact with your click, your character will just move to that spot and stand there for a second before attacking the enemy automatically. (I’m glad they implemented the auto-attack, though. No downsides to that whatsoever, unless for some reason you don’t want to waste your weapon’s durability.)\n\nProblem #4: of course, glitches. The most infuriating is that, sometimes, your character won’t pick up health items. Unlike the usual way of picking up items (by holding down the click button to draw all items in), you have to walk your character on top of the healing item to use it. And sometimes it will not realize your guy is standing on top of a pizza trying to eat it. This can easily screw you over, if you’re making a quick retreat for healing before going back into the fray.\n\nThere are more glitches, too. When you try to buy something from a vending machine, it sometimes won’t work for some reason. I have, once again, been screwed because it wouldn’t let me buy a pistol I needed. So even when you do find the randomly generated weapon that you desperately need, there’s a chance you won’t get it anyway, regardless of money.\n\nProblem #5, and the biggest one: there is no way to check the strengths or weaknesses of a character in game. Once you find Gavin in the Achievement Hunter office or Barbara in Support or whatever, what will you give them? You’ll probably have them buy the closest thing, like a saw or a bat, because you can’t check what they’re good with unless you exit the game/die, go to the main menu, and look through your character stats. You just have to guess, and then even better, somehow remember the stats of specific characters when you find them again - stats that make no sense. (Gavin is amazing with firearms in the game. In real life, he really isn’t, and nobody will ever see the logic in giving him one.)\n\nThis game needs work. It’s a great concept and I love the design of the office, but… seriously, unless these “problems” are RTS staples (in which case I will never play another RTS), this game needs a V2 that fixes so, so much.","February 4, 2015","false","1.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

This game is terrible. Bought it because I'm a huge RT fan. This is the ♥♥♥♥♥iest port ever, made by scumbag developers.\n\nPros:\n\n-It's a Rooster Teeth games.\n\nCons:\n\n-No option for fullscreen\n-When you maximize the window, the controls get disabled\n-Difficulty curve is ridiculous and the enemies are ridiculously OP (I could beat wave 3)\n-Weapons are randomly assigned to the vending machine and so if the weapon in the closest vending machine is trash, you're basically doomed\n\nAnd this was after only playing for about 15 minutes.\n\nOh, and about the scumbag developer part. They promised an update 4 months ago (which came out months ago on mobile) and it still hasn't come out. Oh, and they blamed it on Steam taking awhile to process it. I'm no Steam expert but I seriously doubt it takes 4 months for Steam to process an update.\n\nAdding even more fuel to the fire, the dev either completely ignore people who point out these flaws or make fun of them.\n\nThis conversation shows them completely ignoring me pointing out issues with the game.\n\nThis one shows them essentially laughing off a bug that someone pointed out to them.\n\nThat it so unprofessional. I regret buying this game. Oh and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s don't even offer refunds, either. Nice. They lie through their ♥♥♥♥ing teeth and then won't even offer me a refund. Doesn't really matter for Steam anyway because Steam doesn't offer refunds, either, but still, it's the principle of it.","June 2, 2015","false","0.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

It can keep you on your toes, changes each time you play, and has your favorite Achievement Hunter stars in it.  Who wouldn't want to play as Mayhem Michael, Brownman, Geoff 'Lazer' Ramsey, or Gavin.  There are more in this game, but why spoil the fun of finding all of the characters in this game.\n\nIt is a zombie survival with a twist... the zombies are aliens, or I should probably say the aliens are zombies.  I can't say much of the DLC for this game, since I can't play it.  Loading up the Bungalow DLC pack always crashes my game, but I'm keeping the pack, hopefully not in vain, in case they fix this issue.\n\nThis game has a few flaws to it: like some of the glitches, the saved characters will not listen to what you say (very much like the AH group themselves... Just joking btw.), and the lack of game availability.  It is one small area, with vending machines filled with CDs, saws, guns, and...pixelated swords?  ...never thought that I would say that in a sentance.  The music is good, but limited. (for those who post a video of this on YouTube, remove the music.  It will claim copyright violation and you will not be able to monetize you let's plays.  Ironic huh?)  The design is good, the characters look good, and the character strengths and weaknesses really fit the characters they portray.\n\nAll in all, it is a good game, but needs a little bit more to it.","January 10","true","12.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I have both the steam and mobile version and play them frequently. Now there are some things that don't work insanely well with the game that I will list.\n\n1) Making the game fullscreen will screw with the contorls they feel as though they need calibrating when this game is played in full screen.\n2) Occasionally some of the enemies (i've only experienced this in the first few levels) will get stuck and refuse to move out of their spawn. You can kill them with a ranged weapon but if you do not have a ranged weapon or enough cash to buy one from the machines then you will need to start over.\n3) Characters will attack enemies automatically despite having close ranged firearms. This will waste the ammo and cause them to throw away their weapons.\n\nIf you're a fan of RoosterTeeth then you will enjoy this game. Yes there are issues with the game but you can easily play though these and still enjoy the game. The character dialouge is hilarious and very accurate to the RoosterTeeth crew themselves. If anything this game is a great time waster and for £2 you can't go wrong.","September 7, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Plenty of bugs in the game, some graphic bugs, some functionality bugs, my character and various stuff on the map seem to keep appearing merely as black or I'd say a 'shadow' so its not visually very appealing, its technically playable, but unappealing. Now I wanted to try to alter the original configuration I set when I first started the game... to discover their is no way to alter the configuration after the first time, which is a major bother as if it was something wrong with that it means I now need to de-install, re-download and re-install the game... which isn't something I am happy about and I hope its not something I possibly would need to do regularly to deal with whatever issues this game might have. Anyhow, in the end I can't recommend it as it is, it need to be fixed before I can really recommend it, otherwise its not bad, its just a bit fairly simplistic game, but not bad.\n\n9 Feb 2015 Edit: Their seem to have been an update today, as of today the graphics works fine, doesn't seem to bug that I have seen, so it got better, I'd actually recommend the game now since it works much better, sure its still nothing crazy and its fairly simplistic, also its luck based as to what weapons you'll find, but its as much as I expected and so its fine for me.","February 5, 2015","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Little dialogue so the ones recorded just become very overused, the control is a bit wonky and unresponsive at times, the auto attacking is only good if you're in a great position otherwise you tell your party to run from the Brutes and they just go up and beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of it, only to die. Another big problem is the whole "Game ends if YOU die" and only you. I get the narrative point behind it but because my character is trying to run off from zombiens with another cast member and gets caught up because the controls to select a party member glitch out and suddenly you're only controlling the cast members, they're stranded with brains, grunts and plague carriers.\n\nStill I have to say that the game is enjoyable and really tries to ♥♥♥♥ with you by randomly spawning enemies. Without a grid pattern to determin their paths the trap setting may become difficult which only adds to the strategy of the game.

It's not good.\n\nBut at no point do I think it's bad. It's just... mediocre.\n\nFor their first game, Rooster Teeth have done a good job at making a passable video game. It just suffers from a myriad of issues, such as being a direct port from the iOS version, and lack of intuitive controls among others. But in all honesty, I went in expecting this kind of work.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's like a mansion built out of straw: it looks great, but has abysmal structures that make it up.","December 18, 2015","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
